[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.920]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.640]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.740]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.760]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.540]   This podcast is separate from my teaching
[00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.400]   and research roles at Stanford.
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.320]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.520]   to bring you zero cost to consumer information
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.520]   about science and science-related tools.
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:27.360]   Along those lines,
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.340]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.660]   Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.
[00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.360]   Athletic Greens is an all-in-one
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.280]   vitamin mineral probiotic drink.
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.900]   I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,
[00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.120]   and so I'm delighted that they're a sponsor of the podcast.
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.960]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.620]   is because I found it rather dizzying
[00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.840]   to know which vitamins and minerals to take,
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.960]   and Athletic Greens covers all my bases
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.440]   for vitamins and minerals.
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.160]   It also includes probiotics,
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.000]   and there are now a lot of data supporting the fact
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.500]   that probiotics are important for the gut brain access,
[00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.320]   for immunity, for metabolic health, endocrine health,
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.760]   many, many things.
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.640]   So I take Athletic Greens once, sometimes twice a day.
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.200]   I mix it with water and a little bit of lemon juice,
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.300]   and to me, it tastes delicious.
[00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.840]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.000]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.160]   and if you do that,
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.900]   they'll also give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.280]   There are a lot of data now showing
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.800]   that vitamin D3 is important for immune function
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.840]   and a number of other important biological processes.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.920]   In addition, if you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,
[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.000]   you'll get five free travel packs.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.660]   Travel packs make it easy to mix up Athletic Greens
[00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.720]   when you're in the car, on the plane,
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.240]   or generally on the road.
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.400]   So that's athleticgreens.com to get Athletic Greens,
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.720]   the year's supply of vitamin D3 and K2,
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.920]   and the five free travel packs.
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.000]   Our second sponsor of today's podcast is Headspace.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.540]   Headspace is a meditation app that makes meditation easy.
[00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.380]   I've been meditating on and off since I was 16 years old.
[00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.000]   I'm 45 now, so that's about 30 years
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.680]   of on and off meditation,
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.740]   and I confess, most of that time, it was off,
[00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.140]   meaning I find it really hard
[00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.420]   to stick to a meditation practice.
[00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.100]   A few years ago, I discovered Headspace
[00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.400]   while flying on JetBlue flights,
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.820]   'cause at that time, they were offering Headspace
[00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.560]   as something you could watch instead of TV or movies,
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.100]   and it made me feel great.
[00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.360]   I'd find that I arrived where I was going,
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.680]   more rested, more relaxed, and I got the Headspace app,
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.240]   and I started using it daily,
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.220]   and I've continued to use it daily.
[00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.220]   Headspace has a large number of meditations,
[00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.100]   all supported by science.
[00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.380]   There's also now just a tremendous amount of science
[00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.720]   supporting a meditation practice for all sorts of things,
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.040]   like improved sleep, reduced impulsivity,
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.600]   improved cognition.
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.360]   They're just a myriad of positive effects of meditation.
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.400]   The hardest thing is doing it, and Headspace makes that easy.
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.100]   If you want to try the Headspace app
[00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.080]   and all the meditations they have,
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.120]   you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer,
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.280]   and you'll get one month completely free
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.980]   of all the meditations they have.
[00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.840]   That's headspace.com/specialoffer
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.160]   to get one month free of Headspace.
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.940]   The third sponsor of today's podcast is Magic Spoon.
[00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.240]   Magic Spoon is a low carb, grain-free, keto-friendly cereal.
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.840]   As I've mentioned a few times before on this podcast,
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.760]   the way I eat throughout the day has everything to do
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.380]   with when I want to be alert and when I want to be sleepy.
[00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.600]   So in the first part of the day, I fast,
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.260]   because that enhances alertness.
[00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.440]   Then I eat keto.
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.520]   So my lunch and my afternoon meals are ketogenic.
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.080]   And then in the evening, I eat starches and vegetables
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.320]   because those aid the transition to sleep.
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.980]   So for me, Magic Spoon as a keto cereal is a great snack.
[00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.120]   It's really tasty.
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.840]   I don't actually mix mine with milk.
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:40.960]   I just eat it directly.
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.760]   They have a bunch of different flavors.
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.200]   I like the frosted flavor,
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.800]   also because it tastes like donuts,
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.120]   and I have a pastry affliction, and I love pastries.
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.720]   So Magic Spoon allows me to remain on keto during the day.
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.540]   It's healthy, it tastes great, I really enjoy it.
[00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:56.880]   So if you want to try Magic Spoon,
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.500]   you can go to magicspoon.com/huberman
[00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.640]   for a variety pack of different flavors.
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.540]   And if you put Huberman at checkout,
[00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.840]   you'll get $5 off the variety pack.
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.280]   That's magicspoon.com/huberman
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.960]   to try a variety pack of different flavors
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.940]   of Magic Spoon keto, grain-free, low carb cereal.
[00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.520]   Put Huberman at checkout, you get $5 off.
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.480]   A quick note before we begin today's discussion
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.320]   about the neuroscience of motivation.
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.400]   I'm pleased to announce that we have now captioned
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.360]   episodes one and two in Spanish,
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.380]   and soon all the episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.400]   will be captioned on YouTube in Spanish.
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.520]   We've used some of the revenue from the podcast
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.960]   to hire expert captioners, so it should be accurate.
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.920]   You might catch a mistake here or there,
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.800]   or a dialect difference from time to time,
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.660]   but by our read and by our experts' reads,
[00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:48.900]   it's all accurate.
[00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.200]   So we're very pleased that people who speak Spanish
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.720]   and digest information best in Spanish
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.620]   can now digest the information here on the podcast.
[00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.600]   Thanks to everyone for supporting the podcast,
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.280]   which allows us to broaden our reach in these ways.
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.280]   And we do hope to expand to other languages
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.760]   in the very near future.
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.240]   This month, we're talking all about
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.080]   the neuroscience of emotions.
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.520]   And today we're going to talk about
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.360]   an extremely important topic
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.160]   that's central to our daily life, and that's motivation.
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.760]   We're going to talk about pleasure and reward.
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.880]   What underlies our sense of pleasure or reward?
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.800]   We're going to talk about addictions.
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.160]   You can't have a discussion about pleasure and reward
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.520]   without having a discussion about addictions
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.020]   and the addictive properties of certain substances,
[00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.860]   as well as how to break free of addiction.
[00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.480]   As well, we're going to talk about the neurochemistry
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.720]   of drive and mindset.
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.560]   So all these themes are woven together
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.340]   in the context of emotions.
[00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:45.280]   Each one of them, of course,
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.960]   could also be its own entire month of the podcast.
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:48.800]   And in fact,
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.360]   we are going to have an entire month devoted to addiction.
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.600]   And I have a very special guest
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.560]   that's going to be joining us to talk about
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.960]   the science and clinical practices
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.660]   that we know are important for understanding
[00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.320]   and treating addiction.
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.160]   But for now,
[00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.840]   let's just talk about the neuroscience of motivation
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.320]   and reward of pleasure and pain,
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.340]   because those are central to what we think of as emotions,
[00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:12.440]   whether or not we feel good,
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.280]   whether or not we feel we're on track in life,
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.720]   whether or not we feel we're falling behind.
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.720]   So motivation is fundamental to our daily life.
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.960]   It's what allows us to get out of bed in the morning.
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.320]   It's what allows us to pursue long-term goals
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:26.880]   or short-term goals.
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:30.360]   Motivation and the chemistry of motivation
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:35.360]   is tightly wound in with the neurochemistry of movement.
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.080]   In fact, the same single molecule, dopamine,
[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.260]   is responsible for our sense of motivation
[00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.600]   and for movement.
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.600]   Even though nerves controlling muscles,
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.760]   so again, these are nerves in the spinal cord or brain
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.620]   that move our limbs,
[00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.480]   the effector chemical there,
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.720]   the one that actually causes the muscles to twitch,
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.080]   to contract, is acetylcholine.
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.700]   In the brain, acetylcholine is responsible for focus.
[00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.060]   However, whether or not we move,
[00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:04.780]   whether or not we want to move,
[00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:09.300]   whether or not we have the desire to overcome barriers,
[00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.100]   if you know, they could be social barriers
[00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:13.600]   or financial barriers or time constraints,
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.060]   that depends on this molecule we call dopamine.
[00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:17.880]   It's a fascinating molecule.
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:22.200]   And it lies at the center of so many great things in life.
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.980]   And it lies at the center of so many terrible aspects
[00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:27.020]   of life, namely addiction and certain forms
[00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:28.640]   of mental disease.
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:31.760]   So if ever there was a double-edged blade
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.400]   in the world of neuroscience, it's dopamine.
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.420]   So let's talk about what dopamine is.
[00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:39.400]   And as always, we are going to talk about actionable tools.
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.640]   Today, we're definitely going to talk about some things
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.020]   related to supplementation.
[00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:45.000]   Although you might be surprised to learn
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.540]   that it's not all just about increasing dopamine.
[00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:49.460]   And in particular, in some cases,
[00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:51.220]   that's the wrong thing to do.
[00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:54.060]   Sometimes it's appropriate, sometimes it's not.
[00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:56.920]   More so, we're going to talk about tools
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.540]   related to what's called dopamine scheduling,
[00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:01.320]   how the way that you're leading your life
[00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:03.540]   and the way that you're conceptualizing your goals
[00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:05.620]   can actually predict whether or not
[00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:08.260]   you're going to continue to pursue those goals
[00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:09.900]   and therefore whether or not you will succeed
[00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:11.460]   in achieving those goals,
[00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:14.100]   as well as whether or not you will quit.
[00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:16.020]   There's a fundamental relationship
[00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:18.320]   between dopamine released in your brain
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.580]   and your desire to exert effort.
[00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:23.200]   And you can actually control the schedule
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:24.140]   of dopamine release,
[00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:26.580]   but it requires the appropriate knowledge.
[00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:29.020]   This is one of those cases where understanding
[00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:30.460]   the way the dopamine system works
[00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:32.660]   will allow you to leverage it to your benefit.
[00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:35.380]   And if you don't understand the way that dopamine works,
[00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:38.580]   there's a good chance that it's going to pull you out
[00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:39.860]   into the current of life,
[00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:41.660]   meaning the rest of the world
[00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:43.840]   is going to control your dopamine schedules.
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:45.860]   So I'm excited to tell you about today's information.
[00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:47.100]   You're going to learn some basic science.
[00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:48.500]   You're going to learn a lot of tools.
[00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.240]   And these tools I believe are applicable
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.760]   whether or not you're five years old, eight years old,
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:55.140]   80 years old or anything in between.
[00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:56.780]   So let's talk about dopamine.
[00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:59.400]   Let's get a few basic facts on the table.
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:03.300]   Dopamine was discovered in the late 1950s,
[00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:06.040]   and it was discovered as the precursor,
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:08.900]   meaning the thing from which epinephrine
[00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:10.780]   or adrenaline is made.
[00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:13.000]   Now that's fundamentally important
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.840]   because this molecule we call dopamine nowadays,
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:19.620]   we think of as the molecule of reward and pleasure,
[00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:22.020]   but actually it is the substrate
[00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:24.280]   from which adrenaline is made.
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:25.360]   And in the brain,
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:28.060]   it's the substrate from which epinephrine is made.
[00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:30.260]   Epinephrine is the same thing as adrenaline,
[00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.820]   except in the brain we call it epinephrine.
[00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:35.520]   Epinephrine as you may recall from previous podcasts,
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:36.880]   or if you haven't, no problem.
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:41.020]   Epinephrine allows us to get into action.
[00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:43.260]   It stimulates changes in the blood vessels,
[00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.540]   in the heart, in the organs and tissues of the body
[00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:47.900]   that bias us for movement.
[00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:50.140]   And if you'd like to learn more about epinephrine,
[00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:53.780]   you can check out our episode on mastering stress.
[00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:55.600]   We talk a lot about it there.
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.260]   Dopamine was initially thought to be
[00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260]   just the building block for epinephrine.
[00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.460]   And it is indeed the chemical building block
[00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:03.660]   from which epinephrine is made.
[00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:06.180]   However, dopamine does a lot of things on its own.
[00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:09.200]   It's not always converted to epinephrine.
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.280]   Dopamine is released from several sites
[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:12.700]   in the brain and body,
[00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:15.120]   but perhaps the most important one for today's discussion
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:17.040]   about motivation and reward
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:20.320]   is something that's sometimes just called the reward pathway
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:21.400]   for the aficionados,
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:24.720]   it's sometimes called the mesolimbic reward pathway,
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.560]   but it's fundamentally important
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.960]   to your desire to engage in action.
[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.280]   And it's fundamentally important
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:36.520]   for people getting addicted to substances or behaviors.
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:37.920]   So how does this work?
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.740]   Well, you've got a structure in the deep part of your brain
[00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:44.100]   called the VTA, it stands for ventral tegmental area.
[00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:46.240]   As always, you don't have to remember these names,
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:48.240]   but if you want to, I offer them to you
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:51.640]   for further Googling, research, reading, et cetera.
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:55.140]   The VTA or ventral tegmental area contains neurons
[00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:58.480]   that send what we call axons, little wires,
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:01.440]   that spit out dopamine at a different structure
[00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:03.360]   called the nucleus accumbens.
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:06.080]   And those two structures, VTA and nucleus accumbens,
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:10.240]   form really the core machinery of the reward pathway
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:13.880]   and the pathway that controls your motivation for anything.
[00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:16.160]   You can think of them like an accelerator,
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.740]   they bias you for action.
[00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:22.400]   However, within the reward pathway, there's also a break.
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.840]   The break or restriction on that dopamine,
[00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:26.440]   which controls when it's released
[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:29.560]   and how much it's released is the prefrontal cortex.
[00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:31.900]   The prefrontal cortex is the neural real estate
[00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:33.720]   right behind your forehead.
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:36.160]   It's discussed for so many aspects of neuroscience,
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:39.240]   you hear about it for decision-making, executive function,
[00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:40.840]   for planning, et cetera.
[00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:42.580]   And indeed it's responsible for a lot of those.
[00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:44.640]   It's this really unique real estate
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:46.740]   that we were all endowed with as humans.
[00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:49.560]   Other animals don't have much of it, we have a lot of it.
[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:51.880]   And that prefrontal cortex acts as a break
[00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:53.360]   on the dopamine system.
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:56.240]   Without that break, you would be purely
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:58.320]   a pleasure seeking animal.
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.040]   You would be purely pleasure seeking.
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:04.300]   You would have no basis for regulating your behavior
[00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:07.760]   in terms of trying to get things that make you feel good.
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:12.080]   And that brings us to the important feature of motivation,
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:14.860]   which is that motivation is a two-part process,
[00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:19.060]   which is about balancing pleasure and pain, okay?
[00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:21.640]   Most people think about motivation and reward and dopamine
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:24.280]   as just trying to achieve pleasure.
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:27.840]   And indeed dopamine is released in the brain from the VTA
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:29.900]   at the nucleus accumbens
[00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:32.540]   when we experience things that we like.
[00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:34.940]   So here's the way to conceptualize this.
[00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:36.920]   And if you can internalize this in your mind,
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:39.280]   it will really help you as you move through your day
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:41.260]   trying to understand why you might be motivated
[00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.320]   or not motivated for certain things.
[00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:44.920]   So when you're just sitting around
[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:46.320]   not doing much of anything,
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:47.720]   maybe you wake up in bed in the morning,
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:50.480]   you're thinking about getting up or not,
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:53.920]   this reward pathway is releasing dopamine
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:56.880]   at a rate of about three or four times per second.
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:58.360]   It's kind of firing at a low level.
[00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:00.800]   When I say firing, I mean electrical activity in the neurons.
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:03.960]   So when you're just around, you feel okay, not depressed,
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:06.220]   not highly motivated, not excited,
[00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:09.080]   maybe three or four times a second.
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.500]   If suddenly you get excited about something,
[00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:14.720]   you anticipate something, not receive an award,
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:17.720]   but you get excited in an anticipatory way,
[00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:21.180]   then the rate of firing,
[00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:23.520]   the rate of activity in this reward pathway
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:26.840]   suddenly increases to like 30 or 40 times.
[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:30.400]   And it has the effect of creating a sense of action
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:32.160]   or desire to move in the direction
[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:33.680]   of the thing that you're craving.
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:37.320]   In fact, it's fair to say that dopamine is responsible
[00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:39.360]   for wanting and for craving.
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:41.160]   And that's distinctly different
[00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:43.240]   from the way that you hear it talked about normally,
[00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:44.920]   which is that it's involved in pleasure.
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:48.280]   So yes, dopamine is released in response to sex.
[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:49.800]   It's released in response to food.
[00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:52.400]   It's released in response to a lot of things,
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:55.280]   but it's mostly released in anticipation
[00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:57.600]   and craving for a particular thing.
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:00.160]   It has the effect of narrowing our focus
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.040]   for the thing that we crave.
[00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:04.240]   And that thing could be as simple as a cup of coffee.
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:07.180]   It could be as important as a big board meeting.
[00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:08.480]   It could be a big final exam.
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.720]   It could be the person that we're excited to meet
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:14.440]   or see dopamine doesn't care about what you're craving.
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:17.240]   It just releases at a particular rate.
[00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:19.200]   In fact, if we just take a step back
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.240]   and we look at the scientific data
[00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:25.240]   on how much the dopamine firing increases
[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:26.560]   in response to different things,
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:28.820]   you get a pretty interesting window
[00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:30.660]   into how your brain works
[00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:33.300]   and why you might be motivated or not motivated.
[00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:35.120]   Let's say you're hungry
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:37.640]   or you're looking forward to a cup of coffee
[00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:40.520]   or you're going to see your partner.
[00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:43.720]   Well, your dopamine neurons are firing at a low rate
[00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:46.400]   until you start thinking about the thing that you want
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:48.880]   or the thing that you're looking forward to.
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:51.360]   Let's say you're craving chocolate or a good meal,
[00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.600]   a steak if you like steak
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:56.120]   or a nice plate of pasta if you like pasta.
[00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:58.160]   When you eat that food,
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:14:59.920]   the amount of dopamine that's released
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:04.040]   in this reward pathway goes up about 50% above baseline.
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:06.640]   The neurons there go from firing
[00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:08.440]   three or four times per second
[00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:10.560]   to six or 10 times per second.
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:13.120]   It really depends and these aren't exact numbers
[00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:15.020]   but if we were to measure the amount of dopamine
[00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:18.640]   that's released, it goes up about 50%, all right?
[00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:21.540]   Sex, which is fundamental
[00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:24.760]   to our species continuation and reproduction
[00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:27.900]   although it doesn't have to be for conceiving children,
[00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:30.100]   sex does release dopamine
[00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:33.040]   and it increases dopamine levels about 100%.
[00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:34.460]   So basically doubles them.
[00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:38.160]   Nicotine of the sort that's in cigarettes
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:41.240]   or some people are taking nicotine in supplemental form
[00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:45.740]   increases the amount of dopamine about 150% above baseline.
[00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:48.260]   It also does some other things that we're going to talk about
[00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.600]   but nicotine does that
[00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:52.100]   and it's kind of interesting that nicotine
[00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:54.300]   would increase the amount of dopamine in your brain
[00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:57.640]   very quickly within seconds.
[00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:00.780]   That's 150 times over baseline
[00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:04.380]   as opposed to sex which is 100% above
[00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:06.940]   or food which is 50%.
[00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:09.660]   Cocaine and amphetamine increase the amount of dopamine
[00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:11.760]   that's released a thousand fold
[00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:14.980]   within about 10 seconds of consuming the drug.
[00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:19.000]   However, just thinking about food, about sex,
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.040]   about nicotine if you like nicotine
[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:23.700]   or cocaine or amphetamine
[00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:26.460]   can increase the amount of dopamine that's released
[00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:30.220]   to the same degree as actually consuming the drug.
[00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:31.540]   Now, it depends.
[00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:34.140]   In some cases, for instance, the cocaine user,
[00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:36.040]   the addict that wants cocaine
[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:37.880]   can't just think about cocaine
[00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:40.740]   and increase the amount that's released about a thousand fold
[00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:42.120]   it's actually much lower
[00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:44.720]   but it's just enough to put them on the motivation track
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:47.060]   for it to crave that particular thing.
[00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:48.260]   Now, there are reasons why
[00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:49.800]   you would have brain circuitry like this.
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:51.000]   I mean, brain circuitry like this
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.840]   didn't evolve to get you addicted.
[00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:56.400]   Brain circuitry like this evolved
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:59.560]   in order to motivate behaviors toward particular goals,
[00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:03.120]   water when you're thirsty, sex in order to reproduce.
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:04.400]   And we're going to talk about the relationship
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:06.880]   between estrogen and testosterone in the dopamine system
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:10.500]   because those hormones actually bias dopamine to be released.
[00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:13.780]   These things and these brain areas and neurons
[00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:16.640]   were part of the evolutionary history
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:19.280]   that led to the continuation of our species.
[00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:21.620]   Things like cocaine and amphetamine
[00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:23.240]   are disastrous for most people
[00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:25.440]   because they release so much dopamine
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:27.200]   and they create these closed loops
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:30.360]   where people then only crave the particular thing,
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:31.680]   cocaine and amphetamine,
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:34.480]   that leads to those massive amounts of dopamine release.
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:37.840]   Most things don't release that level of dopamine.
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:40.740]   Nowadays, there's a ton of interest in social media
[00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:42.340]   and in video games.
[00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:45.080]   And there have been some measurements
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:46.760]   of the amount of dopamine released.
[00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:49.000]   Video games, especially video games
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.040]   that have a very high update speed
[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:53.280]   where there's novel territory all the time.
[00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:55.700]   Novelty is a big stimulus of dopamine.
[00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:56.960]   Those can release dopamine
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:59.680]   somewhere between nicotine and cocaine.
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:02.600]   So very high levels of dopamine release.
[00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:04.700]   Social media is an interesting one
[00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:06.520]   because the amount of dopamine that's released
[00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.880]   in response to logging onto social media
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:10.740]   initially could be quite high,
[00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:13.400]   but it seems likely that there's a taper
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:14.920]   in the amount of dopamine,
[00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:16.720]   and yet people still get addicted.
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:17.540]   So why?
[00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:20.060]   Why is it that we can get addicted to things
[00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:23.840]   that fail to elicit the same massive amount of pleasure
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:25.520]   that they initially did?
[00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:28.040]   Being addicted to something isn't just about
[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:29.560]   the fact that it feels so good
[00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:31.040]   that you want to do it over and over again.
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:34.740]   And that's because of this pleasure pain balance
[00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:36.160]   that underlies motivation.
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:37.320]   So let's look a little bit closer
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:38.480]   at the pleasure pain balance
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:41.000]   because therein lies the tools
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.960]   for you to be able to control motivation
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:45.920]   toward healthy things and avoid motivated behaviors
[00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:48.140]   towards things that are destructive for you.
[00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:51.320]   There are a lot of reasons why people try novel behaviors,
[00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:52.580]   whether or not those are drugs
[00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:55.660]   or whether or not those are adventure thrill-seeking things,
[00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:57.660]   or they seek out new partners,
[00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:59.700]   or they take a new class.
[00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:02.040]   As you'll notice, I'm not placing any judgment
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:03.880]   or value on these different behaviors.
[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:05.540]   Although I think it's fair to point out
[00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:07.220]   that for most people,
[00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:10.880]   addictive drugs like cocaine and amphetamine
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.400]   are very destructive.
[00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:17.480]   Actually, we know that about 15 to 20% of people
[00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:20.680]   have a genetic bias towards addiction
[00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:23.700]   that you sometimes hear that the first time
[00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:26.220]   that you use a drug, you can become addicted to it.
[00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:28.120]   That's actually not been shown to be true
[00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:29.720]   for most things and most people,
[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:31.640]   but for some people that actually is true.
[00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:32.960]   And we'll talk a little bit later
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:35.760]   about why certain people are heavily biased
[00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:38.760]   toward becoming addicts on the first use
[00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:40.020]   of a particular drug.
[00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:41.120]   It's actually very interesting.
[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:43.000]   It has everything to do with whether or not
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.220]   they were formally addicted to something else.
[00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:49.400]   But in any case, the way that addiction works
[00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:51.560]   and the way that motivation works generally
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:53.120]   in the non-addictive setting
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:54.920]   is that when you anticipate something,
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:56.600]   a little bit of dopamine is released.
[00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:58.040]   And then when you reach that thing,
[00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:00.240]   you engage in that thing,
[00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:02.680]   the amount of dopamine goes up even further.
[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:05.540]   But as you repeatedly pursue a behavior
[00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:07.880]   and you repeatedly engage with a particular thing,
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:11.100]   let's say you love running or you love chocolate.
[00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:13.560]   As you eat a piece of chocolate,
[00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:15.880]   believe it or not, it tastes good.
[00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:20.400]   And then there's a shift away from activation of dopamine.
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:22.880]   And there are other chemicals that are released
[00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:25.760]   that trigger a low level sense of pain.
[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:27.760]   Now you might not feel it as physical pain,
[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:32.240]   but the craving that you feel is both one part dopamine
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:34.920]   and one part the mirror image of dopamine,
[00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:36.860]   which is the pain or the craving
[00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:39.080]   for yet another piece of chocolate.
[00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:41.440]   And this is a very important and subtle feature
[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:44.400]   of the dopamine system that's not often discussed.
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:46.180]   People always talk about it just as pleasure.
[00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:48.820]   You love social media, so it gives you dopamine.
[00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:49.680]   And so you engage in that.
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:51.960]   You like chocolate, it releases dopamine, so you do that.
[00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:54.460]   But for every bit of dopamine that's released,
[00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:57.160]   there's another circuit in the brain that creates,
[00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:58.200]   you can think of it as kind of like
[00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:00.240]   a downward deflection in pleasure.
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:02.160]   So you engage in something you really want,
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:03.640]   and there's an increase in pleasure.
[00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:07.720]   And then there's a, without you doing anything,
[00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:09.140]   there's a mirror image of that,
[00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:11.160]   which is a downward deflection in pleasure,
[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:12.400]   which we're calling pain.
[00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:13.960]   So for every bit of pleasure,
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:16.820]   there is a mirror image experience of pain.
[00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:19.180]   And they overlap in time very closely.
[00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:21.360]   So it's sometimes hard to sense this, but try it.
[00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:23.280]   The next time you eat something really delicious,
[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:25.120]   you'll take a bite, it tastes delicious.
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:28.880]   And part of the experience is to want more of that thing.
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:32.000]   This is true for any pleasureful experience.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.320]   Now, the diabolical part about dopamine
[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:36.600]   is that because it didn't evolve
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:38.220]   in order to get you to indulge
[00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:40.720]   in more and more and more of something,
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:44.120]   what happens is that initially,
[00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:47.460]   you experience an increase in pleasure,
[00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:50.820]   and you also experience this increase in pain shortly after
[00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:53.040]   or woven in with the pleasure
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:55.040]   that makes you want more of that thing.
[00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:57.840]   But with each subsequent time
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:59.640]   that you encounter that thing,
[00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:01.260]   that you pursue the chocolate,
[00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:04.120]   that you pursue the lover,
[00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:08.320]   each time the experience of dopamine release and pleasure
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:10.200]   is diminished a little bit.
[00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:14.480]   And the diabolical thing is that the pain response
[00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:16.400]   is increased a little bit.
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:18.120]   And this is best observed
[00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:20.320]   in the context of drug seeking behavior.
[00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:24.080]   The first time someone decides to take cocaine or amphetamine,
[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:25.520]   they may do it out of boredom.
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:27.040]   They may do it out of peer pressure.
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:29.660]   They may do it to relieve some internal sense.
[00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:31.280]   Maybe they're bored or they're just excited.
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:33.340]   Maybe they're high in novelty seeking.
[00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:36.260]   There are a lot of reasons why people might try a drug,
[00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:39.860]   far too many for us to get into or parse here.
[00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:40.840]   Maybe they don't even want to do it,
[00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:42.300]   but someone encourages them.
[00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:44.720]   They will experience a huge dopamine release
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:47.880]   and they will feel likely very good.
[00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:49.240]   However, the next time they take it,
[00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:50.960]   it won't feel quite as good.
[00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:52.400]   And it won't feel even as good
[00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:54.420]   the third time or the next time.
[00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:57.200]   But the amount of pain,
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:59.880]   the amount of craving that they experience for the drug
[00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:01.360]   will increase over time.
[00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:03.340]   So much of our pursuit of pleasure
[00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:06.640]   is simply to reduce the pain of craving.
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:08.920]   So the next time you experience something you really like,
[00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:10.580]   I don't want to take you out of that experience,
[00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:13.480]   but it's really important that you notice this,
[00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:15.820]   that if there's something you really enjoy,
[00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:19.240]   part of that enjoyment is about the anticipation
[00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:21.720]   and wanting of more of that thing.
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:24.200]   And that's the pain system in action.
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:26.320]   And so we can distinguish between dopamine,
[00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:27.620]   which is really about pleasure,
[00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:29.760]   and dopamine, which is really about motivation
[00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:34.760]   to pursue more in order to relieve or exclude future pain.
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:35.840]   Let me repeat that.
[00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:37.940]   Dopamine isn't as much about pleasure
[00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:42.360]   as much as it is about motivation and desire to pursue more
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:46.080]   in order to reduce the amount of pain.
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:49.060]   And we are now talking about pain as a psychological pain
[00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:49.900]   and a craving,
[00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:53.820]   but people that miss a lover very badly
[00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:57.100]   or that really crave a food very badly
[00:23:57.100 --> 00:24:01.140]   or that are addicted to a drug and can't access it
[00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:04.300]   will experience that as a physical craving
[00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:05.360]   and a mental craving.
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:07.480]   The body and brain are linked in this way.
[00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:09.440]   It's almost, they'll describe it as painful.
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:10.780]   They yearn for it.
[00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:12.240]   And I think the word yearning
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:14.280]   is one that's very valuable in this context
[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:18.320]   because yearning seems to include a whole body experience
[00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:21.680]   more than just wanting, which could just be up in the mind.
[00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:25.320]   So your desire for something is proportional
[00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:29.420]   to how pleasureful it is to indulge in that thing,
[00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:31.220]   but also how much pain you experience
[00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:32.640]   when you don't have it.
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:35.200]   And you can now start to let your mind wander
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:37.020]   into all sorts of examples of addictions
[00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:39.140]   or things that you happen to like.
[00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:41.080]   I'll use the example that I sometimes use on here,
[00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:42.500]   which is my love of croissants,
[00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:43.820]   although several of you pointed out
[00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:45.260]   these are called croissants,
[00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:46.940]   but then it sounds like I'm trying to speak French
[00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:48.880]   and I always tried to do that when I was a kid
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:50.740]   and I went to a bilingual school and it failed then,
[00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:51.620]   and it's going to fail now.
[00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:53.680]   So I'm going to call them croissants.
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:54.560]   They're delicious.
[00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:55.400]   I love them.
[00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:58.620]   A really good one makes me want to eat six.
[00:24:58.620 --> 00:24:59.460]   It's true.
[00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:01.640]   I have pretty good impulse control, I think,
[00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:04.060]   but it makes me want to eat six.
[00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:05.980]   I taste it and it tastes so delicious.
[00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:09.140]   And unless I really force myself
[00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:11.460]   to experience the taste of it in my mouth
[00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:13.400]   and how flaky I'm getting hungry for it right now
[00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:15.320]   and delicious the croissant is,
[00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:17.280]   mostly the taste of that croissant
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:19.200]   makes me want to eat more croissants.
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:21.200]   Now, eventually blood sugar goes up,
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.640]   satiety is reached, et cetera.
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:23.540]   What happens then?
[00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:25.880]   What is satisfaction and satiety about?
[00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:27.820]   Well, that's a separate neuromodulator.
[00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:30.520]   That's about the neuromodulator serotonin.
[00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:32.320]   It's about oxytocin.
[00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:34.260]   It's about a hormone system
[00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:35.820]   that involves something called prolactin.
[00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:38.220]   So we're going to talk about all of those
[00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:40.820]   in the book, "The Molecule of More," wonderful book.
[00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:44.360]   Those were described as the here and now molecules,
[00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:47.100]   the ones that allow you to experience your sensations
[00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:48.400]   and pleasure in the present
[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:51.660]   and for which the brain stops projecting into the future.
[00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:53.580]   So now let's talk about craving
[00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:55.980]   and these so-called here and now molecules
[00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:59.060]   and how those engage in a kind of push-pull balance
[00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:02.240]   that will allow you to not just feel more motivated,
[00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:04.460]   but also to enjoy the things in life
[00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:07.600]   that you are pursuing to a much greater degree.
[00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:09.520]   We have neurons in an area of our brain
[00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:12.220]   called the raphe, R-A-P-H-E.
[00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:15.160]   The raphe releases serotonin
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:16.740]   at different places in the brain.
[00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:20.920]   Serotonin is the molecule of bliss and contentment
[00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:22.560]   for what you already have.
[00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:25.580]   I've talked before about exteroception.
[00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:28.380]   Exteroception is a focus on the outside world,
[00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:31.020]   everything beyond the confines of your skin.
[00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:32.840]   I've also talked about interoception,
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:34.880]   a focus on things that are happening internally
[00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:36.540]   within the confines of your skin.
[00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:42.760]   Dopamine and serotonin can be thought of
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:45.200]   as related to exteroception.
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:47.580]   Dopamine makes us focused on things outside us
[00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:50.460]   that are beyond what we call our personal space
[00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:53.280]   where we actually have to move and take action
[00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:54.820]   in order to achieve things.
[00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:57.620]   And serotonin in general has to do with the things
[00:26:57.620 --> 00:26:59.320]   that are in our immediate here and now,
[00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:00.540]   hence the description of these
[00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:02.700]   as the here and now molecules.
[00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:07.300]   So it's interesting to point out that the body and the brain
[00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:10.300]   can direct its attention towards things outside us
[00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:12.480]   or inside us or split our attention between those.
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:14.040]   I talked about this in a previous podcast,
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:16.240]   but if you didn't see it, no problem.
[00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:18.620]   Just understand that dopamine biases us
[00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:20.780]   toward thinking about what we don't have.
[00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:23.420]   Whereas serotonin and some of the related molecules
[00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:25.560]   like the endocannabinoids,
[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:27.060]   if you picked up on the word cannabinoid,
[00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:29.820]   yes, it's like cannabis because cannabis
[00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:32.420]   attaches to endocannabinoid receptors.
[00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:35.280]   And the endocannabinoids are receptors and chemicals
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:37.460]   that the cannabinoids that you naturally make
[00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:40.080]   that are involved in things like forgetting.
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:42.180]   It's not a coincidence that pot smokers
[00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:43.700]   don't have the most terrific memory.
[00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:45.480]   You may know a few that have great memories,
[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:48.080]   but chances are they would have even better memories
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:50.240]   if they weren't pot smokers.
[00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:52.940]   But you make these molecules that bind to these receptors
[00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:54.720]   that make you feel kind of blissed out
[00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:56.760]   and content in the present.
[00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:58.660]   Those are receptors that exist in us,
[00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:03.100]   not for sake of consuming THC or marijuana,
[00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:07.320]   but for sake of binding of our natural endogenous cannabinoids.
[00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:08.520]   So you've got these two systems.
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.340]   They're kind of like a push-pull.
[00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:12.840]   And if you were to say, do the,
[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:14.820]   in the book, wherever you go, there you are,
[00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:17.480]   Jon Kabat-Zinn talks about this meditation practice
[00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:19.460]   that's different than most meditation practices
[00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:21.040]   where you eat one almond
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:23.780]   and you focus all of your attention on the almond,
[00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:26.380]   the taste of the almond, the texture of the almond.
[00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:28.700]   That's really a mindfulness practice
[00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:31.380]   that's geared towards trying to take a behavior
[00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:33.640]   which is normally about pursuit.
[00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:35.780]   Normally feeding is we're going,
[00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:38.040]   we engage in feeding because of dopamine.
[00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:39.220]   We pursue more of a food
[00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:40.820]   because of that pleasure-pain relationship
[00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:42.140]   I talked about before.
[00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:44.500]   The focus on the one almond
[00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:47.320]   or becoming very present in any behavior
[00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:49.100]   that normally would be a kind of
[00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:51.340]   exteroceptive pursuit behavior
[00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:53.460]   and bring it into the here and now,
[00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:57.980]   that's a mental trick or a mental task
[00:28:57.980 --> 00:29:00.740]   that the mindfulness community has really embraced
[00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:02.980]   in order to try and create increased pleasure
[00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:04.540]   for what you already have.
[00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:06.740]   It's really trying to accomplish a shift
[00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:08.700]   from dopamine being released
[00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:11.420]   to serotonin and the cannabinoid system
[00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:13.480]   being involved in that behavior.
[00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:15.460]   So if you're interested in mindfulness
[00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:17.380]   which is something I've talked about before in this podcast
[00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:20.020]   and I sort of made some off the cuff jokes
[00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:22.480]   about the opposite of mindfulness being mindlessness.
[00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:24.080]   Mindfulness is a vast space.
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:25.600]   That is a mindful practice
[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:26.980]   that a lot of people have engaged in.
[00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:29.620]   And indeed it can give you deeper appreciation
[00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:31.440]   for things that you already have.
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:33.740]   Dopamine has the quality of making people
[00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:35.920]   kind of rabidly in pursuit of things.
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:38.060]   Look at people who are high on cocaine or amphetamine
[00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:41.080]   and they are almost entirely exteroceptive.
[00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:45.820]   Drugs like marijuana, the opioids,
[00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:50.220]   anything that really hits the serotonin system hard
[00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:52.140]   tend to make people rather lethargic
[00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:53.740]   and content to stay exactly where they are.
[00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:56.020]   They don't want to pursue much at all.
[00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:59.460]   Occasionally when people smoke marijuana
[00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:01.680]   or consume THC, their appetite goes way up
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:03.340]   and they really want to consume food.
[00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:05.660]   That's because of its effects on insulin
[00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:07.140]   and its effects on blood sugar
[00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:09.020]   which is a slightly separate matter.
[00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:11.260]   But since some of you probably your minds
[00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:14.180]   might've gone to those either experiences
[00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:18.220]   or reports of what pot does, that's why it does that.
[00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:20.400]   So you've got these molecules like dopamine
[00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:22.180]   that make you focused on the things you want
[00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:23.220]   and the things you crave.
[00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:24.700]   And then you've got the molecules
[00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:26.860]   that make you content with what you have.
[00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:30.040]   So the most important thing perhaps
[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:32.940]   in creating a healthy emotional landscape
[00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:33.900]   is to have a balance
[00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:36.140]   between these two neuromodulator systems.
[00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:38.300]   People that are always in anticipation
[00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:40.360]   and desire and seeking,
[00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:42.740]   that's wonderful for pursuing goals.
[00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:45.180]   However, it's terrible for enjoying life.
[00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:46.000]   And actually those people
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.740]   are actually quite difficult to be around.
[00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:50.420]   There's a certain almost sociopathic element
[00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:53.140]   to people who are what they call hyper dopaminergic.
[00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:56.140]   People who are always on the dopaminergic scale
[00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:59.300]   to the point where they are always pursuing goals.
[00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:01.600]   In fact, those people are known to be
[00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:03.740]   at least in the psychological spectrum
[00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:05.540]   they can be very manipulative.
[00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:07.820]   Dopamine and the pursuit of something
[00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:10.080]   doesn't necessarily have to be high energy
[00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:12.180]   and intense from the outside
[00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:13.640]   when you observe it from the outside.
[00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:16.300]   In fact, there are people who will manipulate
[00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:17.920]   in order to get what they want.
[00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:19.100]   This has been shown
[00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:21.220]   who have high levels of dopamine release in their brain
[00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:24.380]   but they've learned that a kind of passive manipulation
[00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:27.420]   is the best way to maneuver through a particular environment.
[00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:29.900]   I don't want to focus too much on sociopathy
[00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:32.860]   because those are kind of extreme examples
[00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:37.460]   but it just goes to show that people who identify a goal
[00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:39.820]   and realize the series of steps that they need to take
[00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:40.980]   in order to achieve that goal
[00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:43.580]   can either do it through ethical means or non-ethical means.
[00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:45.100]   They can do it through active pursuit
[00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:46.580]   being the kind of type A person
[00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:48.060]   that's always declaring their goals
[00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:50.060]   and going after it, posting it on Instagram,
[00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:53.100]   telling everybody about it, trying to recruit others.
[00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:54.420]   There's that phenotype.
[00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:57.860]   There's that kind of signature of dopamine.
[00:31:57.860 --> 00:31:58.920]   And then there are the people
[00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:00.420]   that want to get what they want
[00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:02.400]   and they're doing it by always serving other people,
[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:04.340]   by always taking care of everybody else's needs,
[00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:07.080]   by always trying to accomplish their goals
[00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:09.800]   but through a mode that at least from the outside
[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:13.680]   seems more passive or more about supporting others.
[00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:15.580]   Neither of these are good or bad
[00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:17.820]   and that's because dopamine is a molecule.
[00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:20.420]   It doesn't care how you reach your goals.
[00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:22.540]   It only cares that you reach your goals
[00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:24.740]   because the internal sensation
[00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:29.220]   is one again of mild pleasure, a little bit of pain,
[00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:30.680]   although more pain over time
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:32.480]   if you're not reaching those goals
[00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:36.380]   and it takes you away from the here and now.
[00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:38.200]   So at about this point in the podcast,
[00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:40.120]   I'm guessing that some of you are thinking,
[00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:41.820]   okay, great, I want more dopamine.
[00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:43.220]   I want to be more motivated.
[00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:45.280]   I don't want to procrastinate as much
[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:47.740]   and I want to be able to experience life.
[00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:50.760]   I want these here and now molecules to be released as well.
[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:52.080]   Well, there is a way to do that
[00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:55.460]   but you have to understand the source of procrastination
[00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:57.020]   is not one thing.
[00:32:57.020 --> 00:32:59.220]   There are basically two kinds of procrastinators
[00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:01.300]   or so says the research.
[00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:04.520]   The first kind are people that actually really enjoy
[00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:07.740]   the stress of the impending deadline.
[00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:09.560]   It's the only way they can get into action.
[00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:13.380]   These are people that really like the feeling of
[00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:15.260]   something being due in an hour
[00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:17.940]   and how activated and sharp and focused
[00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:19.380]   that makes them feel.
[00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:23.140]   Those people are people that are tapping into
[00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:25.320]   the epinephrine system, the stress system
[00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:28.580]   and for which the stress really tightens their ability
[00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:31.620]   to see, it creates that soda straw view of the world.
[00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:33.820]   It creates an action element in the body
[00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:35.700]   that makes them feel like they want to move.
[00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:39.360]   It really eliminates all the distractions for them.
[00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:43.020]   So they're actually leveraging stress, internal stress
[00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:44.740]   in order to achieve a state
[00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:47.640]   that they can't seem to otherwise achieve.
[00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:49.780]   I won't tell you what to do in order to overcome
[00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:51.100]   all kinds of procrastination
[00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:54.520]   but from a logical perspective, it makes sense therefore
[00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:56.780]   for those kinds of people to think about other ways
[00:33:56.780 --> 00:33:58.940]   that they can get their system into activation.
[00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:00.520]   I've talked about this in previous podcasts
[00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:03.000]   but a couple of those tools might be
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.300]   the what we've called super oxygenation breathing
[00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:07.700]   which I admit is not always super oxygenating.
[00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:11.100]   So this would be, if you didn't want to consume anything
[00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:16.100]   this could be 25 or 30 cycles of deep inhales and exhales.
[00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:20.000]   It's likely to create some anxiety and low level stress.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.680]   If you're someone who's prone to panic attacks
[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:24.300]   I wouldn't recommend this, but it's pretty straightforward.
[00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:26.200]   It will deploy adrenaline into your system
[00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:29.020]   and you will find that your visual field is focused
[00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:31.660]   and you will be able to work and focus better
[00:34:31.660 --> 00:34:33.240]   than if you just kind of waited around
[00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:37.120]   for some wave of motivation to wash over you.
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:40.020]   Normally you're waiting for that deadline to come into sight
[00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:41.840]   and then that's what the stimulus is
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:43.880]   but you can self-direct adrenaline release
[00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:45.460]   without ingesting anything.
[00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:49.540]   You can also ingest coffee, caffeine or mate
[00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:50.380]   or something like that
[00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:53.440]   which is what I prefer very often to coffee
[00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:54.420]   which has caffeine.
[00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:57.240]   Caffeine does release dopamine at low levels.
[00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:59.660]   How much it releases dopamine isn't clear.
[00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:02.500]   It seems to increase firing in these neurons
[00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:04.540]   in the nucleus accumbens by about 30%
[00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:07.540]   which is a pretty low level, but it can create agitation.
[00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:11.660]   So for caffeine sensitive people, that could be a problem.
[00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:14.020]   I've talked before about things like L-tyrosine
[00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:16.860]   the precursor to dopamine or Mucuna purines.
[00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:18.260]   I talked about that in the last episode
[00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:19.700]   but if you didn't see that, just to remind you
[00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:23.920]   L-tyrosine is present in red meats, it's in certain nuts
[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:27.280]   and L-tyrosine is the precursor to dopamine.
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:29.220]   You can supplement L-tyrosine if you like
[00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:31.200]   you will get a big inflection in dopamine
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:33.100]   but there is a crash associated with it.
[00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:36.940]   However, it will increase motivation in the short term.
[00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:38.180]   Not suggesting anyone do this.
[00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:39.980]   I want to be very clear, say what I always say.
[00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:42.060]   I'm not a doctor, I don't prescribe anything.
[00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:43.860]   I'm a professor, I profess things.
[00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:46.380]   You have to know whether or not these things are appropriate
[00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:48.760]   for your mental and physical health or not.
[00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:50.140]   So you need to consult a doctor.
[00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:53.180]   For instance, people who suffer from schizotypal
[00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:55.700]   or schizophrenia or mania should probably not
[00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:59.020]   be taking supplements that increase their dopamine levels.
[00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:02.780]   Now, if you can't increase your level of focus
[00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:04.300]   and your level of alertness and your level
[00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:05.980]   of motivation using breathing,
[00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:08.660]   well then there might be something else at play.
[00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:11.420]   There are other procrastinators for which they simply
[00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:12.980]   are not releasing enough dopamine.
[00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:15.060]   They're not making enough dopamine.
[00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:17.660]   And for those people, there are a variety of things
[00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:18.780]   that can increase dopamine.
[00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:21.180]   I do suggest you talk to a psychiatrist or doctor.
[00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:22.700]   I've talked about Mucuna purines
[00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:27.700]   which is 99.9% L-DOPA, the precursor to dopamine.
[00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:31.060]   So there are people that do much better
[00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:34.820]   when they take things that increase their dopamine levels.
[00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:39.020]   There are antidepressants like wellbutrin, bupryron
[00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:41.240]   which increase, is the other name for it,
[00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:43.360]   which increase dopamine and epinephrine.
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:45.480]   It can increase risk of epileptic attacks
[00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:46.320]   if you're epileptic.
[00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:48.180]   So again, you have to talk to your doctor
[00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:51.520]   but they will increase dopamine and motivation and focus.
[00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:55.360]   However, if you think back to our earlier discussion
[00:36:55.360 --> 00:37:00.360]   about dopamine, dopamine, if it's very high,
[00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:04.040]   creates a sense of pleasure and the desire for more.
[00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:06.420]   So you can also become a person
[00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:08.860]   for which enough is never enough.
[00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:11.120]   The only thing that dopamine really wants
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:13.280]   is more of the thing that releases dopamine.
[00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:15.180]   And so big inflections in dopamine,
[00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:16.780]   whether or not they come from cocaine
[00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:17.660]   or whether or not they come
[00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:21.540]   from a supplementation caffeine exercise study regime
[00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:24.480]   will just make you want more of something.
[00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:26.900]   And we've all heard before of growth mindset,
[00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:29.300]   this incredible discovery of my colleague, Carol Dweck
[00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:30.900]   or some of these positive mindsets
[00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:32.940]   that the psychology community has put forth
[00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:35.080]   as really good for pursuit of goals
[00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:38.940]   and pursuit of things that require long bouts of effort.
[00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:41.860]   Well, it's wonderful if you can learn to attach dopamine
[00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:44.120]   to that process psychologically,
[00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:46.500]   but if you're starting to augment the amount of dopamine,
[00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:47.760]   increase the amount of dopamine
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:50.740]   through things like supplementation and prescription drugs,
[00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:53.440]   what's going to happen is you're not only going to need
[00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:55.840]   to pursue more and more of the sorts of things
[00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:58.300]   that are associated with the dopamine.
[00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:01.780]   So doing more studying, more sport, more pursuit,
[00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:05.020]   higher mountains, more money, more whatever.
[00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:09.340]   But we know that over time, the mirror image of that,
[00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:12.700]   the pain of lack of accomplishment will also increase.
[00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:14.420]   This is the pleasure pain relationship
[00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:15.940]   that we talked about earlier.
[00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:17.940]   So in a few moments, I'm going to talk about
[00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:21.100]   how to think about healthy dopamine schedules,
[00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:23.580]   but I just want to take a step back for a second
[00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:26.580]   and talk a little bit about the flip side of dopamine.
[00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:29.560]   What happens after this so-called dopamine crash?
[00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:32.340]   What mechanisms are installed in us?
[00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:33.160]   Because believe it or not,
[00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:35.620]   there are mechanisms that are installed in all of us
[00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:39.100]   that really put the complete and total break on dopamine,
[00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:41.460]   why they're there and what they do,
[00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:43.500]   because you've experienced these before,
[00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:46.620]   and there are actually ways that you can navigate them,
[00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:48.500]   these dopamine crashes
[00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:51.340]   or these intentional dopamine suppression mechanisms
[00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:54.380]   in order to leverage healthier dopamine schedules
[00:38:54.380 --> 00:38:56.240]   and to feel more motivated.
[00:38:56.240 --> 00:39:00.940]   Perhaps one of the most fundamental mechanisms in all humans
[00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:04.620]   is the neural circuitry designed for seeking out mates
[00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:06.220]   and for reproduction.
[00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:09.220]   And that's because the continuation of any one species
[00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:12.660]   is the primary driver for any species.
[00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:13.960]   That's just the reality.
[00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:15.700]   Now I'm removing all context here.
[00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:17.700]   So whatever I say, of course,
[00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:22.700]   it's on a backdrop of consensual, age appropriate,
[00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:27.260]   species appropriate, context appropriate, all of that.
[00:39:27.260 --> 00:39:30.120]   This is not about the sociology of reproduction in sex.
[00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:31.820]   This is about the biology.
[00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:35.420]   The biology of sex in males and females,
[00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:38.400]   it doesn't matter if it's XX chromosome, XY chromosome,
[00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:41.380]   XXY, XYY, it doesn't matter.
[00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:45.780]   The reality is that dopamine is released on anticipation
[00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:48.900]   and consummation of sex and reproduction.
[00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:53.820]   And after orgasm, regardless of chromosomal background,
[00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:57.140]   there's a dramatic decrease in dopamine
[00:39:57.140 --> 00:40:00.140]   and an increase in a hormone called prolactin.
[00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:02.980]   Now, prolactin is associated with milk letdown
[00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:05.320]   in lactating mothers.
[00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:08.100]   It's also present in males.
[00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:11.740]   And in general, prolactin creates a sense of lethargy,
[00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:14.540]   of stillness and lack of desire to move
[00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:16.500]   and lack of desire to pursue more
[00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:18.940]   of whatever released the dopamine.
[00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:21.760]   Prolactin in fact sets the refractory period
[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:25.120]   on a male's ability to mate again.
[00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:27.300]   Now, this is going to vary tremendously
[00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:28.880]   from individual to individual.
[00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:33.180]   There are data showing that it can vary tremendously
[00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:35.340]   from mate pairing to mate pairing.
[00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:39.220]   The number one thing that releases dopamine is novelty.
[00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:42.960]   And it is true that the refractory period is shortened
[00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:44.820]   by the introduction of novel mates.
[00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:47.700]   This was first shown in a kind of classic experiment
[00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:50.520]   of all things in chickens.
[00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:52.480]   This is called the Coolidge effect.
[00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:54.940]   And the story is, the story goes,
[00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:56.140]   and I believe it's a true story.
[00:40:56.140 --> 00:40:58.820]   It's actually in all the neuroendocrinology textbooks.
[00:40:58.820 --> 00:41:02.180]   So I believe it's true, is that President Calvin Coolidge
[00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:05.820]   was visiting a chicken farm.
[00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:07.700]   They were just being taken around.
[00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:10.540]   And the person who was hosting the visit
[00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:12.500]   showed them a rooster.
[00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:15.140]   That was Coolidge and his wife were on the visit.
[00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:20.140]   And said, this rooster copulates thousands of times per day.
[00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:23.860]   And Mrs. Coolidge apparently kind of elbowed
[00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:25.840]   President Coolidge and said, you hear that?
[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:29.000]   Kind of like pointing out the prowess of this rooster.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.560]   And Coolidge said, yeah, but let me ask you a question,
[00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:34.560]   same hen or different hens?
[00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:36.320]   It turns out it was different hens.
[00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:38.700]   And the reason is the introduction of a novel mate
[00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:40.920]   increases dopamine levels.
[00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:45.920]   And what's interesting about this is that after copulation,
[00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:47.640]   prolactin goes through the roof
[00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:49.800]   and prevents further copulation.
[00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:51.960]   Dopamine crashes.
[00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:55.180]   But the introduction of some sort of novelty shortens this.
[00:41:55.180 --> 00:42:00.180]   Now, this is not a ploy for people to change mates often.
[00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:03.140]   What this is is a story about the dopamine
[00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:06.380]   and prolactin system that also exists in humans.
[00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:09.380]   Now, there are actually things that people
[00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:12.340]   in certain communities take in order to bypass
[00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:13.340]   these refractory periods.
[00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:16.520]   There's actually drugs that increase dopamine,
[00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:19.020]   suppress prolactin and vice versa.
[00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:21.780]   There's actually another way to suppress prolactin.
[00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:26.780]   Vitamin B6 is a fairly potent prolactin inhibitor
[00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:28.140]   as is zinc.
[00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:29.900]   And if you look out there in the literature
[00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:31.120]   and for those of you that are in the wellness
[00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:32.700]   and kind of sports performance community,
[00:42:32.700 --> 00:42:36.840]   a lot of the so-called quote unquote testosterone boosters
[00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:40.880]   are actually combinations of vitamin B6 and zinc
[00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:42.420]   which inhibit prolactin.
[00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:45.900]   And by way of inhibiting prolactin increase dopamine.
[00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:49.980]   So they do have some functional effect in that regard.
[00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:51.900]   They're not really increasing testosterone directly.
[00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:54.540]   They're suppressing prolactin levels.
[00:42:54.540 --> 00:42:57.420]   And there are clinical conditions like hyperprolactinemia
[00:42:57.420 --> 00:43:01.300]   which leads to massive decreases in libido, et cetera.
[00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:02.760]   And there are prescription drugs
[00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:06.140]   to treat hyperprolactinemia, which of course,
[00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:07.700]   you should always talk to an endocrinologist
[00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:09.780]   about those sorts of prescription drugs.
[00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:12.660]   So it's interesting that this very basic mechanism
[00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:15.500]   of dopamine and prolactin, this sort of motivation,
[00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:18.300]   no, no more motivation is a system
[00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:20.140]   that evolved for reproduction first
[00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:21.860]   but that actually takes place.
[00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:25.100]   And you can see elsewhere in the world.
[00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:27.740]   For instance, schizophrenia,
[00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:30.760]   a disease that has many different types and facets
[00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:35.260]   but schizophrenia is a case of often of hyperactivation
[00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:37.060]   of the dopamine system.
[00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:39.600]   So much so that it can make people feel kind of high.
[00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:40.460]   They hallucinate.
[00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:42.180]   I mean, we're talking very, very high
[00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:46.220]   or dysregulated dopamine circuits in the brain.
[00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:49.780]   One of the treatments for schizophrenia
[00:43:49.780 --> 00:43:52.760]   are drugs that block dopamine receptors.
[00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:55.620]   And if you have the, it's unfortunate,
[00:43:55.620 --> 00:43:57.460]   there are so many people that are out on the street
[00:43:57.460 --> 00:43:59.140]   these days who have schizophrenia,
[00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:01.800]   some of whom are taking their meds, some of whom aren't.
[00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:04.100]   If you ever see somebody on the street
[00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:07.380]   that's doing what's, it's like a lip smacking and writhing,
[00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:09.820]   it's actually called tardive dyskinesia.
[00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:12.700]   This is a movement disorder
[00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:16.300]   that's created by taking these anti-dopaminergic drugs.
[00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:18.920]   So you can imagine these anti-dopaminergic drugs
[00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:21.220]   while being very effective in suppressing hallucinations,
[00:44:21.220 --> 00:44:23.340]   they create these movement problems
[00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:27.580]   because of dopamine's importance for the movement circuitry,
[00:44:27.580 --> 00:44:30.100]   so-called pyramidal circuitry for the aficionados.
[00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:32.940]   In addition, you sometimes see in males
[00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:35.660]   that take these drugs, drugs like haloperidol
[00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:37.920]   and the other dopamine blockers,
[00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:39.460]   that they actually develop breast tissue,
[00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:41.060]   gynecomastia.
[00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:43.500]   So the development of male breast tissue
[00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:46.140]   is because of the elevated levels of prolactin
[00:44:46.140 --> 00:44:48.540]   because they're suppressing their dopamine so much.
[00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:50.060]   Now that's a really extreme case,
[00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:53.740]   but maybe perhaps if you see somebody
[00:44:53.740 --> 00:44:56.100]   engaging in these very strange kind of face writhing
[00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:57.700]   and body writhing behaviors,
[00:44:57.700 --> 00:45:00.060]   that's actually not a consequence of their mental illness,
[00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:03.160]   that's a consequence most often of the drugs
[00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:04.980]   that they're taking to treat the mental illness,
[00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:07.080]   those are side effects of those drugs.
[00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:09.740]   Now, prolactin is increased anytime
[00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:12.340]   we have some really heightened, intense experience,
[00:45:12.340 --> 00:45:15.740]   it's not just released after sex and reproduction,
[00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:19.240]   prolactin is released after some major event,
[00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:20.800]   it's actually responsible,
[00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:24.440]   it's thought for some of postpartum depression
[00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:27.160]   for different types of kind of the letdown, the low.
[00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:30.080]   I can distinctly remember that after finals
[00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:33.340]   or after publishing a big paper,
[00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:34.760]   I would be very, very happy,
[00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:37.740]   but then I'd find that, oh, like what next?
[00:45:37.740 --> 00:45:40.300]   Or things might seem a little bit dimmed or dulled out
[00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:42.560]   for the next day or so or the following week.
[00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:43.940]   The timescales on these are going to vary
[00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:45.900]   because some people release a lot of dopamine
[00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:48.620]   for a very long time in response to something great
[00:45:48.620 --> 00:45:51.660]   and other people have a quick inflection of dopamine
[00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:53.360]   and then they're back to feeling not so great,
[00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:55.440]   it really varies from person to person.
[00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:57.680]   In fact, long ago,
[00:45:57.680 --> 00:45:59.820]   as I learned about dopamine reward circuitry
[00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:02.860]   and the relationship between dopamine and prolactin,
[00:46:02.860 --> 00:46:05.340]   I started to leverage this, believe it or not,
[00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:07.060]   after some major event,
[00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:11.860]   I would take a couple hundred milligrams of vitamin B6.
[00:46:11.860 --> 00:46:14.020]   I think for people who have diabetic neuropathy,
[00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:16.140]   you need to be careful with vitamin B6,
[00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:17.060]   check with your doctor.
[00:46:17.060 --> 00:46:19.860]   I was told, although I haven't found the literature on this,
[00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:24.020]   that it can in some cases exacerbate peripheral neuropathy,
[00:46:24.020 --> 00:46:28.320]   but for most people, it's thought to be reasonably safe,
[00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:31.000]   but again, always check with your physician,
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:34.220]   but I would take some B6 to kind of offset some of that low
[00:46:34.220 --> 00:46:36.080]   and actually, I don't know if it was subjective or not,
[00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:40.300]   but it seemed to have somewhat of a positive effect.
[00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:43.060]   I also started just internalizing the fact
[00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:44.900]   that dopamine is so subjective.
[00:46:44.900 --> 00:46:47.200]   There are objective aspects to dopamine
[00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:48.500]   and how much is released,
[00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:51.540]   but there's also some subjective effects to dopamine
[00:46:51.540 --> 00:46:53.580]   and so one of the things that you can do
[00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:56.180]   in order to generally just be a happier person,
[00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:58.700]   especially if you're a person in pursuit of long-term goals
[00:46:58.700 --> 00:47:02.900]   of any kind is the longer that you can extend
[00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:05.660]   that positive phase of the dopamine release
[00:47:05.660 --> 00:47:09.460]   and the more that you can blunt the pain response to that,
[00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:11.460]   the better and you can actually do this cognitively.
[00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:14.740]   I used to joke with my lab that when we'd publish a paper,
[00:47:14.740 --> 00:47:16.340]   I would get really excited,
[00:47:16.340 --> 00:47:18.660]   but I wouldn't allow myself to get too excited.
[00:47:18.660 --> 00:47:19.820]   What I wanted to do instead
[00:47:19.820 --> 00:47:23.100]   and what I've still tried to do is try and extend the arc
[00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:25.840]   of that positive experience as long as I possibly can
[00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:27.880]   simply by thinking back like, oh, that was really cool.
[00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:29.260]   I really enjoyed doing that work.
[00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:31.500]   I really enjoyed the discovery.
[00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:33.280]   I really enjoyed doing that with the people
[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:35.480]   that I was working with at the time.
[00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:37.060]   What a pleasure that was.
[00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:39.240]   I can get this very easily from pictures of people
[00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:41.680]   and things like Costello that I really enjoy,
[00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:42.960]   trips that I've taken.
[00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:45.560]   So you can extend pleasure without having to engage
[00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:47.540]   in the behavior over and over.
[00:47:47.540 --> 00:47:50.300]   That's extending the arc of that dopamine release.
[00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:52.660]   As well, it offsets some of the pain
[00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:55.880]   of not having that experience occur
[00:47:55.880 --> 00:47:57.460]   over and over and over again.
[00:47:57.460 --> 00:47:59.000]   Now for the high performers out there,
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:00.600]   you're probably familiar with this.
[00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:02.340]   Many people who have a big achievement,
[00:48:02.340 --> 00:48:04.260]   their first thoughts are, well, now what?
[00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:05.220]   What am I going to do next?
[00:48:05.220 --> 00:48:06.420]   How am I ever going to exceed that?
[00:48:06.420 --> 00:48:09.020]   And indeed many people who are very high
[00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:10.700]   on this kind of dopamine sensation
[00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:13.780]   and novelty seeking scale are prone to addiction.
[00:48:13.780 --> 00:48:16.620]   They're prone to the rabid pursuit of external goals,
[00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:20.200]   of exteroception to the neglect of these internal mechanisms
[00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:22.260]   that allow them to feel calm and happy.
[00:48:22.260 --> 00:48:25.240]   So for people that are very driven, very motivated,
[00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:28.440]   adopting a practice of being able to engage
[00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:31.000]   in the here and now, the sort of almond type practices
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:34.860]   we talked about earlier of learning how to achieve
[00:48:34.860 --> 00:48:37.200]   a really good night's sleep on a regular basis
[00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:39.240]   through tools and mechanisms I talked about
[00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:42.000]   in previous podcasts gives a sort of balance
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:45.800]   to the pleasure seeking and offsetting of pain
[00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:47.840]   and the pleasure in the here and now.
[00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:49.520]   So pleasure is really two things.
[00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:52.560]   It's a joy in pursuit,
[00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:55.560]   but it's also the joy in what you have.
[00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:58.880]   And there's a beautiful model of emotional development
[00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:00.560]   that was developed by Alan Shore,
[00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:02.640]   a professor at UCLA and psychiatrist
[00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:04.840]   that talks about some of the basics
[00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:07.600]   of good infant parent attachment,
[00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:09.700]   where good parenting that leads
[00:49:09.700 --> 00:49:14.120]   to healthy adult relationships and emotion regulation
[00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:16.240]   tends to include both sides
[00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:19.480]   of this dopamine serotonin spectrum.
[00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:21.800]   You talk about the relationship between child
[00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:24.840]   and parent typically was the mother, but also father,
[00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:27.340]   where you can get the child really excited
[00:49:27.340 --> 00:49:29.080]   by kind of squealing and ramping them up
[00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:31.320]   or talking about something or ice cream or play.
[00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:32.720]   And the kid gets very excited.
[00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:34.080]   That's the dopaminergic system,
[00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:36.600]   the anticipation of something that's coming,
[00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:39.380]   but as well, engaging with children in a way
[00:49:39.380 --> 00:49:41.040]   that's really about everything that you have
[00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:43.640]   right in the here and now, the reading of the book,
[00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:46.900]   the kids always seem to ask one more time, one more,
[00:49:46.900 --> 00:49:49.000]   they seem to want more of the things that they enjoy,
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.860]   but really engaging with them in a way
[00:49:51.860 --> 00:49:54.080]   that increases their sense of pleasure
[00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:55.480]   for what's right there,
[00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:57.000]   as well as giving them a lot of things
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:00.360]   to be excited about and positive anticipation.
[00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:04.000]   Now, having worked years ago with at-risk kids
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:05.900]   and also with young kids at summer camps
[00:50:05.900 --> 00:50:08.200]   and things like that, one of the things that you learn
[00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:11.500]   is you never say maybe to a kid about a reward.
[00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:13.480]   If you say we might have ice cream later,
[00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:16.000]   you are essentially saying we are having ice cream.
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:17.400]   They don't hear the maybe part.
[00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:19.860]   And it turns out adults don't either.
[00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:20.720]   It's really interesting.
[00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:22.940]   There's something called reward prediction error.
[00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:24.080]   I've talked about this before,
[00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:26.140]   but I haven't really talked about it deeply
[00:50:26.140 --> 00:50:28.300]   in the context of the dopamine system.
[00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:31.240]   Dopamine, as I've said, is involved in anticipation
[00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:33.420]   of wanting, not of having.
[00:50:33.420 --> 00:50:36.340]   It's involved in motivation toward the thing that you want,
[00:50:36.340 --> 00:50:38.360]   and it biases us towards action.
[00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:42.640]   Reward prediction error equals the actual amount of dopamine
[00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:44.480]   that's released in response to something
[00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:48.160]   versus minus the amount that's expected, okay?
[00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:51.500]   So if you tell a kid we might have ice cream,
[00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:54.520]   they hear we're going to have ice cream, and they expect it.
[00:50:54.520 --> 00:50:56.760]   And if you later say, well,
[00:50:56.760 --> 00:50:59.640]   we're not going to have ice cream, and I said maybe,
[00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:00.660]   that's actually going to lead
[00:51:00.660 --> 00:51:03.680]   to a much bigger crash in dopamine.
[00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:07.540]   It's going to lead to a negative signal, a punishment signal.
[00:51:07.540 --> 00:51:09.760]   It's literally going to feel like pain.
[00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:12.260]   So kids, you can leverage this.
[00:51:12.260 --> 00:51:13.500]   If your parents say maybe,
[00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:16.660]   they're effectively telling your dopamine system absolutely.
[00:51:16.660 --> 00:51:18.160]   Now, adults are like this too.
[00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:21.760]   If we think something might happen and it doesn't happen,
[00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:25.440]   there's a big crash in our affect, in our emotionality.
[00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:27.680]   And that's because that dopamine system goes from firing
[00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:29.600]   about three to four times per second
[00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:31.920]   to about 10 or 15 times per second
[00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:34.660]   in the possibility that something might happen.
[00:51:34.660 --> 00:51:37.740]   Possibility is deeply woven into our biology
[00:51:37.740 --> 00:51:40.120]   of the dopamine and motivation system
[00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:43.320]   as a way for us, presumably in ancient times,
[00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:45.640]   to explore novel territories and get a sense
[00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:46.920]   that maybe there's water there.
[00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:48.360]   Maybe there are mates there.
[00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:49.640]   Maybe there's better food there.
[00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:51.440]   Maybe there's resources there.
[00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:55.860]   The maybe is an important thing that in language terms,
[00:51:55.860 --> 00:51:59.360]   maybe means maybe, but in neurobiological terms,
[00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:02.500]   maybe means perhaps there's going to be the surprise
[00:52:02.500 --> 00:52:04.800]   of an even bigger dopamine reward.
[00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:06.360]   And the one thing dopamine loves
[00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:09.520]   more than anything else is surprise.
[00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:12.200]   When we get something positive, we go to the mailbox,
[00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:14.120]   we're expecting some bills and you open it up
[00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:15.400]   and you get a letter from somebody
[00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:16.920]   you haven't thought about in a long time
[00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:21.300]   and you adore that person, that's a huge dopamine release.
[00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:22.800]   It actually triggers neuroplasticity.
[00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:24.040]   You probably never forget that
[00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:27.480]   because of the way that dopamine gates plasticity.
[00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:32.160]   When we get a surprise of something that we didn't want,
[00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:34.520]   also it creates plasticity.
[00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:38.080]   So the surprise, novelty, motivation, and reward,
[00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:41.440]   they're all woven into this package that we call dopamine.
[00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:44.520]   And the cool thing is you can actually regulate
[00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:48.800]   this whole system in a way that will steer you
[00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:51.560]   or lean you towards more positive anticipation
[00:52:51.560 --> 00:52:53.560]   of things in life and less disappointment.
[00:52:53.560 --> 00:52:55.120]   It's simply a matter of adjusting
[00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:57.560]   what we call the dopamine schedule.
[00:52:57.560 --> 00:52:59.960]   Okay, a couple of things before we continue.
[00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:01.700]   We're going to talk about attention deficit
[00:53:01.700 --> 00:53:03.280]   in a few minutes, but before that,
[00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:05.740]   I want to talk about something that I've mentioned before
[00:53:05.740 --> 00:53:10.360]   in previous podcasts, but that you may not be aware of.
[00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:13.760]   And if you're aware of, you may still be doing,
[00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:18.160]   which is severely injuring your ability to release dopamine.
[00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:20.660]   It's creating a sense of disappointment
[00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:23.160]   in ways that are most likely hurting you
[00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:24.240]   mentally and physically.
[00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:27.440]   And that's the blunting of dopamine
[00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:30.400]   by viewing light in the middle of the night.
[00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:31.800]   I realize this is not a discussion
[00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:33.200]   about sleep and circadian rhythms,
[00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:35.440]   but the data now are so strong showing
[00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:40.320]   that viewing bright light from about 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.,
[00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:43.680]   too often triggers activation of this circuit
[00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:44.940]   called the habenula.
[00:53:44.940 --> 00:53:47.280]   So this is I to, it goes from your retina
[00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:51.080]   to a structure called the habenula, H-A-B-E-N-U-L-A.
[00:53:51.080 --> 00:53:53.960]   Then from the habenula to some of this reward circuitry
[00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:57.280]   and it suppresses the activation of the reward circuitry,
[00:53:57.280 --> 00:53:58.800]   not just in that moment,
[00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:00.360]   but to things that you normally
[00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:02.960]   positively anticipate and pursue.
[00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:04.160]   And the reason I'm bringing this up now
[00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:05.560]   is because I haven't really gone into depth
[00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:06.720]   on the dopamine system before.
[00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:09.780]   Now you understand you have this very precious reward system
[00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:11.860]   that's kind of a double-edged sword.
[00:54:11.860 --> 00:54:14.320]   It needs to be taken care of and treated well.
[00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:17.440]   You want to use it, but not overuse it, et cetera.
[00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:20.240]   But getting bright light exposure in the middle of the night
[00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:23.160]   is reducing your capacity to release dopamine.
[00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:24.440]   So it's not just about the sleep
[00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:25.760]   that you're not getting in that time.
[00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:29.480]   It's also that you're not getting the dopamine
[00:54:29.480 --> 00:54:31.220]   that would otherwise be available to you.
[00:54:31.220 --> 00:54:32.680]   So you're actually taking,
[00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:34.580]   think of light in the middle of the night
[00:54:34.580 --> 00:54:36.000]   as a kind of antagonist,
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:37.880]   as kind of a blocker of dopamine.
[00:54:37.880 --> 00:54:39.240]   Maybe that'll help you.
[00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:40.340]   If you're somebody who has to work
[00:54:40.340 --> 00:54:41.300]   in the middle of the night
[00:54:41.300 --> 00:54:43.980]   and you want to bypass this dopamine suppression,
[00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:46.480]   please see the episode about jet lag and shift work,
[00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:47.560]   because there are a lot of tips there
[00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:49.000]   that will allow you to do that.
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:51.640]   In order to understand how to control the dopamine system,
[00:54:51.640 --> 00:54:53.940]   how to leverage it for a better life,
[00:54:53.940 --> 00:54:56.720]   you need to understand the results
[00:54:56.720 --> 00:54:58.480]   of a very important experiment.
[00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:03.620]   This experiment was able to separate pleasure
[00:55:03.620 --> 00:55:05.000]   from motivation.
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:08.560]   It's a very simple, but like many simple experiments,
[00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:10.840]   a very elegant experiment.
[00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:11.680]   What they did,
[00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:15.080]   and this has now been done in animals and in humans,
[00:55:15.080 --> 00:55:17.200]   they offered rats food.
[00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:19.640]   It was a food that they particularly liked.
[00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:22.380]   And the animals would lever press for a pellet of food,
[00:55:22.380 --> 00:55:23.680]   kind of classic experiment.
[00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:26.980]   They'd eat the food and they presumably liked the food
[00:55:26.980 --> 00:55:30.080]   because they were motivated to press the lever and eat it.
[00:55:30.080 --> 00:55:31.040]   Great.
[00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:32.440]   They took other rats.
[00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:35.780]   They eliminated the dopamine neurons.
[00:55:35.780 --> 00:55:37.780]   You can do this by injection of a neurotoxin
[00:55:37.780 --> 00:55:39.540]   that destroys these neurons.
[00:55:39.540 --> 00:55:41.800]   So they actually had no dopamine in their brain.
[00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:44.360]   They have no ability to release dopamine.
[00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:46.800]   And they gave them a lever.
[00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:48.480]   The rats would sit there and they'd hit the lever
[00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:49.400]   and they'd eat the food.
[00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:51.680]   They're still enjoyed the food.
[00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:53.580]   So you say, well, okay,
[00:55:53.580 --> 00:55:55.480]   so dopamine isn't involved in motivation
[00:55:55.480 --> 00:55:56.840]   and it isn't involved in pleasure.
[00:55:56.840 --> 00:55:58.880]   No, it absolutely is.
[00:55:58.880 --> 00:56:01.120]   They could still enjoy the food,
[00:56:01.120 --> 00:56:04.860]   but if they moved the rat literally one body length
[00:56:04.860 --> 00:56:06.620]   away from the lever,
[00:56:06.620 --> 00:56:08.680]   what they found was the animals that had dopamine
[00:56:08.680 --> 00:56:10.760]   would move over to the lever, press it and eat.
[00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:11.720]   And the ones,
[00:56:11.720 --> 00:56:14.580]   the rats that did not have dopamine available to them
[00:56:14.580 --> 00:56:19.080]   wouldn't even move one body length, one rat length
[00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:22.020]   to the lever in order to press it and get the food.
[00:56:22.020 --> 00:56:24.560]   Dopamine therefore is not about
[00:56:24.560 --> 00:56:26.760]   the ability to experience pleasure.
[00:56:26.760 --> 00:56:29.840]   It is about motivation for pleasure.
[00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:31.780]   This has been repeated in humans
[00:56:31.780 --> 00:56:33.740]   in a variety of different scenarios.
[00:56:33.740 --> 00:56:36.640]   You can't really do the lever press thing quite as easily,
[00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:40.820]   but we know that people that have low levels of dopamine
[00:56:40.820 --> 00:56:42.600]   are simply less motivated
[00:56:42.600 --> 00:56:44.480]   even though they can achieve pleasure.
[00:56:44.480 --> 00:56:46.800]   And this has serious ramifications
[00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:51.400]   for the fact that now quote unquote pleasure
[00:56:51.400 --> 00:56:55.640]   or ways to induce things that we believe give us pleasure
[00:56:55.640 --> 00:56:57.520]   are everywhere and they're within reach.
[00:56:57.520 --> 00:56:59.000]   We don't have to forage for our food.
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:03.360]   There's a lot of highly processed, high sugar, high fat,
[00:57:03.360 --> 00:57:06.080]   foods, there's also foods that are healthy that tastes good
[00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:08.320]   but they're, and hopefully they're pretty easy to get
[00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:10.320]   all that different people have different access
[00:57:10.320 --> 00:57:11.840]   to things of course.
[00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:15.420]   But dopamine isn't about the ability to experience pleasure.
[00:57:15.420 --> 00:57:19.420]   It's about how motivated you are to reach those pleasures.
[00:57:19.420 --> 00:57:21.500]   And so many of you are probably thinking,
[00:57:21.500 --> 00:57:23.420]   wow, I'm not a very motivated person.
[00:57:23.420 --> 00:57:24.260]   Like you talked about
[00:57:24.260 --> 00:57:25.620]   the one kind of procrastination earlier.
[00:57:25.620 --> 00:57:28.880]   What about when I just feel kind of meh about life?
[00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:30.160]   Now, for some of you,
[00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:31.760]   there may be a real clinical depression
[00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:33.200]   and you should talk to a professional.
[00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:35.680]   There are very good prescription drugs
[00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:37.360]   that can really help people.
[00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:41.520]   There's also great non-drug treatments of psychotherapy
[00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:43.800]   and other treatments that are being developed
[00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:45.020]   in addition to psychotherapy
[00:57:45.020 --> 00:57:47.600]   and the various kinds of psychoanalysis, et cetera
[00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:48.860]   that one can use.
[00:57:48.860 --> 00:57:50.380]   I think the data really points to the fact
[00:57:50.380 --> 00:57:54.740]   that a combination of pharmacology and talk therapies
[00:57:54.740 --> 00:57:55.680]   are generally best.
[00:57:55.680 --> 00:57:57.260]   And there are a huge range of these things.
[00:57:57.260 --> 00:57:58.800]   I know many of you are in these professions.
[00:57:58.800 --> 00:58:00.600]   We're not going to talk about that right now.
[00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:02.600]   There is a compound that's kind of interesting
[00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:03.640]   in the supplement space
[00:58:03.640 --> 00:58:06.600]   that isn't Mucuna purines L-DOPA.
[00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:08.520]   It's not L-tyrosine.
[00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:12.520]   That isn't promoting massive releases of dopamine
[00:58:12.520 --> 00:58:14.420]   or even dopamine alone,
[00:58:14.420 --> 00:58:17.000]   but a combination of dopamine and serotonin.
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:18.800]   And it's an intriguing molecule.
[00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:20.480]   It's sold over the counter.
[00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:24.060]   Again, you have to check with your healthcare provider
[00:58:24.060 --> 00:58:26.080]   before you would take anything or remove anything.
[00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:27.200]   That's very important.
[00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:33.320]   But it's phenylethylamine or PEA.
[00:58:33.320 --> 00:58:39.900]   PEA or beta phenylethylamine releases dopamine at low levels
[00:58:39.900 --> 00:58:44.600]   but also serotonin at low level.
[00:58:44.600 --> 00:58:48.560]   So it's kind of a cocktail of the motivation molecules
[00:58:48.560 --> 00:58:51.720]   as well as the quote unquote here and now molecules.
[00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:55.600]   And people's response to this varies widely
[00:58:55.600 --> 00:58:58.800]   but many people report feeling heightened sense
[00:58:58.800 --> 00:59:01.200]   of mental acuity, wellbeing, et cetera.
[00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:02.920]   It is a bit of a stimulant
[00:59:02.920 --> 00:59:04.520]   like anything that triggers activation
[00:59:04.520 --> 00:59:06.720]   of the dopamine and norepinephrine pathway
[00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:08.080]   but it is an interesting supplement.
[00:59:08.080 --> 00:59:10.620]   I actually haven't tried it before.
[00:59:10.620 --> 00:59:12.240]   So I can't report on my own experiences.
[00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:15.940]   I will point you however, to examine.com.
[00:59:15.940 --> 00:59:17.920]   It wouldn't be a Huberman Lab podcast episode
[00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:19.420]   if I didn't point you to examine.com
[00:59:19.420 --> 00:59:21.180]   this incredible free resource
[00:59:21.180 --> 00:59:23.000]   where you can put in any supplement
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:24.220]   and it will tell you the quote unquote
[00:59:24.220 --> 00:59:25.480]   human effect matrix.
[00:59:25.480 --> 00:59:27.200]   It'll point you to the various studies.
[00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:29.000]   We always provide a link to this in the caption.
[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:30.640]   It's an amazing resource.
[00:59:30.640 --> 00:59:32.880]   So you can go there to explore more
[00:59:32.880 --> 00:59:37.880]   but I haven't talked about beta phenylethylamine before
[00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:39.000]   in previous podcasts.
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:41.920]   And I wanted to add it to the list of things
[00:59:41.920 --> 00:59:46.020]   that tap into the dopamine system that are in this
[00:59:46.020 --> 00:59:49.280]   I guess we call it now the supplementation space.
[00:59:49.280 --> 00:59:52.340]   I personally am fascinated by these supplements
[00:59:52.340 --> 00:59:54.200]   and the things that exist out there
[00:59:54.200 --> 00:59:57.360]   that are non-prescription that seem to
[00:59:57.360 --> 01:00:00.280]   at least in some people have positive effects.
[01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:01.400]   For instance, last episode,
[01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:03.360]   we talked about acetyl-l-carnitine
[01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:05.320]   which there are several papers
[01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:06.880]   that report antidepressant effects
[01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:08.960]   as well as positive effects on other things,
[01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:12.040]   sperm health, ovarian health, et cetera.
[01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:15.640]   I learned from a colleague that acetyl-l-carnitine in Europe
[01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:16.920]   is actually a prescription drug.
[01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:19.120]   In the US it's sold over the counter.
[01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:20.880]   So I guess depending on where you're listening to this
[01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:22.800]   the availability might vary.
[01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:24.280]   And as always, I put the caveat
[01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:25.760]   you have to check with your healthcare provider
[01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:26.600]   if it's right for you.
[01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:29.880]   But I'm fascinated by the fact that these things exist
[01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:32.600]   and that they lie somewhere between
[01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:34.780]   prescription drugs and doing nothing.
[01:00:34.780 --> 01:00:37.040]   And that makes them interesting compounds.
[01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:40.960]   And I think that PEA, beta phenylethylamine
[01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:44.500]   is yet another one of such compounds.
[01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:48.620]   I'm going to talk a lot about attention deficit
[01:00:48.620 --> 01:00:50.860]   and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
[01:00:50.860 --> 01:00:52.220]   in a future episode.
[01:00:52.220 --> 01:00:53.600]   But I do want to mention it today
[01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:57.020]   in the context of dopamine and impulsivity.
[01:00:57.020 --> 01:00:58.980]   So ADHD or ADD,
[01:00:58.980 --> 01:01:01.820]   so attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,
[01:01:01.820 --> 01:01:03.740]   ADD are clinical diagnoses.
[01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:05.840]   I think a lot of people nowadays walk around
[01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:08.980]   and say, I have ADD or you have ADD.
[01:01:08.980 --> 01:01:12.380]   And indeed one can create a sort of ADD
[01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:14.780]   by attention switching all the time.
[01:01:14.780 --> 01:01:16.600]   I'm a big fan of Cal Newport.
[01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:18.520]   He wrote the book "Deep Work."
[01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:20.540]   I believe he was the one who said
[01:01:20.540 --> 01:01:22.980]   context switching is terrible for the brain.
[01:01:22.980 --> 01:01:24.620]   It's like the worst thing for the brain
[01:01:24.620 --> 01:01:27.280]   because then the brain learns to context switch
[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:29.860]   and real deep work, productivity,
[01:01:29.860 --> 01:01:31.180]   learning of all kinds,
[01:01:31.180 --> 01:01:32.560]   good relationships of all kinds
[01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:34.380]   really come from depth of experience,
[01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:38.320]   not from breadth of experience within the moment.
[01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:40.780]   And so I think it's important to know
[01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:43.400]   that there's clinical ADHD and ADD.
[01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:46.800]   And then there's the kind that people are kind of inducing
[01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:51.480]   and through distraction and social media and phones, et cetera
[01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:56.480]   and those can sometimes lead to clinical ADHD and ADD.
[01:01:56.480 --> 01:02:01.920]   But I want to talk about ADHD and ADD in kids just briefly.
[01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:06.040]   The drugs that are normally given to treat those conditions,
[01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:09.800]   ADHD and ADD are things like Adderall,
[01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:12.600]   things that have very amphetamine like qualities
[01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:13.680]   and structures.
[01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:17.540]   And you might ask, why would they do that?
[01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:20.040]   Well, it turns out that in kids,
[01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:22.660]   these activate that forebrain circuitry,
[01:02:22.660 --> 01:02:27.500]   the break that exists on the deeper mesolimbic circuitry.
[01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:29.760]   So as you recall, there's the VTA and nucleus accumbens,
[01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:31.600]   that's the kind of accelerators on dopamine.
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:32.940]   And then there's the prefrontal cortex,
[01:02:32.940 --> 01:02:36.120]   which acts as a break and can limit impulsivity.
[01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:39.240]   And those drugs tend to increase the activity of neurons
[01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:41.440]   in that pathway, the prefrontal cortex,
[01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:42.920]   and it reduces impulsivity.
[01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:45.800]   In fact, there's a experiment described in the book,
[01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:48.180]   "The Molecule of More," which is really interesting,
[01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:51.720]   where they looked at impulsivity in obese children.
[01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:55.400]   And it turns out, they did this experiment in a safe way,
[01:02:55.400 --> 01:03:00.160]   that they looked at kids, both obese kids and non-obese kids
[01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:03.700]   and their willingness to cross a very busy highway.
[01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:06.440]   And it turns out that the obese kids got hit by cars
[01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:09.600]   more often than non-obese children.
[01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:11.880]   It turns out this was a virtual reality experiment
[01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:13.880]   that had nothing to do with the fact that they were obese
[01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:16.640]   or limitations on movement or speed of movement.
[01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:18.900]   It was that the obese children were more impulsive
[01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:20.120]   in a variety of contexts,
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:22.660]   not just in this virtual crossing the street thing.
[01:03:22.660 --> 01:03:25.560]   And it turns out the data points to the fact
[01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:29.160]   that impulsivity at age 10 is actually predictive
[01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:32.940]   of overeating disorders at a later stage in life.
[01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:35.140]   So some of these drugs that are designed
[01:03:35.140 --> 01:03:38.440]   to create heightened activity in the braking system,
[01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:42.140]   the decelerator of the reward pathway
[01:03:42.140 --> 01:03:44.080]   are designed to reduce impulsivity
[01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:46.480]   because they suppress the release of dopamine
[01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:50.000]   and they allow, hopefully they allow children
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.140]   and when they become adults,
[01:03:52.140 --> 01:03:55.680]   to better control the schedule of dopamine release.
[01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:57.880]   So now let's talk about what is a dopamine schedule
[01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:00.000]   and how you can leverage this
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.880]   in order to have heightened levels of motivation,
[01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:05.160]   but not get so much dopamine that you're experiencing
[01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:06.540]   or crash afterwards.
[01:04:06.540 --> 01:04:09.100]   And also so that you can experience heightened pleasure
[01:04:09.100 --> 01:04:12.520]   from the various pursuits that you are engaged in in life.
[01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:15.500]   I know many of you are interested in tools
[01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:18.020]   that will allow you to be more motivated,
[01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:21.080]   to focus longer, sleep better.
[01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:23.500]   That's really what the Huberman Lab Podcast is all about,
[01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:26.100]   but always framed in the context
[01:04:26.100 --> 01:04:30.440]   of neurobiological principles and objective mechanisms.
[01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:32.580]   There are some tools that we can apply
[01:04:32.580 --> 01:04:35.360]   to the dopamine system and motivation
[01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:37.240]   that can really improve our ability
[01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:39.240]   to stay in pursuit of things,
[01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:42.920]   as well as enjoy things after we've achieved our goals
[01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:45.300]   or even en route to our goals.
[01:04:45.300 --> 01:04:47.020]   And here's the key principle.
[01:04:47.020 --> 01:04:51.100]   Dopamine is very subjective,
[01:04:51.100 --> 01:04:53.340]   meaning you can either allow yourself
[01:04:53.340 --> 01:04:56.240]   to experience the pleasure of reaching a milestone,
[01:04:56.240 --> 01:05:00.700]   of achieving or some craving or not.
[01:05:00.700 --> 01:05:03.940]   Now that won't work in the extreme cases of drugs
[01:05:03.940 --> 01:05:05.620]   like cocaine and amphetamine,
[01:05:05.620 --> 01:05:07.620]   but it's actually pretty powerful
[01:05:07.620 --> 01:05:10.460]   what one can do with the subjective system.
[01:05:10.460 --> 01:05:12.500]   In fact, I'm going to describe to you an experiment
[01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:16.120]   that highlights just how powerful the subjective readout
[01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:17.940]   or the subjective interpretation
[01:05:17.940 --> 01:05:19.540]   of a given experience really can be,
[01:05:19.540 --> 01:05:22.200]   even at the level of pharmacology.
[01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:24.840]   I love examples of subjective effects
[01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:27.520]   over things that would otherwise seem hardwired
[01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:30.160]   because they really illustrate the interplay
[01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:33.700]   between our cognition, our belief system,
[01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:36.480]   and what would otherwise be these
[01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:38.960]   just plug and chug kind of mechanisms
[01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:41.180]   of you eat X amount of chocolate
[01:05:41.180 --> 01:05:43.100]   or you drink X amount of water
[01:05:43.100 --> 01:05:45.560]   after being water deprived for a certain amount of time
[01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:47.140]   and you get X amount of dopamine.
[01:05:47.140 --> 01:05:48.460]   Here's the experiment.
[01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:52.660]   The experiment was just published on March 18th, 2021,
[01:05:52.660 --> 01:05:53.860]   so very recently.
[01:05:53.860 --> 01:05:55.340]   And the title of the experiment
[01:05:55.340 --> 01:05:58.220]   is "Expectation for Stimulant Type
[01:05:58.220 --> 01:06:01.940]   Modifies Caffeine's Effects on Mood and Cognition."
[01:06:01.940 --> 01:06:03.380]   This was done in college students.
[01:06:03.380 --> 01:06:05.280]   And it's a fascinating study.
[01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:09.940]   What they did is they gave college students
[01:06:09.940 --> 01:06:13.620]   either placebo, essentially nothing,
[01:06:13.620 --> 01:06:15.380]   or 200 milligrams of caffeine.
[01:06:15.380 --> 01:06:18.620]   200 milligrams of caffeine is about what's in,
[01:06:18.620 --> 01:06:20.560]   well, a typical coffee,
[01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:23.440]   like a medium coffee that you would buy, a drip coffee,
[01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:25.280]   or a coffee that you'd make at home.
[01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:26.460]   It's a fair amount of caffeine.
[01:06:26.460 --> 01:06:27.900]   If you were to take it in pill form,
[01:06:27.900 --> 01:06:29.540]   it would definitely make you feel more alert
[01:06:29.540 --> 01:06:32.220]   unless you were one of those mutants, literally mutants,
[01:06:32.220 --> 01:06:34.580]   that is insensitive to caffeine.
[01:06:34.580 --> 01:06:36.300]   And those mutants are pretty rare.
[01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:40.780]   So they took 65 undergraduate students in college.
[01:06:40.780 --> 01:06:44.320]   They randomized them to either placebo or caffeine,
[01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:47.860]   and they told them that they were either getting caffeine
[01:06:47.860 --> 01:06:49.280]   or Adderall.
[01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:52.060]   Now, Adderall cognitively carries
[01:06:52.060 --> 01:06:55.460]   a very different expectation.
[01:06:55.460 --> 01:06:56.900]   College students know Adderall
[01:06:56.900 --> 01:06:59.420]   to be a much stronger stimulant than caffeine.
[01:06:59.420 --> 01:07:01.700]   They know it to create a sort of high,
[01:07:01.700 --> 01:07:03.480]   this is the way the students described it,
[01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:06.660]   and they thought that it would increase their level of focus
[01:07:06.660 --> 01:07:08.380]   and their ability to perform work.
[01:07:08.380 --> 01:07:10.380]   So what's really interesting is there was
[01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:13.660]   definitely an effect of placebo versus caffeine.
[01:07:13.660 --> 01:07:15.360]   That's not surprising, however, right?
[01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:19.160]   You take a placebo, you may or may not feel more alert,
[01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:20.660]   but you take 200 milligrams of caffeine,
[01:07:20.660 --> 01:07:22.340]   very likely you're going to feel very alert.
[01:07:22.340 --> 01:07:25.820]   But there was also an effect of whether or not
[01:07:25.820 --> 01:07:28.960]   the students thought they were getting caffeine or Adderall.
[01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:31.500]   The subjects receiving caffeine reported feeling
[01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:33.780]   more stimulated, anxious, and motivated
[01:07:33.780 --> 01:07:36.220]   than the subjects that received the placebo, okay.
[01:07:36.220 --> 01:07:38.180]   But the ones that expected Adderall
[01:07:38.180 --> 01:07:40.120]   reported stronger amphetamine effects.
[01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:42.100]   So they felt much more high.
[01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:45.380]   They performed better on a working memory test.
[01:07:45.380 --> 01:07:49.020]   And in general, they had all the increased
[01:07:49.020 --> 01:07:52.400]   cognitive effects that would have been seen with Adderall,
[01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:54.340]   but they were only ingesting caffeine.
[01:07:54.340 --> 01:07:58.340]   And so this shows an interaction between the drug, caffeine,
[01:07:58.340 --> 01:08:01.360]   and the expectation that it was Adderall.
[01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:04.500]   So it led to heightened performance simply because
[01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:06.420]   the students thought they were getting Adderall.
[01:08:06.420 --> 01:08:09.820]   Now, I don't know whether or not they told them at the end
[01:08:09.820 --> 01:08:11.500]   that it wasn't Adderall, I doubt that they did.
[01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:13.500]   This, if you want to look it up,
[01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:16.240]   the study was published in the Journal of
[01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:19.180]   Experimental Clinical Psychopharmacology.
[01:08:19.180 --> 01:08:23.220]   The paper is Looby et al, L-O-O-B-Y et al.
[01:08:23.220 --> 01:08:26.380]   And again, it was just published March 18th, 2021,
[01:08:26.380 --> 01:08:28.560]   speaks to the fact that yes,
[01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:30.420]   there are so-called placebo effects,
[01:08:30.420 --> 01:08:31.780]   but this is different than placebo.
[01:08:31.780 --> 01:08:34.900]   This is a belief effect about what the specific reactions
[01:08:34.900 --> 01:08:37.320]   to a given stimulant ought to be.
[01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:39.660]   And I think this is very important because I think that
[01:08:39.660 --> 01:08:43.420]   it points to the fact that the top-down,
[01:08:43.420 --> 01:08:45.340]   the kind of higher level cognitive processes
[01:08:45.340 --> 01:08:49.100]   are impacting even the most basic fundamental aspects of,
[01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:52.580]   say dopamine release or adrenaline release
[01:08:52.580 --> 01:08:54.160]   or epinephrine release in ways that can
[01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:56.180]   positively impact performance.
[01:08:56.180 --> 01:08:57.940]   In this case, it was a positive improvement
[01:08:57.940 --> 01:09:00.000]   in working memory and focus.
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:01.480]   As long as we're talking about caffeine,
[01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:04.400]   I'd like to point out a study that's really interesting.
[01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:06.880]   This was published in Journal of Neuroscience,
[01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:08.880]   which is the Society for Neurosciences
[01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:10.240]   kind of flagship journal.
[01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:11.080]   It's their journal.
[01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:12.840]   It's a good journal.
[01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:14.880]   And what they showed was that caffeine
[01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:18.060]   can increase dopamine release in the brain by about 30%.
[01:09:18.060 --> 01:09:20.980]   That wasn't surprising, I even said that earlier.
[01:09:20.980 --> 01:09:24.020]   But what they also showed is that it has
[01:09:24.020 --> 01:09:27.480]   a protective effect on dopamine neurons.
[01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:30.580]   So caffeine in some cases may not just
[01:09:30.580 --> 01:09:31.900]   increase dopamine release,
[01:09:31.900 --> 01:09:33.900]   but it might actually have a protective effect
[01:09:33.900 --> 01:09:35.500]   on dopamine neurons.
[01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:38.340]   Now that's distinctly different from some claims
[01:09:38.340 --> 01:09:42.400]   that drugs like MDMA ecstasy have been,
[01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:44.740]   it's been argued can are neurotoxic
[01:09:44.740 --> 01:09:47.240]   for things like dopamine and serotonin neurons.
[01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:48.940]   The study that was published about that
[01:09:48.940 --> 01:09:50.240]   in the journal Science,
[01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:53.820]   which is an extremely prestigious, excellent journal,
[01:09:53.820 --> 01:09:57.800]   later it was shown that it wasn't MDMA ecstasy
[01:09:57.800 --> 01:09:59.920]   that was given in that case.
[01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:01.960]   It was actually amphetamine,
[01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:04.960]   which is known to destroy dopaminergic
[01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:06.360]   and serotonergic neurons.
[01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:07.180]   So what does this mean?
[01:10:07.180 --> 01:10:09.320]   This means that low levels of caffeine may,
[01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:10.480]   at least in a few studies,
[01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:13.480]   be protective for dopamine neurons over time.
[01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:15.600]   That MDMA ecstasy,
[01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:17.460]   something that's in clinical trials right now
[01:10:17.460 --> 01:10:20.720]   for the treatment of trauma, PTSD of various kinds
[01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:24.580]   and depression, but still illegal at this point in time,
[01:10:24.580 --> 01:10:26.680]   may, although it doesn't appear yet
[01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:27.840]   from any published studies,
[01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:30.960]   destroy dopaminergic neurons, perhaps serotonergic neurons.
[01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:33.340]   So there's a real asterisk and a question mark there,
[01:10:33.340 --> 01:10:36.320]   but amphetamine and in particular methamphetamine
[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:40.140]   is very destructive for dopaminergic neurons.
[01:10:40.140 --> 01:10:43.380]   So I don't think any of us needed any additional reasons
[01:10:43.380 --> 01:10:45.380]   to avoid methamphetamine,
[01:10:45.380 --> 01:10:48.480]   this drug that creates huge increases in dopamine
[01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:51.600]   and then huge crashes from that dopamine,
[01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:53.060]   very destructive drug.
[01:10:53.060 --> 01:10:54.040]   But in addition to that,
[01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:56.400]   seems to destroy dopaminergic neurons.
[01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:59.360]   From time to time, I've talked about nicotine on here,
[01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:02.720]   not smoking because obviously smoking is bad,
[01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:06.020]   lung cancer is bad for health, et cetera.
[01:11:06.020 --> 01:11:10.080]   But nicotine, it's in supplemental form.
[01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:12.460]   I've mentioned that a very famous neuroscientist,
[01:11:12.460 --> 01:11:15.600]   Nobel prize-winning scientists choose a lot of Nicorette.
[01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:17.800]   I know other people who choose Nicorette.
[01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:20.240]   They believe in its neuroprotective effects
[01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:21.800]   for Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.
[01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:24.320]   And indeed nicotine can stimulate dopamine release.
[01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:25.720]   We talked about that earlier.
[01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:27.840]   Whether or not it has a protective effect isn't clear.
[01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:30.360]   The protective effects might be through the noradrenergic
[01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:32.200]   and acetylcholine systems.
[01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:35.400]   Those findings are still unclear,
[01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:37.000]   but it is interesting to note
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:40.680]   that nicotine can increase prolactin somewhat.
[01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:41.680]   There are a couple of studies,
[01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:43.640]   I'd be happy to link to them in the caption
[01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:45.900]   that shows that nicotine taken too much
[01:11:45.900 --> 01:11:48.720]   over too long periods of time can also increase prolactin,
[01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:51.840]   which again is the opposite side of dopamine.
[01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:55.280]   So today we've talked a lot about the dopamine system
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:57.220]   and those kinds of schedules
[01:11:57.220 --> 01:12:00.580]   that will allow craving or addiction.
[01:12:00.580 --> 01:12:03.800]   What's the schedule of dopamine that's going to allow you
[01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:06.220]   to maximize on your pursuit of pleasure
[01:12:06.220 --> 01:12:08.160]   and your elimination of pain?
[01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:10.760]   And we get the answer to that
[01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:14.120]   from our good friend gambling.
[01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:15.680]   The reason gambling works,
[01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:17.880]   the reason why people will throw their lives away,
[01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:21.660]   the reason why people go back again and again and again
[01:12:21.660 --> 01:12:24.980]   to places like Las Vegas and Atlantic City
[01:12:24.980 --> 01:12:28.060]   is because of the hope and anticipation.
[01:12:28.060 --> 01:12:31.940]   Those are cities and places built on dopamine.
[01:12:31.940 --> 01:12:34.280]   They are leveraging your dopamine system.
[01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:37.020]   And I realized that there are experienced gamblers.
[01:12:37.020 --> 01:12:38.460]   There are people that enjoy gambling.
[01:12:38.460 --> 01:12:41.740]   I'll actually just say, I like sitting at the roulette table.
[01:12:41.740 --> 01:12:43.460]   I always take a designated amount of money.
[01:12:43.460 --> 01:12:44.460]   It's not much.
[01:12:44.460 --> 01:12:46.600]   I enjoy playing a little bit of roulette.
[01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:47.920]   I certainly enjoy when I win.
[01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:49.660]   I certainly don't like it when I lose,
[01:12:49.660 --> 01:12:51.600]   but I do it surely for the pleasure of playing.
[01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:52.880]   And I do it very seldom.
[01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:55.340]   I don't have a gambling problem.
[01:12:55.340 --> 01:12:57.480]   And if I did, I'd probably tell you,
[01:12:57.480 --> 01:12:59.640]   but I don't have a gambling problem.
[01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:02.280]   Yet people throw away the entire lives on gambling.
[01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:03.380]   And as a friend of mine,
[01:13:03.380 --> 01:13:06.340]   who's a certified addiction treatment specialist tells me
[01:13:06.340 --> 01:13:09.400]   that gambling addiction is a particularly sinister
[01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:12.320]   because the next time really could be
[01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:13.780]   the thing that changes everything.
[01:13:13.780 --> 01:13:14.840]   Unlike other addictions,
[01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:16.520]   the next time really could change everything.
[01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:18.960]   And that's embedded in the mind of the gambling addict.
[01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:22.640]   And rarely does it work out in favor of the wellbeing
[01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:25.280]   of the gambling addict and their family.
[01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:28.540]   However, the intermittent reinforcement schedule
[01:13:28.540 --> 01:13:31.760]   was discovered long ago by scientific researchers.
[01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:34.400]   So this is the slot machine that every once in a while
[01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:36.320]   gives you a win to keep you playing.
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:39.960]   This is the probability of winning on the craps table
[01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:41.800]   or the roulette table or at blackjack,
[01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:44.720]   just often enough that you're willing to buy tickets,
[01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:46.260]   head out there, play again,
[01:13:46.260 --> 01:13:47.740]   go downstairs again from your room,
[01:13:47.740 --> 01:13:49.820]   even though you swore you were done for the night.
[01:13:49.820 --> 01:13:53.360]   Intermittent reinforcement is the most powerful form
[01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:56.640]   of dopamine reward schedule to keep you doing something.
[01:13:56.640 --> 01:13:57.980]   So we can export that.
[01:13:57.980 --> 01:13:59.980]   We can use it for good.
[01:13:59.980 --> 01:14:01.740]   If there's something that you're pursuing in life,
[01:14:01.740 --> 01:14:03.560]   whether or not it's an academic goal
[01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:05.860]   or a financial goal or relationship goal,
[01:14:05.860 --> 01:14:08.420]   one of the things that you can do
[01:14:08.420 --> 01:14:11.240]   to ensure that you will remain on the path to that goal
[01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:13.680]   for a very long time and that you will continue
[01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:16.000]   to exceed your previous performance,
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.960]   as well as continue to enjoy the dopamine release
[01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:21.040]   that occurs when you hit the milestones
[01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:22.800]   that you want to achieve,
[01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:27.800]   is to occasionally remove reward subjectively.
[01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:30.640]   Let's say you set out a goal of making,
[01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:31.800]   I'm going to make this quantitative
[01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:32.940]   with respect to finances
[01:14:32.940 --> 01:14:34.480]   'cause it just is an easy description,
[01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:37.400]   but this could also be in sport, this could be in school,
[01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:38.240]   this could be in music,
[01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:40.080]   could be in anything, creative endeavors.
[01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:42.340]   But let's say you set out a certain financial goal,
[01:14:42.340 --> 01:14:44.360]   or let's say you want to get a certain number of followers
[01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:46.880]   on whatever social media platform.
[01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:49.480]   As you reach each one of those goals,
[01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:51.920]   you should know now that the amount of dopamine
[01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:52.880]   is not going to peak,
[01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:55.600]   it's actually going to diminish and make you crave more.
[01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:58.240]   The key to avoiding that crash,
[01:14:58.240 --> 01:14:59.800]   but to still keep it in healthy levels
[01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:01.920]   that will allow you to continue your pursuit
[01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:05.320]   is as you are staircasing toward your goal,
[01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:07.240]   maybe that's dollars, maybe that's followers,
[01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:10.220]   maybe that's grades, maybe that's some other metric,
[01:15:10.220 --> 01:15:12.200]   it's medals or trophies.
[01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:16.880]   You actually want to blunt the reward response
[01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:19.500]   for some of those intermediate goals.
[01:15:19.500 --> 01:15:21.600]   Now I'm not telling you you shouldn't celebrate your wins,
[01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:24.120]   but I'm telling you not to celebrate all of them.
[01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:27.120]   Whereas a good friend of mine who recently,
[01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:30.080]   fortunately for him, had a great financial success,
[01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:32.960]   he asked me and somebody else, a good friend of mine
[01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:35.760]   who's very tuned into dopamine reward schedules,
[01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:37.880]   understands how they work at a really deep level.
[01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:39.720]   And he said, "I don't know what to do next."
[01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:41.800]   And we said, "Oh, well, that's simple.
[01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:43.720]   You should just give most of it away."
[01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:46.920]   And this wasn't a ploy to receive any of the money ourselves,
[01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:50.720]   this was really about reducing the impact of that reward.
[01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:52.400]   Now, hopefully giving money away
[01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:53.960]   if you already have enough of it
[01:15:53.960 --> 01:15:57.280]   would be something that was rewarding in and of itself.
[01:15:57.280 --> 01:16:00.900]   But if you're a student who's pursuing goals in university,
[01:16:00.900 --> 01:16:03.660]   or you're an athlete who's pursuing goals,
[01:16:03.660 --> 01:16:06.960]   it actually makes sense from a rational perspective
[01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:09.200]   once you understand these mechanisms
[01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:13.120]   to hit a new high point of performance,
[01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:17.480]   or to get that A+ or for you if it's an A-, et cetera,
[01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:19.880]   and to tell yourself, "Okay, that was good,"
[01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:23.020]   but to actually actively blunt the reward,
[01:16:23.020 --> 01:16:26.500]   to not go and celebrate too intensely.
[01:16:26.500 --> 01:16:27.700]   Because in doing that,
[01:16:27.700 --> 01:16:30.120]   you keep your dopamine system in check
[01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:31.780]   and you ensure that you're going to stay
[01:16:31.780 --> 01:16:33.800]   on the path of continued pursuit,
[01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:35.860]   not just for that thing, but for all things.
[01:16:35.860 --> 01:16:39.640]   Big increases in dopamine lead to big crashes in dopamine,
[01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:42.560]   and big increases in dopamine up the ante.
[01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:45.180]   They increase the extent to which
[01:16:45.180 --> 01:16:48.060]   you are willing to invest time and energy
[01:16:48.060 --> 01:16:51.180]   in order to achieve goals and rewards
[01:16:51.180 --> 01:16:52.640]   that may be out of your reach.
[01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:54.960]   You never really know if you're going to succeed.
[01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:59.020]   So to make this crystal clear, celebrate your wins,
[01:16:59.020 --> 01:17:00.720]   but don't celebrate every win.
[01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:02.220]   That's one way that you can ensure
[01:17:02.220 --> 01:17:04.920]   that you're going to continue down the path of progress.
[01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:08.040]   And I think most of the learning tools that are in schools
[01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:12.100]   are about reward, hopefully for genuine performance.
[01:17:12.100 --> 01:17:13.540]   They are about encouraging us.
[01:17:13.540 --> 01:17:15.980]   We do have to believe that we can perform well.
[01:17:15.980 --> 01:17:17.620]   One of the hallmarks of growth mindset
[01:17:17.620 --> 01:17:19.100]   is the internalization,
[01:17:19.100 --> 01:17:21.740]   that we're not getting it right yet.
[01:17:21.740 --> 01:17:23.840]   The word yet is very important.
[01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:28.580]   And also the sense that we reward our good behavior,
[01:17:28.580 --> 01:17:31.860]   our good performance, but not every time.
[01:17:31.860 --> 01:17:34.800]   One way to do this is to actually take the reward
[01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:37.660]   and reinforcement out of your own hands and your own mind.
[01:17:37.660 --> 01:17:41.280]   And you tell somebody that they are in control
[01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:42.340]   of whether or not you're allowed
[01:17:42.340 --> 01:17:43.600]   to feel good about your wins.
[01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:46.840]   Now, this is, I realize is very unnatural for most people.
[01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:50.100]   But if you're somebody who's simply going to be in pursuit
[01:17:50.100 --> 01:17:52.360]   and you're going to really register your wins,
[01:17:52.360 --> 01:17:53.780]   and you think that that's going to actually
[01:17:53.780 --> 01:17:55.140]   make you a better performer,
[01:17:55.140 --> 01:17:57.620]   it will in the short term, but not in the long term.
[01:17:57.620 --> 01:18:02.060]   So you can lift the, what Las Vegas and Atlantic City
[01:18:02.060 --> 01:18:05.660]   and other gambling mechanisms and places
[01:18:05.660 --> 01:18:06.620]   have known for a long time.
[01:18:06.620 --> 01:18:07.920]   They lifted it from the scientists.
[01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:10.980]   You can now take it back and you can start to leverage that.
[01:18:10.980 --> 01:18:12.460]   And you just make it intermittent.
[01:18:12.460 --> 01:18:15.300]   You reward yourself not on a predictable schedule.
[01:18:15.300 --> 01:18:17.620]   So not every other time or every third time
[01:18:17.620 --> 01:18:19.740]   or every 10th time, but sometimes it's three in a row,
[01:18:19.740 --> 01:18:21.820]   then not at all for 10 days.
[01:18:21.820 --> 01:18:24.420]   So reward is important.
[01:18:24.420 --> 01:18:26.340]   Self-reward is critically important,
[01:18:26.340 --> 01:18:28.340]   but make sure that you're not doing it
[01:18:28.340 --> 01:18:30.660]   on such a predictable schedule
[01:18:30.660 --> 01:18:33.580]   that you burn out these dopamine circuits
[01:18:33.580 --> 01:18:38.540]   or that you undercut your own ability to strive and achieve.
[01:18:38.540 --> 01:18:41.460]   I actually have a story from graduate school,
[01:18:41.460 --> 01:18:44.740]   which I was forced into an intermittent reinforcement
[01:18:44.740 --> 01:18:47.700]   schedule that I do believe has served me very well
[01:18:47.700 --> 01:18:50.620]   in my scientific career and other aspects of life.
[01:18:50.620 --> 01:18:53.540]   My graduate advisor was an amazing scientist.
[01:18:53.540 --> 01:18:56.420]   Unfortunately, she passed away, but amazing scientists
[01:18:56.420 --> 01:18:59.200]   and amazing human being with a very dry
[01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:01.980]   and somewhat cruel sense of humor.
[01:19:01.980 --> 01:19:03.620]   Her name was Barbara Chapman.
[01:19:03.620 --> 01:19:07.100]   And we published a paper in the journal Science.
[01:19:07.100 --> 01:19:11.100]   And Science, Nature and Cell are considered the big three,
[01:19:11.100 --> 01:19:13.740]   the most competitive journals to publish in.
[01:19:13.740 --> 01:19:15.880]   I had a first author paper in Science.
[01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:18.340]   It was really exciting to me.
[01:19:18.340 --> 01:19:19.340]   I was a graduate student.
[01:19:19.340 --> 01:19:21.240]   I was very excited about the discovery.
[01:19:21.240 --> 01:19:22.820]   I was excited that it was in Science.
[01:19:22.820 --> 01:19:24.900]   I was just thrilled.
[01:19:24.900 --> 01:19:27.200]   And I remember when the paper finally got accepted
[01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:29.260]   because it involved a ton of revisions
[01:19:29.260 --> 01:19:31.980]   and a lot of very hard work.
[01:19:31.980 --> 01:19:35.620]   And she came in and she said, paper got accepted.
[01:19:35.620 --> 01:19:36.920]   I was super excited.
[01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:38.960]   And she just kind of sat there and nodded.
[01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:41.700]   And I said, are we going to celebrate?
[01:19:41.700 --> 01:19:42.820]   Are we going to have a party?
[01:19:42.820 --> 01:19:44.400]   Or like, what are we going to do?
[01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:45.600]   And I'll never forget her answer.
[01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:50.420]   She said, "Hmm, I think we should skip this one."
[01:19:50.420 --> 01:19:51.740]   And I thought she was joking.
[01:19:51.740 --> 01:19:53.220]   And I said, "What do you mean skip this one?
[01:19:53.220 --> 01:19:54.060]   We're going to publish the paper."
[01:19:54.060 --> 01:19:55.420]   She said, "Yeah, we're going to publish the paper."
[01:19:55.420 --> 01:20:00.140]   But she said, "Maybe when you get like four more,
[01:20:00.140 --> 01:20:02.180]   maybe three, maybe two."
[01:20:02.180 --> 01:20:03.820]   And I thought she was messing with me.
[01:20:03.820 --> 01:20:05.060]   And she wasn't messing with me.
[01:20:05.060 --> 01:20:05.900]   And she was right.
[01:20:05.900 --> 01:20:06.900]   We never had a party.
[01:20:06.900 --> 01:20:09.100]   We never had a celebration for that paper.
[01:20:09.100 --> 01:20:12.380]   I think she was really trying to instill two ideas in me.
[01:20:12.380 --> 01:20:14.700]   One is that the work itself
[01:20:14.700 --> 01:20:16.560]   was what was supposed to be most rewarding.
[01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:19.440]   The practice of experimentation or writing the paper,
[01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:20.980]   the experience of achieving something
[01:20:20.980 --> 01:20:22.380]   you worked very hard at.
[01:20:22.380 --> 01:20:24.140]   And that did indeed feel amazing.
[01:20:24.140 --> 01:20:26.800]   I actually can still feel it in my body now, the excitement.
[01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:29.260]   So there's still a dopamine release
[01:20:29.260 --> 01:20:31.060]   or that arc is going very long.
[01:20:31.060 --> 01:20:35.120]   This would be almost 20 years ago now that this happened.
[01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:36.500]   So that's remarkable.
[01:20:36.500 --> 01:20:38.660]   The other one is that she's right.
[01:20:38.660 --> 01:20:40.580]   We never went out and celebrated.
[01:20:40.580 --> 01:20:42.340]   And we did celebrate other wins,
[01:20:42.340 --> 01:20:44.780]   other papers in the future and things of that sort.
[01:20:44.780 --> 01:20:48.580]   But she was either consciously or subconsciously
[01:20:48.580 --> 01:20:50.820]   putting me on an intermittent reward schedule.
[01:20:50.820 --> 01:20:54.180]   And to this day, when something really good happens,
[01:20:54.180 --> 01:20:56.500]   I actually hesitate as to whether or not
[01:20:56.500 --> 01:20:58.940]   I want to internalize that and celebrate,
[01:20:58.940 --> 01:21:00.220]   whether I want to tell anybody,
[01:21:00.220 --> 01:21:01.840]   which is its own form of celebration
[01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:03.660]   'cause then you're getting positive feedback.
[01:21:03.660 --> 01:21:08.260]   And so I am very cautious with how I deploy dopamine release
[01:21:08.260 --> 01:21:09.560]   in response to wins.
[01:21:09.560 --> 01:21:10.780]   It's certainly not the only way
[01:21:10.780 --> 01:21:12.880]   that I've navigated my career.
[01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:15.060]   There are a number of other principles I incorporate,
[01:21:15.060 --> 01:21:20.060]   but intermittent reward for wins, for achievements
[01:21:20.700 --> 01:21:22.660]   is a very powerful way to ensure
[01:21:22.660 --> 01:21:25.260]   that you will stay on the path of pursuit.
[01:21:25.260 --> 01:21:27.220]   At this point in the podcast,
[01:21:27.220 --> 01:21:30.540]   I'd like to take a moment to address some corrections.
[01:21:30.540 --> 01:21:32.540]   I made some errors in previous episodes.
[01:21:32.540 --> 01:21:33.740]   They weren't major errors,
[01:21:33.740 --> 01:21:35.700]   but a couple of you pointed them out.
[01:21:35.700 --> 01:21:38.980]   And it's important to me that we strive for accuracy.
[01:21:38.980 --> 01:21:42.300]   So the first one was I talked in a previous episode
[01:21:42.300 --> 01:21:45.940]   about the potential benefits for some people, not all,
[01:21:45.940 --> 01:21:49.740]   of ashwagandha and its role in blunting cortisol
[01:21:49.740 --> 01:21:54.160]   in a way of offsetting medium-term and some long-term stress.
[01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:56.340]   It's a supplement that I've benefited from.
[01:21:56.340 --> 01:21:59.020]   It works through the GABA system and some other systems.
[01:21:59.020 --> 01:22:00.740]   Someone pointed out a study
[01:22:00.740 --> 01:22:03.020]   that admittedly was done in rats.
[01:22:03.020 --> 01:22:05.620]   I was focusing mainly on studies in humans
[01:22:05.620 --> 01:22:06.440]   during the episode,
[01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:08.980]   but they point out a study that was done in rats
[01:22:08.980 --> 01:22:13.700]   that showed that long-term administration of ashwagandha
[01:22:13.700 --> 01:22:16.380]   could actually create some negative effects,
[01:22:16.380 --> 01:22:20.660]   mainly on the thyroid and perhaps even the cortisol system,
[01:22:20.660 --> 01:22:22.240]   maybe the melatonin system.
[01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:24.420]   I just want to acknowledge that study.
[01:22:24.420 --> 01:22:26.680]   I'll reference it in the caption.
[01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:27.900]   Again, that was a rat study.
[01:22:27.900 --> 01:22:29.200]   I was focused on human studies.
[01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:31.100]   Please go to examine.com.
[01:22:31.100 --> 01:22:33.620]   Put in ashwagandha, it will tell you the various effects
[01:22:33.620 --> 01:22:35.640]   on different aspects of brain and body.
[01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:37.500]   It will also link to the PubMed articles
[01:22:37.500 --> 01:22:38.800]   that are relevant there.
[01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:40.340]   It is called the human effect matrix
[01:22:40.340 --> 01:22:42.020]   'cause that's only focused on humans.
[01:22:42.020 --> 01:22:43.840]   That's one of the reasons I like examine.com
[01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:45.700]   is it's focused on human studies.
[01:22:45.700 --> 01:22:47.460]   Again, a wonderful free resource.
[01:22:47.460 --> 01:22:50.920]   But I do appreciate that you pointed out that study
[01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:54.220]   because I do want people to be aware of the range of effects
[01:22:54.220 --> 01:22:56.200]   that these various compounds can have.
[01:22:56.200 --> 01:22:59.860]   As well, a couple of times in previous episodes,
[01:22:59.860 --> 01:23:04.620]   I said 5-HTP and not 5-HT.
[01:23:04.620 --> 01:23:06.420]   5-HT is serotonin.
[01:23:06.420 --> 01:23:09.660]   5-HTP is a precursor to serotonin.
[01:23:09.660 --> 01:23:11.860]   I was talking about supplements and compounds
[01:23:11.860 --> 01:23:14.560]   that can stimulate the release of serotonin.
[01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:15.620]   In the previous episode,
[01:23:15.620 --> 01:23:17.580]   I was actually referring to it in a context
[01:23:17.580 --> 01:23:20.660]   for which I don't personally like to take 5-HTP.
[01:23:20.660 --> 01:23:22.660]   That's just my own bias
[01:23:22.660 --> 01:23:24.460]   for reasons I described in that episode.
[01:23:24.460 --> 01:23:27.460]   But if you heard me say 5-HTP
[01:23:27.460 --> 01:23:31.220]   when I meant to say 5-HT, I apologize.
[01:23:31.220 --> 01:23:33.280]   And then last, I just want to point out again,
[01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:34.420]   something that I mentioned in the beginning,
[01:23:34.420 --> 01:23:36.540]   which is that the Huberman Lab Podcast
[01:23:36.540 --> 01:23:38.840]   is now subtitled in Spanish.
[01:23:38.840 --> 01:23:40.060]   Episodes one and two,
[01:23:40.060 --> 01:23:41.920]   as well as our welcome video are in Spanish.
[01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:44.780]   The other ones will be subtitled soon.
[01:23:44.780 --> 01:23:47.100]   You can expect that within the next couple of weeks.
[01:23:47.100 --> 01:23:49.440]   So if you know Spanish-speaking people
[01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:52.140]   who prefer to digest the information in Spanish,
[01:23:52.140 --> 01:23:53.700]   or that's you,
[01:23:53.700 --> 01:23:56.140]   you can look forward to the Spanish subtitles.
[01:23:56.140 --> 01:23:58.060]   You need to activate those
[01:23:58.060 --> 01:24:00.300]   in the caption feature on YouTube.
[01:24:00.300 --> 01:24:03.900]   Unfortunately, we don't have Spanish dubbing over
[01:24:03.900 --> 01:24:06.020]   in the audio platforms.
[01:24:06.020 --> 01:24:09.740]   I realize once again, we've covered a lot of material.
[01:24:09.740 --> 01:24:13.140]   Hopefully you now know far more about the dopamine system,
[01:24:13.140 --> 01:24:15.180]   reward and motivation
[01:24:15.180 --> 01:24:17.820]   than you did at the beginning of this podcast.
[01:24:17.820 --> 01:24:20.540]   Hopefully you also understand the other side
[01:24:20.540 --> 01:24:21.660]   of dopamine and reward,
[01:24:21.660 --> 01:24:25.100]   which is pain and the balance of this pleasure pain system,
[01:24:25.100 --> 01:24:28.020]   as well as the molecules that we call,
[01:24:28.020 --> 01:24:30.560]   or that were described in the Molecule of More book,
[01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:32.760]   I should say, as the here and now molecules,
[01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:36.020]   things like serotonin and the endocannabinoids.
[01:24:36.020 --> 01:24:38.860]   We talked about a variety of supplement-based tools,
[01:24:38.860 --> 01:24:40.740]   things like vitamin B6 and zinc
[01:24:40.740 --> 01:24:43.300]   as they relate to prolactin, PEA,
[01:24:43.300 --> 01:24:45.320]   very interesting compound.
[01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:47.340]   Again, I've never tried it, very interesting,
[01:24:47.340 --> 01:24:48.980]   definitely in use out there.
[01:24:48.980 --> 01:24:51.020]   L-DOPA, Macuna Purines,
[01:24:51.020 --> 01:24:55.340]   talked about caffeine, talked about nicotine,
[01:24:55.340 --> 01:24:57.980]   talked about how some of the effects of Adderall
[01:24:57.980 --> 01:24:59.820]   can be created purely cognitively
[01:24:59.820 --> 01:25:01.700]   without actually ingesting Adderall,
[01:25:01.700 --> 01:25:04.100]   simply by telling people they're ingesting Adderall,
[01:25:04.100 --> 01:25:04.980]   giving them caffeine.
[01:25:04.980 --> 01:25:06.740]   Very interesting study
[01:25:06.740 --> 01:25:08.860]   that I referenced a little bit earlier.
[01:25:08.860 --> 01:25:12.220]   And we talked about scheduling dopamine,
[01:25:12.220 --> 01:25:16.260]   adopting the intermittent reward schedule for yourself
[01:25:16.260 --> 01:25:19.080]   in order to ensure long-term engagement
[01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:21.820]   with pursuits that I hope are healthy pursuits
[01:25:21.820 --> 01:25:24.260]   and ones that serve you well.
[01:25:24.260 --> 01:25:27.260]   This was by no means an exhaustive coverage
[01:25:27.260 --> 01:25:29.960]   of all things dopamine and motivation.
[01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:32.140]   It was by no means the only time
[01:25:32.140 --> 01:25:35.120]   that we're going to talk about dopamine and motivation.
[01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:37.500]   Next episode, we're going to continue to talk about emotions
[01:25:37.500 --> 01:25:40.100]   from yet another perspective.
[01:25:40.100 --> 01:25:42.460]   But hopefully you have enough now to think about
[01:25:42.460 --> 01:25:45.700]   in the meantime, and that you can consider adopting
[01:25:45.700 --> 01:25:47.420]   in your own life and practices.
[01:25:47.420 --> 01:25:49.940]   As always, I really want to thank you
[01:25:49.940 --> 01:25:51.440]   for your time and attention.
[01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:53.180]   If you've learned something useful today,
[01:25:53.180 --> 01:25:54.560]   please pass it along.
[01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:56.660]   One of the things that we teach in science
[01:25:56.660 --> 01:25:59.520]   that I think is really wonderful to adopt in general in life
[01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:02.940]   is this idea of watch one, do one, teach one.
[01:26:02.940 --> 01:26:04.460]   This is what we tell graduate students
[01:26:04.460 --> 01:26:06.380]   and med students and postdocs.
[01:26:06.380 --> 01:26:08.520]   Watch somebody do something, learn it,
[01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:11.060]   then do it, apply it, see if it works for you,
[01:26:11.060 --> 01:26:12.280]   and then teach it.
[01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:14.340]   So it's usually not watch one, do one, teach one.
[01:26:14.340 --> 01:26:17.480]   It's usually watch one, do 20,
[01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:20.860]   teach as many people as you possibly want.
[01:26:20.860 --> 01:26:22.140]   I'm not looking for attribution.
[01:26:22.140 --> 01:26:24.420]   These are tools that are grounded in neuroscience
[01:26:24.420 --> 01:26:26.300]   for which I can't claim attribution.
[01:26:26.300 --> 01:26:28.900]   I'm just passing them along so that you can adopt them
[01:26:28.900 --> 01:26:30.900]   if you like and pass them along
[01:26:30.900 --> 01:26:33.160]   if you think people can benefit from them.
[01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:34.780]   Many of you have continued to ask
[01:26:34.780 --> 01:26:37.660]   how you can help support the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[01:26:37.660 --> 01:26:38.860]   If you like what we're doing here
[01:26:38.860 --> 01:26:41.000]   and you like the information that we're sharing,
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.260]   please click subscribe on the YouTube channel.
[01:26:43.260 --> 01:26:44.740]   That really helps us.
[01:26:44.740 --> 01:26:48.020]   As well, if you want to hit the notifications button,
[01:26:48.020 --> 01:26:49.620]   that will allow you to make sure
[01:26:49.620 --> 01:26:51.140]   you don't miss any episodes.
[01:26:51.140 --> 01:26:53.980]   Typically, we release episodes every Monday,
[01:26:53.980 --> 01:26:56.140]   but in the future, we may release episodes
[01:26:56.140 --> 01:26:59.140]   as well as short clips more often than that.
[01:26:59.140 --> 01:27:02.660]   As well, if you want to subscribe on Apple or Spotify
[01:27:02.660 --> 01:27:05.060]   or both, that's a great help to us.
[01:27:05.060 --> 01:27:06.880]   And on Apple, you have the opportunity
[01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:09.280]   to leave us up to a five-star review.
[01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:11.580]   We do use the comment section here on YouTube
[01:27:11.580 --> 01:27:14.740]   to inform future content and to address any questions
[01:27:14.740 --> 01:27:17.740]   and clear up any miscommunications or misconceptions
[01:27:17.740 --> 01:27:18.940]   that might arise.
[01:27:18.940 --> 01:27:21.380]   So please put your questions, your comments,
[01:27:21.380 --> 01:27:23.140]   and your suggestions for future content
[01:27:23.140 --> 01:27:25.120]   in the comment section below.
[01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:27.540]   The other way to support us is to check out our sponsors
[01:27:27.540 --> 01:27:29.900]   that were mentioned at the beginning of the podcast.
[01:27:29.900 --> 01:27:32.680]   The links to those sponsors are in the captions.
[01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:34.940]   As well, we've set up a Patreon account,
[01:27:34.940 --> 01:27:38.060]   which is patreon.com/andrewhuberman
[01:27:38.060 --> 01:27:40.220]   that allows you to support the podcast
[01:27:40.220 --> 01:27:42.320]   at any level that you like.
[01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:44.460]   As well, because we mentioned supplements
[01:27:44.460 --> 01:27:46.580]   from time to time throughout the podcast,
[01:27:46.580 --> 01:27:49.500]   and people always ask about what brands and sources
[01:27:49.500 --> 01:27:52.120]   we use or suggest for those supplements,
[01:27:52.120 --> 01:27:55.820]   we partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E.
[01:27:55.820 --> 01:27:57.820]   Thorne supplements are known to be
[01:27:57.820 --> 01:28:00.560]   among the most stringent supplements in terms of
[01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:02.460]   the specificity of what's in the bottle,
[01:28:02.460 --> 01:28:03.760]   matches what's on the label,
[01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:07.140]   the quality of the ingredients is exceedingly high.
[01:28:07.140 --> 01:28:09.980]   The Mayo Clinic and all the major sports organizations
[01:28:09.980 --> 01:28:13.060]   are partnered with Thorne because of that stringency
[01:28:13.060 --> 01:28:15.140]   and that commitment to rigor.
[01:28:15.140 --> 01:28:18.300]   If you'd like to see the supplements that I personally take,
[01:28:18.300 --> 01:28:20.680]   as well as get 20% off any of the supplements
[01:28:20.680 --> 01:28:25.120]   that Thorne makes, you can go to thorne.com/u,
[01:28:25.120 --> 01:28:27.780]   that's the letter U, slash Huberman,
[01:28:27.780 --> 01:28:30.280]   and you can see what I take and any of those supplements,
[01:28:30.280 --> 01:28:33.580]   as well as any of the other products on the Thorne site
[01:28:33.580 --> 01:28:35.980]   will be available to you at 20% off.
[01:28:35.980 --> 01:28:40.980]   That's thorne.com/u/huberman to get 20% off
[01:28:40.980 --> 01:28:43.600]   any of the supplements that Thorne makes.
[01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:44.800]   Finally, I want to thank you
[01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:46.480]   for your time and attention today.
[01:28:46.480 --> 01:28:48.840]   I hope you learned a lot and that you learned
[01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:51.440]   a lot of possible tools that you could incorporate
[01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:55.660]   into your life as it relates to motivation and emotions.
[01:28:55.660 --> 01:28:57.520]   Thank you for your interest in science.
[01:28:57.520 --> 01:29:00.100]   [upbeat music]
[01:29:00.100 --> 01:29:02.680]   (upbeat music)
