[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   We apologise for the poor quality during the early part of this recording.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.400]   It was caused, unfortunately, by a fault on the original master tape.
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.680]   Here's Dr Lloyd-Jones.
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.720]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:22.480]   in the Gospel according to Saint John in the second chapter, verses 18 to 22.
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:28.320]   But in order to make the context clearer, I'm going to start reading at verse 13.
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.800]   In the second chapter of the Gospel according to Saint John.
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.720]   And the Jews' Passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:45.360]   and found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting.
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.840]   And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple,
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.760]   and the sheep and the oxen, and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables,
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.560]   and said unto them that sold doves, "Take these things hence.
[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.600]   Make not my father's house an house of merchandise."
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:14.560]   And his disciples remembered that it was written, "The zeal of thine house has eaten me up."
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.560]   Now it's from here on I want to call your attention to the message this morning.
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.080]   Then answered the Jews and said unto him, "What sign showest thou unto us,
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.880]   seeing that thou doest these things?" Jesus answered and said unto them,
[00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.360]   "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up."
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.960]   Then said the Jews, "Forty and six years was this temple in building,
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:48.160]   and wilt thou rear it up in three days?" But he spake of the temple of his body.
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:55.280]   When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.720]   them, and they believed the scripture and the word which Jesus had said.
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:09.760]   Now we are dealing with this incident which comes here, you see, as a sequel to that act of our
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:18.160]   Lord in which he cleansed the temple, driving out the money changers, and the sheep, and the oxen,
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:26.880]   and the doves, etc. And those who worship here regularly will recall how we are working our way
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.240]   slowly through this second chapter of this gospel according to Saint John. We've dealt with the
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:39.280]   incident of the turning of the water into wine at the marriage feast at Cana in Galilee, and we have
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:46.320]   also been considering that significant action of the Lord here at the very beginning of his ministry
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:53.520]   in which entering into the temple and seeing how people were misusing it and abusing it,
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:03:00.320]   turning it into merchandise, making money out of the temple and the worship of God, and so on.
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:11.040]   How he turns out all this in a miraculous manner. And we are told at the end that his disciples
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:17.360]   remembered that it was written, "The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up." Now then,
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.440]   we are now going to look at what followed that, the sequel to that incident.
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:30.400]   Here, of course, we are looking at the first real clash which took place between our Lord
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:37.520]   and the leaders and the guides in a religious sense of the Jewish nation.
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:46.160]   He had acted so far, and they had been passive, but now they begin to speak. And as you know,
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:52.640]   or are familiar with your scriptures, so much space and time is taken up in the gospels in
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:59.040]   just giving us these accounts of these arguments and disputations that took place between our
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:06.320]   blessed Lord and the Pharisees and scribes and others. This, therefore, is obviously,
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:12.320]   and from every standpoint, a most important incident for us to consider together. It is
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:18.000]   a most significant one, and I want to try to show you that it has a very urgent lesson to give to
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.720]   the Church of God at this present time. Now, let's be clear about the setting,
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:32.720]   the context of what took place. Here we are given an account of the reaction of the Jewish leaders
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.920]   to what our Lord had already done. Undoubtedly, these are some of the same people whom he turned
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:43.680]   out. They had come back again. They had observed the way in which, entering into the temple and
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:51.200]   looking round, he had made this scourge of small cars and had proceeded to drive out
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:57.040]   these animals and these people. And they turn to him, and this is what they say.
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.560]   They say, "What sign showest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?"
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:09.040]   Which, being interpreted, of course, means this. They say, "Now look here. You are claiming that
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:15.520]   you have authority to do this. You come here to the temple, and you are not one of the priests,
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:22.160]   but you don't hesitate to take upon yourself the authority to do what you've just done.
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:27.680]   You are claiming that you are the Lord and the Master of the temple. Now, they say,
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:34.000]   if you are making such a claim, well, then you must substantiate it, and you must give us some
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.400]   proof of your authority and your right to do this. They say that if you are making this claim,
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:46.560]   that you have a right to do what you've just done in the temple of the living God, well, then give
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:53.440]   us some tangible, visible demonstration of the fact that you are entitled to do this. You're
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:06:00.800]   arrogating to yourself very great powers. You're making a tremendous claim. What sign are you
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:07.360]   going to give us to prove to us that you really have the right to do this?" Now, they use this
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:15.680]   word "sign." What sign showest thou unto us? You see, they're asking for something striking,
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:23.040]   some portent, something unusual, something that we can see, they say. We ask of you to give us
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:28.640]   this sign. If we are going to listen to you and to be guided by you, well, then you must give us some
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:37.440]   absolute proof of your authority and your right to act in this manner. And then our Lord deals
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:43.440]   with their request. Now, you notice the way in which he does that. This is so typical of what
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:50.800]   he went on doing. He starts his ministry here, in a way, and you see, he lays down the principles
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:56.720]   on which he always acts. He doesn't answer them directly. He answers them indirectly.
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:02.480]   They say, "What sign showest thou?" Jesus answered and said unto them, "Destroy this temple,
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:11.200]   and in three days I will raise it up." They don't understand this. And they don't understand
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:16.240]   because it's indirect speech. There's a hidden meaning there, which they've missed altogether,
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:21.440]   as I'm going to show you. Therefore, the two points I want to note here is just this, that
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:30.160]   our Lord's reply is an indirect answer, and it is a prophecy of his own coming resurrection.
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:36.240]   John makes that perfectly clear to us. He spake of the temple of his body. When, therefore,
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:41.040]   he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them,
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:45.440]   and they believed the scripture and the word which Jesus had said.
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:51.840]   Now, there are the facts. There's the setting for us. But now the thing that's before us is this.
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:59.280]   Why did this ever happen? What's the meaning of this? What is the significance to us of what our
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:05.920]   Lord did and said on this occasion? The first answer, of course, is that it had a very special
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:12.880]   significance for the Jews at that time, the Jewish nation and their religious teachers and leaders.
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:20.960]   He is telling them something about themselves. He is, indeed, condemning them again.
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:28.480]   He's doing in words what he's already done in action. He is showing the position at which
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:37.520]   they've arrived in their relationship to God. But what I'm concerned about is that we should
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:45.600]   see the significance of this to us today. All scripture is given to us for our profit.
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:50.880]   These things were written for our examples upon whom the ends of the world have come.
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:56.480]   Very well, it had its immediate local significance, but it has its larger significance.
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:05.040]   Our Lord is here really giving us his teaching concerning this whole matter of silence.
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:13.200]   They lead him to do that, of course, by demanding a sign of him. And our Lord deals with their
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:20.400]   question. They've raised the whole question of silence. And our Lord answers the question.
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:25.600]   Now, how is this significant to us? Well, it's significant to us in this way.
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:32.880]   We are told here why it is that many people are never truly blessed by the Lord.
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:39.200]   They're facing him in exactly the same way as everybody else. They're facing the same
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:45.600]   gracious invitations and offers of the gospel, but they never receive them. And here we are
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:51.280]   given one of the reasons and the explanations why some people are never really blessed.
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:56.880]   Now, remember, we are dealing here with religious people. These were religious people,
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:04.240]   but they missed the blessing. And we are given the reason and the explanation of that.
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:10.240]   That is where I say it becomes significant to us today. Now, let me remind you again that what we
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:16.720]   are doing in these studies of this gospel is we are concentrating on this great theme of the
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:24.160]   gospel of John, which is, as is stated in the 16th verse of the first chapter, "of his fullness of
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:31.600]   all we received and grace upon grace. He came that we might have that fullness. I am come that they
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:36.720]   might have life and that they might have it more abundantly." Now, here's the question. Why is it
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:42.560]   that some people never receive of that fullness? Why is it that some people never know anything
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:49.680]   about this life which is more abundant? I'm suggesting to you that here in this incident
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:55.280]   we are given one of the answers that is inherent to that question, and it is a most important
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:11:02.000]   and the most urgent one. We've already seen certain answers to that question already in the
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:08.720]   incident of the marriage feast at Cana of Galilee. Here the theme is taken forward.
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:18.640]   Now, obviously this is a subtle matter. It's not easy. There's a problem involved here.
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:26.080]   Nevertheless, it is a very vital one, and it's a very vital one for this reason, that many people
[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:32.400]   have gone astray at this point. Many people have gone astray over this whole question of silence
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:41.440]   and the desire for silence. I say that this has happened many times. I would say that that was
[00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:47.040]   partly the trouble with the church at Corinth. The problem with which the apostle has to deal
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:53.120]   in the church is largely this very matter of a wrong attitude towards silence.
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:12:00.320]   And the subsequent history of the church many, many times gives us illustrations
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:07.440]   concerning this very self-same thing. And the remarkable thing is this, and this is what makes
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:13.760]   it in a sense difficult for us. People have often started in the right way and then gone wrong.
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:18.800]   The fact that you start in the right way doesn't mean that you're guaranteed to continue in the
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:25.760]   right way. The devil is always there, and the devil is always waiting to confuse us and to muddle us.
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:32.160]   He wants to destroy God's work. He can turn himself into an angel of light. He can produce
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:38.560]   counterfeits, and thus he muddles God's people. And the fact that a man is right at the beginning
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:43.520]   doesn't mean, I say, that he will continue to be right. The devil in a very subtle way can come
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:48.800]   and insinuate his own thinking, and what starts as right can end by being terribly wrong.
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:56.320]   The church of Corinth was the church of God at Corinth, and they're all described as saints,
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:01.120]   yet they've got into a state of confusion. And as I say, there are many, many illustrations
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:05.120]   and examples of this in the subsequent history of the Christian church.
[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:13.520]   So that it behoves us to consider this teaching very closely and very carefully. It's not easy,
[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:19.200]   I say. There is an element of subtlety here, but we must look at it together. Now, because of the
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:24.320]   importance of this subject, you will find that there is a good deal of attention paid to it
[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:31.280]   in the pages of the New Testament. For instance, you get the same thing coming in the sixth chapter
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:37.360]   of this Gospel according to St. John, in verse 30, where he's still dealing really with the same
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:44.160]   people. Our Lord had performed the miracle of feeding the five thousand and so on, and then
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:52.720]   the people follow him. And here we are told, "They said therefore unto him, What sign showest thou
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:59.600]   then that we may see and believe thee?" What dost thou work? See, this was the thing they kept on
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:05.040]   asking him. He worked miracles before them, he did wonderful things out of this incomparable
[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:10.800]   teaching, but they keep on bringing out this same question. "What sign showest thou then that we may
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:16.480]   see and believe thee?" What dost thou work? Our fathers did eat manna in the desert, as it is
[00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:24.560]   written. He gave them bread from heaven to eat. Then Jesus said unto them, "Verily, verily, I say
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:30.560]   unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven, but my Father giveth you the true bread
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:34.960]   from heaven. For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth light unto
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:41.440]   the world." You see again, the indirect answer, the reference to something concerning himself
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:45.680]   which they entirely fail to grasp. It's another illustration of the same thing.
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:50.880]   And then, I read to you at the beginning that portion from the twelfth chapter of Matthew's
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:56.000]   Gospel, which is in a sense the most extended treatment of this whole matter, and which is
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.200]   the best exposition you'll ever find of the verses that we are looking at together at this moment.
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:06.480]   But then, let me give you one other illustration. In the sixteenth chapter of the Gospel according
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:12.640]   to Matthew, you find this at the very beginning. "The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came,"
[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:18.880]   and remember, Pharisees and Sadducees were bitter enemies. They disagreed, they quarreled,
[00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:24.880]   and they were at enmity with one another. "But the Pharisees also with the Sadducees came,
[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:32.720]   and tempting him, desired him that he would show them a sign from him." Same thing. "He answered
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:38.000]   and said unto them, When it is evening, you say, it will be fair weather, for the sky is red;
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:44.560]   and in the morning it will be foul weather to-day, for the sky is red and lowering. O ye hypocrites,
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:51.280]   ye can discern the face of the sky, but can ye not discern the signs of the times?
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:16:00.080]   A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign, and there shall no sign be given unto it,
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:07.040]   but the sign of the prophet Jonas." Here it is. And I do suggest to you, you'll find the same
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:11.440]   thing in the eleventh chapter of the Gospel according to St. Luke, where the parallel
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:18.400]   account is given of this same incident. And I always have a feeling that the story of
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:26.960]   Divies and Lazarus is really something that deals with exactly the same theme, especially what our
[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:36.800]   Lord says at the very end, you remember. Abraham speaking to Divies. Divies asks that they would
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:40.960]   send someone to speak to his brethren. "I pray thee therefore, Father, that thou wouldst send
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:45.520]   him to my father's house; for I have five brethren, that he may testify unto them,
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:50.880]   lest they also come into this place of torment. Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the
[00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:56.320]   prophets; let them hear them. And he said, Nay, Father Abraham; but if one went unto them from
[00:16:56.320 --> 00:17:03.360]   the dead, they will repent. He giveth them this spectacular sign; then they'll repent and believe.
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:09.280]   And he said unto them, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded,
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:16.240]   though one rose from the dead." Same thing, same thing exactly. You see therefore, the prominence
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:20.880]   that is given to this whole theme in the teaching of the New Testament. Now then, let me try to
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:26.640]   summarize the message for you this morning. Obviously there is a problem in connection
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:32.640]   with this whole matter of the giving of signs and the demand for signs. What do I mean? Well,
[00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:39.840]   I mean this. Our Lord worked miracles in order to give signs. You remember how the account of
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:44.880]   the miracle of the turning of the water into wine ends in this second chapter of John's Gospel,
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:51.120]   in verse 11. "This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:56.560]   his glory." Now, "miracles" there should be translated "signs". John always uses the word
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:04.560]   "signs". "This beginning of signs did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory,
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:13.840]   and his disciples believed in him." He deliberately gave them signs in order to attest his own person,
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:23.440]   and in order to encourage their belief. Yet at the same time, he condemns this request for signs.
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:30.720]   And that is where the problem arises. He gives them, and yet when they ask for them,
[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:38.400]   he won't give them. Now, you see, I say it's subtle, I say it is vital. And my dear friends,
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:43.200]   you and I have got to understand this. This is where the whole difficulty comes in, this is where
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:49.600]   the devil comes in. As you see him acting through these Jewish leaders and through others. Now,
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:57.840]   how do we reconcile these two positions? That he freely gives signs, and yet resents and condemns
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:03.760]   the request for signs. Well, it seems to me the best way to approach it is something like this.
[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:12.240]   It's quite clear from this one chapter alone, that there are two main attitudes towards signs.
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:19.440]   "Our Lord always causes division." He said that. He said, "Think not that I am come
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:28.080]   to send peace on earth. I came not to send peace, but a sword." He divides between the father,
[00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:33.360]   and the children, and the mother, and the daughter, and the daughter-in-law, and so on.
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:40.400]   Everything he does, he himself, his speech, his actions, always causes division. You can't help
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:45.760]   that. You react, everybody must react to him. And there are only two main ways in which we can
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:52.880]   react. And remember, our reaction to him and what he does, proclaims what we are. And you see all
[00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:58.560]   that, I say, quite clearly in this chapter. Now, here he is, he gives the signs, and you notice how
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:06.320]   the disciples react to them. His disciples believed in him. And again, that was at Cairn of Galilee.
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:11.760]   Then when he turns out these people, out of the temple, the disciples reacted like this.
[00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:19.440]   The disciples remembered that it was written, "The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up."
[00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:26.320]   That's how they reacted to the cleansing of the temple. But here, the Jews, the leaders of the
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:32.480]   Jews, reacted in an entirely different manner. They are puzzled, they are unconvinced,
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:40.080]   and that leads them to make this request for a sign. Now, isn't this extraordinary? They're
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:45.280]   looking at the same person, they're observing the same actions, and yet the response and the reaction
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:51.040]   are entirely different. He always does this, he's doing it at this present time. Let's be careful,
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:57.440]   my friends. Let's be careful in our speech, especially. What we say proclaims what we are.
[00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:02.560]   Quite unconsciously, we condemn ourselves so frequently. Well, now then, here are the two
[00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:10.320]   possible reactions. But our Lord, I say, condemns the second. They turn to him and they say, "What
[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:16.320]   sign showest thou unto us? Why don't you do something visible, obvious, tangible, that will
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:21.600]   give us absolute proof, and then we'll be able to believe in you and in your authority." Now then,
[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:31.040]   our Lord condemns that. He condemns it here by implication. He doesn't give them a sign,
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:38.320]   he gives them this indirect answer, this talk concerning himself, his body and the temple,
[00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:45.280]   and so on, and the forecasting of the resurrection. Here, it is implicit, but it's all here.
[00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:54.960]   And then he puts it quite plainly and explicitly elsewhere. He doesn't hesitate to condemn this
[00:21:54.960 --> 00:22:01.920]   demand for a sign. He says, "An evil and an adulterous generation seeketh after sign."
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:06.640]   Now, let's be clear about what we are doing.
[00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:11.680]   And this is where, I say again, the subtlety comes in.
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:19.760]   I suggest to you that you must draw a distinction between this request from the Jewish leaders
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:26.880]   and the request that his mother had made to him in Cana of Galilee. You remember there we are told,
[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:33.360]   "When they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, 'They have no wine.'" And she was
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:39.280]   rebuked, you remember. But she wasn't rebuked for the same reason as these people. Why not? Well,
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:47.760]   Mary was not asking for a sign. Mary was asking that he would relieve the situation and the need.
[00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:53.200]   Of course, she knew that that involved a miracle, but she wasn't asking for a miracle merely to have
[00:22:53.200 --> 00:23:01.360]   a miracle. She was asking for an act of compassion and of mercy and of blessing involving a miracle.
[00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:08.320]   So while she is rebuked for trying to dictate to him, she is not rebuked in the way that these
[00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:14.400]   Jewish leaders are here on this occasion. And I must put into the same category,
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:20.400]   and this is where we must be careful in our distinctions. I will put into exactly the same
[00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:28.400]   category John the Baptist. You remember what we are told about John. You'll get the record in the
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:34.240]   eleventh chapter of Matthew's Gospel at the beginning. John sent two of his disciples
[00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:40.480]   unto our Lord. Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his
[00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:49.520]   disciples and said unto him, "Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another?" Poor
[00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:56.160]   John, he was in prison. He was an ill man. And there I think he had become somewhat confused.
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:24:02.880]   He had already borne his great testimony to our Lord, but he can't understand this delay. He can't
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:08.640]   understand why our Lord is keeping mainly up to Galilee and spending his time amongst the poor
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:14.080]   people. Why doesn't he come down to Jerusalem and declare himself and so on? He gets the same
[00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:19.760]   indirect answer. "Jesus answered and said unto them, 'Go and show John again those things which
[00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:24.560]   ye do see and hear. The blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed,
[00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:28.880]   and the deaf hear. The dead are raised up, and the poor of the gospel preached unto them,
[00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:36.880]   and blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me.'" Now John, you see, is in trouble. John,
[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:44.000]   in a sense, is also asking for a sign, but not in the same spirit as these Jews. I'm emphasizing
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:49.440]   this for this reason. The mere fact, my dear friends, that you and I may be true Christian
[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:57.200]   people does not guarantee that all our requests are always right. It is possible, even for a
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:06.160]   Christian, to demand signs in the wrong way. There is a right way, there is a wrong way.
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:12.960]   And that is why all this matter is of such great importance for us. Now then,
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:19.600]   let us see why it is that our Lord refuses this request. Why does he condemn it?
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:26.640]   Here are his words, "An evil and an adulterous generation
[00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:34.000]   seeketh after a sign." In other words, he describes the mentality
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:42.320]   that asks for signs in the wrong way. What is the description? Well, let's take his words,
[00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:49.360]   "an evil generation." What does this word "evil" mean here? Well, it means this, you see. It means
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:26:00.800]   an attitude which is entirely wrong, an attitude which is antagonistic. It means a state of the
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:09.680]   whole soul which is in a wrong, ultimate relationship to God, evil, as distinct from
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:17.280]   holy. And this is always something which is characteristic of evil. I'll show you this
[00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:23.120]   in greater detail in a moment. Another way in which we see the evil nature of this mentality,
[00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:31.280]   this outlook, is that it always fails to see and to understand the signs that are given.
[00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:36.080]   Now that's the terrible thing about this whole attitude. Look at these men here.
[00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:43.040]   "Our Lord works a miracle in their presence." I mean by that the way he drove out these people
[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:49.520]   with nothing but a scourge of small corns. Now that was a miracle. There was no question about
[00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:54.880]   this. Our Lord in and of himself couldn't do this. He's apparently just Jesus of Nazareth,
[00:26:54.880 --> 00:27:00.800]   the carpenter. And yet, they sense something which makes them go out. In other words,
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:06.640]   it was a miracle. But you see, these people don't say that. He's just worked a miracle, they say.
[00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:12.560]   "Why don't you work some striking, tremendous miracle? Then we'll accept you and believe in you."
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:20.000]   Now that, I say, is always the essence of the difficulty. Or did you notice what we read at
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:25.520]   the beginning from the twelfth chapter of the Gospel according to St. Matthew? "Our Lord
[00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:33.040]   had just exorcised a dumb spirit or devil out of a poor devil-possessed person. He'd worked a
[00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:42.240]   miracle before their eyes." And still, they go on asking for signs. They can't see the spiritual,
[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:47.440]   they can't accept, they can't comprehend the very thing that is before their eyes.
[00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:54.480]   But they're always asking for something special, dramatic, spectacular, unusual, because of their
[00:27:54.480 --> 00:28:01.920]   utter failure to see and to comprehend that which is before their very eyes. That's a part of this
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:12.080]   evil nature. Or let me put it to you in still another form. It really means a lack of spiritual
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:20.560]   understanding. That's always the ultimate trouble. People who ask for signs in this wrong way
[00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:26.640]   are always betraying a lack of true spiritual understanding.
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:32.720]   Now look at this here, for instance. "Our Lord answers them. He says, 'Destroy this temple,
[00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:38.640]   and in three days I will raise it up.'" They completely missed it. Listen to them,
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:43.840]   so typical. "Then said the Jews, 'Forty and six years was this temple in building,
[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:47.760]   we'll now rear it up in three days.'" It's the thing they always kept on doing with them.
[00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:53.200]   They materialize everything. They never see things spiritually. They have never got a
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:29:00.240]   spiritual understanding. The whole characteristic of this outlook which is evil is that it's always
[00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:08.640]   interested in the visible, the tangible, the physical, the material, because of its lack
[00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:14.480]   of a spiritual insight, a spiritual perception, a spiritual understanding.
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:22.400]   Now, you get this same thing exactly coming out almost everywhere when our Lord utters a parable.
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:30.640]   Every time he speaks a parable, these Pharisees and scribes never see the point. They always
[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:36.000]   materialize it. Now, in the next chapter we shall be coming on to deal with that great man Nicodemus.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:41.520]   You see, he did exactly the same thing. "Our Lord said to Nicodemus, 'Except a man be born again,
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:47.280]   he cannot see the kingdom of God.'" Out comes Nicodemus. How can a man be born when he's old?
[00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:53.440]   Can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born? You see, completely missing
[00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:59.760]   the point, missing the spiritual point. He thinks of it in material terms, in physical terms.
[00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:06.800]   Our Lord has to tell him, "Look here, I'm talking about spiritual things, not things that belong to
[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:12.400]   the flesh." But this is the characteristic of this attitude. And the Apostle Paul has summed it up
[00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:18.720]   for us once and forever in 1 Corinthians 2.14, "The natural man receiveth not the things of the
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:23.920]   Spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him; neither can he know them, because they are
[00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:33.120]   spiritually discerned." And these people, this evil generation, it lacks in a spiritual understanding
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:38.560]   and apprehension. Therefore, it craves for the visible and what it calls the tangible.
[00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:44.000]   It is an evil generation. But notice the second term.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:50.560]   Have you ever been caught by this second term? How have you interpreted it?
[00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:57.680]   "An evil and an adulterous generation seeketh for a sign."
[00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:03.360]   Now, this is a most significant term, "adulterous generation."
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:07.920]   That is our Lord's ultimate condemnation of the Jewish nation.
[00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:16.000]   The prophets had often used the same language, the same imagery. Israel as a nation is compared
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:22.320]   to an adulterous wife. She is the wife of Jehovah, but she is an adulterous wife.
[00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:30.000]   And our Lord says that this generation, this kind of person or of mentality that is always seeking
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:38.320]   signs and portents, is guilty of this adulterous condition. What does it mean? Well, it means,
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:46.800]   not content with God and his ways, not content with the husband. That is what turns a woman
[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:54.480]   into an adulteress. Not content, not satisfied with her husband any longer, and beginning to
[00:31:54.480 --> 00:32:00.000]   turn away from him. This is our Lord's own description of the mentality and the spirit that
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:07.520]   craves for signs. It is an evil and an adulterous generation. It means another thing. You see,
[00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:14.880]   these are the characteristics, ruled by curiosity, beginning to look at others and in directions that
[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:18.880]   they should not. The children of Israel were always doing it. They were God's people,
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:23.200]   and he gave them his laws, and he led them along. But they were always looking at the
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:27.600]   other nations and their gods, and that always seemed to be much better than what they had got.
[00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:34.960]   That is adultery, you see. You begin to look at others, other men. That is the adulterous woman.
[00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:40.480]   She does not keep her eyes fixed upon the Lord and his commandments and his ways. She begins to
[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:47.520]   be moved by this evil curiosity, which being interpreted in this matter of signs means this,
[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:51.760]   that they tend to become interested in signs in and of themselves.
[00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:59.600]   They are interested in the spectacular, in phenomena, in and of themselves, apart from
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:04.880]   their true purpose. He does these things, yes, but if you isolate them and separate
[00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:09.200]   them from him and begin to get enraptured by them, you have already become adulterous.
[00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:18.000]   How subtle this matter is. Another characteristic of this adulterous mentality is
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:25.280]   that, of course, it is always guilty of lusting. It is a love of sensation,
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:32.560]   a love of excitement, a love of something new. That is the characteristic of the adulterous
[00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:38.880]   person, whether male or female, is it not? "Oh, it is too tame, this. Something fresh,
[00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:46.800]   something new, something exciting, out for the sensation." This is our Lord's own description.
[00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:53.360]   Of a generation of people that are seeking always after signs. And ultimately, of course,
[00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:58.320]   it comes to this, that animated by such a spirit and moved and controlled by it,
[00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:04.480]   such a person eventually takes the whole position into his or her own hands and decides what to do.
[00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:13.040]   Can't be bothered any longer, becomes impatient and takes action, takes charge of the situation
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:18.480]   and makes its demands and says, "What I desire, I must have." That's the spirit of adultery.
[00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:28.720]   It is the spirit which we can describe in these terms. It's got a craving and the craving must
[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:35.120]   be satisfied, whatever happens. It involves unfaithfulness, it involves breaking of vows,
[00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:41.040]   it involves departing from the ordained way, it doesn't matter. "I must have it." That's the
[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:51.600]   adulterous spirit. That is how our Lord, you see, describes the generation of people,
[00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:57.040]   the outlook and the mentality of those who are forever seeking after signs.
[00:34:57.040 --> 00:35:03.920]   Well then, the next point is this. He always refuses to grant such signs. He'll never do that.
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:12.320]   He will never answer that kind of request. And if you think he's answered such a request from you,
[00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:15.600]   you're wrong. There is one who can counterfeit his actions.
[00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:23.360]   He never granted such a request. He doesn't do it here, he doesn't do it in all the other
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:27.280]   incidents I have given to you. But let me give you perhaps what is the greatest example of all.
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:32.320]   The devil put the same request to him in the temptations in the wilderness.
[00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:40.720]   "If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be turned into bread. Give me a sign."
[00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:48.720]   Our Lord doesn't do it. He refuses completely, answers him again indirectly. The same
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:53.600]   with the proposition for him to throw himself from the pinnacle of the temple,
[00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:58.240]   again the dramatic thing. "Give this sign, then everybody will believe in you." He won't do it.
[00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:08.160]   He never did. You see, the father of all such requests, leading to this evil and adulterous
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:15.520]   state and condition, the father of it all is always the devil. And our Lord doesn't grant
[00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:21.360]   such a request. You know, you find the same thing in his handling at the end of his life of King
[00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:28.640]   Herod. You remember how Pilate sent our Lord to Herod. He heard the mention of the name Herod.
[00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:33.360]   He thought, "Here it is. This is what I'll do. I'll send him to Herod." Herod and Pilate were
[00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:37.840]   enemies. They quarreled violently. They didn't speak to one another. But now, you see, they
[00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:44.400]   joined together against him. And I read in Luke 23, 8 and 9, "When Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly
[00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:50.000]   glad, for he was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him,
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:56.320]   and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him. Then he questioned with him in many words,
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:07.360]   but he answered him nothing." He doesn't answer such a man. Not only does he not
[00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:13.840]   work a miracle before him, he doesn't answer him. And again in his trial, in the presence of Pilate
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:19.760]   and the high priests being present, you get exactly the same thing. They speak and they
[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:25.520]   make their requests and their statements, but our Lord, you see, he keeps silent. And the high
[00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:30.720]   priest arose and said unto him, "Answerest thou nothing? What is it which these witness against
[00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:37.760]   thee?" But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said unto him, "I adjure
[00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:41.600]   thee by the living God that thou tellest whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God." And again,
[00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:49.360]   you see, the indirect answer, "Thou hast said." Jesus said unto him, "Thou hast said." Nevertheless,
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:54.160]   I say unto you, hereafter shall ye see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of power and coming
[00:37:54.160 --> 00:38:02.720]   in the clouds of heaven and so on. Now here it is. And in the same way, he refuses to answer Pilate.
[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:10.480]   This is an absolute rule, an absolute law, my dear friends. If we are animated by this adulterous
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:16.960]   spirit, he will not grant us our requests. He has laid it down here at the very beginning of his
[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:22.480]   ministry in the temple at Jerusalem, and he persists with it right away through to the end.
[00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:28.720]   Very well, then. Now there is a general exposition to you of the teaching of our Lord himself
[00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:34.000]   concerning this whole matter. As I close, what are the lessons that you and I learn from this?
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.480]   And I suggest they are like this. First, we ask ourselves the question,
[00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:46.080]   are we guilty of spiritual adultery? Are we adulterous in a spiritual sense?
[00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:54.080]   How can I know that? Well, I have got to examine myself. We know the subtleties of our own
[00:38:54.080 --> 00:39:02.240]   unregenerate nature. The old man is gone, the old nature has not gone,
[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:10.240]   and we are still in the flesh. We know the devil and his subtlety. He will do anything to ruin
[00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:15.520]   the testimony of the Lord Jesus Christ and his great and glorious salvation. He will do anything.
[00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:23.280]   Our Lord himself says that towards the end, Satan will come out in such a way and perform such
[00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:30.800]   signs and miracles so as even almost to deceive the very elect. You read that for yourselves
[00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:38.560]   in Matthew 24. Now then, we cannot be too careful about this. You see, the devil will always have
[00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:45.840]   us to go from one extreme to the other. He will either make us deny the special, peculiar, glorious
[00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:53.120]   blessings of the Holy Spirit altogether, or he will drive us to excess on the other side, and
[00:39:53.120 --> 00:40:01.600]   both are wrong. Here is the teaching. Here is the perfect blending. He gives signs, but never at our
[00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:08.800]   requests, if our requests are animated by this evil and adulterous spirit. Therefore, I say,
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:14.080]   the first great question is, let us make sure that we have not an adulterous spiritual nature
[00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:20.800]   within us. How do you do so? Well, here are the tests. If you find in yourself any tendency to be
[00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:28.560]   dissatisfied with God and his ways, be careful. If you do not appreciate
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:34.640]   the great salvation that you have already got, if you tend to despise it
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:38.080]   or to speak disparagingly of it in any way, be careful.
[00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:46.800]   Even the very first beginnings of the Christian life are always miraculous and amazing and
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:54.080]   astounding, and should always cause us to marvel. Any tendency, therefore, to look down upon or to
[00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:59.200]   speak down upon any evidence of Christian life in and of itself is a dangerous sign.
[00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:04.960]   But still more important is this. A restless spirit, a lusting spirit,
[00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:14.160]   is always a sign of spiritual adultery. If you find yourself restless and lusting and wanting
[00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:20.800]   excitement and experiences, and always craving for them and seeking them and going to look for them,
[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:28.560]   my dear friend, you are in a dangerous condition. Be careful. I plead with you,
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:40.320]   in the name of God. The early spirit gives peace. The fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace. The
[00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:46.240]   Christian should not have this restless, dissatisfied craving that is always a characteristic
[00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:54.000]   of an adulterous spirit. Be careful of that. Be careful of becoming excited and being in a
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:42:01.120]   permanent state of excitement. There is no excitement in the true experience of the spirit.
[00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:06.560]   There is exhilaration, there is exaltation, there is joy, but it is entirely different
[00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:11.120]   from carnal excitement. The lusting spirit, on the other hand, the adulterous spirit,
[00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:16.880]   is always excited, and it is restless, and it cannot be satisfied. You will find tremendous
[00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:23.280]   descriptions of the adulteress in the book of Proverbs, how she smacks her lips and she wants
[00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:28.640]   yet more, and you cannot satisfy her, and it goes on and on and on. That is the adulterous spirit.
[00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:34.560]   God preserve us from it. Or let me perhaps give you what is the greatest test of all.
[00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:42.880]   If you find that you are tending to allow anything, and I underline anything,
[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:47.360]   as much as I can, if you ever find that you are beginning to allow anything
[00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:55.280]   to come before the Lord Jesus Christ in your thinking, and in your feelings, and in your
[00:42:55.280 --> 00:43:03.120]   desires, you are already guilty of spiritual adultery. No, we have got to put this thing
[00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:07.680]   plainly. If you think more of experiences that you have had than of him, you are wrong.
[00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:16.560]   You are already wrong. The Holy Spirit was sent not to call attention to himself,
[00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:26.000]   but to call attention to the Lord Jesus Christ. He shall glorify me. And if what you have had
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:31.440]   and what you have experienced does not lead you to glorify him more than you have ever done before,
[00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:34.400]   I suggest to you it is a spurious experience.
[00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:43.520]   If you find yourself talking more about experiences than you do about him,
[00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:52.480]   or any gift more than him, you have already gone astray. The Spirit is given, and he does give
[00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:58.720]   gifts, yes, but it is all meant to glorify him in our esteem, in our talk, our conversation,
[00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:04.160]   our everything. That is the object and the purpose of it all. And the moment anything
[00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:08.960]   comes between us and him, and the centrality of Christ, we have already gone astray.
[00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:18.320]   Or, if you find that you have become more interested in yourself and in your desires
[00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:26.080]   and in what happens to you than in his glory and in his praise, you are already, to put it at its
[00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:34.960]   very lowest, entering into a dangerous position. No, no, the Spirit is sent to glorify him. He
[00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:43.920]   shall not speak of himself, from himself, he shall glorify me. So, my dear friends,
[00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:49.680]   let us end on a word of exhortation. What are we to do then? We see the subtlety of this. We see
[00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:53.920]   how we can pass from the true to the false because of the devil and his pressure.
[00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:58.640]   What do we do? We will behave as the disciples did.
[00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:09.200]   Believe what you have got. Use what has already been given to you. You see, as Abraham says to
[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:16.320]   Daivys, "They have Moses and the prophets." "You are wrong," says Abraham to Daivys. "You say if
[00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:20.160]   someone sent to them from the dead, then they would believe." They would not believe. If they
[00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:25.120]   do not believe Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, even though one does rise
[00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:29.920]   from the dead. And they were not persuaded when our Lord rose from the dead. No, no, that is not
[00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:37.040]   the way. Conviction is always in terms of truth. Moses and the prophets, we have got them. We have
[00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:44.240]   got this book. So, concentrate on what he has given you. He has given the signs. The disciples
[00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:48.160]   are aware of that and they see and they begin to understand and their faith is strengthened.
[00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:52.560]   Not the other people. Give us something special. No, no, start with what you have got.
[00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:59.040]   Read your scriptures. Pray for enlightenment. Start in your Old Testament. Moses and the
[00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:03.840]   prophets. Work through it all. Look for him. Seek him everywhere. Come to the Gospels.
[00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:08.560]   Listen to him. Listen to his teaching. Watch him. Follow on in the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:14.000]   Go on to the Epistles. Go down the whole history of the Christian Church and see him coming and
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:19.200]   giving the power and the signs, but in the right way. Keep yourself to what he has given you
[00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:22.800]   and do not crave for anything outside that.
[00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:34.000]   Seek him, I say. Seek him always. Seek to know the Lord Jesus Christ. Seek to know his love.
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:39.600]   As long as you are seeking him, you will never go astray. But if you begin to seek other things
[00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:43.920]   rather than him, you will go astray. The devil, once he has got you looking in the other direction,
[00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:50.000]   he will press you on. Keep your eyes steadfast upon the Lord Jesus Christ. Tell him you want
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:54.240]   to have all that he has got to give you. Tell him that he has come to give the Spirit. Say,
[00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:59.040]   "I want to know you. That is what I want. I want to know your love. I do not want the Spirit as
[00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:04.400]   Spirit. I do not want ecstasies as ecstasies. I do not want miracles and signs. I want to know you."
[00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:14.960]   And then submit yourself utterly and absolutely to him. It may please him to give you most amazing
[00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:22.880]   signs, but he decides that, not you. Do not try to dictate to him. Do not become impatient with him.
[00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:28.720]   Do not say, "I must have this." No, no, you are already wrong. Fall at his feet. Wait for him.
[00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:37.840]   Ask and seek and knock. And go on doing so. Do not try to hurry him. Do not try to help him. He
[00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:41.840]   does not need your help. And you are opening the door to psychology when you try to help him in
[00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:48.000]   any shape or form. Go to him and ask him. Keep on asking him. Plead with him. Hold on to him
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:55.440]   alone. Look only unto him and to nobody and nothing else. And in his own time and in his own way,
[00:47:55.440 --> 00:48:02.160]   he may give you such a sign as will prostrate you to the floor
[00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:11.600]   and fill you with wonder and amazement, the sense of his holy, glorious presence.
[00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:19.600]   He may work miracles. He may do all sorts of amazing things to you. But what he has laid down
[00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:27.760]   at the very beginning in the temple at Jerusalem is this, that he only does such things in his own
[00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:42.560]   time and in his own way and to people who seek him, to know him and his glory. People who have
[00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:49.760]   a spiritual insight and understanding. People who, as the remainder of the chapter goes on to show,
[00:48:49.760 --> 00:49:00.240]   and we shall be studying, he can trust. And it is to them and to them alone that he chooses
[00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:07.680]   to commit himself. My dear friends, we are in a spiritual realm
[00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:18.960]   full of subtleties, full of dangers. But thank God, we have only to look to him and to listen
[00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:26.880]   to him and to wait upon him, to have all the blessings that God has treasured in him,
[00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:38.160]   in the heavenly places, and at the same time to be kept from the counterfeit of the evil one.
[00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:40.160]   Amen.
[00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:52.720]   The closing hymn is hymn number 443, 443. "O Jesus Christ,
[00:49:52.720 --> 00:50:00.720]   grow thou in me and all things else re-seed." 443.
