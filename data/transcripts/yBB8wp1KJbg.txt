[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.320]   Happy New Year to everyone who is listening.
[00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:12.080]   As we leave 2020 and embark into the great unknown of 2021,
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:18.240]   Pastor John and I are praying for you all, as Paul prayed in 2 Thessalonians 3.5,
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.960]   that the Lord will direct your hearts to the love of God and to the steadfastness
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.720]   of Jesus Christ. To that end, that your hearts would be
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.600]   riveted on the love of God, we kick off year number nine in this podcast,
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.880]   talking about daily Bible reading. With a new year means a reset on our
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.320]   Bible reading plans, and Pastor John, you used the Discipleship Journal Bible
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.360]   reading plan, something we talked about in episode 1140,
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.040]   an episode titled "A New Year, A New Bible Reading Plan." You can check that out if
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.720]   you want more, episode 1140. But today I want to talk
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.800]   about the sustained discipline and spiritual energy such a plan requires
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.960]   over the duration of an entire year. It is daunting for those who have never
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.440]   done it. It's daunting for those of us who have.
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.320]   But here's the question. Hello, Pastor John. My name is Angel.
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.800]   I'm 16. I strive to tell people around me about Jesus and to proclaim the gospel
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.080]   of salvation. But I find myself missing one major
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.560]   thing in my life that can be a huge obstacle,
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.640]   and that is my lack of desire for daily Bible reading.
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.400]   More often than not, I find myself forcefully reading the Word rather than
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.920]   having an actual passion for doing so. I desire to have that
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.760]   passion. I wonder sometimes if I lack it because I'm not a Christian
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:37.040]   at all. Would a regenerate heart neglect passionate Bible reading?
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.760]   I'm praying for this satisfaction. But what do I do now, especially with the new
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.840]   year and a new Bible reading plan ahead of me?
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.760]   Let me start this way. John Piper does not read through
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:59.360]   the Bible every year because there is a biblical law requiring me to do it.
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.800]   Rather, because there's something like a, I don't know what to call it, a natural
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.640]   law or spiritual law in my soul that sets off alarm bells
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.360]   if I don't.
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:19.520]   What I mean is this. My mental, psychological,
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:26.480]   spiritual condition has taught me over the years that without daily
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.320]   communion, daily fellowship with the living
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:36.720]   Christ, my God, my Savior, my treasure, my friend, in
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.280]   and through His Word, the totality of Scripture,
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:48.480]   without that, my sight of Him becomes blurred. I mean quickly, folks.
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.160]   We're not talking like, "Oh, he missed it for a month and he starts getting blurred."
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.240]   It doesn't work that way. Like you miss the Word
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.840]   for some hours of neglect or some days of neglect.
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:06.400]   My sight of Him becomes blurred. My savoring of Him becomes dull,
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.480]   and therefore my showing Him, which is what I exist for,
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.160]   through my life is diminished or forced. In other words, I believe that
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:25.440]   God has established that ongoing reception of the Word of God day by day
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.920]   is the ordinary means by which we fellowship
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:37.360]   with Him through the Spirit in Christ. This is His design, not mine.
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:44.960]   And when I speak of a law in my own soul, all I mean is that I have discovered
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:50.080]   that in my case, that daily fellowship with God by the
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.680]   Spirit, through His Word, to sustain my sight of
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.880]   Him and my savoring of Him and my showing of Him,
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:05.840]   that happens best through reading the whole Bible year by year, about
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:12.000]   four or five chapters a day. Some people are disinclined to do this
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.400]   because they fall behind and give up, which is why I love the
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.240]   Discipleship Journal reading plan, because you only read 25 days out of
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.640]   each month, which gives you five or six days at the
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.600]   end of every month to catch up, which is genius.
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.160]   But what I want to do in the next just a few minutes,
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.160]   at the beginning of the year here, is not persuade people
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:40.800]   of a particular plan, but to give the profound biblical truth and
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.120]   reality that ongoing feeding
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:51.920]   upon the Word of God day by day is built into God's way of saving you.
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:57.200]   In other words, we're not putting icing on the cake of Christianity when we talk
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:02.560]   about Bible reading. We're talking about the cake of God's
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:08.800]   spiritual plan to preserve you and bring you safely to heaven
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.720]   with all the necessary holiness that the Spirit
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:19.920]   creates only by the Word of God. So here are three passages of
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:25.440]   Scripture that are, to my mind, simply explosive
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:32.160]   with serious, wonderful implications about feeding day by day on God's Word,
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.360]   and I hope that these three passages answer
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.920]   angels' concern specifically about the relationship between
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:44.640]   regeneration and Bible reading. So the first is 1 Peter 1,
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.720]   23 to chapter 2, verse 3. Here's what it says.
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.200]   "You have been born again, not of perishable seed, but of
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:58.880]   imperishable through," here it comes, "through the living and abiding
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:04.400]   Word of God. For all flesh is like grass, all its glory like the flower of grass.
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.080]   The grass withers, the flower falls, but the Word of the Lord remains forever.
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.120]   And this Word is the good news that was preached to you.
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.760]   So put away all malice and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy and slander and,"
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:20.240]   here it comes, "like newborn infants," since you were just born again,
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:27.520]   "like newborn infants, long for the pure spiritual milk that by it you might,"
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:32.800]   here it is, "grow up into salvation." Amazing!
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.800]   Indeed, if you have tasted that the Lord is good.
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.040]   So here's four really plain observations that anybody could get
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:44.640]   from this text. Number one, the miracle of new birth,
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:48.880]   the coming into being of a Christian as a child of God,
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:52.080]   happens through the Word of God. Number two,
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.200]   our experience of that miracle is described as
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.880]   tasting that the Lord is good. Before we were born again,
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.880]   the Lord did not taste good. He tasted boring. The Word was boring.
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:06.080]   His cross was foolishness. Heaven was unreal.
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:09.840]   Nothing about this faith tasted satisfying or real.
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:14.800]   Now, having been born again, we have tasted, tasted.
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.840]   Something's come alive. There are taste buds now on the
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:23.040]   tongue of our soul, and He and His Word are very delectable.
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:26.480]   Number three, nevertheless, even though they are
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:32.720]   delectable, nevertheless, we must be told to desire the spiritual food.
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:37.600]   In other words, eating is not automatic. Who would tell us to do it if it's
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.880]   automatic? Our desires rise and they fall.
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:44.400]   They're passionate one day, and they're lukewarm the next day.
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:48.080]   Peter didn't give us this command, "Desire it, desire it,
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:51.760]   desire it," because we didn't need to hear that command.
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:55.920]   We need to be told it is essential and crucial that you desire this.
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:00.880]   Do what you have to do to stoke this desire for spiritual food in the Word of
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:05.280]   God by which you were born again. And number four,
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:13.280]   here's the real serious point, desire it so that you may grow up into salvation.
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:19.760]   That means that the evidence of your new birth will be shown
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:24.560]   by your ongoing feeding on the Word of God,
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:29.840]   which works in you all the kinds of things that keep you on the narrow road
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:34.640]   that leads to life and final salvation. It's not a small thing. So what people
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:40.320]   should ask themselves is this, if they are not pursuing
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:46.720]   a daily strategy of feeding on the Word of God, what
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:54.080]   is your alternative strategy for growing up into salvation?
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:58.000]   Those are Peter's words. They're not mine. God's word
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:04.400]   is designed by God to help us grow up into salvation. If you don't use the
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:07.280]   Word that way, day in and day out, what's your
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:13.440]   alternative strategy for making it home? Here's the second text, James 1, 18 and 21.
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:18.240]   "Of his own will, God brought us forth by the word of truth."
[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:22.160]   It's just like being born again. "That we should be a kind of first fruits
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.600]   of his creatures, put away all filthiness and rampant
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:29.680]   wickedness, and receive with meekness the implanted
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:34.000]   word." Receive with meekness the implanted word,
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.320]   which is able to save your souls. Isn't that amazing?
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:43.120]   So Peter and James, without quoting each other, we know that because the language
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:46.720]   is so different, are nevertheless talking exactly about the
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:49.920]   same thing. One, God brought us forth by the word.
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:53.360]   Peter said we were born again by the word. And second,
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:56.400]   Peter says, "Long for the word." And James says,
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:00.560]   "Receive with meekness the implanted word." It's already in you.
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:03.840]   Now receive it. You've been born again by it. Now go on
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:08.560]   daily, meekly, embracing it, receiving it, meditating on it, praying
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:12.320]   over it, eating it, savoring it in a meek disposition.
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:17.680]   And third, Peter says, "In order that you may grow up into salvation." And James says,
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:21.440]   "Which is able to save your souls." That's simply amazing, folks.
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:25.840]   That is really serious when these two writers say exactly the same thing in
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:28.400]   such different language, because the nature of it, the
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:32.560]   essence of it, is so baked in to what it means to be a Christian. I
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:36.720]   mean, this is really serious. Both Peter and James say that the
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:40.240]   Christian life begins with the new birth, which is brought about by the word of
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:44.320]   God. Both of them stress that in order to make it home to final
[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:48.240]   salvation, we need to be receiving the word meekly.
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:54.880]   We need to be drinking in the milk daily, because by it we grow up into
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:11:02.080]   salvation. It keeps us in a vital, happy fellowship with Jesus and brings
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:04.800]   us safely home. And let me just mention one more
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:10.400]   quickly from John 6, 63, where Jesus says, "It is the Spirit who gives life. The
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:14.880]   flesh is of no help at all. The words that I have spoken to you are
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:19.440]   Spirit and life." There it is. The words, the words, the
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:23.520]   words that I have spoken to you are Spirit
[00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:30.080]   and life. To which Peter responds, "Lord, to whom then shall we go? You have
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:35.520]   the words of eternal life." The words of Jesus are life.
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:39.520]   So many people treat the Christian life as though it were a natural or
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:42.720]   automatic thing, that they're going to have life tomorrow,
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:49.120]   that they have today. It isn't automatic. It is sure for God's elect. They will
[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:52.880]   have life tomorrow. He will see to it that they make it to
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:57.920]   heaven. But the elect, real Christians, realize
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:04.320]   that God's way of getting them home is preserving them and keeping them in
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:10.720]   fellowship with Christ by saying, "My words are your life,"
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:16.000]   and feeding on them every day. So here at the beginning of the year,
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:22.560]   "Oh, that I could so pray that the Spirit would so
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:28.240]   work that the hearts of his people," many of them listening to this, "that the
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:33.680]   hearts of his people would hear what I am saying, not as a
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:39.200]   burden but as life. May I simply testify."
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:43.040]   Here at the beginning of the year, I get to give my testimony.
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:50.160]   I love to get up early in the morning, grab my cup of hot tea in the wintertime,
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:56.640]   sit in my chair for an hour, and enjoy fellowship with
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:03.280]   Jesus, the living King of the universe, in four different places of the Bible. It
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:09.600]   is my life. And may I say it again, it is my life.
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:13.600]   Oh, may God cause you to experience his Word
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:19.360]   as life. Amen. So good. There is nothing automatic in the daily
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:22.320]   disciplines. Thank you, Pastor John, for that reminder.
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:26.160]   And just to reiterate, Pastor John himself uses the Discipleship Journal

[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:49.680]   Well, in the midst of this year-long pandemic, much talk has been given to
[00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:52.960]   the hope of a vaccine to help finally end
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:57.360]   the coronavirus outbreak. But such an outlook raises one of the
[00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:04.160]   hottest questions in the inbox. Can I take a vaccine made from the tissue
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:09.200]   of an aborted child? This is a big--for pro-life folks like
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:13.280]   us, this is a big question. It's up next time on Monday when we
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:18.000]   return. I'm your host Tony Renke. We'll see you then.
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:20.960]   you
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:30.960]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
