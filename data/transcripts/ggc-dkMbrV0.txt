[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.400]   - Hey Cal, my name is Kobe Amponso.
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.720]   First off, I wanna say thank you
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.320]   for all the work you've been doing.
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.400]   It's been extremely powerful and impactful in my life,
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.560]   so I appreciate you for it,
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.640]   and I encourage you to keep going.
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.680]   My question is, I have a stock investing program,
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.800]   and the goal of my program is to really educate beginners
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.600]   on how to use leverage stock investing
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.960]   to increase their income potential.
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.080]   And I'm finding that I'm getting to a point
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.440]   where I feel like I have to convince people to do something
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.200]   that would really benefit their lives.
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.280]   And normally it's people approaching me.
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.960]   And you know, part of the problem is that
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.040]   maybe I'm not doing as good of a job
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.480]   as connecting their problem to my solution.
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.080]   That might be part of it.
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.360]   But the other side is that I'm spending all this time
[00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.880]   trying to convince people to join the program
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.040]   and I could be sharpening my sword
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.800]   and maybe even increasing my income potential, right?
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.040]   Learning never stops, so I'm sure you know that as well.
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.140]   So is it better for me to continue trying to find a way
[00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.880]   to get to these customers in a better way,
[00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.480]   or do I just sharpen my sword, focus on myself,
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.320]   and then have them follow me afterwards?
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.760]   I do have a goal of becoming a hedge fund manager
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.240]   and I'm working towards that.
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.400]   So that might be a route that I wanna take.
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.320]   So I just wanted to know your thoughts on that.
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.920]   - Well, Kobe, I am gonna lean towards your instinct here
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.920]   of focusing more on yourself and your performance
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.000]   and being so good that you can't be ignored.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.320]   That's almost always gonna be the right approach
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.360]   in these situations.
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.520]   Selling is important, right?
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.240]   You do have to sell if you're in any type of industry
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.480]   where you need to get clients.
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.920]   But if you're spending too much time selling,
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.580]   especially in something like this,
[00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.580]   I would be worried that that is a signal
[00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.320]   that's telling you that you need to go back
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.320]   to the woodshed or back to the sword sharpening stone.
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.340]   So if what you're trying to sell here
[00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.720]   is leveraged stock investing,
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.920]   first of all, become richer.
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.280]   I mean, this is the irony of what you're selling.
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.140]   What's gonna make this appealing to people to buy
[00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.880]   is gonna be when you get to the situation
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.440]   where you don't need them to buy it.
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.820]   And I know that sounds kind of circular,
[00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.680]   but if you're saying there's all the success
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.240]   you can have financially by doing leveraged stock buying,
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.720]   then people need to see that you're having
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.160]   a lot of success doing it,
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.900]   which will lower the pressure for you to do the selling
[00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.840]   because you'll be doing fine financially anyways.
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.500]   That's gonna add more authenticity to what you're selling
[00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.760]   because you're producing something you believe in.
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.360]   You're not trying to push a lot of different students
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.200]   into it.
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.420]   You'll gravitate more students towards you
[00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.140]   in that situation.
[00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.820]   And then more generally, what I would say is keep in mind
[00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.360]   the concept from my book, "So Good They Can't Ignore You,"
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.800]   which is the law of financial viability.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.540]   And this was an idea that I borrowed
[00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.900]   from the entrepreneur Derek Sivers,
[00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.900]   who said, "Money and people's willingness to give it to you
[00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.660]   "is a good neutral indicator of value."
[00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.100]   So how do you know, for example,
[00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.880]   if your course is good or not,
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.360]   how easily are people giving you money to take it?
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.260]   And if it's a real struggle,
[00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.900]   think about that as being a real honest return.
[00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.020]   It's not there yet.
[00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:36.340]   I mean, maybe they're picking up,
[00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.820]   like, why is Kobe not more successful himself?
[00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.740]   Or there's something about the quality of the course,
[00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:41.920]   and it's a really important signal.
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.060]   So that's what I would say.
[00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.100]   Sharpen your sword, to use your terminology.
[00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.460]   Get better at what you're doing.
[00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:48.660]   Hone your system.
[00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.700]   Have demonstrable results.
[00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.460]   Keep polishing and improving that course.
[00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:54.780]   Put the word out there.
[00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:55.980]   I mean, you want people to know it's there,
[00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.740]   but don't push super hard to sell it.
[00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.300]   What you wanna see is that relative signal
[00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.860]   of it's easier to get the people I'm getting.
[00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.140]   More people are coming.
[00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.900]   With less effort, I'm hitting a mark
[00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.580]   that I used to have to really push to before.
[00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.300]   And that'll be your signal that this is getting better,
[00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.620]   that the course is getting to a place
[00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.700]   that maybe is worth having even more energy pushed into.
[00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.280]   (upbeat music)
