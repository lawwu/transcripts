[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.800]   - Happy Friday, everyone.
[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.520]   Today we have a question from a listener named Mary.
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.080]   Actually, I should say we have several questions
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.080]   wrapped up into one from Mary.
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.200]   Here it is, Pastor John, hello.
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.420]   I have a hard question and I'll articulate it
[00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.040]   as best as I can.
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.440]   The Apostle Paul commands Christians to put to death,
[00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.360]   therefore, what is earthly in you,
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.680]   sexual immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire,
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.680]   and covetousness, which is idolatry.
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.560]   We are to put these sins to death because, as Paul says,
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.220]   on account of these, the wrath of God is coming.
[00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.480]   That's Colossians 3, verses five to six.
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.360]   We are commanded to die to sin,
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.120]   impulses that remain in us.
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.780]   So something earthly remains in us,
[00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.880]   and yet these same sin impulses,
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.880]   things like evil desires, warrant God's eternal wrath.
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.040]   So is the ground of judgment the acting out of sins
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.400]   beyond merely harboring the impulse within,
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.480]   or is this very tendency in us a diminished
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.940]   but still present earthly desire towards sins allure,
[00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.640]   also ground for eternal judgment?
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.800]   Or is putting to death sin the complete eradication
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.700]   of evil desires from in us?
[00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.900]   Or is it, by grace, tamping down those desires
[00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.520]   that will always be there,
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.960]   but not acting out consistently on those impulses?
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.160]   If so, how would that apply to not just the acted out sins,
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.520]   but specifically here to the evil desires Paul talks about?
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.260]   Wow, I mean, what would you say to Mary?
[00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.100]   - My goodness.
[00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.400]   (laughing)
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.760]   Those are five good questions.
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.880]   I mean, I counted them with you.
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.340]   Oh my goodness, she's really overflowing with,
[00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.700]   and they really are really quite good questions.
[00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.080]   She asks, is putting to death sin
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.920]   the complete eradication of the desires?
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.120]   And I think I would start with that one,
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.400]   because that one's easy.
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.300]   The answer's no.
[00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.240]   (laughing)
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.320]   No, it's not.
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.000]   If that were the case, in other words,
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.240]   if by the first prayer, by the first act of holiness,
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.800]   or act of obedience, we totally eradicated
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.080]   all evil desire in our lives,
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.240]   this passage would read very differently than it does.
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.780]   Paul would not be writing to Christians
[00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.560]   to get on with their warfare against sin,
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.480]   if that were the case.
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.300]   Colossians 3 is not written
[00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.260]   as if during your first week as a Christian,
[00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.340]   you put a sinful desire to death,
[00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.720]   and then for the rest of your life, you never deal with it.
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.900]   That's not the way the New Testament reads at all.
[00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.320]   But to see that, we better read these verses.
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.160]   Let me read Colossians 3, 5 to 10.
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.120]   It says, "Put to death, therefore, what is earthly in you."
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.400]   Now, literally, it says,
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.080]   "Put to death your members that are on the earth,"
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.160]   which is very odd.
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.480]   What it means is, to the degree that your tongue,
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.400]   or arm, or sexual organ,
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.800]   is about to be taken over by a sinful impulse,
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.000]   treat it as dead and unresponsive.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.480]   So let me start over.
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.620]   "Put to death your members on the earth,
[00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.620]   sexual immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire,
[00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.240]   covetousness, which is idolatry,
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:45.240]   on account of these, the wrath of God is coming."
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.680]   "In these, you too once walked when you were living in them,
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.480]   but now you must,"
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.360]   here's the imperative, "must put them all away."
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.560]   "Anger, wrath, malice, slander, obscene talk from your mouth.
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.360]   Do not lie to one another,
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.260]   seeing that you have put off the old self with its practices
[00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.260]   and have put on the new self, which is being renewed."
[00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.800]   Not a done deal, it's being renewed in knowledge
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.320]   after the image of its creator.
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.540]   That's Colossians 3, 5 through 10.
[00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.440]   There is a new self.
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.760]   That's what it means to be born again,
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.000]   to become a new creation in Christ,
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   to be united to Christ so that his life is our life.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.200]   This is a done reality for all true Christians.
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:47.200]   And the rest of the Christian life is to become what we are,
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:52.280]   to become in desire and in practice
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.720]   what you are in union with Christ,
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.040]   or as Paul says here in Colossians 3,
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:02.040]   "To put off the old self, put on the new self,
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:07.920]   or put to death the old and to walk in the newness of life."
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.520]   But there's no thought here that the absoluteness
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:18.400]   of the new self implies an absoluteness of emotional
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.600]   or behavioral perfection in this life.
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.560]   So that question we can just put aside.
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:30.560]   There is a complete eradication of sinful desire,
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:36.040]   but that will happen when we die and go to be with Christ,
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.600]   or if he comes back during our lifetime.
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.800]   It's not going to happen while we're living
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.560]   in this fallen age.
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.160]   Now, the next question that I think is also relatively easy
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.560]   to answer that she asks is,
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:57.840]   is the wrath of God a response to the behavioral
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.240]   outworkings of inner evil desire,
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:06.240]   or do the desires themselves bring down the wrath of God?
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:13.560]   And I assume the reason this question feels urgent to Mary
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.560]   is that my answer to the first question,
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:21.200]   which I think she already knows and agrees with,
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:26.200]   implies that we still have those old desires
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.680]   that have to be battled with,
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.360]   which raises the question whether the wrath of God
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.420]   is going to come down upon us because of the desires
[00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:37.580]   that God hates rising up in us.
[00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:43.700]   Now, the answer to the first part of that question is yes,
[00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:49.120]   the wrath of God comes upon both behavioral sin
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:54.160]   and upon sinful desires that lie beneath those behaviors.
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.840]   And I say that simply because that's exactly
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.920]   what the text says in Colossians 3, 5, and 6.
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:04.320]   It says, "Put to death," and then it names five things,
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:08.900]   "sexual immorality," now that is acts,
[00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:12.520]   that's various acts of the body
[00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:14.520]   contrary to the will of God,
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:19.080]   sinful, sexual, bodily actions.
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.560]   And then it says, "impurity,"
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:26.560]   and then three internal desire-type words,
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:31.800]   passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry.
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:36.720]   And then it says, "on account of these," these,
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:40.120]   these five realities, both the actions and the desires,
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:43.400]   on account of these, the wrath of God is coming.
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.760]   These refers back to all five of those things,
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.900]   the behavior of sexual immorality and impurity,
[00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.840]   and then three references to desires,
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:55.720]   passion, evil desire, covetousness,
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:08:00.480]   all three of those last desires
[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:04.560]   precede and are beneath behaviors.
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:07.360]   And Paul says, "on account of these,"
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.840]   both the behaviors and the desires,
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:09.900]   "the wrath of God is coming,"
[00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:13.480]   which brings us then to the most urgent question,
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:16.840]   which I think is implied in what Mary's asking,
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:20.800]   namely, well, if evil desires
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:25.800]   continue to rise up in the hearts of born-again people,
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:29.880]   how will we escape the wrath of God,
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:32.120]   which is coming against such desires?
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:35.400]   And the answer has two parts.
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:40.400]   First, becoming a Christian means
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:46.360]   that God unites us to Christ by faith
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:53.480]   so that His death, Christ's death on the cross
[00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:58.480]   becomes the payment for all of our sins
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:03.960]   and the ground of all our total forgiveness
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:08.600]   for all the sins we will ever do,
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:12.080]   whether desires or actions.
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:15.640]   You know, there's just a few verses earlier,
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:18.460]   Colossians 2, 13 and 14, Paul said this,
[00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:21.160]   "God made you alive with Christ,
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:26.160]   "having forgiven all our trespasses
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:30.040]   "by canceling the record of debt
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:33.720]   "that stood against us with its legal demands.
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:36.720]   "This He set aside, nailing it to the cross."
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:41.640]   So the entire record of debt
[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:45.280]   for all the sins that we will ever commit,
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:49.600]   that's behavior sins and desire sins,
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:52.520]   was nailed to the cross.
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:54.200]   That's just breathtakingly wonderful.
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.040]   - That is.
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:57.160]   - So the first answer to the question,
[00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:00.320]   why the wrath of God will not fall upon us
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:03.960]   for the sins of our remaining evil desires
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:08.000]   is that Jesus paid the penalty for them
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.160]   and secured complete forgiveness.
[00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:16.160]   Wrath comes upon unforgiven evil desire.
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:21.840]   Christ bore the wrath for forgiven evil desire.
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:28.280]   Therefore, it won't come upon us because we are forgiven.
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:31.600]   Now, the second part of the answer
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:35.640]   for why the wrath of God will not fall upon Christians,
[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:38.600]   even though we have remaining sin in us,
[00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:44.720]   is just as essential, though not as foundational.
[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:50.880]   The wrath of God will not fall upon true believers
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:55.880]   because we confirm our union with Christ
[00:10:55.880 --> 00:11:03.480]   and our state of acceptance with God and our forgiveness
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:07.860]   by the war we make on our sinful desires.
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:11.200]   Many people do not understand this.
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:16.200]   They think that if they are secure in Christ,
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:21.640]   then the battle against sinful desires is not essential.
[00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:25.080]   Now, that's wrong.
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.680]   It is essential.
[00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:27.920]   It's necessary.
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:30.800]   Because if the battle is forsaken
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:36.640]   and we make peace with sin in our lives,
[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:42.160]   then we fail to confirm that we are united to Christ.
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:48.840]   We fail to confirm that we are a new creation
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:51.480]   because the new creation in Christ
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:55.360]   was created for good works, for holiness.
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:58.960]   Therefore, the failure to pursue good works,
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:03.600]   the failure to fight sin in ourselves,
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:05.800]   to fight for holiness,
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:09.980]   shows that a person is not a new creation.
[00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:12.840]   Here's the way Paul says it in Romans 8:13.
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:17.680]   If you live according to the flesh, you'll die.
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.920]   But if by the Spirit you put to death
[00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:22.380]   the deeds of the body, you will live.
[00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:26.040]   In other words, if the Holy Spirit dwells in you,
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:29.780]   you will make war on sin in your life.
[00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:34.140]   And the result will be the escape from wrath
[00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:36.800]   and the enjoyment of everlasting life.
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:42.920]   Not because the warfare against sin provides forgiveness,
[00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:45.360]   doesn't work like that,
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:49.680]   but because it shows that we are forgiven.
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:51.000]   We are in Christ.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.920]   We are a new creation.
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:58.920]   So in summary, no, there is no eradication of sin.
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:03.920]   There is no eradication of all evil desire in this life.
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:09.660]   Second, yes, wrath is coming upon both
[00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:14.700]   sinful behavior and sinful desire.
[00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:19.700]   Third, but that wrath will only come upon
[00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:23.780]   unforgiven sinful behavior and desire.
[00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:28.620]   And we confirm that we live in the safety
[00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:33.620]   by hating and making war on our sinful desires
[00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:36.220]   by the Holy Spirit.
[00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:38.100]   - Yeah, thank you for answering those five questions,
[00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:38.940]   Pastor John and Mary.
[00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:41.000]   Thank you for laboring to put those questions to us
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.640]   so clearly and with such great articulation.
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:46.840]   Speaking of evil desires in the Christian experience,
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:49.360]   we need to address the big debate over Romans 7
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:51.580]   and whether Paul is there talking about
[00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:53.480]   the struggles of a believer
[00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:56.160]   or the struggles of a pre-believer.
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:59.640]   And that's coming up in a week next Friday, I think.
[00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:02.440]   Yeah, episode 1767 next Friday.
[00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:04.280]   Don't miss it and you won't miss it

[00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:28.680]   Well, speaking of hot questions,
[00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:30.600]   it will probably come as no surprise to anyone
[00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.320]   that over the past year or so,
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:34.200]   we have received a dozen or so emails
[00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:35.640]   on whether or not it's a good idea
[00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:39.420]   to dramatize the life of Christ on television.
[00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:41.600]   And that is the question of next time.
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:42.480]   I'm your host, Tony Rehnke.
