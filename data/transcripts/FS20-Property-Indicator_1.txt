[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000]   Hello, everybody.
[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.880]   It's Sam from Financial Samurai.
[00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.000]   And in this episode, I'm going to talk about a new property
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.160]   leading indicator that should give buyers confidence to buy.
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.000]   And I call it the FS20 property indicator.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.240]   Not that original of a name, sorry.
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.840]   But I think the concept itself is quite original.
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.560]   And this is something that I think every property
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.000]   buyer, prospective property buyer,
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.800]   should think about when they're about to buy,
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.840]   because property prices have risen so aggressively
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.440]   in many parts of the country and the world
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:36.400]   since about 2010, 2012 period.
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.360]   So given real estate is relatively eliquid,
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.880]   there's huge room to get your property transaction right
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.040]   or wrong.
[00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.920]   So my hope is for all of you to get maximum value,
[00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.360]   whether you're buying or selling.
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.320]   But the FS20 indicator is more for folks
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.960]   who are going to be buying.
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.360]   So let me share with you some thoughts
[00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.360]   about what this indicator does.
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.640]   So FS stands for Financial Samurai.
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.600]   20 stands for 20%.
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.200]   The FS20 property indicator goes off
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.760]   when a home's final sales price is at least 20% higher
[00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.760]   than the online estimate in the neighborhood you want to buy.
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.680]   So by now, 2019, everybody should
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.800]   be leveraging technology and the internet
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.880]   to find properties, to analyze properties,
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.000]   and to make offers.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.400]   Zillow and Redfin, they were both founded in 2004.
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.000]   So in the first 5, 10 years, they
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.320]   weren't that accurate, I would say.
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.960]   Their databases were still being formed.
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.040]   But now, 15 years later, their estimates
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.560]   are about as good as they've ever been.
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.800]   They probably are as good as they've ever been, right?
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.180]   They're publicly traded companies.
[00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.840]   They have to improve their algorithms
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.040]   to stay competitive and to stay relevant,
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.520]   or else their shareholders will revolt.
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.040]   So technology is key in your property hunt.
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.440]   And the FS20 property indicator is
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.840]   key when you're analyzing any property,
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.360]   because there are a lot of indicators out there
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.480]   on things you should follow to decide
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.480]   whether the property price is going
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.080]   to go up in the future or down.
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.280]   So some indicators include interest rates.
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.360]   If interest rates go down, like they are right now,
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.560]   property prices should go up, given
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.400]   it brings in more demand and more affordability.
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.680]   But you don't know exactly how much a property will appreciate
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.680]   or how much a property is worth for every 25 basis point
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.320]   drop in interest rate.
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.240]   It's just a derivative indicator that you
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.840]   can make educated guesses on.
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.200]   You just don't quite know.
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:47.720]   Other indicators include economic health, inflation,
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.840]   laws, the presidency, trade wars.
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.560]   There's a whole bunch of different things,
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.640]   and obviously the job market.
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.440]   But the FS20 indicator is very interesting,
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.760]   and it's very pertinent, because I
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.100]   think the best indicator for what a property is worth
[00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.120]   is a comparable sale.
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.400]   So if a house you want to buy sells for, let's say,
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.380]   a million dollars, and then the neighboring house goes up
[00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.540]   for sale a month later, chances are very high
[00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.060]   that if the two houses are quite similar in terms
[00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.940]   of the quality of the build and the plot of land and so forth,
[00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.480]   that other house is going to be worth at least a million dollars
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.640]   as well.
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.280]   It's just a month later.
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.520]   So a comparable sales price is the number one indicator
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.800]   for what a property is worth.
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.480]   And so when a home's final sales price
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.000]   is at least 20% higher than the online estimate
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.760]   in the neighborhood you want to buy,
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.960]   that is a high, high quality indicator
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.040]   that there is demand for property in that neighborhood
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.800]   and that prices are likely going up.
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.680]   Now, why do I use 20% as the price differential?
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.680]   The reason why is that Redfin and Zillow
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.800]   and any other online property estimator,
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.560]   they aren't perfect yet, even after 15 years of operation.
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.480]   Even after thousands and thousands, probably
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.720]   tens of thousands of homes being sold and inputted
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.200]   in their database and engineers and all these people working
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.280]   on their algorithms and estimates,
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.040]   they're not perfectly accurate.
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.200]   I don't think Zillow--
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.640]   Zillow has a lot of problems, in my opinion.
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.360]   I've looked at many properties on Zillow.
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.800]   I'm like, wow, you're way off.
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.840]   Whereas Redfin, I think, is a little bit better.
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.000]   I think it's much better, actually.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.760]   I don't know why, but they're much better.
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.160]   The user interface is better.
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.320]   So that's the company that I use.
[00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.760]   And so it is very common to see price fluctuations
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:49.520]   of between 10%, I think, plus or minus,
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.320]   in terms of what an online estimate calculates
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.680]   and what you believe the property is worth
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.440]   and what it actually finally sells for.
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.640]   Because there's a lot of things that are not
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:01.960]   captured by online estimates.
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.520]   Sometimes you might have remodeled a kitchen, right?
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.960]   And the kitchen might cost $50,000.
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.640]   But unless the homeowner updates that data,
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.280]   the algorithms online aren't going
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.400]   to capture that information.
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.400]   You might have some unwarranted space that's
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.360]   30% of the size of your livable space.
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.800]   And that's pretty valuable if you
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.560]   want to create a band down there,
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.560]   create a man cave or a woman cave,
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.600]   or whatever you want to do.
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.200]   Elsewhere, you might have a plot of land
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.600]   that shows up great in terms of size online,
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:46.360]   but only maybe 25%, 30% of that space, that plot of land
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.480]   is flat and usable.
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.920]   So therefore, online estimates could overvalue your property
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:52.720]   as well.
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.000]   So whatever the case may be, there's
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.800]   always errors within plus or minus 10%.
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.360]   There's also errors plus or minus 15%.
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.720]   But once you get to a sales price above 20%
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:10.920]   of the online estimate, I think it's a real signal that
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.400]   demand is really there.
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.160]   And what's interesting is that you
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.040]   have to be diligent in using the FS20 property indicator.
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.680]   So you've got to be on the ball.
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.600]   As soon as a property sells, you need to do your analysis.
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.400]   Because what happens is all the data that comes out
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.120]   from the MLS is lagging data.
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:36.280]   And given the data is lagging, you have an opportunity.
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.240]   So this is how it works, folks.
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.080]   You see a sale that is just huge.
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:45.160]   Let's say it's 25% above the Redfin estimate.
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.760]   You go back and you compare that price per square foot
[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:53.980]   to the average price per square foot of the lagging data,
[00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:55.880]   according to MLS.
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:59.720]   So in a post that I write, I highlight two examples.
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:04.240]   And one example, let's say it's sold for $1,200 a square foot
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.160]   for this particular house.
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.640]   But the average price per square foot from the lagging data
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.720]   from months ago, for the past three months
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.840]   when there were 15 sales or whatever the case may be,
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:19.120]   was only around $950.
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:23.120]   So you have that spread there where you can go and bid
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.500]   with confidence.
[00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.560]   Any similar type of property, like the home that's
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.980]   sold for $1,200 a square foot, you
[00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:34.280]   can bid with confidence at the average price per square foot
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.680]   or a little bit higher to be very competitive.
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.240]   Depends on how much you want that house.
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:44.040]   But it's only after about one to four months
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:47.400]   where the data will start reflecting the most
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.140]   recent blockbuster sale.
[00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:52.580]   And then by that time, the property market
[00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:57.200]   will move up and reflect the new average price per square foot
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:01.920]   data, or it'll go down if a lot of these homes
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:04.440]   are selling below the online estimates.
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.560]   So you've got to be really, really on the ball
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.720]   and use this window of opportunity
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:11.920]   with the FS20 property indicator to snag
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:15.400]   your property for a great price before the world wakes up
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:20.160]   and realizes that the market has moved much higher or much
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:21.360]   lower.
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:25.200]   I just want to point out that everybody must not only analyze
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.040]   the numbers online, but they also
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:31.000]   have to kick the sheetrock and go visit these properties
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.080]   to make sure the numbers are congruent with what
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.960]   you see with your own eyes.
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:41.360]   A lot of the stuff, again, is just a lot of smoke and mirrors
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:44.880]   online in terms of marketing and pictures and stuff like that.
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.480]   It's only after you do the numbers
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:49.240]   and you go to the open house or a private showing
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:53.120]   and you compare the numbers with what you see and how you feel.
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:55.560]   That's going to give you a great indicator.
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:58.120]   And one exercise I want everyone to do
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:01.920]   when buying or selling a house is to go visit a property
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:07.040]   without knowing the price, walk through the property thoroughly,
[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:12.040]   and then guess what the list price is,
[00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:16.480]   and then guess what the final sales price will be.
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:19.560]   And the more you can guess that list price and final sales
[00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:23.440]   price accurately to within a 1% to 2% margin,
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.960]   the better you're investing acumen in real estate.
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.000]   This is really important.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.360]   And it's a really fun exercise.
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:31.920]   So bring your friend, bring your wife, your husband, your kids,
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:34.280]   whatever, and just play the guessing game.
