[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.080]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.920]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now,
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.800]   while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less. Today on the show, I have one
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:38.880]   simple concept to share with you, and it is this. Be careful to look out for what's not said
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:47.760]   anytime you are engaging in financial discussions. Be careful for the missing alternative
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:55.440]   that you're not knowledgeable enough to ask about. Let me give you an example. Yesterday on the Q&A
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.920]   show, I had a listener who was asking me whether it was appropriate for a woman in her 60s with a
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.400]   fairly simple financial life who is living primarily on social security income and a pension
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.880]   income, but also has a million dollars of assets available. And she's investing that money in
[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.920]   an account where she's paying a financial advisor a 1.7% fee for advice on the account.
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.600]   And the question that my listener asked was, "Is that a good thing, or should they move
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.760]   somewhere else where she would be able to pay a lower fee?" That's a hard question to answer,
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:39.360]   because it involves the actual person, the woman, the investor involved, and what's important to
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.040]   her. But in my discussion of the question with my listener, we started talking about portfolio
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.440]   returns, and my listener shared with me that one of the frustrations is that her portfolio is
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:56.800]   invested very conservatively, and it's primarily in bonds and fixed income investments. And because
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:04.000]   of that, when you take in the substantial 1.7% asset management fee, he felt that she was really
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.120]   underperforming, and I agreed with him. And we discussed the situation. I discovered that this
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:14.160]   woman could live on her income from social security, and she could live on her income from
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:22.960]   the pension account. And in that conversation, we discussed the fact that my recommendation would be,
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:28.080]   since she's going to leave this money behind for her heirs and beneficiaries as some form of
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:35.200]   inheritance, that she should set a financial goal of maximizing her money so that it could
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:41.120]   be the biggest pot possible when it's left behind to the people that she wants it to go to.
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.760]   And I did some math on the show. I did a financial calculation, and I said, "Let's assume that she
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.800]   has $1 million in today's dollars," and I said, "Let's assume she's going to keep the money
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:56.320]   invested for the next 30 years of her lifespan, and let's assume that she makes no further
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.960]   contributions to the account, but that she doesn't take any distributions from the account."
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:08.800]   And I said, "Let's compare what value a good financial advisor could bring to her if that
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.480]   financial advisor were able to persuade her to go from a portfolio with a lower expected rate
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.840]   of return to a portfolio of a higher expected rate of return." And so we said, "Assume for a moment
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:26.640]   she's in a portfolio that has an expected rate of return of 4%, and she's paying 2% in fees and
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.160]   expenses, so her net return is 2%." Well, I plugged that 2% number in, and I demonstrated to my
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:38.560]   listener that under that scenario, her portfolio value in about 30 years would be $1.8 million
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:47.520]   for her heirs. But then I said, "Let's assume that we could move her from a portfolio that would
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.920]   have an expected rate of return of 4% into a portfolio with an expected rate of return of,
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:59.280]   say, 8%, and yet she's also going to still pay 2% of expenses, so her net return would be 6%.
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:05.360]   And so the same calculation, $1 million growing over 30 years at 66% per year,
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:12.240]   comes out to be $5.7 million." And I explained to the listener, I said, "That would be, if I were
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.400]   auditioning for the job of her financial advisor, that would be what I would focus on. And then
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.200]   through good financial planning, I would try to solve her income needs. I would try to educate
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:28.880]   her about investments so that she could be competent and knowledgeable enough to feel
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.040]   comfortable with that portfolio, and I would try to move her into that portfolio that has a higher
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.920]   expected rate of return so that she could potentially leave behind $5.7 million for
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.400]   those she wants to leave the money to, rather than $1.8 million." I'm going to stop here and
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:52.320]   ask you a question. Thus far in what I have said to you, what's missing? What's missing?
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:05.680]   Can you spot what's missing? The answer is, what's missing is, what if she could both solve
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:12.320]   her financial planning needs, etc., so that she was comfortable moving to a higher returning
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:21.200]   investment, and also eliminate or reduce her financial advice fees to lower the expenses
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:28.240]   on her portfolio? Because it's not just option one or option two. She does have more options.
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.240]   Option one would be she could stay where she is and make a net 2% rate of return,
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:38.480]   have $1.8 million. Option two was she could move into a portfolio with a higher expected return,
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:42.800]   and thus potentially generating for herself a portfolio of $5.7 million.
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:50.480]   But there are many more options. A simple option three would be, what if she could move into that
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:59.360]   same portfolio with an expected return of 8%, but let's pretend that she could completely eliminate
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.280]   financial advisor fees? Because of course she could, if she didn't need the services of a
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:08.800]   financial advisor or want the services of a financial advisor, she could completely eliminate
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:16.960]   those fees. Now let's run it at 8%. Do you know what the number is on that million dollar portfolio?
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.960]   The number is $10,062,000. Let's call that $10 million among friends.
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:32.960]   So the full and complete analysis of that situation would be that a bad financial advisor
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:41.600]   who's keeping her in a low performing portfolio because that financial advisor is bowing to her
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:47.840]   conservative tendencies and not educating her on the value of growing this portfolio for her heirs
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:52.640]   is potentially costing her the difference between $1.8 and $5.7 million. Let's call that $3 million
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:07:02.160]   among friends. So the bad financial advisor is costing her $3 million. But that doesn't mean
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:08.800]   that the financial advisor, if they're still charging her 1.7%, is not also costing her money.
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:18.160]   Because the difference between a 6% return and an 8% return is an additional $5 million.
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:27.520]   Now question, when I was going over that Q&A call yesterday, did you hear that omission?
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:34.800]   Did you think about that omission? Were you aware that there were more alternatives?
[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:42.480]   Most people, the answer is no. So let me give you a tool that I think is very useful,
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:49.920]   that I use all the time, to try to smoke out some of these answers when you are consulting
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:53.600]   with people. Here it is, it's a simple question.
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:08:00.560]   After listening to me and understanding a little bit about my situation,
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:06.240]   is there anything that you think I should ask that I haven't asked you yet?
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:12.160]   Are there any questions that you think I should be asking that you think would be helpful to me?
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:17.520]   Is there any information that I haven't considered that you think I should be considering?
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:25.600]   Those are all variations on the same theme. But put your advisor in the context
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:30.960]   of answering that question and give them a chance to tell you,
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:36.240]   "Well, based upon my professional experience, what you should be asking is this."
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:41.520]   Is that question going to solve all your problems and make sure that you're always getting full
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:47.760]   and comprehensive advice? Of course not. But a lot of times an advisor, a professional advisor,
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:56.080]   will know about things that you don't know about. But the advisor knows that most people
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:00.640]   aren't interested and so they keep their mouth shut. It's not necessarily out of malice,
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:07.600]   certainly I'm sure that some percentage of the population is filled with crooks and thieves who
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:13.600]   are omitting information out of malice. Certainly, there are many times that psychological tactics
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:18.640]   and tools are used and the omission of information is part of an intentional plan to rip people off.
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:25.120]   I believe that. But in my experience, that's just not the case most of the time. Most of the time,
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:31.680]   what happens is an advisor learns that most people don't actually care about a full and
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:38.960]   complete answer. And so they just learn to answer the question that's asked and not to offer more
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:45.840]   reasons, especially if they're dealing with a customer. If I'm selling Toyotas,
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:51.680]   do I have any reason to try to talk up all of the benefits of a Chevrolet?
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:10:00.240]   Is that my duty? I don't think it is usually. And so if I were selling Toyotas, usually I would say,
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:06.080]   "Here's what makes a Toyota great." And I would just focus on that. I wouldn't talk down about
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:10.240]   a Chevrolet, but it's not my job to go and present all of the potential alternatives to you.
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:15.280]   But if you were to ask me, as a Toyota salesman, something along the lines of,
[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:19.520]   "You know, after our conversations, is there anything that you think is important to me?"
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:23.840]   "Is there anything that you think I should be considering that I haven't considered?"
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:29.760]   That gives me a chance very easily to say, "You know, you mentioned to me that you have this
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:33.840]   particular need, and I think you should seriously consider this. The Toyota is really good in this,
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:37.760]   but I'll tell you what, Chevrolet has this particular car that has this certain benefit.
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:42.320]   I think you should consider it." A question like that gives honest people a chance
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:47.760]   to give you more information. And you can use this to your benefit.
[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:55.200]   I hope you'll try it out, and I hope it will use it. I hope it will help you to get better value
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:11:00.960]   from the people that you're interacting with. So in summary, thing number one, always look for
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:06.000]   additional opportunities. Now you can't do this to an endless degree. At some point in time,
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.400]   you've got to make a decision. But if you're trying to decide between option one and option two,
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:17.920]   ask yourself this question, "What other options am I not considering? What other things am I not
[00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:22.800]   considering? What's my alternative choice of action?" And just try to brainstorm about other
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:27.840]   ways that you might be able to accomplish your goals. Because there probably are other ways,
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:31.680]   but you might not be looking at them, you might not be thinking about them, and you probably don't
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:36.320]   know what you don't know. In order to overcome that gap, you're going to need the advice of an
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:41.600]   expert. But you have to learn how to get information out of an expert. And one of the most
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:48.160]   useful questions that I have developed to get information out of an expert is to ask an open
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:55.920]   ended pointed question, such as, "If you were in my shoes, what questions would you be asking
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:12:02.320]   that I've neglected?" Or, "What questions would you be asking because you know more than I do?
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:07.440]   What should I be asking that I haven't asked you about? What do I not know to ask about?"
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:15.280]   And it's my hope that asking that question will help you to smoke out some additional alternatives
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:20.560]   that might also serve you. At the end of the day, you've got to decide. You've got to collect
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:24.720]   options, and you've got to choose. And you're never going to make a perfect choice. There is
[00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:30.480]   no such thing as a perfect choice. But you want to make a good choice. And so fully consider
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:37.440]   as many alternatives as you can and try to get experts working for you effectively.
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:43.840]   With Kroger Brand products from Ralphs, you can make all your favorite things this holiday season.
