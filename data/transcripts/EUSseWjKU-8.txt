[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.320]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:15.000]   the Gospel according to St. Matthew in chapter 11 and reading verses 21 and 28.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   Verses 21 and 28 in the 11th chapter of the Gospel according to St. Matthew.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:32.720]   Woe unto thee, Chorazin! Woe unto thee, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works which were done in
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:39.360]   you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.640]   and ashes.
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:53.120]   Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:01:00.400]   I really want to take a phrase out of the 21st verse and a phrase out of the 28th verse.
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:08.240]   Woe unto you! Come unto me.
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:16.080]   Now I take these two phrases like this together and put them into juxtaposition in order that
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:23.840]   I may direct your thoughts and minds and attentions this evening to the very vitals and fundamentals
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.520]   of the Christian faith.
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:33.840]   These are strange words. They seem to be utterly contradictory, and yet they were spoken by
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:41.960]   the same person. Not to the same people, but by the same person.
[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.920]   I have many reasons, as I say, for calling your attention to them and for taking them
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:55.520]   together. They come together in this chapter. I take them together in order that I may show
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:03.000]   you certain things. The first is this. They do, after all, represent a very perfect summary
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.960]   of the great message of the Christian gospel. The Christian message is a kind of ellipse,
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:19.000]   and it has two points. And here, in these two phrases, we have those two points. Woe
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:30.240]   unto you! Come unto me. And the whole of the gospel is within that ellipse. I call attention
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:37.960]   to it because it seems to me that more than ever we need to have a clear understanding
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:46.520]   as to what the message of the gospel really is. The confusion is appalling.
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.680]   But here it is. It's summarized for us. Here it is coming out of his very lips and
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:03:01.720]   mouth. Woe unto you! Come unto me. Very well, I want to show you that it does, then, summarize
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:09.480]   the essential message of the gospel. I call attention to it also because, in a very striking
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:19.240]   and almost terrible manner, it brings home to us the seriousness of what you and I are
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:25.320]   doing together at this very moment. The most serious thing a man ever does in this
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:32.320]   world is to listen to the gospel. There is nothing which is in any way comparable to
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.800]   listening to the gospel, or, if you like, to reading the gospel, but particularly to
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:43.000]   listening to it, because it is through the preaching of the word that God has ordained
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.760]   that his kingdom is to be extended. Now, we listen to many voices in this world,
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:56.280]   and it's right that we should do so. We're going to have a general election, and we shall
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.680]   listen to many addresses. We may be addressed in public meetings, we may be addressed on
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.440]   the wireless and on the television. And it's all right, and it's important that we should
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.720]   listen, and we should all take an intelligent interest in these matters. It's important,
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:18.600]   then, I say, that we should listen to all these things. But, however important all that
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:26.160]   may be, it pales into insignificance when you put it side by side with what you are
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.400]   doing at this very moment, listening to a proclamation of this gospel.
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:37.280]   Why? Why do I say that this is the most serious thing and the most important thing that men
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:43.440]   and women can ever do? Well, our Lord himself supplies the answer, you see. You listen to
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.320]   the statesmen and the politicians, I say it's right that you should do so, because your
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.800]   future welfare depends upon it. The amount of money you have depends upon it. The houses
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.480]   you may have depend upon it. The whole future of the country may depend upon it. Whether
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:03.440]   we have war or not may depend upon it. These questions, these political questions, are
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.320]   not only relevant, but they're very important. They're going to determine how we are to spend
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:15.440]   our life in this country during the next five years.
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:21.800]   But my dear friend, what you're listening to at this moment isn't only going to determine
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.440]   what your life's going to be for the next five years, it's going to determine what your
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:33.400]   life's going to be forever and forever, your eternal destiny. It's our Lord who says that
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.640]   I don't say that. I want to show you in a moment how he says it. But what he's really
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:43.760]   saying here is this, and he brings it out, you see, in these words, "He that hath ears
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:58.040]   to hear, let him hear." As you listen to this gospel, your eternal destiny is being decided.
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:05.800]   There is nothing that is in any way comparable to listening to this gospel.
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:11.840]   And then the third reason I have for taking these two phrases together is this, that they
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:19.760]   help us to understand why it is that mankind is divided about this person who uttered the
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:29.440]   two phrases. They are divided about him, and he divides them. He said himself, he said,
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:36.880]   "Think not that I am come to bring peace on earth. I came not to bring peace, but a sword."
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:41.320]   And he says that the effect of his message will be to divide, perhaps, between mother
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:47.560]   and daughter, father and son, even husband and wife. There has never been a dividing
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:53.680]   force in this world in any way comparable to the gospel. It is a mighty sword that divides
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:07:00.120]   men and women into two groups. You're either in the group corresponding to Chorazin, Bethsaida,
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:07.000]   Capernaum, the people on whom he pronounces a woe, or else you belong to these other people
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.440]   to whom he addresses his gracious invitation.
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:17.520]   Now, you see, all that is put before us immediately. Here I say are two essentially different statements.
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:27.840]   "Woe, come!" Made by the same person, but made to different people. And this is the
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:34.520]   great question. Why is it that the effect of his coming is to divide? How is it that
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:41.520]   it's possible for one person, the same person, to utter two statements which on the surface
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:47.680]   seem to be not only different, but almost contradictory? Very well then, my dear friends,
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:53.520]   you see, this is a very momentous matter. So let me put it like this to you at this
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:58.880]   moment. The vital question for every one of us at this second is this. Which of these
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:05.560]   two groups do you belong to? You're in one or the other. There's no other possibility.
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:10.440]   There are but two divisions. Here they are. I ask, which of the two groups do you belong
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:17.880]   to? What is the Son of God saying to you? What has he said to you? It's one or the
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:24.400]   other of these two. There is nothing, I say, in the whole world tonight which is comparable
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:36.760]   to this question. What is the Son of God saying to you? This then, I say, is so important
[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:43.640]   that we must look at it and analyze it and consider it carefully together. And let's
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:51.360]   do it like this. Who is this person who speaks in this way and manner? Here is the first
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:56.440]   great question, obviously. People may say to me, you say we're doing something tremendously
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:09:00.640]   important tonight, more important than anything else. You say it's more important that we
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:05.360]   should listen to this person than to anybody, great statesman, greatest statesman the world
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:09.720]   has ever known. Why do you say that? On what grounds do you say that? Why should we listen
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:15.520]   to him? The people are outside the churches tonight because they obviously don't believe
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:20.920]   what we believe about this person. Before you take the words, you've got to take the
[00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:27.760]   person who utters the words. And indeed, he compels you to do so. He says, "Come unto
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:34.760]   me." Well, that's a staggering thing to say. But of course, it is typical and characteristic
[00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:40.200]   of what he says everywhere. Now, here is the great cause of confusion today, it seems to
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:48.080]   me. The question is, what think ye of Christ? And I am simply here to say this, that we
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:56.320]   must take him as he is. What else can you do? What other authority have you for doing
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:02.200]   anything else? He must be taken as he is. And the confusion arises because men and women
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:06.520]   won't take him as he is. They take certain things about him that they like and they ignore
[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:10.560]   the others. And then others perhaps do the exact opposite, but they're both equally
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:16.120]   guilty. He must be taken as he is, he must be taken as a whole. And this, of course,
[00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:21.640]   is the great cause of trouble. Who is this person? Now, did you notice in the reading
[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:29.160]   just now how, in a sense, the whole of this chapter deals with this one question as to
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:36.400]   who this person is? Even a man like John the Baptist, great prophet as he was, the last
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:41.800]   of the great succession of prophets. Even he, probably as the result of imprisonment
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:46.920]   and ill health and suffering and weakness, even he got into a certain amount of confusion
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:51.600]   about this. In the prison he heard the works of Christ and he sent two of his disciples
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:11:01.600]   asking this question, "Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another? Are you the
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:07.720]   long-promised Messiah, or are you not?" John was in confusion, so he sends and asks his
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:14.360]   famous question. And these other statements, these other paragraphs in this chapter are
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:21.480]   all indicative of the same thing. This confusion. Our Lord says, "Whereunto shall I liken this
[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:25.200]   generation? It is like children sitting at the market and calling to their fellows and
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:28.920]   saying, 'We have piped unto you and ye have not danced, we have mourned unto you and ye
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:33.360]   have not lamented.' John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, 'Ye have the devil.'
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:38.800]   Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, 'Behold, a man gluttonous and a wine-bibber,
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:44.960]   a friend of publicans and sinners.'" Confusion concerning him. That was the trouble in Chorazin,
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:51.520]   Bethsaida, and Capernaum. It's the trouble always. Who is this? Why should we listen
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:59.400]   to him? And it is, of course, the fundamental question. And I say there's only one way to
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:08.000]   approach it, and that is to listen to him, to take him as he is, as a whole, and you'll
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:17.200]   find some surprising things. You'll find severity. "Woe unto you," he says, and there's nothing
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:24.080]   more severe than that. But then you find, on the other hand, incomparable gentleness.
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:29.400]   He's always been an enigma to the men of this world because of these apparent contradictions.
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:37.960]   Severity, gentleness. Authority and majesty. Lowliness and meekness. But here it is, he
[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:45.760]   says, it's all a part of his person. These things are all elements in his character.
[00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:50.840]   And you find this, I say, not only here, but you find it everywhere in the Gospels. But
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:59.240]   look at him, my friend. Listen to this person who asks men and women to listen to him, who
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:05.840]   claims that he has the right to pronounce "woe," who doesn't hesitate to invite men and women
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:14.280]   to come unto him and to learn of him. He claims to be an authority on life and living. He
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:20.720]   says that he alone can give us peace and rest for our minds and hearts and souls. He tells
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:25.800]   us that if we follow him, we shall arrive at true life, life which is life indeed and
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:33.440]   life which is eternal. He claims equally definitely to be the judge of men, and that mankind's
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:41.200]   destiny depends solely and utterly and entirely upon their relationship to him. Who is this
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:48.520]   person? Well, fortunately for us, he has himself answered the question. Listen. At that time
[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:54.440]   Jesus answered and said, "I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:59.920]   hast hid these things from the wise and prudent and hast revealed them unto babes. Even so,
[00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:08.960]   O Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight then, all things are delivered unto me of
[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:18.680]   my Father. And no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father,
[00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:29.160]   save the Son. And he to whomsoever the Son willeth to reveal him." Here is the only
[00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:34.240]   answer. Look at him. Look at one side only, and leave out the rest, and you'll be an
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:39.640]   enigma and a problem because the rest always keeps on creeping in. Look at one facet only
[00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:43.720]   and you'll be in confusion. Look at him as a whole. Look at him in his entirety. Look
[00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:51.800]   at him as he is. And there's only one adequate explanation. He is none other than the only
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:58.600]   begotten Son of God. Here is one who doesn't hesitate to assert and to claim that it is
[00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:07.280]   he alone who knows the Father, and that no man can know the Father except he, the Son,
[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:13.920]   should reveal him to him. Now here is the staggering claim, and you read your four Gospels
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:18.880]   and you'll come to this conclusion, as has often been pointed out, that either this person
[00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:28.840]   I'm speaking here is a lunatic, or else he's the Son of God. He is either a raving madman.
[00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:35.320]   He is either the most arrogant person that this world has ever known, or he is indeed,
[00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:43.240]   as he claimed to be, the Son of God and the Savior of the world. Well, my friends, here
[00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:47.480]   is the great reason for listening to him. It's all right, as I've said, to listen to
[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:52.960]   men, to great men. Let's do so. Let's take every advantage that we have and every opportunity.
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:59.880]   But I say above all men, listen, here is the Son of God come down on earth, the one who
[00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:05.280]   claims that he is the light of the world, and that the destinies of every one of us
[00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:12.960]   and of the whole world is in his hands. That's who he is. Very well, having looked at the
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:19.400]   person, let us listen to what he says. And here we come again to the thing that is, of
[00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:27.200]   course, emphasized especially by the two phrases that I'm holding before you. And once more,
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:35.080]   it is absolutely essential that we should take the two statements together. Woe unto
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:47.800]   you! Come unto me! The threat, the judgment, the gracious, loving invitation.
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:54.040]   Now I have no hesitation in asserting that the greatest trouble at the present time is
[00:16:54.040 --> 00:17:01.000]   due to the fact that men and women will not take the two sides, the two statements. They
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.920]   won't realize that the gospel is an ellipse. They say there's only one message in it. They
[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:11.480]   pick out one of the two statements only and they ignore the other. The popular teaching
[00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:18.840]   today is that the message of the gospel is only the second. Come unto me! This is what's
[00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:23.160]   being preached, this is what's being written and published in books and in articles. This
[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:29.680]   is the common idea. They say that it's impossible that he should have said the other thing.
[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:34.600]   They say these two things are mutually contradictory and exclusive. You can't get a person who
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:38.760]   says come unto me and who preaches the love of God, you can't get such a person saying
[00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:44.280]   woe and pronouncing judgment. The thing they say is a blank contradiction. You don't have
[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:49.000]   wrath and love in the same person and at the same time. There's something wrong here, they
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.440]   say. These people who wrote the gospels, they misunderstood him and that's been the cause
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:57.200]   of the trouble. That's the view, you see. They sit in judgment of the scriptures, they
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:03.880]   say there's only one message, it's the message of love. And they say that the love of God
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:12.320]   is something that is unthinkable in terms of wrath. They say this is just a contradiction.
[00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:19.720]   And they say that to suggest that God, the God of love, is capable of judgment and wrath
[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:25.960]   and indignation and can punish anybody eternally, they say it is impossible. Indeed, some of
[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:31.600]   them are blasphemous in what they do say. They say that they don't believe in that bully
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:39.000]   of the Old Testament. They don't believe in the God of Sinai, the God of Moses. They only
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.800]   believe, they say, in the God of the New Testament, as if there were a contradiction between the
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:47.920]   two. You see, they say come unto me, that's the message. There's not a word here about
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:54.600]   woe unto you. It's impossible, they say, it is unthinkable. The popular idea today is
[00:18:54.600 --> 00:19:02.080]   that God loves everybody, and that God will love everybody. What they're writing in their
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:09.360]   books is this. I could give you the titles, but I don't want to advertise them. What they
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:14.400]   say is this, that the tragedy of the world, the tragedy of mankind is that mankind doesn't
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:19.880]   know that God loves them. But they say whether they know it or not, God still loves them.
[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:24.080]   And everybody's going to heaven, and everybody's going to happiness and to glory. You see,
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:28.120]   the whole business of preaching is just to tell people not to be so stupid, not to be
[00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:33.640]   so foolish, but to realize that God does love them. And he'll love them even though they
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:39.280]   spit in his face, even though they deny him, he'll still love them. God loves everybody,
[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:47.560]   and that's all we need to know. Come unto me, it's the only message. That's the position.
[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:53.640]   They don't believe that he ever said, "Woe unto you." Well, now then, my friends, what
[00:19:53.640 --> 00:20:00.920]   about this? It's rather important, isn't it? We don't have an endless leash on life in
[00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:06.480]   this world. You can't afford to take a risk on a matter like this. How do we decide this
[00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:14.200]   matter? Well, let me ask a question. Who decides? Who decides? Does he decide, or do you decide?
[00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:18.920]   What I'm holding before you tonight is not an isolated text. You read your four Gospels,
[00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:24.000]   you'll find he keeps on saying it. These two notes run right through the whole of his teaching
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:33.760]   from beginning to end. The question comes simply down to this. Is he your authority?
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:40.080]   Or are you your own authority? Is modern man your authority, and his ideas of God and what
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:45.280]   the love of God should be like? It's one or the other, and it's such a tremendous question
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:50.760]   that I press it upon your consideration. If you say that there's only one side of this
[00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:57.440]   message and not the other, how do you know that? What authority have you for saying it?
[00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:04.120]   But wait a minute. I want to try to show you that not only are these two elements here
[00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:09.800]   and absolutely essential, but that there is no question of any contradiction whatsoever
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:15.600]   between them. Indeed, I want to go further and to say this, that if you don't have the
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:22.120]   two, you haven't got your Gospel. You cannot really understand the Gospel, the message
[00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:27.840]   of the New Testament, unless you take in these two elements. Let me put it like this to you.
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:33.280]   Here is a great book called the Bible, and yet you know it's divided into two sections,
[00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:39.280]   isn't it? Old Testament, New Testament. What's Old Testament and New Testament? It's just
[00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:45.600]   another way of saying, "Woe unto you and come unto me." What's the Old Testament?
[00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:53.440]   Oh, it's the law. What's the New Testament? It's the Gospel. And the law is something
[00:21:53.440 --> 00:22:01.640]   that pronounces judgment. It enunciates woe. "The whole world lieth guilty before God,"
[00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:06.960]   says the law. "By the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight."
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:11.320]   All have sinned and come short of the glory of God. That's the law, and the whole of
[00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:19.040]   the New Testament is proclaiming this. And then there comes this gracious message, "Oh
[00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:23.400]   yes, there are adumbrations of it in the Old, there are prophecies concerning it, but the
[00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:34.240]   great thrust of the Old is law, woe, denunciation, condemnation." The law was our schoolmaster,
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:41.040]   as Paul puts it to the Galatians, to lead us and to bring us to Christ.
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:46.560]   So you see, if you take out one or the other of these, you are violating this great unity
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:52.200]   in the Bible between the Old Testament and the New, and the law and the Gospel. Why do
[00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:56.120]   I say that we must have these two things? Well, I'm putting it like this to you. I
[00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:59.880]   don't understand this table and the bread and the wine unless I believe the two sides
[00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:07.440]   of this message. There's no meaning in it. This is nonsense. But if I take the two statements,
[00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:12.320]   the two phrases together, well then I have a full and an adequate understanding of this.
[00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:18.560]   Let me show you what it means. What is the message of the Gospel? Well, it's this.
[00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:22.680]   The Gospel doesn't just come to us and say, "Well now, God loves you, whatever you've
[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:26.480]   been, whatever you've done, it's all right, God loves you, you've nothing to worry about."
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:32.400]   That isn't what the Gospel says. How does the Gospel start? Well, you've got your summaries
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:36.840]   here in these various books. You'll find that the first preacher in the New Testament
[00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:41.320]   was John the Baptist. What did he preach? Did he just get up and tell people that God
[00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:47.120]   loved them all and that all was well? He didn't. He preached a baptism of repentance for the
[00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:54.720]   remission of sin. He warned people to flee from the wrath to come. That was his message.
[00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:59.440]   And when our Lord began to preach, he did exactly the same thing. Listen to Mark summarizing
[00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:05.000]   it in Mark 1 15. "Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee preaching
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:10.080]   the Gospel of the kingdom of God and saying, 'The time is fulfilled and the kingdom of
[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:17.740]   God is at hand. Repent ye and believe the Gospel.'" What did Peter preach on the day
[00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:23.400]   of Pentecost at Jerusalem? Wasn't it repentance? Under his tremendous preaching they cried
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:28.360]   out saying, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?" Back came the thundering reply, "Repent
[00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:35.760]   every one of you and believe on the Lord Jesus Christ." The Apostle Paul in that most lyrical
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:41.080]   twentieth chapter of the book of Acts saying farewell to the elders of the church at Ephesus,
[00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:46.880]   he reminds them that day and night with tears and without ceasing he had preached unto them
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:53.040]   what? The repentance that is toward God and the faith that is toward the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:57.280]   My friends, if you don't bring in these two things, you might as well throw your Bibles
[00:24:57.280 --> 00:25:05.440]   into the fire. You don't understand the Bible and its message apart from the two sides of
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:11.640]   this great and glorious Gospel. What is the message? Well, it's this I say. The first
[00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:21.080]   thing the Bible tells us is that men have sinned and that men is guilty. You don't
[00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:25.960]   understand the world as it is tonight if you don't believe that. Why is the world in
[00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:31.480]   this appalling muddle? Why is there such tragedy all round and about us? Why is everything
[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:36.400]   breaking down? There's only one answer. It's the old answer of the early part of Genesis.
[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:44.760]   Man's rebellion against God, man's sin, man's fall, man's guilt. That's why we're
[00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:49.000]   all unhappy. That's why we all know what remorse is. That's why we all suffer from
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:54.240]   the accusations of conscience, guilt. It's in us all. And the Bible tells us, yes, it's
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:59.720]   true, man has sinned. He has revolted against God. He's fallen from the position in which
[00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:06.840]   he was originally made and created. But you see, it doesn't stop at that. It tells us
[00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:15.660]   that God hates sin and that God's judgment upon sin is manifest. This is the old story
[00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:20.600]   of the human race, men created and put in paradise. He rebels and sins and falls. What
[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:26.480]   happens to him? He's turned out. God punishes him. He turned him out. He cursed the very
[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:31.520]   ground. Man's got to earn his bread by the sweat of his brow. And there he is still trying
[00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:36.800]   to do it and trying to get back, but he cannot. God manifested his judgment and his wrath.
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:41.680]   He pronounced his woe upon sin there away back at the beginning. And he's been doing
[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:50.480]   it ever since. That is what he was doing at the flood. That he was doing, that was what
[00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:55.640]   he was doing on that occasion to which our Lord refers here, when he destroyed Sodom
[00:26:55.640 --> 00:27:01.600]   and Gomorrah. God looked down and he saw the lives that were being lived in those cities
[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:07.440]   of the plain, the immorality, the vice, the sexual perversions, everything that Sodom
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:13.760]   stands for. He hated it and he pronounced a woe upon it and they were destroyed. Tyre
[00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:22.320]   and Sidon, exactly the same thing. God, right through the Old Testament, is pronouncing
[00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:27.280]   his judgment upon sin and giving expression to his abhorrence and his utter hatred of
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:32.820]   it. He punished even the children of Israel. He punished a favorite like David. He punishes
[00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:38.920]   anybody who sins against him. He says, "Woe is to the man who sins against me and violates
[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:45.240]   my law." God is a holy God. He is a righteous God. Sin he cannot tolerate. He said it from
[00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:49.840]   the beginning and the whole message of the Bible proclaims it and tells us that there
[00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:57.680]   shall be a final judgment, an ultimate assize, when everybody who has ever lived will stand
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:02.840]   before God and give an account of the deeds done in the body. Now, that's the great message
[00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:12.400]   of the Bible. Take that out, what have you got left? The Bible proclaims a holy God,
[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:22.320]   a just and a righteous God, a God who is light and in whom is no darkness at all. And he
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:28.720]   proclaims that the whole world lies guilty before him. Now, I say, you don't understand
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:32.760]   the Gospel unless you start with that, unless you believe that. Let me put it to you like
[00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:37.520]   this. The great message of this New Testament is that when the fullness of the times was
[00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:42.160]   come, God sent forth his Son made of a woman, made under the law to redeem them that are
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:47.360]   under the law. The glory and the marvel and the wonder of Bethlehem and the babe in the
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:55.320]   manger. But what's it all about? If this is the Son of God, why has he come? Why does
[00:28:55.320 --> 00:29:02.480]   he come into the world? What is he doing here? And he gave the answer repeatedly. He said,
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:10.800]   "The Son of Man is come to seek and to save that which is lost." He says, "The Son of
[00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:16.880]   Man is not come to be ministered unto, but to minister and to give his life a ransom
[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:21.840]   for many." What's he talking about? What does it mean? Why did the Son of God ever
[00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:25.080]   have to come into this world? What's he doing here? What's he mean by his teaching?
[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:32.840]   Oh, but let me ask a question. Why did he ever go to that cross? Why did he die on a
[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:38.320]   hill called Calvary? Well, listen to what he says. Some of his friends took out their
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:40.840]   swords and they said, "We're going to save you." He said, "This shan't happen.
[00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:44.640]   You put them back." He says, "Don't you know that I've come to do this?" "Don't
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:49.040]   you believe?" He says, "Don't you realize that if I wanted to escape it, I could easily
[00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:53.360]   commend twelve legions of angels and I could be wafted to heaven. There'd be no difficulty
[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:58.680]   at all. But I've come to die. How can I redeem? How can I fulfill all righteousness
[00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:08.840]   unless I do?" Why is the Son of God in the world? Why is his death an absolute necessity?
[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:14.840]   Why did he set his face steadfastly to go to Jerusalem in spite of the entreaties of
[00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:22.800]   his friends? And there's only one answer to the question. He came to deliver us from
[00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:31.440]   the wrath to come. He came to deliver us from the woe pronounced by a holy, righteous God
[00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:40.480]   in his holy law upon every sin and disobedience of men. What's the meaning of his coming,
[00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:46.680]   his life, his death, his resurrection? There's only one answer. It is God providing a way
[00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:56.800]   whereby he can still be the punisher of sin and yet the Savior of men. You don't understand
[00:30:56.800 --> 00:31:01.600]   the New Testament message, its history or its great teaching, unless you take these
[00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:08.000]   two sides together. It is because of the woe pronounced on men that Christ comes and Christ
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:13.080]   died. Something must be done to solve this problem and it's solved in him. And it's
[00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:23.640]   the only way in which it can be solved. God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself,
[00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:30.200]   not imputing their trespasses unto them. God in Christ has solved, if I may so put it,
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:37.760]   his own eternal problem. God is righteous and holy and true. God is also love and mercy
[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:45.000]   and compassion. Are these things in conflict? Is there a conflict in God? The thing is unthinkable.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:51.960]   God isn't only love. God isn't only righteousness. He's both. The two things are there in God,
[00:31:51.960 --> 00:32:00.240]   righteousness and love. And the great message of the Gospel is that in Christ Jesus there
[00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:05.800]   is this great answer. How can God remain just and forgive a sinner? The answer is in Christ
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:13.600]   and in crucified. Justice and love are reconciled. Mercy and truth are met together. Righteousness
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:21.400]   and peace have kissed each other. In this one person, the woe and the love and mercy
[00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:29.160]   and compassion are united. So he is able to stand and to say on the one hand, "Woe unto
[00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:37.040]   you and on the other, come unto me." In other words, our message is this, that salvation
[00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:46.080]   is offered freely in Jesus Christ and him crucified to all. He has come to die for the
[00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:54.800]   sins of men and salvation is offered. But isn't it obvious that if this is refused
[00:32:54.800 --> 00:33:02.920]   and rejected, we are left under the woe and under the curse? What if you'd only got your
[00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:08.680]   Old Testament? What if you'd got nothing but the law? You'd be damned, you'd be condemned,
[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:14.640]   you'd be lost. The message of the Old Testament is this, as I've reminded you, that by the
[00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:20.000]   deeds of the law shall no flesh be justified in his sight. The whole world lieth guilty
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:25.880]   before God. There is none righteous, no, not one. All have sinned and come short of the
[00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:34.560]   glory of God. What if you were left there? But here is the New Testament with its proclamation
[00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:40.080]   of the way of salvation in the Son of God who dies for us, lays down his life for us,
[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:46.640]   repairs our sins in his own body on the tree. God in his righteousness punishes sin in him
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:51.760]   and therefore offers us pardon. He offers it to you. It's the only way. God can't
[00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:59.320]   forgive except in this way. If there were another way, his Son would never have died.
[00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:04.480]   Do you think a God of love would ever have allowed his Son to suffer and endure what
[00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:12.280]   he endured and suffered on the cross on Calvary's Hill unless it were absolutely essential?
[00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:20.320]   He that spared not his own Son but delivered him up for us all. But don't you see, my
[00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:27.740]   dear friend, that if you reject that, if you reject the only way of salvation and of deliverance,
[00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:33.080]   you are left under the condemnation, you are left under the woe, you are left in the hopelessness
[00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:37.120]   and the helplessness of it all. That's why the two sides are essential. There's no
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:43.360]   contradiction here. They're both saying the same thing. There is the condemnation.
[00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:48.840]   He can deliver you from it. But if you refuse him, you remain under condemnation. Now then,
[00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:54.000]   he said all that himself very perfectly. You'll find it recorded of all places in what people
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:58.480]   seem to regard as their favorite chapter of the Bible, namely the third chapter of John's
[00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:07.480]   gospel. Listen to this. "He that believeth on him is not condemned, but he that believeth
[00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:13.640]   not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten
[00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:23.160]   Son of God." Listen again. "He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life, and he that
[00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:33.400]   believeth not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him." No,
[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:39.200]   no, my dear friend, there's no contradiction here. These two things are absolutely essential.
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:43.280]   You don't understand the one without the other. They're both proclaiming the same thing.
[00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:49.560]   The same person is the speaker. He's either the source of this gracious invitation to
[00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:56.480]   you, or else he's the pronouncer of the woe upon you. That's what he says. Very well,
[00:35:56.480 --> 00:36:00.280]   we've looked at the person and we've looked at what he says. Let me come to the next,
[00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:07.440]   the third point, which is this. I started by asking you a simple question. I said, "What
[00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:14.040]   is he saying to you? What has he said to you?" Which of these two things? So I now make this
[00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:25.240]   statement. What is it that determines what he does say to us? And the answer is here
[00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:31.240]   in this very chapter, perfectly, plainly, and clearly for us all to see. He always starts
[00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:38.280]   with a gracious invitation. He lived and did good. He worked miracles. He did acts of kindness.
[00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:42.360]   Look at him. He went about doing good. He was the friend of publicans and sinners. They
[00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:48.440]   said that about him themselves. He would spend his time with the outcasts. There was nothing
[00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:53.960]   that he wouldn't do. And he healed the sick and he lay the blind. Go and tell John again,
[00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:58.720]   he says, the things you've seen and heard. The blind received their sight and the lame
[00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:03.040]   walked. The lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear. The dead are raised up and the poor
[00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:07.560]   of the gospel preach to them. Oh, that's how he lived and that's how he spoke. Men
[00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:12.600]   went to listen to him and they were amazed at the gracious words that came out of his
[00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:16.960]   mouth. The Roman authorities sent soldiers to arrest him. They came back without him
[00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:22.240]   and they said, "Never men spake like this man. They never heard such wonderful, gracious,
[00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:27.360]   loving, kind things. That's how he always begins. And his deeds were deeds of mercy
[00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:37.800]   and of compassion." Well then, why did they reject him? Why did they crucify him? That's
[00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:44.840]   the question, isn't it? What is it that determines what he says to us? There's only one answer.
[00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:51.320]   It is our attitude to him. It is our reaction to what he is, to what he says, to what he
[00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:57.320]   does. Notice what I'm saying. It isn't your life that decides it. It isn't your
[00:37:57.320 --> 00:38:01.760]   deeds. It isn't your misdeeds. It isn't your sins. It isn't your vileness. It is
[00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:07.360]   one thing only. It is your attitude. That's the point that our Lord makes here. What's
[00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:12.320]   the matter with the cities of the plain? Well, he tells you, "Woe unto thee, Chorazin!
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:16.600]   Woe unto thee, Bethsaida!" These were the cities where in most of his mighty works were
[00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:22.320]   done. He says, "If the mighty works which were done in you had been done in Tyre and
[00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:27.480]   Sidon, they would have repented long ago in Sackcliffe and Eshes," and so on. Then he
[00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:32.920]   turns to his father and he says, "I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth,
[00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:39.640]   because thou hast hid these things from the wise and the prudent, and hast revealed them
[00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:44.520]   unto babes." What is it that determines what he says? Well, look at the cities of
[00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:49.360]   the plain and the people who lived in them. It's always the same thing. You see, he's
[00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:58.360]   been saying something like this before. "Wisdom," he says, "is justified of our children."
[00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:03.080]   These were the people who were always complaining. He compares them to children sitting in the
[00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:07.240]   market. "We have piped unto you, and you haven't danced. We have mourned unto you,
[00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:10.920]   and you haven't lamented. John the Baptist came neither eating nor drinking, and you
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:15.920]   said about him, 'He hath a devil.'" Now, and then I come, he says, "both eating and
[00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:23.800]   drinking." And you say, "Behold, a man gluttonous and a wine-bibber, a friend of publicans and
[00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:32.000]   sinners." Ah, well, he says, "Wisdom is justified of our children." What's it all
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:39.840]   about? My dear friends, it comes down as simply as this, to this one proposition. What makes
[00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:51.880]   him say, "Woe unto you," to any man, is pride, and nothing but pride, especially pride of
[00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:57.280]   intellect. I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast did these
[00:39:57.280 --> 00:40:08.040]   things from the wise, the prudent. Wisdom is justified of our children. The children
[00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:13.520]   of this world are wiser in their generation than the children of light. What was the matter
[00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:18.560]   with these people? Why didn't they believe in him in Chorazin and Bethsaida and in Capernaum?
[00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:25.560]   Oh, it was because of their wisdom. You see, they sat in judgment on him. They looked on.
[00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:30.680]   They felt that they were critics. They could criticize John the Baptist. They could criticize
[00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:37.560]   him. And they contradicted themselves hopelessly. John was an ascetic. He was a severe man.
[00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:43.200]   Camel hair shirt, locusts and wild honey. "Ah," they said, "this is impossible. We
[00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:47.720]   want somebody who's friendly and will mix with us." Jesus Christ mixed with the outcasts,
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:52.880]   the publicans and sinners. And they said, "This man's a glutton. He's a wine-bibber.
[00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:57.880]   He's a friend of publicans and sinners. Look at the company he keeps. This man is immoral.
[00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:02.920]   This man is vile. Whatever is done for them, it's all wrong." But you see, their wise
[00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:09.520]   wisdom is justified of their children. Oh, they were self-confident. They were assured.
[00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:15.840]   They sat in judgment upon him. And that is why he pronounces his woe upon them. Why does
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:23.120]   he pronounce woe on them? Well, I'll summarize it like this. They never realized who he was.
[00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:29.160]   They thought he was only a man. A man for them to evaluate and to criticize and to say
[00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:37.360]   he's right here and wrong there. That's the man to whom he says, "Woe is unto you."
[00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:46.600]   The wise men of this world, the men who think he knows and understands, the men who doesn't
[00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:52.040]   realize the significance of the coming of the Son of God into this world. He's a very
[00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:56.520]   clever man, of course. He reads his Sunday newspapers. He reads the books. He's an expert
[00:41:56.520 --> 00:42:01.680]   in politics. He's wonderful in business. Oh, he's a wise man. The wisdom of this world,
[00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:06.960]   wisdom is justified of all her children. Oh, he's wise. But he looks into the face of the
[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:14.000]   Son of God and he turns away. They didn't realize that heaven, as it were, was walking
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:20.600]   amongst them. And they didn't see the significance of his works. He did these mighty works, these
[00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:25.840]   shattering works, these powerful works, works such as no man had ever worked before. Even
[00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:32.160]   then, even these didn't change them. Even these didn't impress them. They were too
[00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:37.760]   wise. They tried to explain these things away. They didn't believe in miracles and so on
[00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:42.040]   and so forth. They didn't understand him. They didn't understand his works. But as
[00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:47.360]   he puts it, "The ultimate cause of the charge, you see, is this." Then began he to upraise
[00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:56.360]   the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done because they repented not. In their
[00:42:56.360 --> 00:43:00.760]   wisdom they didn't need him and they didn't need his help. They resented his teaching.
[00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:04.920]   He made them feel uncomfortable. His teaching made them feel that they were sinners. The
[00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:08.960]   Pharisees and scribes, they hated him for that reason. And all the wise people of the
[00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:14.360]   world did to the Greeks. The gospel has always been unutterable foolishness and folly, laughable,
[00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:19.760]   ridiculous, blood of Christ, this, fancy believing something like that, a wrath of God and hell.
[00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:29.440]   Ah, what a joke it is. The wise men of this world, they don't want him. They've never
[00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:36.120]   seen any need of him. They could look into the face of the Son of God and not feel that
[00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:42.240]   they were utterly vile and foul. They were never broken. They never realized what sinners
[00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:46.280]   they were. They never realized how desperate they were. They never realized how hopeless
[00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:52.080]   they were. They never had any sorrow for sin. They never felt shame that made them almost
[00:43:52.080 --> 00:44:00.720]   commit suicide at times because of their vileness and their unworthiness. They never felt that
[00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:06.840]   there was any need for the Son of God to come into the world. They were self-satisfied.
[00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:15.040]   They were self-sufficient. They were self-contained. And it was because of that he said, "Woe
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:22.120]   unto you." What else could he say to them? But look at the other side to this equation,
[00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:29.040]   if you like to so put it. To other people he says, "Come unto me." To whom does he
[00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:34.800]   say this? Well, he's already put it in these words, "I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven
[00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:41.360]   and earth, because thou hast did these things from the wise and prudent and hast revealed
[00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:59.320]   them unto babes." Babes. "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and
[00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:06.480]   I will give you rest." Labour, heavy laden. Who are these? Oh, these are people who realize
[00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:12.080]   they're just babes. They don't get intoxicated because we've split the atom and say, "I'm
[00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:16.800]   a twentieth century man. I've grown. I'm of age. I've come up to the stature that men
[00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:20.800]   should have." "Oh, I've got knowledge. I've got wisdom. I've got the..." I don't believe
[00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:27.800]   what people believed a thousand and two thousand years ago. No, no. This man says, "I'm only
[00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:34.320]   a babe. I've got this knowledge, but it doesn't help me. I don't understand myself. I don't
[00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:41.600]   understand life. I feel I'm terribly ignorant. I don't know what it's all about. I don't
[00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:48.840]   understand death, what lies beyond it. I don't know. I just don't know. I'm a babe. I'm an
[00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:53.160]   ignoramus. All this knowledge that people burst about, it doesn't answer my deepest
[00:45:53.160 --> 00:46:03.560]   questions. I don't know. I'm lost. I want light. I want knowledge. I want help. And I'm
[00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:11.560]   fighting a terrible and a losing battle. I am laboring and I'm heavy laden. I've got
[00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:17.680]   a terrible load of my past sins upon my shoulders, and it's almost crushing me to the ground.
[00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:23.760]   I've sinned and sinned and sinned. I've promised myself never to sin again. I've done it again.
[00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:29.400]   I've promised God never to sin again. I've sinned again. I'm laboring. I've got a heavy
[00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:38.520]   load. I'm heavy laden. I'm crushed. And yet I find the more I attempt, the more I fail.
[00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:48.440]   I'm a complete moral failure. I'm a completely helpless person. I see the task. I see I believe
[00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:54.200]   in God I would live a holy life, but I can't. I haven't got the power. I'm suffering from
[00:46:54.200 --> 00:47:00.840]   a kind of spiritual indignation. I'm laboring. I'm heavy laden. I don't know what to do with
[00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:09.880]   myself. I'm falling. I'm fainting. I'm failing. I'm a babe in understanding. I'm an utter
[00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:16.240]   and a complete failure in the great business of life and living and the moral fight. And
[00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:21.120]   I don't know how to die, and I'm afraid of it and afraid of what lies beyond it. I don't
[00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:30.800]   know where I am. What can I do? God have mercy upon me a sinner. And you know the moment
[00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:35.600]   the man said that, you know what happened? He heard a voice, the sweetest voice he'd
[00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:42.880]   ever heard, whispering to him, "Come unto me. Come unto me, all ye that labor and are
[00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:51.080]   heavy laden, and I will give you rest." You see, what determines what he says is our attitude.
[00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:55.840]   It's our state of mind. It's our state of heart. It's our state of soul. Sit in judgment
[00:47:55.840 --> 00:48:00.560]   on him and say you don't need him and criticize him and put him in his place. There comes
[00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:13.680]   the thundering answer, "Raw to you." But recognize and acknowledge and feel your need.
[00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:19.240]   Reckon with your sin and shame and failure to God and cry out for mercy and compassion.
[00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:26.880]   Repent and the gracious invitation will come to you. "Come unto me," he will say. Very
[00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:33.080]   well my dear friends, let me, as I close, therefore, ask you again to listen to these
[00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:48.200]   two positions. There are only these two possibilities. You reject him and ignore him in your wisdom
[00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:56.800]   and understanding and knowledge. And on you will be pronounced this woe, our Lord says,
[00:48:56.800 --> 00:49:01.040]   judgment shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for
[00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:13.200]   you. There's a judgment coming and any man who dies in his sin goes on to endless, hopeless
[00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:27.000]   woe. More tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the judgment, it's coming. And if you
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:32.440]   reject him and if you fail to repent, even if you turn to him and try to turn to him
[00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:41.360]   in the next world, he will turn to you and say, "Depart from me." I never knew you.
[00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:51.360]   There is a great gulf fixed between you and me. That is one of his pronouncements, but
[00:49:51.360 --> 00:50:02.800]   I don't end with that. Listen to the other. "Come unto me," he says. Who's to come?
[00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:10.720]   Well, listen, this is his own answer. "Come unto me, all ye that are laboring and heavy
[00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:20.960]   limbed." All. It doesn't matter what you've been hitherto. It doesn't matter how you
[00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:28.560]   may have spent your past life. It doesn't matter at all. "All ye that labor and are
[00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:40.760]   heavy limbed." It doesn't matter how vile your sin, how putrid your soul. The Son of
[00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:45.800]   God looks at you tonight in your helplessness and hopelessness, if you are conscious of
[00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:52.240]   it and if you long for deliverance, and he says, "Let not conscience make you linger
[00:50:52.240 --> 00:51:01.920]   or of fitness fondly dream." All the fitness he requires is to see and to feel your need
[00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:08.200]   of him. Oh, what a blessed gospel. I, in the name of this Christ tonight, have authority
[00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:15.360]   to say this. The greatest blaggart that London has ever known may be listening in this congregation
[00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:20.520]   at this moment. You may be a thief, you may be a murderer, you may be an adulterer, you
[00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:24.800]   may be the vilest creature that has ever trod the face of the earth. I have authority to
[00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:30.480]   say this to you. Are you laboring? Are you heavy laden? Have you come to the end? Listen.
[00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:39.840]   He says this to you. "Come unto me." You are included in the invitation. "Today thy
[00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:49.600]   mercy calls us to wash away our sin, however great our trespass, whatever we may have been."
[00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:56.680]   It doesn't matter. "All ye that labor and are heavy laden, come!" The invitation is
[00:51:56.680 --> 00:52:04.880]   to you. It isn't your deeds that matter, it's the attitude that matters. Even Sodom
[00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:10.280]   and Gomorrah could have been saved if they had repented. There is hope for any man who
[00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:16.880]   repents and who humbles himself and falls at his feet and is ready to receive the invitation.
[00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:21.760]   And what does he give? Well, here it is. "Rest for your souls." What does it mean? Well,
[00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:25.920]   the end of their useless striving, the end of their unhappiness, the end of the fear
[00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:38.520]   of death and the grave and the judgment. Peace, rest. Oh, just the knowledge of sins forgiven,
[00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:45.200]   that though they wear a scarlet, they shall be as white as snow. Come unto him and he'll
[00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:50.320]   take you to this great book and he'll say, "There was what was set against you. It's
[00:52:50.320 --> 00:53:00.120]   all cancelled, it's wiped out, there's nothing against you." Rest for your soul. End of that
[00:53:00.120 --> 00:53:05.680]   useless striving to make yourself good and moral and clean and to justify yourself before
[00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:14.760]   God. End of all that. "So you say, not the labors of my hands can fulfill thy laws, demands
[00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:22.920]   could my zeal, no respite, no. Could my tears forever flow, all for sin could not atone.
[00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:29.800]   Thou must save and thou alone." And he'll give you new life on top of it. He'll teach
[00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:34.920]   you then, he says, "Take my yoke upon you and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in
[00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:39.920]   heart and you shall find rest for your souls." He says, "I won't leave you to yourself to
[00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:44.880]   fight the world, the flesh, the devil. You'll be yoked to me, my power will be in you. I'll
[00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:53.560]   redeem you, I'll keep you. I'll never leave you nor forsake you." And he'll keep you
[00:53:53.560 --> 00:54:02.800]   and he'll hold you all the way until he has finally presented you faultless without spot
[00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:09.880]   or wrinkle or any such thing to God his heavenly Father in the glory everlasting. Oh, my dear
[00:54:09.880 --> 00:54:19.320]   friend, can you refuse such an invitation? "Come," he says, "come unto me. You are vile
[00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:26.040]   and I am pure, but doesn't matter. Come, come unto me. I've died for your sins. I've cleared
[00:54:26.040 --> 00:54:32.040]   your debts. I've reconciled you to my Father. Come unto me. You can have rest and peace
[00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:38.560]   for your soul. Come unto me, weary, and I will give you rest." Oh, blessed voice of
[00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:46.440]   Jesus that comes to hearts oppressed. It tells of benediction, of pardon, love and
[00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:59.160]   peace, of joy which has no ending, of love which cannot cease. Have you heard it? Have
[00:54:59.160 --> 00:55:06.600]   you heard the gracious invitation? Are you humble? Are you a babe? Are you ignorant?
[00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:12.120]   Are you laboring? Are you heavy laden? Do you feel lost and forlorn and helpless and
[00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:20.040]   terrified of death and judgment? Is that it? Are you ready to listen? He says, "Come, come
[00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:30.240]   unto me. All ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." Have you heard
[00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:39.000]   him? Well, if you have, say this to him. "I hear thy gentle voice that calls me, Lord,
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:48.760]   to thee for cleansing in thy precious blood that flowed on Calvary. I am coming, Lord,
[00:55:48.760 --> 00:55:57.840]   coming now to thee. Wash me, cleanse me in the blood that flowed on Calvary." Say that
[00:55:57.840 --> 00:56:06.760]   to him. And then, for the rest of your life, this is what you'll say to everybody. You'll
[00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:12.240]   say, "Do you want to know why I am what I am? Do you want to know the explanation of
[00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:16.600]   the life I'm living? Do you want to know why I've got such joy? Do you want to know why
[00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:21.480]   I'm no longer afraid of death? Do you want to know why I am now able to conquer sins
[00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:30.320]   that always used to defeat me? Do you know the explanation?" It's this. "I heard the
[00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:42.120]   voice of Jesus say, 'Come unto me and rest. Lay down, thou weary one, lay down thy head
[00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:56.400]   upon my breast.' I came to Jesus as I was, weary and worn and sad. I found in him a resting
[00:56:56.400 --> 00:57:09.360]   place, and he hath made me glad. Come unto me, all ye that are weary and laboring and
[00:57:09.360 --> 00:57:23.680]   heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Blessed be God, for so great and glorious a salvation
[00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:33.720]   to hell-deserving sinners." Amen.
[00:57:33.720 --> 00:57:42.040]   Let us sing that great hymn of voracious Bonner, hymn number 376, "I heard the voice of Jesus
[00:57:42.040 --> 00:58:04.280]   say, 'Come unto me and rest.'"
[00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:20.840]   I heard the voice of Jesus say, "Come unto me and rest." Lay down, thou weary one, lay
[00:58:20.840 --> 00:58:40.520]   down thy head upon my breast. I came to Jesus as I was, weary and worn and sad. I found
[00:58:40.520 --> 00:58:53.160]   in him a resting place, and he hath made me glad.
[00:58:54.120 --> 00:59:14.600]   I heard the voice of Jesus say, "Behold my feet, the deep and the floaty rock, the rock
[00:59:14.600 --> 00:59:36.040]   of great mercy." I came to Jesus as I was, weary and worn and sad. I found in him a
[00:59:36.040 --> 00:59:54.280]   resting place, and he hath made me glad. I came to Jesus as I was, weary and worn and
[00:59:54.280 --> 01:00:22.920]   sad. I found in him a resting place, and he hath made me glad.
[01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:45.240]   I found in him a resting place, and he hath made me glad.
[01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:55.240]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
