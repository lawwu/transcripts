[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.840]   I'm Cal Newport and this is Deep Questions, episode 185.
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:20.300]   I'm here in my Deep Work HQ along with my producer, Jesse.
[00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.960]   We were just rock and rolling here briefly.
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.760]   There's some music blaring, I would say, from the restaurant below.
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.840]   So we're really feeling the groove.
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.560]   I don't think it'll show up on our recording because of the heavy gating we have, but it's
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.880]   going to give us a beat to bounce to.
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.760]   They're having a good time down there.
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:41.760]   They are.
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.680]   They didn't invite us, but I'm glad they are having a good time.
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:50.180]   This is a pretty eccentric studio we record in because we just had an audio engineer out
[00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:57.440]   here last week helping us get rid of this ringing that was picking up in the equipment.
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:04.280]   And it turned out that the building itself has a faulty ground.
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.360]   If you don't properly ground the electrical system in a building, the wires become antennas.
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:16.040]   So this entire building is basically RF emitting antennas or RF gathering antennas.
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.820]   I mean, Joe was able to take a, what do you call it, impedance booster and plug it onto
[00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.360]   our mic cable and we could hear AM radio in our headsets because the wire on the mic was
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.360]   acting as an antenna and the sound was coming in.
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:38.160]   So we have our whole building is an antenna and there's techno music playing.
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.120]   And then the third fun thing is, as it took Jesse a while to get used to this, weird smell
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.120]   Fridays.
[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:50.160]   Like every once in a while, just weird smells come from the kitchen below and fill the studio.
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:55.220]   Like I don't think in good conscience we could have former president Barack Obama come be
[00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.720]   interviewed in here.
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:57.720]   This would be my concern.
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.560]   I was going to suggest he might need to get a cleaning lady, but then I realized it wasn't,
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.360]   it was from coming from downstairs.
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.560]   I don't know if that's better or worse.
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.560]   Yeah.
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.120]   So anyways, it's, we, we love the HQ.
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.720]   It's an odd HQ.
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.800]   We've made some progress on the ringing.
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.640]   Joe the engineer did some stuff that I think got rid of it.
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.960]   So I think we're, I think we're okay, but he felt very tentative about it.
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.600]   You could tell someone at his caliber of audio engineering was very uncomfortable about the
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.000]   idea of trying to record anything high end in this location.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.760]   I think it made him physically uncomfortable.
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.240]   Well you should explain to the audience about, cause you do everything in one take and how
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:45.040]   you were hearing this ringing in the back of your mic or headphones while you were recording.
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.040]   Yeah.
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.040]   So I could hear it.
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.040]   Right.
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.040]   So we do things one take.
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.280]   So I could hear it going on.
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.040]   But then once the podcasts were going out, podcast listeners weren't hearing it so much.
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.760]   And I, and I think it's because there's so much of the high end frequencies are cut off
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:06.280]   in the compression for the podcast apps and then going through the wireless connection
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.320]   to earbuds that like most people listening didn't really hear it.
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.760]   But then as soon as we got on YouTube, people listen to YouTube on computers and I think
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.200]   the sound is less compressed.
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.260]   They could hear it.
[00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.000]   And we started hearing from people, Hey, what's that?
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   What's that ringing?
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   What's that?
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   What's that humming?
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.080]   So, so basically he did a bunch of stuff.
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.080]   I don't understand it.
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.360]   The ringing is gone.
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.640]   We have a hiss instead, but we have filters in place in theory to take care of the hiss
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:29.680]   before you hear it.
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.520]   So we're, we really got a top of the line location going here.
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.080]   I mean, I think Jesse, the only answer is we have to build a building somewhere.
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.880]   And I think the power company is going to come out or the power company could fix the
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.040]   power in this room.
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.200]   But I like our second option of we build the building built from the ground up with like
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:53.080]   a beautiful power supply and a completely soundproofed, perfectly soundproofed the walls.
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.880]   And so we can, we can dream.
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.000]   And if we do that, we have to get Joe the engineer somehow we have to steal him away
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.280]   because he was fantastic and yeah, he helps solve their problems.
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:10.880]   So anyways, this is the wonders of sort of semi-professional audio recording.
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.000]   All the wonders that we get to deal with, but I am glad to have that ringing gone because
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.240]   I mean, Jesse knows I'd complain about it.
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.920]   I was like, I can hear this thing.
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.120]   It's like a golfer, like having a tick on the back of his swing or something like, you
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.120]   know, equipment.
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.120]   So yeah, yeah.
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.320]   Because you're hearing it while you're recording.
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.320]   Yeah.
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.880]   So progress, I feel good.
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.120]   Progress is being made.
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.580]   We should mention YouTube.
[00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:41.140]   So for those who haven't heard us say it recently, youtube.com/CalNewportMedia, full episodes
[00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.840]   are all going up there and then Jesse is slicing and dicing all the questions and the segments
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.620]   into their own standalone videos.
[00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.660]   So if there's something you want to go back to and save or share or see me say it instead
[00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.780]   of listening to it, that YouTube page should have what you need.
[00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.840]   We have brand new graphics coming, which is kind of exciting.
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:06.240]   Now that we switched the cover art of the podcast, there's going to be new graphics
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.920]   on the clips, the video clips at the beginning and end.
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.200]   So progress is being made.
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:19.560]   So anyways, check that out, youtube.com/CalNewportMedia to watch individual questions or full episodes.
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:25.240]   So I wanted to do a quick deep dive today before we got into our questions.
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.540]   We do have a good collection of questions, but I wanted to tackle this question, is friction
[00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.080]   bad?
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:40.840]   And the precipitating event that got me thinking about this question was reading John McPhee's
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.240]   book Draft Number Four.
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:51.240]   So Draft Number Four is a book that John McPhee wrote relatively recently about the process
[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.360]   of writing and things he has learned about the process of writing.
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.360]   There's a little bit of memoir thrown in there and quite a bit of discussion on things like
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.880]   structure and what caught my attention among other things when I was reading it is that
[00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:08.320]   he described his research process, how he organized and made use of the information
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.900]   he collected during research in the pre-computer era.
[00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.320]   So McPhee has been active in professional writing since the 60s, so he had a long period
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.780]   before there were computers.
[00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.520]   And here was his process.
[00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:25.480]   He would go out in the field and take tons of notes, both in notebooks and on tape recorders.
[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:28.840]   And McPhee is a long-term researcher.
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:34.000]   It's not unusual for him to spend eight months, 12 months on a single article.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.640]   Now, of course, back then they would write articles of crazy lengths, like 40,000-word
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:39.880]   articles, which is crazy.
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.800]   They'd have to break them up over multiple issues.
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.140]   There are many books.
[00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:45.800]   But he would fill up many notebooks, many tape recorders.
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:46.800]   All right.
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.680]   So how do we get from that?
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:55.280]   How does McPhee get from that stack of notebooks, stack of tapes to an article that's coming
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.280]   out in The New Yorker?
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:57.760]   So here's what he used to do.
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:03.360]   First, he would painstakingly type up all of those notes.
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:08.400]   So he would go through the notebooks and type up on his typewriter—remember, pre-computer
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:13.640]   era—type up on his typewriter everything that was in those notebooks.
[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:19.840]   Then he would go to those tapes, and he would transcribe everything that was recorded on
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.880]   those tapes, all of the interviews and conversations on those tapes.
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:26.840]   He had one of those old-school dictation desks where he had foot pedals, so he could control
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:30.520]   the speed of the tape recorder with a foot pedal so that you could slow it down just
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.440]   enough that you could keep up when you're typing.
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.920]   This used to be real common back when dictation was used.
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.120]   So he would type everything up.
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:41.520]   And when he was typing it up on his typewriter, separate blocks of notes would be separated
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.000]   with multiple blank lines.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.560]   So okay, here's some notes from one conversation.
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.280]   Now here's some notes about something else.
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:49.280]   He'd put blank lines.
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:53.800]   And the reason why he would do that is that after he had laboriously typed up all of this—and
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:59.120]   we're talking weeks and weeks of work—he would Xerox copy every one of those pages,
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:03.200]   take the Xerox copies, and cut out each of those blocks.
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:09.200]   So he had space in between each block of notes, and he would cut out strips from these pages
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:12.060]   along those spaces between the blocks of notes.
[00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:17.040]   So he would just have endless slips of paper, each piece of paper with a separate piece
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.960]   of conversation or observation or note that he had took.
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:24.400]   And he would sort those strips of papers into topic and put them all into a folder dedicated
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:25.400]   to that topic.
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:31.040]   So now he would have, after weeks of work, dozens of folders, each dedicated to a particular
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:35.980]   event, discussion, or topic relevant to the article.
[00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:41.880]   And the folder would be full of all of his notes he had taken anywhere relevant to that
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:42.880]   topic.
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:47.520]   Finally, he would then take a card—I'm assuming it would be an index card, he didn't specify—and
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.600]   for each of these topics, he would write that name on a card.
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:55.280]   And he had a piece of plywood in his office—and Jesse and I were talking about this earlier,
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:09:01.000]   but I was gratified to hear that early in his career, McPhee had a deep work HQ-style
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   office.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.920]   It was in Nassau Street, above a store, across the hall from a massage parlor, just like
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:12.280]   we're above a restaurant on the main street of our town, across from a physical therapist,
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:16.040]   and I don't even know what the other people do.
[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:19.080]   I think they mainly just glared at us for not wearing masks, but I don't even know
[00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:21.600]   what they do.
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:25.840]   And our weird HQ, so McPhee had a weird HQ as well.
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:29.560]   And he would lay these cards out on the plywood and move them around, move them around, what's
[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:30.560]   the structure for this piece?
[00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:35.440]   And he could spend weeks doing that until he finally had figured out this topic, and
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:39.340]   this topic, and back to this, and he had all the cards figured out.
[00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:40.800]   Now he was ready to write.
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.880]   And when it came time to write, he would say, "This is the card I'm on right now.
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:47.480]   Let me take the folder corresponding to that card, open it up, spread out all these slips
[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:48.480]   of paper.
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.600]   Here's everything I know about that topic so I can draw from these quotes and these
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:55.480]   citations and these observations as I'm writing that section of the article."
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:59.480]   Then he moved on to the next section, take that folder, lay them out, write that section
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:00.480]   of the article.
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:04.020]   That is how John McPhee would research and write his articles.
[00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:06.840]   This is an incredibly laborious process.
[00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:09.760]   It's a very time-consuming process.
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:14.820]   He would spend weeks and weeks just working with his notes before he was writing.
[00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:17.840]   It is a process that is full of friction.
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:21.160]   He's literally cutting paper with scissors and putting them in folders.
[00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:24.880]   I mean, this is a process where there's friction all over the place.
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:31.160]   But anyone reading that part of draft number four would say, "That makes complete sense."
[00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:37.180]   What John McPhee was trying to do necessitates slowness.
[00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:44.600]   He has to internalize this information, be exposed to it again and again, marinate in
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:49.240]   this information until he really just feels like he is in that world and understands it.
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:53.480]   So as he begins trying to structure his piece, he can see how it should all come together.
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:56.600]   When it comes time to write a section, he can see what's out there and knows what to
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:57.600]   pull from.
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:02.400]   The friction is a feature, not a bug in this particular system.
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:08.840]   This is common if you study the writing techniques and the research techniques of really acclaimed
[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:10.220]   nonfiction writers.
[00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:14.560]   They have high friction, slow systems.
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:20.180]   There's an early essay I wrote for my newsletter and blog at calnewport.com years ago where
[00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:25.120]   I talked about the historian Taylor Branch's research methods.
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:31.960]   So Taylor Branch wrote this fantastic award-winning trilogy, three-part biography of Martin Luther
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:36.360]   King, epic project, many, many years.
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:40.320]   I believe it won a Pulitzer or a National Book Award, one of the two.
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.640]   Fantastic series.
[00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:44.920]   And he talked about years ago, and I wrote about this, a similarly slow process.
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:50.520]   Now, he had computers at the time he was writing this, but he used a Microsoft Access database
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:57.720]   and every bit of note he would find anywhere, and he would just read everything.
[00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:58.720]   What are all the newspapers?
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:00.920]   Here's a day when Martin Luther King is in this town.
[00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:05.920]   Let me go find all the newspapers from that town on microfiche and go read them and pull
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:08.680]   out anything that seems relevant to understanding what was going on that day.
[00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:13.160]   So I mean, he would really read every letter, but would go three, four layers away from
[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:17.240]   even what King was doing just to find all this tangential information.
[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:22.560]   And he coded everything with a date and put it into this database.
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:26.960]   And then he could spit out, like, okay, here's the period of King's life that I'm writing
[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:34.080]   about now, and he could spit out, give me everything I have notes on from this week.
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:37.040]   Every letter that was written that week, every newspaper I looked at.
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:43.200]   And so again, this laborious process of let me just take everything in and put into a
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:47.440]   database and time code it so when it comes time to write, I can have a density of information.
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:53.720]   What happened on this day and this week and immerse myself in it and then write with confidence
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:58.600]   and with that iceberg below the surface of knowledge, supporting the thing that he was
[00:12:58.600 --> 00:12:59.600]   actually writing about.
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:04.440]   A slow process, laborious process, but a necessary process.
[00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:09.320]   So we see this with acclaimed writers, high friction, slow systems for making sense of
[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:12.760]   information where we don't see this as anywhere else.
[00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:17.840]   And that is what I was noting is that that is a problem.
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:23.980]   We have made productivity synonymous with low friction and speed.
[00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:25.580]   How do we get this done faster?
[00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:27.600]   How do we get you the information you need quicker?
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:30.760]   Can we make connections for you on your behalf?
[00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:32.840]   Maybe the software can show you what you need.
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:34.400]   Can we throw machine learning at it?
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:35.880]   This would be the new thing to do.
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:41.040]   So that the amount of extra effort you have to do really does get minimized.
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:46.000]   And when it comes to hard cognitive work, especially creative cognitive work, minimizing
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.640]   friction, minimizing effort is not necessarily what we want to do.
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:56.600]   The example of John McPheen, the example of Taylor Branch is canonical slow productivity
[00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:58.640]   in action.
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:07.320]   What they were doing required in the moment, inefficient, slow, thoughtful work.
[00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:09.840]   You look at any one day and you might say this day was not productive.
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:14.080]   You cut things with scissors all day, but you fast forward out, zoom out to the looking
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:17.880]   at the next year, that full year, you say, wow, this was a fantastic article you produced
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:18.880]   that year.
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:19.880]   It's a very productive year.
[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:22.880]   You zoom into a particular day, you say you're just cutting things with scissors.
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:25.040]   Zoom out, incredibly productive year.
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:28.060]   And this was my observation.
[00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:29.960]   Friction is sometimes something we want to get rid of.
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:34.520]   If I'm doing a mindless administrative task, make it easier for me to do it.
[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:35.520]   Sure.
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:37.120]   But sometimes friction is exactly what we need.
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:42.360]   If you're doing something deep, taking your time, going slow, having old tools, having
[00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:46.800]   to do processes to take time can be a feature and not a bug.
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:50.640]   So I think it's something we just need to keep in mind.
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:56.000]   Sometimes going slower, sometimes having things be a little bit harder is what you need.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.320]   That's what it sometimes takes to do hard work.
[00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:03.080]   So I admire that process.
[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:09.000]   By the way, like McPhee goes on and talked about his computer setup once he got a computer
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:16.160]   setup and he ran this completely weird old school editing software called K-edit.
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:17.380]   It's like a line editor.
[00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:19.680]   It's not a WSYW word processor.
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:24.920]   It's someone custom programmed for him and he tried to explain it and I couldn't understand
[00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:25.920]   it.
[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:28.400]   So like when he got computers, it did not simplify his life.
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:33.800]   He did not have a sort of Rome account Zettelkasten system that was automatically putting all
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.040]   of his notes around.
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:39.720]   Somehow his computerized system seemed even more complicated to me than what he was doing
[00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:40.720]   with the note cards.
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:43.400]   >> Your buddy Ryan has a similar process too, right?
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:45.200]   With the note cards and folders and stuff.
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:49.520]   >> Yeah, Ryan will write down, Holiday will write down everything of interest from the
[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:54.400]   books he's reading and then put them away into boxes of note cards.
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:55.400]   And he takes his time.
[00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:58.440]   And then when it comes time to write a book, he'll go through and pull out the note cards
[00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:00.840]   he thinks are relevant to that book and the information is all there.
[00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:04.880]   Yeah, it takes a lot longer to do the reading, but he would say that's the point.
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:05.880]   It's like, yeah, I want to take long.
[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:07.360]   I want to pull out the ideas.
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:08.360]   I want to think about them.
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:10.600]   I want to store them so I can use them later.
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:17.040]   You know, slowness is underrated, especially in our current world of work.
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:21.400]   I will, however, Jesse, tell you about something that is not underrated.
[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:24.720]   And that is a product that I have been enjoying.
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:27.240]   I've been running an interesting experiment recently.
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:30.880]   It's called Magic Mind.
[00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:35.120]   And it is a new sponsor of the show, and I'm happy that they are.
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.920]   Here is how it works.
[00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:39.840]   You get these shots.
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:42.620]   So they're in little bottles, right?
[00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:43.620]   So like shot size bottles.
[00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:45.240]   You can take it real quick.
[00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:51.440]   And you take it in the morning, either in place of your morning coffee or you do it
[00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:55.960]   alongside your morning coffee, but it prevents you from having to drink a lot more coffee.
[00:16:55.960 --> 00:17:01.400]   And it is a productivity elixir, essentially.
[00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:02.600]   That is their pitch.
[00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:10.440]   You get a non-jittery, sustainable energy after you take it.
[00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:13.320]   And it prevents you from having a caffeine high and crash.
[00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:18.120]   It prevents you from having, like I typically do, drinking five or six cup of coffees in
[00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:19.520]   a row.
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:21.600]   And I tried it out.
[00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:25.160]   And I can definitely tell the difference.
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:28.800]   You know, I think I can tell the difference because I don't have to immediately get that
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:29.800]   second or third coffee.
[00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:31.720]   You get that more sustained.
[00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:33.880]   I think I'm locked in.
[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:36.480]   Now I don't know how it works.
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:37.480]   It's complicated.
[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:39.800]   They were trying to explain to me, I talked to the founder of the company, he was trying
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:43.120]   to explain to me the 12 functional ingredients.
[00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:46.800]   And I'm not a sophisticated enough biochemist.
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:50.120]   There's something called matcha in it, which I think works really well.
[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:53.640]   It has our adaptogens in it that help fight stress.
[00:17:53.640 --> 00:18:00.720]   It sort of is in a smoothie, you know, fruit smoothie colored type form.
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:04.600]   But I have become a Magic Mind convert.
[00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:07.180]   You know, they gave us a code.
[00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:15.380]   So if you go to magicmind.co/deep, that's our special page, and then use the code DEEP20,
[00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:19.360]   they are going to give everyone 20% off.
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:25.280]   I mean, Jesse, I'm almost embarrassed to admit how much coffee I will drink if I'm unchecked.
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:27.800]   I mean, it can't be healthy.
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:32.160]   It's pots with an S. And I'm not exaggerating that.
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:38.760]   And when I take the shot of Magic Mind, along with that first cup of coffee, I can de-pluralize
[00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:41.120]   pots in terms of how much coffee I drink.
[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:43.240]   I think that's probably better for me.
[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:46.760]   And I'm not literally shaking the equipment off the walls.
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:50.480]   So I'm glad to have Magic Mind as our sponsor.
[00:18:50.480 --> 00:19:02.000]   So don't forget, go to magicmind.co/deep and use that discount code DEEP20 to get 25% off.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.240]   Magic Mind is the best choice when it comes to getting more done in less time through
[00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:08.400]   the power of neurotropics.
[00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:11.960]   So that's an exciting one.
[00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:19.840]   I also want to talk about MunkPak, and in particular, the MunkPak Keto Nut and Seed
[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:21.840]   Bars.
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:28.360]   This is a go-to snack for me when I need that energy boost, but don't have the time or interest
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:30.520]   in eating a full meal.
[00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:31.520]   Here's why I like them.
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:32.520]   They taste great.
[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:38.480]   It has that mix of crunchy and sweet and soft that makes you feel like you must be eating
[00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:41.240]   something that's terrible for you, but it's not at all.
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:47.400]   The MunkPak Keto Nut and Seed Bars have one gram of sugar or less, two to three grams
[00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:52.440]   of net carbs and are only 150 calories.
[00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:58.000]   So you get that satisfying snack without all the sugar, without all those carbs that creates
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.840]   that hard crash.
[00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:02.520]   There's a bunch of different flavors.
[00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:06.080]   I lean towards peanut butter, dark chocolate.
[00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:10.080]   I'm a fan of almost anything that has peanut butter in it, but they also have caramel sea
[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:12.040]   salt, dark chocolate.
[00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:13.840]   These are really good flavors.
[00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:18.880]   In addition to being keto-friendly, because we talked about low sugar, low carbs, they're
[00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:22.120]   also gluten-free, plant-based, and non-GMO.
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:27.900]   They have no soy, no trans fat, no sugar alcohols, or artificial colors.
[00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:32.720]   It's a great way to get that energy without a sugar high crash.
[00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:34.760]   Try it for yourself and you'll see.
[00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:38.120]   The good news is we have a special deal for our listeners.

[00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:15.880]   All right, Jesse, that's making me hungry.
[00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:16.880]   I'm thirsty.
[00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:21.240]   I feel like I need some Magic Mind of MunkPak to get going.
[00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:24.360]   But let's dive into some questions.
[00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:35.360]   Our first question of the episode comes from Worried Housewife who writes, "How can a housewife
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:41.240]   implement deep work into her life or is it only for advancing in career work or for creator/writers,
[00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:42.240]   etc.?
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:43.240]   I love your book.
[00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:46.500]   However, I am mostly a housewife and I feel a bit anxious because the self-help books
[00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:51.540]   seem to imply unless I am writing books or working towards business, my life is mediocre.
[00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:53.700]   I want to be among those who feel accomplished and productive.
[00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:59.780]   What would your advice be for someone implementing the deep life in this situation?"
[00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:02.900]   So I don't know, Jesse, is housewife a word we're not supposed to use anymore?
[00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:05.060]   It doesn't feel like that's the word we're supposed to use anymore.
[00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:08.260]   I mean, she listed it, so I guess you...
[00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:09.620]   Yeah, it's her self-description.
[00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:10.620]   I'm reading verbatim.
[00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:16.540]   I'm thinking stay-at-home parent is probably the word of choice.
[00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:20.740]   So well, for those who are concerned, I'm reading verbatim.
[00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:22.860]   I'm reading verbatim the question.
[00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:25.420]   All right, so this is a good question.
[00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:29.380]   First of all, I think there's a semantic issue that we often have on the show, let's get
[00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:34.540]   back to, which is what exactly do we mean by deep work?
[00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:36.820]   Because again, I talk about this all the time.
[00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:44.260]   I think deep work gets generalized into areas in which it was not meant to originally apply.
[00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:48.300]   So really, the intention behind the phrase deep work is very focused.
[00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:54.980]   It is when you're doing a specific type of cognitive heavy work, it is a mode of doing
[00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:58.380]   that work in which you minimize back and forth context switching.
[00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:02.860]   So you give the thing you're working on full attention with minimal back and forth context
[00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:03.860]   switching.
[00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:09.020]   The main argument being that if you have a hard cognitive task to do, giving that sustained
[00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:12.700]   attention without context shifting is going to be more effective than trying to work on
[00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:15.380]   that task while also switching your attention back and forth.
[00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:18.580]   So that is functionally what deep work is.
[00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:26.180]   And then the larger hypothesis in the book Deep Work is that this is broadly valuable
[00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:30.020]   in a lot of knowledge work fields, and it's becoming more valuable in a lot of knowledge
[00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:34.460]   work fields, especially in the American context.
[00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:36.020]   And we're not paying attention to it.
[00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:40.540]   So that we're setting up work systems that have an accidental side effect of requiring
[00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:45.260]   lots of context switching, requiring lots of time fragmenting, make it very difficult
[00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:47.940]   to actually work on cognitive tasks in this manner.
[00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:49.980]   So we execute those tasks worse.
[00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:56.220]   And so the argument is we should actually prioritize in that work context, giving people
[00:23:56.220 --> 00:24:00.900]   unbroken time to work without distraction.
[00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:01.900]   That's very narrow.
[00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:07.740]   So that would have very little relevance if you're asking about, I'm at home, I'm at home
[00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:08.740]   with the kids.
[00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:12.740]   So you're not working in a knowledge work job that's asking of you to do these sort
[00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:17.020]   of very specific cognitively demanding work tasks.
[00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:19.240]   So these worries aren't relevant to that situation.
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:23.860]   But I think this is just a semantic issue because later in the question you say, what's
[00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:27.620]   your advice for someone implementing the deep life in the situation?
[00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:30.820]   And there I think we're getting to the fruitful question.
[00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:36.700]   I think this is what you're actually asking about is the deep life and perhaps the role
[00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:38.980]   of work or focused work in the deep life.
[00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:41.060]   And I think this is a critical question.
[00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:46.220]   Because we often extrapolate deep work to mean the deep life, but they're two different
[00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:47.220]   things.
[00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:51.460]   Deep work can have a place in a deep life, but they're two different things.
[00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:58.100]   So I'm glad we have a chance to actually talk about this and to try to make a distinction.
[00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:01.740]   So in the theory of the deep life, which is something that was not developed in the book
[00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:05.540]   Deep Work, I introduced the term in the book Deep Work, but don't really get into it.
[00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:07.660]   I wasn't ready to get into that yet.
[00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:12.180]   But in the theory of the deep life that we've evolved on my newsletter and here on this
[00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:17.420]   podcast, the idea is you identify the areas of your life that are important.
[00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:23.520]   And in each of these areas, you focus intensely on the things that are high value and try
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:29.140]   to minimize time wasted on the things that are not important or of lower value in that
[00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:30.140]   area.
[00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:33.780]   So it's really triaging your time and attention towards the things that really matter.
[00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:36.920]   There's a core component to the deep life that says for the things that really matter
[00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:41.660]   in this type of calculus, you might even want to make radical moves to support them.
[00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:47.580]   So make radical changes to how you live your life to really invest in the small number
[00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:49.020]   of things that are most important to you.
[00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:53.140]   That is the underlying concept of the deep life.
[00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:59.460]   Craft is just one piece of the different areas of your life that might be important.
[00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:03.320]   And it's important depends on what you're doing, what your actual situation is.
[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:08.180]   So I think regardless of whether you're working in an office or you're at home taking care
[00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:15.260]   of kids or you're in between jobs and single, whatever the situation is, the calculus of
[00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:16.980]   the deep life is relevant.
[00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:18.340]   What matters to me in my life?
[00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:21.960]   Am I investing in those on things that really matter and not wasting too much time on things
[00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:23.620]   that don't?
[00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:24.620]   That's always relevant.
[00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:25.620]   And I think that is critical.
[00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:30.080]   If you don't have that framework, you're going to be completely adrift.
[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:33.020]   And so there's nothing about being at home with kids that says that framework's not going
[00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:34.020]   to work.
[00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:35.020]   If anything, it's going to be even more important.
[00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:38.860]   It's that framework that's going to make sure that you don't get so caught up in X that
[00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:42.780]   you forget to actually think about this other piece of your life, the community involvement,
[00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:45.260]   constitution, your health and fitness.
[00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:48.380]   You're seeing the different parts of your life and making them important.
[00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:52.420]   The family commitment, the family there is going to be really critical when you do that
[00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:53.420]   deep life calculus.
[00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:58.220]   I mean, this is a, we talk about radical moves to align your life with your current values.
[00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:03.900]   If you're, you're dedicating your time to trying to help your kids raise in a stable,
[00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:08.740]   loving environment and cultivate the type of attributes and values you would want in
[00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:13.440]   leaders and adults who in the future we're going to look to with respect, that's an incredibly
[00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:16.340]   important endeavor.
[00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:20.020]   And so when you're thinking about things that deep life work is just a piece of it.
[00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:23.460]   And the importance of that depends on what you're doing in your life right then.
[00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:24.700]   So I wouldn't worry about that at all.
[00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:27.860]   I would focus on the deep life and making sure that each of the areas of your deep life
[00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:29.740]   are getting attention.
[00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:34.020]   That let's say the kids needs aren't swapping other needs that are also important to you
[00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:37.100]   or to the other people in your life.
[00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:39.740]   Deep work by itself is not that interesting.
[00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:43.820]   It's interesting if you're a knowledge worker who works with your brain to try to add value
[00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:46.980]   to information, then yeah, you want to be doing deep work because if you do it with
[00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:49.160]   a lot of context shifting, you're not going to be doing it as well.
[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:52.300]   But that's just a particular job.
[00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:54.700]   That's just a particular endeavor.
[00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:59.940]   I don't want to put a moral valuation on deep work that basically focus cognitive work is
[00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:02.500]   somehow high value and anything else isn't high value.
[00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:05.300]   No, it's high value in the context of knowledge work.
[00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:07.020]   Deep is better than distracted.
[00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:12.220]   But you leave the context of knowledge work, it's not relevant.
[00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:14.980]   So anyways, I hope that's helpful.
[00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:19.980]   Let's use the deep life as the framing, the thing that has some sort of moral valence
[00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:20.980]   to it.
[00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:25.900]   That this, that's a structure to your life that's trying to intentionally focus on what
[00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:28.780]   matters versus those things that don't.
[00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:30.740]   That is universally important.
[00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:36.540]   And let's narrow in deep work to say this is an approach to doing a certain type of
[00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:40.660]   activity that a lot of people do and it's relevant and we need to care about it, but
[00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:50.100]   it is not by itself the necessary foundation of a good life.
[00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:51.100]   We get that a lot, Jesse, don't we?
[00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:55.420]   Like I think the deep work becomes a stand in for like much bigger.
[00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:59.660]   Yeah, we've been getting a lot of those questions lately, especially from folks who are maybe
[00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:01.460]   retired or at home.
[00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:04.540]   This question, yeah, it's been coming up a lot.
[00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:05.540]   Yep.
[00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:06.540]   Yep.
[00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:07.540]   So good.
[00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:08.540]   I'm glad we had a chance to jump into that.
[00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:09.540]   All right.
[00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:13.060]   So now we have a question from Darcy.
[00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:21.020]   Darcy asks, how do you get to do things you need to do with an ever increasing administration
[00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:24.160]   or administrative overload?
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:25.860]   Administrative creep is a massive problem.
[00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:29.620]   Every service you hire, activity you perform, product you buy comes with an ever increasing
[00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:31.360]   administrative burden.
[00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:33.820]   For example, you buy a washing machine, it doesn't work properly.
[00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:34.820]   You request a refund.
[00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:36.980]   The supplier needs X form completed.
[00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:38.720]   They then deny the refund.
[00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:42.780]   You then turn to a government agency to assist in enforcing your consumer rights.
[00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:44.460]   They require a form to be completed.
[00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:45.900]   Each interaction is by email.
[00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:47.780]   Finally you arrive at a tribunal.
[00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:49.080]   They give you a refund.
[00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:51.900]   Each process requires time and skill.
[00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:55.580]   This is all time away from doing deep work.
[00:29:55.580 --> 00:30:01.880]   And again, Darcy, I would modify that to say this is all time that would keep you away
[00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:08.780]   from the intentional points that you are identifying in your deep life plan, the things you want
[00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:11.500]   to be spending time on, whether they're work or non-work related.
[00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:12.500]   All right.
[00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:19.940]   So that is a good question because administrative creep, that is the growing burden of small
[00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:23.820]   tasks is a big problem.
[00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:25.280]   I think we underestimate it.
[00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:29.100]   We in particular underestimate it in the world of work, the actual burden of administrative
[00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:35.760]   creep on our ability to get things done that actually have value for the organization.
[00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:38.580]   So I have three ideas, Darcy, that I want to share here.
[00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:40.060]   All right.
[00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:43.820]   First, I think you need to be more comfortable wasting more money.
[00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:45.740]   All right.
[00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:49.660]   Yes, your washing machine didn't work right, but man, this is crazy.
[00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:55.140]   You ended up in a tribunal with the government to try to get the refund back.
[00:30:55.140 --> 00:31:00.340]   I mean, part of fighting administrative creep is to the extent possible, doing less things
[00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:01.860]   that generate administrative creep.
[00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:06.700]   And if you can just spend some money or waste some money and not have to deal with something,
[00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:10.540]   to the extent you're able to do that, it's a good investment in time.
[00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:15.980]   I don't know if that refund was really worth all the time you actually just spent there.
[00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:21.320]   So that's the first thing I would suggest is try to reduce what you can in your life,
[00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:22.320]   even if it's not optimal.
[00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:27.100]   Like, oh man, I really should return this thing I got from Amazon.
[00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:31.300]   It's the wrong size, but I just, I'm going to have to go to the UPS store and print this
[00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:32.300]   label.
[00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:33.300]   I don't know what to do.
[00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:35.100]   It's like, or you just eat the $20.
[00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:38.740]   So we got to value time and context shifting.
[00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:43.820]   That's a real cost that we weigh against things like money.
[00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:44.820]   Idea two is to automate.
[00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:52.020]   So I'm a big believer in this when it comes to small tasks is there's two conditions that
[00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:56.740]   a small task can be in, cognitively speaking.
[00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:59.420]   The impact of these two conditions is very different on your brain.
[00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:01.860]   The first condition is that it can kind of be hanging.
[00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:04.580]   It's on a to-do list somewhere, but that's it.
[00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:06.060]   It's something that needs to get done.
[00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:08.660]   It's going to have to, time's going to have to be found.
[00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:11.860]   Things are, information's going to have to be gathered and it's sitting there as this
[00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:14.820]   sort of weight of something that's needs to be done.
[00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:16.860]   You're not quite sure when and how it's going to get done.
[00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:20.820]   The second condition a small task can be in is not hanging.
[00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:24.820]   This is when it's getting done in this time, in this place, here's where the information
[00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:26.300]   is.
[00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:31.700]   You don't have to, it's not on your list of things that you have to actually exert any
[00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:34.460]   additional planning energy towards.
[00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:39.700]   Automation, when I say automate, I mean moving as many of your small tasks as possible into
[00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:42.500]   that second condition.
[00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:44.220]   There's a few things you can do here.
[00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:48.220]   One thing is for recurring tasks, you have a way they always get done.
[00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:49.940]   They always get done the same way.
[00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:55.540]   This day, on this week, every month, here's the spreadsheet I go through and I pay these
[00:32:55.540 --> 00:33:00.140]   bills and I do the budget or whatever it is, but it's the same times, the same days.
[00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:01.500]   You don't have to think about it.
[00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:06.580]   It's just you get to that day, you see the calendar notice and you execute.
[00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:11.100]   It's no longer sitting there as something that is going to require planning energy.
[00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:15.460]   The other thing you can do is have set times put aside for doing these type of tasks in
[00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:16.460]   general.
[00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:20.300]   And maybe what you're actually doing is assigning tasks to these buckets.
[00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:25.780]   Tuesday and Wednesdays, I have a 90 minute block in the afternoon in which I'm doing,
[00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:30.260]   I don't know, student related, class related issues as a professor.
[00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:34.580]   So students have questions, they need to know their grades, there's issues with problem
[00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:35.580]   sets or whatever.
[00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:37.100]   Maybe you have 90 minutes twice a week.
[00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:38.700]   That's when you do that work.
[00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:43.540]   So when any of these questions pop up, you can just throw them on a list in a shared
[00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:45.420]   document somewhere.
[00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:48.220]   And you just know that list gets processed when you get to Tuesday.
[00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:49.660]   And again, when you get to Thursday.
[00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:53.260]   Again, what you're doing here is moving those small tasks into the second condition where
[00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:55.660]   they require no further planning energy.
[00:33:55.660 --> 00:34:00.660]   The final thing is you can have some sort of system put in place for some of this type
[00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:05.180]   of work so that when a request comes in, it's not just hanging there loose.
[00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:06.180]   Here's how we handle it.
[00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:09.220]   Okay, so if this issue comes up, you have to do this, you have to put it on my shared
[00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:10.420]   calendar.
[00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:14.220]   There's a each week I put the notes, whatever it is, but you have some system in place.
[00:34:14.220 --> 00:34:18.300]   What I'm trying to do here with automation is get things out of that condition in which
[00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:20.380]   planning energy still needs to be applied.
[00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:27.500]   And the reason is, is that if you give me 20 tasks, and in scenario A, each of those
[00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:32.540]   20 tasks is going to require at some point, planning energy applied, it's not clear to
[00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:34.020]   you exactly how they're going to get executed.
[00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:36.980]   And over here, you have the same 20 tasks.
[00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:38.500]   No planning energy is required.
[00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:43.360]   They're all in one of these types of pre existing systems or processes, etc.
[00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:51.200]   That second scenario is going to have a much smaller negative impact on your mind on your
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:58.400]   sense of busyness on the sense of what load is lurking above me, it's going to be work
[00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:00.600]   that's going to get done, but almost for free.
[00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:04.400]   It's like it doesn't add up to that quota of how much work, how much work can you have
[00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:07.440]   on your plate before your brain fritzes out and says I have too much.
[00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:12.880]   It doesn't add up to that quota, because it's not work you have to think about and plan.
[00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:14.720]   It's like, you know, you mow the yard on Saturday morning.
[00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:17.520]   So you don't think about that as oh my god, this is something in my plate, I have to figure
[00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:18.520]   out.
[00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:23.000]   So the more you can move tasks in that condition, the least negative impact they're going to
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.560]   have actually on your brain.
[00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:34.440]   And then the third thing I'm going to recommend is don't ignore the impact of attached overhead.
[00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:40.980]   So any significant project or initiative you agree to do, so the main grist of whatever
[00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:46.560]   you do, you know, in your job or whatever you do, the big things that really matter,
[00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:51.280]   like getting this committee together and making a hiring decision, updating the newsletter
[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:56.360]   software that our church uses, whatever it is, right, any non-trivial commitment or project
[00:35:56.360 --> 00:36:01.160]   is going to bring with it a fixed overhead of administrative work.
[00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:05.920]   And once this is on your plate, there's going to be this fixed overhead of we have to talk
[00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:08.960]   back and forth with the other people involved, there's going to have to be some meetings,
[00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:13.680]   there's going to be a background drip of emails that are going to require answering as you're
[00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:15.440]   trying to figure things out.
[00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:20.300]   And you don't want to ignore that fixed amount of overhead because it does not take much
[00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:24.400]   of that until your schedule is overhead dominated.
[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:29.440]   And again, I think this is another issue that people have is they just look at the project
[00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:34.440]   itself, try to get the software updated for our newsletter, we're trying to do a hiring
[00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:41.560]   decision and I've agreed to whatever, put together a new white paper that we send the
[00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:42.560]   clients.
[00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:45.760]   And you look at just the project in isolation, you're like, well, I kind of imagined this
[00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:49.040]   taking a few days and this taking a few days and this taking a week.
[00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:51.440]   And these are the three things I'm working on for the next two weeks, there should be
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:52.440]   plenty of time.
[00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:54.840]   But what you don't have in mind is that each of these projects is bringing with it this
[00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:56.400]   attached overhead.
[00:36:56.400 --> 00:37:00.040]   So now each of these three projects is bringing with it multiple Zoom meetings a week.
[00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:04.040]   Each of these projects is bringing with it, let's say, 10 to 20 back and forth emails
[00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:05.040]   per week.
[00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:08.560]   So now you have 60 back and forth emails, and that's going to translate to something
[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:12.440]   like five to 600 inbox checks to keep up with these back and forth conversations.
[00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:16.920]   And the overhead with just these three projects in a two week period, this overhead itself
[00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:19.800]   can eat up almost all of your time.
[00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:22.540]   And now you feel administrative creep and now you feel overloaded.
[00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:27.680]   So we have to be really careful about how many projects we have on our plate at once.
[00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:32.240]   I'm a big believer of pull systems, should be working on a very small number of big projects
[00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:35.440]   at a time when one is at a stopping point.
[00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:38.480]   Only then do you pull in something new to work on, because if you bring them all on
[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:42.240]   your plate and say, I'll figure it out, the overhead comes with them.
[00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:45.880]   And whether you're working on this project actively today or not, the overhead doesn't
[00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:46.880]   care.
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:48.160]   It's making demands of you.
[00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:50.500]   So that's the other big source of administrative creep.
[00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:54.560]   So have much fewer things on your plate because it's not the time required to write the paper
[00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:56.880]   or update the software that's going to kill you.
[00:37:56.880 --> 00:38:00.040]   It's the 60 emails and the seven Zoom meetings.
[00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:03.140]   That's what's going to end up killing you from a scheduling perspective.
[00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:06.480]   So be very wary about that administrative attached overhead.
[00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:11.040]   Those three things, be less efficient, waste money, automate small tasks, so get them in
[00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:14.380]   that condition where they require no further planning attention and being very careful
[00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:16.000]   about the overhead that comes with projects.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:21.220]   So keep your active project queue low at any one point, I think goes a long ways towards
[00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:24.760]   keeping administrative creep feeling more reasonable.
[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:27.680]   That's a good question.
[00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:29.640]   That's the bane of my existence, administrative creep.
[00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:33.960]   I do what I can, but we all struggle with it.
[00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:34.960]   All right.
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:38.800]   So we've got a question here, not really a name.
[00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:42.840]   This person's name is supposedly Deep Work versus Study and Recall.
[00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:45.680]   So I don't know, maybe it's a foreign name.
[00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:47.240]   Oh, no, here's a name.
[00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:48.240]   It's down here.
[00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:49.240]   Arnav.
[00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:50.240]   Okay.
[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:51.240]   He signed the message.
[00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:52.240]   That's better.
[00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:53.240]   All right.
[00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:54.480]   Arnav says, "Hi, Cal.
[00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:59.520]   In the book Deep Work, you said that working for hours with high intensity is necessary
[00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:02.800]   for producing, thriving, and learning new things.
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:08.600]   But in your Red Book, which is How to Become a Straight A Student, you said, 'Don't work
[00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:13.360]   for more than about an hour, 50 minutes at a time.'
[00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:14.960]   These ideas have confused me.
[00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:19.040]   I want to know when to use Deep Work in a student life."
[00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:26.920]   Well, Arnav, the key to understanding this discrepancy, the 50-minute to an hour suggestion
[00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:30.720]   from Straight A Student and all the case studies of people doing Deep Work for long periods
[00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:38.840]   of time is that Deep Work for long periods of time have a natural ebb and flow of intensity.
[00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:43.000]   So there's periods in which you're like really locked in, and then you let the intensity
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:47.440]   ebb, and then you lock back in again really hard, and you let the intensity ebb.
[00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:51.440]   I mean, if you sat there and could monitor the mental exertions of a computer programmer,
[00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:52.840]   for example, this is what you would see.
[00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:56.280]   There's going to be periods where they're really trying to hold all the pieces of this
[00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:59.320]   algorithm together so they can, "I want this to work, right?
[00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:01.160]   So I've got to do this just right."
[00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:02.620]   And that's really high intensity.
[00:40:02.620 --> 00:40:06.880]   And then there's the, "I'm running, compiling the code, waiting for the debugging messages,"
[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:09.060]   and the intensity drops.
[00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:12.960]   And Straight A Student, that 50-minute to an hour rule is talking about the specific,
[00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:15.920]   highly intense activity of doing active recall studying.
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:21.400]   It's a really intellectually demanding thing where you're trying to replicate from scratch
[00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:24.400]   whatever the information is that you're trying to learn.
[00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:27.800]   You replicate it from scratch without looking at notes as if you were lecturing a class.
[00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:31.680]   That's at the core of how I recommend in that book cementing knowledge.
[00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:33.880]   That's super high intensity.
[00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:36.880]   That's the computer programmer trying to get the, writing the algorithm, has to get it
[00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:38.200]   just right.
[00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:41.600]   And there I was recommending about 50 minutes to an hour because you have to give your brain
[00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:42.600]   a break.
[00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:45.680]   You would give it 10 minutes, then come back into it again.
[00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:48.280]   So if you're a student that's studying for three hours, what you're probably doing is
[00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:52.760]   50 minutes high, 10 or 15 minutes low, 50 minutes high, 10 or 15 minutes low.
[00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:54.420]   And that's how you put those two things together.
[00:40:54.420 --> 00:41:01.060]   So deep work in general ebbs and flows, active recall is a particular deep work activity
[00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:03.800]   that is incredibly focused.
[00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:07.520]   And so you can only sustain that for so long without having to have a breather.
[00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:11.400]   The key thing to remember though, is what do you do when you're energy, you're in an
[00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:12.400]   ebb?
[00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:14.520]   You've been doing active recall for 50 minutes.
[00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:16.960]   Now you're taking a 10 minute break.
[00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:20.520]   You're coding, you were focused in really hard, but now you're waiting for your code
[00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:22.520]   to compile and you have five minutes.
[00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:27.440]   The thing I always come back to is if you're going to have to take a break from what you're
[00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:32.640]   doing, make sure that whatever you consume, whatever you encounter, make sure that it's
[00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:35.320]   not emotionally salient.
[00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:40.020]   So something that's going to get you emotionally activated and not very specifically related
[00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:42.820]   to the type of work you're doing.
[00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:45.280]   So in other words, no Twitter, no email.
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:50.360]   If you go on Twitter or Instagram or Tik Tok or what have you, while you're waiting for
[00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:53.840]   the code to compile, you might see something that really activates your emotions.
[00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:56.840]   And that's going to induce a much more severe context switch, which means it's going to
[00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:58.680]   take longer to get back to your code.
[00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:03.160]   Similarly, if you go and check your email, you're going to see a lot of open loop obligations
[00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:05.560]   that are related to work, but not exactly what you're working on.
[00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:07.200]   And that's going to hijack your brain.
[00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:10.920]   It's going to take a long time to context switch away from that as well.
[00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:16.760]   So during those ebbs, nothing that's emotionally salient, nothing that is sort of highly relevant,
[00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:20.600]   but not quite the same as the work that you're currently doing.
[00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:22.800]   I recommend looking at baseball news.
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:23.800]   That's been my go-to.
[00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:29.560]   I'm glad baseball is back and it is not emotionally salient and it is not related to work.
[00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:33.680]   And that has been good for me, for sure.
[00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:39.720]   Jesse, I'm in a sort of news break right now because I have like a lot of work going on
[00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:45.680]   and sort of high, like scheduling anxiety, but it raises my anxiety floor.
[00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:50.000]   And so I'm basically saying the only news I'm consuming right now is baseball news.
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.920]   And it's been great.
[00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:57.840]   Actually it's really kind of helped tamp down the sort of anxiety floor a little bit.
[00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:01.120]   When you have that instinct of, I want to just see what's going on, they say, let me
[00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:06.880]   just go look at how this prospect is progressing.
[00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:09.800]   Actually I want you, one of your guests online to be Scott Boris.
[00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:11.560]   I want to hear you talk to him.
[00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:12.880]   We should get Scott.
[00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:15.640]   Scott should represent us.
[00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:20.360]   Scott Boris is going to represent us to our sponsors maybe.
[00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:23.080]   Like, Hey, this would be Scott.
[00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:24.080]   All right.
[00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:26.040]   All right, Monk Pack.
[00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:27.400]   I see your offer.
[00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:29.960]   You're offering 30 CPM.
[00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:31.680]   Here's my return offer.
[00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:33.080]   $20 million.
[00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:36.680]   $20 million if you want to be on the show.
[00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:40.160]   And if you don't want to pay the $20 million to be on the show, we'll walk.
[00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:44.080]   I'm sure there's other bar companies out there that would gladly pay it.
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:45.580]   And so $20 million.
[00:43:45.580 --> 00:43:47.880]   And also our only sponsor would be the Washington Nationals.
[00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:53.440]   So that's basically just only moves clients to the Washington Nationals.
[00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:55.280]   Baseball insider chat.
[00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:57.880]   All right.
[00:43:57.880 --> 00:44:00.280]   So here's a non-baseball related question.
[00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:08.120]   We got Marguerite who says, "What lessons can be learned from how modern Orthodox Jews
[00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:15.760]   who are found in every field navigate their Saturday Shabbat to abstain from any electronic
[00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:16.760]   inputs?"
[00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:21.760]   Well, I'm a big believer in the practice of Shabbat.
[00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:27.200]   I don't care as much about the super specifics of the rules, right?
[00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:30.160]   Like exactly what you can use or don't use.
[00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:34.680]   And does a combustion engine, is that going to count as creating energy?
[00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:36.580]   And can you turn on the light or not turn the light?
[00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:41.280]   So I'm not too caught up in the specific rules that maybe if you were a modern Orthodox Jew,
[00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:46.580]   you might think about how do we interpret this versus a different level of observance.
[00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:53.240]   But the thing I'm a big believer in is the underlying idea here of having this day of
[00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:58.260]   rest for your mind to reset and to connect on other things that are important that aren't
[00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:01.620]   related to work and aren't related to the news.
[00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:04.060]   I think this is a fantastic ritual.
[00:45:04.060 --> 00:45:12.460]   What I think is important, this is what I more or less do, no work, no email, no digital
[00:45:12.460 --> 00:45:13.460]   news.
[00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:18.780]   So just all of those stimulating things, the outside world stimulating and trying to capture
[00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:24.460]   your mind, Friday sundown, Saturday sundown, take them out of your life.
[00:45:24.460 --> 00:45:30.140]   I think everyone could use that and everyone could find some relief and not just being
[00:45:30.140 --> 00:45:34.300]   away from that, but rediscovering the things that that keeps them away from.
[00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:37.220]   Friday night, it can be family, you're connected to your family.
[00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:42.820]   The next day it's activities, you go and do things, you read, but you're not in that peak
[00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:46.980]   state of anxious information consumption.
[00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:48.060]   So we do that.
[00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:52.860]   We do something like that, Friday sundown, Saturday sundown, and maybe we'll even refine
[00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:53.860]   that practice.
[00:45:53.860 --> 00:45:55.340]   But I think there's great wisdom there.
[00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:59.020]   And this should not be a surprise.
[00:45:59.020 --> 00:46:04.820]   It's something I talk about a fair amount, that wisdom traditions have a lot of wisdom
[00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:12.100]   to offer because it is not just an arbitrary book.
[00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:18.380]   Wisdom traditions often, what you have here is ideas and thoughts and rituals and techniques
[00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:25.820]   and practices for living that have been battle tested in harder situations than you live
[00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:27.180]   in now.
[00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:31.620]   And a lot of stuff didn't survive, but the stuff that has survived, the stuff that we
[00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:36.900]   will consider revelation, give it that moniker, is the things that actually seem to work,
[00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:40.500]   the spiritual technologies that actually seem compatible with the way that the human mind
[00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:42.980]   and the human soul actually operates.
[00:46:42.980 --> 00:46:46.620]   There's a reason why the books stick around.
[00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:54.300]   It's why the Tanakh is still here 2,800 years later, is because there's something deeply
[00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:56.620]   true about a lot of these ideas.
[00:46:56.620 --> 00:47:01.380]   So we shouldn't be surprised that in one of our oldest wisdom traditions still surviving,
[00:47:01.380 --> 00:47:04.140]   we find this idea, this idea that is laid down in Genesis.
[00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:07.460]   I mean, we're talking very old.
[00:47:07.460 --> 00:47:09.860]   God took the seventh day and he rested.
[00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:15.300]   There is wisdom in it that makes complete sense when now today in 2022, you put down
[00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:20.580]   the phone on Friday night and there is no Twitter and there is no Instagram and you're
[00:47:20.580 --> 00:47:23.420]   not scrolling for things and you're not checking through emails.
[00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:25.620]   There's a perspective, there's a peace, there's a calmness.
[00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:29.260]   I'm a big Shabbat fan, so I recommend it.
[00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:30.260]   All right.
[00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:33.820]   I think we have time for a couple more questions.
[00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:38.300]   Let me just talk briefly about a couple of the other sponsors that help make this show
[00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:44.940]   possible and thanks to Scott Boras for negotiating great terms for these sponsors.
[00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:47.140]   It's $20 million well spent.
[00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:48.140]   But let's talk stamps.com.
[00:47:48.140 --> 00:47:51.460]   All right.
[00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:53.580]   Here's the thing.
[00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:55.380]   Time is money.
[00:47:55.380 --> 00:48:01.660]   You do not want to waste either traveling to the post office, parking, waiting in those
[00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:07.460]   long, long lines at the post office just to discover that you left the other thing at
[00:48:07.460 --> 00:48:11.380]   home and you have to go all the way back and get it.
[00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:17.260]   With stamps.com, you can skip that trip and focus on how to take your small business to
[00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:18.260]   the next level.
[00:48:18.260 --> 00:48:23.020]   Put your energy where it matters, not to wrangling with post office lines.
[00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:27.280]   Stamps.com lets you print official postage right from your computer and saves you money
[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:28.280]   in the process.
[00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:33.240]   You can spend not just less time at the post office, but you can actually save the money
[00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:36.780]   you were spending on shipping before.
[00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:38.660]   I'm a believer in stamps.com.
[00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:41.540]   We're near the post office right here.
[00:48:41.540 --> 00:48:46.980]   I've talked about this before, but during the pandemic, they social distanced the line
[00:48:46.980 --> 00:48:48.620]   and there's no room in the post office.
[00:48:48.620 --> 00:48:51.740]   The line would stretch down the street because everyone was distanced out.
[00:48:51.740 --> 00:48:56.260]   It just was a reminder every day of, man, it takes a long time to go to the post office.
[00:48:56.260 --> 00:49:00.340]   I'm glad stamps.com exists as an alternative.
[00:49:00.340 --> 00:49:03.660]   They've been around for more than 20 years.
[00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:07.900]   They've been used by over 1 million businesses.
[00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:12.940]   They give you access to all the post office and UPS shipping services.
[00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:14.980]   You can do it right from your computer.
[00:49:14.980 --> 00:49:17.740]   They give you huge discount rates on that shipping services.
[00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:21.940]   So even though you pay a small monthly fee for stamps.com, if you ship more than just
[00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:27.140]   a minuscule amount of things, you're actually making money, not spending it.
[00:49:27.140 --> 00:49:30.260]   So stop overpaying for shipping with stamps.com.
[00:49:30.260 --> 00:49:35.180]   If you sign up with promo code "DEEP", you will get a special offer that includes a four-week
[00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:40.100]   trial free postage and a digital scale, no long-term commitments, no contracts needed.
[00:49:40.100 --> 00:49:46.060]   Just go to stamps.com, click the microphone at the top of the page and enter that code
[00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:47.060]   "DEEP".
[00:49:47.060 --> 00:49:51.780]   I also want to talk about Headspace.
[00:49:51.780 --> 00:49:53.300]   I've actually been using Headspace.
[00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:55.580]   I just was telling you about this before.
[00:49:55.580 --> 00:50:01.940]   I was using some of their anti-anxiety breathing related mini meditations.
[00:50:01.940 --> 00:50:06.100]   There was a period where I was just feeling really, there's just so many things going
[00:50:06.100 --> 00:50:10.700]   on that I was feeling kind of peak, peak shaky energy, right?
[00:50:10.700 --> 00:50:13.140]   And I was like, okay, I got to, I got to try to calm this down.
[00:50:13.140 --> 00:50:14.140]   And Headspace was my go-to.
[00:50:14.140 --> 00:50:18.820]   They had some great mini meditations for it that focused on breathing to bring down the
[00:50:18.820 --> 00:50:21.060]   sympathetic nervous system.
[00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:22.940]   And it worked quite well.
[00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:26.820]   I like it because it's guided meditations.
[00:50:26.820 --> 00:50:32.100]   So it's not just, I'm going to have to be 30 minutes sitting in quiet, hearing all my
[00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:33.100]   thoughts.
[00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:34.100]   They help you.
[00:50:34.100 --> 00:50:37.660]   It's a great, they have a couple of great narrators that walk you through it.
[00:50:37.660 --> 00:50:40.660]   And so that made me a Headspace believer.
[00:50:40.660 --> 00:50:42.140]   And I don't think I'm the only one who needs that.
[00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:46.940]   I mean, we all say that we're fine, even when we don't mean it, but fine is not really an
[00:50:46.940 --> 00:50:47.940]   emotion.
[00:50:47.940 --> 00:50:50.340]   And how many times have you just told the world, oh, I'm fine.
[00:50:50.340 --> 00:50:53.480]   And what you really feel is anger or sadness or nerves.
[00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:54.820]   This is where Headspace can come in.
[00:50:54.820 --> 00:50:59.420]   It is scientifically proven to help you manage your feelings and mental health.
[00:50:59.420 --> 00:51:05.140]   In fact, a recent study proved in just two weeks, Headspace can reduce your stress by
[00:51:05.140 --> 00:51:06.140]   14%.
[00:51:06.140 --> 00:51:09.700]   I believe that whether you want to relieve stress and anxiety, sleep better or improve
[00:51:09.700 --> 00:51:10.700]   your focus.
[00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:14.820]   And yes, by the way, that's another type of meditation Headspace now has.
[00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:17.180]   Focus, you do the guided meditation.
[00:51:17.180 --> 00:51:19.440]   So you're ready to lock in on the work you're about to do.
[00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:22.380]   So deep questions, listeners take note.
[00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:25.740]   So regardless of what you're trying to do, anxiety, focus, sleeping better, Headspace
[00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:32.900]   is your everyday dose of mindfulness for real life.
[00:51:32.900 --> 00:51:40.260]   So however you're feeling, I recommend that you try Headspace at headspace.com/questions
[00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:45.540]   and you will get one month free of their entire mindfulness library.
[00:51:45.540 --> 00:51:52.740]   This is the best Headspace offer available, but you have to go to headspace.com/questions
[00:51:52.740 --> 00:51:53.740]   today to get it.
[00:51:53.740 --> 00:51:54.740]   That's headspace.com/questions.
[00:51:54.740 --> 00:52:01.680]   All right, we've got time for a couple more quick questions.
[00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:05.500]   We have one here from Cindy.
[00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:10.580]   Cindy says, "I'm starting my fourth try to do a digital detox.
[00:52:10.580 --> 00:52:14.740]   I just can't seem to make it the 30 days.
[00:52:14.740 --> 00:52:15.740]   What is your advice?"
[00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:21.340]   Well, first of all, Cindy, I think we might diagnose part of the problem in just the words
[00:52:21.340 --> 00:52:23.120]   you were using.
[00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:26.620]   You called what you're trying to do a detox.
[00:52:26.620 --> 00:52:28.540]   I don't use the phrase digital detox.
[00:52:28.540 --> 00:52:32.900]   If you read the book, Digital Minimalism, where I'm assuming you're extracting this
[00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:39.780]   plan to spend 30 days away from optional technologies, I call it a digital declutter.
[00:52:39.780 --> 00:52:44.260]   There's a reason why I make that distinction is because in the context of digital tools,
[00:52:44.260 --> 00:52:48.220]   detox has taken on this very specific and I think very weird meaning.
[00:52:48.220 --> 00:52:53.020]   It means I want to white knuckle separate myself away from these services that I spend
[00:52:53.020 --> 00:52:56.420]   too much time on because I don't like that I spend so much time on them, and I want to
[00:52:56.420 --> 00:53:00.140]   detoxify my addictive urge to use them.
[00:53:00.140 --> 00:53:05.860]   The reason why I say that's a weird application of the term is that, of course, in the substance
[00:53:05.860 --> 00:53:11.220]   abuse community, where the notion of detox or the relevant notion of detox comes from,
[00:53:11.220 --> 00:53:15.380]   the whole idea is not taking a break, but to completely change your life.
[00:53:15.380 --> 00:53:19.540]   It is the first step as part of transforming your life so that you don't use that substance
[00:53:19.540 --> 00:53:20.540]   anymore.
[00:53:20.540 --> 00:53:22.860]   In the digital world, we just say, "It's a break.
[00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:25.820]   I don't like this thing, so let me just be away from it, and that will somehow make my
[00:53:25.820 --> 00:53:26.820]   life better."
[00:53:26.820 --> 00:53:32.020]   Declutter, on the other hand, says, "No, we're not just staying away from that closet that
[00:53:32.020 --> 00:53:33.860]   has too much stuff in it.
[00:53:33.860 --> 00:53:36.500]   We're going to take everything out and just put back the stuff that matters.
[00:53:36.500 --> 00:53:39.860]   We're going to make the closet permanently better, and that is what I think you need
[00:53:39.860 --> 00:53:41.700]   to do for your digital life."
[00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:45.660]   The key thing that separates a declutter from a detox is that you don't just white-knuckle
[00:53:45.660 --> 00:53:47.340]   it.
[00:53:47.340 --> 00:53:50.540]   You don't just sit there and say, "Don't use Instagram.
[00:53:50.540 --> 00:53:51.540]   Don't use Instagram.
[00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:53.460]   Don't use Instagram," and hope you make it 30 days.
[00:53:53.460 --> 00:53:58.020]   You instead have to be incredibly active, aggressively reflecting and experimenting
[00:53:58.020 --> 00:54:00.900]   to rediscover the things that you really care about in your life.
[00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:02.540]   These 30 days should be busy.
[00:54:02.540 --> 00:54:05.500]   You should have lots of plans, lots of things you're doing.
[00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:06.620]   You're going over here.
[00:54:06.620 --> 00:54:07.620]   You're going with friends here.
[00:54:07.620 --> 00:54:08.620]   You're going to this museum.
[00:54:08.620 --> 00:54:09.620]   You're reading these books.
[00:54:09.620 --> 00:54:10.620]   You're going to this club.
[00:54:10.620 --> 00:54:13.620]   You're doing a new online class," because what you're trying to do is get back in touch
[00:54:13.620 --> 00:54:16.660]   in the absence of all these distractions with what you really care about.
[00:54:16.660 --> 00:54:21.820]   And then when you're done with the 30-day declutter, you rebuild your digital life from
[00:54:21.820 --> 00:54:22.820]   scratch.
[00:54:22.820 --> 00:54:24.780]   You don't go back to what you were doing before.
[00:54:24.780 --> 00:54:27.540]   You don't never use technology again.
[00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:32.700]   Instead you say, "Okay, now that I've rebuilt my life around activities that are important
[00:54:32.700 --> 00:54:37.020]   to me, initiatives that are important to me, what tools will help me with this?"
[00:54:37.020 --> 00:54:41.920]   And you very intentionally bring technology back into your life, but you deploy it very
[00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:44.380]   strategically to support the things you care about.
[00:54:44.380 --> 00:54:47.460]   And everything that doesn't support something you care about, you just ignore.
[00:54:47.460 --> 00:54:50.980]   And the stuff you do bring back in, you put nice gates around, nice fences around, you
[00:54:50.980 --> 00:54:55.180]   have rules about when you use it, how you use it, et cetera.
[00:54:55.180 --> 00:54:56.180]   That's the digital declutter.
[00:54:56.180 --> 00:55:02.860]   So the reason why I would diagnose you are probably having trouble with these detoxes
[00:55:02.860 --> 00:55:05.180]   is that you're just trying to white knuckle it.
[00:55:05.180 --> 00:55:07.060]   And that's not very successful.
[00:55:07.060 --> 00:55:11.180]   And I've seen that in the large number of people who have gone through these experiments
[00:55:11.180 --> 00:55:14.700]   on my behalf and told me about how it went, is that the people that just try to stay away
[00:55:14.700 --> 00:55:20.360]   from the technologies they don't like, struggle.
[00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:23.740]   Those that instead say, "While I'm staying away from those technologies, I'm rebuilding
[00:55:23.740 --> 00:55:27.620]   my life and rediscovering what I care about," don't struggle.
[00:55:27.620 --> 00:55:31.380]   Change that is built around an aspirational positive vision of your life is always way
[00:55:31.380 --> 00:55:35.340]   more sustainable than change built around just avoiding things that you're assessing
[00:55:35.340 --> 00:55:36.340]   to be negative.
[00:55:36.340 --> 00:55:38.060]   So Cindy, that's my advice.
[00:55:38.060 --> 00:55:43.420]   Go back and read that chapter in digital minimalism and focus on the active part, the stuff you
[00:55:43.420 --> 00:55:47.860]   have to do instead, the replacements, the discovery, the reflection.
[00:55:47.860 --> 00:55:51.740]   I think that's where you're going to find a key to succeeding with your declutter.
[00:55:51.740 --> 00:55:56.020]   All right, let's do one last question.
[00:55:56.020 --> 00:55:57.740]   This one comes from Glenn.
[00:55:57.740 --> 00:56:04.100]   Glenn asks, "How do you think about thinking?"
[00:56:04.100 --> 00:56:08.460]   Glenn goes on to elaborate, "I was intrigued by a recent podcast where you described how
[00:56:08.460 --> 00:56:14.020]   when COVID started, you sent out daily emails to your family, helping them think about what
[00:56:14.020 --> 00:56:15.900]   you and they were experiencing.
[00:56:15.900 --> 00:56:19.300]   You mentioned a couple of reliable sources for news about COVID, people you had learned
[00:56:19.300 --> 00:56:20.300]   to trust.
[00:56:20.300 --> 00:56:25.940]   Selfishly, I'd be interested in hearing who your trusted sources are.
[00:56:25.940 --> 00:56:30.900]   And for the purposes of your podcast, I would love to hear about how you think about thinking.
[00:56:30.900 --> 00:56:34.140]   What I mean is, how did you decide what was and was not a trusted source?
[00:56:34.140 --> 00:56:37.780]   How do you distinguish between conspiratorial thinking and good thinking?
[00:56:37.780 --> 00:56:41.580]   When do you trust the science and when is it proper to have some skepticism?"
[00:56:41.580 --> 00:56:45.560]   Well, it's a good question, Glenn.
[00:56:45.560 --> 00:56:47.420]   So I did do that newsletter for my family.
[00:56:47.420 --> 00:56:52.220]   It was positive news surrounding the COVID pandemic.
[00:56:52.220 --> 00:56:55.860]   It was trying to counteract all of the negativity out there.
[00:56:55.860 --> 00:56:58.940]   I stopped that after vaccines.
[00:56:58.940 --> 00:57:04.780]   So after my family had been vaccinated, after it was clear from the statistics that our
[00:57:04.780 --> 00:57:09.060]   risk was small, comparable to other things that we face on a daily basis and don't care
[00:57:09.060 --> 00:57:13.620]   about, I wanted to shift my focus away from COVID.
[00:57:13.620 --> 00:57:19.820]   And the reason is, of course, I mean, life is a gift and you don't want to waste it.
[00:57:19.820 --> 00:57:23.300]   You don't want to waste parts of your life that you could avoid not wasting.
[00:57:23.300 --> 00:57:30.220]   And it seemed to me that an excessive concentration on COVID as a unique threat, once we knew
[00:57:30.220 --> 00:57:35.180]   statistically that it wasn't a unique threat for us compared to other things, was in some
[00:57:35.180 --> 00:57:39.740]   sense felt like we were dismissing the beauty that was life.
[00:57:39.740 --> 00:57:46.540]   To remain, I think, stuck and obsessed and anxious about just this one thing longer than
[00:57:46.540 --> 00:57:48.660]   we had to.
[00:57:48.660 --> 00:57:52.060]   It was completely reasonable at some point, but to do that any minute longer than was
[00:57:52.060 --> 00:57:56.020]   necessary seemed like it was wasting this resource that we had been gifted.
[00:57:56.020 --> 00:58:01.780]   We wanted to see people experience art, enjoy experiences, get back to the things that make
[00:58:01.780 --> 00:58:02.780]   human life human.
[00:58:02.780 --> 00:58:09.020]   So once we were no longer in that period of acute threat, I stopped that newsletter.
[00:58:09.020 --> 00:58:13.260]   And I see it, I would say the bubbles in which people are excessively anxious about COVID
[00:58:13.260 --> 00:58:15.780]   have really shrunk.
[00:58:15.780 --> 00:58:18.860]   It was everyone, and then it shrunk.
[00:58:18.860 --> 00:58:19.860]   This is very crude.
[00:58:19.860 --> 00:58:24.380]   At some point, it shrunk to, I guess, just blue states, and now it has shrunk to certain
[00:58:24.380 --> 00:58:25.700]   like metropolitan areas.
[00:58:25.700 --> 00:58:28.740]   And there's only a handful of them left.
[00:58:28.740 --> 00:58:32.740]   Our Deep Work HQ is in one of those areas.
[00:58:32.740 --> 00:58:38.620]   There's a surprising amount of people walking by themselves with high filtration mask on.
[00:58:38.620 --> 00:58:39.620]   And I just have a lot of empathy.
[00:58:39.620 --> 00:58:45.260]   I mean, I understand anxiety and something about viruses can tap something primal and
[00:58:45.260 --> 00:58:47.260]   create a really hard loop to break.
[00:58:47.260 --> 00:58:52.500]   And I am fortunate enough that we were able to break out of that loop and be able to go
[00:58:52.500 --> 00:58:57.420]   and basically live the best life we can in whatever the constraints were at the moment.
[00:58:57.420 --> 00:58:59.740]   But let's get to the bigger question here.
[00:58:59.740 --> 00:59:01.900]   How did I convince myself of that?
[00:59:01.900 --> 00:59:04.380]   How did I navigate the sea of COVID information?
[00:59:04.380 --> 00:59:09.800]   And more generally, how should people find good sources when it comes to any sort of
[00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:12.020]   issue that is important to you?
[00:59:12.020 --> 00:59:17.140]   How do we burst out of the filter bubbles that can put us into some sort of intellectual
[00:59:17.140 --> 00:59:24.900]   isolation and in doing so perhaps lead to a narrowing of options or a dimming of what's
[00:59:24.900 --> 00:59:27.380]   possible in life?
[00:59:27.380 --> 00:59:33.820]   My big recommendation here is to luxuriate in the dialectic.
[00:59:33.820 --> 00:59:40.460]   You have to clash smart, convincing good people on different sides of issues together.
[00:59:40.460 --> 00:59:42.260]   You have to do that.
[00:59:42.260 --> 00:59:49.420]   As soon as you stop doing that, you're in great danger of falling into a filter bubble
[00:59:49.420 --> 00:59:53.580]   where this is super true and this is super wrong.
[00:59:53.580 --> 00:59:57.460]   And I can't even believe those people can wake up in the morning knowing how wrong they
[00:59:57.460 --> 00:59:58.540]   are.
[00:59:58.540 --> 01:00:03.940]   And I just think as soon as you fall into a filter bubble, life narrows, options constrict,
[01:00:03.940 --> 01:00:08.740]   anger and anxiety raises, and you can fall into these negative loops.
[01:00:08.740 --> 01:00:15.340]   Like the people who like right now could be embracing what is good about life and still
[01:00:15.340 --> 01:00:19.380]   is very nervous about having someone into their home.
[01:00:19.380 --> 01:00:20.380]   So filter bubbles can be a problem.
[01:00:20.380 --> 01:00:23.820]   So the dialectic is how you get out of this.
[01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:26.460]   Let me get someone who's convincing on the other side of this thing that kind of feels
[01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:28.300]   like right or what I've been hearing.
[01:00:28.300 --> 01:00:29.460]   Let's put them together.
[01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:30.460]   Let's collide them.
[01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:34.060]   And every time you do that, you get a deeper, more nuanced understanding of what's true.
[01:00:34.060 --> 01:00:35.860]   I did that all throughout COVID.
[01:00:35.860 --> 01:00:36.980]   And you know what?
[01:00:36.980 --> 01:00:39.100]   The experts shifted.
[01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:44.140]   There was a time very early in COVID where there were certain commentators who were coming
[01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:49.580]   more from the conservative end of the spectrum that had critiques of lockdown policies.
[01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:53.700]   And I would steelman them and steelman their lockdown policy justifications.
[01:00:53.700 --> 01:00:55.260]   And I'd hit them together.
[01:00:55.260 --> 01:00:59.460]   And I'd come away and be like, hmm, there's something a little bit weird going on here,
[01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:00.460]   I think.
[01:01:00.460 --> 01:01:01.460]   And it's a complicated issue.
[01:01:01.460 --> 01:01:05.580]   But I was like, let me keep some of these sources in my queue of things I'm listening
[01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:09.980]   to because I think the front page of the New York Times or the Washington Post, there was
[01:01:09.980 --> 01:01:15.500]   things that was-- there was angles that were being purposefully ignored, information that
[01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:16.500]   was being emphasized.
[01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:19.100]   I was like, OK, this is kind of-- there's something interesting going on here.
[01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:23.420]   Those same sources that maybe I was looking at as the convincing counter examples to the
[01:01:23.420 --> 01:01:30.140]   lockdown policies later on became much less convincing when it came to things like vaccines.
[01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:36.020]   There's certain specific sources I can think about who they, for whatever reason, had a
[01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:38.020]   particular thought on vaccines.
[01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:42.300]   And when I would steelman that against the best other thought, they were just blown out
[01:01:42.300 --> 01:01:43.300]   of the water.
[01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:47.340]   It was like, oh, this is incredibly non-convincing and selective.
[01:01:47.340 --> 01:01:48.700]   And I can see you're ignoring this.
[01:01:48.700 --> 01:01:49.740]   And I'm reading the other side.
[01:01:49.740 --> 01:01:50.740]   And so it was the same people.
[01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:52.300]   Then they were no longer that trusted for me.
[01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:55.420]   Then there were sources that I thought were very useful early in vaccination that were
[01:01:55.420 --> 01:01:58.380]   very good about immunity and the immune system.
[01:01:58.380 --> 01:02:01.100]   These were often sources that came out of HIV medicine.
[01:02:01.100 --> 01:02:07.980]   People that came out of HIV were very useful in this sort of immediate post-vaccine moment
[01:02:07.980 --> 01:02:13.340]   because they-- first of all, HIV knows a lot about harm reduction policies, which is quite
[01:02:13.340 --> 01:02:16.500]   different than what we were doing with COVID, which was more about risk elimination policies.
[01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:18.580]   And they knew a lot about the immune system.
[01:02:18.580 --> 01:02:22.100]   So here's what's going to happen with a vaccine or prior infection.
[01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:23.900]   And that felt really useful.
[01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:29.740]   And when I was pushing them against other people who had different views on the vaccine,
[01:02:29.740 --> 01:02:31.660]   it's like, oh, I really understand more about immunity.
[01:02:31.660 --> 01:02:33.100]   That was very useful.
[01:02:33.100 --> 01:02:36.460]   And now there's other doctors who-- I don't follow the news on COVID as much anymore now
[01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:38.780]   because, again, I'm trying to live life.
[01:02:38.780 --> 01:02:40.860]   And I think I can not think as much about it.
[01:02:40.860 --> 01:02:45.900]   But the point is dialectic, collision, collision, collision.
[01:02:45.900 --> 01:02:48.740]   And you get this nuanced view.
[01:02:48.740 --> 01:02:51.940]   And so early on, it's like, I see what's going on with the lockdowns.
[01:02:51.940 --> 01:02:53.740]   But I have these points of skepticism.
[01:02:53.740 --> 01:02:56.540]   It's because I was putting these two things together.
[01:02:56.540 --> 01:02:59.860]   And if you looked at either of those sides in isolation, you'd be in a real extreme.
[01:02:59.860 --> 01:03:03.780]   You'd be-- you're either in the extreme of, like, why can't we do what China's doing?
[01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:05.900]   If we could do that, COVID would go away.
[01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:12.580]   Or you're on this other extreme that was like, this is all a plot to, I don't know, some
[01:03:12.580 --> 01:03:13.740]   great reset plot.
[01:03:13.740 --> 01:03:15.780]   And there's no reason to be doing any of this.
[01:03:15.780 --> 01:03:18.260]   But you nail the most convincing people from both sides together.
[01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:19.980]   You get nuance.
[01:03:19.980 --> 01:03:21.740]   And you feel settled.
[01:03:21.740 --> 01:03:22.900]   You feel confident.
[01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:25.060]   With immunity, with all these different issues.
[01:03:25.060 --> 01:03:26.420]   Always hit them together.
[01:03:26.420 --> 01:03:30.540]   And here's my-- the big point I want to make about this general filter bubble bursting
[01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:34.500]   approach is that you're not going to be tricked.
[01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:38.300]   Exposing yourself to the other side of an idea, the other side of what seems instinctually
[01:03:38.300 --> 01:03:42.780]   right or what your tribe supports, is not going to trick you into the wrong information.
[01:03:42.780 --> 01:03:46.380]   As I talked about just multiple times here in these COVID-specific examples, there is
[01:03:46.380 --> 01:03:52.940]   people that I was once kind of listening to that wilted, wilted under this exercise as
[01:03:52.940 --> 01:03:53.940]   time went on.
[01:03:53.940 --> 01:04:00.500]   I mean, it is a great identifier of true intellectual depth, intellectual honesty, accuracy.
[01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:01.820]   It really works very well.
[01:04:01.820 --> 01:04:04.480]   And it's not-- you're not going to be tricked into some weird conspiracy.
[01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:07.060]   It's actually going to make your beliefs and the things you believe in stronger.
[01:04:07.060 --> 01:04:08.900]   It's going to give you more confidence.
[01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:13.140]   It's probably why today I'm an extreme moderate with COVID, because I've been doing this the
[01:04:13.140 --> 01:04:15.180]   whole time.
[01:04:15.180 --> 01:04:17.060]   And I feel confident in my risk assessments.
[01:04:17.060 --> 01:04:18.060]   I'm not super alarmist.
[01:04:18.060 --> 01:04:19.500]   I'm not super dismissive.
[01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:21.980]   And I think we've done the right things to keep our family risk low.
[01:04:21.980 --> 01:04:24.420]   But also, I'm living life.
[01:04:24.420 --> 01:04:26.500]   And I think it's statistically valid that I am.
[01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:28.980]   And it's because I kept hitting these things against each other.
[01:04:28.980 --> 01:04:30.620]   And I didn't get captured by either side.
[01:04:30.620 --> 01:04:34.460]   I actually ended up in a sort of alt-middle position that would end up, I think, being
[01:04:34.460 --> 01:04:35.460]   pretty useful.
[01:04:35.460 --> 01:04:41.780]   So I think that's what we need to do in this age of information abundance.
[01:04:41.780 --> 01:04:45.980]   If everyone is going through the same homogenized interface platforms like Twitter or Instagram,
[01:04:45.980 --> 01:04:50.940]   and so the crazy guy down the street, his tweet looks the same as the scholar of 50
[01:04:50.940 --> 01:04:51.940]   years.
[01:04:51.940 --> 01:04:55.100]   And we're trying to sift through this and figure out what makes sense and what doesn't.
[01:04:55.100 --> 01:04:56.900]   That's the best thing you can do.
[01:04:56.900 --> 01:04:58.380]   Take the thing that sounds most convincing.
[01:04:58.380 --> 01:04:59.980]   Take the thing that sounds most convincing on the other side.
[01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:01.940]   Hit them together and repeat.
[01:05:01.940 --> 01:05:04.300]   That is how you burst out of filter bubbles.
[01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:05.620]   That's how you find what you really believe in.
[01:05:05.620 --> 01:05:06.620]   It's how you find nuance.
[01:05:06.620 --> 01:05:08.980]   I really think it's the way to go.
[01:05:08.980 --> 01:05:14.380]   And in doing that, the final thing I would say is be very wary of complete tribal allegiance.
[01:05:14.380 --> 01:05:21.300]   If you see in someone you're looking at as a source of information an incredible, consistent,
[01:05:21.300 --> 01:05:26.500]   whatever that tribe says on the opposite, and even if it contradicts itself down the
[01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:34.060]   line, you see that going on, then don't even bother with that person in a dialectical collision.
[01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:37.700]   When I say convincing, you want someone who looks like they at least appear to be intellectually
[01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:38.860]   honest.
[01:05:38.860 --> 01:05:45.340]   If you see complete tribal allegiance, like I will keep, what does my team believe?
[01:05:45.340 --> 01:05:46.340]   That's what's right.
[01:05:46.340 --> 01:05:47.340]   What does that team believe?
[01:05:47.340 --> 01:05:48.420]   We're the opposite.
[01:05:48.420 --> 01:05:50.980]   That should be a, you could filter those people out right away.
[01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:57.180]   But for the people who remain dialectic, dialectic, dialectic, I think we all should be doing
[01:05:57.180 --> 01:05:58.180]   that.
[01:05:58.180 --> 01:06:00.740]   And if you do that, I don't know, you get a much more sophisticated, nuanced view of
[01:06:00.740 --> 01:06:02.380]   life.
[01:06:02.380 --> 01:06:03.420]   You won't end up at extreme.
[01:06:03.420 --> 01:06:06.420]   You won't end up tricked and you'll probably end up in a better place.
[01:06:06.420 --> 01:06:07.420]   All right.
[01:06:07.420 --> 01:06:08.820]   So that's our place for us in this episode.
[01:06:08.820 --> 01:06:11.980]   I think is to wrap it up as we went a little bit long here.
