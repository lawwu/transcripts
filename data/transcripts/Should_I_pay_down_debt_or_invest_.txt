[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320]   Hello everybody it's Sam from Financial Samurai and in this episode I want to
[00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:10.680]   talk about one of my favorite topics paying down or paying off mortgage debt.
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:17.200]   Now I am a proponent of paying off mortgage debt faster and sooner and
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.620]   especially before you retire. I believe the more you pay off your mortgage the
[00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:27.320]   more courage you will have and I talked about this in an article regarding
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.560]   buying a house with cash and actually not feeling that bad during the height
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.920]   of the downturn in March 2020 so far. And I was just talking to my wife and I was
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:43.280]   wondering you know things are really bad but they don't seem too bad and I was
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.440]   thinking to myself what was it that made me feel more sanguine versus back in
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.760]   2008 and 2009 when we didn't have any kids and it was just us to provide for.
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.920]   You would think that with two kids we would be freaking out even more right
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.840]   two kids, two mouths to feed, tuition, just unknown expenses out the wazoo. But that
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.320]   one thing that kept us more calm I think was not having a mortgage and this is
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.120]   the first time we have never had a mortgage in our entire lives in our
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.840]   private residence. In the past our expenses our housing expenses were about
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:26.080]   I don't know 10% of our gross income something like that and that's the level
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.960]   I think that everybody should try to shoot for 10% or less just like the
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.960]   1/10 rule for car buying. If you've got your housing expense whether it's rent
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.560]   or your mortgage, property tax and all that below 10% of your gross income I
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.880]   think you're gonna feel a really good sense of calm and so we took this a step
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.920]   further and lowered it to about 3% or maybe it's like 2% of our gross
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.720]   income I don't know what it is but it's much lower and we feel even better. So
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:58.560]   you've got to ask yourself how much is the feeling of calm and peace of mind
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.560]   worth to you? As we age we should get wealthier and as we age our lives get a
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.840]   little bit more difficult and complicated because we might have health
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.160]   issues or we might have to take care of our aging parents or kids for that
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:18.680]   matter. Whatever the case may be life is not gonna be what you expect it to be at
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.320]   least not exactly that is. For example for us we didn't expect to have two kids
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:28.240]   at this age and I'm almost gonna be 43 and my wife's almost gonna be 40. I
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.480]   thought maybe we'd have one kid or no kids and just life just changes so
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.840]   always expect some change. So with regards to paying off mortgage debt and
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.160]   investing I believe you should do both. If you are in the early part of your
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.840]   wealth accumulating stage or in the middle part you should do both and I
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.680]   have this thing called the FS-DARE methodology which is called Financial
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.600]   Samurai's Debt and Investment Ratio and basically it's a smart way to think
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.560]   about investing and paying off debt no matter where you are in your life. FS-DARE
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.440]   is based on the debt interest rate you have. So if you have debt then you
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.520]   want to tackle that debt based on the level of interest. The lower the interest
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.560]   rate the lower the debt pay down allocation and vice versa. So for example
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:22.720]   let's say you have debt at 6%. Well I think you can allocate 60% of your cash
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:29.600]   flow to paying off debt and 40% to investing. If you have 8% interest rate
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:36.080]   well 80% debt pay down allocation and 20% investment allocation. Once you get
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.480]   to 10% I think you've really got to tackle your debt head-on. 10% is a very
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.040]   very high debt interest rate especially when the 10-year bond yield which is the
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.280]   risk-free rate of return is at around 0.7% now it got down to about 0.48%
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:58.960]   during mid-March 2020 and I believe it's gonna hover below 1% for this
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:04.720]   year 2020 next year and beyond. I firmly believe we are in a low interest rate
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.280]   environment for life. I've been saying that since I started financial seminar
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.280]   in 2009 and I continue to believe this. People think our interest rates are
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.280]   gonna skyrocket you got to get a 30-year fixed and pay more because you want to
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.440]   lock it in for 30 years and so forth. I don't believe that. I don't believe that
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:27.400]   because we are a much more efficient world now. So we are learning from what
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:33.400]   our mistakes were. We have technology that blasts information in nanoseconds.
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.840]   We're all interconnected so when globally countries are lowering their
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:43.040]   interest rates we must follow suit because of US dollar denominated debt
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.320]   capital accounts, current accounts and so forth. So we're all interconnected. We've
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.520]   learned from our mistakes. We're more efficient now and we are able to tackle
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.600]   inflation much easier as a result. Therefore interest rates should stay low
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:02.460]   for longer. Once again if you've got debt interest rate at 10% or higher I would
[00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.680]   focus 90% really a hundred percent of paying off that debt. You really
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.920]   shouldn't have debt that expensive which means automatically pay off all your
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:16.000]   credit card debt because the average credit card interest rate is around 16-17%
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.640]   I mean that's ridiculous folks. Ridiculous. Do not have revolving credit
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.680]   card debt. Please crush that debt every single month. Be responsible and then
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.360]   tackle your other debt. Your other debt should not have interest rates that high
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:32.400]   including auto loans, mortgage loans and so forth. Personal loans as well. Personal
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.760]   loans should be below 10% as well. Once again if you are in your rapid wealth
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:42.200]   accumulation phase focus on paying off debt and investing at the same time. It's
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:46.520]   a logical framework. Go for it. You're gonna feel good about it over the years.
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.420]   Now if you are at the stage where you are past the rapid wealth accumulation
[00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:56.240]   phase, you're more on the capital preservation phase, then no matter what
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.960]   the interest rate is I recommend allocating more to paying off debt. I
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.680]   have never once regretted paying off debt whether that was in 2015 when I
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:11.760]   paid off my condo mortgage debt or back in 2008 when I paid off my MBA student
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:16.240]   loan debt. That was around $40,000. I've never once regretted it even though I
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.760]   could have made more money in the stock market. Hey I could have lost money right?
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:24.120]   If I didn't pay down $40,000 in debt in 2008 maybe I would have invested that
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:29.760]   money in the beginning of 2008 and lost 50%. You just never really know. But
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:35.760]   knowing is part of what we all crave for right now especially during a global
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:40.800]   pandemic. It's that uncertainty of how many deaths there will be. It's that
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.480]   uncertainty of going to the grocery store and thinking to yourself, will I
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:49.920]   get COVID-19 by just touching the cart? Will I accidentally touch my face or my
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:54.720]   nose or my eyes and get the virus? It's the uncertainty of when the lockdown
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:07:00.640]   will end. Will we be trapped at home for another two three months because the
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:05.520]   vaccine is not going to be out until 2021 at the earliest? That uncertainty is
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:10.360]   what we all crave and paying off your debt and paying off your mortgage is
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:15.720]   that certainty that you will achieve and that peace of mind is amazing. I'm
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:20.400]   telling you folks it is an unbelievable amount of peace of mind. The other thing
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:25.200]   about paying down your mortgage or having no mortgage really is having more
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:31.840]   courage. For example in mid-march 2020 when the market was selling off 10% a
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:38.480]   day it was nuts. It was crazy. It was scary. I was concerned. What's going on
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:43.920]   here? At this rate we're gonna go to zero in like a month. It was just wild wild
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:48.880]   wild wild. But having no mortgage gave me the courage this time, unlike in 2008 and
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:53.840]   2009, to actually invest a decent amount of money beyond my 401k normal
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:58.480]   contributions into the stock market. On March 18th for example I lobbed about a
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:02.480]   hundred hundred ten thousand dollars into multiple tranches in the S&P 500
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:07.840]   index. Whereas if I had put down only 20% on my primary residence and carried a
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:13.000]   1.4 million dollar mortgage I highly doubt I would have had the guts to
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.080]   invest when the market was falling apart. I wouldn't have been able to write a
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:23.600]   logical analysis of calculating a stock market bottom in one of those posts that
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:29.000]   talked about buying the S&P 500 below 2400. Further if I had had a mortgage on
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   our primary residence that would have meant I wouldn't have sold about a
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.800]   million dollars in stock in 2019 to help pay for the house and cash. So definitely
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:42.160]   I would not have had the courage to buy maybe more than five thousand ten
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:45.480]   thousand dollars worth of stock because I would just be kind of frozen wondering
[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:51.720]   uh-oh too much leverage too much debt going to downturn not a good idea. But
[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:55.680]   here's the thing about not having a mortgage or paying down your mortgage
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:00.800]   debt. It's not just feeling good sleeping well at night it's not just having the
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:04.920]   courage to invest in risk assets when they're detonating. There are other
[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:10.120]   things that will really benefit from having less debt or no debt. Here are
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:15.000]   three easy examples I can think of. One, the courage to quit your job. If you've
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.560]   got no debt you won't tolerate all the BS at work. If you've got a bad manager
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:24.440]   or backstabbing colleagues you'll just say you know what screw you guys I'm
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:28.560]   out of here. Well hopefully you do so in a nice way where you negotiate a
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:33.120]   severance you get a severance you get $600 more a week in enhanced
[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:39.040]   unemployment benefits and so forth. Trust me folks when you've got debt you've got
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:43.960]   responsibilities and all that it's much harder to quit. Okay two, if you have no
[00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:48.040]   debt you have more courage to start a business. Most people don't want to start
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:51.800]   a small business because they don't have an idea, they don't have the funds, they
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:55.800]   don't have the time, they fear rejection and so forth. It's just endless excuse
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:59.840]   after endless excuse but thanks to the internet the cost to start has gone way
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:03.840]   down. Thanks to the pandemic you are locked down you've got nothing else
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:07.720]   better to do and you can be on the internet all you want. If you have no
[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:12.920]   debt and low startup costs then your courage to start goes way up. And then
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:18.440]   finally you have the courage to break up. Break up from a bad relationship. Let's
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:21.960]   say you're saddled with debt and you have an unstable job despite hating your
[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:25.720]   partner, despite your partner verbally and maybe physically unfortunately
[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:30.480]   abusing you, you stay in your loveless relationship for the financial security.
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:37.160]   How sad is that? But you know, you know that that is true. It's true among
[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:42.200]   society because relationships are complicated and money is important. So if
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:45.920]   you have no debt and you have your finances in order you can break free
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:50.400]   from your relationship and find happiness elsewhere. So in conclusion I
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:56.520]   say pay down debt sooner rather than later. You're gonna feel better, you're
[00:10:56.520 --> 00:11:01.560]   gonna gain more courage, you're gonna have much much more flexibility. Thanks
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:06.800]   so much everyone for listening. Stay safe, keep tight and if you like this episode
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:10.720]   and other episodes I'd appreciate a positive review and feedback. Take care.
