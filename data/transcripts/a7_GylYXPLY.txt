[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   I call your attention this morning to that great story concerning the prophet Daniel,
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.300]   the account of which we have read most of it in the sixth chapter of the book of the
[00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:21.000]   prophet Daniel. Let me read the closing paragraph of that chapter, beginning at verse 25.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   "Then King Darius wrote unto all people, nations, and languages that dwell in all the earth,
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   Peace be multiplied unto you. I make a decree that in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   and fear before the God of Daniel, for he is the living God and steadfast forever; and
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   his kingdom, that which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion shall be even unto the end.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth,
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions. So this Daniel prospered in the
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian." Now this story concerning Daniel
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   is one which is familiar to everybody. It's such a great and dramatic story. We all first
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   met it as children, and we continue to know it throughout our lives. But I sometimes have
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   a fear that the very greatness of the story and its dramatic character may very well stand
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   between us and our learning the lesson which the story is meant to convey. That's a danger
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   with some of these greatest stories in the Bible. We can be so charmed and captivated
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   and moved by their very dramatic quality that we tend to miss the point. And I call attention
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   to this not only because it is indeed one of the greatest stories in the whole of literature,
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   but because of the lesson which I believe it is meant to convey to us. And that lesson
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   is a very practical one. Those of us who are Christian in this modern world must know and
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   realize increasingly that the state of the world is not surprising. It's what we expected.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   The Bible has taught us to expect it. And we know that nothing can really help men and
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   women in such a world of crisis as the message of this book, Our Christian Faith. So the
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   great problem is, how are we to get this message over to the masses of the people? That's
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   the great question that should be on the minds of every Christian at this present critical
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   time in the history of our country and of the world. Here is the solution, but how can
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   we get it over? Well now, it's because it throws great light upon that very question
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   that I'm calling your attention to this story. As you know, there are many who are
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   very concerned about this problem of getting the message over to the masses of the people.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   This is the great concern of the Christian Church, speaking generally at the present
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   time. And as you know, many means and methods have been resorted to and have been tried.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   People no longer come to a place of worship. Very well, they say, that makes the individual
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   testimony so much more important. And that is right. People don't come as they used
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   to. But we all mix with people. We work with them, we live next door to them, we meet them
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   in various ways. Well, therein lies our opportunity. So the great question is, how as individuals
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   can we bear our witness and bring people to a knowledge of this truth, which alone can
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   give them peace and satisfaction and help them to deal with their problems? Well now,
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   as I said, there are many, many ideas with respect to this. You can buy little booklets
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   on how to do personal work, how to be a successful soul-willer, and so on. Movements have come
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   into being which have trained people how to do this work. Tell them to memorize certain
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   verses, recite some of these verses to people, and then if they say so-and-so, you reply
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   with this verse. It's all been organized and men and women are being trained. There
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   are churches which have held classes to train people and give them examinations and diplomas
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   and have sent them out to do this personal work. Well, I'm not here to criticize these
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   things, but I am here to suggest that we may very well be forgetting the biblical method.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   And after all, the church is a very old institution, and the Bible is older. And we find here how
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   men and women have borne their testimony and their witness throughout the centuries. And
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   I want to call your attention to one of the most notable illustrations of this which is
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   to be found anywhere in this sixth chapter of the book of the prophet Daniel. Now, let
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   me put it like this. There are many people today who are feeling rather hopeless about
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   the whole situation. They say, "Here we are as Christian people. Even the statistics tell
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   us at their best that we are only about 10% of the people of this country today, and of
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   that only about a half attend a place of worship with any regularity." Very well, they say.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   Here we are a handful of people in a great pagan society. The country's become pagan.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   What can we do? How can we possibly have any effect or any influence? We are so small in
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   number, and there's so much that is against us. And there are many Christian people who
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   are not only despondent, they really feel quite hopeless about the whole thing and are
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   prophesying the end of the Christian church in some 20 years or so. Well now, let's have
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   a look at that in the light of this story. Look at what we have here. What is this story?
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   Well, the essence of the story is this. Now this man Daniel, and just two or three companions,
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   was able to change the whole outlook of a great pagan king and his entire empire. That's
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   the point of this story. This king Darius was a pagan, and he was the head of a great
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   empire. He was a kind of dictator, and they worshipped their various gods. And they've
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   got a great culture, a great history. Well now, there amongst them was just a handful
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   of these Jews. Their country had been conquered, and they'd been carried away as captives,
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   and they were slaves in this great pagan empire. Now you can't imagine a more hopeless situation.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   How could they possibly have any effect or influence upon this great pagan dynasty? But
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   the story is that they succeeded in changing the whole situation. And here is a king issuing
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   a decree, commanding all his people to bow down before and worship the god of Daniel.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   In an impossible situation, they succeeded. And the whole empire becomes a worshipping
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   empire, worshipping the only true and living God. Well now, this is a fact of history.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   And the question therefore for us is this, how did it happen? Whatever our difficulties
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   and problems may be, they were not greater than those confronting Daniel and his companions.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   Yet, it was a brilliant success. How did it happen? That's what I want to consider with
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   you. But before I do so, I want to ask a simple question. We all mix with people, they all
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   know us. This is the question I'm here to ask. Do people speak about newer God, as this
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   king spoke about the god of Daniel? See, that's his decree. He isn't content with saying
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   that they should worship God. I make a decree that in every dominion of my kingdom, men
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   tremble in fear before the god of Daniel. He said, "This is the god, the god of this
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   man." Do people speak of newer God like that? That to me is the great challenge that should
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   come to every one of us who claims to be a Christian at the present time. Are we having
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   such an effect upon people that they say, "Ah, that's the god, the god of this man,
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   the god of this woman." Well, now then, how did it come to pass? And we are told here
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   very simply and very plainly. What was it about Daniel? What did Daniel do? What is
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   it that explains this amazing result? The first answer that we find is this. That Daniel was
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   a better workman, better at his work than anybody else. That's the first thing we
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   are told. The first step that led to this astonishing result was the fact that Daniel
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   was better at his daily work and task and employment than anybody else. Listen to what
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   we are told. "It pleased the royals to set up the kingdom and 120 princes which would
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   govern the whole kingdom. Over these he set three presidents, of whom Daniel was first.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes." Why? "Because an excellent
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   spirit was in him, and the king thought to set him over the whole realm." Then you remember
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   that we are told that these other presidents and princes became very jealous of Daniel
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   because of his promotion, and they were anxious to get him down. But this is what I read in
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   verse 4. "Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   the kingdom. But they could find none occasion nor fault, forasmuch as he was faithful. Neither
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   was there any error or fault found in him." Now that's the secret. This is the beginning.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   This is in many ways the most important point of all. Daniel stood out because he was faithful,
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   more conscientious, more reliable, better at his work than anybody else. That's the
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   first thing that attracted people's attention to Daniel and through Daniel to his God.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   Now this to me is such an important point that I don't apologize for telling you two
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   or three stories to illustrate this matter. It's not my custom to tell stories, but I'm
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   going to break my own rules in order to bring this point right home. It seems to me that
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   we're in danger of forgetting this. The danger is we tend to divide ourselves up into
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   two compartments. There we are at our work all day. Then we finish and we go home. Then
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   we begin to become Christians and do personal work. We've been trained to think that you
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   do your personal work after you've finished your work, after you've gone home and in
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   your leisure time. That's a terrible fallacy. The place of all places to witness is at your
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   work, where you spend most of your time in your regular employment, as Daniel did.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   Well, now let me tell you my story. There's a lady I know living in a certain part of
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   this country, a very fine Christian lady and bearing a fine Christian witness, but she
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   wasn't always like that. She, many years ago, worked in Harrods stores in London. And
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   one afternoon she was taken suddenly ill, with severe pain in her side. She was rushed
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   to hospital and they diagnosed that she'd got acute appendicitis and they removed her
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   appendix very successfully. And here she was now in a ward convalescing. And she was an
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   intelligent woman and she just looked round and she gradually came to the conclusion that
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   there was one nurse who kept coming on to the ward to do her duty, who was different
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   from all the others. And she was so impressed by this that one afternoon, when the nurse
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   was attending to her, she began to speak to her and asked her this question. She said,
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   "Nurse, tell me, why are you different from all the other nurses?" "Well, am I?" said
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   the nurse. "Oh yes," said the patient. "Well, in what way?" said the nurse. "Well," she
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   said, "you know, I've noticed these other girls, they're very nice girls, but it seems
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   to me they've always got their eye on the clock. They're always waiting to go off duty.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   And when the time gets near their off-duty period, they seem to down tools and to leave
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   everything. That seems to be the big thing in their lives. But you," she said, "you don't
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   seem to be like that. You're concerned about us. It doesn't matter what the clock says.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   You don't go off duty until you've put us all comfortable and you've finished what you've
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   got to do. Your whole attitude seems to me to be different from the other nurses." "Why
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   is it?" "Well," said the nurse, "if you will persist in saying that, the only answer I
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   can give you is this, that I'm a Christian." "Oh no," said the patient, "that isn't the
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   answer. Because I also am a Christian. But I'm afraid I wouldn't be like you, I'd be
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   like the other nurses." "Oh well," said the nurse, "you know there are Christians and
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   Christians." And the conversation began. The nurse said to the patient, "well, what sort
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   of a Christian are you?" "Well," said the patient, "I'm a Roman Catholic." And she was.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   She'd been brought up on the west coast of Ireland and brought up as a Roman Catholic.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   So they began to have a discussion. And this continued. Every time the nurse went to the
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   patient, this discussion went on. And it ended in the nurse saying to the patient, "well
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   now, in a few days you'll be fit enough to come with me to the service of the church
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   where I attend. And you'll see what I mean by my kind of Christianity." And this happened.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   And the patient was converted. Not the first time, but quite soon afterwards. Now you see
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   the point of the story. The nurse did not turn to the patient and say, "are you saved?"
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   The nurse never started the conversation. It was the patient who started it. Why did
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   she start the conversation? Because she noticed that this was the most conscientious nurse
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   that came onto the ward. The nurse had a better spirit in her. She was more reliable. She
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   was more honest. She was more meticulous. She was the best nurse. And this had so impressed
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   the patient that she put the question. And the nurse simply giving her answer, the discussion
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   began. And it led to the conversion of the patient. Well now, there's one example. Exactly
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   the same, you see, as with Daniel. But listen to my second story. At one time I had the
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   privilege of being on the London Council of what was then known as the China Inland Mission.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   And I shall never forget one day when a young lady appeared before us. It was her last interview
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   before she went to China to act as a missionary. And she was a very able woman. And a very
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   fine Christian. But again, she hadn't always been like that. This girl was a graduate of
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   Cambridge University. And she'd gone up to Cambridge as an undergraduate. And she was
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   a very brilliant girl. She'd taken a very fine scholarship. But she was also an atheist.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   And not only an atheist, but a communist. And she was actually, became the secretary
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   of the Cambridge University Communist Association. And she rejoiced in her communism. Well, she
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   happened to be there in the winter of 1946-47. Some of you older people will remember the
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   terribly severe winter we had, particularly in the early part of 1947. Everything was
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   frozen up. Acute shortage of water. And the result was that in this college in Cambridge,
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   the authorities had to ration the amount of water. And nobody was allowed to have more
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   than one bath per week. And this was so in this particular college, where this girl was
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   a student. And the result was, of course, that everybody was anxious to get this bath.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   If you could get two, all the better. Everybody was aggressive, pushing themselves forward,
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   except one girl. There was one girl who wanted to have her bath, but she didn't push herself.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   She wasn't aggressive and almost arrogant. And this communist girl, who was herself very
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   aggressive, she noticed this other girl. And she was amazed at this. She said to herself,
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   "This girl is actually doing what I say should be done, but which I'm not doing.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   I'm selfish. I'm not sharing like I preach and as I tell other people they should do.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   She's doing it." She was so impressed by this that she went to ask the girl, "Why
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   was she so demure and quiet? And why was she less aggressive?" And the girl said, "Well,"
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   she said, "Well, I'm a Christian." And this hit this communist. She was amazed at
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   this, taken aback. And the result was that she went constantly to talk to this quiet
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   Christian girl. She was also an undergraduate, an able girl, nothing like as able as the
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   communist. But she was there, and she just answered questions. And the upshot was that
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   as a result of their friendship and their constant talk, the communist was converted
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   and became a Christian. And here she was, going out to be a missionary in China. Now
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   don't misunderstand me, but the point I'm making is this. This quiet Christian girl
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   had never gone up to the communist, tackling her and saying, "Are you saved? Are you
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   a Christian?" Never. The move was made by the communist. Why? Because of the behavior
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   of the Christian, she attracted attention by being different, less aggressive, less
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   selfish.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   Well, there's my second story. Let me tell you my third. Some of you may remember that
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   during the last war, we were astonished to read in the papers that Stalin, that cruel
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   dictator of Russia, that for some inexplicable reason, decided to relax his rules and regulations
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   against the Christians. It was an astonishing thing to read. I remember reading it very
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   well, and we were all amazed at it, couldn't understand why. But after the war, we had
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   the explanation. There was a great Christian man who lived in Budapest. He was a professor
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   of anatomy, Professor Kish. And he came over to this country early in 1946. And some of
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   us had the privilege of meeting him. And I remember putting the question to him, "Had
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   he heard of this? And did he know why it had happened?" And he smiled, "Of course," he
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   said. "We all heard of it. It was applied," he said, "in our country," which was then
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   occupied by the Russians. And I said, "Well, what was the explanation?" "Oh," he said,
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   "it was this. Stalin, as you know, had people under him, and then there were those under
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   those, these commissars. And some of them were spies. In every factory, there'd be a
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   spy, perhaps two or three, just watching people, how they did their work, what they said, and
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   so on. And they would send their reports to their superiors, and to their superiors,
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   and the reports eventually got to Stalin. And this is what that crafty, intelligent
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   man, Stalin, had observed. The reports seemed to be unanimous in saying this, that the best,
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   the most reliable, the most conscientious workers in the munition factories and other
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   factories were these despised Christians. It was a sure fact. They were the best work
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   people. And Stalin was so impressed by this that he said, "We must relax the rules."
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   And he gave them a greater freedom of worship than they'd ever enjoyed before.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   Well, you see, my stories all say the same thing, don't they? The thing that called
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   attention to the Christian message and to God was the faithfulness of these ordinary
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   Christian people. They didn't talk, they didn't do things by numbers. They were just
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   so much better and so different that other people were attracted and put their questions,
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   and so they were able to bear their testimony.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   Well, now, my dear friends, this seems to me to be the most important thing of everything
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   at the present time. We somehow have got the idea that everything's got to be organized.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   How foolish we are. Why don't we come back to the biblical principles? The first thing
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   that you and I are called upon to do is to be different, is to be better. And what an
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   opportunity we have today. The individual Christian has never had a greater opportunity.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   Look at the society in which we live. Look at the dishonesty in every realm and department
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   of life. Look at it in work, whether it's at the bench or in the office or in the boardroom.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   Look at the dishonesty that's rampant. People doing the minimum amount of work for the maximum
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   amount of money. Slack at their work, not caring. Lying, petty theft and robbery. All
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   the unreliability that is so characteristic of our society today, from the very top to
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   the very bottom. What are we to do, you say? Well, I'll tell you, the first thing you've
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   got to do is to be different, is to be honest, is to be reliable, is to be thorough, is to
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   be the best workman, whatever particular work you've got to do. You've got to call attention
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   to yourself, not by speaking in the first instance. You know, the man of the world,
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   he's very wise. And he says, "Ah, these people, they talk a lot." But talk is cheap, he says.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   "I want to know what people are like." He said, "I know these Christians, always trying
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   to get me to be a Christian, but I notice when they're taken ill, they're as upset as
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   we are. When there's a death in the family, they're as hopeless as we are. When there's
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   unemployment, they're the same as we are. When there's some crisis or calamity, they
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   don't seem to have anything that helps them. That's the thing. Talk is of no value. But
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   when they see it in practice, as they did in the case of Daniel, as they did in the
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   cases I've been citing, well, they begin to pay attention. And you know, I'm certain of
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   this, that as things get worse in this country, and they're going to get worse this winter
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   and the winters that are going to follow, here comes our opportunity. How do we stand
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   up to adversity? How do we do our work? Are we detentable? Are we reliable? Are we the
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   best people in every respect, especially at our work? This is the way to witness. Not
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   so much talk, not something you take up in a bag when you've finished your work and are
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   washed and changed and go out to do personal work. No, no. It's actual work, where you
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   spend your time and where people know you. You know, I've had to say this many times
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   during the past years. I've known many young men and women, but particularly young men,
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   who've gone up to Oxford or Cambridge as students, and we all expected that when they
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   came to take their final exams, they'd take first-class honours. But sometimes we've
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   been amazed to hear that this young fellow, instead of taking a first, but taken a third,
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   or perhaps just a past degree. And we say, "Well, what's the matter? What happened?"
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   And the explanation that's been given is this. He was so busy doing evangelistic work.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   Now this, to me, is all wrong. Students are not sent to universities to do evangelistic
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   work. They're sent there to study. And many of them go with grants from public funds.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   And I wouldn't hesitate to say this, that for a student to spend his time evangelising,
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   using public funds which are meant to give him education, it's dishonest, it is sinful,
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   and it's a bad witness. His business is to be the best student, to be outstanding in
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   his conscientiousness, his thoroughness, his application. And then, when he's taken his
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   best degree, he goes out into life, and as a Christian man, he bears a much greater witness.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   Well now, I'm emphasising this not only because it's emphasised here, but because it's what
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   I find as I read the whole history of the Christian Church. This is the thing that has
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   generally led to the great result, that these people, however small in number, simply stand
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   as being different. Reliable, honest, conscientious spirit, with a good spirit within them.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   Well now, that's the first thing that was in Daniel that led to this ultimate result.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   But I mustn't stop at that. It's equally clear that everybody knew that Daniel was a better
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   man at his work than anybody else because of his faith, because of his belief. You see,
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   nobody could say, "Oh well, of course he's born like that, that's his temperament, that's
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   his psychology." No, no. It was clear to everybody that Daniel behaved as he did because of his
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   belief in his God, because of his faith. You know, even these cruel presidents and princes
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   who were so jealous of him that they concocted this plot to get rid of him, even they paid
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   him this compliment. This is what I read in verse 5. "Then said these men, 'We shall not
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the law
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   of his God.' They said, 'We'll never catch him out of his work, never. He'll never be
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   negligent of his work. He'll never skimp it. He'll never just do it anyhow. We can give
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   it up. You'll never catch him out of his work. There's only one way to catch this man. It's
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   his faith, his religion. That's the place to catch him.'" Why? Well, it's the biggest
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   thing in his life. It's the controlling factor. He is what he is because of the law of his
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   God. Very well. This is equally true about us. You know, there are so many of us who
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   give the impression that religion is a sort of a side, as I say, something that we take
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   up in a bag when we've finished work or on Sunday. And then we put the bag down again
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   and do our work and do the general tenor of our life like everybody else. Now that's not
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   Christianity. A Christian is a man who is governed and controlled by his faith, by his
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   belief. He doesn't have to remind himself of it. It's there at the center. Everything
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   comes out of it. It's the controlling factor, the governing influence. And if we don't give
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   this impression, we won't be able to influence people. These are the men who've always influenced
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   society and countries. The men were obsessed, as it were, by this. This is the center of
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   the whole of the earth being the governing factor. And then, of course, it's equally
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   clear about this man Daniel that he was very certain about this faith of his. It wasn't
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   something vague, indefinite, uncertain. It was the law of his God. And he knew what it
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   was. You read this book and you'll find from the very first chapter onwards, Daniel never
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   had to go and spend time trying to remember what his faith was or trying to determine
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   what it was in order that he might know what to do at any given point. He knew exactly
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   all of it. Why? Well, he was certain of his faith. It was clear cut. It was definite.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   The law of his God. Oh, how essential this is today. I'm not surprised that the vast
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   majority of people are outside the Christian churches in this country today. They don't
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   know what Christianity is. And why don't they know? Well, they listen to the television
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   and the wireless, and they hear people in the name of Christianity and in the name of
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   the church. Perhaps great dignitaries and officials in the various branches of the Christian
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   church. Some of them don't even believe in God, but they call themselves Christians.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   Many of them deny the deity of Christ, yet they call themselves Christians. They don't
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   believe in miracles. They don't believe in his atoning death. They don't believe
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   he literally rose in the body from the grave. They don't believe in the person of the
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   Holy Spirit. How can people know what Christianity is? It's not surprising they turn their
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   backs upon the church. You know, it's no use a church which doesn't discipline herself
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   calling upon men and women to discipline themselves. People are not going to listen to such appeals.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   They say, "Let them start with themselves. If they believe in discipline, let them discipline
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   their own preachers." And I think it's a fair argument. Well, Daniel knew what he
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   believed. And if you and I don't know what we believe, we're not going to influence
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   anybody. Christianity was not just an appeal for moral behavior. It's not just an appeal
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   for us to pull together to save the country. That's not Christianity. Christianity is
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   a body of belief and doctrine. There are certain truths which are absolutely essential. And
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   it's the church that believes such truths, as you, my good friends, do. And I thank God
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   for it. This is the kind of church that has an impact and an influence upon the men and
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   women who are around and about us in society. Daniel knew exactly what he believed. Yes.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   And the next thing follows. He wouldn't compromise concerning it. Now, I believe that he was
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   tempted to compromise. Here he is, you see. He suddenly hears about this plot. These clever
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   men, princes and presidents, they worked out a plot to catch him. And the plot was this.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   They'd gone to take a document to the king and he was going to sign it and put his signet
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   upon it. And this was it. That for thirty days, nobody was to bow down before and make
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   any request or petition to any god or man except the king himself. Daniel heard this.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   What was he to do? And I imagine that the temptation that came to him took this form.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   Wait a minute now. Here you are, you're told not to bow down and worship to your god for
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   thirty days. His first instinct was to say, "I'm not going to obey this." But then another
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   voice spoke and said, "Wait a minute. You've got into a good position. You've had promotion
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   because of your reliability. And it's in the king's mind to promote you yet higher so that
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   you'll become the first man in the country next to the king himself. And of course, when
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   you get to that position, you'll have great influence. You'll be able to bring in your
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   belief slowly and gradually. The opportunity is going to be tremendous. Are you going to
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   throw all that away simply for thirty days? They're not prohibiting you to worship god
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   for the rest of your life. It's only thirty days. Look here. Be sensible. Use a little
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   common sense. You can go on worshipping god inside for thirty days. Nobody will know you're
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   doing it. But don't bow down. Don't let it be seen. That's the thing to do. For the sake
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   of this ultimate good, this greater influence you're going to have, just obey it. It's only
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   thirty days." Not so, Daniel. Daniel saw that the principle involved was a denial of his
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   god. Even for thirty days he wouldn't consider it. He saw certainly with his faith he won't
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   compromise to the slightest extent where the honor and the glory of his god are involved.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   And then the next step. Daniel is so certain of his faith, he won't compromise. No, he
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   even prefers to die rather than compromise. He knows that to be thrown to the lions in
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   the den will mean certain death. They'll tear him limb from limb. But it's only thirty days.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   Well, no, says Daniel, I'd sooner be torn limb from limb than deny my god and his glory.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   He prefers death to any kind of recompensation or compromise or denial. This is his certainty
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   concerning his faith. I don't know. It's not for me to prophesy. But it may well be, my
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   friends, that you and I will be confronted by such a choice. There are many thousands
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   of people in various parts of the world today that are having to face this very situation.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   It may happen to us. So we must be certain. Do we know what we believe? Are we certain
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   of our faith? Would we sooner die rather than deny it and deny our glorious god?
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   But before I close, let me put this to you. Notice Daniel's absolute confidence in this
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   god in whom he believed. Look at his quiet confidence. It's amazing. I see it all here
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   in verse ten. It's all summarized in verse ten. Let me read it.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   "Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house, and his windows
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   being opened in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   and prayed and gave thanks before his god," listen, "as he did aforetime, as he'd always
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   done, as had always been his practice." That's the thing I like. Here it is. He hears the
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   decree. He knows he's going to be thrown into the den with the lions. So he went quietly
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   to his house, opened the windows toward Jerusalem, and went down on his knees and prayed three
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   times a day as he'd always done. I wonder what the story would be if it had
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   happened to be me or you in Daniel's situation. You know, I'm afraid it would be this.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   That when he heard the decree, he knew the writing was signed, he went into his house
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   and kneeled upon his knees thirty times a day, three hundred times a day, excited, frantic,
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   alarmed, terrified, pleading with God. Not so, Daniel. He'd always done this three times
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   a day. He still does it three times a day. He's not excited, he's not alarmed, he's
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   not frantic, he's not desperate. This is the test of our faith, and this is what the
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   world is watching. When things go wrong, as I say, an illness in the family, some loved
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   one desperately ill, are we frantic, are we excited, or do we show this calmness, this
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   confidence, this quiet reliance upon our God and his gracious promises? Three times a day,
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   as he did aforetime, this man knows his God, and whatever may be happening round and about
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   him, he goes on exactly as before. This is the trial, this is the test, the
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   men of lions, the fiery furnace of war, unemployment, terrible condition. This is the test that
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   comes upon us and shows the value, the depth, the character of our faith. There are men,
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   they talk libly and loosely, and they seem to be most enthusiastic for a while, and then
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   they suddenly disappear. But when the time of trial and of testing comes, they've got
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   nothing. But you see, it's the man who goes on as before, he's the man who has influence
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   upon those who are round and about him. But wait a minute. Did you notice the second
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   thing? This is most amazing. He kneeled upon his knees three times a day and prayed, and
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   gave thanks, gave thanks before his God. He's on the verge of being thrown into the
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   den to the lions. He's facing the end of life. But he gives thanks unto God. Though
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   he knows he's going to be torn limb from limb in the most horrible manner, he thanks
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   God. Well, you say, this is impossible. This is a psychological case. No, no. This is a
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   man who knows his God and who trusts in him. But you say, how can a man possibly thank
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   God in such circumstances? Oh, I'll tell you. He thanked God that God was so different
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   from everybody else. So different from the king, so different from the presidents and
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   princes, these cruel, jealous, envious, selfish men. Thank God that God is so different. And
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   we can thank him for that at a time like this, when men are failing us, when you feel that
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   you can scarcely trust anybody. Oh, how wonderful to turn to a God who is eternally different
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   in his holiness and in his truth. He thanked him for that, but not only that. He thanked
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   God that he could turn to him in his crisis. And this is a wonderful thing. You know, the
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   trouble with the poor men of the world, I never denounce the men of the world, I'm
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   sorry for them. These poor people who live, look at these wretched film stars, who are
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   supposed to have such a wonderful life. I'm more sorry, I think, for them than anybody
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   else. They've never known happiness. They've never known joy. They've never known peace.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   They can't rely upon anybody else, not upon themselves. They think they're in love.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   They find tomorrow they're not. What a tragedy. And when things go wrong, they've got nobody
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   to turn to. And you know, there are thousands of people like that in this country today.
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   If we're going to have serious unemployment, if people are going to lose their money and
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   their businesses, if they have to send back the television set and the washing machine,
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   which they've got on higher purchase, they literally have nothing. They've been living
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   on money and what money can buy. Suddenly it goes. There's nobody to turn to. This
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   is the glory of the Christian position. When all things seem against me to drive me to
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   despair, I know one gate is open. One ear will hear my prayer. Thank God that you can
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   always turn to him. He's always there. He'll never move. He's the everlasting, unchangeable
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   God. Then think of the blessings he's given you. Count them. Name your blessings. Count
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   your blessings. Name them one by one. And the more you do so, the more you'll thank
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   him. Thank him for all these glorious things. And finally, these men may put me to death
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   and they can't touch my soul. They're simply ushering me into the presence of God a little
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   sooner than it would have happened otherwise. Thank him for the glorious prospect that awaits
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   me. That's it. You know the apostle Paul puts the same thing that we find here in practice
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   in the case of Daniel. Paul puts it in the fourth chapter of the epistle to the Philippians
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   in these words, "In nothing be anxious," and it's all inclusive, "in nothing be anxious,
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   but in all things," again, all inclusive, "with prayer and supplication and thanksgiving
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   let your requests be made known unto God." Don't let your requests be made known until
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   you've thanked him. Many people say, "I prayed to God and my prayer wasn't answered." It's
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   very often due to this that they never thanked him. They never worshipped him. They ran into
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   the presence of God with their petition and they wanted it at once and they're annoyed
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   if they don't get it. Such people don't get answers. Prayer, supplication, thanksgiving.
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   Let your requests be made known unto God and the peace of God that passeth all understanding
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   shall keep your hearts and minds in the knowledge of Christ Jesus.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   And finally, the opening of the windows toward Jerusalem. Why did Daniel open his windows
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   toward Jerusalem? Well, you know the Jews, they had a tendency to think that God was
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   confined to Jerusalem. They were men and women like ourselves. This was a weakness. But they
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   tended to locate God to Jerusalem. He was there in the temple. That's where God had
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   done his great things for his people. It was the city of God. So they tended to think of
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   God as in Jerusalem. So Daniel, you see, in his great crisis, he's going to pray, but
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   he opens the windows while he's expecting an answer. That's where it's going to come
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   from. Open the windows toward Jerusalem. Have you got faith in your prayers? When you're
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   in a desperate crisis and you go on your knees to pray to God, do you open the windows? Have
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   you such faith in God that you know he can do the impossible? Daniel had. So he opened
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   the windows toward Jerusalem. Now, these are the things in Daniel that so impressed the
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   king and everybody else that ultimately the whole situation was changed. And the king
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   commands everybody to worship this God of Daniel. And so, you see, the king himself
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   gives us the explanation of the whole thing. It isn't Daniel. It's the God of Daniel.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   Well, why? Who else is this king? I make a decree that in every dominion of my kingdom,
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   men tremble in fear before the God of Daniel. Why? He is the living God and steadfast forever.
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   And his kingdom, that which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion shall be even unto the end.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in him and in earth, which
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   deliver Daniel from the power of the lion. This is why we must worship him, says the
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   king. This is the God, the living God, not like our dumb idols, but the God who acts,
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   the God who does things, delivers, sets free. And if Daniel could say that and this king
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   could say that before the coming of Christ, how much more so should we be able to say
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   this? We look back at Jesus Christ, Son of God, crucified, dead, buried, the end, no,
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   no, the resurrection. The God who delivers, the God who conquers all his enemies, the
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   God who can set us free, who worketh signs and wonders, the God who can never be frustrated
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   and whose purposes are ever sure. Well, my dear friends, that seems to me to be the message
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   and the lesson of this great story in the sixth chapter of the book of the prophet Daniel.
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   Daniel believed in his God. Do we really believe in him? Do we know he is the living God, unchangeable,
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   steadfast, forever, the almighty God, the God who can do the impossible, the God of
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   God? If we are to impress others, well, we should so know this God and have such confidence
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   in him that it makes of us men and women like this man Daniel, faithful spirit, loyal, steadfast,
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   indomitably the best people in society, whatever our position, whatever our work may chance
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   to be. That's our calling. That is our opportunity. At such a time as this, may God make us equal
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   to the opportunity. Let us pray.
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   O Lord, our God, we come to thee and we thank thee, O Lord, that in spite of all our unworthiness,
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   we know that thou art God and that beside thee there is none other. Lord, give us this
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:21.000]   spirit which will enable us to dare to be like Daniel. O Lord, make us outstanding
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:26.000]   men and women. Make of us such people that all who work with us and who know us will
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   be amazed at us and will come and ask us the secret of our behavior and our whole department.
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   Lord, make us equal to this day of crisis. Grant that many through seeing us and knowing
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   us will be led to thee, the only true and living God, and worship thee and thy dear
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:55.000]   son through thy most blessed Holy Spirit. Lord, continue to use thy faithful people
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   here to that great and glorious end. We ask it in Christ's name. Amen.
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   And now unto him who is able to keep us from falling and to present us faultless before
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   the presence of his glory with exceeding joy, to the only wise God, our Savior, be glory
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   and majesty, dominion and power both now and forever. Amen.
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:36.000]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
