[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280]   Clear skies, I can finally see Jupiter!
[00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:11.920]   Here's an awesome report titled "The Sky is in Our Grasp" by Irish Taker which
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.680]   aims to help photographers and videographers to get the best picture they can
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.440]   regardless of the weather conditions outside by providing a way to change the sky after the fact,
[00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:27.120]   like here taking a sunny day and replacing it with a thunderstorm, or like literally taking
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:32.800]   an alien ship from the movie District 9 and pasting that into the skies, or like adding
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:39.920]   a floating castle like here or super moons in our videos. So there's a lot of really interesting
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.160]   stuff that can happen here. In this video we'll learn about the proposed technique
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.600]   and try out the Google Colab notebook which lets us actually change the sky in our own videos,
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.920]   as well as learn about using weights and biases artifacts for reversing the data
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.360]   and then using WNV for tracking our many awesome sky augmentation experiments.
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.960]   I'm Ivan from Weights and Biases and let's get started!
[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.760]   The proposed method comes from a paper by Zhengxia Zhou and talks about using a sky
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:14.000]   matting network to isolate the sky where then the 360 degrees background images of our choice
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.200]   will be pasted, whether we're talking you know the cloudy skies images or the ones with like
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.120]   alien ships or floating castles, and then using optical flow to track where the pixels in the
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.760]   video are moving such that our sky would then follow accordingly with the rest of the video.
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:35.440]   Now let's try out the technique on Google Colab. This notebook utilizes Weights and Biases machine
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.880]   learning tools in some really cool ways. WNV helps you save and debug your models by
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.640]   tracking predictions, metadata, and versioning your models and datasets as artifacts,
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.360]   then allowing you to then compare all of that info in a single dashboard.
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.040]   You know we'll be using that to like try different sky augmentation techniques and
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.320]   then being able to compare and see like what we like what we don't like.
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.640]   So to log into the WNV account all I have to do is to click on this link here and copy the API key.
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.560]   If you don't have a WNV account you can you know quickly create one and the process will be the
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.800]   same, but for me you know I just copy this link and paste it here and press enter and I am logged
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.080]   in. I also love the way that Aarush has formatted this notebook in a way that now we're not actually
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.440]   seeing any code unless we double click on the cells and then the actual code shows up.
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.200]   Like in this cell we will first create a new project called SkyAR in our WNV accounts and
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:39.120]   then use artifacts to download the SkyMining network from the same project that the report
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.480]   is from. Weights and Biases artifacts let you upload your files to the cloud and then automatically
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.920]   version them which is really useful when keeping track of many versions of your models and data
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.200]   sets. In this video we'll use artifacts to keep track of our output videos with augmented skies.
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.680]   As well there's also a cool feature with artifacts where they show you the graph view
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.720]   that lets you map where which files came from so it's so they're they're really cool you know.
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:12.720]   So upon running the cell we can now see the new SkyAR project appear in our WNV accounts and
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.480]   you know we can get to the project either by clicking the link here or we can also get there
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.760]   by clicking the project page link here. And it'll also you know as I was saying start that new run
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:28.320]   that has the artifact that we've downloaded you know with the SkyMining network here. So in the
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.200]   project page we have our runs which are like you know instances of running our models or running
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.720]   some sort of predictions and in the project page we can compare them side by side but also we can
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.840]   click on you know each run individually and then you know see the info for that particular run that
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:50.800]   we got. Now here we can define a few helper functions and get to the fun stuff which is
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:57.120]   if this parameter here is set to true we can actually upload our own videos to play with.
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:03.760]   So I have a nice video prepped here so let's use that one. After this video has finished uploading
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:09.600]   we get to choose our sky template like what will be pasted as our new found sky and as you can see
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:16.240]   we have here like quite a few exotic choices like the you know far off planets or alien ships or
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:21.920]   floating castles or you know if we actually open this drop-down menu we have like a few more
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:28.320]   traditional choices like a thunderstorm or you know cloudy skies. Let's actually try going with
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.680]   the cloudy skies I've not yet tried that one. So after choosing the template you know we can run
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:39.120]   this cell and we're good to go. Here are some additional configurations that are you know that
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:45.200]   we can play with. I'll go with the defaults provided by the author of the paper here and
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:51.840]   next I'll pretty much start processing our video. So now we can actually begin to visualize our
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:59.360]   sky augmented videos by running this cell of code here. So now we can navigate to our project page
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:06.320]   and see a new run appearing here. These runs are like named randomly each time we initialize
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.280]   a new instance right so this one is warm star but you know just a way to kind of
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:18.480]   keep track of them. So if I now click on this specific run we can see the difference right here
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.560]   and so you may kind of be asking yourself you know like this GIF previews are nice you know
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:28.720]   they they pretty much like the first 40 frames for us to kind of get a snapshot and to get the feel
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:34.240]   for whether you know the augmentations working or not you know whether we like what we see etc.
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:41.680]   How do we actually get the real video? So the videos here are logged you know they're called
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:49.200]   here as the demo.avi and the demo.cat.avi files and we're actually logging them here using you
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:56.000]   know just these four lines of code as artifacts and so now if we go to our runs page with artifacts
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.720]   we can see that there's like a new artifacts appearing here and if we go to files we can
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:08.000]   see that now here are two .avi, two video files. So let's you know download the demo.avi file and
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:14.880]   see how it looks. So like that's actually the full you know augmented video here.
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:23.600]   Does a really good job with the cloudy skies I think you know and the demo.cat one it's
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:27.760]   essentially like demo.avi but it's this little split screen which lets us compare kind of side
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:35.920]   to side the before and after of changing the sky. So you can see here you know kind of how it how
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:42.560]   it you know used to be and how what what it was you know augmented into. So now let me perform a
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:48.560]   few more runs and try out you know a few more of those you know skyline templates and we'll talk
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:53.920]   more about the dashboard functionality and the artifacts and kind of see some more cool results.
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:22.080]   So we started off with the run featuring you know the cloudy skies. However I then went ahead and I
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:27.520]   performed two more runs and we can see them in my project. So the first run is the empty run
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:32.240]   which just downloaded the artifacts. Now the next runs you know this one was the cloudy skies.
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:39.920]   This one that I did with the district 9 alien ship which is you know it looks it looks real
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:44.400]   cool in my opinion right like who doesn't want like an alien ship floating just in the skies
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:52.400]   randomly right you know that sort of thing. And also I tried the template the sunset template
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:59.600]   here. So remember the cool thing that I was saying about artifacts you know we're essentially
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:05.680]   logging like to the point of how do we get the actual videos of our with the augmented skies.
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:12.640]   We're here we're logging the demo cat and demo cat and demo.avi files as the artifact with the
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:19.440]   type output video and type video. So if I now go to the artifacts tab for the project I can see
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:24.560]   all of the versions of our artifacts for all the three videos that we've logged. So remember
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:30.720]   you know the first artifact you know it was the cloudy skies then the second one that I've logged
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:37.840]   it's the alien ship and the third one is the sunset template sky. So the cool thing about
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:42.640]   artifacts is that you know even though we're logging the files that are with the same names
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:47.680]   no they're all like demo.avi files. Artifacts understand that the contents of the files are
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:54.560]   different and logs them as different versions of the of the artifact right. And so for instance
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:09:00.800]   now if I go here and I download this demo.avi file we can check out the actual video with the
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:10.000]   district 9 ship. Let's check it out and there it is floating around just you know over the horizon.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:16.960]   Yeah I mean it's a little bit choppy but I think it kind of does the job for an alien ship right.
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:24.480]   Another cool thing here is that if we go to a specific runs page and we click for instance
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:30.480]   here the sunset template and we'll click on the artifacts tab here and you know we'll be able to
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:37.920]   see the artifacts for this specific run. And so if we now download this file you know we'll see the
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:43.600]   augmented sky with the sunset template which actually looks real nice you know this kind of
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:50.800]   nice sunsetty sky right here. I also like the kind of color little subtle color correction
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:55.520]   that's happening around here it's also you know really brings out that sunset feel here.
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:01.520]   But yeah it's kind of pretty cool we're logging the files with the same names as artifacts and
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:07.520]   we can you know really distinguish between them between the different versions of those
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:12.160]   files which is really really cool. So I decided to do a few more tests and try this approach
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:16.320]   with a few videos that I found in my phone. So this is the result that I got.
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:16.560]   you
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:17.360]   you
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:17.860]   you
[00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:18.360]   you
[00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:19.160]   you
[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:19.660]   you
[00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:20.160]   you
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:20.660]   you
[00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:21.160]   you
[00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:21.660]   you
[00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:22.160]   you
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.220]   you
[00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:26.280]   you
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.340]   you
[00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:30.400]   you
[00:10:56.540 --> 00:11:00.860]   so it's a really fun technique to play with and I wish his report goes into
[00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:04.300]   some great detail into how like everything actually works behind the
[00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:08.660]   scenes so highly recommend that you read his report or you can also try it out
[00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:12.060]   yourself on Google call up links for all that good stuff will be in the
