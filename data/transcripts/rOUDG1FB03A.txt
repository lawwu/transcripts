[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920]   freeberg punchy now. punchy office a punch drug salty
[00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.560]   freeberg reminds me of a story for this weekend. Okay, we're
[00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.360]   waiting in line to go to the encore beach club to see Kygo.
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.360]   And I go me and freeberg are at the back of the line. Everybody
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.120]   else has gotten through all you guys are filtering into the
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:22.960]   booth. I go was tight. And he said, So I put up my phone.
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.600]   That's all I have my key card. He takes out a phone his key
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:32.160]   card, a small bag of the salt and vicar salted pistachios. Oh,
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.740]   he travels. He will leave home without his little bag of
[00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.560]   pistachios. And they're like, no food in the guy says no food in
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.840]   the club. Now and he goes, What do you mean no food? This is in
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.160]   a bag. It's like it's just pistachios. Just pistachios. They
[00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.260]   get in an argument back and forth back and forth. He's like,
[00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.880]   I'm gonna take a stand. This is outrageous. I said freeberg
[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.400]   Come on, let's just go. So we go inside. This is where he takes
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.760]   a stand. And then he's like, Can you believe it? They took my
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.840]   fucking pistachios like these are my pistachios. Tilted easily.
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.880]   And then and then on the way out. He's like, if I see that
[00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:10.560]   guy, this is a fucking curb your enthusiasm skit right here.
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.440]   Where's my pistachios? salty pistachios. I was walking through
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.360]   the casino later eating the pistachios. I fell in love with
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.960]   freeberg this weekend. I had so much fun with this fucking Oh,
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.960]   my god. He's so he was he was living his best life in the
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.360]   clinic. Show the bigger picture. Nick just zoom out so you can
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.720]   see Oh, there I am. Yeah, right next to him. There's me look at
[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.640]   how huge my ass looks. God. That's a lot of that's a lot of
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.920]   s. That is a show that look at that huge dumper. Wow. That's
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.840]   incredible. And what's going on with those? Those underwear?
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.360]   Who's good is that Jekyll's? That's my dad. But I think it's
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.640]   just the t shirt. I think it's just the t shirt. You obviously
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.600]   stopped the Ozempic sideways. I'm still sideways. 175 right
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.760]   back on to you. Nope, no, you stopped the Ozempic and it came
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.000]   right back. Vegas was so fun. I gotta say I gotta shout out to
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.440]   those guys that run that Delilah joint. I think that's like the
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.280]   best new restaurant. It's a really great place. A little
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.840]   loud. I wish we just go like one notch lower on the volume for
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.160]   the world. Good scene. Once you hit 50 all the clubs are
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.920]   too. Rain Man David
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:31.440]   with us again on the all in podcast the architect himself.
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.400]   Crazy hair doesn't care. David Sachs. Friedberg is committing
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.240]   suicide in the bottom of a pool. Apparently he just cannot take
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.520]   all the adulation and inside. That's a leaving Las Vegas
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.240]   scene. Exactly. That's you leaving Vegas down 150 dimes,
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.720]   which you could have given to DeSantis like Sachs did. And hot
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:59.080]   off of his wonderful weekend. The afterglow of Vegas. Chamath
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.880]   Polly. We went to Vegas to play cards. It was a wonderful
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.600]   weekend. We had a great time. Everybody bonded. A lot of laughs
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.960]   were had wonderful time. Wonderful, wonderful time. I got
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.240]   into craps. I was never a craps guy. But I had a great was Jay
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.760]   Callen craps. Oh my god. I got 40 I had a 40 die roll run. It
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.200]   was incredible. There's something about that game that
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.520]   is like super addicting to me. Oh, when you just go on a 40 die
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:32.120]   roll. I think craps really is one of the best gambling games
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.320]   ever created. So exciting. It's so exciting. It's so exciting.
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.440]   It's like hitting the hard ways. And then the feature bets feature
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.320]   bets. Features are such leaky bets. No, but when they hit
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.800]   they're just so far when they hit they just all the dopamine
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.200]   gets released loved it. I spiked aces for the max bet. It was
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.320]   like, Oh, I saw that you put 500 on it. Yeah, they only let me
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.160]   bet 500 but I bet 31 to one on aces hit it.
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:02.200]   Table went crazy when that 15 dimes were pushed. Speaking
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.040]   about pushing 150 dimes, Sachs you've been getting a lot of
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.000]   press for being the architect. I saw some stories. Let me ask you
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   a question. Total fake news. All fake news. We know that
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.360]   everybody's emailing me to try to get answers about you. I just
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.880]   see see you on this but the press has been trying to cover
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.960]   your role architecting the Ron DeSantis presidential. We talked
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:25.120]   about last week. What's the color? Well, the press wants to
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.920]   know what 150 dime skis is. They can look it up in the Urban
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.360]   Dictionary. I think that would be easier. Let me ask you a
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.160]   question about your giving strategy or your donation
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:41.480]   strategy. I noticed that you're donating to RFK for president
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.880]   and you're donating to Ron DeSantis. Are you donating to
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.240]   any other president? And why are you betting both sides of the
[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.360]   aisle? This is confusing to me. How about you want to one side
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.000]   to win? I mean, I've already explained this on previous pods.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.400]   I don't know the answer. What's the
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.920]   the simplest way to understand my political giving is just to
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.960]   watch the all in pod. And I always end up describing who I'm
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.320]   supporting, and why and which causes on the pod first. And
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.000]   then I back it up, I put my money where my mouth is. So
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.160]   there's no mystery. There's no like backroom deals going on.
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.160]   It's just me writing checks and support of things I've almost
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.760]   always really talked about on the pod.
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:23.760]   Okay, so what about this question of betting both sides?
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.560]   So you're betting for both teams in a basketball series? Like, I
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:29.600]   don't know, I don't understand that.
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.280]   Well, I've said that it's not competitive. At this point, I've
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.360]   said that I would support RFK Jr. For the Democratic Party
[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.200]   nomination, and I support the Sanchez on the Republican side.
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.800]   There's no contradiction, I guess, if they both made it to
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.960]   the general, then I'd have a real dilemma. But let's face it,
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.920]   they're both underdogs in their lane. Okay, it'd be a high class
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.200]   problem to have if it ended up being a DeSantis Kennedy race
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.560]   instead of a Biden Trump repeat.
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.680]   Well, I mean, I've played blackjack with you, you do play
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.360]   multiple hands at once. So I guess this does. This does
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.360]   track. It's not enough action for you to just play one hand.
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.680]   I don't really see a contradiction there. Right now.
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:12.280]   There's a Trump DeSantis race going on. And there's a Biden
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.960]   Kennedy race going on. Okay, now you hold a lot of fundraisers.
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:20.440]   tomas and I are actually doing an event for Bobby Kennedy. Soon
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.760]   in the next two weeks. Got it. Let's go to you tomorrow.
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:28.000]   Well, I think it's important to just acknowledge an uncomfortable
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.040]   truth. And I come at it from a person who's independent. I'm
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.560]   not registered Democrat or Republican, but I've donated
[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.080]   millions of dollars to the Democrats in the last couple of
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:46.880]   cycles. But I'm concerned about Joe Biden's mental acuity. And
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:55.600]   recently, when you look at how the White House behaves, the
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.200]   thing that I'm worried about is that there's almost like this
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.040]   sensation that there's a shadow government that's actually
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:04.920]   running the country. And we didn't elect any of those
[00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:08.680]   people. And this is nothing to say anything bad about Janet
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:13.320]   Yellen, or Jeff Zients, or anybody else. But I think it's
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:16.760]   very important to acknowledge that, you know, other presidents
[00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:21.280]   have typically seen turnover in the highest ranks of government
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:26.200]   every two years or so. And there's been incredible
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.680]   consistency. Now, one could say, well, that's a good thing. The
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.680]   other side of it is, well, that's what allows more
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.160]   vibrancy in government and to make sure that the President
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:40.200]   remains always in charge. And so I think it's very important in
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:43.440]   this moment, where we have a president who's 82 odd years
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:48.480]   older, however old he is. We need to have a chance the
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:52.040]   American public to re underwrite his mental acuity. And I think
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:55.240]   that's a judgment that we should all be allowed to make. And I
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:59.720]   think the fairest way to do that is to feel the candidate who can
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:03.360]   be on the debate stage with him, and who can actually just go toe
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:07.000]   to toe on the critical issues so that we as an American electorate
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.560]   can decide for ourselves, where does this issue land? Is he
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:15.760]   mentally super sharp and ready to go for another four years, in
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:19.320]   which case a lot of folks will support him? Or is this a moment
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.640]   where we actually need to be very responsible at the future
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:24.600]   of the country and not create some puppet government
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:28.320]   situation? I don't think it's funny that we have this weekend
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:31.360]   at Bernie's like mean that goes around about him. This is the
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.400]   President of the United States is the most important person in
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:38.120]   the world. We can't be in a situation where like, that is a
[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:44.360]   30% probability that people joke about. So my support of Bobby
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:47.080]   Kennedy is in part because what I've heard from him, I find
[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:50.880]   intriguing. But the more important thing is, somebody
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:57.400]   needs to be in the arena on the democratic side, and put to test
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:01.000]   this mental acuity construct here and get us to an answer.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.080]   Because otherwise, I am worried that there's a bunch of folks
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:08.000]   that were not elected, who are actually running the government
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.400]   and I'm not sure how much Biden actually knows or doesn't know.
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:11.960]   And I want to know the answer to that question.
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.000]   I think everybody wants to know the answer and feels like
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.560]   Democrats would like a different candidate. That's what the
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:21.200]   polling is showing to be, you know, put on the field here. And
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.800]   there is the issue of he's had the fewest number of news
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:26.720]   conferences, we don't get to hear from him directly, which
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:32.680]   then fuels I think, this perception Friedberg, that he's
[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:35.920]   in cognitive decline, and perhaps the cognitive decline
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:40.720]   has increased. Republicans love to, and the right love to, you
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:44.640]   know, make these images of him confused on stage, who knows if
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:48.000]   he's actually confused, or if those are being selectively
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.720]   edited. But it certainly doesn't look good. When you don't put
[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:55.200]   the person out there to face the music. And to take hard
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:58.960]   questions. I can't imagine he would do very well in a town
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:03.200]   hall or in an extended number of debates. And so this is the
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:06.440]   thing that I find truly scary is, if the guy can't make it
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:09.320]   through the debates, and he can't debate RFK and 10 other
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:13.680]   people, and he can't do news conferences, and we haven't
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:17.240]   heard directly from him or had him like face some really hard
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:20.600]   questioning. He had he did one thing on MSNBC or CNN, and it
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:25.240]   was so pathetically sycophantic. And it looked like it was highly
[00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:28.480]   edited. I kind of like that the host who did it up, pull up her
[00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:30.800]   name in a minute. I forgot her name right now. She's actually
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.960]   pretty good. She's kind of funny. And she's kind of
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:35.160]   insightful, but she just so through softball to softball. Is
[00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:38.640]   there an age, Sultan of science that we should have a cognitive
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:41.520]   test for? For office in your mind?
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:44.320]   I don't have an opinion on that.
[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:48.000]   You don't? On an age? I mean,
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.440]   yeah, like, should we or should we have a cognitive test?
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:53.880]   A cognitive test? We cognitively test the President
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:55.720]   of the United States for office. Like, there's also
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:58.240]   a thing which I'm often saying is that when you hold debates,
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.800]   and you do town halls, and you do rallies, then that is a
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:04.800]   cognitive test. You'll see, you'll be able to take the
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:08.040]   cognitive measure by seeing how quick on their feet they are.
[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:13.080]   But if Biden doesn't debate anybody, we won't see it. And
[00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:16.240]   right now, they're saying they won't debate Kennedy. So that
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.720]   tells you right there that they're afraid of something.
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:22.200]   I just want to reiterate this. This is the single most
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:26.240]   important person in the world, in the single most important
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:32.840]   job. If it breaks your brain in a moment like this, to not be
[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:35.720]   partisan and think what would you do if it was the other side?
[00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:40.960]   I just think you're like an unpatriotic rube. And you're
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.760]   gonna get tricked. I'm not saying you Jason, I'm saying
[00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:45.440]   anybody that thinks that I'm in your camp, I want to see him
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:46.040]   debate. Yeah,
[00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:48.680]   especially if the Ukraine war is still going on, because we're
[00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:51.800]   that close to being in a direct shooting war with Russia, which
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:55.640]   could lead to a nuclear war. So you need somebody to be
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:58.160]   contained, I'll be more worried about the relationship is
[00:11:58.160 --> 00:11:59.840]   contained. I think it's escalated. I don't think it's
[00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:02.680]   contained, it's escalating. And as of yesterday, there seems to
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:06.160]   be some conflagration between Kosovo and Serbia that's kicking
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.640]   up. So all of a sudden, we're talking about a totally
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:13.480]   different European land war. And we have fiscal instability.
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:16.760]   We're about to talk about it today. But the home market could
[00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:19.840]   implode in the United States, the commercial real estate
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:24.640]   market has already imploded. There's all this complexity. And
[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:29.200]   I think that the idea that you can't demand the most important
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:33.280]   person in the world to be on top of their game, I just think that
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:37.040]   that's outrageous. You expect the best player in the NBA to be
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:40.400]   elite, right? Yes, of course. Yes, they have to get good
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:43.120]   sleep. They have to have good fitness. They're measuring every
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:46.360]   single dimension of an NBA players life. They measure their
[00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:49.280]   sleep now their diet, their shooting percentages,
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:52.320]   everything. And we're not doing that for the president states,
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:55.720]   by the way, the MSNBC host who got the one interview I've seen
[00:12:55.720 --> 00:13:00.800]   with Biden in years was Stephanie rule. Are you HLE from
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:01.800]   11th hour?
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:04.320]   Well, they give them the questions. That's how she gets
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:06.840]   the interview. Have you seen that like Biden has these cute
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.640]   cards when he goes with the podium, and literally it's got
[00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:12.320]   the questions and it says who to call on. So they script the
[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:14.200]   whole thing. That's a stack. That's a stack deck.
[00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:15.920]   But Trump did that as well. If you remember,
[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.840]   in fairness,
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:19.600]   nobody gave him the questions.
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:27.760]   He said a PR the McEnany lady. She had a huge binder and she
[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:30.160]   would flip to the talk. My point is that's okay.
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:32.200]   We never did the same thing with the stance. What are you talking
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:32.560]   about?
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:35.000]   Didn't you pick the first five speakers? First five questions
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.800]   were people you knew. You said that he didn't stack the deck.
[00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:38.800]   Jason, come on, stop.
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:40.680]   We didn't have a script.
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:42.840]   You pick the first five speakers. My point is not a
[00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:45.600]   press conference. That's an introductory event. That's
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:46.360]   someone announcing
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:48.200]   Okay, fine. Whatever. Same thing. You're
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:51.760]   no, it's not. No, no, no, we're talking about a White House
[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:56.200]   press conference. And he goes up to the podium. And secretly
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:00.280]   when they zoom in on the camera, they're seeing that literally he
[00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:02.880]   knows who to call on and what the question is going to be. So
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:06.720]   in other words, the media is cooperating with the Biden
[00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:07.520]   administration
[00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:08.360]   for access,
[00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:11.280]   for access, and they're giving him the questions.
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:13.680]   All right, anyway, let's let's move on. I think it's very
[00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:15.160]   important to just acknowledge that you're
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.000]   trying to normalize it by comparing it to
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.960]   completely different kind of event. I am saying that is
[00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:22.080]   something I never did that with Trump. They never give Trump the
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:25.480]   questions. He loves to mix it up. I mean, that's winning.
[00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:28.120]   That's how you know he's still mentally fit. I mean, a mentally
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:30.760]   unfit Trump would be a scary proposition. You may or may not
[00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:33.320]   like his personality or temperament, but no one is
[00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:36.440]   accusing him of being not. No, he's sharp or having dementia.
[00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:38.800]   I think it's important to get on the record. I don't think we are
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:43.080]   saying that he is unfit to be president. I think at least what
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:47.400]   I'm saying is, we have a right to underwrite the president
[00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:52.720]   every four years. And on this dimension, this is the biggest
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:58.960]   issue that I see with Biden. And I'm concerned in the lack of
[00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:04.640]   turnover in the White House. And I want to know that he is
[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:09.000]   actually in charge day to day and making the decisions versus a
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.400]   shadow government. That's all I want to know. And I want to see
[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:19.040]   him live on the debate stage. So that he can validate. Yeah, he
[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:22.520]   is firmly on the controls. 100% of Americans want this. The only
[00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:25.840]   people who don't want it is people who are in power, who are
[00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:26.800]   part of his group.
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:28.840]   That's not 100%.
[00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:32.480]   There's a I'm talking about America's who vote. They all
[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.400]   want to see him debate is I don't think I don't know
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:37.560]   anybody who doesn't want to see a vibrant debate. So I think
[00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:41.920]   this is something the Democratic Party needs to the Democratic
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:44.240]   Party needs to rethink their stance on this, put them out
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:47.400]   there, put them on the field, up or down, left or right, he has
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:51.320]   to debate at least three, four debates in the primaries, you
[00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:52.200]   know, earn a slot.
[00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:56.120]   It'll do real damage to the Democrats if Bobby Kennedy gets
[00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:59.320]   a ton of steam. And they ignore him. I'll give you a different
[00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:01.800]   example of how Bobby's being roadblocked, which is when you
[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:05.440]   go to 538.com. And you look at you know, Nate does a great job
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:08.800]   of pulling up all of the polling that happens from all of the
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:13.600]   polling agencies. There are many instances where the democratic
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:18.360]   fields won't even include him when they ask him questions. And
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:21.200]   so there is definitely a concerted effort here. And I
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:24.280]   think it's not that I don't want Joe Biden to win. I think he's,
[00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:28.800]   he could be fantastic. Again, I voted for him. And I think that
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:31.320]   if he's mentally sharp, and his hands are on one of the chances,
[00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:35.120]   you think he's sharp, Chama? No, I'm saying, I don't know. I
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:37.600]   know. I want to know for myself, what do you think the chances
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:40.280]   are? I don't mean just using logic here. I think they could
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:42.720]   be pretty good, actually, you know, there's a lot of like, if
[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:46.080]   you look at Buffett, he's 92. He's sharp as attack mongers 96.
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:48.360]   He's sharp as attack. I think that if you live reasonably
[00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:51.520]   well, and Biden's got some great things working for him, he's
[00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:54.440]   he's been a T total of his whole life. So all the things that
[00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:58.000]   would have caught up with you in your 80s Biden has avoided. So
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.280]   from a health perspective, he has the best chance of being on
[00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:03.320]   top of his game. Can he be physically frail? I don't care
[00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:07.760]   about that. You know, that happens to everybody. So I think
[00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:11.840]   it's important to disambiguate those two. And so it is very
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:15.120]   easy to tell when you're standing on a debate stage, hell,
[00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:19.000]   you can sit on the debate stage, I don't care. But I want you to
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.920]   be able to explain what you think, in a way that's cogent
[00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:27.000]   and coherent. And you walk away thinking, I feel safer with him
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.240]   with his hands on the controls here.
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:31.040]   Saks, what do you think? Is he? What do you think the chances
[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:34.600]   are? He's sharp as a tack? He's not in cognitive decline?
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:40.600]   He's not. We know that. The question is whether he can serve
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:41.280]   at all.
[00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:43.440]   Should people have to take a cognitive test? You think that
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:44.320]   would be a good improvement?
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:46.160]   Look, I think the debates the cognitive test,
[00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:49.080]   but the Senate and stuff like that, because it does seem like
[00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:49.600]   people are
[00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:52.840]   the voters are the cognitive test. Okay, the problem is when
[00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:57.080]   the media is cooperating with the candidate by not asking them
[00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:59.560]   tough questions, or even we're sharing the questions with them
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:02.960]   to give voters a false impression of how strong they
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:06.120]   are. I mean, look, the media's job is to be fundamentally
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:09.240]   antagonistic with the people in power not to cooperate with
[00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:09.480]   them.
[00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:12.080]   Here's something super intriguing that happened this
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:17.080]   week. Jamie Dimon has hinted at running for office. Bill Ackman
[00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:21.240]   made a case for him to run for president in 2024. This is
[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:23.400]   getting a lot of steam all of a sudden people are talking about
[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:28.040]   it on CNBC. And it's trending on Twitter. On Wednesday, JP Morgan
[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:31.040]   Chase CEO Jamie Dimon made some comments about potentially
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:34.680]   running for office in the future quote, I love my country. And
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:37.800]   maybe one day I'll serve my country in one capacity or
[00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:42.400]   another. He's 67 years old. He didn't know that Bill Ackman
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:46.240]   tweeted his support for diamond running as a dam against Biden.
[00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:50.560]   Ackman put out a number of compelling points. Diamond is
[00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:52.280]   one of the world's most respected business leaders.
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:55.440]   That's true. politically centrist pro business pro free
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:58.560]   enterprise all true, supportive of well designed social programs
[00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:01.120]   and rational tax policies that can help the less fortunate,
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:03.800]   smart, thoughtful, pragmatic knows how to bring opposing
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:06.560]   parties together highly respected by right left and
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:10.400]   center. I think that's also true. superbly managed JP Morgan
[00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:14.840]   through every crisis, quote, no bullshit straight talking
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:18.360]   charismatic leader with an enormous grasp of the world's
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:20.560]   issues, and how to address them.
[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:24.440]   Tomorrow, I'll just ask it to you plainly. If you had three
[00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:30.800]   choices, or four choices, Trump, to Santas, Biden, and the Jedi,
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:34.320]   Jamie Dimon stack rank those for us rank them. Who do you got?
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:37.160]   Who do you vote for? Those are your four choices?
[00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:47.320]   Probably Jamie Dimon one. Okay. Santa's too. Okay. And Trump and
[00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:51.120]   Biden. It's a bit of a tie. Bit of a tie. Garbage, garbage. Okay.
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:53.840]   Not garbage, garbage. Don't Don't say that. But okay, it's a
[00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:57.040]   bit of a time. I mean, it's two people that nobody wants to vote
[00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:00.880]   for, it seems wants to run. I personally believe that the era
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:04.400]   of septuagenarians and octogenarians should come to an
[00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:08.120]   end in terms of their ability to run this country. I want that
[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:12.600]   transition. Now, Jamie is 67. So but he's still much younger than
[00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:15.480]   these two other guys. And again, I go back to yours is a lot.
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:21.200]   It's a lot and vitality, energy. This matters. And I think that
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:27.400]   he is a very competent, economic, rational actor. So it
[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:30.440]   would be interesting to see. I mean, look, the reality is, if I
[00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:32.560]   had to be really honest with you, I think that what we should
[00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:36.640]   do is keep chipping away at the establishment and how they pick
[00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:41.280]   candidates, it's going to be a slow process. But I think in 10
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:44.200]   or 15 years, the real thing that we should all do is if there's
[00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:47.680]   enough citizen journalism, that we should really just change the
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:52.600]   Constitution, so that we can allow people that have been here
[00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:55.320]   for 25 plus years that have paid all their taxes that have
[00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:59.200]   followed all the rules to run for president. And then we could
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:02.040]   actually just we could vote Elon in and just have him clean it up
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:05.760]   the way he's cleaning up everything else. Honestly, why
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:08.920]   not just do that? I mean, who would who would not want that?
[00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:12.200]   sacks, let me ask you to stack rank and then we'll get to the
[00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:16.440]   change in the Constitution issue, which is that is a hell
[00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:16.760]   Mary.
[00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:18.960]   How would you rank those four?
[00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:24.560]   I think that we have run out of topics to talk about if Bill
[00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:28.560]   Ackman's latest political brain fart is a major topic of
[00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:29.320]   conversation.
[00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:34.360]   I think this is inspiring. You guys put Trump in office, the GOP
[00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:37.480]   put Trump in office, he's the outsider is outsider lunatic.
[00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:41.880]   And you can't even consider Jamie Lemon, you're laughing at
[00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:44.280]   that. And you put Trump in office, you guys put Trump in
[00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:46.120]   office, and you're gonna do it again.
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:50.080]   You mean you guys listen to GOP? Okay, look, party. Here's the
[00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:52.400]   part about this conversation that sort of makes sense. Two
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:55.840]   thirds of the country says that they are uninspired and in fact
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:59.160]   fatigued by the idea of having a repeat of the same choice that
[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:02.520]   four years ago, everybody wants a different choice. So I get
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:07.360]   this like fantasy basketball drafting thing that we're trying
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:12.000]   to do here. Okay. The reason why I call it a brain fart. And I
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.920]   look, Bill's a really smart guy. I'm not dragging him. But in
[00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:17.760]   order to win the presidency, you have to get the nomination of a
[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:20.520]   major party. And the problem with all this like fantasy
[00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:24.400]   drafting is that you're trying to draft people who are anathema
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:28.280]   to the party that you're trying to get them the nomination from.
[00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:33.360]   And Trump was able to get the nomination, the Republican
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:35.760]   Party, Jamie Dimon would have to get the nomination, the
[00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:37.960]   Democratic Party, that's not going to happen. And it does
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:40.560]   remind me of Bloomberg. Remember, Bloomberg spent $100
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:42.760]   million on his campaign in late Yeah.
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:46.040]   In a way, he spent a lot of money, and he made it to the
[00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:48.400]   first question of the first debate. Remember what happened?
[00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:53.600]   Elizabeth Warren said that this is a billionaire who talks about
[00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:56.960]   he didn't fight, he laid down, he rolled over, she like ended
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:01.000]   him with one question, one debate. So my point is that you
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.160]   got to be able to get the nomination of a major party. And
[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:06.200]   actually, I think neither party could nominate a banker right
[00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:09.440]   now. I mean, if you saw what happened around the whole
[00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:13.840]   banking crisis, that I think still going on in slow motion. I
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:17.800]   mean, the amount of animosity both towards the banks that went
[00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:21.760]   under, and the idea of, you know, potentially bailing them
[00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:25.200]   out, and then also the animosity towards JP Morgan, when it
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:30.520]   actually bought First Republic. I mean, both parties have such a
[00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:33.520]   strong populist wing in them right now that I think you could
[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:37.840]   never get. Yeah, the head of the number one bank in the US to be
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:40.440]   their candidate. You're completely wrong. I think in
[00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:44.020]   this case, respectfully, I mean, he could run as an independent
[00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:49.100]   as well. And although you know, you like to think or it seems
[00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:51.500]   like you're proposing that things are going to be as they
[00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:54.600]   always were, Trump shows a wild card and then people forget Ross
[00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:59.800]   Perot, you know, he got 19% of the popular vote, he hit 20
[00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:04.680]   million votes to Bush's 40 million, and Clinton's 44. It is
[00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:07.520]   not unprecedented. And we are in a really struggling time.
[00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:10.360]   You started this off by saying that Democrats should draft Jamie
[00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:11.160]   diamond. Now you're saying
[00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:12.240]   I'm fine.
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:15.760]   I don't know what he was independent. There's no
[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:21.720]   movement to draft the top banker in the country. Like, where do
[00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:24.840]   you see this reality star like Trump in? Okay, that was the
[00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:28.200]   wildcard of all wildcards. He ran, he ran in one of the two
[00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:31.280]   major parties and he hit a nerve. I know that's my point.
[00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:34.740]   So now tell me about Ross Perot. Tell me about Ross Perot. And
[00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:37.360]   how did he hit 20 million votes? And isn't the world much
[00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:39.720]   different right now because of media because of people going
[00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:42.880]   direct? We're talking I mean, Chamath just proposed Elon. If
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:43.920]   you're proposing Elon,
[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:47.600]   I'm proposing a constitutional amendment so that competent
[00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:51.760]   people, sure, who are not in the country. Now, if you've lived
[00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:55.160]   here for 25 years, or 30 years, you've created hundreds of
[00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:58.160]   thousands of jobs and paid 10s of billions of taxes. The idea
[00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:02.680]   that you are less fit than half these politicians to run for
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:03.960]   president is insane.
[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:05.640]   Okay, that well, that's a different question. What do you
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:08.880]   think about that? Do you think we should change the Constitution
[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:11.840]   allow non nationals to run for president?
[00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:14.840]   Not don't stop saying non nationals. It's gross. It's
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:17.560]   like, well, you know, it's people that weren't necessarily
[00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:19.760]   born here. But if you've lived your whole life, you're the
[00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:22.840]   majority of your life and you've built value for America and
[00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:25.920]   helped it when all of a sudden, you're less capable of being
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:29.120]   president. That's absolutely not true. Oh, I didn't say it was
[00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:31.200]   I'm describing what the Constitution is.
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:34.440]   Somebody who's not born called the Schwarzenegger amendment
[00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:37.000]   because you know, when he was governor of California, there
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.360]   were people who wanted him to run for president. But look,
[00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:42.000]   it's too hard to change the Constitution. That's a very
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.760]   difficult process. So do I think that's going to happen? No.
[00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:49.200]   Would you be in favor of that? And under what circumstances do
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:51.640]   you think that it's about saying we should change that? He's
[00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:53.760]   emphatic, we should change it in fact. So what do you think?
[00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:56.520]   It's not a pressing issue for me. I'd rather have a balanced
[00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:59.280]   budget amendment. I'd rather the president have a line item veto
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:01.200]   to control spending
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:04.520]   if you want to blow up the government and cut it down to
[00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:08.960]   size and impose the ideals of liberalism, true liberalism,
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:12.800]   free speech, well controlled borders, but good immigration,
[00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:17.840]   etc, etc. I feel like there are lots of people who could do
[00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:23.840]   that. And the only difference is, they were accidentally not
[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:26.880]   born here, except they've created more value in America
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:29.240]   than most Americans that were born here.
[00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:31.760]   That's crazy. Actually be foreign born national would be
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:35.800]   the most accurate term. Great. Whatever, whatever, whatever
[00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:38.520]   dumb term, I'm just using the ones in the Constitution, the
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:41.840]   government is sorry, Jama for using accurate terms. I'll try
[00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:46.880]   to use less accurate terms in the future. So back to Jamie,
[00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:48.440]   Jamie Dimon,
[00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:52.680]   nobody here is questioning whether he is a supreme competent
[00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:57.880]   executive, fully grant that he's done an amazing job. Taking JP
[00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:00.200]   Morgan, it was ready the biggest he's made it even bigger.
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:03.120]   How is that possible? Whether that's a good thing? I'm saying
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:04.920]   we got to stop the banks from getting bigger.
[00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:08.160]   Yeah, whether that's a good thing for the country, ultimately
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:11.000]   is a different question. Yeah, no one questions his competence
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.480]   and his expertise. But again, I see no groundswell for him in
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:17.480]   either the Democratic Party or the Republican Party, or even as
[00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:21.160]   an independent because again, it doesn't fit the populist mood of
[00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:22.160]   the country right now.
[00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:27.840]   Got it. So that's your pragmatic, like path to victory.
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:29.800]   But let me ask you about competence, then because maybe I
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:32.120]   can frame the question get a better answer out of you. That's
[00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:34.240]   what I thought I was answering when you said who's more
[00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:36.960]   competent? I mean, you guys interpret my questions. How have
[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:39.720]   you like you interpreted in terms of competence? sacks
[00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:42.000]   interpreted the question of pragmatical ability to getting
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.960]   into office. But let's ask sacks the question. And I'll ask you
[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:49.600]   pragmatically unless sacks the question of competence. In terms
[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:51.960]   of competence, I gave you like four people, right? Is he the
[00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:54.600]   most competent person to run the country right now? No, I
[00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:56.640]   you think the Santa is more competent than him.
[00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:59.520]   I think that of all the major candidates who actually have a
[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:03.160]   realistic shot. DeSantis is the most supremely competent as an
[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:06.840]   executive. He's run the state of Florida. He did it during COVID,
[00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:10.880]   which was a major crisis. We all saw what happened. All of our
[00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:15.080]   friends were leaving California because California had
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:17.960]   lockdowns, schools were closed, we had the worst learning loss
[00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:21.600]   of any state small businesses were going under our toddlers
[00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:24.560]   had to wear these stupid, pointless cloth masks to school
[00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:30.360]   when they finally Jamie reopen. Hold on. So DeSantis kept
[00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:33.920]   Florida open. They had a great economy. It's number one in job
[00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:36.560]   creation, investment, people moving there heard the speech
[00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:38.640]   balance the budget. And that's why he was able to grow his
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:42.720]   majority from under 1% when he first got elected to 20 points.
[00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:45.920]   So you believe he would be more qualified than Jamie dime?
[00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:47.400]   Sat at your mouth? Yeah.
[00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:51.920]   He's actually been tested in a political realm.
[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:55.200]   Got it. You see, you think that is the better test? I disagree.
[00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:58.040]   And I think probably the number one thing you have to do to be
[00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:01.800]   effective politically, is to be able to understand when the
[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:04.320]   media, the mainstream media and all their fake experts are
[00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:07.200]   wrong. Because that's why the country's in such a mess. We
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:09.640]   keep listening to all these fake experts who are wrong about
[00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:11.280]   everything, including COVID.
[00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:13.000]   Did Trump do a good job as president in your mind?
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.760]   He listened to the fake experts. He had Fauci in there.
[00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:17.840]   So you don't think Trump did a good job as president
[00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:20.040]   on COVID? He listened to Fauci too much.
[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:22.360]   But okay, because Trump was an outsider. And you seem to think
[00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:24.600]   he did a good job as president. And a lot of Republicans do. So
[00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:26.240]   that's my point. He was an outsider.
[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:29.160]   You love putting words in my mouth and characterizing. I'm,
[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:32.160]   I'm asking you a good job in ways that I never quite said,
[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:35.160]   okay, I'm just asking you, I think I think that Trump did a
[00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:37.760]   number of good things in office. For example, he kept us out of
[00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:41.440]   foreign wars. And I think the economy was pretty good until
[00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:46.040]   COVID. But yeah, he had no political. I would say they were
[00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:50.480]   like two big Achilles heels. One was, we had huge deficits and
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:53.840]   debt during Trump. And the other was, once COVID happened, he
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:57.520]   listened to Fauci. And Fauci was driving the train during COVID.
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:01.480]   And hold on gave us the lockdowns. And then Trump never
[00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:04.440]   fired Fauci. And on Trump's last day in office,
[00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:05.040]   He gave him a medal.
[00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:12.720]   Insane. Insane. And just so everybody remembers, June 16,
[00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:16.760]   2015, Ben Carson and businessman Donald Trump tied in
[00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:19.080]   fourth place with 5%. So things can change.
[00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:22.760]   And now Trump is swinging wildly at DeSantis saying that DeSantis
[00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:25.680]   was worse than Cuomo on COVID.
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:28.400]   Oh, gosh, I really do not want to relitigate that. That's the
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:30.880]   last thing I want to relitigate is COVID. Man, we got bigger
[00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:31.480]   fish to fry.
[00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:33.640]   DeSantis, I think, has been doing really well over the last
[00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:36.360]   week, because Trump has been making all these wild attacks on
[00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:41.240]   him. And DeSantis has been responding. So now like they're
[00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:43.440]   they're really punching at each other. It's really interesting.
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:45.280]   Let's pivot to the debt ceiling real quick here. The House
[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:49.120]   voted overwhelmingly to pass the debt ceiling agreement 314 to
[00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:53.120]   117. It's in the hands of the Senate can be passed by the time
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:56.320]   you're listening to this. Some Republicans think the spending
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:59.720]   didn't go far enough. No shocker there. But Speaker McCarthy
[00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:03.240]   called it a first step projected the bill would reduce budget
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:07.360]   deficits by 1.5 trillion over the next decade. Some
[00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:13.840]   highlights, non defense spending flat in 2024 at 704 billion only
[00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:18.880]   increases 1% in 2025 and aims to limit federal budget growth to
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:24.400]   1% for the next six years. For since 30 billion in unspent
[00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:28.400]   COVID relief money. That seems logical fully funds medical care
[00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:32.920]   for veterans. That seems like a good idea. reallocates 20
[00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:35.960]   billion from the IRS over the next two years to put towards
[00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:41.160]   non defense programs. That's that crazy idea to hire 80,000
[00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:44.520]   or something IRS agents pauses on student loan repayments will
[00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:47.680]   now end in August. We've talked about that on the show. Biden
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:49.960]   student loan forgiveness plan will be settled in the Supreme
[00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:55.360]   Court. Some stats on us debt, put up two charts here and then
[00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:57.920]   I'll get free birch position because he's very passionate
[00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:03.440]   about this US annual surplus or deficits through end of year
[00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:08.160]   2022. See those great years. I think those are the democratic
[00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:14.160]   calm Clinton years. Did ran it up. Well done Clinton, US
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:21.720]   national debt, end of year 2022. My Lord 32 getting close to 32
[00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:27.000]   trillion US annual federal spending up around breaking six
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.600]   trillion a year and tax revenue by deficit here.
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:33.920]   You have it go to that the red chart. This is the our national
[00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:37.360]   debt. This is a upside down hockey stick. So this is what's
[00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:40.040]   concerning about it is we're going exponential on this thing.
[00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:45.320]   The problem with this, just to reframe it once again for the
[00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:48.400]   100,000 time. Wait a sec. Wait, this red chart isn't this free
[00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:49.880]   birds losses in Vegas this weekend.
[00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:54.440]   I think that's, oh, no, that's our collective losses in Vegas
[00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:57.880]   this weekend. I think we did the math. This group was accounted
[00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:01.800]   for 10 minutes, 10 minutes of Vegas is blackjack revenue for
[00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:05.640]   the year. So good job, everyone. Good job, people. Everybody in
[00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:09.560]   Vegas is now completed their q3 quarter targets early.
[00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:14.840]   So the problem, obviously, with mounting debt is the interest
[00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:17.600]   payments on the debt cause you to take out more debt. And
[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:21.440]   there's a tipping point where it becomes insurmountable. And
[00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:24.280]   there are many people sounding the alarm that we may be
[00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:26.760]   entering that point that in order to fund the interest
[00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:30.920]   obligations on the debt, we need to take out more debt. And then
[00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:33.080]   there's more interest payments, and therefore there's more debt
[00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:36.400]   and it just keeps getting bigger and bigger. And so this chart
[00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:40.280]   I'm sharing here is actually from the federal government's
[00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:43.280]   GAO, the government accountability office, which
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:46.040]   acts almost like an independent accounting and forecasting body
[00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:49.920]   trying to provide some outlook on the fiscal condition of the
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:53.720]   federal government. And this is an analysis I think they put out
[00:33:53.720 --> 00:34:00.080]   a few weeks ago, showing that as of the fiscal year 22, 8% of the
[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:03.560]   overall federal budget was going towards interest spending by
[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:08.560]   fiscal year 25. It'll be 26%. And then net interest spending
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:11.560]   will need to grow to half of the budget. But if you go to the
[00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:12.200]   other side,
[00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:14.400]   why don't you say that? Why don't you say the years because
[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:16.880]   it's important to know what years they're talking about.
[00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:21.600]   2051 2096 is what they're showing. This is a long window.
[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:24.080]   Yeah, I get it. But let me show you this chart. Just pull up the
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:26.800]   first chart. So this is our federal government's interest
[00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:30.880]   payments per year. And so this is how much the government pays
[00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:33.960]   on interest for the debt. By the way, most of the debt is getting
[00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:36.680]   refinanced now at the higher interest rates, because a lot of
[00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:42.800]   this debt was sitting in Zerp era since 2008. But as the debt
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:46.520]   has to get refinanced, and more debt is taken on to fund the
[00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:48.680]   interest payment obligations, the interest payment actually
[00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:50.920]   starts to mount more significantly. And that's what
[00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:54.600]   we've seen in the last two fiscal years in particular. Now
[00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:57.880]   when you take this chart, and you overlay how much we spend on
[00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:03.320]   defense. So here's defense spending. We are, I think, as of
[00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:06.680]   this month or last month now spending more, the federal
[00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:10.000]   government is spending more on interest payments on the federal
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.720]   debt than they are on national defense. Whether we believe we
[00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:16.880]   are spending money on national defense in a smart way or in an
[00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:18.920]   accountable way, or whether these are good strategic
[00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:22.600]   priorities and good strategic decisions. The fact remains that
[00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:26.160]   at some point here, our ability to actually fund the programs
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:28.440]   that we want to fund, whether they're social security,
[00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:31.960]   Medicare, or defense, the major cost outlays for the federal
[00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:35.600]   government, it's going to get further hindered, and continually
[00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:37.760]   more hindered by the fact that these interest payments are
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:40.440]   climbing so significantly. If you go to the third chart, I
[00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:43.360]   think it kind of provides the final point, which is social
[00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:47.240]   security. And we're very quickly seeing interest payments mount
[00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:51.240]   to the point of where social security spending lays. And when
[00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:54.040]   that happens, obviously, as you guys know, everyone talks about
[00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:56.720]   that as being the golden program, the right and the left,
[00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:58.600]   the Democrats and the Republicans simply will not
[00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:02.800]   touch social security, from a policy perspective from a
[00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:06.800]   getting elected perspective, but the economic and arithmetic
[00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:09.560]   reality is running up against them, which is that the interest
[00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:13.040]   payments on the debt are starting to threaten our ability
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:16.360]   to fund social security and Medicare. There's many more
[00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:19.160]   charts we could pull up to highlight this, the Republicans
[00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:23.080]   in announcing the debt deal this week, made a lot of
[00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:25.840]   proclamations about it being a win and showed how we were able
[00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:30.520]   to reduce spending by $2 trillion. I think the statement
[00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:33.960]   they made the deal cuts $2.1 trillion in spending over the
[00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:36.160]   six year life of the bill and one and a half trillion dollars
[00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:40.000]   in statutorily mandated savings over the next two years, $2.1
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.760]   trillion over six years, remember, we're talking about a
[00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:47.600]   seven million $7 trillion per year budget. So that's $42
[00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:51.440]   trillion over those six years, we're cutting 2 trillion of 42.
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:56.680]   So it's a 5% impact to start. It's a start. But what leverage
[00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:58.680]   do they have now? And I think that
[00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:02.800]   census Friedberg that they actually did decide to make
[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:05.320]   cuts. And that feels to me and we did predict here that they
[00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:08.360]   would get this done. Does feel to me like this is some amount
[00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:11.080]   of progress, right? I mean, do you feel good about it or
[00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:12.840]   indifferent? Friedberg?
[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:17.720]   I think you guys know, I think that there's, we have to tackle
[00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:23.200]   the structural problem of revenue spending interest rates.
[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:29.160]   Those are like, very big numbers that are challenging each other,
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:35.120]   chipping away at the spending doesn't quite get us there. And,
[00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:38.400]   you know, it doesn't seem like there's a clear path here. Even
[00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:41.040]   you know, the argument that RFK made when he came on our show,
[00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:43.920]   RFK Jr. made when he came on our show, that cutting military
[00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:46.520]   spending would have an impact. I mean, you guys see military
[00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:48.000]   spending is already starting to get
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.520]   overtaken by the interest payment spending. So does that
[00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:55.040]   really move the needle? I think it's going to be an economic
[00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:58.480]   reality that all programs are going to need to be cut back in
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:01.560]   order to fund the debt obligations, or we're going to
[00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:02.680]   see massive inflation.
[00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:06.040]   Not do you feel I guess, my question was, do you feel like
[00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:11.840]   this was a good step or a good signal that maybe the government
[00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:15.080]   is, and our representatives are getting the message that they
[00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:16.760]   need to make some cuts at some point,
[00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:22.040]   I don't think that there's any way to provide the necessary
[00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:26.520]   fiscal security for the federal government, without bipartisan
[00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:31.120]   unitary support around the objective, which is to get to a
[00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:34.080]   balanced budget and to reduce the overall debt and interest
[00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:38.080]   payment obligations. And if you can't start from that point,
[00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:40.960]   it's this push and pull over what programs get cut, but I
[00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:43.720]   want more money being spent. I want to have a pipeline. I want
[00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:43.800]   to
[00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:46.040]   you're not super enthused by this. I thought it was a
[00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:49.400]   positive step. Chamath, you have talked about refinancing the
[00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:52.480]   debt, putting the hundred year trillion dollar coin, whatever
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:56.760]   we wind up doing refinancing this on a long arc 50 year 100
[00:38:56.760 --> 00:39:02.160]   year arc. What does this debt ceiling, reconciliation or
[00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:04.920]   whatever, we're going to call it, but they came to some sort
[00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:07.880]   of agreement here signal to you, you predicted they would get
[00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:09.520]   through this pretty easily. So yeah.
[00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:13.280]   Boring, nothing burger, nothing, move on.
[00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:14.560]   Okay. So,
[00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:19.320]   would you buy 100 year bond from the federal government?
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:21.040]   If I was a foreign government? Yes.
[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:24.560]   What interest would you need to get paid on that? To take that
[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:24.800]   on?
[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:26.960]   Probably one to 2%.
[00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:29.240]   One to 2% for 100 years?
[00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:31.680]   Yeah. So it would be downside protection, you just feel like
[00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:35.160]   this is a secure place to put some amount of money.
[00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:41.800]   This is how any, any country with a turbulent currency would
[00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:45.120]   make this decision. And you could actually get close to zero.
[00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:48.160]   I think that when we had Zerp, you probably could have charged
[00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:50.240]   a negative interest rate, because you would have
[00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:52.840]   effectively been charging countries, third world
[00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:55.560]   developing countries, even first world countries that just wanted
[00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:59.040]   a protective mechanism against their currency volatility, they
[00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:02.480]   would have probably paid you just like today, you can get BOJ
[00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:07.320]   debt. That's negative yielding. So it's no longer negative, but
[00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:10.280]   it's still probably in the realm of one, one and a half percent.
[00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:13.600]   It's nothing if you just do the math, it's nothing. And this is
[00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:15.800]   why I don't understand why everybody just gets their
[00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:16.840]   underwear in a bunch here.
[00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:20.400]   Okay, non gender underpants, put the red chart up there.
[00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:26.960]   Nothing. It's a nothing. It's a nothing. It's a nothing. It's a
[00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:27.920]   hockey stick. Nothing
[00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:31.440]   means nothing. I think you guys see here is an accelerating
[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:34.400]   problem. Yeah, cut revenue, the debt is getting bigger and
[00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:37.920]   bigger at the same time that foreign governments and
[00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:41.840]   investors in general don't want to fund our debt. So therefore,
[00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:44.040]   interest rates will rise, our interest costs will keep going
[00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:47.080]   on why interest rates are going up? Well, if they're going up,
[00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:49.240]   because the Fed is raising rates of inflation, but at the same
[00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:52.160]   time, that's happening. Foreign governments are not as
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:56.680]   interested in having dollar reserves and US Treasuries said
[00:40:56.680 --> 00:40:58.600]   who does demonstrated by what
[00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:03.200]   you look at the foreign reserves of these countries, these
[00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:05.600]   sovereigns, they are much less interested in holding us
[00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:08.760]   treasuries for China, starting with China and all the BRICS
[00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:09.360]   countries,
[00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:12.920]   foreign reserves are up. These guys are banking us dollars like
[00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:13.800]   nobody's business.
[00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:16.600]   I don't think so. I think it's been going down since 2008. I'll
[00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:17.360]   find you a chart.
[00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:20.800]   Yeah, maybe from 2008. I don't know from the great financial
[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:23.520]   crisis at the absolute depths. But what I'm saying is that in
[00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:27.680]   general, the anchor currency for governments and central banks
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:32.920]   has been will be and will likely be in the future, the United
[00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:36.040]   States dollar. And we get back to the circular argument, which
[00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:40.160]   is, I don't think it's possible for politicians to cut expenses.
[00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:44.080]   So I am just an advocate for cutting revenue, because I do
[00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:47.600]   think it's the simplest way to force people because the next
[00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:50.240]   time they go through these machinations and all this
[00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:54.200]   theater around a debt ceiling, they'll just have less revenue
[00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:56.600]   to play with. And it'll just become a harder and harder and
[00:41:56.600 --> 00:42:00.280]   harder problem. Meanwhile, I do think that you have to take the
[00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:03.920]   ball where it lies and take these 24 or $30 trillion and
[00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:07.920]   refinance it well out into the future and make a bet on us
[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:10.760]   exceptionalism and us GDP. And if you don't want to believe it,
[00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:13.400]   don't fucking be here. Move to some other country where you
[00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:15.120]   think it's so much better and go do it there.
[00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:17.440]   But tomorrow, what if the market's not there? What if the
[00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:18.800]   buyers are not there and you're wrong?
[00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:22.680]   Sure. I mean, you know what an asteroid could hit the earth in
[00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:25.080]   the next day, we could talk about all kinds of long tail
[00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:28.040]   consequences. But there is there you have to be able to
[00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:31.320]   probably wait these things and then spend your time thinking
[00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:34.200]   about the things that are more probabilistic, and be able to
[00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:37.600]   compartmentalize the anxiety of the less probabilistic things.
[00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:42.320]   So I think that could there be a scenario where there is no
[00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:45.160]   interest? Sure. Is there one? No, because you see every day
[00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:47.760]   the government's in the market doing auctions, and there is a
[00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:52.240]   robust demand for United States government debt. And until there
[00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:55.880]   isn't, this argument is specious. And all I would tell
[00:42:55.880 --> 00:43:00.680]   you is just keep trying. Put out more try a 45 euro bond and see
[00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:03.600]   how it feels like try a 50 year you don't have to do 100. If it
[00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:05.080]   makes you too anxious, that's fine.
[00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:06.920]   Let me just ask you at some point, if the market isn't
[00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:10.040]   there, the buyers are not there, then you know,
[00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:13.040]   but let's just go through the analysis, because I know that
[00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:15.400]   you think it's it's a zero chance. But if it's as low
[00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:19.280]   probability, do you agree that the severity is high, that the
[00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:21.160]   significance of that being the case, I don't
[00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:25.920]   again, I am not going to give an iota of breath to a long tail
[00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:30.360]   five sigma outcome, it is a waste of time. Okay, because it
[00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:33.800]   occupies I don't tell you why I don't do it, it occupies my mind
[00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:37.120]   share, which takes away from me figuring out how to make money
[00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:41.920]   and win on the field today. So I have, you know, I wake in a 24
[00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:45.040]   hour day, okay, just to give you a sense of it, I sleep for eight,
[00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:48.920]   you know, I'm eating for another one or two, all this bullshit, I
[00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:54.320]   have four or five hours a day of useful thinking time. And I try
[00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:59.000]   to think of the belly of the probable. And I try to
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:02.840]   compartmentalize these dumb long tail sigma events, because it
[00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:06.440]   distracts me from making money and winning. I actually try to
[00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:09.080]   think about long tail sigma events that could make me money.
[00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:13.680]   This isn't one of them. So I just don't spend time thinking
[00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:16.520]   about it. I could be totally wrong. Pull up this totally
[00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:19.160]   wrong. Pull up this chart work for me so far. And I'm going to
[00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:21.680]   stick to what works guys. Saxe has been on Google for five
[00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:23.320]   minutes. He's got something for you tomorrow. Go ahead.
[00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:25.480]   You should stick to the investing strategy that works
[00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:31.000]   for you. I'd like to talk about the status of US treasuries. So
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:34.400]   if you look here, this is total foreign treasury holdings as
[00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:37.160]   percent of marketable treasury securities. So it's gone down
[00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:43.160]   from the mid 50s to the low 30s since 2008 2009 as a percentage
[00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:48.320]   so foreign governments don't want our treasuries as much as
[00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:51.040]   they used to starting with China, they are diversifying
[00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:55.400]   into other currencies and gold. And there are a bunch of good
[00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:58.520]   reasons for that. By the way, this comes from a blog, which is
[00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:01.520]   really interesting. It's a crypto guy named Arthur Hayes.
[00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:04.320]   And this is actually a pretty interesting piece called exit
[00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:08.240]   liquidity. He writes interesting pieces on the banking system and
[00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:11.080]   de dollarization. He's got a little bit of a doomer thesis
[00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:14.760]   with respect to the US dollar. And obviously he's pro Bitcoin,
[00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:18.080]   his views are sort of similar to apologies. But in any event, I
[00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:20.360]   think one of the points he makes that's really interesting is
[00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:24.720]   that if you're to zoom out 30,000 feet, and think about the
[00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:28.840]   regime that we had during let's call it the unipolar moment
[00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:32.840]   where China and the United States were strong trading
[00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:36.480]   partners, and we had this close relationship with them. The way
[00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:40.800]   the global economy worked is that China would sell goods to
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:44.560]   the United States, they would have huge trade surpluses. And
[00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:47.320]   then they would take those dollars, and they'd use some of
[00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:50.000]   them to buy raw materials like energy that was called the
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:54.200]   petro dollar. And then they would take other dollars their
[00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:57.400]   surplus and instead of repatriating at home, they would
[00:45:57.400 --> 00:46:00.160]   have to have then convert that money into RMB and brought it
[00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:02.720]   home. They didn't do that that actually would have increased
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:05.000]   the value of their currency thereby making their exports
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.560]   less attractive. This is why they are accused of currency
[00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:11.320]   manipulation, they took their surplus dollars and bought us
[00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:16.000]   assets, mainly us treasuries. So we had this trading relationship
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.640]   with China, I think everyone understands the physical world
[00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:20.720]   side of that trading relationship where you had us
[00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:23.600]   manufacturing jobs got exported to China, they basically made
[00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:26.080]   everything a lot of cheap goods came into the US, they had a
[00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:28.840]   trade surplus. What I think people don't understand is that
[00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:32.880]   a huge part of that trade surplus was used to finance us
[00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:36.760]   deficits and debt. And so you had this like cozy relationship
[00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:41.360]   between us, elites, US politicians and China, where
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:43.640]   they got to rack up these huge deficits, the government got to
[00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:47.920]   spend a lot of money. And China would fund it very cheaply. But
[00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:50.680]   now that's all ended that stopped, because we're basically
[00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:54.680]   starting to decouple from China. So China doesn't want to do its
[00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:57.360]   business in dollars if they don't have to, obviously, for
[00:46:57.360 --> 00:47:00.280]   the products they sell at the US, they'll take dollars, but
[00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:03.880]   they're already trying to do as many transactions as they can.
[00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:07.760]   Buying oil, for example, or energy in RMB.
[00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:10.680]   I don't want to dispute this chart, because this chart is
[00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:14.640]   true. But it's a small part of how the entire puzzle works. And
[00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:18.600]   so this is a Bitcoin maximalist, who cherry picks a few data
[00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:21.640]   points to try to make a point. But if you look at the IMF data,
[00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:24.280]   and I put it to you in the group chat, you can't just look at us
[00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:27.280]   Treasury securities, you have to look at actual absolute dollar
[00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:29.840]   reserves. And when you look at that over time, it hasn't
[00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:32.720]   fluctuated that much. And so for all the dopes that don't
[00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:35.640]   understand how this shit works, it's not just securities, it's
[00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:40.040]   actually also money. And the actual amount of US dollar money
[00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:44.160]   hasn't changed that much gone between 60 and 70%. So it's just
[00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:47.720]   and so sure, I just find this argument, again, one of these
[00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:51.680]   long sigma arguments that are anxiety riddled, and I just
[00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:53.480]   don't want to waste my time thinking about it, because it'll
[00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:55.360]   distract me from winning on the field today.
[00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:58.080]   You got to be able to block things out if you want to be a
[00:47:58.080 --> 00:48:01.120]   capital allocator. I agree. But an interesting discussion
[00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:01.840]   nonetheless.
[00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:04.400]   I don't think these things are just noise. I think you're
[00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:07.760]   seeing a trend. I mean, look how many headlines are about the
[00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:10.280]   BRICS countries getting together and starting to
[00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:13.040]   transact in currencies other than dollars.
[00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:15.040]   Yeah, you know what, those are very cherry picked as well. And
[00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:16.960]   you said before, you don't trust the press. So you trust the
[00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:19.600]   press on these headlines, all of a sudden, I don't think that
[00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:20.560]   that's actually
[00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:23.800]   I don't think anyone's disputing the fact that China and Saudi
[00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:28.320]   Arabia and China and Brazil are doing energy transactions in R
[00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:28.720]   and B
[00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:31.280]   I think it's very tiny. They're doing or putting all their money
[00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:33.360]   into venture capital in the West, private equity in the
[00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:34.880]   rest real estate in the West,
[00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:36.480]   the Middle East.
[00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:39.320]   That's where they're, that's where they're focusing their
[00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:39.600]   energy.
[00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:42.920]   There's a different issue. Look, no one is disputing the fact
[00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:45.640]   that China and the BRICS countries more generally are
[00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:48.720]   trying to create a trading block that is not dependent on the US
[00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:52.760]   dollar. I think they are gradually the same rattling. It's
[00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:56.000]   like, I think they're trying to just let the US know like, hey,
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:58.160]   we have other options here. And I think it's China just trying
[00:48:58.160 --> 00:49:03.040]   to it's China on their heels, trying to make deals with other
[00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:06.520]   folks trying to pursuing their self interest, which is not to
[00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:10.080]   be dependent on a dollar that's been weaponized and controlled
[00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:13.160]   by the US politically, you can be sure that Saudi UAE and the
[00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:15.560]   entire voting bloc in the Middle East are shipping their money
[00:49:15.560 --> 00:49:16.560]   West not East.
[00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:19.400]   I think you have a very accurate assessment of what China wants,
[00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:21.560]   but it doesn't mean it's going to happen. And I think you have
[00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:24.240]   to make a bet. What do you think it's going to happen or not? I
[00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:26.360]   bet it's not going to happen. And I think the reason I said
[00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:29.960]   this before is China is in a demographic time bomb. And that
[00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:33.200]   will dominate everything else that is a country that is in
[00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:36.680]   floating and they're anti capitalist, they're anti
[00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:39.600]   capitalism. No, no, I'm going to say that they are capitalists.
[00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:41.360]   I'm not going to make these judgments. But I'm going to tell
[00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:44.040]   you practically speaking is they are demographically imploding.
[00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:48.160]   They do not have enough people, the country will be halved by
[00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:52.800]   the death rate and the lack of birth rate by 2300. Okay, so in
[00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:57.040]   another 70 odd years, that is a problem that is going away. And
[00:49:57.040 --> 00:50:00.760]   that is just mathematical. And if you just again, you just have
[00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:04.000]   to take a deep breath, look at the data and just extrapolate
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:07.480]   and you see, this is not a problem. China is not a problem.
[00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:10.120]   China has real problems. There's no question about it. They've
[00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:12.560]   got demographic problems. They've got problems in the
[00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:15.520]   banking system. They've got a real estate bubble, startup
[00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:18.720]   problems. There are questions about whether the leadership now
[00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:21.200]   is turning away from the capitalism that got them to this
[00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:25.600]   point. So there's no question that China has problems. But you
[00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:29.040]   want to talk about trends. There is a major trend in the world
[00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:32.840]   right now where you again, the BRICS countries, Brazil, Russia,
[00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:36.240]   India, China, South Africa, and you can put Saudi Arabia in that
[00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:40.040]   bucket and a lot of other countries, they are looking to
[00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:43.240]   diversify off of the dollar. I'm not saying that the dollar is
[00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:45.640]   going to stop being the world's reserve currency, because I
[00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:49.600]   agree with you that there's no ready replacement at hand. But
[00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:53.360]   they are trying to do as many transactions they can off of the
[00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:57.280]   dollar. And they do not want to hold treasuries like they did 10
[00:50:57.280 --> 00:50:58.800]   or 15 years ago. I don't
[00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:03.880]   transactions off the very loaded statement. I don't think that
[00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:06.480]   statement is true. What are you talking about? This is like
[00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:10.400]   major. No, they tried to do one trade, China and Saudi and China
[00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:13.840]   and no, Saudi and China talked about it, and they didn't do it.
[00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:16.640]   They talked about Yeah, I would like to see on that not just a
[00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:19.120]   couple of headlines, because I think everybody wants to
[00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:22.080]   know what are you talking about? It was the data, the Brazil
[00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:24.960]   thing happened, but I think it was a small trade, David. Yeah,
[00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:26.880]   that's what Yeah, that's exactly your first you're saying it
[00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:28.960]   didn't happen. And now you're saying, I'm saying the Saudi
[00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:32.400]   Arabia, China thing did not happen. Your statement was
[00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:35.120]   they're trying to do as many transactions as possible off the
[00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:36.640]   dollar. I don't think they're trying to do as many
[00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:41.280]   transactions off the dollar. I don't have never seen any actual
[00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:45.240]   data. You don't know support is making shit up. No, you're
[00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:48.480]   forcing the dollar. Of course, they want to get off the dollar
[00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:51.080]   if they can't. No, I think Jason saying you're right, what they
[00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:53.400]   want to do, but what they are doing China is what he's
[00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:57.000]   debating. They're trying to sending their money west. I
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:59.360]   don't think they're trying to send it. I don't think that's
[00:51:59.360 --> 00:51:59.600]   all.
[00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:03.240]   Hold on a second. You're right that Saudi Arabia is investing
[00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:06.720]   in the US. They're, I'd say, highly diversified. That's a
[00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:10.880]   little different than what China is doing. Yes, we are in
[00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:14.960]   agreement. China wants to get people off the US dollar. China's
[00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:17.320]   in decline. China's got big issues. We all agree on that.
[00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:20.200]   The Middle East has a lot of cash. I think if they're going
[00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:23.560]   to decide what to do with it, they'll appease China to have a
[00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:26.080]   solid relationship to ship oil there. But I think
[00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:27.480]   China's the number one customer now.
[00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:28.680]   China's the number one customer.
[00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:30.360]   And their hearts are in the West. That's where they're
[00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:31.600]   going to take China's money.
[00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:33.560]   There's been a giant local realignment. Haven't you noticed?
[00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:35.440]   I think the realignment is
[00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:36.280]   The Chinese just negotiated
[00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:38.680]   The Middle East becoming westernized and being accepted
[00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:40.960]   in the West and moving towards an investor in the West in
[00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:42.560]   technology. That's actually the trend.
[00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:45.960]   The Chinese just negotiated or approached Mao between Saudi
[00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:48.920]   Arabia and Iran. Did you notice that?
[00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:52.080]   That's a fine idea. I'm just talking about where they're
[00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:54.320]   putting these things are all connected. Where are they
[00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:56.480]   putting their chips? I think what you've explained and I
[00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:59.560]   think we're in agreement. They'll sell their oil to China,
[00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:02.280]   then what do they do with the bag? They take that same bag,
[00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:03.360]   and they want to put it towards
[00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:06.880]   it's even worse. Again, the thing is, even if you settle a
[00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:10.200]   trade in the yuan, I think you guys keep forgetting this key
[00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:12.880]   thing, which is the yuan is pegged to the US dollar. So it
[00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:17.080]   is a proxy dollar. So if you really want to decouple, you
[00:53:17.080 --> 00:53:20.400]   first have to let this currency free float. They have no desire
[00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:22.640]   to let them do that, especially in a moment where they're
[00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:25.160]   economically imploding internally. So again, you go
[00:53:25.160 --> 00:53:27.680]   back to the circular argument where everything goes back to
[00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:30.360]   the dollar. So yes, they're saber rattling sacks. I
[00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:32.440]   acknowledge what you're saying. I think you're totally right
[00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:34.720]   that they would love a free floating currency.
[00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:35.600]   The Chinese would love
[00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:38.080]   Chinese and they want that free floating currency to not be
[00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:41.040]   pegged to the dollar. But right now, they have kept it pegged
[00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:41.640]   to the dollar.
[00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:46.800]   So I just do that. And it says not it says, I just googled is
[00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:50.600]   you on peg to USD and it says the Chinese yuan is not pegged
[00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:54.800]   to the US dollar was pegged from 94 to 2005. But in 2005, China
[00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:56.600]   made its currency a floating exchange currency.
[00:53:56.600 --> 00:54:00.000]   It is not a floating currency. Yeah. And then do you trust
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:00.800]   that? Yeah, who's
[00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:03.720]   highly manipulated? I agree with that. But I don't think it's
[00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:06.000]   pegged. It's not a floating currency. It is not a free
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:08.920]   floating currency. China controls the exchange rate
[00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:10.760]   between themselves and the US dollar.
[00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:16.000]   Let's move on. I think we've covered this. It'd be actually
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:17.200]   one thing that might be interesting
[00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:21.720]   reality, you have no basis for declaring that things like the
[00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:24.800]   moves that China is making with Brazil and Saudi Arabia, you're
[00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:26.400]   just declaring that to be fake news.
[00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:28.800]   Nobody's saying fake news. We're saying it's happening. But it's
[00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:30.840]   probably minor. And it's probably more described.
[00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:32.880]   What's your basis for believing that?
[00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:36.040]   Because we have no evidence to prove that it's occurring. We
[00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:39.400]   just have a couple of headlines and some small. But I mean,
[00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:43.040]   where is it? I mean, all we're seeing is the the, the money in
[00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:46.400]   Saudi Arabia is they're selling oil to China, correct, they're
[00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:49.440]   doing deals there, then they're taking that money. And then they
[00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:50.760]   want to invest it in the West.
[00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:51.760]   Who are you talking about?
[00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:54.480]   The other thing to keep in mind is that the Saudi real is pegged
[00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:58.040]   as well to the US dollar. And that's been there since I think
[00:54:58.040 --> 00:55:02.520]   the mid 80s. So China's is a very opaque, manipulated
[00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:06.840]   currency market where they keep the dollar yuan spread quite
[00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:11.400]   fixed. On the other side, Saudi has kept the same peg 3.75 to
[00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:14.720]   the dollar since the mid 80s. So again, it all just goes back to
[00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:16.880]   the US dollar. It's all proxies for the dollar. So there's some
[00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:20.840]   symbolic value, I suppose, in trading in yuan. But everything
[00:55:20.840 --> 00:55:23.640]   goes back to the dollar, because that's what it's measured in. So
[00:55:23.640 --> 00:55:23.880]   it's not
[00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:26.360]   I suppose it's not symbolic, what's happening is deeply
[00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:29.120]   geopolitical, you've got a couple of things going on. One
[00:55:29.120 --> 00:55:33.400]   is that the US has now instituted sanctions on over 40
[00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:37.560]   countries. Moreover, the whole world saw that in the case of
[00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:41.000]   Russia, we froze their foreign reserves, and basically seized
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:44.880]   the property of their oligarch. So if you're an oligarch in the
[00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:47.120]   Middle East, you think you want to keep all of your money on all
[00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:50.000]   of your reserves in dollars, you understand that the dollar has
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:52.600]   been weaponized as a political instrument in the United States.
[00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:55.680]   That's just a fact. So you're going to look to diversify,
[00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:57.080]   you're going to look to put your money in gold, you're going to
[00:55:57.080 --> 00:56:00.200]   look to put your money in other currencies. Is there like I said,
[00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:03.640]   a currency at hand that's ready to be a replacement for the US
[00:56:03.640 --> 00:56:06.280]   dollar? No, and it can't be the one they don't have an open
[00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:07.080]   capital.
[00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:11.800]   Where would you diversify if you were the CIO? Where would you
[00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:12.320]   diversify?
[00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:16.240]   Well, what I would do if I were the Secretary of the Treasury of
[00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:21.320]   China, is I would say that, okay, for the exports, the US
[00:56:21.320 --> 00:56:23.080]   we're going to keep getting dollars, and we'll do something
[00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:25.600]   with those dollars. But for everybody else, we're going to
[00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:27.960]   try and do as many transactions and RMB as possible.
[00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:29.840]   But what about the sellers of oil to China?
[00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:30.960]   What would they do?
[00:56:30.960 --> 00:56:34.840]   They get RMB. So you would tell them to keep the trades that
[00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:35.520]   we're talking about.
[00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:38.360]   You tell them to hold RMB over us and euro.
[00:56:38.360 --> 00:56:41.520]   China is seeking to pay Saudi Arabia and Brazil.
[00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:44.880]   If you're the CIO, I do understand it. I do understand.
[00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:48.920]   What I'm asking you is, let me ask you a question. Would you
[00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:53.440]   as CIO of Saudi or UAE, would you want to keep RMB? Would you
[00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:56.600]   want to keep euros or US dollars? Where would you want to
[00:56:56.600 --> 00:56:59.280]   keep your money? And the question is, if they sell that,
[00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:01.240]   would they want to keep it in RMB? I don't think they would
[00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:02.080]   want to keep the one
[00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:04.320]   honestly, to answer your question, I want to put it in
[00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:08.640]   gold. That's right. I would I put it in gold. Okay, here's
[00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:11.840]   what China is proposing. Okay. They're saying to Saudi Arabia
[00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:16.960]   and Brazil, we're going to pay you for your oil in RMB. And
[00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:20.160]   then you are going to take the RMB. And you can buy our
[00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:22.960]   products. Yeah, because again, we make everything we're the
[00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:26.760]   factory of the world. And if you still have a surplus, after
[00:57:26.760 --> 00:57:30.880]   that, you can settle that surplus in gold. Because Beijing
[00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:34.160]   has a very liquid, you know, gold exchange market. They're
[00:57:34.160 --> 00:57:36.240]   giving them. That's what they're proposing. Here's your gift
[00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:38.920]   cards. Spend gift cards,
[00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:42.140]   two data points on this axe that I just read. It's in this
[00:57:42.140 --> 00:57:44.000]   Barron's article that I included, Nick, you may just
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:45.820]   want to link to it in the show notes, which I thought was
[00:57:45.820 --> 00:57:48.360]   pretty good swift, which is sort of like the international
[00:57:48.360 --> 00:57:53.440]   payments backbone, the share of yuan transactions briefly rose
[00:57:53.440 --> 00:57:59.840]   above 3%. In 2022, that was the peak, and it's now off 26%, down
[00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:03.320]   to about 2.2%. So actually, the share of yuan transactions has
[00:58:03.320 --> 00:58:05.840]   actually been shrinking in the last year. And then the second
[00:58:05.840 --> 00:58:08.280]   is that what this article states, which is interesting is
[00:58:08.280 --> 00:58:11.480]   that all the belt and road loans that China gave into all these
[00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:14.160]   developing countries in Africa, the Africans were like, we don't
[00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:17.320]   want this you want and so they just dollar swapped. And so now
[00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:20.120]   the BRI loans are all serviced in US dollars as well. So all
[00:58:20.120 --> 00:58:23.240]   the trillions of dollars China spent. I'm just saying that
[00:58:23.280 --> 00:58:27.040]   again, I'm not judging their own alternative swift. We weaponize
[00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:28.200]   swift as well. So
[00:58:28.200 --> 00:58:31.040]   swift is still 98% of the of the world of how it works. All I'm
[00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:35.040]   saying is, I just like to look keep things simple. I think the
[00:58:35.040 --> 00:58:38.480]   US dollars here for a while, I think that debt suck. I would
[00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:42.280]   love to have no deficits. But I also think these numbers are
[00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:45.320]   roughly like we're playing plus or minus on the margin two to
[00:58:45.320 --> 00:58:49.040]   300 basis points. We talked about that last week. And so I
[00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:52.880]   want to keep my brain open to the simple, obvious things like
[00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:54.560]   you know, selling.
[00:58:54.560 --> 00:58:59.200]   That's what it's come to is CPG for you. trumath. You're like,
[00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:02.320]   it's a downmarket CPG guy. Now. Yeah, that's where trumath
[00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:02.800]   focused.
[00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:04.920]   Why don't you pull freeberg into this debate? I have one more
[00:59:04.920 --> 00:59:07.120]   that's what I was about to do. I'm a doctor doom. Go ahead.
[00:59:07.120 --> 00:59:10.280]   Dr. So I think I'm a doctor doom. I'm just Dr. reality, or
[00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:12.240]   at least I try to be I don't know, like there was a deal,
[00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:16.160]   you know, China had a big visit with Brazil in March, we talked
[00:59:16.160 --> 00:59:19.200]   about it briefly, I shared a couple of these articles that
[00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:22.280]   covered the transactions, they signed $10 billion of trade
[00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:25.280]   agreements and cooperative agreements, all of which were
[00:59:25.280 --> 00:59:28.240]   meant to settle in yuan. Brazil's kind of made the
[00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:29.920]   statement that they're going to start to settle in local
[00:59:29.920 --> 00:59:35.440]   currency. And, you know, they're doing this multilateral trade
[00:59:35.440 --> 00:59:39.040]   program globally, with partners where they're going to trade and
[00:59:39.040 --> 00:59:42.280]   transact in local currencies, they're not set to the dollar,
[00:59:42.280 --> 00:59:44.600]   they're not fixed to the dollar. And I think that's just part of
[00:59:44.600 --> 00:59:46.760]   a general movement. I don't think it's about, hey, we got to
[00:59:46.760 --> 00:59:48.960]   get off the dollar as soon as possible. But I think it's about
[00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:51.600]   we could diversify. And there are other stable economies
[00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:54.360]   around the world, they might be having, you know, demographic
[00:59:54.360 --> 00:59:57.520]   issues or various economic issues. But gosh, man, don't we
[00:59:57.520 --> 01:00:01.520]   all Europe, China, the US, everyone's got debt problems,
[01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:04.640]   demographic problems, over leverage problems, growth
[01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:07.880]   problems. And fundamentally, I don't think that there's as safe
[01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:10.640]   a haven as there has been historically. And as a result,
[01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:12.080]   I think a lot of these governments and a lot of the
[01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:15.120]   business leaders in these countries are very much open to
[01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:18.060]   doing transactions in multiple currencies. And that's the
[01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:20.920]   beginning of the end, it's the beginning of a set of
[01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:23.920]   transactions that isn't about, hey, we're all getting against
[01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:26.800]   the dollar, it's over, let's crush the dollar. It's like,
[01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:28.800]   we're just going to do trades and other currencies. No big
[01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:29.080]   deal.
[01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:36.360]   Beginning of the end. Doctor Do. All right. Shout out. It's the
[01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:38.360]   end of the dominance, right? It's the end of you every
[01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:40.880]   talking about the end of the dominance and China imploded
[01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:43.760]   during that same time period. So I forgive me, I still believe
[01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:45.120]   in American exceptionalism.
[01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:47.680]   From American exceptionalism. When there's another article
[01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:51.760]   from Bloomberg bricks, this is from April 24. All of a sudden,
[01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:54.800]   this guy loves the mainstream draws membership bids from 1984.
[01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:58.080]   Listen, Jake, I'm fine. If you want to say this is fake news,
[01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:02.160]   go for it. Are you saying it's just funny? Believe it's fake
[01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:08.040]   news? No, I need information about the world. When they write
[01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:10.080]   an article about me, that's completely made up. I'm going
[01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:13.200]   to call it fake news. Why are you treating like every press
[01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:15.280]   article is like the same. That makes no sense.
[01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:18.160]   By the way, it does make sense for the bricks to expand, right
[01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:21.040]   sacks, because it's like if NATO was purely an economic
[01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:24.000]   organization, that's probably what bricks evolves into over
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.880]   time. And it makes a ton of sense for them to do it.
[01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:28.640]   They're creating a competing China setting up an alternative
[01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:31.960]   to the IMF. They've got this alternative to the IMF that
[01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:35.000]   they're setting up. That's not dollar denominated. And they've
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.320]   got seven nations in this thing. Now. It's it's, you know, and by
[01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:40.080]   the way, Jason, when I say the beginning of the end, I don't
[01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:42.800]   mean the end of the world or the end of the US, the US will
[01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:45.080]   continue to be the innovation hub of the world, the US will
[01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:48.000]   continue to have freedom and civil rights that no that no
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.880]   other country can parallel. The US is an incredible place to
[01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:54.480]   live better than anywhere else on earth. But the economic
[01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:57.640]   status of the US given how we have spent money, and how we
[01:01:57.640 --> 01:01:59.560]   continue to operate our federal government with this
[01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:02.600]   extraordinary deficit and debt spiral problem means that other
[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:05.360]   people have to be protective of their currencies and their
[01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:07.560]   assets in a way that's thoughtful. It doesn't
[01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:09.680]   necessarily mean it's all over and everything, but the
[01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:12.360]   dominance you said beginning was has had economically,
[01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:15.800]   you can already see this in all the trade barriers and tariffs
[01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:18.840]   that are going up the decoupling that's going on. Look, the
[01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:23.400]   United States set up a system of global free trade, basically in
[01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:28.680]   1945. And we had a bipolar world with we have the Soviets and
[01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:31.880]   you and in America, but the Soviets basically opted out
[01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:34.400]   because they were communists, they had their own system, but
[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:38.600]   it wasn't a compelling economy. Then we had the unipolar world.
[01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:42.880]   So basically, for, you know, over half a century, we had
[01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:45.640]   this completely open system where there were no trade blocks
[01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:49.440]   in the world. Now we are seeing the rise of trade blocks with
[01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:54.200]   multi polarity. Yes, the US is pursuing a contradictory policy
[01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:56.200]   because on the one hand, yeah, hold on, the here's the
[01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:59.880]   contradiction. On the one hand, we run these massive deficits
[01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:04.320]   and debts. So we are a debtor nation who needs to make its
[01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:09.560]   debt attractive to debt holders or our interest rates going to
[01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:12.920]   keep going up. Okay, so that's on the one hand. On the other
[01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:16.120]   hand, we are doing things like weaponizing the dollar and
[01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:21.360]   weaponizing swift and imposing sanctions and engaging in
[01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:26.920]   geopolitical fights that are highly antagonistic to the
[01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:32.200]   nations that are would be holders of our debt. So one of
[01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:38.640]   those two things has got to give either we reduce our debt and
[01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:41.480]   our deficits and the need we're remember we're not this is not a
[01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:46.040]   stable situation. We continue to issue what is it somewhere
[01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:50.400]   between one and 2 trillion a year to government debt. So we
[01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:54.000]   have to constantly find more and more money out in the world to
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:57.000]   support our debt at the same time that we're weaponizing the
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:00.480]   dollar in the financial system so that these sources of global
[01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:02.480]   capital don't want to participate. And I agree with
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:06.200]   sex. This is why I think the disappointment to me is that
[01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:08.920]   there isn't bipartisan recognition of this being as
[01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:12.760]   severe as a war. It is the sort of thing that the government
[01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:15.920]   that both parties need to get behind and say, let's figure out
[01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:19.040]   a path to solving this problem. This is the objective. We've got
[01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:21.520]   to get our fiscal affairs in order. And then all the other
[01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:24.560]   stuff, the social stuff, the policy stuff we can fight about
[01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:27.440]   we can argue about later. But we have to put some gas in the
[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:29.720]   tank, we have to be able to drive where we want to go. And
[01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:32.040]   we can't drive right now. Here's what I'll say to you,
[01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:37.360]   Friedberg. Since you said the beginning of the now maybe it's
[01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:40.160]   a poor choice of words. It's not the end. You said
[01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:42.080]   don't miss
[01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:44.360]   Yeah, but but don't miss
[01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:49.080]   dollar dominance in global trade. Okay, I disagree with you.
[01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:51.280]   I think dollar dominance will continue for some time.
[01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:53.440]   Jay, are you disputing that the world is becoming more
[01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:56.240]   multipolar? Do you think we're still living in unipolarity?
[01:04:56.640 --> 01:05:00.680]   No, and nor do we need to live in unipolarity for America to
[01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:03.800]   still be the champions. We still are winning at a pace that
[01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:09.560]   nobody else is. Space, energy, cars, AI, we're probably going
[01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:13.680]   to win chips. And we're going to probably win material science
[01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:16.160]   and batteries. And we're obviously going to win biotech.
[01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:19.240]   We're winning in every one of these categories. We're the
[01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:21.560]   clear winner. The only thing we're not the clear winner in is
[01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:25.000]   factories and mass producing schlocky stuff that's sold on
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.280]   Amazon. China's completely imploded. And the Middle East is
[01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:31.920]   taking their last 20 or 30 years of capital, and they're
[01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:36.680]   investing it in the West in space, energy, cars, AI, chips,
[01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:39.680]   basic materials, batteries, all the stuff that's happening here
[01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:42.240]   on our shores, we are in the most winning position we've
[01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:45.040]   probably ever been in as a country. We took a bad beat, we
[01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:47.400]   spent too much money, we got a dysfunctional government, we got
[01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:50.040]   a culture wars, we got a lot of bad stuff distracting us. But
[01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:52.480]   the truth is, when you look at brass tacks, when you look at
[01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:56.240]   innovation, we're winning on almost every dimension. We're
[01:05:56.240 --> 01:06:00.800]   just a little caught up in the fog of culture wars. And you
[01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:03.960]   know, thinking that we're going to be dominant and perfect in
[01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:06.400]   terms of our budget, we do have to fix our budget. We all agree
[01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:11.160]   on that. But we are winning. And China is currently stalled out.
[01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:14.360]   And it's because of freedom. It's because we support
[01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:19.040]   because of the basic human freedoms we have. You two guys
[01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:20.040]   are Dr. Doom.
[01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:23.000]   This is so stupid. I'm hopping off. I'm done with this. Just
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:24.320]   strike my shit out of this episode.
[01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:27.320]   Is there anything else you want to talk about today? Because I'm
[01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:28.680]   done. This is gonna be done.
[01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:31.000]   I'd love to talk about Nvidia. But I don't know if you guys
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.720]   I'm sick of being characterized as Dr. Doom. J. Cal, it's
[01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:34.440]   fucking stupid.
[01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:40.000]   We want to have a real conversation about it. Instead
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:40.240]   of your
[01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:44.800]   like, but what I said, I'm not fucking extreme. I'm not I'm
[01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:47.920]   trying to have like, an actual discipline conversation about
[01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:50.440]   where things are going. It's not black and white. It's not about
[01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:52.920]   Oh my god, the US is gonna win. Everyone's gonna lose. It's not
[01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:56.400]   a win lose situation. We cannot afford to continue to spend the
[01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:58.400]   way we're spending with our federal government. That's it. I
[01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:00.440]   agree with that. We have to solve that problem winning on
[01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:02.440]   all these other dimensions. So why are we winning? It's not the
[01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:05.920]   conversation. Why is the federal government is different from us
[01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:07.880]   innovation? There's a difference. The federal
[01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:11.760]   government, these are the voters, voters elect to tax and
[01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:15.800]   spend. And voters elect people to create a system that can
[01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:18.880]   legally go in and take assets and spend assets and borrow
[01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:22.000]   money. And we've done it in an extent now that is becoming
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:26.000]   almost a runaway train. It is a problem. We saw the negative red
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:29.040]   chart that sacks had you pull up several times that has nothing
[01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:32.960]   to do with us dominance and fucking electronics and chips
[01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:36.320]   and biotech, and all this other sort of stuff. We have a problem
[01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:38.640]   with how we spend money at the federal level. I agree with
[01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:41.720]   that. I agree. That's the conversation. I believe that the
[01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:44.320]   dominance that we have in entrepreneurship and every one of
[01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:46.680]   these categories is what will pull us out of this.
[01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:49.840]   The free enterprise system is a wonderful system that produces a
[01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:54.400]   lot of good prosperity for America. Okay, that's great. I
[01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:59.520]   agree with that. And it remains to be seen if China can sustain
[01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:02.600]   its remarkable economic growth that's had over the last few
[01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:06.600]   decades. So that remains to be seen. However, the United States
[01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:10.240]   is behaving like a late stage empire. And that is separate
[01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:14.880]   from the system that got us here. We have unsustainable
[01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:18.160]   fiscal deficits, we spend way too much money that we don't
[01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:21.480]   have. We have an uncontrolled southern border, our cities are
[01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:25.520]   in decline. We've got hundreds of 1000s of people living on the
[01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:28.680]   streets. Have you seen it? We look like a third world country.
[01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:33.120]   There's three or four crimes. That's we are we're all we're
[01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:35.880]   meddling in countries all over the world engaging in wars or
[01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:39.560]   proxy wars. We are behaving like a late stage empire. So J Cal,
[01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:42.680]   it's true that the United States has a wonderful system. And
[01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:46.600]   that's what got us here to me, it got us to unipolarity, we were
[01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:50.000]   the world's only superpower. But now we're in a world in which
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:54.360]   other countries are rising to, it's more multipolar, agreed,
[01:08:54.360 --> 01:08:58.080]   and whether we continue, our dominance will depend on whether
[01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:00.760]   we make the right decisions right now. And right now we are
[01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:03.400]   not making the right decisions. Adding 2 trillion to the debt
[01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:08.280]   in peacetime a year makes no sense. Yeah, you're a little
[01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:12.440]   ran. It's like Wile E. Coyote, going off the cliff, and
[01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:14.600]   pretending like if he just doesn't look down, there's
[01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:15.600]   nothing to worry about.
[01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:18.280]   I have said from the beginning, we need to get spending under
[01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:21.800]   control. But I am also incredibly enthusiastic about
[01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:24.400]   how we're performing in innovation and capitalism right
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:27.000]   now. It is off the charts how well this country is doing on
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.600]   those dimensions. Chamath, you have any thoughts? While we wrap
[01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:30.120]   up the same?
[01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:34.400]   No, I think we ended up conflating a bunch of issues
[01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:37.800]   into one. I'll just say what I've said before, which is that
[01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:41.560]   the United States is kind of the simplest, safest bet and that
[01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:46.040]   these decisions are made on a relative basis. China,
[01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:51.160]   unfortunately, for them have has a huge demographic problem that
[01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:55.520]   will diminish them economically. And you're already starting to
[01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:57.800]   see it, but it's going to get really exacerbated in the next
[01:09:57.800 --> 01:10:01.280]   10 or 15 years. That's just the mathematical reality for a
[01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:04.000]   country that has literally zero immigration and no solution.
[01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:10.000]   Europe is not in a very great situation. And the only place
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.600]   that's really firing on all cylinders is India. But it has a
[01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:15.000]   long way to go to build the infrastructure that can really
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:18.600]   scale and make it as predictable as United States. Could it do
[01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:21.640]   it? I think so. But it's going to take a long time that, you
[01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:25.720]   know, 50 60 100 years of investment. So I don't know, I
[01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:28.000]   just kind of like try to simplify for myself, I think the
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:32.240]   US will be fine. I think the dollar will be fine. I don't
[01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:34.080]   think it's right to spend this much. But I think that
[01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:37.040]   politicians are incapable of cutting expenses. And so I would
[01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:39.320]   like to cut their revenues. That's it.
[01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:45.440]   It's a great discussion. freeberg. Yeah, I don't think
[01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:47.560]   you are. I don't think you understand what the audience
[01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:51.120]   actually wants to hear. This is actually the core of the of the
[01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:53.560]   debate that we just had. Well, just do what Friedrich asked
[01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:56.960]   you, which is just to play his clip in his words. And then I
[01:10:56.960 --> 01:10:59.160]   have right here. I think that the Saudi China trade if this
[01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:04.040]   happens, and oil is sold in one is the beginning of I think the
[01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:06.480]   end of the assumption that the US dollar is a global reserve.
[01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:10.760]   That's all. Yeah, that's what you said. That was your
[01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:15.040]   prediction. That you said in the beginning of the end, you said
[01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:16.760]   it twice. So if you don't believe it's the beginning of
[01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:17.320]   the end, it's fine.
[01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:19.120]   The US dollar as a global reserve.
[01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:21.320]   Yes, you believe that that it's the US dollar will not be the
[01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:26.480]   global reserve. You said it twice. Yeah. And I just think
[01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:28.680]   that will be will remain the global reserve for a lifetime.
[01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:33.880]   That's a fundamental difference. Let's move on. Yes.
[01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:36.960]   I'm reticent to bring up the culture wars, but these have
[01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:39.800]   become prominent. So maybe we could have a meta discussion
[01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:44.320]   about these. There are three things going on. One, we touched
[01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:49.280]   on the book banning, I'm using air quotes there. And there's
[01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:52.160]   been a lot of feedback that's come in since then. Just to
[01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:56.720]   follow up briefly on it. Books are not exactly being banned.
[01:11:56.720 --> 01:12:00.920]   It's a much more granular and nuanced issue. There was a bill
[01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:06.960]   1467 that happened that Ron DeSantis did sign. This said
[01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:10.480]   that parents reasonably should get to see what's being put into
[01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:15.880]   classrooms. And as you might suspect, this is being done at a
[01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:18.800]   very local level. When you put all that control at the local
[01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:24.080]   level, you will have different constituents, banned books that
[01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:27.640]   maybe shouldn't be. Some of them are obvious ones that were too
[01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:31.280]   graphic that I think most parents would agree shouldn't be
[01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:35.680]   in a school library. Other ones were horror books or young adult
[01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:40.560]   books, you can look at all this stuff, just search for pen and
[01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:46.080]   books report, pen America. And if you there are instances of
[01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:48.400]   books that shouldn't be banned, being banned and instances of
[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:51.120]   books that we'd all agree on, but it is not exactly book
[01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:54.760]   banning. It's letting each of the school districts make their
[01:12:54.760 --> 01:12:56.840]   own decisions. And they're not going to make perfect decisions
[01:12:56.840 --> 01:12:58.880]   when you put them out in the edges. So just to make that
[01:12:58.880 --> 01:12:59.680]   super clear,
[01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:03.440]   I think you're right to focus on the terminology here, because
[01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:08.280]   this is a question of what is put in the school library,
[01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:12.360]   that's it. So that's not a ban. Right? A ban would be if you
[01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:15.760]   couldn't purchase the book for yourself or your kids. Any
[01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:18.600]   parent can buy any book they want in Florida. We do have an
[01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:23.480]   issue, I think, with the curriculum, where really
[01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:25.960]   important classic books are being removed from the
[01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:28.600]   curriculum for political reasons, mainly in California,
[01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:32.360]   books like to kill a mockingbird or a huck. That was weird.
[01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:34.440]   They're being removed because they're being accused of being
[01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:39.000]   racist, even though the whole point of those books is to, I
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:42.440]   think, call it out, call it out and teach kids about racism. So
[01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:45.680]   there's a lot of stupid things happening from the left in
[01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:48.080]   terms of removing books from the curriculum, which I think is a
[01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:51.200]   much bigger deal than removing books from a school library.
[01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:55.080]   There's also things happening with like, you know, Ian
[01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:59.800]   Fleming's James Bond books being rewritten, like posthumously
[01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:04.840]   because to sex, accused of sexism, or raw dolls books are
[01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:09.120]   being posthumously edited. So like books are literally being
[01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:12.000]   rewritten in a way that their authors never intended that is
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:16.080]   positively Orwellian. That really is. That's really bad.
[01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:21.120]   That's really wrong. Now on this on this this thing. I mean,
[01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:24.480]   look, this is this is getting to the level now of being a hoax.
[01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:27.680]   One of the stories going around is that there was this book of
[01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:31.000]   poetry, this totally innocuous book of poetry that was being
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:35.440]   banned in Florida. And I wanted to say, yeah, so I wanted to
[01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:38.640]   find out the truth of it. Well, as it turns out, like you said,
[01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:43.040]   J. Cal, this is in Miami Dade school district. A decision was
[01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:46.560]   made. This is not by DeSantis is made at the level of individual
[01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:47.160]   schools,
[01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:50.280]   which are voted on and their parents on the school boards. So
[01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:52.000]   it's going to just follow the demographics and whatever that
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:53.480]   local community is.
[01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:55.880]   Right. So basically, what happened is this, this book of
[01:14:55.880 --> 01:14:58.720]   poetry was literally moved from the elementary school library to
[01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:01.440]   the middle school library. That's what happened. But all of a
[01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:06.120]   sudden, this was spun on social media, and by the mainstream
[01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:09.920]   media as if DeSantis had banned this book of poetry, to the
[01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:12.920]   point where Miami Dade school district had to put out a tweet
[01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:16.800]   correcting this. So never banned or removed. It was just moved
[01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:18.400]   from one library to another.
[01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:21.240]   For me, I think this is a super interesting point, David, where
[01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:23.960]   you and I are in agreement, you and I are both for freedom of
[01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:27.560]   speech, and we're big advocates of that. And then there are
[01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:30.400]   decisions. And you could reasonably make this decision,
[01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:33.560]   hey, let the parents decide. Great. When you let the parents
[01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:36.960]   decide, you have to take into account that these school boards
[01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:39.560]   could be hijacked by different groups of people, or they could
[01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:43.560]   be very small, monocultures of, you know, little towns or
[01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:46.480]   cities. Here's the list, by the way, if anybody wants to look at
[01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:48.520]   this, you could actually look at the very granular list,
[01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:51.120]   Pan-America keeps an index of all these, I put the thing in
[01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:55.240]   the chat here, and you'll see things in left, right, everybody
[01:15:55.240 --> 01:15:58.760]   in between. Some places are banning all the LGBTQ books,
[01:15:58.760 --> 01:16:02.680]   some are banning the critical race books or books by people of
[01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:06.360]   color, other ones are banning, you know, the James Bond novels,
[01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:09.720]   etc. So it's it's a free for all of parents executing their
[01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:14.280]   rights at a very local level. And, you know, I guess if you
[01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:16.920]   want parents to have a say in their schools, it's going to be
[01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:20.720]   slightly imperfect and variable. But it's not like
[01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:24.480]   there is censorship going on, I guess, in some ways,
[01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:29.160]   the political question is, do you allow government
[01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:32.400]   bureaucrats to dictate to parents what their kids are
[01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:37.320]   going to see or have access to? And I don't think that's viable.
[01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:40.640]   I mean, look, parents could take their kids out of the school and
[01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:43.600]   homeschool them if they wanted. Yes. So at the end of the day,
[01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:47.560]   so they have that right. So why would you deny parents the right
[01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:49.960]   to determine what's in the school library?
[01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:53.520]   And it does seem like all of this goes by the way, some of
[01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:57.600]   these books that have been removed are actually Lord. Yeah,
[01:16:57.600 --> 01:16:59.720]   Lord of the Flies will probably get removed because they don't
[01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:05.040]   like somebody being labeled fat piggy. No, oh, I just lost the
[01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:07.480]   weight. Take it easy. No, no, I'm saying right. Like there are
[01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:12.400]   some great books that were written in an age where, you
[01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:14.800]   know, you just say things in a certain way that aren't meant to
[01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:17.960]   be offensive. But these books are very powerful. And I don't
[01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:20.080]   know about you guys, but I had a bunch of books that I read when
[01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:24.360]   I was younger, that had a huge impact on me. And then I don't
[01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:25.600]   want I don't want those books getting removed from the
[01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:28.800]   curriculum. You're right, Lord of the Flies, incredible,
[01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:30.840]   killer mockingbird, those are all important books that I read
[01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:33.400]   as part of the curriculum. But all we're talking about, I think
[01:17:33.400 --> 01:17:36.600]   is this even this very minor issue of what's in the library,
[01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:38.920]   obviously, the parents should get to decide. And some of the
[01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:41.120]   things that have been removed from the library are pretty out
[01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:46.080]   there. Like, for example, there was one book that was educating
[01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:50.320]   kids on like, how to get a grinder date, which they're not
[01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:52.880]   even supposed to be able to do right, like grinders for 18 and
[01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:53.200]   up.
[01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:58.160]   There are other topics that, like suicide and harm and other
[01:17:58.160 --> 01:18:00.800]   ones. When do you introduce that to a child? Is that something
[01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:03.600]   that's third grade or, you know, a suicide discussion? When
[01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:04.640]   should that reasonably occur?
[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:07.000]   This is a crazy question, but I'll ask it to you guys. I would
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:11.840]   rather Lord of the Flies be removed from a library than
[01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:14.120]   edited because then at least there's a different place where
[01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:17.280]   you can get your original book. Oh, for sure. The idea of
[01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:22.120]   editing a book is so insane. It's so mind control. Yeah, it's
[01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:25.840]   really bad. That idea is very, very bad because you're reading
[01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:30.560]   something thinking that this is what the author intended. And
[01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:33.160]   all of a sudden, it's manipulated by some rando false
[01:18:33.160 --> 01:18:37.600]   expert under some guys that you had no decision making in that's
[01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:38.400]   really bad.
[01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:42.960]   What's really I think, important of this discussion is what's how
[01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:45.560]   the press frame something how politicians frame them and then
[01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:47.920]   how they're actually executed on the ground can be very
[01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:51.840]   different. So this has become a Rorschach test for what cause
[01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:55.120]   you back. And when you actually look at just the list, you'll
[01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:58.880]   see people in California, people in Colorado banning quote
[01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:01.160]   unquote banning or just not including certain books in
[01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:04.400]   libraries. It's parents having age old debates about when do
[01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:07.240]   you introduce certain topics to your kids? That's your job as a
[01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:09.920]   parent. What happens in the library is going to be
[01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:13.640]   variable. Alright, Nvidia is going for vertical integration,
[01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:16.600]   they unveiled their GPU CPU superchip called Grace Hopper
[01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:20.000]   after the Navy Admiral, obviously, Nvidia grace, GPU
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:24.320]   uses 72 arm universe v2 CPU cores, whatever that means. The
[01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:29.440]   CPU can deliver up to 370 square on a spec crate 2017 in base,
[01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:33.400]   whatever that means. I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with all the
[01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:34.440]   benchmark.
[01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:37.800]   Is the peak of humor on the show?
[01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:40.320]   Listen, we're talking about Pentium chips. I could have
[01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:42.840]   kept up here. But I haven't kept up with this since the 90s.
[01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:45.920]   We're talking about the Intel inside Pentium chips. Yes, I
[01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:50.680]   could. I did keep up with chip stuff. I'm sure. Yeah, yeah, no,
[01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:54.520]   I mean, when we got past gigabit, I stopped. I think
[01:19:54.520 --> 01:19:58.080]   what's really interesting here is this is a really important
[01:19:58.080 --> 01:20:00.520]   moment. We're like that design that Grace Hopper design, which
[01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:05.240]   is basically a massive system on chip. It's an entire rig. It's a
[01:20:05.240 --> 01:20:08.880]   GPU and CPU and memory and interconnects. This is like them
[01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:12.240]   going for the jugular. This is what's crazy in a moment like
[01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:15.520]   this, like that is basically them trying to create an
[01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:19.760]   absolute monopoly. Because if you have these rigs, and these
[01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:23.240]   rigs are the most capable for learning, and you have their
[01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:26.880]   SDK CUDA, which is becoming the de facto software layer now that
[01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:30.120]   you use to write to their h 100s, or Grace Hopper when it's
[01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:34.600]   available, and the 100s, that could create a level of lock in
[01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:37.440]   that I think people should be thinking about. So if you're the
[01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:41.200]   hyperscalers, like Amazon and Google and Microsoft, what is
[01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:44.320]   your reaction to this? If you're Facebook, what is your reaction
[01:20:44.320 --> 01:20:48.440]   to this? And I think it's really important because if these guys
[01:20:48.440 --> 01:20:51.160]   continue to innovate at this scale, you're not going to have
[01:20:51.160 --> 01:20:54.960]   any alternatives. And it comes it goes back to like what Intel
[01:20:54.960 --> 01:20:57.960]   looked like back in the day, which is an absolute straight
[01:20:57.960 --> 01:21:01.000]   up monopoly, except the difference is that even when you
[01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:05.120]   wrote something to Intel CPUs, you could actually run it on an
[01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:11.040]   AMD processor, and it would work with no changes. But that's not
[01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:14.840]   necessarily the same. So if you go from an A 100 to something
[01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:18.800]   else, an FPGA, or some other silicon, you have to translate
[01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:21.680]   the model. And so it's very important to understand that
[01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:24.560]   there's no extensibility here. So like if Nvidia continues to
[01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:28.480]   drive this quickly and, and continues to execute like this,
[01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:33.240]   it's a one and done one company monopoly in AI at the hardware
[01:21:33.240 --> 01:21:35.920]   layer. And I think that that people are probably thinking
[01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:40.840]   about how to blunt that competitive outcome. But that's
[01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:43.840]   what I took away from that, from that announcement from them,
[01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:46.880]   which is like, they are ready to go for the juggler here in what
[01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:50.520]   looks like the most important market that's emerged in like
[01:21:50.520 --> 01:21:53.640]   what do you think about the valuation to math trading at 200
[01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:54.760]   times or 50 times?
[01:21:54.760 --> 01:21:57.920]   I'm in your camp. The simple thing about price to equity
[01:21:57.920 --> 01:22:00.800]   ratios is if you take the price equity ratio, and you invert it,
[01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:04.520]   that's your implied earnings price earnings, price earnings,
[01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:09.640]   or and you invert it, that's your yield, right. And so Nvidia
[01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:13.640]   is yielding at these prices, I think it's somewhere like two to
[01:22:13.640 --> 01:22:17.640]   two and a half percent, which is less than and it's almost half
[01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:22.040]   of a typical two year bond. And so when you have a yield that
[01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:25.680]   that's low, you have to see it just grow absolutely massively.
[01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:29.840]   But there's this principle in capitalism, which is in order to
[01:22:29.840 --> 01:22:33.880]   grow like that, you're generating so much profit, that
[01:22:33.880 --> 01:22:36.440]   competitors look at it and say, Hold on, you don't deserve that
[01:22:36.440 --> 01:22:37.960]   much profit, I'm going to take some of that.
[01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:40.560]   Your profits, my opportunity, your margins, my opportunity.
[01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:43.760]   I think that your margin is my opportunity is exactly what
[01:22:43.760 --> 01:22:46.840]   happens. So I think what I'm waiting for freeberg is like in
[01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:51.880]   the next two quarters, if AMD, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and
[01:22:51.880 --> 01:22:57.040]   Amazon don't announce something substantive, there's a very good
[01:22:57.040 --> 01:23:00.720]   chance that Nvidia runs away with this. And I think that
[01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:05.080]   that's very problematic. But in that case, that price is cheap.
[01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:09.280]   My bet, though, it's a different version of your bet, but we get
[01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:11.320]   to the same outcome is that I don't think that that's going to
[01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:14.440]   happen, because it's just too important. And so I think that
[01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:18.880]   everybody other than Nvidia wants vendor diversity, right,
[01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:22.520]   you don't want to get locked into one person, or one set of
[01:23:22.520 --> 01:23:25.960]   hardware, or one cloud, you know, one SDK, you don't want
[01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:29.520]   that nobody wants that, except Nvidia, and Nvidia shareholders.
[01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:32.760]   So my bet is in the next two quarters, you start to see some
[01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:36.520]   real action so that folks start to have to balance their
[01:23:36.520 --> 01:23:40.400]   forecasts, where it's not just 100% Nvidia, but it's Nvidia
[01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:45.760]   plus plus plus. And that's sort of what I would bet. Because it
[01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:49.480]   just seems like logical and right, because I, otherwise it
[01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:52.360]   would it would be pretty derelict of these hyperscalers
[01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:54.680]   to just throw their hands in the air and just give the whole
[01:23:54.680 --> 01:23:57.360]   market to them. And it would be derelict of AMD. The other thing
[01:23:57.360 --> 01:24:00.480]   that's happening is, and you know, AMD is AMD is a great
[01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:03.760]   memory solution. But they really don't have a deterministic AI
[01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:06.920]   chip. And I think that Lisa Sue needs to get needs to act
[01:24:06.920 --> 01:24:10.280]   decisively here and build something announced something by
[01:24:10.280 --> 01:24:12.960]   something, but she needs to be really aggressive here.
[01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:17.880]   If you look at the language models, a lot of them are taking
[01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:22.040]   less and less CPU GPU to actually build them. So this has
[01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:26.480]   been like a bit of a race or competition on hugging face. I
[01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:28.480]   showed the leaderboard on another episode, maybe two
[01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:30.280]   episodes ago, but I've been talking to some of the people
[01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:32.400]   who are doing these language models to math and they said
[01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:36.040]   there's massive inefficiency. And so yeah, and by the way, the
[01:24:36.040 --> 01:24:39.080]   other thing I mentioned, J kal is also happening, which is like
[01:24:39.080 --> 01:24:42.120]   the freeberg you talked about this atomization of these models
[01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:45.480]   is happening, I think even faster than when you first
[01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:46.080]   brought that up.
[01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:49.960]   Yeah, so what took two or $3 million last year is now taking
[01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:52.800]   $200,000 just through software improvements and code
[01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:57.320]   improvements, crazy. And now they're thinking a number of the
[01:24:57.320 --> 01:24:59.960]   other thing people are coming to is because of so much what's the
[01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:01.840]   term hallucinations that people are using because of the
[01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:04.760]   hallucinations, people are making narrower models that are
[01:25:04.760 --> 01:25:08.800]   deeper in legal or just, you know, stack overflow, just core
[01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:12.160]   or just a vertical and core. They take less GPU, but they get
[01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:15.480]   better results because you've constrained the data set. And
[01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:19.400]   that's resulting in, you know, better outcomes. So I think this
[01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:23.280]   could also be where maybe people don't need as much GPU or CPU at
[01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:25.320]   the same time, so many people are going after it. So that
[01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:29.440]   could flip where the demand could actually decrease because
[01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:32.160]   of software efficiencies or hitting some benchmark that's
[01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:35.200]   reasonable enough. What do you think? freeberg?
[01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:39.480]   Look, I think as performance improves, as cost declines,
[01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:42.880]   like any economic model, there's a pretty nonlinear relationship
[01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:48.080]   with demand. So we'll find new ways to apply this technology. I
[01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:49.880]   think the demand is only going to go nonlinear.
[01:25:49.880 --> 01:25:54.600]   Having this happening is people are starting to build like
[01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:59.480]   mosaic ml. They're building cloud independent models. So you
[01:25:59.480 --> 01:26:02.720]   can take the same model build it on your own proprietary personal
[01:26:02.720 --> 01:26:06.440]   cloud, not educate chat GPT for not educate barred, but do it
[01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:10.520]   with your own model. And then you can move it from
[01:26:10.520 --> 01:26:15.800]   reduction and fine tuning seems to like, get to the point that
[01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:21.840]   we can run these things on small machines, cheaply, quickly. And
[01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:25.640]   it just, it'll change the it'll change the applications.
[01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:28.640]   You're saying run inference cheaper, not run training,
[01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:30.640]   run inference. That's right.
[01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:35.800]   No, this is not good. Biden just had a big fall on stage at the
[01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:37.720]   US Air Force Academy graduation.
[01:26:37.720 --> 01:26:42.080]   Oh, no. I think he'll be okay. But whoa, it's not like he fell
[01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:46.000]   off the stage. He just tried. Oh, it doesn't doesn't look good.
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.040]   But he could have broke something. Well, hope he's okay.
[01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:51.000]   I hope he's okay. Yeah. I mean, we just had this whole talk
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.280]   about it. Yeah. I mean, it's just again, I think like physical
[01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:56.360]   like these kinds of physical things are, are normal. And I
[01:26:56.360 --> 01:26:58.520]   think people need to be much more empathetic about that kind
[01:26:58.520 --> 01:27:01.080]   of stuff. I mean, he was riding a bike over the summer last year.
[01:27:01.080 --> 01:27:03.200]   I remember. And you look great.
[01:27:03.200 --> 01:27:08.160]   FDR was in a wheelchair. So I don't care about that. All I
[01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:11.680]   care about is mental acuity. Yeah, me too. Okay. By the way,
[01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:15.600]   I want him to be well enough to run because I'm scared of some
[01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:18.000]   of the other democratic candidates they might put up
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:22.720]   same. Like, I don't want to get a president of Newsom. Or
[01:27:22.720 --> 01:27:26.200]   President Harris. I mean, I don't think Biden is very good.
[01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:28.520]   But I think he's better than Harris or Newsom.
[01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:31.400]   Biden drops out who's the lead candidate in your mind?
[01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:32.360]   Okay.
[01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:34.520]   Really? Wow.
[01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:37.760]   I would prefer RFK to Biden. But I think what will happen if
[01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:40.680]   Biden drops out is we'll get a flood of establishment
[01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:44.640]   democrat candidates in the race. Newsom, maybe JB Pritzker,
[01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:45.800]   Harris, for sure.
[01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:48.200]   There's a lot of differences between the left and the right.
[01:27:48.200 --> 01:27:50.520]   But the one similarity is that there's a large amount of
[01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:54.600]   voters in both of those blocks who don't fundamentally like
[01:27:54.600 --> 01:27:58.760]   these establishment candidates. And I think that that sentiment
[01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:01.320]   is exactly the same. And so you know, you can have a pro Trump
[01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:04.360]   wave on the right, just like you could have a pro RFK wave on the
[01:28:04.360 --> 01:28:08.920]   left. And they are solidified by the same idea, which is, I think
[01:28:08.920 --> 01:28:11.800]   you're going to see more and more outsiders have a chance
[01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:13.640]   through the nomination process to get in.
[01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:17.160]   I think the Democratic Party will stop it. I mean, they
[01:28:17.160 --> 01:28:20.720]   should Bernie Sanders. Remember that? It was Sanders against
[01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:26.560]   Clinton. And they, they shipped him. They rigged the primary
[01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:30.120]   against him. Let's use that word. Oh,
[01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:33.800]   labeled are just labeled the episode.
[01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:39.160]   No, but look, I mean, the the establishment has in the
[01:28:39.160 --> 01:28:42.040]   Democratic Party has a huge influence over the outcome
[01:28:42.040 --> 01:28:44.480]   because they control the superdelegates, right? They'll
[01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:44.920]   never
[01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:48.360]   wouldn't do some supercharged the Republican base. I mean,
[01:28:48.360 --> 01:28:51.680]   being like a coastal elite. And what's happened with San
[01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:54.280]   Francisco and LA, I think that just drives out the Trump
[01:28:54.280 --> 01:28:55.560]   voters in a massive way that
[01:28:55.560 --> 01:28:58.640]   I said, like over a year ago, I thought that the wow, that
[01:28:58.640 --> 01:29:02.520]   2024 would be a Newsome to Santa's race. I still think
[01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:04.520]   there's like a 10 20% chance of that.
[01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:08.280]   Wow, that would be wild. Be wild.
[01:29:08.280 --> 01:29:09.200]   Maybe 10%.
[01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:12.840]   What about Joe Manchin? What's the story there? Anybody have
[01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:14.080]   any insights on Joe Manchin?
[01:29:14.080 --> 01:29:18.120]   We had a phenomenal dinner at my house last week. He is so
[01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:21.200]   wait, charming. Okay, so what do you know this? What are you
[01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:22.880]   talking about? I don't know if you publicly disclosed it.
[01:29:23.800 --> 01:29:27.880]   Well, it's already happened. We had a we had a fabulous dinner.
[01:29:27.880 --> 01:29:31.760]   And he met a lot of people here. And he's amazing.
[01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:35.360]   Did sacks come to that? And Heather, and Heather's amazing.
[01:29:35.360 --> 01:29:39.280]   Heather's amazing to his daughter, who she ran, I think
[01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:42.080]   was my land pharmaceutical, incredible executive.
[01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:45.920]   Joe Manchin would jump in. Yeah. You think trauma matches
[01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:48.520]   fabulous. If Biden wasn't in Joe Manchin would jump in. You
[01:29:48.520 --> 01:29:51.840]   think? I don't know. I don't want to speculate any on
[01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:54.120]   anything like that. But I think he's I think he's an amazing
[01:29:54.120 --> 01:29:55.320]   American patriot.
[01:29:55.320 --> 01:29:58.480]   Is that your guy? freeberg? Would you go Joe Manchin?
[01:29:58.480 --> 01:30:00.040]   Because he wants to control spending?
[01:30:00.040 --> 01:30:03.080]   I don't know. I don't know.
[01:30:03.080 --> 01:30:08.360]   I'll tell you one of the reasons why I like RFK Jr. Is that
[01:30:08.360 --> 01:30:11.280]   there's so many issues that he is deviating from Democratic
[01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:14.120]   Party orthodoxies in favor of free speech, and against
[01:30:14.120 --> 01:30:17.200]   censorship. He's in favor of civil liberties and against
[01:30:17.200 --> 01:30:20.560]   this, like massive surveillance state that we've created. And
[01:30:20.560 --> 01:30:23.560]   on foreign policy wants to end all the crazy wars. And I would
[01:30:23.560 --> 01:30:26.920]   say that of all the candidates I've heard, he understands the
[01:30:26.920 --> 01:30:31.600]   situation in Ukraine the most deeply. Now, both Trump and
[01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:35.280]   dissenters have called for a ceasefire. And that's good. And
[01:30:35.280 --> 01:30:39.760]   I think RFK would work towards a ceasefire to the RFK Jr. goes
[01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:43.560]   deeper and explains how the whole situation Ukraine came
[01:30:43.560 --> 01:30:46.520]   about. And so he understands it very deeply.
[01:30:46.520 --> 01:30:49.440]   All right, folks, they have it. Another episode of the online
[01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:56.040]   podcast for the dictator, the architect David Sachs. And I
[01:30:56.040 --> 01:30:57.440]   will call him Kingmaker. No, he's
[01:30:57.440 --> 01:31:00.520]   I'm sorry. Kingmaker. I like architect. Okay, Kingmaker. Sure.
[01:31:00.520 --> 01:31:01.120]   Kingmaker.
[01:31:01.120 --> 01:31:02.880]   News.
[01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:06.400]   You like architect or King? It's crazy. The whole thing was
[01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:08.760]   just like made up. But I know but as a nickname, which one
[01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:10.720]   does your name? What do you prefer? architect? Do you
[01:31:10.720 --> 01:31:14.440]   prefer? Okay, what are the articles say? Kingmaker?
[01:31:14.440 --> 01:31:16.920]   articles of Kingmaker I said architect. I think architect is
[01:31:16.920 --> 01:31:20.400]   more Svengali ish. The articles about a call that never happened
[01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:23.040]   sickness with a person you don't know with a person I don't know.
[01:31:23.040 --> 01:31:28.840]   Right? Okay, that aside, what? What nickname would you like us
[01:31:28.840 --> 01:31:30.480]   to use going forward? Kingmaker?
[01:31:30.480 --> 01:31:33.000]   The whole article was made up.
[01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.680]   Yes. Putting that aside, architect. Can I go with
[01:31:35.680 --> 01:31:37.640]   Kingmaker? I like Kingmaker. I like architect.
[01:31:37.640 --> 01:31:39.680]   But it's silly.
[01:31:39.680 --> 01:31:42.840]   Mr. Secretary, please tell us which one. Yeah. Secretary of
[01:31:42.840 --> 01:31:48.120]   State. Look, I'm I'm a I'm a mid level donor. Mid at best. You're
[01:31:48.120 --> 01:31:49.200]   mad. Mid.
[01:31:49.200 --> 01:31:52.000]   Reddit subreddits are going crazy right now.
[01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:57.640]   And then influencer I'm mid at best. So I'm a secretary of
[01:31:57.640 --> 01:32:01.800]   state. I'm mid mid. However, there it's true that there are
[01:32:01.800 --> 01:32:03.840]   very few podcasters you probably donate anything.
[01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:07.200]   You could be Yeah. Henry Kissinger and Madeline Albright.
[01:32:07.200 --> 01:32:09.960]   highest ranking foreign born citizens to lead.
[01:32:09.960 --> 01:32:12.640]   Yes, I think that you would be an exceptional Secretary of
[01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:15.160]   State. I'm just gonna put that you could be Secretary of State
[01:32:15.160 --> 01:32:18.880]   cabinet. I think you would kick ass. Because you have the
[01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:21.720]   intellectual firepower to actually not get bamboozled on
[01:32:21.720 --> 01:32:22.760]   this stuff. You'd hold your ground.
[01:32:22.760 --> 01:32:25.680]   You know, actually, I think was pretty good on on foreign
[01:32:25.680 --> 01:32:29.840]   policy doesn't get any credit was was Jared Kushner. I was
[01:32:29.840 --> 01:32:33.760]   listening to an interview with him. And this happened like
[01:32:33.760 --> 01:32:36.080]   eight months ago. And he was describing the whole situation
[01:32:36.080 --> 01:32:40.480]   in Ukraine. And he says very clearly, that he and Trump
[01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:44.000]   understood that bringing Ukraine into NATO was a red line for the
[01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:47.640]   Russians, and they never went there. So they armed Ukraine,
[01:32:47.640 --> 01:32:51.560]   but they were very careful to not make any statements about
[01:32:51.560 --> 01:32:54.280]   Ukraine coming into NATO. He understood that that was a
[01:32:54.280 --> 01:32:58.480]   serious provocation. I'll post the interview in the chat. But
[01:32:58.480 --> 01:33:02.440]   it was with I think Gerard Baker for the Wall Street Journal. So
[01:33:02.440 --> 01:33:06.200]   Jared understood the situation better than most of these, you
[01:33:06.200 --> 01:33:10.320]   know, foreign policy elite establishment types who don't
[01:33:10.320 --> 01:33:13.760]   understand how their actions can be perceived as provocative by
[01:33:13.760 --> 01:33:14.560]   the other side.
[01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:18.360]   Well, he, he sure secured the bag after getting out of that
[01:33:18.360 --> 01:33:19.720]   gig. 2 billion.
[01:33:19.720 --> 01:33:24.520]   And he got the Abraham Accords done. And now, binds his flush
[01:33:24.520 --> 01:33:26.880]   out down the toilet because he's alienated the Saudis so much
[01:33:26.880 --> 01:33:29.000]   they've gone to the Chinese.
[01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.840]   I mean, the fact that there's flights between Israel and the
[01:33:31.840 --> 01:33:36.520]   Middle East nations now and they seem to have a common. It's
[01:33:36.520 --> 01:33:36.960]   pretty awesome.
[01:33:36.960 --> 01:33:37.480]   Me in
[01:33:37.840 --> 01:33:40.560]   I don't think you understand how much Biden has alienated the
[01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:45.480]   Saudis. Shake, bind, wouldn't shake the man's hand. What was
[01:33:45.480 --> 01:33:46.280]   the point of that?
[01:33:46.280 --> 01:33:48.240]   I'm not in favor of
[01:33:48.240 --> 01:33:52.120]   buying. What was that like a fist bumpers? pre negotiated
[01:33:52.120 --> 01:33:53.400]   fist bump? Yeah, it's a little
[01:33:53.400 --> 01:33:54.840]   how insulting is that
[01:33:54.840 --> 01:33:57.160]   the one thing I loved about Trump was he was willing to meet
[01:33:57.160 --> 01:34:00.160]   with anybody. My idea of foreign policy is meet with as many
[01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:04.160]   people as possible, as often as possible, and not go to war, I
[01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:08.240]   would meet with Kim Jong Un, Putin, Xi Jinping on the
[01:34:08.240 --> 01:34:11.080]   regular, every country we should be with, because that's how
[01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:15.160]   progress gets me not meeting with him is, yeah, I mean, it's
[01:34:15.160 --> 01:34:20.680]   not a reward. I think there's a part of this military industrial
[01:34:20.680 --> 01:34:24.320]   complex that believes a meeting with the President is a reward
[01:34:24.320 --> 01:34:28.120]   or an endorsement of the worst things anybody's ever done. It's
[01:34:28.120 --> 01:34:32.120]   not, it's a meeting to try to make the world safer, or to try
[01:34:32.120 --> 01:34:35.480]   to build common ground. And so that is not me or Jim Cramer,
[01:34:35.480 --> 01:34:40.520]   however, you want to try to frame it. It's intelligent. And
[01:34:40.520 --> 01:34:42.800]   I'm for intelligent foreign policy, which is talking to
[01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:46.440]   people. Let's talk about some people who said yes to come to
[01:34:46.440 --> 01:34:50.520]   all in summit. Let's just do a quick speaker. I gotta go. I
[01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:53.120]   love you guys. I love you. Yeah, fuck this. I'm done with this
[01:34:53.120 --> 01:34:55.520]   shit. Freeberg. I love you.
[01:34:55.520 --> 01:35:03.920]   Thank you. See you tonight. Total Sip Lord. Rain Man David
[01:35:03.920 --> 01:35:09.720]   Satterthwaite. And it said we open source it to the fans and
[01:35:09.720 --> 01:35:13.560]   they've just gone crazy with it. Love you. I'm Queen of quinoa.
[01:35:13.560 --> 01:35:14.680]   Going on.
[01:35:14.680 --> 01:35:20.880]   Besties are
[01:35:20.880 --> 01:35:24.920]   dog taking a notice your driveway.
[01:35:24.920 --> 01:35:33.280]   We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy
[01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:36.120]   because they're all just like this like sexual tension that
[01:35:36.120 --> 01:35:37.400]   they just need to release somehow.
[01:35:38.560 --> 01:35:42.160]   What you're about to be
[01:35:42.520 --> 01:35:45.480]   what we need to get mercy is our
[01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:46.600]   dog.
[01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:47.680]   Oh, man.
[01:35:48.640 --> 01:35:49.280]   Oh, man.
[01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:51.080]   Oh, man.
[01:35:51.320 --> 01:35:51.920]   Oh, man.
[01:35:52.920 --> 01:35:54.600]   I'm going on.
