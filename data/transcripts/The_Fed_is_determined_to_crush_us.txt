[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.840]   Hello, everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai.
[00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:08.040]   And in this episode, I want to talk about the latest Fed rate hike and what they said.
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.480]   Because unfortunately, I think hope is slowly seeping out of the balloon here.
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.900]   Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who is also worth more than $100 million, has basically
[00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:25.320]   raised interest rates by another 50 basis points to 4.25 to 4.5%.
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:32.760]   And more importantly, he telegraphed the Fed is looking at a terminal rate of 5.125%.
[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:40.020]   So 17 out of the 19 governors, something like that, have agreed that 5.125% for the terminal
[00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.680]   rate, the end rate is where they're going.
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.800]   And that's a shocker because originally, the terminal rate was 5%.
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.660]   And much of the investment community hope the Fed would stop before 5%.
[00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:03.120]   So now for them to raise the terminal rate by 0.125% to 5.125%, despite October and November
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:10.760]   CPI numbers coming in below expectations, the only conclusion we can make is the Fed
[00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.840]   is okay with a recession.
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.940]   The Fed wants a recession to bring down inflation, which is already coming down quite rapidly.
[00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:26.840]   At this rate, you know, 0.1% month over month, by the summer of 2023, there is no doubt inflation
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.720]   will be below 5%.
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.400]   And it'll probably be closer to 3% at this rate.
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:38.320]   And I bet sometime in 2023, we're going to talk more about deflation rather than inflation.
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.840]   So I think with a 90% certainty, we should all be thinking this way.
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.500]   There's going to be another recession in 2023.
[00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.120]   And this is a self induced recession.
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:57.240]   I used to think with 85% certainty that 3577 on the S&P 500 was the bottom, but now the
[00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.800]   Fed is targeting a 5.125% terminal Fed funds rate.
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:09.700]   If we get to 5% or above, I think we're definitely going below 3577 on the S&P 500.
[00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:16.700]   So please be aware, you heard about the 2023 Wall Street S&P 500 forecast, the median is
[00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.000]   something like 4000 highs of around 4500.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.800]   Some some actually new forecasts are at 5000.
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:29.480]   And then the lows are at around 3000 is looking more and more likely that getting back to
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:36.760]   4000 in 2023, if the Fed funds rate goes to 5.125% is more and more unlikely.
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.920]   So mentally, you should think about investing in stocks as completely dead money in the
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:42.920]   next year.
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.300]   Now, let's look at the bright side.
[00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.920]   The bright side is right now in 2022, end of 2022.
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.040]   We know with high certainty that over the next 18 months, doom is coming doom as in
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.360]   another global recession, probably going to be a little bit worse than the 2022 recession,
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.840]   first quarter, second quarter GDP consecutive declines, because a lot of jobs are going
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.960]   to be lost in 2023.
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.360]   We're starting to see the cuts, but more and more are going to be lost in 2023.
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.620]   So if you lose your job, it's a depression, right?
[00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.840]   If you don't lose your job, but you lose money in the stock market, real estate, and so far,
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.480]   that's a recession.
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.480]   So where's the upside?
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.080]   Well, the upside is that we know doom is coming.
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.340]   Whereas in 2007, things were really hunky dory, and it was just boom times.
[00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.600]   And then we got side swiped in 2008 and 2009.
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:35.820]   Everybody was caught off guard.
[00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.760]   So when we know that doom is coming over the next 18 months, we can do things to prepare
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:41.760]   right?
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.260]   We can behave aggressively, we can buy short term treasury bonds yielding over 4%.
[00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.560]   We can asset allocate properly, we can reach out to our bosses and colleagues that matter
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.420]   so we don't get laid off.
[00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.160]   We can build side hustles and work on our side businesses.
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:03.620]   We can do so many things over the next 12 to 18 months that we become a solidified economic
[00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:09.240]   fortress that withstands the economic crush that comes our way.
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:13.340]   So when that crush comes, we will be able to outperform.
[00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.020]   Now let's say the crush, the economic crush doesn't come, and the Fed governors grow a
[00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:22.860]   conscience and they stop caring about their legacy of combating inflation, which is already
[00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:29.300]   coming down, and they start caring more about the middle class, and not crushing and eliminating
[00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.660]   a million plus jobs and hurting people's livelihoods.
[00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:33.660]   Let's say that happens.
[00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:39.320]   And let's say they don't get to 5% or 5.125% on the terminal rate.
[00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:44.000]   Well, in that scenario, risk assets will start doing well again.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.720]   And with you and your preparation, you're going to outperform again.
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.760]   So really, it's a win-win scenario.
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.960]   You're going to outperform on the downside, and you're going to outperform on the upside.
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:05:00.020]   So key lesson here is to really start baking in dark sky scenarios so you can pre-mortem
[00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.680]   plan well before these things happen.
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.720]   And if these things don't happen, you're going to be winning all the same.
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.440]   There's one last thing I want to leave you with as I sit in my car and contemplate the
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.000]   future.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.160]   And that is, I don't think any of us have to worry about ourselves.
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.960]   We don't have to worry about you and me listening to this podcast, anybody who is paying attention
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:27.800]   to their finances, saving aggressively, allocating properly, and doing the right things.
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.440]   What we have to worry about are those who don't do the right things, who just wing it,
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:37.040]   who are going crazy and investing in things that they shouldn't be because they think
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.000]   they're going to win a lottery ticket.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.960]   A good example of this was back in 2008 and 2009 when a lot of condo owners and homeowners
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.520]   did short sales because they were underwater on their mortgage.
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:54.360]   They bought homes that they couldn't afford with tiny down payments, and their interest
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.840]   rates went up, and they just couldn't afford it.
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:01.080]   And so they got crushed, but unfortunately, everybody else who just kept on paying their
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:06.440]   mortgages because they could afford it, or who didn't have any mortgages, also got hurt
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:12.520]   because the marginal actors brought down the majority of people who just did what they
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.080]   were supposed to do.
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.320]   So what's the solution?
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:20.520]   Well, the solution is to mentally prepare for this to happen, to have your net worth
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.080]   get hurt by marginal actors.
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:28.720]   But given your finances are solid, and you can wait things out and not get hurt as bad,
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:34.800]   your next step is to take advantage of the decline in asset prices and buy those assets
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.340]   from those marginal actors.
[00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.160]   And here's what will likely happen over time.
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.600]   Let's say you do a short sale, you go bankrupt.
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:47.300]   Well, your credit score is ruined for seven years, maybe longer, and you're not able to
[00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.640]   get credit to buy anything else.
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:56.300]   However, you as the good actor, go ahead and take advantage and buy those assets on sale.
[00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:01.000]   And over the course of seven to 10 years, these assets will likely rebound in value,
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.160]   stocks, real estate, and so forth.
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:07.400]   However, if you're the marginal actor who couldn't get credit over seven, 10 years,
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.040]   you weren't able to take advantage.
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.320]   In fact, you lost money because you sold at the low.
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:15.800]   And then when you're trying to get back in seven to 10 years, when you can actually get
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:22.260]   credit, asset prices are much higher, and you permanently maybe get shut out.
[00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:26.400]   And if you get shut out, then your children will likely get shut out.
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:31.400]   And then this is why there's this growing dichotomy between the knowledge folks, the
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:35.420]   people who care, the wealthy folks, and the people who are just winging it and not bothering
[00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:36.420]   to care.
[00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:38.200]   So please care about your finances.
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.720]   If you can hold on, hold on for better days ahead.
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:47.760]   Personally, I'm taking it down a notch in 2023, because the return on effort is not
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:48.760]   there.
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.740]   It's not as high during the bull market.
[00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:52.680]   So why bother?
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:53.960]   Don't fight the Fed, folks.
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:08:01.640]   We've given one man enough power to ruin economies and to grow economies, to kill jobs and to
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:02.640]   grow jobs.
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:03.780]   It's unbelievable, actually.
[00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:06.520]   We give one man all that power.
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:09.920]   But who are we to step in the way of one powerful man?
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:10.960]   We should get out of the way.
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:15.280]   If the Fed wants to hurt the economy, I guess we got to let them.
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:18.520]   And we got to let capitalism work itself out.
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:21.940]   And for those who aren't prepared, they're going to suffer.
[00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:25.040]   But that gives opportunity for those who are prepared.
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:29.840]   If you want to better prepare, I suggest you pick up a copy of Buy This, Not That, my Wall
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:34.960]   Street Journal bestselling book at FinancialSamurai.com/btnt.
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:40.640]   And please sign up for my free weekly newsletter, FinancialSamurai.com/news.
[00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:45.800]   I'm actually really excited today, because it's my daughter's third birthday.
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:48.800]   And boy, three years have flown by.
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:54.420]   I still remember writing the post, "Why I Failed at Early Retirement," a love story.
[00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:58.160]   And it was when my daughter was born in December 2019.
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:03.920]   And it's interesting, once you become a parent, you do everything possible to get your finances
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:10.120]   right, do the right thing, stay in shape, and ensure that you can provide for your family.
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.920]   So that's one of the interesting things about parenthood.
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:16.760]   And I'm on this journey, and I'd love to hear from all of you parents as well, on how you
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:21.800]   have better focused on staying healthy, fit, and getting your finances right.
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:26.680]   Because this is clearly evolution that I'm experiencing and witnessing.
[00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:31.080]   And I'd love to listen to your stories and learn from all of you as well.
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:32.080]   So leave a comment.
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.080]   Don't be shy.
