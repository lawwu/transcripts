[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:36.120]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.800]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.560]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:50.680]   Today I'm going to talk to you about the lifestyles of the frugal and obscure.
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.760]   It sounds exciting, doesn't it?
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.160]   Lifestyles of the frugal and obscure.
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.920]   You know, they could make a TV show out of such a concept.
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.000]   In fact, I have seen some various videos of people who do enjoy showing off their frugality.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.680]   Unfortunately, if one were to make a TV show about the lifestyles of the frugal and obscure,
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.840]   it would violate the second point of obscurity.
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.060]   You could make a TV show on the lifestyles of the frugal, but you couldn't really make
[00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.800]   a TV show on the lifestyles of the obscure.
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.580]   And yet I want you to consider this concept as a valuable outline for you to implement
[00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.040]   in your own life to help you become wealthy and stay wealthy.
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.200]   Let me give you the two-sentence summary of my thesis in today's show.
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:43.640]   Frugality is a pathway for you to become wealthy, and obscurity is a pathway for you to remain
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.120]   wealthy.
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.120]   These two concepts are important.
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.520]   There are different phases of wealth accumulation.
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.680]   You have to figure out how to create an income stream, and then you have to figure out how
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.480]   to turn that income stream into valuable investments.
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.680]   That's wealth accumulation, the wealth accumulation phase.
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.480]   And then after you've accumulated substantial or sufficient wealth, then you have to figure
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.960]   out how to preserve that wealth.
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.600]   That's the wealth preservation phase.
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.360]   This is where we talk about good investment planning, good asset protection planning,
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.680]   everything associated with wealth preservation.
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.920]   And then we move on to the wealth distribution phase, and that wealth distribution phase
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.920]   might include things like retirement distribution strategies.
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.720]   It might include things like estate planning.
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.320]   How do we avoid excessive taxation or excessive cost in distributing our estate to our heirs
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.640]   and descendants or other causes that we wish to support?
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.080]   And so wealth goes through these different phases.
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:42.240]   But in the early phases especially, frugality forms the cornerstone of your wealth building.
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.840]   Frugality is not optional.
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.680]   You must be frugal in order to become wealthy.
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.400]   Let me explain why.
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:57.160]   No matter how much you earn, if you are not frugal, you won't have any money available
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.000]   for you to invest.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.640]   Thus, frugality is not optional.
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:08.040]   Now notice that frugality is a subjective word rather than an objective word.
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.960]   When I use the term frugality, you should immediately think about frugality in terms
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.360]   of scale.
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.000]   What is frugal for one person may not be frugal for another person.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   To give you an example, purchasing for somebody who is an aspirational spender, they want
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.560]   to spend at a high lifestyle.
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:33.320]   For that person, purchasing a $5 million home may not be a frugal expense.
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.600]   If that person doesn't have significant wealth, if they don't have large amounts
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.880]   of assets that are throwing off investment income for them, if they don't have a very
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:46.440]   high income, that $5 million home may be one of the most expensive and costly things they
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.440]   do.
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.600]   That is not at all frugal.
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:55.280]   But if you look at another person, for another person, owning a $5 million home may be an
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:01.300]   extremely frugal purchase, even though it doesn't look objectively like an inexpensive
[00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.240]   frugal home.
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:08.660]   In my experience, it's not uncommon to find young working couples that have a household
[00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:13.240]   income of perhaps $75, $80, $100,000.
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:19.560]   It's not uncommon to find young couples like this spending $200, $250,000 to $300,000 purchasing
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.440]   a home, at least where I'm from here in South Florida.
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.120]   That's just not unusual.
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.200]   This is not uncommon.
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.120]   But if you think about what that means in terms of wealth, then for that person, let's
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:37.800]   say that they're earning $80,000 per year and they are spending $300,000 on a home,
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:44.080]   they are spending what is equivalent to almost four years of income purchasing a house.
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.200]   And it's also not uncommon when people are purchasing this kind of house for them not
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.360]   to have any real significant savings.
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.680]   They may be enrolled in a 401k plan at work and have $10,000 or $15,000.
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.960]   They may have saved up a small down payment, but perhaps this is an FHA loan where they
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.320]   only had to come up with a 3% down payment.
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.460]   So maybe they're putting down $10,000, something along that range.
[00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:13.960]   So for this person, purchasing this $300,000 home is a fairly expensive thing when compared
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.680]   to their income and to their assets.
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.520]   Now let's turn it around.
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:23.320]   Let's say that somebody has a net worth of $20 million and they've accumulated this net
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:28.040]   worth over a course of years through business or through their own personal investments.
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.280]   And with this net worth of $20 million, let's just use a very simple, very conservative
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.280]   idea of the 4% rule.
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:40.760]   The 4% rule, meaning that this is producing $800,000, their $20 million portfolio is producing
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.920]   $800,000 of income.
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:47.640]   That would be extraordinarily conservative for such a significant portfolio.
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.560]   But this person has an $800,000 income.
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:58.240]   Now for them to go and to spend four years of their earnings, of their income on a house,
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:03.800]   that would put them in a price range of $3,200,000 of buying a house.
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:09.080]   So let me adjust it to, so we've got $20 million.
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:14.760]   Let's take 4% of that, $800,000, and let's make it the same 3.75 years of income.
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:20.120]   3.75 years of income puts them at a $3 million house.
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.920]   So this person could take and go and spend, buy a $3 million house.
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:31.680]   But if you think about their net worth calculation, they still have $20 million set aside in investments.
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:37.700]   And so even though they might buy a $3 million house, which is equivalent in income to the
[00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:42.400]   working couple, it's actually an extremely frugal decision for them.
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:46.800]   This is why it's so important to be frugal, but to apply frugality, apply the lens of
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.780]   scale to all of your frugal decisions.
[00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:56.120]   But no matter your current income, no matter your current wealth, you must be frugal.
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.840]   If you are not frugal, you will lose your wealth.
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:04.640]   I repeat, if you are not frugal, you will lose your wealth.
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:10.960]   We can point to example after example after example, most prominently from the world of
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:16.480]   entertainment, from the world of large professional sports, from these types of people who come
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:20.160]   into huge amounts of money, but then they quickly inflate their lifestyle.
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:24.240]   And it's not uncommon to find these people who are quickly bankrupt.
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:27.880]   Now thankfully, usually if they've built up some kind of name recognition, they can
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:32.360]   amend their ways and earn huge amounts of money again to rebuild their wealth.
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.160]   But the lack of frugality will destroy their wealth.
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:38.320]   So you must be frugal to become wealthy.
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:46.000]   If you will practice frugality in your expenses, then over time you can become very wealthy.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.040]   If you will practice frugality, over time you can become very wealthy.
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:56.180]   And the reason is the frugality, because it is subjective to your income and to your position
[00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:59.100]   in life and to your current lifestyle.
[00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:04.040]   As long as you are practicing frugality that is truly appropriate for your situation, that
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:09.640]   will free up investment income, that will free up savings, surplus cash that you can
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:12.800]   then invest and those investments can make you wealthy.
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:17.480]   And if you'll practice that throughout your entire lifetime, you can always be wealthy.
[00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:21.440]   Now the question is, why would you practice frugality?
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:28.300]   See, many people have this misunderstanding about those others who are frugal.
[00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:33.400]   Many people who are profligate spenders have a misunderstanding about people who are dedicated
[00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:35.480]   and diligent savers.
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:40.320]   The profligate spender very likely looks at the person who is a dedicated saver and believes
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:44.800]   that the dedicated saver is missing out on the great things of life.
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:50.240]   They believe that the dedicated saver is missing out on the joy of life.
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:56.880]   The raison d'être, the substance, the meaning that the spender gets from spending their
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:58.440]   money.
[00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:04.320]   What they don't understand is the saver looks at the world in an entirely different way.
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:07.960]   The saver doesn't look at the world and believe that they're giving up anything.
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:13.440]   Rather, the saver looks at the world and believes that they have a superior path to the person
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:16.240]   who is the spender.
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:19.560]   Now there can be a conversion of sorts.
[00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:21.640]   You can convert a spender into a saver.
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:26.000]   You can convert a saver into a spender if you can show them the value of a different
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.160]   path.
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:33.840]   But based upon what you value, you will probably make different decisions.
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:39.900]   Back to my theme for the show, lifestyles of the frugal and obscure.
[00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:48.720]   The desire to be rich and famous, the desire to have a high social standing, will often
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:53.320]   lead to extravagant spending.
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:10:01.560]   And unfortunately, the idea of being rich is often against the idea of being famous.
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.840]   I'm not saying this is an absolute ironclad rule.
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:07.160]   Of course there are people who are both rich and famous.
[00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:11.500]   But there are a lot of people who are very interested in being famous who don't wind
[00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:14.140]   up being rich.
[00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:21.280]   Now if you value status, your social standing, your social status, or how you are perceived
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:27.340]   by others, if those are high personal priorities for you, it'll be very difficult for you
[00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:30.140]   to become wealthy.
[00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:34.880]   So you should think carefully about committing yourself to that high social status.
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:43.120]   Usually, achieving high social status involves some significant spending, especially in consumer-oriented
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:44.120]   cultures.
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:49.840]   In value-oriented cultures, where your value is based upon the good work that you do or
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:56.080]   the good character you have, then you can achieve high social status based upon those
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:57.880]   character qualities.
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:03.200]   Unfortunately, the United States of America is a very consumer-oriented culture, and we
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:11.920]   minimize the value of character, ethics, and we maximize the value of beauty and flash
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:15.520]   and appearances.
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:19.880]   Now my hope is that this will change in time, but if it's changing, it certainly seems
[00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:23.200]   very slow at the moment.
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:28.080]   One of the biggest challenges, especially in US American culture, is the prioritization
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.200]   of youth.
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:33.600]   There are some cultures where people look forward to aging because of the increased
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:36.420]   respect that they receive in the community.
[00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:39.560]   They look forward to being an honored and respected person.
[00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:44.880]   The United States is almost the exact opposite, where we look down on people as they age,
[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:48.120]   and we prioritize youth and beauty.
[00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:53.800]   So if you're going to practice frugality, you will have to consciously choose a different
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:56.080]   value system.
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:01.560]   For example, you might be very motivated to practice frugality if you value being wealthy.
[00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:09.020]   Not looking wealthy, not looking rich, but being rich, being wealthy.
[00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:15.520]   You might practice frugality much more easily if you value freedom of choice, the ability
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:20.560]   to do whatever you want to do when you want to do it, the ability to look your boss in
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:23.840]   the face when they give you an unethical assignment and say, "That's it.
[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:24.840]   I'm done.
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:25.840]   I don't need you.
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.280]   I don't need this work."
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:34.280]   If you value personal freedom, financial freedom, then these values might lead you to practice
[00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:38.080]   frugality.
[00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:45.440]   So lifestyles of the frugal and obscure, well, frugality can lead you to becoming wealthy.
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:47.380]   Ironic, isn't it?
[00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:54.180]   The more you practice frugality, the richer you can become.
[00:12:54.180 --> 00:13:01.220]   Lifestyles of the rich and famous often results in people being famous and losing their wealth.
[00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:09.620]   Lifestyles of the frugal, on the other hand, often lead to people being rich, being wealthy.
[00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:12.060]   Now what about obscurity?
[00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:18.280]   Obscurity is a slightly more difficult topic, but this does go back to values.
[00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:26.460]   The ironic truth is that obscurity leads more easily to the accumulation of greater wealth
[00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:31.780]   and it leads to the maintaining or preservation of great wealth.
[00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:40.020]   Now, let me give you an example, and perhaps this will show you the importance of this
[00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:41.020]   practice.
[00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:45.540]   And I'm going to start with a kind of a silly example and try to use it as an object lesson
[00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:49.560]   to come to some more practical discussions.
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:51.740]   Most of my listeners are US Americans.
[00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:54.980]   I'm very fortunate to have a good number of international listeners, and most of those
[00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:58.560]   international listeners come from wealthy Western nations.
[00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.660]   So this is applicable in those nations as well.
[00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:04.660]   But in the United States of America, we're very fortunate, most of us, to live in a very
[00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:06.700]   safe society.
[00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:10.100]   And thus we don't really worry too much about ostentatious displays of wealth.
[00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:14.820]   At least we don't worry in terms of physical danger.
[00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:16.340]   But that's not always true.
[00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:17.580]   Consider this.
[00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:22.080]   Think about the bad part of town where you live, the part of town where you live where
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:25.260]   the most crime occurs.
[00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:31.900]   Would you really want to dress up in fancy-looking clothes, adorn your wrist and your neck with
[00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:39.860]   flashy jewelry, put your date on your arm, drive a fancy-looking convertible down to
[00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:46.060]   the dive restaurant or the dive bar, the seedy establishment, just for a casual dinner out
[00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:48.000]   with dancing afterward?
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.780]   Would that really be a good idea for you?
[00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:57.820]   No matter how much you might want to do that, you would really recognize that's not wise.
[00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:05.660]   Now, how could you be able to eat at that restaurant or drink at that bar and dance
[00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:14.420]   at that club and be able to protect yourself from being attacked, from being robbed?
[00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:16.780]   I think there are two obvious strategies.
[00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:22.020]   The first strategy is obscurity, blending in.
[00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:26.380]   If you didn't look like an outsider, but rather if you look like the kind of person
[00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:32.500]   that is appropriate and a normal patron in that establishment, then you probably wouldn't
[00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:36.140]   have a high enough profile for anybody to worry about.
[00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:40.740]   Now if that seedy bar or seedy restaurant is on the water and you drove a beat-up pickup
[00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:45.940]   truck and wore a pair of khaki shorts and flip-flops and an old beat-up t-shirt, you
[00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:46.940]   would fit right in.
[00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:48.820]   Nobody would think you're wealthy.
[00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:51.180]   They can't look at you and see how much wealth you have.
[00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:57.940]   They can just simply look and see how much wealth you're trying to display.
[00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:02.100]   Or whatever clothing or vehicle choice would be appropriate for that bar.
[00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:07.460]   You could blend in by choosing a strategy of obscurity.
[00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:12.560]   The second strategy is a strategy of obvious strength.
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:17.820]   You could visit that establishment in the company of a cohort of bodyguards and obvious
[00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:19.860]   defenses.
[00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:26.620]   You could cruise down to that restaurant and yes, you're in your shiny, you know, convertible,
[00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:30.540]   fancy-looking convertible, but if there's an armored suburban in front of you with a
[00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:34.860]   crew of tough-looking guys and an armored suburban in back, there's a good chance you're
[00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:36.860]   going to be left alone.
[00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:40.420]   So you can display that obvious strength.
[00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:42.660]   Either one of these strategies is appropriate.
[00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:48.020]   And some people are simply not able to choose a strategy of obscurity.
[00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:53.100]   If you are a rich and famous person, if your face is well-known, you're a movie star, you're
[00:16:53.100 --> 00:17:00.380]   a popular entertainer, you can try to conceal yourself and disguise yourself.
[00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:05.380]   But if you always travel with a retinue of paparazzi, you're pretty much always going
[00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:07.140]   to stand out.
[00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:11.300]   And so your solution at that point is to choose obvious strength, to choose to travel in the
[00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:15.140]   company of bodyguards, to put up giant walls around your estate.
[00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:19.280]   And that's what people who achieve notoriety and fame often have to do.
[00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:25.700]   If you look at people, no matter, my favorite is the hypocrisy of people like Mark Zuckerberg
[00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:35.140]   and other very popular social leaders who advocate for certain political ideas and ideologies
[00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:39.340]   that don't involve people's ability to protect themselves.
[00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:43.420]   And yet they construct massive estates, build giant walls around their estates and spend
[00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:47.060]   lavishly on bodyguards and armed security.
[00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:48.940]   Now I think that's an appropriate decision.
[00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:54.020]   I just think that we should all be humble enough to recommend to others that they're
[00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:58.980]   able to take exactly the same choice and make the same actions as we take.
[00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:01.100]   So that obvious strength comes with the place.
[00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:02.300]   Sometimes you can't blend in.
[00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:07.580]   Sometimes you have to buy eight lots, bulldoze seven of the houses and build giant walls
[00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:11.540]   in order to keep the riffraff out.
[00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:20.140]   But if you can blend in, if you can practice obscurity, you can achieve that safety at
[00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:23.140]   a lower cost.
[00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:29.580]   It's much cheaper for you to perhaps keep around a beat up old car or a beat up old
[00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:34.180]   pickup truck, a pair of worn out shorts and a beat up t-shirt and a pair of flip flops.
[00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:44.820]   Much easier to keep that outfit around than to pay for 24/7 armed protection for yourself.
[00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:47.020]   Now here's the reality.
[00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:50.580]   Let's talk about asset protection.
[00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:58.860]   In asset protection, it's not what you do necessarily that determines your vulnerability.
[00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:01.660]   Your vulnerability to a financial attacker.
[00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:04.260]   It's not necessarily what you do.
[00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:07.300]   It's what you own.
[00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:12.860]   I repeat, with asset protection, it's not what you do, but what you own that determines
[00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:17.200]   your vulnerability.
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:23.180]   It is certainly true that some people have lifestyles and activities that raise their
[00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:24.180]   profile.
[00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:28.660]   Let me use an example from an asset protection book I read one time.
[00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:30.380]   They were referring to a physician.
[00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:36.020]   Now, of course, a physician, a doctor, is known to have a high profile and most physicians
[00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:38.320]   are concerned about asset protection.
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:42.940]   And so the standard line of thinking that doctors engage in is they think, well, if
[00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:46.140]   I'm going to be sued, it's going to be based upon medical malpractice.
[00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:48.700]   That's the most likely avenue of attack.
[00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:51.900]   And perhaps that's true.
[00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:57.100]   But if you're a physician, and again, I read this in a book, they're referring to a client
[00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:00.940]   who believed that that was the only avenue of attack.
[00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:06.680]   And so that physician had a very nice, handsome, very expensive $5 million medical malpractice
[00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:13.500]   liability insurance policy, which did nothing for them when they were targeted with a $2
[00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:16.580]   million sexual harassment lawsuit.
[00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:19.300]   Now, why would somebody face a lawsuit?
[00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:22.860]   Well, of course, they may have done something wrong and the person may have a legitimate
[00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:24.420]   claim.
[00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:26.460]   That's obvious.
[00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:32.740]   But even if you've done nothing wrong, you will still be the target of an opportunistic
[00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:38.140]   attacker who knows that you have wealth.
[00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:42.880]   And if you look and act like someone who is wealthy, if you portray yourself as somebody
[00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:49.100]   who is rich and famous, you can easily be targeted because you raise your attack profile
[00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:53.420]   very high.
[00:20:53.420 --> 00:21:00.580]   Obscurity is one of the best, most practical forms of defense.
[00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:07.980]   When advisors perform asset protection planning, most of their focus is not on privacy or secrecy
[00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:10.060]   or obscurity.
[00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:16.060]   Most is on putting in place the significant legal impediments to somebody being able to
[00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:20.820]   make a claim against them in the first place and to be able to collect on a claim if successful.
[00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:25.060]   And those strategies are super important.
[00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:27.060]   I love the topic of asset protection planning.
[00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:31.640]   I really want to figure out, you know, I've tried to figure out how to create a course
[00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:33.520]   on this subject.
[00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:37.860]   It's very challenging because so much of it is scale dependent.
[00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:41.760]   Asset protection planning for somebody with $1,000 or $10,000 is very different than somebody
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:46.060]   with a couple hundred thousand, and that's very different from a mere millionaire to
[00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:47.620]   a multimillionaire.
[00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:55.100]   And because there's cost and complexity involved, you have to think very flexibly along the
[00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:56.100]   line.
[00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:59.820]   And I really want to bring you and do it, and I'm working on it.
[00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:00.820]   I don't know if I can do it effectively.
[00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:01.820]   I'm going to try.
[00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:04.940]   I want to do it really well, but I'm working on it.
[00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:09.380]   But today, we're talking about the stuff that keeps you off people's radar.
[00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:13.660]   And that's where privacy comes in.
[00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:16.260]   Obscurity comes in.
[00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:22.900]   If you will dedicate yourself to practicing obscurity with your wealth, you will minimize
[00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:27.820]   the number of financial attacks you face.
[00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:34.860]   Because let's be frank about the way the legal world works.
[00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:37.020]   The legal world runs on money.
[00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:43.260]   Now there is a segment of the legal industry that is devoted to criminality, and this is
[00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:44.260]   important.
[00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:49.740]   It's important for you to protect yourself from charges of criminal conduct.
[00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:54.380]   First, you need to be very careful about how you live and what you do.
[00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:59.180]   You should be very careful and scrupulous in all your affairs so that you avoid breaking
[00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:01.100]   the law.
[00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:06.420]   Now unfortunately, no matter how hard you try, it is impossible for you in our modern
[00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:11.140]   world, especially in the US American system, it is impossible for you to avoid breaking
[00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:12.760]   the law.
[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:18.780]   The estimates by some scholars, famously with one book, that the authors I think did a good
[00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:22.540]   job defending their case, but the estimates are that most of us commit on average about
[00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:25.780]   three felonies a day.
[00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:26.940]   Now we don't know what they are.
[00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:29.780]   We're not intentionally committing wrong.
[00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:38.860]   But when you have a world of crimes that are not immoral, they're just criminal conduct,
[00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:42.940]   crimes that are malaprohibita instead of malaensae, when you have a world in which these crimes
[00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:44.740]   exist, you can't avoid breaking the law.
[00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:47.940]   The question is just simply, have you been caught?
[00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:52.620]   Have you come under scrutiny for your behavior, for your actions?
[00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:55.260]   Now you can protect yourself from the world of criminality.
[00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:58.980]   I've talked extensively on Radical Personal Finance about how to protect yourself from
[00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:03.460]   the police, how to protect yourself from criminal charges, how to make sure that you've done
[00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:07.460]   everything possible to protect yourself from criminal charges being brought against you.
[00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:11.020]   You can also protect your finances in case criminal charges are brought against you,
[00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:16.060]   even if you are found guilty and you face some penalty for the criminal crimes that
[00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:18.280]   you are convicted of.
[00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:25.280]   But the risk of that is much smaller than the risk of your facing civil litigation.
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:27.420]   The risk of facing civil litigation is very high.
[00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:28.420]   But how does that work?
[00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:32.260]   Well, somebody has a complaint against you.
[00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:37.420]   Whether that complaint is real and legitimate because of some wrong that you have committed,
[00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:43.620]   or whether that complaint is illegitimate or made up in some way or exaggerated, is
[00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:47.600]   relatively immaterial to have a complaint against you.
[00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:52.840]   Now for them to come after you, most people want it to be worth their time.
[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:58.100]   There are some people who will come after you based upon the principle of the thing.
[00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:02.140]   They will spend their time, spend their money, spend their emotional energy seeking your
[00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:08.060]   prosecution because they want you to be held accountable for the wrong that you have allegedly
[00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:09.060]   committed.
[00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:10.820]   I respect that.
[00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:14.980]   Unfortunately, the number of people there is very small.
[00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:19.380]   And that number seems to be declining, at least by my account.
[00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:25.500]   In civil litigation, if you are found guilty of a wrong, in civil litigation, there are
[00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:29.300]   three different kinds of monetary damages that the court can award to the plaintiff.
[00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:32.860]   And those three kinds of monetary damages are compensatory damages, nominal damages,
[00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:34.340]   and punitive damages.
[00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:42.700]   So compensatory damages, this award has the goal of making the plaintiff whole for the
[00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:44.620]   economic harm suffered.
[00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:48.940]   And so that's where, what's the actual way to make somebody whole?
[00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:50.100]   Very good.
[00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:56.180]   Nominal damages are a symbolic award where somebody is found to have done wrong, but
[00:25:56.180 --> 00:26:00.220]   perhaps the award is not monetarily large, something like a dollar.
[00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:04.320]   And so yes, there was an actual problem found.
[00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:09.500]   There was somebody who was guilty of malfeasance, but the nominal award is just symbolic in
[00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:10.500]   nature.
[00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:13.060]   They are guilty and they owe $1 in nominal damages.
[00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:18.920]   And then of course, punitive damages, the goal of assessing punitive damages on a plaintiff
[00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:26.940]   is to punish them for their conduct and to deter future conduct.
[00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:32.820]   Now in the past, seeking nominal damages was more common when legal fees and court costs
[00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:33.980]   were lower.
[00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:38.460]   Somebody would take you to court in order to seek to be vindicated for what you have
[00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:39.460]   done wrong.
[00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:44.940]   But today with court costs and legal fees being quite significant, it's less common
[00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:50.020]   for a plaintiff to take you to court and not be seeking significant compensatory or punitive
[00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:51.340]   damages.
[00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:56.920]   Now what practically happens when somebody wants to take you to court?
[00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:02.520]   The reality is it's almost always about money.
[00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:08.020]   After all, an attorney that somebody is going to hire and they bring in a lawsuit against
[00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:12.380]   you, the attorney works for a living and they've got to pay their bills and fund their retirement,
[00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:15.700]   pay for their kid's college, just like anything else.
[00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:20.820]   And so an attorney may agree to take a case against you and they may even agree to take
[00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:24.580]   it on a contingency basis where there's no guarantee of payment unless they actually
[00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:25.580]   win.
[00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:30.060]   But they're normally only going to do that if they believe they're actually going to
[00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:31.060]   get paid.
[00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:35.260]   Now of course, there are attorneys who will take a case on a contingency basis because
[00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:40.220]   that's an important stand or an important legal work that they do, but that's pretty
[00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:41.500]   few and far in between.
[00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:45.700]   Most attorneys are only going to take a case if they believe they're going to get paid
[00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:47.660]   for their work.
[00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:57.540]   Now if a potential defendant in a case doesn't have any assets to collect on, the attorney
[00:27:57.540 --> 00:27:59.940]   isn't going to get paid.
[00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:05.700]   And so one of the first standard practices in somebody who is actually bringing a complaint
[00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:12.460]   against you is for the plaintiff's attorney to do an asset search on that potential defendant
[00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:16.540]   in order to find out what they have.
[00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:19.940]   They're certainly going to do that before they commit themselves to taking the case
[00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:22.460]   on the basis of a contingency fee.
[00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:26.580]   Now if the plaintiff is willing to pay the attorney for their work, then they might be
[00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:29.460]   willing to do it whether or not you have assets or not.
[00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:36.260]   But if the asset search doesn't reveal any significant assets because you have practiced
[00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:41.420]   obscurity, you have put in place systems for your financial privacy, or if you've protected
[00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:47.940]   your assets very well, the attorney has to sit down and make a calculation.
[00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:51.220]   Is it really worth their time?
[00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:55.880]   Are they likely to be paid for their efforts?
[00:28:55.880 --> 00:29:01.340]   Because even if you have assets, if the attorney can see that they're well protected, first
[00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:04.460]   if the attorney can't find them, that sows doubt into their mind.
[00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:08.620]   But if they can see that they're well protected, then even if they win the case, they can know
[00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:19.180]   that collecting on the judgment may be a very long and expensive battle that is fraught
[00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:23.240]   with problems and troubles.
[00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:25.700]   And this is one of the goals of good asset protection planning.
[00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:35.340]   If you've positioned yourself first through obscurity and second through a vigorous defense,
[00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:39.260]   through obvious forms of protection, think back to my silly little example of going to
[00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:42.220]   the bad restaurant in the bad part of town.
[00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:44.680]   You first practice obscurity.
[00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:49.300]   And then if somebody pierces your obscurity, your privacy, then you want to make sure that
[00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:51.420]   you look like a strong person.
[00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:55.540]   Well even very practically, if the attorney wants to take that case, they're going to
[00:29:55.540 --> 00:30:02.100]   tell the plaintiff, "Hey, listen, I'm willing to take it, but I want some big fees up front."
[00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:06.140]   And all of a sudden, instead of the plaintiff being able to bring the case with the attorney
[00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:10.300]   against you, with no attorney's fees up front, all of a sudden if the plaintiff has to come
[00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:16.620]   up with 10, 20, $30,000, there's a good chance of their not being able to come up with the
[00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:17.620]   money.
[00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:24.700]   Now, the discussion of being physically strong, of displaying that strength financially, that's
[00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:25.900]   a discussion that goes on.
[00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:30.820]   Because even if, and it plays into, it's very important in asset protection planning, as
[00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:31.820]   I just went through.
[00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:36.340]   If somebody brings, they've got to find an attorney, they may have to come up with significant
[00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:37.340]   fees.
[00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:40.460]   And then even another important part of good asset protection planning is you're trying
[00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:47.820]   very hard to make sure that you seem so strong that the plaintiff will settle, that they'll
[00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:50.140]   fold more quickly, and that they'll fold out of court.
[00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:52.740]   The vast majority of civil litigation is settle out of court.
[00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:54.800]   I think it's something like 90, 95%.
[00:30:54.800 --> 00:31:01.380]   And so one of your most important goals is to be a strong defendant so that you can use
[00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:09.260]   that leverage if the suit is brought, to at least get them to settle out of court quickly.
[00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:12.660]   And also to be a strong defendant so that even if things go all the way through, you
[00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:19.340]   lose the case, that the judgment is difficult or impossible to collect against you.
[00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:22.340]   So that's for another day when we talk about being physically strong.
[00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:25.300]   But today I'm just simply focusing on obscurity.
[00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:31.220]   Because if you could just simply not be targeted in the first place, if a potential plaintiff
[00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:38.340]   didn't know that you were wealthy, you've cut them off at the knees.
[00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:40.900]   They're not even going to go and consult the attorney.
[00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:46.140]   I mean, simple, obvious example.
[00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:51.220]   Normal person runs into you and you're driving a $500 Beater Toyota Camry.
[00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:55.580]   Are they going to look at you and say, "Well, you probably have deep pockets.
[00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:58.260]   I'm going to sue you."
[00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:05.300]   Now flip that around, you're driving a $200,000 Bentley.
[00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:11.660]   The person is going to have a very different response based upon their perception of you.
[00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:15.420]   Now here's what's cool.
[00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:20.660]   Frugality and obscurity are things that you can do.
[00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:22.700]   You don't need a financial advisor.
[00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:28.780]   You don't need to put in place any kind of a dramatic, exotic strategies.
[00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:35.140]   You just practice frugality and you shut up.
[00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:40.820]   So let me finish today's show with just some suggestions for you to consider.
[00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:42.060]   Think creatively on these.
[00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:45.460]   You adjust these for your situation.
[00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:51.020]   But one of the best lines of defense for you financially to protect your assets, frugality
[00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:53.620]   helps you accumulate them, obscurity helps you protect them.
[00:32:53.620 --> 00:33:00.260]   One of the best lines of defense is simply for people not to know what you own.
[00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:05.040]   It's simply for people not to have any idea about your financial affairs.
[00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:09.660]   Now there are different levels that you can take this based upon your own understanding
[00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:13.180]   of the ethical nature of these suggestions.
[00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:18.420]   So first, you can simply avoid giving information about your affairs to others.
[00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:23.540]   You can choose never to talk about how much money you earn.
[00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:27.800]   You can choose never to talk about how much money you have.
[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:32.380]   You can choose never to talk about what assets you own.
[00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:38.320]   You can just simply never tell anybody where and how you invest.
[00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:40.240]   You can shut your mouth.
[00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:42.420]   You have the right to be silent.
[00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:49.440]   Nobody can force you to open your mouth and say anything about what you own.
[00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:54.660]   With the exception of a debtor's examination, if you lose a judgment in court or what's
[00:33:54.660 --> 00:34:01.060]   it called in divorce, where they can force you to disclose your assets in a divorce proceeding.
[00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:03.900]   With those exceptions, nobody can force you to talk about what things you own.
[00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:07.340]   But remember here, we're talking about just avoiding the complaint in the first place.
[00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:10.580]   So if nobody knows how much money you earn, how much money you have, what assets you own,
[00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:15.780]   where and how you invest, they don't need to know.
[00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:19.740]   And you can extend this to whatever degree you want.
[00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:23.820]   For example, let's say you own a couple of rental houses or a handful or a dozen rental
[00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:25.060]   houses.
[00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:29.900]   Do your tenants really need to know how many rental units you have?
[00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:35.500]   Does anybody need to know how many rental properties you have?
[00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:40.820]   Do your tenants need to know that you own any other units at all?
[00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:44.420]   Does anyone need to know?
[00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:49.340]   Or where your assets are or even that you own real estate?
[00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:53.620]   Nobody actually has to know what you do in your time away from work, other than perhaps
[00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:56.320]   your spouse or your close family.
[00:34:56.320 --> 00:35:01.880]   And even they don't necessarily have to know the extent of your holdings.
[00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:06.320]   Now you could keep these things circumspect.
[00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:12.480]   If you have a tenant in a property, that tenant could easily believe that that one property
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:15.520]   is the only property that you have.
[00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:18.240]   Now think about it from the tenant's perspective.
[00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:22.560]   You may actually have 50 individual pieces of real estate.
[00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:26.680]   But if all 50 of those individual pieces of real estate are compartmentalized, they're
[00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:31.280]   privately owned with no paper trail easily back to your name, if you don't represent
[00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:39.240]   yourself as being the big hot shot on top of owning these 50 units, if you just seem
[00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:45.000]   like an average guy, an average gal coming by in a kind of a mediocre car, keeping the
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.960]   place up, doing okay, then something happens.
[00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:50.960]   They slip.
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:51.960]   They fall.
[00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:52.960]   What's wrong with the property?
[00:35:52.960 --> 00:36:00.080]   Are they going to be as incentivized to sue you if they think you have one property or
[00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:03.080]   if they think you have 50?
[00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:07.800]   If they think you have one, they don't know anything about the depths of your pockets.
[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:08.920]   Now you could take this on.
[00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:12.440]   For example, you could feed out false information or misinformation.
[00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:17.760]   This can range from simply misleading people by staying silent or choosing the information
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:22.200]   that you declare to outright lies.
[00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:28.200]   For example, if you have a tenant, but that tenant believes because it's either true or
[00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:34.060]   because they're simply led to believe by your absence of statements that your property is
[00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:38.500]   heavily indebted and you have no equity and you're having a tough time right now keeping
[00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:39.500]   your business afloat.
[00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:45.460]   Well, now all of a sudden you've gone from possibly wealthy real estate investor with
[00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:50.040]   one property to, "Hey, this guy's not doing very well.
[00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:54.240]   He only has one property and it's got a big old mortgage on it.
[00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:56.720]   Can't get much out of him."
[00:36:56.720 --> 00:37:02.080]   Now you can extract this and extrapolate this to other areas as well.
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:03.740]   Perhaps you own multiple businesses.
[00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:08.320]   If so, do your employees in one business need to know about your other businesses?
[00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:11.600]   Do they need to know anything about your assets?
[00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:15.400]   You don't have to tell them.
[00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:19.400]   Perhaps the most obvious example, do you need to post anything on social media about what
[00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:22.580]   you own or what you do?
[00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:26.200]   Do you need to post pictures of yourself out on your boat, out on your ranch, having a
[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:28.120]   great time?
[00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:30.200]   Now this is hard when it comes to ego.
[00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:32.200]   This is hard.
[00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:36.620]   Interestingly, one of the things that my wife and I have chosen to do is to stop using social
[00:37:36.620 --> 00:37:37.620]   media.
[00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:41.360]   And so as we travel around the country, we haven't posted anything on social media about
[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:42.760]   where we are and what we're doing.
[00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:46.000]   We don't take pictures of ourselves in all these peak locations to try to make our friends
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   jealous.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.240]   That was hard.
[00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:51.720]   Now I don't think of myself as a very ego-driven person.
[00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:55.680]   I think of myself as, or I try to be, a fairly humble person.
[00:37:55.680 --> 00:38:00.640]   But it's funny how even in the first few weeks of us being on the road, we were so ingrained
[00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:05.360]   with this cultural attitude that I've got to put it on Facebook in order for people
[00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:09.160]   to think I'm cool, that I can travel the world full-time.
[00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:15.520]   I got to put this on my blog so my listeners will think I'm cool.
[00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:18.200]   Nobody needs to know.
[00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:25.720]   And if you avoid doing that, you can avoid a lot of potential attacks.
[00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:29.440]   So you can just simply avoid giving information about your affairs to others.
[00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:33.440]   You can give out false information or misinformation, as the case may be.
[00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:37.880]   And again, that could range from just misleading statements to omitting talking about things
[00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:42.560]   to give people the impression without making an explicit statement that is factually wrong.
[00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:46.300]   You could easily give people certain impressions about your wealth.
[00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:47.300]   People do this all the time.
[00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:49.620]   This is part of signaling theory, which is a conversation for another day.
[00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:54.480]   But I could lead you to believe that I were totally broke, or I could lead you to believe
[00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:58.760]   that I were extremely wealthy based upon what I said without ever saying an actual outright
[00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:00.420]   lie.
[00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:04.640]   So you could casually give off the impression of your lack of financial status.
[00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:08.600]   If you dress and act and live in a fairly ordinary way and you don't advertise your
[00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:12.320]   expensive experiences, if they happen, you keep them private, you keep the records of
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:15.320]   those to the minimum and you don't put them on Facebook, most people will just assume
[00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:18.520]   you not to have a lot of money because you don't dress rich, you don't drive rich,
[00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:20.560]   and you don't act rich.
[00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:22.480]   You could talk about your financial woes.
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:25.440]   A simple statement, "I'll be working until the day I die."
[00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:27.960]   Or "Man, debt just gets more expensive."
[00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:31.720]   Things like that could adjust people's perceptions of you.
[00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:36.000]   And then of course you can always adjust the ownership of your assets.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.200]   You could actually use assets that are not owned, which leads to less of a paper trail.
[00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:43.880]   You could use a boat club rather than owning a boat, or you could rent an airplane or rent
[00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:44.880]   an RV.
[00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:48.980]   Instead of owning them, you get the same experience, but you adjust your perception of why people
[00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:51.440]   think you're rich or not.
[00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:55.040]   You could lead statements like, "I rent this house that I live in."
[00:39:55.040 --> 00:40:00.140]   Even if that rental is a mere administrative fact, you actually own the corporation that
[00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:02.480]   owns the house and you rent from the corporation.
[00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:06.040]   It's a simple administrative fact, we're not getting into the taxation of it, but it gives
[00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:07.600]   you the ability to tell something true.
[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:10.280]   "I rent this house."
[00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:13.880]   Nobody needs to know what trust actually, who's the beneficiary of a trust that owns
[00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:14.880]   the house, etc.
[00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:17.740]   We can go down that road as far as you want.
[00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:22.400]   And of course here are some other things I got to wrap up.
[00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:24.600]   Here are some simple action steps for you to consider.
[00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:26.600]   Downplay the wealth signals you send out.
[00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:30.560]   If you want to drive a luxury car, drive a luxury Toyota instead of a Lexus.
[00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:35.520]   You get the same features, the same drivability without the indication of prestige.
[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:39.660]   Focus on living in a comfortable, pleasant house instead of an ostentatious house.
[00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:43.580]   Don't talk about your wealth or your assets or your investments, especially stop posting
[00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:47.140]   online or displaying them on social media.
[00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:49.820]   And again, the only reason you would ever make these statements is if it's part of your
[00:40:49.820 --> 00:40:53.540]   signaling work that you're trying to adjust how you're perceived because it benefits your
[00:40:53.540 --> 00:40:54.900]   career in some way.
[00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:57.760]   This is why financial advisors always drive BMWs.
[00:40:57.760 --> 00:40:58.760]   They're leased.
[00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:01.120]   They don't have a dime to their name, but they drive a BMW because they want you to
[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:02.960]   think they're doing well.
[00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:07.140]   This is why attorneys wear flashy clothes.
[00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:10.480]   This is why people who give off seminar courses talk about how much money they have and the
[00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:13.840]   assets that they have because they want you to think they're doing well so that you'll
[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:15.680]   buy their stuff.
[00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:19.760]   And so you could also diversify the storage of your wealth and your assets so that the
[00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:23.000]   total amount of your assets isn't obvious to any one person.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.220]   Don't have everything you own in one place.
[00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:29.180]   Do you really have to have all of your cars and your motorcycles and your boats and your
[00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:30.180]   RVs?
[00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:33.380]   Do those things really need to be parked on the same piece of property where your house
[00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:36.460]   is, where you casually have people over?
[00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:38.460]   I don't think so.
[00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:42.700]   You don't have to have all of those things right in one specific place.
[00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:45.060]   You could have all of those things diversified.
[00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:51.940]   You could have a modest, comfortable house and you could keep your RV and your boat and
[00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:56.660]   your airplane in a private hangar that you don't talk about.
[00:41:56.660 --> 00:42:00.460]   So then when somebody comes over to your house and they slip and fall on your front sidewalk,
[00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:04.980]   they don't look up at your $800,000 motor coach and say, "Man, I got to sue this guy."
[00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:09.660]   They just say, "This guy's got a house and a fairly ordinary car."
[00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:12.460]   Similar things don't have all your bank accounts or investment accounts with a single
[00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:13.460]   institution.
[00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:15.060]   Diversify those things.
[00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:19.260]   And then you could physically obscure them, obscure the ownership of your assets.
[00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:25.120]   You could, again, physically obscure that you own them with diversification strategies.
[00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:26.940]   You could legally obscure the ownership.
[00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:31.460]   You can compartmentalize your life and your activities.
[00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:35.540]   If you like fancy cars and nice clubs, consider partaking of them on your own time and in
[00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:37.480]   your own place.
[00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:42.540]   Keep the flashy car parked in your garage at your house in Palm Beach.
[00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:45.340]   And that's what you use to take to the Everglades Club.
[00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:54.060]   At your business in Jacksonville or in Newark, New Jersey, just keep that old F-150 handy
[00:42:54.060 --> 00:42:58.140]   so that when your tenants and your business partners see you, you're driving the F-150
[00:42:58.140 --> 00:43:04.220]   and keep your wealthy, flashy lifestyle constrained to the island of Palm Beach.
[00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:06.940]   Closing comments.
[00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:10.180]   If you want to lead the lifestyle of the rich and famous, make sure that you're with people
[00:43:10.180 --> 00:43:12.980]   who are rich and famous.
[00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:17.060]   Don't lead the lifestyle of the rich and famous in front of or with people who are not rich
[00:43:17.060 --> 00:43:19.420]   and famous.
[00:43:19.420 --> 00:43:26.260]   But I would commend to you that a lot of the joy of living a rich and meaningful life now
[00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:31.660]   is more available to you if you practice frugality and obscurity.
[00:43:31.660 --> 00:43:36.780]   And you have a much higher certainty of building financial freedom in 10 years or less if you
[00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:42.020]   will practice frugality and obscurity.
[00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:46.780]   And after you've built financial freedom, you'll have a much better chance of maintaining
[00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:55.540]   your financial freedom with your practice of frugality and obscurity.
[00:43:55.540 --> 00:43:59.860]   The lifestyles of the rich and famous may be what people look up to.
[00:43:59.860 --> 00:44:02.020]   It might be what people aspire to.
[00:44:02.020 --> 00:44:09.500]   But the lifestyles of the frugal and obscure are well worth your consideration.
[00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:11.260]   Thank you for listening to today's show.
[00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:15.340]   Before we go, I want to thank you to many of you, several hundred of you who have purchased
[00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:18.380]   the credit card course that I have created for you.
[00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:22.380]   The course is called How to Borrow Money Safely and Never Pay Interest Using Credit Cards.
[00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:26.100]   And credit cards can be so valuable and even this approach.
[00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:27.620]   Credit cards can be so valuable.
[00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:28.620]   I'm out of time.
[00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:30.260]   I got to take a call right now.
[00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:31.260]   But let me just tell you this.
[00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:34.460]   If you have a credit card, if you think you'll have a credit card in the future, the simple
[00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:37.820]   ad is go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/creditcardcourse.
[00:44:37.820 --> 00:44:40.380]   The feedback so far has been overwhelmingly positive.
[00:44:40.380 --> 00:44:42.780]   I haven't had one negative complaint about it.
[00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:45.740]   I haven't had one dissatisfied buyer yet request a refund.
[00:44:45.740 --> 00:44:47.980]   I'll probably get some of those in a couple of weeks.
[00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:50.660]   Anything you buy from me, 30-day money back guarantee, no question.
[00:44:50.660 --> 00:44:51.940]   I won't be a big deal.
[00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:54.400]   But so far, I haven't even had a single refund.
[00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:55.920]   So I would encourage you.
[00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:57.660]   This is really, really good.
[00:44:57.660 --> 00:45:01.300]   Go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/creditcardcourse.
[00:45:01.300 --> 00:45:02.300]   Sign up to buy the course.
[00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:03.300]   It's 39 bucks.
[00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:07.380]   39 bucks, it's the price of interest that most people pay if they have a couple thousand
[00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:09.460]   bucks of credit card debt in a month.
[00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:13.380]   And I can teach you how to eliminate that interest payment, how to use credit cards
[00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:18.900]   as a valuable tool to help you get out of debt faster and cheaper, and to help you protect
[00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:19.900]   yourself.
[00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:22.700]   That's part of asset protection, helping you to protect yourself.
[00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:25.860]   So go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/creditcardcourse.
[00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:27.720]   Sign up and buy the course, please, if you haven't done it yet.
[00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:28.720]   It's really good.
[00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:29.720]   You'll like it.
[00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:30.720]   Guarantee 30-day money back guarantee.
[00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:33.620]   If you don't like it, if you don't think it's worth 40 bucks, just write me an email and
[00:45:33.620 --> 00:45:34.620]   I'll refund your money.
[00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:35.620]   Thank you for listening.
