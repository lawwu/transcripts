[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.080]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.040]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.900]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.320]   Today, my guest is Tony Hawk.
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.000]   Tony Hawk is one of the most celebrated
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.840]   and accomplished professional skateboarders of all time.
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.240]   For more than 40 years,
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.240]   he has been at the forefront of the sport.
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.320]   And I don't mean just doing a sport for more than 40 years.
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.360]   I truly mean he has been at the forefront of skateboarding,
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.820]   developing new maneuvers, aka tricks,
[00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.180]   that include incredible feats,
[00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.640]   like the 900 and 900 degree spin in the air,
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.980]   as well as numerous other maneuvers
[00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.000]   that have really pushed the entire sport forward.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.880]   He's also completely popularized the sport
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.240]   through his video game
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.680]   and through his ambassadorship for skateboarding.
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.060]   In fact, few, if any, names are synonymous with skateboarding
[00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.160]   in the general public as Tony Hawk.
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.360]   And he is oh so deserved of that title,
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.200]   because for more than 40 years,
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.760]   he has shown up as the consummate professional.
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.940]   He is kind, he is respectful,
[00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.600]   and he is completely committed to his craft.
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.200]   And that shows up in every aspect of his life.
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.380]   He still, to this day, skateboards daily.
[00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.760]   And as you'll soon learn,
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.160]   he recently suffered a major injury,
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.880]   a complete break of his femur,
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.100]   that is the bone in his upper leg.
[00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.100]   And this is what many people would consider
[00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.000]   a career ending injury.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.520]   Not only did Tony come back from that injury,
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.880]   but he went back to the very trick
[00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.480]   on which he broke his femur
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.840]   and recently completed that trick.
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.200]   That is a 540 or so-called McTwist.
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.840]   I mention this because at every level of his life,
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.980]   Tony has demonstrated himself to be somebody
[00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.760]   with incredible drive, incredible vision,
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.680]   and incredible persistence.
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.000]   And today we talk about that drive, vision, and persistence,
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.420]   and we talk about what it takes to set a goal
[00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.720]   and to continually evolve one's goal
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.720]   and to continually progress as a basically young preteen,
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.240]   as a teenager, as a young adult, as an adult,
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.600]   and well, let's face it, as a 55-year-old man,
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.440]   he is now heading a little bit past middle age,
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.280]   although we do hope that he lives forever.
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.320]   Tony Hawk, AKA the Birdman,
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.780]   really does seem to be superhuman.
[00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.600]   But as you'll learn today, he is oh so human
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.520]   in the way that he shares his own experience
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.680]   and shares with you the ways in which we can each and all
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.420]   look at what we do and think about what we want to achieve
[00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.240]   and put our minds and our bodies to those goals
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.440]   and achieve them.
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.580]   I confess that today's discussion with Tony Hawk
[00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.400]   was a particularly thrilling one for me to have.
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.560]   I grew up in the sport of skateboarding.
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.460]   So I had met Tony previously,
[00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.920]   although he doesn't remember it, that was many years ago.
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.280]   In fact, I met his parents.
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.420]   You'll learn more about that story during today's episode.
[00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.620]   But I was aware, of course, of Tony's accomplishments.
[00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.080]   I was also aware of his philanthropy.
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.960]   So he has a skate park foundation.
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.720]   I also listened to his podcast
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.140]   with another professional skateboarder, Jason Ellis,
[00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.480]   called Hawk versus Wolf.
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.000]   We provided a link to that podcast
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.680]   in the show note captions as well.
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.400]   But never before have I had the opportunity to sit down
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.020]   and talk to the Tony Hawk and learn from him.
[00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.840]   So I was absolutely delighted to have this conversation
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.100]   and it far exceeded my already lofty expectations.
[00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.680]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.240]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.140]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.040]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.000]   about science and science-related tools
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.460]   to the general public.
[00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:29.560]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.440]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.180]   Our first sponsor is Element.
[00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.640]   Element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.940]   and nothing you don't.
[00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.440]   That means plenty of electrolytes, sodium, magnesium,
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.640]   and potassium, but no sugar.
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.480]   The electrolytes and hydration are absolutely key
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.100]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.820]   Even a slight degree of dehydration
[00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.640]   can impair our ability to think, our energy levels,
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.260]   and our physical performance.
[00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.280]   Element makes it very easy to achieve proper hydration,
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.680]   and it does so by including the three electrolytes
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.380]   in the exact ratios they need to be present.
[00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.540]   I drink Element first thing in the morning when I wake up.
[00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.720]   I usually mix it with about 16 to 32 ounces of water.
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.920]   If I'm exercising, I'll drink one while I'm exercising,
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.880]   and I tend to drink one after exercising as well.
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.880]   Many people are scared off by the idea of ingesting sodium
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.740]   because obviously we don't want to consume sodium in excess.
[00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:22.920]   However, for people that have normal blood pressure,
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.040]   and especially for people
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.800]   that are consuming very clean diets,
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.120]   that is consuming not so many processed foods
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.780]   or highly processed foods,
[00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.640]   oftentimes we are not getting enough sodium, magnesium,
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.080]   and potassium, and we can suffer as a consequence.
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.060]   And with Element, simply by mixing in water,
[00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.900]   it tastes delicious.
[00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.000]   It's very easy to get that proper hydration.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.920]   If you'd like to try Element, you can go to Drink Element.
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.360]   That's lmnt.com/huberman
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.680]   to claim a free Element sample pack with your purchase.
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.560]   Again, that's drinkelementlmnt.com/huberman.
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.240]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Roca.
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.360]   Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.720]   that are the absolute highest quality.
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.480]   I've spent a lifetime working on the biology
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:02.760]   of the visual system, and I can tell you
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.520]   that your visual system has to contend
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.280]   with an enormous number of challenges
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.480]   in order for you to be able to see clearly.
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:09.600]   Roca understands this
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.020]   and has developed their eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.680]   so that you always see with perfect clarity.
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.980]   In addition, they are extremely lightweight,
[00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.640]   and they won't slip off your face if you get sweaty.
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.540]   Indeed, Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.360]   were initially designed for performance in sports,
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.700]   but now they include aesthetics and styles
[00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.520]   that are really designed to be worn anytime.
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.080]   I, for instance, wear readers at night.
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.200]   I'll sometimes wear sunglasses during the day when I drive,
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.960]   and of course, I do not wear sunglasses
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.780]   when I do my morning sunlight viewing,
[00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.660]   which I highly recommend everyone
[00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.460]   do their morning sunlight viewing.
[00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.820]   If you'd like to try Roca eyeglasses or sunglasses,
[00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.540]   you can go to Roca, that's R-O-K-A.com,

[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.520]   And now for my discussion with Tony Hawk.
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.880]   Tony Hawk, welcome.
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.040]   - Thanks.
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.720]   - I'm particularly thrilled to have this conversation
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:05.620]   because I've tracked your career for a very long time.
[00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:06.920]   Grew up in the skateboard thing.
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.400]   - I know. [laughs]
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.800]   - Had your poster on my wall.
[00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:10.780]   - Oh, thank you.
[00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:13.920]   - Your name is synonymous with skateboarding, as you know.
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.080]   I think a question that probably get asked
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:16.960]   from time to time,
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.520]   but let's just clarify the data from the outset.
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.560]   Tony Hawk is your real name, right?
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.140]   - Yes, Anthony Frank Hawk, but I never went by Anthony.
[00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:29.620]   I mean, my parents call me Tony since I could remember, so.
[00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:33.080]   - It's a fitting name given the sport and what you do.
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.800]   And we will get into this a little bit later
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.100]   when we talk about family and parenting and parents,
[00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.400]   but I'll allude to the story now
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.560]   that when I was 14 years old,
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.200]   your parents took me in.
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.840]   I slept in your bed in your home, not with you in it,
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.520]   but surrounded by your, a near infinite number of trophies.
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.360]   And I, and I, and-
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.000]   - It must've been right after I moved out.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.160]   - So this would be, I was 14 years old.
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.780]   Maybe I'll just tell the story now very briefly.
[00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:02.720]   I was 14 years old.
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:06.160]   I was at a contest at Linda Vista Boys Club.
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.440]   Everyone left, me and another kid named Billy Waldman.
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.600]   We're still there.
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:15.300]   Your dad said, "Where are you going?"
[00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:18.460]   It was clear that I didn't know where I was going.
[00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:20.880]   My life was, I was a wayward youth at that time.
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:24.480]   And so they took me in for a night, maybe even two nights.
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:27.900]   Your mom, Nancy, and your dad, Frank, were so gracious,
[00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:30.980]   brought me in, into your home, took me to dinner.
[00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:33.080]   I don't recall.
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.400]   - I mean, that tracks, that's what my dad
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.560]   and my mom together would be doing that, yes.
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:38.800]   - Incredible people.
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.320]   And we'll get back to that story later
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.880]   'cause you and I actually met the next day
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.400]   in Fallbrook at your ramp.
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:47.080]   - Oh, Fallbrook, so it had to have been '88, '89.
[00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:47.920]   - That's right.
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.800]   I'm gonna say '89.
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:54.440]   And it must've been one of the either NSA or CASL contests
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.480]   that your dad was very active in.
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:58.560]   But we'll get back to that.
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:01.100]   But I have so many questions that relate
[00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:05.400]   to skateboarding to you and really, as a neuroscientist,
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:09.160]   to the whole concept of a life of continual progression.
[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.180]   Because whether or not people listening to this
[00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:14.360]   and watching this are skateboarders or not,
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.880]   and I imagine that most of them are not,
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.960]   it's absolutely clear that you've been in this game
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:23.680]   a very long time and that you've somehow managed
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:26.760]   to continue to progress over and over
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:30.000]   to come back from very severe injuries
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.260]   and somehow keep getting better and better.
[00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.020]   So the first question I have
[00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:35.940]   is about the younger version of you.
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:41.960]   Did you have any sort of self-concept?
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:45.160]   Like, I want to be a pro athlete
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.640]   or I want to be a skateboarder
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:50.320]   or I want to have a video game named after me, right?
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:51.160]   Right, exactly.
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:55.560]   But if you can think back to maybe even pre-skateboarding,
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:58.680]   do you remember what your self-concept was?
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.560]   This notion of like I have a self
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:03.720]   and I'm either similar or different
[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.360]   to other kids in some way?
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:09.920]   When I was young, I was put in a lot of advanced classes
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:12.200]   and not that that felt like a badge of honor.
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:15.440]   It felt more like I was just classified as a nerd.
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:17.720]   But then I thought, okay, well, that's my strength.
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:18.820]   So I'll lean into that.
[00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:21.900]   And I thought that maybe I would be a teacher.
[00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.140]   'Cause I thought, well, I get all these concepts
[00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:29.140]   and I think I could relate them to kids or to my peers.
[00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:31.960]   'Cause I helped a lot of my classmates
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:33.960]   through some classes.
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.360]   So that's all I really had.
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.200]   I didn't know.
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:40.360]   And then when I would play sports, I would be okay.
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:45.240]   I wasn't terrible, but I wasn't the VIP or the MVP.
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:48.240]   And so I was just kind of playing basketball,
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.340]   playing baseball.
[00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:54.760]   And then when I found skateboarding,
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:57.560]   I mean, it was pretty obvious
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:59.440]   that that was what I wanted to do.
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:02.660]   It was once I got on a skateboard
[00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:04.300]   and realized that I could maneuver it
[00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:06.700]   and do things that were unique.
[00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:10.000]   And now they're moving the needle or anyone cared,
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.980]   but they were unique in the sense of like,
[00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:15.100]   I've never seen one do this and this feels awesome.
[00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:17.340]   And so I just want to do this.
[00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:20.260]   And so I didn't think that this is my career.
[00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:21.340]   I was 10.
[00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:25.200]   So I just thought, this is my, this is my hobby.
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.920]   This is my thing.
[00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:29.520]   And I don't want to play these other sports anymore.
[00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:31.560]   - Did you stop playing all the other sports?
[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:36.200]   - Yes, I quit little league in the middle of the season
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.740]   when my dad had been appointed president
[00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:40.880]   of that chapter of little league.
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:43.440]   Because he was the coach.
[00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:45.440]   He was always very involved in all of his kids.
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:46.440]   I have three siblings.
[00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:48.160]   So he was always very supportive,
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.520]   whatever they were doing.
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.420]   And then when I was playing baseball,
[00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:54.200]   he became a coach because he had time and he was doing that.
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.820]   He was almost retired.
[00:10:55.820 --> 00:11:01.020]   And then he was such a prominent figure in the little league.
[00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:02.780]   They said, oh, you're president now.
[00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:04.440]   And so then someone else was coach.
[00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:08.380]   And then I was skating and I was over it.
[00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:11.360]   - Did you immediately start skateboarding in the parks
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.420]   on transition as we say,
[00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:16.200]   or were you pushing around in the driveway like most kids?
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:20.720]   - I was transportation and skating was kind of a fad.
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:24.540]   So I started in 78, roughly, maybe 77 even.
[00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:26.760]   And it was kind of a fad.
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:29.640]   So kids just had skateboards and they would,
[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:31.940]   they would all cruise around, you know, like it was the 70s.
[00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:33.720]   So everyone had a bike, right?
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.140]   And you knew wherever all the kids were
[00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:36.920]   'cause the bikes were in the front lawn.
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:40.380]   And then at some point that kind of turned into skating.
[00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:41.800]   So everyone had skateboard.
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:45.500]   They're all like shitty, you know,
[00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:51.160]   JC Penny or big box store skateboards.
[00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.320]   No one had really good one, not in my area.
[00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:56.680]   But then at some point,
[00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:59.500]   we were just looking at these magazines of people skating
[00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:00.920]   and everyone's skating in pools.
[00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:02.460]   'Cause that was the dog town and Z boys there.
[00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:04.300]   And it was like, these guys are flying.
[00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:05.920]   I want to like, where do we do that?
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:09.040]   And then the skate park opened up in San Diego.
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.480]   - That was Del Mar Skate Park?
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.320]   - Escape Oasis.
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:12.280]   - Okay, Oasis.
[00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:15.420]   - Oasis Skate Park was the first one in our area.
[00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:16.480]   Actually, I take that back.
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:18.280]   Spring Valley was the first skate park.
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:22.000]   I tried to go there and I was nine and you had to be 10.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.040]   And I remember like sitting in the parking lot,
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:29.160]   looking over the fence and my dad didn't realize
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:30.000]   what they ate.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.900]   'Cause my dad would have easily lied for me,
[00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:33.480]   but he didn't realize there was an age limit.
[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:34.320]   And he's, how old is he?
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.220]   Nine, oh, sorry, he can't come.
[00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:38.780]   And then they closed, not long after.
[00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:41.600]   So when I never got to Spring Valley.
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:43.840]   - 'Cause I think of you as synonymous
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:45.160]   with Del Mar Skate Ranch.
[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:46.880]   - Sure, well, that was, that came later
[00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:50.020]   because Oasis Skate Park was opened up.
[00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:52.660]   So this was when I first, when I was like 78,
[00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:55.640]   a friend of mine was going,
[00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:57.180]   he said, I'm going to go to the skate park.
[00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:01.000]   So I had to go get, you know, it's such a hassle.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.240]   Like I had to go get the authorization form.
[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:06.320]   I had to get it notarized by the bank, by my parents,
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.040]   like to go there.
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:10.760]   And then I went and it was, that was my epiphany.
[00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:14.200]   When I first saw people flying around in person,
[00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.240]   I was like, this is what I'm doing
[00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:17.940]   for as long as I could possibly do it.
[00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:21.120]   'Cause it looked like magic.
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:21.960]   It really did.
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:24.280]   It looked like they were flying on magic carpets.
[00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:27.500]   And it spoke to me in the sense of being a daredevil,
[00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:32.100]   but also doing it individually, not relying on my team,
[00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:37.100]   not getting, getting hassled by a coach.
[00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:39.240]   It was just like, oh, I can be part of the scene,
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:40.820]   but do it my own way.
[00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:44.860]   And then I skated Oasis as much as I could,
[00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:47.660]   as whenever I get your rides there.
[00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:51.840]   And then my parents moved to North County, San Diego,
[00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:53.140]   when I was in high school.
[00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:56.780]   Mostly because they were just chasing
[00:13:56.780 --> 00:13:58.300]   kind of real estate deals.
[00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:04.460]   And so I got lucky that Del Mar Skate Ranch was right there.
[00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:06.260]   Every other park closed.
[00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:07.620]   The Del Mar Skate Ranch remained open.
[00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:09.500]   So I mean, there was a bit of luck to all that.
[00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:11.240]   And it was based on geography.
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:15.800]   - Your dad's involvement is interesting
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:19.780]   because I got into skateboarding because, you know,
[00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:22.620]   my dad wasn't around that much at that time.
[00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:23.680]   A lot of kids get into skateboarding
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:26.620]   because it doesn't require parent involvement.
[00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:30.100]   Was it unusual to have parental involvement at that stage?
[00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:31.180]   I mean, I remember Frank.
[00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:32.880]   And by the way, I remember Frank and Nancy,
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:34.980]   your parents with such fondness,
[00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:36.060]   not just because they took me in,
[00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:38.880]   but I remember thinking like they were at times
[00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:42.560]   the only point of stability in a landscape of like 200
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:43.740]   people where, as you know,
[00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:46.220]   there could be like potential chaos of any kind.
[00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:48.200]   And your dad had this way of moving about,
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:49.420]   like he wasn't afraid.
[00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:51.700]   I recall that he wasn't afraid to say what he thought,
[00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:52.700]   like, hey, don't do that.
[00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:55.380]   Like impose some regulation at these contests.
[00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:58.200]   And at the same time, it seemed to me also understood
[00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:00.040]   that this was a sport unlike other sports.
[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:04.060]   Like you're not going to regulate kids like me at the time,
[00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:06.780]   or you're not going to try and control people.
[00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:09.160]   So what was it like to have your dad involved?
[00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:11.440]   And the reason I ask is that you're a parent,
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:12.940]   we'll talk more about parenting,
[00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:15.920]   but also it seems that he went from saying, okay,
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:18.500]   you know, little league, other sports,
[00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:20.300]   which is more typical to, okay,
[00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:23.180]   this kind of unusual sport, skateboarding,
[00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:27.140]   but your mere interest in it was enough to get him excited
[00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:30.100]   or motivated enough to take you around to these places.
[00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:31.160]   That's pretty special.
[00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:32.000]   I mean, that's pretty unique.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.820]   - It was, I mean, and in that respect,
[00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:38.140]   it was great to have his support and to rely on him for that.
[00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:40.660]   The fact that he was always around and that he was in charge
[00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:43.020]   of a lot of the events, that sucked
[00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:46.020]   because it just marked me
[00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:50.780]   as one being favorited
[00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:54.060]   and spoiled.
[00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:55.700]   And most of my friends,
[00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:57.420]   their parents didn't want them skating.
[00:15:57.420 --> 00:16:00.700]   So even though they were stoked that my dad
[00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:02.100]   was doing this kind of thing
[00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:03.180]   and giving that kind of support,
[00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:06.260]   they still were like, your dad's here.
[00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:07.420]   Like, this is our thing.
[00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:08.320]   This is our scene.
[00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:10.440]   This is our getaway from our parents.
[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:13.320]   I didn't really have a choice in the matter.
[00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:18.320]   I did at some point tell him my concerns
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:21.240]   and my frustrations with it,
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:23.080]   but he didn't really want to hear it.
[00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:26.160]   He was very much steadfast.
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.640]   Like, well, I've been coming this far.
[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:32.320]   Like, we can keep our distance at these events,
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:34.800]   but people are relying on me to organize them.
[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:38.080]   And so I just had to suck it up for a while.
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:39.500]   - Did it push you harder?
[00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:41.160]   Like, if you could prove yourself with a skateboard
[00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:42.520]   and then you didn't have to worry about
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:43.600]   any claims of favoritism,
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:48.240]   'cause ultimately you can't fake skateboarding, right?
[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:51.560]   I mean, there's no deep fake version of skateboarding.
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.680]   You either can do it or you can't do it.
[00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:56.080]   And it's shown in real time.
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:17:00.420]   So, and I suppose back then I recall
[00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:03.920]   you were quite a bit skinny or skinnier.
[00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:04.760]   - Oh yeah.
[00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:08.600]   I had all kinds of things going against me at the time.
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:10.240]   - Yeah, I mean, I don't think people will realize this
[00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:11.580]   unless they've met you in person,
[00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:14.220]   but nowadays there are a few taller skateboarders out there
[00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:16.460]   'cause the sport's grown so much,
[00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:17.620]   but you're pretty tall.
[00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:18.660]   You're like six.
[00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:21.020]   - Six, three, but I was not when I was growing.
[00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:23.160]   When I was that age, I was very small
[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:28.880]   and kind of concerningly small
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:31.860]   because by the time I got to be 16,
[00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:36.400]   I was still, I looked like I was 13.
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:38.500]   I used to get pulled over.
[00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:42.160]   I literally, like I had a car that I bought with my earnings.
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:45.480]   I had a Honda Civic, 1977, CBCC,
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:47.340]   and I would get pulled over.
[00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:49.260]   And then the cops would be like, "How old are you?"
[00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:50.420]   I'd go, "16."
[00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:52.840]   Like, "Well, you looked like you were 13 back there."
[00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:57.040]   And then I shot up around age 17.
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:58.760]   - Okay, so that's interesting.
[00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:00.680]   And we can get back to this when we talk about
[00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:04.620]   your almost remarkable levels of ability
[00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:06.080]   to recover from physical injuries,
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:08.520]   because, well, I'll just share a little bit
[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:10.980]   of a biological theory here,
[00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:11.820]   which is that there are a lot of people
[00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:16.620]   that study longevity and perhaps the fastest rate of aging
[00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:18.800]   that we ever undergo is puberty, right?
[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:20.240]   If you think about a kid before puberty,
[00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:22.040]   kid after puberty, it's like different human being,
[00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:24.280]   psychologically, often physically as well.
[00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:27.000]   Some people have a longer arc of puberty than others,
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.920]   and that does seem to correlate with a longer life.
[00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:31.760]   And so it's kind of interesting.
[00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:33.040]   Some kids hit puberty and they go through
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:35.440]   all the markers of puberty in like one summer.
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:37.280]   Other kids, it's very, very long.
[00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:39.440]   And it sounds like, we don't have to talk about
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:41.120]   when you hit puberty and the other markers,
[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:44.840]   but it sounds like your growth spurt occurred late.
[00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:48.320]   That's a terrific marker of a long life, by the way,
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:49.920]   because what it reflects is the onset
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:51.700]   of a big burst of growth hormone
[00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:54.360]   out of the pituitary and the brain.
[00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:57.720]   And if you continue to grow for a long period of time,
[00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:59.580]   that indicates, it gives you a little bit
[00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:01.040]   of the slope of the line.
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:01.880]   Does that make sense?
[00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:03.080]   - Oh yeah, for sure.
[00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:06.520]   This may have important and fortunate consequences.
[00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:10.560]   So at 17, you shot up, am I correct in remembering,
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:12.080]   maybe you said it, maybe somebody else did,
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:15.720]   that you were, forgive me, but so skinny when you were a kid
[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:18.080]   that you actually wore elbow pads as kneepads.
[00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:19.520]   Yeah, that's a true story.
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:20.360]   - For sure.
[00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:25.360]   And I took inspiration from others that I identified with,
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:28.600]   namely Steve Cavallaro, because he was already
[00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:32.160]   an established pro when I started to come up in the ranks
[00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:33.400]   or even get noticed at all.
[00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:36.400]   And he was wearing elbow pads on his knees
[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:38.360]   in this full page picture of him in Winchester
[00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:39.200]   doing a back sit there.
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:42.160]   And I was like, that, I want to do that.
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.000]   And he's small.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.560]   And I feel like that's my goal.
[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:48.680]   And what I didn't say, like, if he can do that, I can do it.
[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:51.860]   It was just more like, oh, this, I identify with that.
[00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:54.440]   And that gives me hope.
[00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:55.880]   - And as I recall, Stevie also has
[00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:58.000]   a pretty severe scoliosis, right?
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.960]   Like at one point, at one point he was turned pretty,
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:04.260]   pretty tight to the right or left, I don't recall,
[00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:06.560]   which I mean, still incredible skateboarder, love Stevie.
[00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:07.400]   He's a NorCal guy.
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:08.240]   So I grew up around him.
[00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:10.040]   - Yeah, I know whatever he had is from birth,
[00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:14.000]   but it was more that his size.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.180]   And I didn't even know he was many, not many,
[00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:19.700]   but no, he's like four years older than me.
[00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:22.960]   So I just was like, oh, there's small guys doing that.
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:24.520]   I can do it maybe.
[00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:28.320]   But when I got tall, when I went through puberty,
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:31.440]   suddenly I had all these tricks.
[00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:35.440]   And then suddenly I had the strength and the height
[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:37.440]   that gave me confidence.
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:38.560]   And so all of a sudden it was like,
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:41.520]   oh, I can go way higher now.
[00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:43.500]   And I'm comfortable with these tricks,
[00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:45.880]   these intricate board maneuvers and stuff.
[00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:48.320]   So that was a huge advantage to me.
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:53.520]   The smaller stuff felt different after that,
[00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:57.760]   which was harder, but being able to blast eight feet
[00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:59.880]   in the air as opposed to four feet in the air
[00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:01.180]   was a huge advantage.
[00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:03.580]   - Yeah, isn't that wild when the nervous system
[00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:06.140]   knows how to do something and then your body changes
[00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:07.580]   and you can do the same thing,
[00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:09.200]   but with so much more force.
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:11.640]   - Even the bowls look smaller.
[00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:13.020]   When I would stand on top of it, I was like, wait,
[00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:14.860]   this isn't that big?
[00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:17.120]   - It's wild.
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:18.200]   Well, the reason I ask about this,
[00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:23.060]   I think people listening generally seem to assume that
[00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:24.560]   if you become a Stanford professor
[00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:26.000]   or you become a professional skateboarder
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.200]   or you become a professional soccer player,
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:30.680]   that you were just fated to become that, right?
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:32.200]   And it's clear that it's the confluence
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:33.820]   of so many different factors,
[00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:37.920]   but one of the consistent factors for sure
[00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:40.360]   is a sense that you just really love doing it, right?
[00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:44.560]   I mean, I can't imagine getting proficient
[00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:47.800]   or excellent at anything without loving doing it, right?
[00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:52.140]   And so still at this time when you were, let's say 14, 15,
[00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:56.580]   did you have any concept of, I'm gonna have a pro model,
[00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:57.840]   I'm gonna, none of that.
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:01.160]   - Well, there was none of that to be had.
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:03.560]   So we didn't have these great aspirations
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:06.680]   because no one had really done that before.
[00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:08.920]   There were, you could have some success.
[00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:11.000]   Yes, you could have maybe a signature model,
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.320]   but even the top sales of skateboarding then
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:15.480]   wasn't a career.
[00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:19.640]   The prize money was $150 for first place,
[00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:21.880]   100 for second, 50 for third.
[00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:25.480]   - Couple tanks of gas, some food.
[00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:28.240]   - Yeah, so let's put it this way.
[00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:30.400]   I turned pro when I was 14.
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:34.240]   By the time I was 15 and a half
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:38.520]   and I had a learner's permit and I could drive a scooter,
[00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:41.680]   you know, I had $600 in my bank account
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:44.960]   and I used that to buy a Honda Express Moped.
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:49.200]   For a year and a half, that was my earnings, was $600.
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:51.960]   - So clearly money wasn't the dopamine hit.
[00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:54.400]   It was the actual skateboarder.
[00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:55.760]   - Sure, and that's what I mean though.
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:59.240]   There was no goal of that because it just didn't exist.
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:00.360]   So I didn't care.
[00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:01.440]   Like, are you kidding me?
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:04.000]   I have my own vehicle at age 15.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.340]   Like I was living large.
[00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:07.840]   I can get to the skate park on my own.
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:09.660]   That was amazing.
[00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:13.680]   - To be 14 and be a professional at anything
[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:17.760]   must be a trip, so to speak.
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:18.920]   But what I'm wondering about,
[00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:23.840]   because I came up when your early cohort with Palo Peralta,
[00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:27.480]   so for those that don't know, so-called Bones Brigade, right?
[00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:29.240]   I guess it was what, total what, like six, seven guys?
[00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:30.560]   There were some that were a little more peripheral
[00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:32.120]   than others.
[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:36.240]   There were about six, seven core guys in the various videos.
[00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:37.720]   I mean, you guys were famous, right?
[00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:42.000]   You had posters on kids' walls who skateboarded.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.780]   There was a second or maybe it was a third surge
[00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:46.240]   of popularity in skateboarding
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:50.280]   because it would sort of surge in general popularity
[00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:52.960]   then disappear and come back as it has over decades.
[00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:56.080]   It keeps coming and going to some extent.
[00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:59.400]   Did you have a conscious awareness of just how,
[00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:02.640]   how much attention was being placed on photos of you,
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:03.480]   videos of you?
[00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:05.200]   And I'm just wondering about the younger version of you,
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:08.880]   whether or not you realize what was happening.
[00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:11.800]   And the reason I ask is because you've always seemed to me
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:14.320]   somebody who, through interviews, through videos,
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:15.840]   through our interactions,
[00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:18.700]   and for those that have known you much longer than I have,
[00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:23.500]   just very grounded, like not caught up in it.
[00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:27.000]   We've never seen headlines about you kind of just
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.720]   blowing all your money or wrecking cars
[00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:31.240]   and destroying your life.
[00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:33.240]   I mean, I'm sure you've made mistakes like any of us,
[00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:36.440]   but you seem to have avoided a lot of the pitfalls
[00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:38.880]   of quote-unquote famous people and celebrities.
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:42.160]   And yet you were a famous person from a very young age.
[00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:47.680]   - Yeah, well, I think it was that I didn't never,
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.480]   that was never a goal.
[00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:54.360]   And then when I had a sense of it, I was very uncomfortable.
[00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:55.300]   I mean, I was happy.
[00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:56.640]   I was happy to be successful.
[00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:58.640]   I was happy that people recognized me.
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:02.480]   That was amazing just because I was good at skateboarding.
[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:04.820]   I never imagined something like that.
[00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:06.520]   And, but I was always very,
[00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:10.240]   I mean, some people thought that I was sort of
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:13.200]   almost like pompous or arrogant because I wasn't interacting
[00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:14.660]   because I was just, I was walled off.
[00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:16.040]   I was like, I don't know what to do.
[00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:18.880]   - Gosh, this is the last words I would ever use
[00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:19.920]   to describe you.
[00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:22.200]   - I think it was just more that people would see me,
[00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:23.040]   like I'd go to a ramp.
[00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:24.840]   I didn't know anybody and I would just start skating
[00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:26.760]   and I'd do all my stuff and they were like,
[00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:28.960]   oh, he doesn't even talk to anyone.
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:31.460]   And I was like, I don't know what to do.
[00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:32.300]   I don't know how to act.
[00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:33.600]   - Also you were 14 years old.
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:35.920]   - Right, so Stacey broke me out of that.
[00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:37.320]   'Cause I remember one time there was a kid
[00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:39.600]   that was just staring at me, like holding my skateboard.
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:41.440]   He had my signature model and he said,
[00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:43.080]   go say hi to that guy.
[00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:44.360]   What, are you sure?
[00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:47.960]   Like he wants to interact with you, you know,
[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:49.360]   just go high five him or anything.
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:53.260]   And I learned to sort of break out of my comfort zone
[00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:55.800]   by doing that enough.
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:57.400]   But my first go around, I mean,
[00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:01.840]   that was sort of my first wave of fame, I'd say,
[00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:03.840]   the Bones Brigade years.
[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:07.880]   And we were so young that we thought this is forever.
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:11.440]   And so we were definitely careless with our money,
[00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:12.760]   with our actions.
[00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:17.760]   And at some point my dad saw that he didn't think
[00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:20.120]   it was gonna be long-term.
[00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:22.440]   'Cause no one had had a long-term career, right?
[00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:27.440]   So he encouraged me to invest, to get property,
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:31.120]   like to buy a house.
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:33.040]   That was my saving grace.
[00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:35.520]   'Cause I definitely was spending.
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:38.160]   - On cars and things like that.
[00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:41.080]   - Yeah, car, like kind of a little bit beyond my means.
[00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:45.120]   I wasn't really considering, all my money was 1099 income.
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:47.280]   So it wasn't, we weren't paying taxes on anything.
[00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:48.440]   And at the end of the year, it'd be like,
[00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:49.280]   oh, you owe this much.
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:51.280]   Like, wait, what are you talking about?
[00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:56.240]   So for instance, hey, do you wanna go to Hawaii?
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:58.720]   Yeah, okay, invite everyone.
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:00.340]   We're all going to Hawaii.
[00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:01.720]   I got, well, let's rent a place.
[00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:06.080]   Okay, and it was on me 'cause I had the means.
[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:06.960]   - You mentioned Stacy.
[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:09.480]   We should probably clarify for people.
[00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:12.440]   Tony's referring to the great Stacy Peralta.
[00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:15.720]   - Yeah, he was the one who put me on the Bones Brigade.
[00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:20.520]   When I was still considered sort of a circus act,
[00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:24.600]   like a, my skating was not really established.
[00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:27.380]   The stuff that I was doing was largely made fun of
[00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:29.800]   because people thought that what I was doing
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:31.420]   was just more like a free show.
[00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:33.320]   - Can you explain more?
[00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:35.920]   So my, and let me just tell you that my recollection,
[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:37.880]   first recollection of you,
[00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:40.480]   that I still have that image in my mind would,
[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:42.680]   is the finger flip air, right?
[00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:44.880]   So for folks that aren't familiar with skateboarding,
[00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:47.240]   people ride around on transition or in the street,
[00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:48.200]   handrails, stairs, you know,
[00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:50.080]   people are probably familiar with all those things,
[00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:52.920]   but skateboards will ride up toward the top of the pool
[00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:54.700]   or the ramp, and they'll do something on the so-called lip
[00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:57.060]   or the coping, that's to ride at the edge of it,
[00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:59.020]   or they'll go above it, like in the air.
[00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:01.280]   But I recall seeing you do the finger flip air.
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:03.880]   I'd never seen anyone flip a board in the air.
[00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:06.680]   I'd seen people do varial, so move it.
[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:08.240]   This is going to be complicated for people just listening,
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:10.280]   but just flip it upside down
[00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:12.760]   and then catch it in and finger flip air.
[00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:15.500]   That was, I remember that was jaw drop, right?
[00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:19.280]   It was like, so if that was considered circus era
[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:21.640]   or circus like, then I don't know,
[00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:23.520]   I don't know what it was being compared to,
[00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:27.560]   because at the time we probably watched that,
[00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:29.040]   it was in slow motion, as I recall,
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:33.920]   and we probably watched it 3000 times, you know, that summer.
[00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:34.760]   There was a big group of us
[00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:36.960]   that all started skateboarding that summer.
[00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:39.800]   - I would say kind of just before that in that window
[00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:44.800]   is when people were more giving me flack
[00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:47.400]   for what I was doing,
[00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:50.140]   because I was mostly doing board variation stuff,
[00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:52.280]   but I still didn't have the height.
[00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:53.100]   - The height in terms of the height.
[00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:55.760]   - The height in terms of getting in the air.
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:58.860]   So I was doing all this stuff kind of right at coping level.
[00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:01.520]   And so people weren't taking it into consideration
[00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:04.200]   or giving it much merit because it was just like,
[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:06.280]   oh, he's doing a little board twist or a board turn.
[00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:08.840]   And then when I started to get some height
[00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:11.960]   around the time you saw and started doing those tricks,
[00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:14.560]   like visibly way up high,
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:19.560]   that's when the shift happened in terms of more acceptance.
[00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:24.680]   But I was still labeled as like a trick skater, robot skater.
[00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:29.560]   And then you had Christian Osoy, who was all style.
[00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:31.260]   Air is higher than anyone.
[00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:32.360]   Anytime he did a trick,
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:36.000]   it was gonna be so flashy and so amazing.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.200]   - And rockstar personality.
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:38.380]   - And rockstar personality.
[00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:43.360]   And so in that era, I mean, it was very divided.
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:47.800]   It was like, no one liked us both, you know what I mean?
[00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:50.460]   It was just so strange to be of that age
[00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:53.060]   and of doing something
[00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:57.200]   that had never really been established.
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:00.040]   And then suddenly I'm pitted against another skater
[00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:01.440]   and we're just trying to make our way
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:05.400]   through teen years and skateboarding.
[00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:08.080]   And it was hard.
[00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:11.040]   I mean, it was like, I got bullied.
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:13.460]   You know, yes, I was successful.
[00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:18.460]   Yes, I was doing, but I would get thrasher magazine
[00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:21.600]   would talk shit about my performance when I would win.
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:22.440]   - Yeah, I remember that
[00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:23.720]   because I was from Northern California
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.260]   and thrasher magazine was skateboard magazine
[00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:26.380]   from Northern California.
[00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:27.640]   I actually wrote for them for a while
[00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:30.360]   when I was a postdoc to make some extra money
[00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:31.540]   under a different name folks,
[00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:35.000]   but you can try and find those articles they're out there.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.280]   And then in Southern California,
[00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:38.280]   it was skateboarder mag, trans world,
[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:39.760]   mostly trans world skateboarding.
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:42.080]   - Yeah, it was a trans world skateboarding
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:44.080]   and thrasher magazine were the two.
[00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:44.920]   - The rivals.
[00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:46.280]   - Right.
[00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:49.240]   - So yeah, I recall some of those things that were said.
[00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:51.980]   It just is amazing to me,
[00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:54.020]   but it brings about a really important lesson,
[00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:57.600]   which is, you know, that kid that gets made fun of,
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:59.860]   if they're determined and they love what they're doing,
[00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:02.000]   that's going to be the kid that blows everyone away later.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.280]   And I know this for sure, because I'll never forget there.
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:06.920]   Do you remember the back to the city contests
[00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:08.280]   that were called in San Francisco?
[00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:09.940]   So I went to those, they were in the drain fountains
[00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:11.480]   in front of city hall.
[00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:12.460]   I remember getting there one day
[00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:15.200]   and there was this guy with kind of like Afro-like hair
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:16.920]   pushing around and he was doing what are called daffies.
[00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:17.760]   He had two skateboards.
[00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:18.920]   He was kind of like weaving around.
[00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:20.440]   And I remember thinking, you know,
[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:22.600]   San Francisco's got its issues now,
[00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:25.380]   but back then it was rough also for different reasons.
[00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:27.920]   I remember thinking like, this guy is going to get beat up.
[00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:29.560]   I hung out with the Embarcadero crew.
[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:31.780]   I was like, this guy's going to get beat down.
[00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:33.440]   That guy was Mark Gonzalez.
[00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:36.240]   So one of the greatest, perhaps the greatest
[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:38.560]   street skateboarder, if you can't really define
[00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:40.960]   these things greatest and whatnot in skateboarding.
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:44.840]   But you know, I remember thinking, this guy's just,
[00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:45.680]   he's a kook.
[00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:47.360]   And then I realized who it was.
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:50.120]   And then I realized he was just like any other kid there
[00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:50.960]   at some level.
[00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:53.480]   And then a lot of the kids that got teased early on,
[00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:54.320]   they stuck with it.
[00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:56.320]   Five years later, I'm seeing them in the magazines.
[00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:58.560]   And I think about this with podcasting too.
[00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:00.720]   There've been some podcasters that have reached out early on
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:02.400]   and had questions and I look at their stuff.
[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:05.140]   And you know, one's initial impression can be like,
[00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:06.520]   what are they doing here?
[00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:08.080]   And then you just see them two years later,
[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:10.260]   three years later, and they're doing amazingly well.
[00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:13.340]   And you're like, this guy or gal is here for good.
[00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:15.480]   They're probably gonna be top of the game in a few years.
[00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:17.360]   So you never count anybody out.
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:19.800]   When you would go to sleep at night in that era,
[00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:21.200]   were you like laying on the pillow going like,
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:22.520]   oh my God, people hate me.
[00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:24.120]   There's stuff in the magazines.
[00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:25.380]   I got to push harder.
[00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:26.400]   This is hard.
[00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:27.720]   Did you talk to your dad about it?
[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:31.240]   I mean, again, it's a lot to bear even as an adult.
[00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:32.880]   I can only imagine what it's like to bear
[00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:35.120]   as a 15 year old kid.
[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:37.980]   - I didn't really have a support group, you know,
[00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:42.920]   or any resource to voice those concerns.
[00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:46.080]   I just knew I wanted to keep getting better.
[00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:46.900]   That was it.
[00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:50.480]   And so if anything, if I was worried about those voices,
[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:55.480]   if I was worried about the whatever take people had on me,
[00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:57.920]   I knew I was just gonna go back to the skate park
[00:32:57.920 --> 00:32:59.080]   and learn more tricks.
[00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:05.760]   And at some point I had so much of that as a foundation
[00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:08.900]   that it was sort of undeniable that like,
[00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:10.940]   well, he can do all this stuff.
[00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:13.840]   And he doesn't just do it at his home park.
[00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:18.440]   And I think that's probably when the tide turned for me
[00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:22.620]   is when I started to do well at other events,
[00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:26.660]   namely Upland Pipeline, which was for the most part,
[00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:29.480]   the most frightening pool that we could ride.
[00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:32.360]   The thing was big, but I also recall like the hips
[00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:33.640]   as they're called, like the transitions,
[00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:36.320]   the way they match up were super tight.
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:39.340]   - Lot of her giant coping, super rough.
[00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:42.060]   Like if you fell in Upland, you're getting chewed up.
[00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:43.480]   It's pulling your knee pads down.
[00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:44.320]   - I didn't know that.
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:45.820]   'Cause from the photos, I wouldn't know that.
[00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:46.980]   - Oh, it was treacherous.
[00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:48.240]   It really was like, it was.
[00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:53.160]   And I wanted to do well at the event
[00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:54.880]   and I would drive up there every weekend.
[00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:58.080]   Like my friend, Greg Smith was a freestyler,
[00:33:58.080 --> 00:33:59.520]   but he lived near Upland.
[00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:02.360]   And so I would go Friday after school,
[00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:04.080]   straight to Upland, skate at night,
[00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:07.440]   skate Saturday all day, skate Sunday early,
[00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:11.180]   and then drive home 'cause I live in San Diego.
[00:34:11.180 --> 00:34:14.560]   And I just made it my mission to figure that thing out
[00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:18.040]   because that was the proving ground for me.
[00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:22.640]   And so if I could skate that, I could go skating.
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:23.540]   - As many of you know,
[00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:26.220]   I've been taking AG1 daily since 2012.
[00:34:26.220 --> 00:34:28.680]   So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:30.980]   AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:31.820]   that's designed to meet
[00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:34.040]   all of your foundational nutrition needs.
[00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:35.680]   Now, of course, I try to get enough servings
[00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:37.960]   of vitamins and minerals through whole food sources
[00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:40.220]   that include vegetables and fruits every day.
[00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:42.880]   But oftentimes I simply can't get enough servings.
[00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:45.880]   But with AG1, I'm sure to get enough vitamins and minerals
[00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:47.620]   and the probiotics that I need.
[00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:50.800]   And it also contains adaptogens to help buffer stress.
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:53.600]   Simply put, I always feel better when I take AG1.
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:56.120]   I have more focus and energy and I sleep better
[00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:58.360]   and it also happens to taste great.
[00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:00.220]   For all these reasons, whenever I'm asked,
[00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:02.920]   if you could take just one supplement, what would it be?
[00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:04.500]   I answer AG1.
[00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:08.660]   If you'd like to try AG1, go to drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:10.140]   to claim a special offer.
[00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:12.680]   From now until August 12th, 2023,
[00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:15.040]   AG1 is giving away 10 free travel packs
[00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:17.760]   plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:21.180]   Again, if you go to drinkag1.com/huberman,
[00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:24.200]   you can claim the special offer of 10 free travel packs
[00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:27.020]   plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:29.480]   - So it's clear you had enormous drive.
[00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:33.800]   Let's talk a little bit about the process of trying tricks,
[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:35.320]   the anxiety associated with it.
[00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:39.120]   Did you and do you have a sort of systematic process?
[00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:42.000]   Was it, you know, I'm gonna learn the basics first.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.040]   Like, did you say that?
[00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:44.760]   Did you say, okay, I'm gonna learn how to do stuff,
[00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:46.280]   you know, at coping level.
[00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:48.400]   Then I'm gonna do a little layer, then I'm gonna go bigger.
[00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:49.240]   I'm gonna do this.
[00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:54.240]   Or did you just sort of try what you wanted to try?
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:56.760]   And obviously you weren't haphazard about it.
[00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:59.040]   Like, it seems you were pretty systematic
[00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:01.700]   about exploring what's possible
[00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:03.880]   and then pushing forward little by little.
[00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:05.840]   But yeah, maybe you could talk a little bit
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:08.080]   about how you have conceptualized,
[00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:09.720]   okay, tomorrow I wanna try this.
[00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:15.880]   - It comes in different forms, but for the most part,
[00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:19.600]   I think about how I could combine existing tricks
[00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:23.100]   and would this trick work going into this trick
[00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:25.280]   and could your body position shift
[00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:28.200]   or would it all work in unison?
[00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:30.760]   And when I approach a new trick,
[00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:34.920]   I'm saying more in the last 20 years,
[00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:38.420]   my thought process is I have all the pieces to this.
[00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:40.520]   I've done every bit of it.
[00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:44.660]   I've done the first part of the trick in another form.
[00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:49.400]   I've done the second part or the grinding of it or whatever,
[00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:51.780]   usually in some other basic way.
[00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:53.600]   And then the landing is,
[00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:56.060]   well, the landing is from whatever that is.
[00:36:56.060 --> 00:36:59.320]   And if you can throw all those things together
[00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:01.780]   and make the timing work, it's gonna work.
[00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:06.780]   And I never went at something with some haphazard approach
[00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:10.180]   or throwing caution to the wind, like hope this,
[00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:11.240]   see what happens.
[00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:14.080]   It's always very much like, I know I have all these things.
[00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:16.820]   And so I just have to put them together.
[00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:20.940]   And I mean, now things are so technical
[00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:23.940]   that my same approach that I'm doing hundreds of times,
[00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:24.940]   one of them just works.
[00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:26.980]   And it's not because I didn't,
[00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:28.580]   it's not because I committed to that one.
[00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:32.300]   It's because of some tiny fractional adjustment
[00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:34.800]   that happened that I didn't even know happened
[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:36.320]   and it just worked.
[00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:39.880]   And I mean, that kind of is the curse of what tricks are now
[00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:42.560]   'cause there are plenty of moves that I've done
[00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:45.460]   over the last 10 years even that I only did once
[00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:47.880]   'cause it was too fucking hard to get to.
[00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:51.320]   And I didn't learn from that one make.
[00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:55.240]   And that's hard to accept.
[00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:57.080]   'Cause in the past, I was learning tricks
[00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:59.540]   to have them in my arsenal that I could just throw them down
[00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:01.420]   at a competition or a demo.
[00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:03.500]   I've got that in my pocket.
[00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:06.700]   These days, like that trick, for instance,
[00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:10.020]   I did a 360 shove it, five out of fakie.
[00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:11.460]   - All right, let's break that down for real.
[00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:13.740]   - 360 shove it, so who's gonna take this on?
[00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:14.860]   I'll let you take this on.
[00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:17.360]   I can try it from my knowledge and perspective,
[00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:18.200]   but we'll-
[00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:22.220]   - 360 shove it is pushing the board with your feet
[00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:26.340]   and letting it spin a full 360 rotation under your feet
[00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:28.060]   and then landing back on it.
[00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:31.980]   It's a trick that people do on, usually on flat ground.
[00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:35.060]   I've learned to do it up on the vert walls.
[00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:37.740]   Like I can do 360 shove it's kind of in the air.
[00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:40.300]   But I'm doing that.
[00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:44.580]   I'm doing a 360 shove it and then I'm landing on my truck.
[00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:45.420]   Right?
[00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:46.700]   - Like the axle between the wheels.
[00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:49.720]   - One axle in a, what we call a 5-0 position,
[00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:51.220]   which is basically a wheelie on the truck.
[00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:53.100]   So everything is so precise.
[00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:54.700]   I got to do 360 shove it at exactly
[00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:56.120]   a certain spot on the wall.
[00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:58.480]   I've got to catch it so that my truck lands
[00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:00.060]   when my foot hits it.
[00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:01.420]   I can't push it into the truck
[00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:03.740]   'cause that screws up my balance.
[00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:05.620]   So it has to land on the truck.
[00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:10.260]   I have to land with my weight perfectly set back
[00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:12.860]   enough that I can come in backwards
[00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:14.900]   because I'm doing this trick
[00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:18.940]   and I'm gonna come in fakie.
[00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:19.780]   Right?
[00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:21.740]   360 shove 5-0 to coming in forward
[00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:23.940]   is a whole different beast.
[00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:26.620]   I could probably do that just in a few tries.
[00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:28.700]   But the idea that I have to land on this thing,
[00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:31.080]   balance on it like a teeter totter
[00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:35.780]   and then reverse my energy and come in fakie.
[00:39:35.780 --> 00:39:36.620]   - Backward.
[00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:38.180]   - It's so hard.
[00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:40.780]   It's so hard to get into the right position.
[00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:45.020]   So anytime I try it, there's like a one in 10 chance
[00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:47.860]   I'm even gonna get into the position I need.
[00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:49.640]   And that's the one I have to commit to.
[00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:51.980]   So every time I do it, it's so intense
[00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:56.980]   and it takes so much commitment and so much mind.
[00:39:56.980 --> 00:40:01.900]   I don't even know how to explain it.
[00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:05.820]   That you have shut everything else out
[00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:09.980]   except this one moment and this one fractional piece
[00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:13.640]   that you have to make work.
[00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:16.700]   And I've done it once.
[00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:19.200]   And I would love to do it again,
[00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:21.660]   but I know it's gonna take the same amount of effort.
[00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:24.100]   I didn't learn from that one that I made
[00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:26.220]   some trick that makes it happen every time.
[00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:27.420]   It's all so technical
[00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:29.380]   and there's so many things that can go wrong
[00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:31.780]   that I'll always accept that, okay, I did it once.
[00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:35.860]   - In thinking about the 360 show at Five Oh Fakie,
[00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:39.980]   was that something that you thought of the night before?
[00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:43.040]   You decide that day, do you ever use visualization?
[00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:45.720]   Have you ever had learning come to you in a dream
[00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:47.260]   or find that you tried, tried, tried something,
[00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:49.620]   went to sleep that night, next day, made it,
[00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:50.540]   anything like that?
[00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:52.720]   - Yes, sometimes I'll wake up in the middle of the night
[00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:54.740]   and I'll write down something.
[00:40:54.740 --> 00:40:56.180]   'Cause it was like, oh, there's this trick.
[00:40:56.180 --> 00:40:57.260]   Oh, I think I could do that.
[00:40:57.260 --> 00:40:58.280]   Yeah, okay, I'm gonna write it down.
[00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:00.420]   - So you dream about skateboarding from time to time.
[00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:03.980]   - Yeah, well, yeah, that has shifted a bit after I got hurt.
[00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:07.540]   But yeah, I used to dream that I can't skate.
[00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:11.160]   Like I'm trying and it feels like the ramps made a carpet.
[00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:13.580]   I can't get the speed, I can't get the timing.
[00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:15.820]   And then as I went through this traumatic injury,
[00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:18.100]   my dreams shifted to, wow, I can skate.
[00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:19.220]   I can do all my tricks again.
[00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:20.380]   - Oh, interesting. - Yeah.
[00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:24.960]   - A little piece of science around the can't skate piece
[00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:27.260]   or when people feel like they're bolted down in a dream
[00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:28.580]   or they can't run away.
[00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:30.300]   There's this one phase of sleep called rapid.
[00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:33.420]   I movement sleep where the brain is very active.
[00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:36.440]   The dreams associated with it tend to be very vivid.
[00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:39.620]   And at the same time, we are completely paralyzed.
[00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:42.180]   And the idea is that no one really knows why,
[00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:44.460]   but that it's the case that we're paralyzed
[00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:46.620]   to prevent us from acting out our dreams.
[00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:50.060]   It's also an interesting neurochemical phenomenon
[00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:51.860]   'cause during these rapid eye movement dreams,
[00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:53.420]   they tend to be very intense,
[00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:55.460]   but the body can't release adrenaline.
[00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:57.300]   So it's almost like its own form of trauma therapy.
[00:41:57.300 --> 00:41:58.680]   It's like you're experiencing this intense thing
[00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:00.860]   in your mind, but your body can't react.
[00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:03.740]   And so oftentimes people have argued
[00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:06.280]   that that's why you feel like you want to move
[00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:08.180]   and you can't because you actually can't.
[00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:11.220]   Some people have woken up while still a bit paralyzed in REM.
[00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:12.060]   Have you ever had that happen?
[00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:14.380]   Where you wake up and- - No, but actually
[00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:16.340]   a couple of my kids have struggled
[00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:17.660]   with that a couple of times.
[00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:19.140]   - Yeah, REM interference it's called.
[00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:21.280]   It's not dangerous and usually people can jolt themselves
[00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:22.720]   out, but it's kind of terrifying.
[00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:23.560]   So that's interesting.
[00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:26.300]   So we'll get to a discussion about the recent injury
[00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:29.220]   and thankfully recovery from the injury.
[00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:31.000]   Not miraculous because that makes it seem
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:31.900]   as if it's surprising.
[00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:33.920]   Frankly, I'm not surprised that you've recovered,
[00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:37.380]   but it is spectacular the way you have.
[00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:42.100]   But you're saying that in your dreams before the injury,
[00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:43.780]   you would think about skateboarding,
[00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:46.000]   but you felt like there was a kind of can't do it.
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.040]   - When I was doing it in my dream,
[00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:51.840]   there was always some roadblock that I just could like,
[00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:53.320]   why can't I get any speed?
[00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:56.660]   Why can't I snap or do this trick?
[00:42:56.660 --> 00:42:59.400]   It's more in the moments where it's Twilight moments
[00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:01.780]   where I'm kind of awake and I'm thinking about tricks
[00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:04.880]   that everything else falls away and I can actually focus
[00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:08.180]   on what kind of new moves to come up with.
[00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:15.620]   An example of that was recently I went to the X Games
[00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:21.580]   in Japan a few weeks ago and I was thinking
[00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:25.400]   I was gonna go more to show my support
[00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:26.260]   'cause they had a vert event.
[00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:28.140]   There's not a lot of vert events anymore.
[00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:30.260]   So if there's a vert event,
[00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:32.140]   it's kind of like if you build it, I will come
[00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:34.300]   'cause I want to show my support.
[00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:36.140]   That's kind of where my heart is.
[00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:38.740]   And they had a best trick event and I thought,
[00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:40.140]   man, maybe I could get in the best trick.
[00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:41.700]   Is there anything new though?
[00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:43.740]   And I'm still recovering from my leg.
[00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:47.180]   And then at some point I was falling asleep and I thought,
[00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:49.360]   oh, I could do that trick and come in 180.
[00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:53.180]   I know I could do that with my current state
[00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:54.940]   and not getting that much speed.
[00:43:54.940 --> 00:43:59.940]   So to explain what I was doing is a half cab,
[00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:01.800]   body varial to backside blunt.
[00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:03.340]   - Okay, we can walk through this.
[00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:06.780]   Half cab has come up backwards, go 360.
[00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:08.100]   So half of that would go 180.
[00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:11.740]   - As I approached the top of the ramp, body varial.
[00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:15.100]   That means I jump around and then I jump around on my board
[00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:18.860]   and then I make sure that it lands with my two trucks out
[00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:22.460]   and my tail on the coping, which is very precarious.
[00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:24.740]   And I've done that and come and fakie these.
[00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:25.580]   - That's the blunt piece.
[00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:26.420]   - That's the blunt.
[00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:29.380]   So I've done that and then you have to use your feet
[00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:31.940]   to lift up the board, come and fakie.
[00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:34.160]   I've done that twice.
[00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:36.660]   And I thought, well, I wonder if there's something
[00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:38.140]   I could do like that.
[00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:40.760]   And then I realized that if I just keep coming around
[00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:44.420]   and I come in backside direction,
[00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:46.380]   that keeps my body spinning
[00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:48.020]   and that might actually be easier.
[00:44:48.940 --> 00:44:51.380]   It wasn't, but I figured it out.
[00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:52.680]   - I think I saw a clip of this on Instagram.
[00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:53.740]   - I did it, yeah.
[00:44:53.740 --> 00:44:56.520]   I did it X Games and that was like, it was my last run.
[00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:58.980]   It was, I mean, it didn't move the needle.
[00:44:58.980 --> 00:45:02.700]   I got seven place, but for me, it was a huge moment.
[00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:04.780]   - It felt amazing, I bet.
[00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:06.220]   - Oh yeah, for sure.
[00:45:06.220 --> 00:45:10.100]   I mean, it was like weeks of preparation
[00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:11.380]   and trying to figure this thing out.
[00:45:11.380 --> 00:45:16.380]   I made it twice before the event on my own alone on my ramp,
[00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:21.160]   but that's just an example of,
[00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:22.600]   I was literally falling asleep
[00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:24.780]   and then all of a sudden it was like,
[00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:26.840]   half cup body roll, backside blunt.
[00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:27.680]   - I love it.
[00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:30.260]   That liminal state between wakefulness and sleep
[00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:34.040]   is such a beautiful state that if one is open to ideas
[00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:36.780]   showing up there, they almost always do.
[00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:39.340]   - I started trying it the next morning.
[00:45:39.340 --> 00:45:41.860]   - Do you ever find that when you're taking walks
[00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:45.660]   or in the shower or not thinking about skateboarding?
[00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:49.140]   - Yeah, it's usually in the sort of mundane moments
[00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:51.440]   that I get inspiration, yeah.
[00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:54.840]   - Do you have practices for pure relaxation
[00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:56.020]   aside from socialization?
[00:45:56.020 --> 00:45:57.500]   - I know, I was never,
[00:45:57.500 --> 00:46:00.120]   I think that's something I've been lacking.
[00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:05.120]   I never was good at warming up, stretching, post-warm up
[00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:13.020]   or relaxing, meditation, nothing.
[00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:15.780]   I just, I go skate and it's on.
[00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:19.420]   And as I've gotten older,
[00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:22.200]   I realized that's not the best technique,
[00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:24.260]   but it's worked so far.
[00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:25.860]   - It has worked.
[00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:27.140]   So for you, it's go,
[00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:28.700]   hopefully a little bit of warm up if you.
[00:46:28.700 --> 00:46:33.260]   - I have more of a sort of OCD warm up run
[00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:35.960]   that I use to gauge how I'm feeling,
[00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:38.060]   but I kind of have to get through that.
[00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:40.860]   - Like a surgeon, when a surgeon's about to do a surgery,
[00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:44.300]   they don't warm up, they just check off the various boxes
[00:46:44.300 --> 00:46:46.300]   of this is here, that's there.
[00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:48.500]   Make sure that they're comfortable in their environment
[00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:52.020]   and then they do the life-saving work, yeah.
[00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:56.100]   - Yeah, I'd say my warm up run is kind of basic tricks,
[00:46:56.100 --> 00:46:59.020]   but they give me a sense of how stiff
[00:46:59.020 --> 00:47:03.060]   or what I need to adjust for for the rest of the day.
[00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:04.700]   So I guess it's not so OCD,
[00:47:04.700 --> 00:47:07.700]   but I definitely feel like I got to go through that routine.
[00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:10.940]   - What feels the best?
[00:47:10.940 --> 00:47:14.820]   Like, I know that making a new trick feels incredible,
[00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:16.780]   especially if you've been at it a long time,
[00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:19.140]   dialing it in so that you can do it again and again,
[00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:22.060]   it's its own form of reward.
[00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:25.400]   But what is the maybe list of two or three things
[00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:27.740]   that just feels so good?
[00:47:27.740 --> 00:47:30.540]   - Well, that for sure, learning new tricks,
[00:47:30.540 --> 00:47:32.820]   not even that it's something that I created,
[00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:35.940]   but just doing something that I've never done before.
[00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:40.300]   When I first learned varials, backside varials,
[00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:42.020]   no one had done backside varials before,
[00:47:42.020 --> 00:47:44.340]   they'd only done the front side.
[00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:47.220]   And a varial is where you reach down, grab your board,
[00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:49.900]   jump in the air and then turn it 180 under your feet.
[00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:53.060]   It's like a shove it, but you're guiding with your hand.
[00:47:53.060 --> 00:47:56.220]   I learned that halfway up the pool,
[00:47:56.220 --> 00:48:00.480]   the main pool at Oasis with no one around.
[00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:02.860]   And the feeling I got when I rode away
[00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:04.780]   was something that I had never experienced
[00:48:04.780 --> 00:48:06.980]   and it is literally the buzz
[00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:08.780]   that I've been chasing ever since,
[00:48:08.780 --> 00:48:10.780]   because it was like I created something.
[00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:13.060]   - Varials below coping was the button.
[00:48:13.060 --> 00:48:14.260]   - That was it, it really was.
[00:48:14.260 --> 00:48:17.020]   And if you saw a video of it, you'd be like that thing?
[00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:18.500]   You're like, what can I say?
[00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:22.060]   It was the first time that I thought of it.
[00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:26.920]   I went through all the motions of it.
[00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:30.820]   I did the work and I figured it out and no one cared,
[00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:35.020]   but at some point I was able to do it six feet in the air
[00:48:35.020 --> 00:48:37.780]   and do a full 360 varial.
[00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:40.460]   And so that was the building block,
[00:48:40.460 --> 00:48:44.340]   but that feeling was like no other.
[00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:48.300]   I'd say that, and then just even to strip
[00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:51.560]   everything else away, like the most basic tricks,
[00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:55.140]   like a backside ollie is a no-handed aerial.
[00:48:55.140 --> 00:48:56.540]   That used to be what it was called,
[00:48:56.540 --> 00:48:58.640]   backside no-handed aerial.
[00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:02.880]   It feels so good because even to this day,
[00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:05.740]   people say, how does the board stay on your feet?
[00:49:05.740 --> 00:49:08.540]   And I can't even tell you how the board stays on my feet.
[00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:11.760]   I just know, I know how to maneuver it.
[00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:13.220]   And I know how to keep the pressure on it
[00:49:13.220 --> 00:49:14.620]   and the friction going.
[00:49:14.620 --> 00:49:16.400]   And backside ollies is like,
[00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:19.460]   I think it's like a marvel of physics
[00:49:19.460 --> 00:49:23.980]   and a clean backside ollie to me feels good as anything.
[00:49:23.980 --> 00:49:25.380]   - Yeah, it's a beautiful thing to behold.
[00:49:25.380 --> 00:49:27.580]   I confess I've never done a legitimate backside ollie
[00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:30.100]   on vert, on a mini ramp, sure, but not on vert.
[00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:31.500]   So I can't relate to the feeling,
[00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:34.820]   but I love, love, love the fact
[00:49:34.820 --> 00:49:39.060]   that you brought us back to that early
[00:49:39.060 --> 00:49:41.580]   variable low coping feeling and that,
[00:49:41.580 --> 00:49:46.000]   that marks the essence of what feels so good
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:47.500]   when you do something else, right?
[00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:49.100]   It's sort of like a, it's a,
[00:49:49.100 --> 00:49:51.380]   as a neuroscientist I see it as a chemical stamp.
[00:49:51.380 --> 00:49:54.740]   It's like a chemical fingerprint of progress, right?
[00:49:54.740 --> 00:49:57.820]   And I'm also delighted to hear
[00:49:57.820 --> 00:50:00.080]   that it still feels that good to do these things.
[00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:01.580]   'Cause I don't think anyone can have
[00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:04.520]   the kind of lifelong progression that you've had.
[00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:07.900]   And it's still going without a,
[00:50:07.900 --> 00:50:09.860]   not just love of the thing,
[00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:12.340]   but love of the feeling that it brings
[00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:13.420]   when no one's around.
[00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:14.920]   'Cause you said skating your ramp by yourself.
[00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:16.900]   So how often are you on your ramp with,
[00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:18.620]   you know, no one's filming for Instagram,
[00:50:18.620 --> 00:50:21.580]   nothing for a video, nothing for a video game, none of that.
[00:50:21.580 --> 00:50:24.540]   Maybe there's, you know, maybe other guys are around,
[00:50:24.540 --> 00:50:26.080]   gals around, we'll talk about gals too.
[00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:27.620]   'Cause one of the big shifts in skateboarding
[00:50:27.620 --> 00:50:30.720]   since I started is that there's some amazing
[00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:32.760]   female skateboarders now.
[00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:34.340]   There's a young lady in fact,
[00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:35.820]   that's been skateboarding at your ramp.
[00:50:35.820 --> 00:50:37.060]   Forgive me, I can't remember her name.
[00:50:37.060 --> 00:50:37.900]   Is it? - Reese.
[00:50:37.900 --> 00:50:39.300]   - Reese. - Reese Nelson.
[00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:40.460]   - Goodness. - She's a fuser.
[00:50:40.460 --> 00:50:42.660]   - Goodness gracious. - I know.
[00:50:42.660 --> 00:50:45.660]   - She is so good. - Yeah, so good.
[00:50:45.660 --> 00:50:46.780]   - So good.
[00:50:46.780 --> 00:50:47.700]   So we'll get back to that.
[00:50:47.700 --> 00:50:49.100]   But I think that, you know,
[00:50:49.100 --> 00:50:53.820]   people starting any kind of sport or academic career
[00:50:53.820 --> 00:50:54.700]   or business or anything,
[00:50:54.700 --> 00:50:59.220]   I think people assume that you go from zero to 100 somehow.
[00:50:59.220 --> 00:51:01.940]   And that there are these people that are just selected
[00:51:01.940 --> 00:51:05.160]   by genetics or by luck or by some combination of things
[00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:07.560]   to just like get it and be better than everybody else.
[00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:10.380]   But it's clear that you've spent a lot of time alone
[00:51:10.380 --> 00:51:12.220]   driving someplace to skate the next day
[00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:13.980]   or alone at the ramp.
[00:51:13.980 --> 00:51:18.960]   So do you ever reflect on that kind of drive
[00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:22.140]   and you know, what that's all about?
[00:51:22.140 --> 00:51:24.340]   Or is it just so intrinsic to who you are?
[00:51:24.340 --> 00:51:26.580]   - It's serenade, I don't think about it.
[00:51:26.580 --> 00:51:27.860]   I just know I have to do it.
[00:51:27.860 --> 00:51:31.540]   It's like, I mean, we can get into it with my injury,
[00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:36.540]   but to go back to what you're saying,
[00:51:36.540 --> 00:51:39.280]   is you're saying that people think that,
[00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:41.160]   oh, you were chosen for this or genetics or whatever.
[00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:42.500]   Have you saw me skate? - Your last name's Hawk
[00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:44.640]   after all. - Like if you saw me skate,
[00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:45.760]   when I first started skating,
[00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:47.840]   there was no way you'd think that I was a natural
[00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:50.220]   or that I had any future in it.
[00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:52.120]   I was all gangly, I was all over the place,
[00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:53.580]   I was eating shit left and right.
[00:51:53.580 --> 00:51:57.420]   Like it just, I wasn't good, I wasn't.
[00:51:57.420 --> 00:51:59.240]   I wasn't a natural.
[00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:01.460]   I've seen people that are naturals.
[00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:06.020]   And I've seen that how they don't have that drive.
[00:52:06.020 --> 00:52:10.320]   They don't have the discipline and it's not wasted,
[00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:15.320]   but they don't take advantage of what they have naturally.
[00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:20.420]   And for whatever reason, I don't fault anyone for it,
[00:52:20.420 --> 00:52:21.540]   but I've seen both sides of it.
[00:52:21.540 --> 00:52:24.720]   And I've also seen other skaters who are just driven
[00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:27.760]   and who are not really good, kind of sloppy
[00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:31.020]   and become the best, Andrew Reynolds.
[00:52:31.020 --> 00:52:35.180]   When we put him on our team, he was just like me,
[00:52:35.180 --> 00:52:37.380]   super gangly, his boards bouncing around,
[00:52:37.380 --> 00:52:39.660]   but he's trying every single trick.
[00:52:39.660 --> 00:52:41.500]   And every time he sent me a video,
[00:52:41.500 --> 00:52:44.260]   it's some new technique that he's figured out.
[00:52:44.260 --> 00:52:49.140]   And he didn't really, by the untrained eye,
[00:52:49.140 --> 00:52:51.420]   he didn't have the skill set for.
[00:52:51.420 --> 00:52:54.460]   And then he became the boss, you know what I mean?
[00:52:54.460 --> 00:52:59.460]   So I think it's just, you have to give that as much weight
[00:52:59.620 --> 00:53:03.900]   as natural to me, if not more, I'd say more.
[00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:06.700]   - Yeah, I would certainly say more for science.
[00:53:06.700 --> 00:53:08.740]   And you know, the people who are in the lab
[00:53:08.740 --> 00:53:10.660]   late at night and early in the morning and drilling away,
[00:53:10.660 --> 00:53:15.660]   not always the smartest, certainly not the dumbest,
[00:53:15.660 --> 00:53:19.060]   but smart enough to show up when other people are leaving
[00:53:19.060 --> 00:53:19.940]   and continue.
[00:53:19.940 --> 00:53:21.700]   And I think there has to be a little bit
[00:53:21.700 --> 00:53:26.140]   of friction internally and maybe externally also,
[00:53:26.140 --> 00:53:29.660]   but just some friction, some I'm gonna show you.
[00:53:29.660 --> 00:53:32.980]   - Yes, okay, my best example of that,
[00:53:32.980 --> 00:53:35.780]   and I haven't talked about this yet,
[00:53:35.780 --> 00:53:37.900]   'cause I did it privately,
[00:53:37.900 --> 00:53:41.540]   but I broke my leg doing a McTwist,
[00:53:41.540 --> 00:53:44.220]   something that I've done thousands of times.
[00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:45.140]   - 540.
[00:53:45.140 --> 00:53:47.780]   - 540, yeah, so it's a one and a half spin
[00:53:47.780 --> 00:53:49.020]   in the backside direction.
[00:53:49.020 --> 00:53:52.100]   But that particular grab that you do makes it a McTwist
[00:53:52.100 --> 00:53:54.540]   because it makes you kind of flip upside down.
[00:53:54.540 --> 00:53:56.740]   So it's kind of a one and a half somersault.
[00:53:56.740 --> 00:53:59.500]   It's not my trick, it's Mike McGill's trick.
[00:53:59.500 --> 00:54:03.100]   I learned it not long after he created it in 1984.
[00:54:03.100 --> 00:54:04.700]   Been doing it ever since.
[00:54:04.700 --> 00:54:07.980]   I mean, I'm talking about 40 years McTwist, right?
[00:54:07.980 --> 00:54:11.200]   I've gotten hurt once or twice, but not bad.
[00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:14.560]   Anyway, I fucked around and found out,
[00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:18.420]   did one with no speed last year,
[00:54:18.420 --> 00:54:20.580]   thinking I could do it like I was still 20
[00:54:20.580 --> 00:54:23.240]   and got tangled up and broke my femur.
[00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:27.160]   I had a super long recovery, I had a false start,
[00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:29.040]   I had a non-union fracture,
[00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:31.280]   which means my bone never connected back to itself
[00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:33.400]   and it kept pushing itself further away.
[00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:36.200]   And that's all.
[00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:40.700]   In the past, I got a second surgery in November.
[00:54:40.700 --> 00:54:43.540]   And all along in the back of my head is,
[00:54:43.540 --> 00:54:45.480]   I gotta get back to 540s, I have to.
[00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:49.880]   And I can't explain why I have to.
[00:54:49.880 --> 00:54:52.340]   I hate that it means that much to me.
[00:54:53.340 --> 00:54:56.340]   But it's in here.
[00:54:56.340 --> 00:54:57.180]   You know what I mean?
[00:54:57.180 --> 00:54:58.900]   It's not a sense of pride.
[00:54:58.900 --> 00:55:02.080]   It's not like, I have to prove this to anyone.
[00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:03.580]   I just have to do it.
[00:55:03.580 --> 00:55:06.480]   And last week I did it.
[00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:08.960]   It was so scary.
[00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:11.660]   And I prepped for it.
[00:55:11.660 --> 00:55:14.740]   I mean, even down to like my diet
[00:55:14.740 --> 00:55:17.260]   and I stopped drinking altogether.
[00:55:17.260 --> 00:55:19.340]   And I was like, every time I go to the ramp,
[00:55:19.340 --> 00:55:21.480]   I'm just trying 540s like to get the spin,
[00:55:21.480 --> 00:55:25.100]   to get the landing zone with no intention of making it,
[00:55:25.100 --> 00:55:26.300]   just that I had to get there.
[00:55:26.300 --> 00:55:28.440]   And then I had to have this heart to heart with my wife
[00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:31.260]   that she doesn't want to see me get hurt.
[00:55:31.260 --> 00:55:32.100]   She doesn't want to see me
[00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:34.240]   risking myself at this age anymore.
[00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:35.080]   She doesn't want to live
[00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:37.620]   through another traumatic injury with me.
[00:55:37.620 --> 00:55:41.940]   And I had to tell her, I have to do this.
[00:55:41.940 --> 00:55:44.500]   She was gracious and accepting
[00:55:44.500 --> 00:55:47.820]   and that's all I could ask for.
[00:55:47.820 --> 00:55:49.860]   It wasn't like she was like, yeah, you gotta go do it.
[00:55:49.860 --> 00:55:53.500]   It was like, okay, that's who you are.
[00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:56.700]   And so she was there.
[00:55:56.700 --> 00:55:58.300]   She was my only spectator.
[00:55:58.300 --> 00:56:00.400]   - So good.
[00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:02.780]   I confess I've seen a video of this
[00:56:02.780 --> 00:56:07.780]   and my first response was, F yes.
[00:56:07.780 --> 00:56:11.260]   And my second response was, that was really high.
[00:56:11.260 --> 00:56:14.340]   Like this is no, you know, just above coping 540.
[00:56:14.340 --> 00:56:17.140]   This isn't even, you know, this is a head high 540.
[00:56:17.140 --> 00:56:18.980]   - I'm not going to make the same mistake I did last time
[00:56:18.980 --> 00:56:20.300]   where I tried it low thinking
[00:56:20.300 --> 00:56:21.580]   I just get away with it anymore.
[00:56:21.580 --> 00:56:26.340]   So the going high was more of a safety measure,
[00:56:26.340 --> 00:56:27.980]   which is ironic.
[00:56:27.980 --> 00:56:31.780]   The bigger the ramps for me, the safer it is
[00:56:31.780 --> 00:56:33.420]   because I have a better landing zone.
[00:56:33.420 --> 00:56:35.940]   I have more time in the air to adjust.
[00:56:35.940 --> 00:56:37.300]   And even though it looks spectacular
[00:56:37.300 --> 00:56:38.140]   and you're six feet in the air,
[00:56:38.140 --> 00:56:40.420]   it's just like, no, I need that.
[00:56:40.420 --> 00:56:42.660]   I can't skate some eight foot pool.
[00:56:42.660 --> 00:56:44.260]   I have no landing zone.
[00:56:44.260 --> 00:56:45.100]   I'm too tall.
[00:56:45.100 --> 00:56:49.380]   I've moved too slowly now to do that kind of stuff.
[00:56:49.380 --> 00:56:51.540]   So that's why you don't see me like in the park events
[00:56:51.540 --> 00:56:52.620]   and stuff like that.
[00:56:52.620 --> 00:56:54.940]   You know, you're going to see me on this 14 foot vert ramp
[00:56:54.940 --> 00:56:57.740]   because that's my happy place and that's where I'm safe.
[00:56:57.740 --> 00:57:00.980]   But also having my wife there,
[00:57:00.980 --> 00:57:03.940]   I just knew I wasn't gonna get hurt in front of her
[00:57:03.940 --> 00:57:05.860]   'cause I would have been in such trouble.
[00:57:05.860 --> 00:57:11.940]   - The emotional support and pressure is a real thing.
[00:57:11.940 --> 00:57:16.760]   And in the best ways, not to focus on the bad aspects
[00:57:16.760 --> 00:57:18.560]   of the injury because-
[00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:19.460]   - There are plenty.
[00:57:19.460 --> 00:57:22.180]   - Yeah, that I recall you and I communicated
[00:57:22.180 --> 00:57:24.700]   not long after the, let's say,
[00:57:24.700 --> 00:57:26.740]   let's call it what it was, the first break.
[00:57:26.740 --> 00:57:28.740]   And I remember you said to me over text,
[00:57:28.740 --> 00:57:30.980]   you said how long before I'm skateboarding again?
[00:57:30.980 --> 00:57:33.760]   And I said, skateboarding as in pushing
[00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:37.820]   or skateboarding as in what you do on vert, you know?
[00:57:37.820 --> 00:57:40.200]   And you said, what I do on vert.
[00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:43.360]   And I said, well, it seems you are doing a lot of things.
[00:57:43.360 --> 00:57:45.940]   You were doing deliberate cold, deliberate heat, pressure.
[00:57:45.940 --> 00:57:46.920]   You do a number of things.
[00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:49.620]   I mean, you're not haphazard about your career
[00:57:49.620 --> 00:57:50.720]   and your body and your health.
[00:57:50.720 --> 00:57:52.480]   And we'll get into that a little bit later.
[00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:54.240]   Some of the things that you've enjoyed
[00:57:54.240 --> 00:57:55.260]   as beneficial for you.
[00:57:55.260 --> 00:57:59.560]   But you said, I'm calling it at two months.
[00:57:59.560 --> 00:58:02.320]   And I said, okay, I believe it.
[00:58:02.320 --> 00:58:05.080]   And then I recall that you, was it the Oscars
[00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:06.960]   or some other award event where you came out
[00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:09.540]   about a week later, you came out there,
[00:58:09.540 --> 00:58:12.360]   you walked out, just broken femur,
[00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:14.740]   and you weren't using any support to walk out.
[00:58:14.740 --> 00:58:16.620]   So you clearly ditched whatever support
[00:58:16.620 --> 00:58:17.980]   you might've been using,
[00:58:17.980 --> 00:58:19.860]   which I think is awesome by the way.
[00:58:19.860 --> 00:58:23.920]   And then pretty soon I was seeing videos of you dropping in.
[00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:26.760]   I'm seeing videos of you doing kick turns below coping.
[00:58:26.760 --> 00:58:29.560]   I'm seeing videos of you at coping.
[00:58:29.560 --> 00:58:32.120]   And you know, we have a friend in common,
[00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:35.220]   the skateboard and generally photographer, Mike Blaback.
[00:58:35.220 --> 00:58:37.400]   And I remember texting Mike, I was like,
[00:58:37.400 --> 00:58:38.600]   Tony's back already.
[00:58:38.600 --> 00:58:41.880]   This is superhuman rates of healing.
[00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:45.360]   And I think it is superhuman rates of healing.
[00:58:45.360 --> 00:58:48.160]   Then you mentioned that you damaged,
[00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:49.560]   broke the femur again.
[00:58:49.560 --> 00:58:51.560]   So did you allow more rest the second time?
[00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:54.160]   What was driving you to get back in it so quickly?
[00:58:54.160 --> 00:58:55.640]   - The first go round,
[00:58:55.640 --> 00:59:00.320]   I just didn't listen to any of the professional advice
[00:59:00.320 --> 00:59:02.340]   because I thought, well, I've done, I've come this far
[00:59:02.340 --> 00:59:06.200]   and I've always been able to push through broken pelvis,
[00:59:06.200 --> 00:59:08.800]   broken elbow, knee surgeries.
[00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:09.640]   And I've always been,
[00:59:09.640 --> 00:59:11.320]   the timeline is always very shortened for me
[00:59:11.320 --> 00:59:12.420]   because I just get back out there
[00:59:12.420 --> 00:59:14.060]   and I get the healing started,
[00:59:14.060 --> 00:59:17.080]   but I also am comfortable with what people think
[00:59:17.080 --> 00:59:18.740]   is extremely risky.
[00:59:18.740 --> 00:59:21.560]   But in this instance,
[00:59:21.560 --> 00:59:24.120]   I wanted to get back out there right away.
[00:59:24.120 --> 00:59:26.840]   And not long after the Academy Awards,
[00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:30.160]   I was actually walking with a cane at that time
[00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:31.960]   and I ditched the cane just to walk out on stage
[00:59:31.960 --> 00:59:32.800]   to present the award.
[00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:35.720]   So that was my big coming out moment,
[00:59:35.720 --> 00:59:37.200]   but it was kind of forced.
[00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:38.960]   And as soon as I walked out the stage, I grabbed my cane
[00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:40.800]   and I was hobbling in the backstage.
[00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:46.440]   But I was skating kind of a mini ramp
[00:59:46.440 --> 00:59:50.480]   and I was already struggling
[00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:53.420]   because I couldn't put my weight on my front foot
[00:59:53.420 --> 00:59:56.080]   because my bone still had not connected to itself.
[00:59:56.080 --> 00:59:57.720]   So there's a gap in the bone,
[00:59:57.720 --> 00:59:59.940]   but there's a nail, what they call a nail
[00:59:59.940 --> 01:00:03.420]   or a big piece of metal that's holding them in place.
[01:00:03.420 --> 01:00:05.680]   But I didn't realize how careful I needed to be
[01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:08.260]   with that because it was so precarious.
[01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:11.380]   And I decided I'm gonna drop in on the mini ramp.
[01:00:11.380 --> 01:00:12.320]   Like I think I'm ready.
[01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:14.640]   And it wasn't the drop in on the mini ramp.
[01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:16.880]   It was me getting to the top of the mini ramp
[01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:18.160]   and stepping off my board.
[01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:20.160]   - It's always that kind of stuff.
[01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:21.640]   - But I just stepped off my board
[01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:23.080]   like I would do any other day,
[01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:25.760]   but I didn't think I led with my front foot
[01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:28.040]   and I felt the bone move in that moment.
[01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:35.520]   I felt it either twist or get out of place
[01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:39.560]   and I was in total denial for months
[01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:41.520]   'cause I just said, "Oh, it just hurts now."
[01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:45.040]   Like I got a minor setback.
[01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:49.440]   And then I finally, eight months into my recovery,
[01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:52.840]   seven months into my recovery, I was always in pain.
[01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:54.200]   My skating wasn't progressing.
[01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:56.080]   I couldn't get speed.
[01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:59.480]   And by all measures, I should be back.
[01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:02.820]   At least I'd be back to a level that I feel good about.
[01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:06.080]   And I went and got x-rays
[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:08.720]   and they said, "Your bone never connected.
[01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:10.060]   You have a non-union fracture."
[01:01:10.060 --> 01:01:13.400]   And every time I skated, so my bone's like this,
[01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:16.500]   every time I skated, I was pushing it further away.
[01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:20.160]   And so my bone was like this on the last x-ray
[01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:22.160]   and that was the hard truth.
[01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:24.520]   - So for those listening, just laterally displaced,
[01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:26.560]   think about a pipe that's broken in the middle
[01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:28.800]   and just one's offset to the other.
[01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:32.460]   - And as I keep skating and I could force my skate,
[01:01:32.460 --> 01:01:35.840]   like I kind of learned this hack where I can put 75%
[01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:38.180]   of my weight on my back foot and 25% of my front foot
[01:01:38.180 --> 01:01:39.660]   and do what I wanted to do,
[01:01:39.660 --> 01:01:42.480]   but it wasn't where I thought I'd be.
[01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:44.780]   And it just hurt all the time.
[01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:47.320]   I mean, it really was like, that was my trigger
[01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:51.740]   'cause I have a pretty high tolerance to pain
[01:01:51.740 --> 01:01:54.140]   and it was always hurt.
[01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:56.520]   Like I would dread going to the airport
[01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:58.120]   knowing I had to walk to a gate.
[01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:01.240]   So I knew something was wrong there.
[01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:05.540]   I went to a specialist that deals in non-union fractures
[01:02:05.540 --> 01:02:09.720]   and he had a very pragmatic factual approach.
[01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:10.700]   And it was like, oh, I would do this.
[01:02:10.700 --> 01:02:11.540]   I'm taking that nail out.
[01:02:11.540 --> 01:02:13.240]   I'm taking the other hardware out and put it together.
[01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:15.640]   And you cannot move for two months.
[01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:17.900]   - Did you obey that order?
[01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:18.860]   - I did.
[01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:19.700]   - Really?
[01:02:19.700 --> 01:02:20.520]   - Yeah.
[01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:21.360]   - So what is-
[01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:22.520]   - I was chilling.
[01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:24.200]   I was not gonna risk that again.
[01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:27.600]   - Did you, and do you prioritize things like sleep,
[01:02:28.780 --> 01:02:32.460]   nutrition, just generally?
[01:02:32.460 --> 01:02:35.140]   And did you emphasize those things
[01:02:35.140 --> 01:02:37.120]   while you were recovering from the injury?
[01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:40.340]   - Yeah, I was very disciplined in my diet,
[01:02:40.340 --> 01:02:42.220]   in my schedule, in my sleep.
[01:02:42.220 --> 01:02:46.760]   Surprisingly, I was very busy
[01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:49.960]   because I do speaking engagements
[01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:52.400]   and suddenly my speaking engagements
[01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:55.680]   were getting booked left and right.
[01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:57.420]   I mean, to the point where I did a tour
[01:02:57.420 --> 01:03:00.240]   through Europe last summer of speaking engagements.
[01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:04.500]   So that was a silver lining, I guess, to my idol time.
[01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:08.000]   And I leaned into it.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:12.800]   I made myself available and it's good money
[01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:15.560]   and it's fun to interact.
[01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:19.560]   But all through that, of course,
[01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:20.400]   in the back of my head, I was like,
[01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:22.960]   "When, when can I skate, when can I skate?"
[01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:25.120]   And then when I finally started skating,
[01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:27.780]   it was night and day with my leg.
[01:03:27.780 --> 01:03:29.680]   I felt like I could lean forward.
[01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:33.560]   Suddenly I was learning tricks every session,
[01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:34.740]   relearning tricks.
[01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:39.340]   So I just, I'm just lucky that I got to live
[01:03:39.340 --> 01:03:41.680]   in this time of modern medicine.
[01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:43.500]   - Was that two months the longest you've ever gone
[01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:44.720]   without skateboarding vert?
[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:48.400]   - Yeah, yeah, without skating at all.
[01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:49.560]   - Not even just pushing around?
[01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:50.520]   - No.
[01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:52.720]   - Yeah, good for you for obeying doctor's orders.
[01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:57.720]   And also good for you for deciding that your rate
[01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:00.020]   of recovery is going to be whatever it is for you.
[01:04:00.020 --> 01:04:02.040]   Because I feel like I'm hearing both things.
[01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:04.000]   On the one hand, you listen to the medical professionals.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000]   On the other hand, I'm not hearing,
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.920]   "Oh, you know, I looked at the average rate of recovery
[01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:10.120]   from this kind of fracture, this and that."
[01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:14.560]   It's like, it's as if you decided two things at once,
[01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:16.440]   that there are experts who have something
[01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:18.560]   to offer me here, I'll follow their advice.
[01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:21.720]   And yet I'm the expert at myself.
[01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:23.720]   Here, I'm putting myself in your first person.
[01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:25.040]   Tony is the expert in Tony.
[01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:30.040]   And I'm going to make sure that I come back 100% or better.
[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:34.340]   - Yeah, not better, and I have come to terms with that.
[01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:37.840]   Because I know that I'm not going to be pushing myself
[01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:40.880]   the way that I did before I got hurt anymore.
[01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:44.600]   There are some tricks now that are way more difficult
[01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:47.640]   just because whatever, something changed in my body.
[01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:52.240]   And for instance, I can't grab slob, like I can't do it
[01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:54.760]   consistently, that used to be my go-to grab.
[01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:57.600]   Could do that anytime, over 60 foot gaps, whatever.
[01:04:57.600 --> 01:05:00.220]   Like I could just grab, I knew where my board was.
[01:05:00.220 --> 01:05:02.120]   I knew that was going to hold onto my feet.
[01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:04.440]   And half the time I try to grab that way,
[01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:07.360]   now I don't reach it, or I grab my foot instead.
[01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:12.360]   And I don't know, I can't make the adjustment to fix it.
[01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:14.520]   And so I've just sort of come to terms with,
[01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:17.540]   well, that's not the go-to grab anymore.
[01:05:17.540 --> 01:05:20.600]   And that's okay, I had a good run.
[01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:23.740]   - Yeah, your kit's pretty, pretty vast.
[01:05:23.740 --> 01:05:26.060]   So there's a lot of other things to reach too.
[01:05:26.060 --> 01:05:28.860]   Aside from the 540, which by the way, congratulations.
[01:05:28.860 --> 01:05:32.780]   Not only is it a 540, but done at least head high,
[01:05:32.780 --> 01:05:34.320]   I've seen it with my own eyes.
[01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:38.000]   And under really great circumstances, your wife there,
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.220]   just the two of you, and after,
[01:05:40.220 --> 01:05:43.520]   and the trick that broke the femur in the first place.
[01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:46.520]   So congratulations on that.
[01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:47.640]   I'd like to take a quick break
[01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:50.320]   and acknowledge our sponsor InsideTracker.
[01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:52.680]   InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:55.180]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[01:05:55.180 --> 01:05:56.720]   to help you better understand your body
[01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:58.620]   and help you meet your health goals.
[01:05:58.620 --> 01:06:00.940]   I'm a big believer in getting regular blood work done
[01:06:00.940 --> 01:06:03.260]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[01:06:03.260 --> 01:06:05.480]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:08.080]   can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.
[01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:10.100]   However, with a lot of blood tests out there,
[01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:11.980]   you get information back about blood lipids,
[01:06:11.980 --> 01:06:13.120]   about hormones and so on,
[01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:15.140]   but you don't know what to do with that information.
[01:06:15.140 --> 01:06:17.440]   With InsideTracker, they have a personalized platform
[01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:20.200]   that makes it very easy to understand your data,
[01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:22.120]   that is to understand what those lipids,
[01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:24.100]   what those hormone levels, et cetera, mean,
[01:06:24.100 --> 01:06:27.280]   and behavioral supplement nutrition and other protocols
[01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:30.080]   to adjust those numbers to bring them into the ranges
[01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:32.360]   that are ideal for your immediate and long-term health.
[01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:34.640]   InsideTracker's ultimate plan now includes measures
[01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:36.860]   of both ApoB and of insulin,
[01:06:36.860 --> 01:06:39.500]   which are key indicators of cardiovascular health
[01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:41.080]   and energy regulation.
[01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:42.520]   If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
[01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:45.320]   you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman

[01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:55.460]   - Are there other things that you're thinking,
[01:06:55.460 --> 01:06:57.200]   can't wait to get back to that?
[01:06:57.200 --> 01:06:59.980]   Let's set aside slaw bearers for now.
[01:06:59.980 --> 01:07:00.820]   - Yeah.
[01:07:00.820 --> 01:07:05.540]   - Yeah, I want to get my hand plants back
[01:07:05.540 --> 01:07:06.620]   the way I used to do them.
[01:07:06.620 --> 01:07:08.700]   I have yet, yeah, it's so invert,
[01:07:08.700 --> 01:07:10.980]   like it's one-handed, handstand.
[01:07:10.980 --> 01:07:12.580]   I can do them now, but I've-
[01:07:12.580 --> 01:07:13.740]   - I've seen you do them recently.
[01:07:13.740 --> 01:07:16.100]   - Yeah, but they used to be my signature
[01:07:16.100 --> 01:07:18.840]   was a tuck knee ember and flopped all the way back,
[01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:21.820]   and I can't get ahold of my board
[01:07:21.820 --> 01:07:23.920]   to pull it all the way back like I used to.
[01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:28.160]   If I can get that, I'll feel like that's it.
[01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:31.540]   That was the last milestone.
[01:07:31.540 --> 01:07:33.360]   - I'm not here to diagnose
[01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:36.740]   and treat these specific skateboard trickisms,
[01:07:36.740 --> 01:07:39.320]   but between what you said about the slaw bearer
[01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:40.560]   and what you're saying about this itself,
[01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:41.960]   it seems like there's something
[01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:45.460]   about getting your front hand around
[01:07:45.460 --> 01:07:49.060]   and just kind of pulling it back in behind you.
[01:07:49.060 --> 01:07:51.360]   So maybe this is like the way that the femur's lining up
[01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:53.840]   with your pelvis and maybe some off-ramp,
[01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:56.100]   something or other, physical therapy could do it.
[01:07:56.100 --> 01:07:59.040]   - I am actually working with, at Beschor,
[01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:02.220]   he is the doctor of physical therapy,
[01:08:02.220 --> 01:08:06.060]   and he has helped me immensely through my recovery.
[01:08:06.060 --> 01:08:09.660]   And when I'm frustrated with this motion,
[01:08:09.660 --> 01:08:12.680]   or that's the same grab, actually, as in the twist,
[01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:17.140]   he worked on me before it and was just contorting my body
[01:08:17.140 --> 01:08:18.940]   and my leg into these positions
[01:08:18.940 --> 01:08:22.600]   that I don't really even get to when I'm skating
[01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:24.540]   just to prepare me for that.
[01:08:24.540 --> 01:08:26.620]   And he did, but that's what it took.
[01:08:26.620 --> 01:08:31.100]   - It's interesting that we're talking about skateboarding
[01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:33.720]   and we're also talking about physical therapists,
[01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:35.300]   we're talking about nutrition, we're talking about sleep.
[01:08:35.300 --> 01:08:36.880]   So growing up in- - You can't be like,
[01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:37.980]   none of that, none of that.
[01:08:37.980 --> 01:08:39.620]   - Never imagined any of this. - Never, never.
[01:08:39.620 --> 01:08:42.560]   - And I'm chuckling because growing up in skateboarding
[01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:46.700]   early on, for me, not quite as early as you,
[01:08:46.700 --> 01:08:50.740]   but pretty early, 12, and got out of it and back,
[01:08:50.740 --> 01:08:53.900]   and yes, I can still do a thing or two here and there,
[01:08:53.900 --> 01:08:54.820]   but that's not the point.
[01:08:54.820 --> 01:08:59.180]   The point is that the nutrition consisted largely
[01:08:59.180 --> 01:09:02.400]   of fast food or whatever was around,
[01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:05.020]   cigarettes and beer were sort of the energy drinks
[01:09:05.020 --> 01:09:08.500]   and supplements of the times.
[01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:09.980]   This has fortunately changed,
[01:09:09.980 --> 01:09:14.980]   but there was essentially no health promoting tools
[01:09:14.980 --> 01:09:17.920]   or aspects to it at all, but that was back then.
[01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:19.620]   But then over time, it seems it's evolved.
[01:09:19.620 --> 01:09:23.140]   Now I see, I saw a couple of posts from Stevie Williams,
[01:09:23.140 --> 01:09:24.860]   like he's in the gym.
[01:09:24.860 --> 01:09:28.680]   I think I saw Danny Way early on working with Paul Check
[01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:31.360]   and doing some balance work, neck work,
[01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:32.780]   'cause he had broken his neck surfing
[01:09:32.780 --> 01:09:33.740]   and things of that sort.
[01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:35.560]   So there seems to have been a big shift
[01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:38.960]   over the last 15, 20 years where skateboarders
[01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:41.480]   are taking good care of their bodies like other athletes,
[01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:44.020]   thinking about the resilience of their bodies,
[01:09:44.020 --> 01:09:46.080]   and also generally taking better care.
[01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:48.680]   Like a lot of them opt not to drink and do drugs
[01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:50.460]   and all those sorts of things.
[01:09:50.460 --> 01:09:53.580]   So, I mean, how does it strike you to see the way
[01:09:53.580 --> 01:09:55.980]   that skateboarding has evolved towards the option
[01:09:55.980 --> 01:09:59.040]   to be much healthier and treat it like a serious sport
[01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:00.200]   where you're a serious athlete?
[01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:02.700]   A word that even 15 years ago, 20 years ago,
[01:10:02.700 --> 01:10:04.520]   if you called a skateboarder an athlete,
[01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:06.380]   some people might even be offended by that.
[01:10:06.380 --> 01:10:07.980]   People in skateboarding, right?
[01:10:07.980 --> 01:10:09.200]   - Absolutely, yeah.
[01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:13.720]   Well, to answer your question, in the early days,
[01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:16.220]   that was part of the scene and the culture
[01:10:16.220 --> 01:10:21.220]   just 'cause it was the antithesis to organize team sports
[01:10:21.220 --> 01:10:23.360]   and mainstream culture.
[01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:24.980]   And so it was just like, yeah, this is what we do.
[01:10:24.980 --> 01:10:25.820]   Fuck it, who cares?
[01:10:25.820 --> 01:10:28.080]   Like we drink and we skate and everyone,
[01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:31.340]   it was wild west, right?
[01:10:31.340 --> 01:10:35.520]   But as I never fell into that deeply
[01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:38.880]   because I saw how it affected people's performances
[01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:42.420]   and the skating itself was paramount to me.
[01:10:42.420 --> 01:10:43.680]   That is what I wanted to focus on.
[01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:45.000]   That's what I wanted to be good at.
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:48.440]   And I saw people partying and partying their skills away.
[01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:51.200]   So I had at least that forethought.
[01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:57.300]   And then as skating got more established, popular,
[01:10:57.300 --> 01:11:01.520]   more of a career option, then people started
[01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:04.520]   taking it more seriously, especially competitors.
[01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:08.520]   But there's such a wide swath of what skateboarding is
[01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:09.640]   and it's a big tent.
[01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:12.680]   So to say that it's more organized,
[01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:14.080]   yes, it's more organized over here.
[01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:17.200]   There's still all these skaters over here partying,
[01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:20.360]   hopping fences, don't care about contests,
[01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:21.380]   don't want sponsors.
[01:11:21.380 --> 01:11:23.360]   - Oh, well like GX 1000, like those kids
[01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:24.940]   that bomb hills in San Francisco.
[01:11:24.940 --> 01:11:29.240]   - But that's what I love about it is the diversity of it all.
[01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:32.240]   And that's, we're all part of this scene.
[01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:37.240]   So I was a competitor, that was my path to success.
[01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:40.720]   And so I appreciate that people take it more seriously now
[01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:43.520]   and that they do have trainers, they have resources.
[01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:45.120]   I mean, they have sponsors that will pay
[01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:46.240]   for this kind of stuff.
[01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:48.700]   There was no such thing.
[01:11:48.700 --> 01:11:51.520]   I mean, like at our biggest skate contest,
[01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:55.040]   we were all staying at Stacey Peralta's parents' house
[01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:58.860]   the night before and he would take us out to get spaghetti
[01:11:58.860 --> 01:12:00.260]   because he thought carbohydrates
[01:12:00.260 --> 01:12:02.260]   was going to give us energy the next day.
[01:12:02.260 --> 01:12:07.260]   That was the extent of training in 1983, right?
[01:12:07.260 --> 01:12:12.540]   But nowadays we're treated like high elite athletes
[01:12:12.540 --> 01:12:17.260]   because they are like, if you really look at people
[01:12:17.260 --> 01:12:20.860]   that are at the top of their field, people like Naija Houston
[01:12:20.860 --> 01:12:21.700]   you know what I mean?
[01:12:21.700 --> 01:12:22.820]   Like the dude is a machine.
[01:12:22.820 --> 01:12:26.340]   He is one of the most precise skaters
[01:12:26.340 --> 01:12:29.340]   that we've ever seen or precise athletes.
[01:12:29.340 --> 01:12:34.340]   The side of Naija Comaneche, yes, I'm aging myself.
[01:12:34.340 --> 01:12:41.100]   But what I'm saying is like, this takes hardcore dedication,
[01:12:41.100 --> 01:12:47.660]   precision, athleticism, and devotion.
[01:12:47.660 --> 01:12:50.220]   And so now they have the resources to back that up
[01:12:50.220 --> 01:12:52.220]   and to keep it going longer.
[01:12:52.220 --> 01:12:55.140]   I mean, yeah, would I be able to do this now,
[01:12:55.140 --> 01:12:57.660]   especially after getting hurt without the help
[01:12:57.660 --> 01:13:01.220]   of a doctor of physical training?
[01:13:01.220 --> 01:13:02.700]   Probably not.
[01:13:02.700 --> 01:13:05.700]   I do it on some level, but I wouldn't get to where I am now.
[01:13:05.700 --> 01:13:09.140]   And so, hey, I think it's awesome.
[01:13:09.140 --> 01:13:14.060]   I never wanted to covet skateboarding as this thing
[01:13:14.060 --> 01:13:15.980]   that no one else, like a gatekeeper to it.
[01:13:15.980 --> 01:13:17.300]   No one else can touch it.
[01:13:17.300 --> 01:13:19.100]   I always thought there was something in skateboarding
[01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:23.740]   that was magical and that was good for mental health
[01:13:23.740 --> 01:13:28.740]   and that was required such passion.
[01:13:28.740 --> 01:13:35.440]   And I never understood why I didn't get bigger
[01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:38.020]   through those lean years.
[01:13:38.020 --> 01:13:40.020]   It was always like, this speaks to kids.
[01:13:40.020 --> 01:13:44.080]   Like it's daredevil and it's active and it's exciting
[01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:46.620]   and you can do it as a group, but you can do it your own way
[01:13:46.620 --> 01:13:48.320]   and I don't know, all those things,
[01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:51.360]   it took a long time for everyone else to figure it out.
[01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:52.280]   They definitely figured it out.
[01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:55.200]   I mean, nowadays, skaters are the cool kids in school.
[01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:56.940]   - Yeah, it's in the Olympics.
[01:13:56.940 --> 01:13:58.180]   There was always discussion, would it be,
[01:13:58.180 --> 01:14:00.180]   it was an exhibition sport in the Olympics at one point.
[01:14:00.180 --> 01:14:01.320]   - No. - No?
[01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:02.900]   - No. - Oh, I thought it was.
[01:14:02.900 --> 01:14:05.820]   Maybe it had a run at potentially being an exhibition sport.
[01:14:05.820 --> 01:14:08.760]   - There was talk of that. - Got it, got it.
[01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:13.760]   - But it never did and not that, I mean, at some point,
[01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:16.700]   especially in the late '90s, early 2000s,
[01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:21.140]   skating was getting appreciated
[01:14:21.140 --> 01:14:25.800]   and kind of reached that threshold of, is it mainstream?
[01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:28.100]   Well, it's on McDonald's commercials,
[01:14:28.100 --> 01:14:29.780]   so I guess that's pretty mainstream
[01:14:29.780 --> 01:14:31.540]   and so we already had come of age
[01:14:31.540 --> 01:14:33.860]   and it was like, we don't need the Olympics.
[01:14:33.860 --> 01:14:35.420]   We're already more popular
[01:14:35.420 --> 01:14:39.180]   than a lot of Olympic sports, right?
[01:14:39.180 --> 01:14:40.940]   So why do we need their validation?
[01:14:40.940 --> 01:14:42.020]   And then at some point it became
[01:14:42.020 --> 01:14:45.260]   like the power dynamic shifted and it was like,
[01:14:45.260 --> 01:14:47.760]   oh, they need our cool factor.
[01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:49.580]   We don't need their validation.
[01:14:49.580 --> 01:14:52.020]   And it was like, yeah, okay, you guys want it?
[01:14:52.020 --> 01:14:56.500]   Sure, go ahead, hold the events, hold the qualifiers.
[01:14:56.500 --> 01:15:01.200]   We'll participate, but we don't need this.
[01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:05.840]   - Well, you've been an amazing ambassador for the sport
[01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:09.320]   that's driven so much of that wider acceptance
[01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:12.580]   and progression and invitation into different domains.
[01:15:12.580 --> 01:15:15.380]   One of the things that I definitely want to talk about
[01:15:15.380 --> 01:15:17.220]   is the video game, right?
[01:15:17.220 --> 01:15:21.440]   Because I think that the video game changed a lot of things
[01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:23.000]   for the general public
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.700]   in terms of their perception of skateboarding.
[01:15:25.700 --> 01:15:29.000]   I mean, what it allowed of course is, this is obvious,
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:32.220]   but it allowed kids that weren't going to, you know,
[01:15:32.220 --> 01:15:35.760]   bang up their shins or walk in with a broken wrist
[01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:38.680]   or, you know, all skinned up to do incredible tricks,
[01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:41.320]   but in silico on a screen, right?
[01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:44.720]   And to pretend that they are the pro skateboarder.
[01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:47.340]   This is actually what video games are about.
[01:15:47.340 --> 01:15:49.940]   And yet when you can see something,
[01:15:49.940 --> 01:15:52.460]   just like you can imagine it in a dream
[01:15:52.460 --> 01:15:53.900]   or while you're falling asleep,
[01:15:53.900 --> 01:15:56.340]   and you can see something and hear an air quotes,
[01:15:56.340 --> 01:15:57.900]   do something in a video game,
[01:15:57.900 --> 01:16:00.520]   it also is going to inspire a number of kids to go outside
[01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:03.180]   and grab a real skateboard and try that
[01:16:03.180 --> 01:16:04.740]   or try something like that.
[01:16:04.740 --> 01:16:06.660]   So clearly the video game was a catalyst
[01:16:06.660 --> 01:16:10.260]   for what I consider now the wide acceptance of skateboarding
[01:16:10.260 --> 01:16:12.980]   as a sport in all its various forms.
[01:16:12.980 --> 01:16:15.760]   - Could you just talk for a little bit about the genesis
[01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:16.600]   of the video game?
[01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:19.240]   Were you into video games prior to the video game?
[01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:22.440]   Were you into technology generally?
[01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:25.360]   And what sort of motivated the interest in the video game?
[01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:28.240]   Because it certainly has changed the face
[01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:29.400]   of actual skateboarding
[01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:31.160]   and the perception of skateboarding.
[01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:34.720]   - Well, I've been into video games since the get-go.
[01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:37.560]   I mean, I was a kid, you know, playing Pong, Pac-Man,
[01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:40.120]   Missile Command, Q*bert, you name it.
[01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:43.300]   And then getting the home systems in television,
[01:16:43.300 --> 01:16:47.340]   Super NES, Commodore 64.
[01:16:47.340 --> 01:16:48.400]   - Sega.
[01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:49.240]   - Sega, yeah.
[01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:52.620]   But I, and I always loved technology.
[01:16:52.620 --> 01:16:57.620]   So when I finally started making money in the '80s,
[01:16:57.620 --> 01:17:01.560]   my first kind of big purchase in terms of that,
[01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:07.380]   in terms of electronics was a Commodore Amiga,
[01:17:07.380 --> 01:17:12.000]   which was considered one of the highest end home computers,
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:15.060]   you know, alongside Mac, but more graphic oriented
[01:17:15.060 --> 01:17:16.520]   and more game oriented.
[01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:19.720]   And so I was always into that idea
[01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:21.460]   that you could do this kind of stuff at home,
[01:17:21.460 --> 01:17:22.620]   not just in arcades.
[01:17:22.620 --> 01:17:28.520]   And then I got a call from a PC programmer
[01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:31.280]   that wanted to pitch a skate game
[01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:34.880]   and had a crude engine of a skater
[01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:37.900]   that would cruise around, go in bowls and stuff like that.
[01:17:37.900 --> 01:17:40.280]   And it was all keyboard controlled, it was clunky,
[01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:41.700]   but it was something.
[01:17:41.700 --> 01:17:44.580]   And the last thing that we had as skating
[01:17:44.580 --> 01:17:49.580]   was 720 in the arcade or Skate or Die
[01:17:49.580 --> 01:17:51.740]   for home systems for Commodore 64.
[01:17:51.740 --> 01:17:53.580]   That was like the last thing that had happened
[01:17:53.580 --> 01:17:55.860]   for skateboarding in video games.
[01:17:55.860 --> 01:17:58.820]   And so I went with him, I was excited to get,
[01:17:58.820 --> 01:18:02.880]   like I got to, we got to go to Nintendo and pitch it.
[01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:04.860]   We went to Midway, you know,
[01:18:04.860 --> 01:18:07.440]   we went to all these different console
[01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:11.520]   and software manufacturers and we're just told
[01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:13.320]   that this is a bad idea.
[01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:15.240]   Skateboarding is not popular.
[01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:17.480]   Home video games are barely a thing.
[01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:20.160]   Why would anyone want to buy a video game
[01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:21.600]   about skateboarding?
[01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:25.580]   Someone said those exact words to me at Midway.
[01:18:25.580 --> 01:18:30.280]   And so he got frustrated and he needed to find a job
[01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:32.640]   and I was just kind of free floating.
[01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:35.560]   So I said, okay, he goes, well, I'm not gonna do this,
[01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:38.280]   but I feel like you've established yourself,
[01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:40.920]   at least in the video game world,
[01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:42.860]   industry that you're interested in doing something.
[01:18:42.860 --> 01:18:44.360]   So maybe if someone does something, they'll call you.
[01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:46.720]   And I was like, yeah, right, sure.
[01:18:46.720 --> 01:18:49.640]   Sure enough, like a year later, Activision called me
[01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:52.020]   and they said, hey, we heard you want to do a video game.
[01:18:52.020 --> 01:18:55.680]   I said, well, yes, I would love to work on a video game.
[01:18:55.680 --> 01:18:57.640]   I'm not a programmer or anything.
[01:18:57.640 --> 01:18:59.060]   So we have something we're working on
[01:18:59.060 --> 01:19:00.660]   I would like to show it to you.
[01:19:00.660 --> 01:19:02.840]   And so I went up to Activision.
[01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:06.120]   They were working on a skate game,
[01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:08.040]   but it was based on an engine of a game
[01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:09.800]   that was already released called Apocalypse
[01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:11.120]   starring Bruce Willis.
[01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:14.480]   So the first version of my game was Bruce Willis
[01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:18.020]   on a skateboard with a gun strapped to his back
[01:19:18.020 --> 01:19:21.520]   in a desert wasteland doing kick flips.
[01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:23.720]   And it was awesome.
[01:19:23.720 --> 01:19:27.880]   It was truly like I picked it up and I got past that visual
[01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:31.480]   and then I started playing it and it was intuitive.
[01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:34.300]   The motion felt right, the engine was right.
[01:19:34.300 --> 01:19:39.300]   And I was like, this is the baseline of something special.
[01:19:39.300 --> 01:19:41.700]   I didn't think it was gonna be some big hit.
[01:19:41.700 --> 01:19:44.620]   I just thought, this is gonna be appreciated
[01:19:44.620 --> 01:19:46.000]   by skateboarders.
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:50.840]   And that was my goal the entire development process,
[01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:53.820]   which was about a year and a half after I signed on.
[01:19:53.820 --> 01:19:56.460]   Through that year and a half, we were going back and forth
[01:19:56.460 --> 01:19:59.360]   with, they would FedEx me builds on CDs.
[01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:01.920]   I had a modified PlayStation and I would play it,
[01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:04.840]   make notes and I thought, man, skater's gonna dig this.
[01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:05.680]   And that was it.
[01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:07.580]   And skating wasn't even that popular.
[01:20:07.580 --> 01:20:11.720]   It was coming to, it was starting to get some traction.
[01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:12.820]   - What year was this again?
[01:20:12.820 --> 01:20:14.180]   - Like '98.
[01:20:14.180 --> 01:20:17.400]   So it was like X Games were starting to come into the fold.
[01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:19.740]   People were taking note of what skateboarding had become
[01:20:19.740 --> 01:20:21.040]   at that point.
[01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:23.980]   And then I thought, this is gonna be cool.
[01:20:23.980 --> 01:20:25.120]   Skater's gonna like it.
[01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:29.800]   And then not long before the release,
[01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:30.920]   they called me and they said,
[01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:34.720]   "Hey, we wanna offer you a buyout of future royalties
[01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:35.680]   for this game.
[01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:39.120]   'Cause I think people are gonna like it."
[01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:40.840]   And I was like, what does that mean?
[01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:42.800]   They go, "We'll give you a half a million dollars
[01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:46.080]   and then you don't get royalties going forward,
[01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:48.280]   but you get that money upfront."
[01:20:48.280 --> 01:20:51.600]   And at that time in my life,
[01:20:51.600 --> 01:20:53.000]   to hear someone say half a million dollars
[01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:56.200]   seriously sounded like a half a billion dollars.
[01:20:56.200 --> 01:21:00.600]   Like no one had ever talked about numbers that big to me.
[01:21:00.600 --> 01:21:03.960]   - Well, also '98 was a little bit of a quiet time
[01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:05.360]   for vert skateboarding too, right?
[01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:06.200]   - Sure, yeah.
[01:21:06.200 --> 01:21:07.760]   Skateboarding in general, but yeah.
[01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:13.660]   Luckily vert skating still was a thing
[01:21:13.660 --> 01:21:15.380]   because of inline skating.
[01:21:15.380 --> 01:21:18.120]   Because inline skating was huge, right?
[01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:19.360]   Late '90s.
[01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:20.960]   And they were all vert.
[01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:25.120]   And so we as skaters got to sort of ride those coattails
[01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:26.440]   'cause it was like, "Hey, there are vert ramps
[01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:28.760]   'cause everyone's rollerblading."
[01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:30.040]   - I forgot about that.
[01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:30.880]   - That did.
[01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:33.000]   And I have, honestly, I was the special guest
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:36.680]   at a couple of inline rollerblade shows
[01:21:36.680 --> 01:21:38.600]   where it was like, "This is Team Rollerblade Live
[01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:40.480]   and special guest, Tony Hawk, the skateboarder."
[01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:43.440]   And I was like, "Hey, hi, all right, dropping in."
[01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:44.480]   But it paid the bills.
[01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:45.840]   - Yeah.
[01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:50.840]   - So to answer from what you're saying,
[01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:54.700]   vert skating was a thing at least established
[01:21:54.700 --> 01:21:57.320]   in the ex-skaters, which was something
[01:21:57.320 --> 01:21:59.160]   and enough for us to make a living.
[01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:02.600]   So when they offered me this money,
[01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:06.020]   I actually was in a pretty good place
[01:22:06.020 --> 01:22:10.040]   in terms of my, I don't know, my options,
[01:22:10.040 --> 01:22:13.520]   my trajectory and I felt like,
[01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:17.000]   and I had just bought a new home and I thought,
[01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:20.160]   "I'm gonna take a chance and just see what happens."
[01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:24.000]   And that was the best financial decision I ever made.
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:24.920]   - Took the equity.
[01:22:24.920 --> 01:22:27.840]   - Yeah, I just let it ride.
[01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:29.660]   I was like, "No, I wanna see what happens with this."
[01:22:29.660 --> 01:22:32.560]   And as soon as the game was released,
[01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:35.240]   it was getting stellar reviews.
[01:22:35.240 --> 01:22:38.640]   And then I remember like the very next week
[01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:41.320]   after it was released, never stopped saying,
[01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:42.400]   "Okay, we're working on number two.
[01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:44.000]   What do you wanna do?"
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:45.340]   Like, "What do you mean?"
[01:22:45.340 --> 01:22:46.780]   "Well, yeah, we're doing a sequel."
[01:22:46.780 --> 01:22:47.620]   "Wait, what?
[01:22:47.620 --> 01:22:49.880]   Awesome."
[01:22:49.880 --> 01:22:52.360]   And then we ended up doing like 10.
[01:22:52.360 --> 01:22:53.720]   - Amazing. - Crazy.
[01:22:53.720 --> 01:22:54.560]   - Amazing.
[01:22:54.560 --> 01:22:59.160]   I'm thinking about your decision to not take the cash
[01:22:59.160 --> 01:23:00.840]   and to see how it would go.
[01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:04.940]   I'm thinking about your decision to buy a car at 16
[01:23:04.940 --> 01:23:07.160]   and as a consequence get pulled over
[01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:08.600]   'cause you looked younger.
[01:23:08.600 --> 01:23:11.360]   I'm thinking about the time when
[01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:13.840]   through the graciousness of your parents who took me in
[01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:16.400]   'cause I had no money to get back up to Northern California
[01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:18.920]   and they couldn't get ahold of my mom.
[01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:19.840]   They took me to your home,
[01:23:19.840 --> 01:23:23.020]   but then they took me to where you were living the next day,
[01:23:23.020 --> 01:23:24.380]   which was in Fallbrook.
[01:23:24.380 --> 01:23:26.280]   You don't remember this, but I do.
[01:23:26.280 --> 01:23:27.840]   And I know you've heard this story before.
[01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:29.820]   So forgive me because most people listening haven't.
[01:23:29.820 --> 01:23:32.120]   But I remember getting driven up to Fallbrook.
[01:23:32.120 --> 01:23:34.080]   You had the ramps in your backyard.
[01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:36.780]   I walked in, got introduced to you.
[01:23:36.780 --> 01:23:38.840]   You were very gracious, said, "Hello, what's up?"
[01:23:38.840 --> 01:23:40.740]   Said, "Feel free to push around on the ramps outside."
[01:23:40.740 --> 01:23:42.080]   It was the mini, it was a spine ramp.
[01:23:42.080 --> 01:23:43.640]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:23:43.640 --> 01:23:45.760]   Two ramps back to back folks, spine.
[01:23:45.760 --> 01:23:47.760]   Sorry, nomenclature.
[01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:50.200]   I think Ray Underhill was there.
[01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:51.320]   - Yeah, he lived there for a while.
[01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:52.360]   - Yeah, and as I recall,
[01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:55.080]   you had pretty vast music collection
[01:23:55.080 --> 01:23:56.480]   and we'll talk about music.
[01:23:56.480 --> 01:24:00.760]   But it also seemed that there was a couple of cars
[01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:02.040]   in the driveway and whatnot,
[01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:05.240]   but it's clear to me based on a number of things
[01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:07.560]   and that interaction and what I observed there
[01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:10.440]   that either you had someone in your ear,
[01:24:10.440 --> 01:24:12.560]   either your dad or your mom or both,
[01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:13.920]   or maybe it had been Stacy,
[01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:17.160]   or maybe it was somebody else who was advising you
[01:24:17.160 --> 01:24:19.440]   to make very good financial decisions,
[01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:21.380]   like not spend all your money
[01:24:21.380 --> 01:24:26.060]   or continue to spend all your money to invest in things,
[01:24:26.060 --> 01:24:29.240]   or maybe it was just instilled in you at a young age.
[01:24:29.240 --> 01:24:30.660]   Who knows?
[01:24:30.660 --> 01:24:33.820]   I'm asking because I think so many people
[01:24:33.820 --> 01:24:36.140]   burn their early success,
[01:24:36.140 --> 01:24:38.680]   what represents a lot of wealth for them early on,
[01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:41.280]   they burn that where they start making just bad decisions.
[01:24:41.280 --> 01:24:43.200]   You explained before why you tended
[01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:45.200]   to avoid drugs and alcohol,
[01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:48.160]   and certainly any severe relationship to drugs or alcohol
[01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:50.480]   that would keep you from progressing and skateboarding.
[01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:54.240]   But the ability to make really good decisions
[01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:59.240]   as a young, famous athlete is more rare than it is common,
[01:24:59.240 --> 01:25:03.120]   even when people have coaches.
[01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:06.280]   So I'm curious, where did that shrewdness
[01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:07.860]   and that prudence come from?
[01:25:07.860 --> 01:25:09.160]   And was Frank, your dad,
[01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:11.520]   and maybe Nancy also advising you all along,
[01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:14.800]   like, hey, think smart, be smart,
[01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:18.220]   because clearly you've made some very smart decisions.
[01:25:18.220 --> 01:25:22.840]   - He was definitely a guide in it.
[01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:24.640]   He was the first one who said,
[01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:27.380]   you should probably buy real estate.
[01:25:27.380 --> 01:25:29.840]   I was 17, so I didn't even know that was possible,
[01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:31.940]   but he co-signed and made it possible.
[01:25:31.940 --> 01:25:34.320]   But then after that,
[01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:37.880]   I ended up buying that home that you went to,
[01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:39.720]   and it was four acre property,
[01:25:39.720 --> 01:25:41.280]   and we built these ramps on it.
[01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:46.280]   And that was amazing and definitely helped propel my skating
[01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:49.200]   to a different level than I ever imagined.
[01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:53.320]   But at some point that was just a drain,
[01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:55.360]   and it was a drain financially,
[01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:57.000]   and I was living beyond my means,
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:58.440]   and my income kept dropping,
[01:25:58.440 --> 01:26:01.800]   'cause we're talking about not long after that was '91, '92,
[01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:04.380]   the slowest days of skating.
[01:26:04.380 --> 01:26:06.840]   And I've got this giant mortgage,
[01:26:06.840 --> 01:26:08.440]   and I've got this property and these ramps
[01:26:08.440 --> 01:26:10.720]   that I can't afford to upkeep.
[01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:13.920]   I can barely afford my water bill at one point.
[01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:18.240]   You know, and so what you saw might've seemed stable,
[01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:21.320]   but behind the scenes, it was starting to unravel.
[01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:22.600]   - Birdhouse hadn't been started.
[01:26:22.600 --> 01:26:24.440]   - Birdhouse was started in '92,
[01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:26.520]   and when I started Birdhouse,
[01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:30.020]   I took the equity from that house to start it,
[01:26:30.020 --> 01:26:32.400]   'cause I burned through my savings
[01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:35.160]   from trying to keep this place going.
[01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:37.480]   So I took a second mortgage out on that house,
[01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:40.520]   or I took my equity out, started Birdhouse,
[01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:43.840]   sold the house for what I had taken out,
[01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:46.560]   and then moved to my original place
[01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:48.720]   that I had when I was in high school,
[01:26:48.720 --> 01:26:53.160]   and just pulled back on expenses.
[01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:56.220]   I think that was when I really became shrewd,
[01:26:56.220 --> 01:26:58.040]   because I had to.
[01:26:58.040 --> 01:27:00.680]   I had a first child.
[01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:05.680]   I had an income that was very uncertain, very fluctuating,
[01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:09.880]   and I was just eating Taco Bell and Top Ramen
[01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:11.840]   and peanut bread and jelly sandwiches,
[01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:16.840]   and not spending anything, and taking every job,
[01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:19.920]   like the most random demo requests,
[01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:23.240]   or we want you to be a consultant on this commercial,
[01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:25.000]   because I'm 24.
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.960]   I'm too old to be the guy skating,
[01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:29.600]   'cause it has to be youth, right?
[01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:31.160]   But they're like, well, we wanna see what's possible,
[01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:33.600]   so can you come up the day before and show us the ropes?
[01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:37.960]   And so I would be the stunt skater that's filling in
[01:27:37.960 --> 01:27:39.440]   to show them the angles and stuff,
[01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:43.760]   and then they would go hire Chet Thomas as the young kid,
[01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:44.700]   and then I would stand around.
[01:27:44.700 --> 01:27:45.540]   I was getting paid.
[01:27:45.540 --> 01:27:46.360]   I didn't care.
[01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:47.540]   - I think I remember those commercials.
[01:27:47.540 --> 01:27:50.480]   Is it a cereal commercial or something like that?
[01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:55.000]   - The cereal commercial was Chris Miller, Frosted Flakes,
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:56.360]   and I was Tony the Tiger.
[01:27:56.360 --> 01:27:59.700]   So I was wearing a skin tight suit.
[01:27:59.700 --> 01:28:02.260]   - It's all the blonde SoCal guys, you, Chet, Chris.
[01:28:02.260 --> 01:28:04.040]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:07.240]   - Throughout the birdhouse, which is your company,
[01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:09.600]   but without telling people what is it, Skateboard Company.
[01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:12.440]   I remember Willie Santos was early on.
[01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:14.260]   I remember, he's a super nice kid.
[01:28:14.260 --> 01:28:15.280]   Used to see him at the contest.
[01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:18.200]   I remember thinking, whoa, Tony Hawk has his own company
[01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:19.040]   for skateboarders.
[01:28:19.040 --> 01:28:19.880]   That was revolutionary.
[01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:22.920]   - We had a team, you know, like Willie was a maestro.
[01:28:22.920 --> 01:28:28.240]   Jeremy Klein, legendary street pioneer.
[01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:30.760]   Steve Barra, who's kind of a, we called it ATV,
[01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:32.140]   but street anvert.
[01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:37.740]   We had Ocean Howell, who was like our number one amateur.
[01:28:37.740 --> 01:28:40.860]   We had Andrew Reynolds, Matt Beach.
[01:28:40.860 --> 01:28:43.960]   We had a team, it was full on.
[01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:48.320]   - Was it fun to move from rider to also rider,
[01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:50.400]   but team manager, owner?
[01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:51.600]   - Was it fun?
[01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:54.200]   It was just necessary.
[01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:55.160]   I can't say it was fun.
[01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:56.440]   I mean, yeah, it was fun,
[01:28:56.440 --> 01:28:59.840]   'cause we were still just kind of reckless
[01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:03.480]   and driving, you know, six of us in a van,
[01:29:03.480 --> 01:29:05.480]   driving to skate shops across the country
[01:29:05.480 --> 01:29:08.640]   and begging them for 300 bucks
[01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:10.920]   so that we could get gas and food and a hotel room
[01:29:10.920 --> 01:29:12.980]   and get on our way.
[01:29:12.980 --> 01:29:16.320]   I don't know.
[01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:19.920]   But for me, it just felt like a necessity to,
[01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:23.160]   that was what I had to do to make a brand happen.
[01:29:23.160 --> 01:29:24.720]   And so I was willing to do it.
[01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:29.200]   But it was exhausting.
[01:29:29.200 --> 01:29:34.200]   Yeah, 'cause I had to be the coach
[01:29:34.200 --> 01:29:38.180]   and the tour manager and the skater.
[01:29:38.180 --> 01:29:43.360]   I was putting myself out there on the worst conditions
[01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:46.480]   and just rolling my ankle left and right.
[01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:49.440]   And it was all street and it just wasn't my thing.
[01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:53.420]   It was hard, but I loved it, it made it happen.
[01:29:53.420 --> 01:29:55.540]   - In my mind, I'm thinking you had to be
[01:29:55.540 --> 01:29:59.740]   Tony Hawk, the skateboarder, Frank Hawk, the organizer,
[01:29:59.740 --> 01:30:04.060]   and Stacy Peralta, 'cause Stacy had been a pro skateboarder.
[01:30:04.060 --> 01:30:05.500]   I still think of him as a skateboarder,
[01:30:05.500 --> 01:30:07.060]   even though he's a filmmaker, right, skateboarder.
[01:30:07.060 --> 01:30:09.260]   Just like I still think of Spike Jones as a skateboarder,
[01:30:09.260 --> 01:30:12.100]   BMXer, filmmaker.
[01:30:12.100 --> 01:30:14.720]   It seems like you had to integrate all of those.
[01:30:14.720 --> 01:30:17.700]   And I mentioned that because I am curious.
[01:30:17.700 --> 01:30:20.180]   I think a lot of people are probably curious.
[01:30:20.180 --> 01:30:22.420]   Are you the type of person like sit back in a chair at night
[01:30:22.420 --> 01:30:24.320]   and think like, okay, like, how I'm gonna do this?
[01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:26.020]   I mean, are you contemplative
[01:30:26.020 --> 01:30:29.240]   or is it really you just identify what needs to be done
[01:30:29.240 --> 01:30:30.920]   this year and over the next three years
[01:30:30.920 --> 01:30:33.380]   and set your milestones kind of short in.
[01:30:33.380 --> 01:30:35.920]   - I guess now or back then. - Back then.
[01:30:35.920 --> 01:30:38.640]   - Oh no, everything was just in the moment.
[01:30:38.640 --> 01:30:40.160]   We gotta get here.
[01:30:40.160 --> 01:30:42.620]   We gotta get to Dallas by tomorrow.
[01:30:42.620 --> 01:30:43.980]   Like as soon as this demo's over,
[01:30:43.980 --> 01:30:45.380]   get in the van, we're going.
[01:30:45.380 --> 01:30:48.380]   We gotta get a hotel room.
[01:30:48.380 --> 01:30:51.960]   It was just stuff like that, it was very much.
[01:30:51.960 --> 01:30:56.960]   But I think I learned to respect punctuality
[01:30:56.960 --> 01:31:04.620]   because I travel with plenty of skaters that were not
[01:31:04.620 --> 01:31:06.940]   and didn't care and show up late and was like,
[01:31:06.940 --> 01:31:08.780]   dude, and like, I don't know these guys.
[01:31:08.780 --> 01:31:10.500]   And then when I was in charge, it was like,
[01:31:10.500 --> 01:31:11.780]   we're gonna be on time
[01:31:11.780 --> 01:31:14.340]   'cause we have to respect other people's time.
[01:31:14.340 --> 01:31:15.760]   And we said, we're gonna be here at three o'clock,
[01:31:15.760 --> 01:31:18.060]   we're gonna be here at three o'clock.
[01:31:18.060 --> 01:31:21.400]   And that's not easy with a skate crew.
[01:31:22.240 --> 01:31:23.640]   No, Mike Blaback, who as you know,
[01:31:23.640 --> 01:31:25.680]   is integral to the "Humor in Love" podcast.
[01:31:25.680 --> 01:31:26.520]   I talk about that.
[01:31:26.520 --> 01:31:30.760]   We've got some other guys that came over from DC
[01:31:30.760 --> 01:31:32.740]   to as filmmakers and editors for us.
[01:31:32.740 --> 01:31:36.080]   And they're so punctual and they're so on it.
[01:31:36.080 --> 01:31:38.500]   And I noticed you showed up early today, right?
[01:31:38.500 --> 01:31:42.640]   Right on time or early, early by five minutes.
[01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:45.440]   And that is a distinguishing factor, I think,
[01:31:45.440 --> 01:31:48.400]   in any occupation, but especially in skateboarding
[01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:50.040]   where there's this kind of looseness.
[01:31:50.040 --> 01:31:50.880]   - Sure.
[01:31:50.880 --> 01:31:54.380]   - So if you do show up on time, it really means a lot.
[01:31:54.380 --> 01:31:57.480]   The professionalism that was instilled in you,
[01:31:57.480 --> 01:32:00.420]   it's clear that different places where that's showing up,
[01:32:00.420 --> 01:32:02.820]   mentioned the shrewdness about the business decisions.
[01:32:02.820 --> 01:32:04.680]   I'm curious about another aspect of that,
[01:32:04.680 --> 01:32:06.060]   which is maybe a little more cryptic,
[01:32:06.060 --> 01:32:09.780]   which is whether or not it was the CD collection that I saw
[01:32:09.780 --> 01:32:14.100]   or your mention of the car, your interest in video games.
[01:32:14.100 --> 01:32:16.300]   It seems that one thing that you've done
[01:32:16.300 --> 01:32:18.100]   that a lot of guys that I knew,
[01:32:18.100 --> 01:32:20.000]   'cause back then, by the way, it was mostly guys now,
[01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:24.200]   so we said there were women doing it too, women and girls.
[01:32:24.200 --> 01:32:28.580]   It seems like you have a lot of other hobbies and interests,
[01:32:28.580 --> 01:32:32.180]   music and et cetera, but that we never heard about you
[01:32:32.180 --> 01:32:34.620]   getting distracted or pulled down those lines.
[01:32:34.620 --> 01:32:36.300]   We didn't hear about you going and surfing
[01:32:36.300 --> 01:32:39.380]   and getting hurt surfing so that you couldn't skate.
[01:32:39.380 --> 01:32:43.220]   We're getting really into motorcycles or racing cars, right?
[01:32:43.220 --> 01:32:46.980]   Some people went hard left out of skateboarding into that,
[01:32:46.980 --> 01:32:49.700]   like Ken Block, the late, great Ken Block,
[01:32:49.700 --> 01:32:51.120]   but that became his main thing.
[01:32:51.120 --> 01:32:54.840]   Seems like you knew that skateboarding was the main frame
[01:32:54.840 --> 01:32:56.000]   and stayed with that.
[01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.860]   And yet you have a lot of other interests.
[01:32:58.860 --> 01:33:02.700]   - Yeah, I think I, well, with other sports,
[01:33:02.700 --> 01:33:05.660]   especially like motocross,
[01:33:05.660 --> 01:33:08.420]   I have this huge respect for motocross.
[01:33:08.420 --> 01:33:09.580]   I think it's super exciting.
[01:33:09.580 --> 01:33:10.680]   I would love to do it.
[01:33:10.680 --> 01:33:14.340]   And I know that I would not escape unscathed.
[01:33:14.340 --> 01:33:16.580]   I would definitely want to learn the tricks,
[01:33:16.580 --> 01:33:19.040]   do whips and flips and whatever,
[01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:20.500]   and I'm going to get hurt.
[01:33:20.500 --> 01:33:24.400]   And I don't want to risk my skate career for that.
[01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:29.400]   So I purposely pulled away from that type of thing.
[01:33:29.400 --> 01:33:33.300]   The last knee surgery I had is because I overshot a jump
[01:33:33.300 --> 01:33:35.340]   in Mammoth on my snowboard.
[01:33:35.340 --> 01:33:37.400]   So that was the lesson.
[01:33:37.400 --> 01:33:39.300]   I was like, don't, what are you doing?
[01:33:39.300 --> 01:33:40.340]   - Just cruise.
[01:33:40.340 --> 01:33:42.860]   - Yeah, stay on the ground, hit the powder.
[01:33:42.860 --> 01:33:47.260]   Free ride with your bros because I learned my lesson.
[01:33:47.260 --> 01:33:50.000]   So yeah, you're right, but at the same time,
[01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:53.020]   like I still love going surfing and snowboarding.
[01:33:53.020 --> 01:33:55.600]   I don't do them as much, obviously,
[01:33:55.600 --> 01:34:00.600]   but those are part of what I did all growing up.
[01:34:00.600 --> 01:34:02.200]   And they're important to me.
[01:34:02.200 --> 01:34:06.080]   I did do a couple of celebrity car races,
[01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:07.100]   like a NASCAR race.
[01:34:07.100 --> 01:34:11.500]   And I totaled a car in the Long Beach Grand Prix
[01:34:11.500 --> 01:34:13.940]   'cause this dude ran me into the wall and it was like,
[01:34:13.940 --> 01:34:16.340]   well, that was fun, but I'm not,
[01:34:16.340 --> 01:34:21.340]   I don't have the bandwidth to get that serious about it.
[01:34:21.340 --> 01:34:23.180]   - And now you have a family, of course, too.
[01:34:23.180 --> 01:34:25.740]   - Of course, yeah, I mean, and those things,
[01:34:25.740 --> 01:34:29.860]   as fun as they are and as, I don't know,
[01:34:29.860 --> 01:34:34.740]   as sort of auxiliary as they are,
[01:34:34.740 --> 01:34:36.440]   they require a lot of time.
[01:34:36.440 --> 01:34:39.260]   I mean, just for instance, that Long Beach Grand Prix,
[01:34:39.260 --> 01:34:41.460]   they want you to go stay in Palmdale
[01:34:41.460 --> 01:34:44.060]   for like a week and a half and train
[01:34:44.060 --> 01:34:46.900]   and figure out how to truly know how to drive and be safe.
[01:34:46.900 --> 01:34:49.300]   And it's like, I don't, I ain't got time for that.
[01:34:49.300 --> 01:34:51.340]   - Yeah, that's time you're not skateboarding.
[01:34:51.340 --> 01:34:52.260]   - Or with your family.
[01:34:52.260 --> 01:34:53.100]   - Right.
[01:34:53.100 --> 01:34:53.920]   - Yeah.
[01:34:53.920 --> 01:34:55.100]   - Right, now I feel the same way.
[01:34:55.100 --> 01:34:57.740]   If I get pulled away from reading papers
[01:34:57.740 --> 01:35:01.140]   and prepping podcasts and reading the latest research
[01:35:01.140 --> 01:35:02.500]   and thinking about experiments we could do,
[01:35:02.500 --> 01:35:04.180]   then I, for more than a couple of days,
[01:35:04.180 --> 01:35:05.900]   I start feeling the itch.
[01:35:05.900 --> 01:35:07.300]   I have a feeling this stuff is programmed
[01:35:07.300 --> 01:35:08.700]   into one's nervous system after a while.
[01:35:08.700 --> 01:35:10.140]   Like you've been skateboarding for so long
[01:35:10.140 --> 01:35:11.980]   that if you go a few days,
[01:35:11.980 --> 01:35:13.920]   it probably just, your system is-
[01:35:13.920 --> 01:35:14.760]   - Oh, I get edgy.
[01:35:14.760 --> 01:35:16.180]   - It's like depriving you of water or something.
[01:35:16.180 --> 01:35:17.020]   - Oh yeah, for sure.
[01:35:17.020 --> 01:35:19.960]   I mean, well, just for instance,
[01:35:19.960 --> 01:35:25.000]   our ramp is being torn down on Sunday.
[01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:26.460]   Today is Friday.
[01:35:26.460 --> 01:35:28.660]   Our ramp is being torn down on Sunday at 10 a.m.
[01:35:28.660 --> 01:35:32.060]   to be moved to Salt Lake City for our big vert event.
[01:35:32.060 --> 01:35:33.900]   I'm going there at 8.30
[01:35:33.900 --> 01:35:35.940]   so I can get a session before it gets torn down.
[01:35:35.940 --> 01:35:36.780]   - I love it.
[01:35:36.780 --> 01:35:37.780]   - On Father's Day.
[01:35:37.780 --> 01:35:39.160]   That's my Father's Day.
[01:35:39.160 --> 01:35:41.300]   I'm going to work at 8.30 a.m. on Sunday.
[01:35:41.300 --> 01:35:42.140]   - I love it.
[01:35:43.240 --> 01:35:45.580]   - Speaking of family and lineage,
[01:35:45.580 --> 01:35:48.380]   tell us about your kids.
[01:35:48.380 --> 01:35:50.540]   You've got some talented skateboarders in your family
[01:35:50.540 --> 01:35:51.980]   besides yourself.
[01:35:51.980 --> 01:35:52.900]   - I do.
[01:35:52.900 --> 01:35:55.740]   Well, I have four of my own and I have two stepkids
[01:35:55.740 --> 01:35:57.540]   and they all skate.
[01:35:57.540 --> 01:36:00.080]   My daughter, not so much anymore,
[01:36:00.080 --> 01:36:04.460]   but all the boys, five boys, are all really into it.
[01:36:04.460 --> 01:36:06.760]   My oldest son is the most,
[01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:11.960]   he's the most prominent because he turned pro
[01:36:11.960 --> 01:36:15.820]   and has his own following,
[01:36:15.820 --> 01:36:18.620]   has a name for himself, Riley, and he's 30.
[01:36:18.620 --> 01:36:21.300]   - Yeah, he kills it on street.
[01:36:21.300 --> 01:36:22.220]   He's a big street skateboarder.
[01:36:22.220 --> 01:36:23.640]   - He does, yeah.
[01:36:23.640 --> 01:36:26.980]   But they're all good.
[01:36:26.980 --> 01:36:29.960]   They're all good skaters in their own ways.
[01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:32.340]   And it's so fun.
[01:36:32.340 --> 01:36:35.060]   I mean, I didn't,
[01:36:35.060 --> 01:36:37.400]   of course they're surrounded by it their whole life,
[01:36:37.400 --> 01:36:39.420]   especially Riley 'cause when he was young,
[01:36:39.420 --> 01:36:41.580]   I didn't really have the means to have childcare
[01:36:41.580 --> 01:36:42.420]   or whatever.
[01:36:42.420 --> 01:36:44.480]   So I just had to take him with me on tours and whatnot.
[01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:45.960]   So he was always around it.
[01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:48.080]   So he got good at it by default,
[01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:50.120]   but at some point started to shy away from it
[01:36:50.120 --> 01:36:54.580]   because he felt the pressure in my shadow.
[01:36:54.580 --> 01:36:56.340]   And it was like, I don't, this isn't fun.
[01:36:56.340 --> 01:36:58.440]   I don't, people expect me to be super good
[01:36:58.440 --> 01:36:59.480]   or I have to do this stuff.
[01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:01.480]   And so he went, shied away from it,
[01:37:01.480 --> 01:37:04.600]   but then found a bunch of his friends in high school
[01:37:04.600 --> 01:37:05.680]   and they love skating.
[01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:06.580]   He's still good at it.
[01:37:06.580 --> 01:37:10.200]   So he found his crew and they've all found their crews.
[01:37:10.780 --> 01:37:13.740]   Completely independent of me.
[01:37:13.740 --> 01:37:17.340]   And so when we go on vacation, for instance,
[01:37:17.340 --> 01:37:20.820]   we were, last year we were in, or two years ago,
[01:37:20.820 --> 01:37:22.300]   we were on the big island in Hawaii.
[01:37:22.300 --> 01:37:24.260]   They want to go to the skate parks.
[01:37:24.260 --> 01:37:27.380]   I don't want to go to the skate parks, I'm on vacation.
[01:37:27.380 --> 01:37:28.680]   - It's also a little harsh stuff.
[01:37:28.680 --> 01:37:30.060]   It's a great way to get hurt, right?
[01:37:30.060 --> 01:37:30.900]   - What's that?
[01:37:30.900 --> 01:37:31.720]   - Over in Hawaii. - Of course, yeah.
[01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:32.740]   - It's all weather worn.
[01:37:32.740 --> 01:37:34.100]   - Oh yeah, and it's not even my scene,
[01:37:34.100 --> 01:37:37.340]   but then so I go, I'm, so I'm their chauffeur
[01:37:37.340 --> 01:37:38.940]   and I'm their filmer.
[01:37:38.940 --> 01:37:39.780]   - I love it.
[01:37:39.780 --> 01:37:40.880]   - That's my vacation.
[01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:43.280]   But because they all love it so much, you know what I mean?
[01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:44.900]   And it just, it's so cool.
[01:37:44.900 --> 01:37:47.400]   Like, I mean, how could I ever ask for more?
[01:37:47.400 --> 01:37:48.240]   It's amazing.
[01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:51.120]   - Let's talk about Frank and Nancy a little bit,
[01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:53.760]   just 'cause I have this kind of odd connection
[01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:55.760]   to your family through those,
[01:37:55.760 --> 01:37:57.260]   this really two or three day interaction,
[01:37:57.260 --> 01:37:58.680]   changed my life forever.
[01:37:58.680 --> 01:38:02.460]   Meeting you was spectacular as a young skateboarding kid,
[01:38:02.460 --> 01:38:04.660]   but also just the idea that someone would literally
[01:38:04.660 --> 01:38:06.280]   take me into their home.
[01:38:06.280 --> 01:38:08.180]   I mean, they had every reason to not trust me.
[01:38:08.180 --> 01:38:10.280]   First of all, I was hanging out with Billy Waldman,
[01:38:10.280 --> 01:38:12.640]   no explanation needed, the people who knew Billy.
[01:38:12.640 --> 01:38:13.480]   I hope he's doing well.
[01:38:13.480 --> 01:38:14.300]   I haven't heard anything about him,
[01:38:14.300 --> 01:38:15.940]   but I hope he's doing well.
[01:38:15.940 --> 01:38:19.560]   But we were wild, but he basically took me into your home.
[01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:24.560]   He and Nancy took me in, you know, fed us or fed me.
[01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:28.440]   I had another friend with me and, you know,
[01:38:28.440 --> 01:38:32.240]   I just have to say, as you're describing your family,
[01:38:32.240 --> 01:38:33.920]   I can only imagine what it must've been like
[01:38:33.920 --> 01:38:36.240]   for Frank and Nancy to see you have your kids.
[01:38:36.240 --> 01:38:41.240]   Did they get to live long enough to see that Riley
[01:38:41.240 --> 01:38:42.860]   and your other kids were skateboarders?
[01:38:42.860 --> 01:38:45.280]   - My dad met Riley,
[01:38:45.280 --> 01:38:48.000]   but my dad passed away when Riley was two.
[01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:52.100]   So he's the only, one of my kids that he met.
[01:38:52.100 --> 01:38:56.580]   My older sibling had kids,
[01:38:56.580 --> 01:39:01.580]   so he met two of his other grandkids besides Riley.
[01:39:03.180 --> 01:39:06.860]   My mom got to see some of Riley's success,
[01:39:06.860 --> 01:39:09.860]   but she suffered from Alzheimer's dementia
[01:39:09.860 --> 01:39:12.020]   and so things slipped away.
[01:39:12.020 --> 01:39:17.020]   But I think that my dad would not believe
[01:39:17.020 --> 01:39:23.020]   that skateboarding is in the Olympics.
[01:39:23.020 --> 01:39:26.940]   To him, that is the top of the mountain
[01:39:26.940 --> 01:39:28.480]   because he was really into other sports.
[01:39:28.480 --> 01:39:29.320]   He loves sports.
[01:39:29.320 --> 01:39:30.160]   He loved the Olympics.
[01:39:30.160 --> 01:39:32.140]   He loved watching football.
[01:39:32.140 --> 01:39:33.780]   He loved watching baseball.
[01:39:33.780 --> 01:39:36.060]   He loved when the Olympics were on.
[01:39:36.060 --> 01:39:38.020]   He just, he loved the competition element
[01:39:38.020 --> 01:39:39.620]   and the hype of it.
[01:39:39.620 --> 01:39:41.620]   And I think there was part of him that felt like,
[01:39:41.620 --> 01:39:43.420]   why isn't skateboarding in this?
[01:39:43.420 --> 01:39:46.100]   You know, but he knew that there were so many hurdles
[01:39:46.100 --> 01:39:48.580]   to get through and so much more acceptance
[01:39:48.580 --> 01:39:49.980]   that needed to happen.
[01:39:49.980 --> 01:39:53.300]   And I don't think he imagined it would ever happen.
[01:39:53.300 --> 01:39:56.500]   - He was a special guy.
[01:39:56.500 --> 01:39:58.340]   I can still hear his voice.
[01:39:58.340 --> 01:39:59.700]   He was a very large guy too.
[01:39:59.700 --> 01:40:01.380]   I don't know if you, I was just smaller then.
[01:40:01.380 --> 01:40:03.120]   I definitely was smaller then.
[01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:05.620]   He had like a big presence.
[01:40:05.620 --> 01:40:08.500]   And I know I've told you this many times before.
[01:40:08.500 --> 01:40:09.780]   This is actually how we got reconnected.
[01:40:09.780 --> 01:40:10.900]   I sent you a direct message and said,
[01:40:10.900 --> 01:40:12.280]   "Hey, I met your parents.
[01:40:12.280 --> 01:40:13.780]   "In fact, they took me into your home
[01:40:13.780 --> 01:40:15.020]   "and I'm telling the truth
[01:40:15.020 --> 01:40:16.200]   "and you'll know I'm telling the truth
[01:40:16.200 --> 01:40:17.620]   "because they took me to dinner
[01:40:17.620 --> 01:40:20.660]   "and they ordered black coffee after dinner."
[01:40:20.660 --> 01:40:21.820]   And you know, for years,
[01:40:21.820 --> 01:40:23.540]   I would order black coffee after dinner.
[01:40:23.540 --> 01:40:25.180]   You know, as a kid, you're just so impressionable.
[01:40:25.180 --> 01:40:27.040]   These really nice people took me in.
[01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:28.860]   I was like, wow, this is what a really healthy family
[01:40:28.860 --> 01:40:29.860]   looks like.
[01:40:29.860 --> 01:40:32.820]   I'm grateful to have loving parents, always did,
[01:40:32.820 --> 01:40:34.900]   but I didn't have the healthy family structure.
[01:40:34.900 --> 01:40:35.740]   So for me, it was like,
[01:40:35.740 --> 01:40:38.020]   oh my goodness, these people drink black coffee after dinner.
[01:40:38.020 --> 01:40:39.820]   This must be what healthy families do.
[01:40:39.820 --> 01:40:41.780]   So by the way, folks, don't drink caffeine
[01:40:41.780 --> 01:40:42.960]   within eight hours of going to sleep.
[01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:43.800]   But-
[01:40:43.800 --> 01:40:46.340]   - Wait, I still do that.
[01:40:46.340 --> 01:40:49.120]   - But well, it doesn't seem to be holding you back.
[01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:52.900]   Individualized, but yeah,
[01:40:52.900 --> 01:40:56.180]   it's spectacular that this lineage of, you know,
[01:40:56.180 --> 01:40:58.760]   Frank to you, and I mentioned, and Nancy,
[01:40:58.760 --> 01:41:00.600]   because it seems like while she might not have been
[01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:02.500]   at the contest and running around setting up tables
[01:41:02.500 --> 01:41:05.120]   and doing all of it, like she clearly was supportive as well.
[01:41:05.120 --> 01:41:07.420]   - Oh, she was at a lot of the events too.
[01:41:07.420 --> 01:41:09.080]   I mean, they needed all hands on deck
[01:41:09.080 --> 01:41:11.900]   when it started getting big and no one was taking salaries.
[01:41:11.900 --> 01:41:13.460]   You know, that was the thing is that people thought like,
[01:41:13.460 --> 01:41:15.440]   oh, your dad's like cashing on,
[01:41:15.440 --> 01:41:18.500]   he never took up money for any of that.
[01:41:18.500 --> 01:41:20.720]   And he took so much shit.
[01:41:20.720 --> 01:41:21.560]   You know what I mean?
[01:41:21.560 --> 01:41:22.460]   He just, he just loved it.
[01:41:22.460 --> 01:41:23.740]   - It was for you.
[01:41:23.740 --> 01:41:24.580]   - Well, and-
[01:41:24.580 --> 01:41:25.420]   - I have to imagine he wouldn't have been there.
[01:41:25.420 --> 01:41:27.900]   - It was for me and it was also for the misfits
[01:41:27.900 --> 01:41:29.500]   that I surrounded myself with.
[01:41:29.500 --> 01:41:34.500]   And even though he was brash and he was like, you know,
[01:41:34.500 --> 01:41:37.880]   he was, I don't know, what's the word?
[01:41:37.880 --> 01:41:42.940]   He was foreboding and intimidating or whatever else.
[01:41:42.940 --> 01:41:46.360]   He did it for all those kids that were kind of lost.
[01:41:46.360 --> 01:41:48.920]   Like you, I mean, really like he loved
[01:41:48.920 --> 01:41:50.100]   that it brought them together,
[01:41:50.100 --> 01:41:51.740]   that it gave them a sense of self,
[01:41:51.740 --> 01:41:53.140]   it gave them a sense of purpose.
[01:41:53.140 --> 01:41:55.940]   He saw that because he was that.
[01:41:55.940 --> 01:41:58.620]   He really had a rough childhood.
[01:41:58.620 --> 01:42:01.540]   And he did everything he could through his adult life
[01:42:01.540 --> 01:42:03.620]   to make up for it with his own kids
[01:42:03.620 --> 01:42:06.420]   and with the kids that they surround themselves with.
[01:42:06.420 --> 01:42:08.460]   So that's what he loved about it.
[01:42:08.460 --> 01:42:10.800]   Of course he loved seeing me thrive too,
[01:42:10.800 --> 01:42:13.360]   but he loved that he created the safe space
[01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:16.220]   and this sense of community.
[01:42:16.220 --> 01:42:18.500]   And so my mom, my mom was, that was her thing,
[01:42:18.500 --> 01:42:22.380]   was getting people together, gatherings.
[01:42:22.380 --> 01:42:24.700]   You know, oh, we should all get together.
[01:42:24.700 --> 01:42:27.820]   And like, even my siblings and I,
[01:42:27.820 --> 01:42:31.020]   as much as we want to emulate our parents,
[01:42:31.020 --> 01:42:33.060]   we don't do it as much as they did.
[01:42:33.060 --> 01:42:34.020]   And we regret that.
[01:42:34.020 --> 01:42:36.160]   - Well, there's still time.
[01:42:36.160 --> 01:42:38.820]   - No, I mean, we do, but it's tricky.
[01:42:38.820 --> 01:42:39.980]   We're all in different areas.
[01:42:39.980 --> 01:42:40.900]   - Sure.
[01:42:40.900 --> 01:42:42.420]   Yeah, the person that comes to mind
[01:42:42.420 --> 01:42:43.780]   when I think about your dad,
[01:42:43.780 --> 01:42:44.840]   now I'm forgetting the movie,
[01:42:44.840 --> 01:42:46.540]   but there's this one Clint Eastwood movie
[01:42:46.540 --> 01:42:49.220]   where he lives in a neighborhood
[01:42:49.220 --> 01:42:53.020]   where I think it's a bunch of young Hmong gangsters.
[01:42:53.020 --> 01:42:53.860]   - El Camino.
[01:42:53.860 --> 01:42:54.700]   - El Camino.
[01:42:54.700 --> 01:42:55.520]   - Yeah.
[01:42:55.520 --> 01:42:56.900]   - And I just remember there's that scene
[01:42:56.900 --> 01:42:58.660]   of Clint coming out on his porch
[01:42:58.660 --> 01:43:00.680]   and just standing really upright,
[01:43:00.680 --> 01:43:04.700]   everything in his front lawn, everything super manicured
[01:43:04.700 --> 01:43:06.740]   and just standing there like this immense presence.
[01:43:06.740 --> 01:43:08.620]   And that's how I remember Frank Hawk.
[01:43:08.620 --> 01:43:10.740]   - Yeah, but he was a total softie.
[01:43:10.740 --> 01:43:12.600]   That's the thing.
[01:43:12.600 --> 01:43:16.440]   That's the, you know, there was a, it was all a front.
[01:43:16.440 --> 01:43:20.100]   - Well, he was certainly very gracious.
[01:43:20.100 --> 01:43:23.220]   - Like, you know, you got to see that side of him
[01:43:23.220 --> 01:43:26.420]   where it's just like, oh yeah, come on, we'll take you out.
[01:43:26.420 --> 01:43:28.260]   You want to go see Tony's place, let's go.
[01:43:28.260 --> 01:43:30.580]   Like, that's not some hard ass.
[01:43:30.580 --> 01:43:33.500]   - Well, there's a tail end to the story too,
[01:43:33.500 --> 01:43:36.100]   where he actually called my mom.
[01:43:36.100 --> 01:43:38.420]   And I think there may have been a statement or two about,
[01:43:38.420 --> 01:43:39.540]   hey, this kid's 14.
[01:43:39.540 --> 01:43:41.180]   Like he can't be in Linda Vista Boys Club
[01:43:41.180 --> 01:43:43.780]   taking the bus back to Lancaster, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:43:43.780 --> 01:43:45.820]   May have been some discussion like that,
[01:43:45.820 --> 01:43:48.500]   but then they also paid for me to go home.
[01:43:48.500 --> 01:43:49.320]   - Oh yeah.
[01:43:49.320 --> 01:43:50.420]   - They flew me home.
[01:43:50.420 --> 01:43:51.260]   - Yeah.
[01:43:51.260 --> 01:43:52.540]   - So I think I owe you a couple of hundred bucks
[01:43:52.540 --> 01:43:55.120]   for a Southwest flight or whatever airline it was.
[01:43:55.120 --> 01:43:56.860]   Well, it's fun.
[01:43:56.860 --> 01:43:59.060]   And I think important to reminisce about these people
[01:43:59.060 --> 01:44:01.620]   because they aren't just your parents,
[01:44:01.620 --> 01:44:03.100]   but they've done so much.
[01:44:03.100 --> 01:44:06.960]   And through you, you know, I really think that emotions
[01:44:06.960 --> 01:44:09.460]   and stories are really like the equivalent
[01:44:09.460 --> 01:44:10.900]   of energy in humans.
[01:44:10.900 --> 01:44:11.880]   You know, when people talk about energy,
[01:44:11.880 --> 01:44:13.580]   because that gets carried forward.
[01:44:13.580 --> 01:44:17.780]   Speaking of which, we share a common love
[01:44:17.780 --> 01:44:19.420]   of some particular music.
[01:44:19.420 --> 01:44:21.180]   Are you somebody who listens to music
[01:44:21.180 --> 01:44:25.600]   to sort of to inspire you to get amped up to go skateboard?
[01:44:25.600 --> 01:44:27.860]   Is music an important part of your life?
[01:44:27.860 --> 01:44:29.140]   - Yeah, let's put it this way.
[01:44:29.140 --> 01:44:33.720]   I had a playlist for my 540 the other day.
[01:44:33.720 --> 01:44:34.820]   - Okay.
[01:44:34.820 --> 01:44:36.620]   - Fine tune to that trick
[01:44:36.620 --> 01:44:41.380]   and what would get me motivated and hyped to do it.
[01:44:41.380 --> 01:44:43.280]   - You don't have to share with us what's on the playlist
[01:44:43.280 --> 01:44:44.980]   unless you choose to.
[01:44:44.980 --> 01:44:45.820]   - Oh man.
[01:44:45.820 --> 01:44:47.060]   - But was it high energy, low energy?
[01:44:47.060 --> 01:44:50.180]   - High energy, well, and some meaningful songs
[01:44:50.180 --> 01:44:54.980]   like New Order Ceremony and let's see,
[01:44:54.980 --> 01:44:56.740]   Nine Inch Nails getting smaller
[01:44:56.740 --> 01:44:58.720]   because that was a song we used
[01:44:58.720 --> 01:45:00.300]   in one of our big skate tours
[01:45:00.300 --> 01:45:03.500]   and it was one of the most high energy sections of the show.
[01:45:03.500 --> 01:45:09.340]   Gosh, there were so, I can't go through all of them,
[01:45:09.340 --> 01:45:10.180]   I forget.
[01:45:10.180 --> 01:45:17.540]   Gang of Four, wait, Gang of Four is,
[01:45:19.420 --> 01:45:21.260]   shit, I forgot, what is it?
[01:45:21.260 --> 01:45:26.980]   Oh, I Find That Essence Rare, fires up.
[01:45:26.980 --> 01:45:29.780]   So I had like 10 that were just gonna,
[01:45:29.780 --> 01:45:32.180]   if any of those played, I'm gonna make it
[01:45:32.180 --> 01:45:35.740]   and I knew that it was about an hour and a half
[01:45:35.740 --> 01:45:38.020]   and that's as long as I'm gonna try it
[01:45:38.020 --> 01:45:39.620]   before I'm too tired.
[01:45:39.620 --> 01:45:41.040]   - So you're listening in the warehouse
[01:45:41.040 --> 01:45:41.880]   or you're listening in the warehouse?
[01:45:41.880 --> 01:45:43.960]   - In the warehouse, on random.
[01:45:43.960 --> 01:45:46.460]   And then the song that I made it to
[01:45:46.460 --> 01:45:50.780]   was off of that Prodigy album, Fat of the Lamb
[01:45:50.780 --> 01:45:53.180]   and it's called Climatize, it's an instrumental.
[01:45:53.180 --> 01:45:56.720]   I used it for a birdhouse edit when 411 was the thing.
[01:45:56.720 --> 01:46:01.420]   - 411 were these little like video newsletter type things.
[01:46:01.420 --> 01:46:02.340]   - Yeah. - Anyway.
[01:46:02.340 --> 01:46:07.080]   - So when that song came on, I was feeling it, I made it.
[01:46:07.080 --> 01:46:11.460]   - Fantastic, I love this because the neuroscientist in me
[01:46:11.460 --> 01:46:14.140]   is immediately gonna say, we have this brain
[01:46:14.140 --> 01:46:16.700]   that loves to take in information and discard
[01:46:16.700 --> 01:46:20.740]   other information, but paired association is so strong.
[01:46:20.740 --> 01:46:22.100]   - Yeah. - And when you couple that
[01:46:22.100 --> 01:46:25.220]   with some sense of reward, like the making of the varial
[01:46:25.220 --> 01:46:30.220]   below coping as early in life or making the 540s
[01:46:30.220 --> 01:46:34.620]   as a comeback to the injury, after the injury.
[01:46:34.620 --> 01:46:37.060]   - I mean, it was almost like I loved all that music,
[01:46:37.060 --> 01:46:40.380]   but I was indoctrinated by it through the skate parks
[01:46:40.380 --> 01:46:43.720]   because that was the soundtrack, it was punk music.
[01:46:44.160 --> 01:46:48.960]   It was Sex Pistols and 999 and Black Flag and Devo
[01:46:48.960 --> 01:46:53.960]   and X and Buzzcocks and that's what I kept hearing
[01:46:53.960 --> 01:46:57.800]   and that's what I associate with my best of times.
[01:46:57.800 --> 01:46:59.160]   - Yeah, it's in your nervous system.
[01:46:59.160 --> 01:47:02.520]   - Yeah. - Yeah, there's a few voices,
[01:47:02.520 --> 01:47:05.600]   Rancid and Tim Armstrong and the other guys.
[01:47:05.600 --> 01:47:07.440]   - Operation Ivy. - Operation Ivy.
[01:47:07.440 --> 01:47:10.120]   - Yeah, Sound System, Sound System was on that playlist,
[01:47:10.120 --> 01:47:11.240]   was on the 540 playlist.
[01:47:11.240 --> 01:47:13.700]   - All right, Tim will be so happy to hear that
[01:47:13.700 --> 01:47:16.240]   and Matt Freeman, the bass player and Jesse Michaels
[01:47:16.240 --> 01:47:17.560]   is now playing again with Tim.
[01:47:17.560 --> 01:47:18.400]   - Right. - The lead singer
[01:47:18.400 --> 01:47:21.200]   of Operation Ivy. - Yeah, with their new gig.
[01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:22.100]   What's it called?
[01:47:22.100 --> 01:47:25.640]   - They had a name and then they changed it.
[01:47:25.640 --> 01:47:28.480]   - Oh, okay. - Initially it was,
[01:47:28.480 --> 01:47:29.920]   well, I don't want to say 'cause they changed it
[01:47:29.920 --> 01:47:31.360]   for a reason. - That's all right.
[01:47:31.360 --> 01:47:32.540]   I know they're making new music.
[01:47:32.540 --> 01:47:34.880]   - Yeah, which is amazing, Operation Ivy is incredible.
[01:47:34.880 --> 01:47:37.480]   My yearbook photo for I think two years running
[01:47:37.480 --> 01:47:38.840]   was the cover of Operation Ivy
[01:47:38.840 --> 01:47:40.320]   'cause I didn't show up for the yearbook photo.
[01:47:40.320 --> 01:47:42.580]   Speaking of which, did you show up for yearbook photos
[01:47:42.580 --> 01:47:44.600]   or did you graduate high school?
[01:47:44.600 --> 01:47:45.840]   - I graduated high school
[01:47:45.840 --> 01:47:47.800]   but I didn't go to any of the events,
[01:47:47.800 --> 01:47:52.400]   prom or any of the auxiliary.
[01:47:52.400 --> 01:47:54.600]   I didn't know, I mean, I was an outcast.
[01:47:54.600 --> 01:47:58.320]   I was not, even though I had success in skating,
[01:47:58.320 --> 01:48:01.500]   skating wasn't cool and I was not homies
[01:48:01.500 --> 01:48:05.160]   with anyone at school except for two other skaters
[01:48:05.160 --> 01:48:10.000]   and we felt very ostracized, so nah.
[01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.700]   Yeah, I did show up for the graduation 'cause my mom
[01:48:12.700 --> 01:48:14.140]   and dad wanted to see it.
[01:48:14.140 --> 01:48:16.020]   - Yeah, likewise, I graduated but I could tell you more
[01:48:16.020 --> 01:48:17.860]   about the curbs in the parking lot of my high school
[01:48:17.860 --> 01:48:19.220]   than I could about anything that happened in the classroom.
[01:48:19.220 --> 01:48:21.740]   - Oh man, I broke so many sprinkler heads
[01:48:21.740 --> 01:48:23.940]   because the sprinkler heads were right next to the curb
[01:48:23.940 --> 01:48:25.680]   and there was a double-sided curb
[01:48:25.680 --> 01:48:27.500]   and so you board slide 'cause I'd go there early
[01:48:27.500 --> 01:48:29.620]   and board slide and then I'd just lean too far in
[01:48:29.620 --> 01:48:31.660]   and break the sprinkler head and never got caught.
[01:48:31.660 --> 01:48:33.220]   - What high school?
[01:48:33.220 --> 01:48:34.220]   - Well, I went to a couple.
[01:48:34.220 --> 01:48:38.300]   I went to Sarah High School originally,
[01:48:38.300 --> 01:48:41.180]   then I went to San Diguito High School,
[01:48:41.180 --> 01:48:43.640]   which is in North County and then I ended up at Torrey Pines.
[01:48:43.640 --> 01:48:45.200]   I got so bullied at San Diguito
[01:48:45.200 --> 01:48:47.240]   that I requested to be transferred
[01:48:47.240 --> 01:48:52.000]   because I couldn't survive there as a skater.
[01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.740]   I would have to hide my skateboard in the bushes
[01:48:54.740 --> 01:48:57.200]   before class and then go find it after school
[01:48:57.200 --> 01:48:58.900]   so that people wouldn't target me.
[01:48:58.900 --> 01:49:03.920]   - The '80s were rough, it was like a John Hughes film.
[01:49:03.920 --> 01:49:07.440]   - Well, for sure, it was jocks versus nerds
[01:49:07.440 --> 01:49:11.380]   and then skaters were like not even considered in that realm
[01:49:11.380 --> 01:49:14.440]   because they're just going to get hammered
[01:49:14.440 --> 01:49:15.940]   'cause there were so few of us.
[01:49:15.940 --> 01:49:17.760]   - Well, things have changed
[01:49:17.760 --> 01:49:19.380]   and not only have things have changed
[01:49:19.380 --> 01:49:22.020]   such that skateboarding is far more popular and respected
[01:49:22.020 --> 01:49:25.080]   and at least one mark of that is in the Olympics,
[01:49:25.080 --> 01:49:28.140]   although there are other marks of respect, certainly,
[01:49:28.140 --> 01:49:30.520]   but a huge evolution that I've observed
[01:49:30.520 --> 01:49:34.940]   is when I was skateboarding as a 14-year-old
[01:49:34.940 --> 01:49:39.940]   and close to my 20s and then took some time off for sure,
[01:49:39.940 --> 01:49:43.840]   hardly any girls, hardly any women,
[01:49:43.840 --> 01:49:46.420]   there were a few like Cara Beth Burnside,
[01:49:46.420 --> 01:49:50.240]   they got teased, ridiculed, it was hard on them.
[01:49:50.240 --> 01:49:51.420]   - Super hard, yeah. - Super hard.
[01:49:51.420 --> 01:49:55.100]   Now, largely through Instagram,
[01:49:55.100 --> 01:49:57.400]   but some other channels as well,
[01:49:57.400 --> 01:49:59.440]   you can see this young girl, Reese,
[01:49:59.440 --> 01:50:03.780]   on vert, skateboarding better than a lot of grown men
[01:50:03.780 --> 01:50:06.260]   who have been skateboarding for decades.
[01:50:06.260 --> 01:50:07.740]   And then there are a number of other ones
[01:50:07.740 --> 01:50:12.740]   in street skateboarding and also taking really hard slams.
[01:50:12.740 --> 01:50:17.700]   So this is a complete revision
[01:50:17.700 --> 01:50:20.100]   of the recent history of skateboarding.
[01:50:20.100 --> 01:50:23.620]   So thoughts on that and on Reese and there are a few others.
[01:50:23.620 --> 01:50:28.620]   Is it Lizzie who took a really bad fall that was filmed?
[01:50:28.620 --> 01:50:32.980]   - Broke the neck off her femur, yeah.
[01:50:32.980 --> 01:50:35.180]   - Yeah, these are tough ladies.
[01:50:35.180 --> 01:50:36.020]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:50:36.020 --> 01:50:37.540]   - For doing it and for coming back.
[01:50:37.540 --> 01:50:38.700]   - Lizzie did the loop.
[01:50:38.700 --> 01:50:42.520]   She did the full 360 loop, first woman to ever do it.
[01:50:42.520 --> 01:50:45.980]   - So what do you think changed, like that paved the way?
[01:50:45.980 --> 01:50:50.980]   Is it just a critical mass of females doing it?
[01:50:50.980 --> 01:50:54.620]   Is it that Sky Brown?
[01:50:54.620 --> 01:50:56.880]   - For sure, there were the pioneers,
[01:50:56.880 --> 01:51:01.880]   people like Cara Beth Burnside and there's so many others.
[01:51:02.680 --> 01:51:07.680]   Patty Hoffman was one of the first vert skaters too,
[01:51:07.680 --> 01:51:12.240]   who they planted the seed and then there were other women
[01:51:12.240 --> 01:51:15.640]   that took inspiration like, oh, girls can do this.
[01:51:15.640 --> 01:51:18.240]   Even though they're largely outnumbered
[01:51:18.240 --> 01:51:20.760]   and they get hassled for sure.
[01:51:20.760 --> 01:51:22.940]   And then through the street era,
[01:51:22.940 --> 01:51:25.820]   people like Alyssa Steemer who paved the way
[01:51:25.820 --> 01:51:28.100]   for legit street skating.
[01:51:29.280 --> 01:51:32.560]   But then through the years,
[01:51:32.560 --> 01:51:37.520]   it started to become more common, more accepted,
[01:51:37.520 --> 01:51:38.680]   which is dumb to say
[01:51:38.680 --> 01:51:41.500]   'cause it should have always been accepted.
[01:51:41.500 --> 01:51:44.400]   But the thing that really tipped the scale
[01:51:44.400 --> 01:51:47.700]   was when everything was leading up to the Olympics,
[01:51:47.700 --> 01:51:51.080]   there had to be equal divisions in equal disciplines
[01:51:51.080 --> 01:51:52.880]   for men and women.
[01:51:52.880 --> 01:51:54.160]   And suddenly there was no question
[01:51:54.160 --> 01:51:56.200]   of should we have a women's event?
[01:51:56.200 --> 01:51:58.200]   Like, no, we have to have a women's event
[01:51:58.200 --> 01:52:01.320]   because that's the road to qualifying
[01:52:01.320 --> 01:52:04.220]   for the Olympic stage.
[01:52:04.220 --> 01:52:07.400]   And Vance Park series to their credit,
[01:52:07.400 --> 01:52:10.120]   they were holding events simultaneously,
[01:52:10.120 --> 01:52:12.380]   not that we're Olympic qualifiers, but just their own.
[01:52:12.380 --> 01:52:15.960]   And they said, these events are equal across the board,
[01:52:15.960 --> 01:52:18.240]   equal prize money, equal attention.
[01:52:18.240 --> 01:52:20.960]   I mean, it was just like, that was just matter of fact.
[01:52:20.960 --> 01:52:23.740]   And that shifted a lot.
[01:52:23.740 --> 01:52:24.800]   It really did.
[01:52:24.800 --> 01:52:26.240]   Now if you go to a skate park,
[01:52:27.160 --> 01:52:28.920]   and you see plenty of women there.
[01:52:28.920 --> 01:52:29.920]   - Yeah, it's awesome.
[01:52:29.920 --> 01:52:32.400]   - Like literal women, like moms, you know?
[01:52:32.400 --> 01:52:37.280]   There are older women that are learning how to skate.
[01:52:37.280 --> 01:52:38.840]   It's awesome.
[01:52:38.840 --> 01:52:40.720]   - Not that it matters so much,
[01:52:40.720 --> 01:52:44.200]   but does anyone claim to be the first female
[01:52:44.200 --> 01:52:45.520]   to do 540 on vert?
[01:52:45.520 --> 01:52:46.360]   Is that sort of a known thing?
[01:52:46.360 --> 01:52:47.800]   - That would be Lindsay Adams.
[01:52:47.800 --> 01:52:50.760]   - Fantastic.
[01:52:50.760 --> 01:52:51.680]   - And she did that.
[01:52:51.680 --> 01:52:53.680]   I'll tell you how she did that.
[01:52:53.680 --> 01:52:54.940]   She was trying it.
[01:52:56.040 --> 01:52:58.560]   So she's trying to do McTwist.
[01:52:58.560 --> 01:53:00.380]   She's married to Travis Pastrana.
[01:53:00.380 --> 01:53:02.120]   It's like the, you know?
[01:53:02.120 --> 01:53:06.840]   It's like the elite action sports couple.
[01:53:06.840 --> 01:53:09.480]   And she was trying them.
[01:53:09.480 --> 01:53:11.680]   She was getting pretty close.
[01:53:11.680 --> 01:53:15.840]   And then we did a big exhibition in Paris
[01:53:15.840 --> 01:53:19.080]   at the Grand Palais on behalf of Quicksilver.
[01:53:19.080 --> 01:53:21.520]   It was a huge event.
[01:53:21.520 --> 01:53:24.940]   They put a half pipe up and we did this giant show.
[01:53:25.840 --> 01:53:27.760]   There were thousands of people there.
[01:53:27.760 --> 01:53:32.520]   And it was very much unspoken but expected
[01:53:32.520 --> 01:53:36.520]   that I was gonna do a 900 at this event.
[01:53:36.520 --> 01:53:39.600]   I think it was, I wanna say it was 2010 maybe.
[01:53:39.600 --> 01:53:44.280]   And, or no, like 2009.
[01:53:44.280 --> 01:53:47.640]   And the organizers were kind of like,
[01:53:47.640 --> 01:53:48.480]   "Okay, so we're gonna do this.
[01:53:48.480 --> 01:53:52.080]   "And then, you know, at some point you do a 900."
[01:53:52.080 --> 01:53:55.160]   And I was like, "I can't guarantee that ever."
[01:53:55.160 --> 01:53:56.520]   Like every time I've ever made it,
[01:53:56.520 --> 01:53:57.840]   it's been pretty spontaneous.
[01:53:57.840 --> 01:53:59.840]   I, you know, I've set out to do it and not,
[01:53:59.840 --> 01:54:01.000]   I've come up short.
[01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:01.840]   I can't guarantee it.
[01:54:01.840 --> 01:54:03.420]   I'll try, I'll try.
[01:54:03.420 --> 01:54:06.240]   And they were like, "Yeah, yeah, okay."
[01:54:06.240 --> 01:54:08.540]   And so I knew the whole time that we're skating,
[01:54:08.540 --> 01:54:09.920]   I was like, "Okay, everyone's expecting this."
[01:54:09.920 --> 01:54:12.040]   So I kind of went through the motions
[01:54:12.040 --> 01:54:17.040]   of doing my exhibition tricks, you know, playing the hits
[01:54:17.040 --> 01:54:19.840]   and then started trying 900s.
[01:54:19.840 --> 01:54:23.160]   And at the same time, Lindsay started trying 540s
[01:54:23.160 --> 01:54:25.320]   'cause she was feeling that energy.
[01:54:25.320 --> 01:54:28.880]   And so it was this sort of, not battle,
[01:54:28.880 --> 01:54:31.360]   but definitely we were trading hits.
[01:54:31.360 --> 01:54:33.080]   It was like, "All right, here goes Johnny, it's a nine,
[01:54:33.080 --> 01:54:33.920]   "oh, you missed it.
[01:54:33.920 --> 01:54:36.740]   "And here goes Lindsay, oh, she missed it."
[01:54:36.740 --> 01:54:41.740]   And then I, she almost made one, like was riding down,
[01:54:41.740 --> 01:54:48.680]   you know, and then fell at the flat bottom.
[01:54:48.680 --> 01:54:51.920]   It was like, "Oh, and then I made 900."
[01:54:51.920 --> 01:54:54.760]   And that was kind of the showstopper.
[01:54:54.760 --> 01:54:55.960]   'Cause like that's what they expected
[01:54:55.960 --> 01:54:58.280]   and everyone's going crazy and whatever.
[01:54:58.280 --> 01:55:00.620]   People are coming down off the ramp, knees sliding down
[01:55:00.620 --> 01:55:03.040]   and we're saying goodbye to the crowd.
[01:55:03.040 --> 01:55:06.000]   And I look up and Lindsay puts her tail out.
[01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.480]   There's still people standing on the ramp
[01:55:08.480 --> 01:55:09.320]   and she puts her tail out.
[01:55:09.320 --> 01:55:11.580]   And I was like, "I think Lindsay wants to try it again.
[01:55:11.580 --> 01:55:13.600]   "Here we go, I'm on the mic now."
[01:55:13.600 --> 01:55:15.580]   She made it, love it.
[01:55:15.580 --> 01:55:18.160]   She stole the show.
[01:55:18.160 --> 01:55:21.360]   Like without question, it was huge.
[01:55:21.360 --> 01:55:24.440]   You can look it up on YouTube, like it's there.
[01:55:24.440 --> 01:55:27.240]   Lindsay Adams, first 540.
[01:55:27.240 --> 01:55:28.280]   It was awesome.
[01:55:28.280 --> 01:55:30.760]   And then she made it and we all grabbed her
[01:55:30.760 --> 01:55:32.740]   and put her on her shoulders.
[01:55:32.740 --> 01:55:33.580]   - That is awesome.
[01:55:33.580 --> 01:55:34.560]   - It was really cool.
[01:55:34.560 --> 01:55:35.400]   - That is awesome.
[01:55:35.400 --> 01:55:38.060]   'Cause these things are like the four minute mile
[01:55:38.060 --> 01:55:39.960]   as a barrier, then people break that barrier
[01:55:39.960 --> 01:55:41.480]   and then other people break that barrier.
[01:55:41.480 --> 01:55:44.480]   It's, I mean, I've watched enough of skateboarding
[01:55:44.480 --> 01:55:45.320]   in recent years.
[01:55:45.320 --> 01:55:48.100]   You know, like the Sky Brown thing, she's phenomenal.
[01:55:48.100 --> 01:55:51.180]   And I actually saw her family out to dinner here
[01:55:51.180 --> 01:55:53.860]   in Los Angeles and with her brother
[01:55:53.860 --> 01:55:56.200]   and her folks are really gracious, really nice.
[01:55:56.200 --> 01:55:59.260]   And there again, you know, parents going to the skate park.
[01:55:59.260 --> 01:56:01.000]   After all, she's couldn't drive herself.
[01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.100]   I think she's at that time she was probably like nine.
[01:56:03.100 --> 01:56:05.640]   - That's probably one of the biggest shifts too,
[01:56:05.640 --> 01:56:09.580]   is that parents encourage their kids to skate now.
[01:56:09.580 --> 01:56:12.540]   Could you imagine that when we were young?
[01:56:12.540 --> 01:56:13.360]   Never.
[01:56:13.360 --> 01:56:14.940]   - No, there were so many factors telling us not to,
[01:56:14.940 --> 01:56:16.860]   which just made us want to do it more.
[01:56:16.860 --> 01:56:19.140]   - Sure, yeah, now kids are like,
[01:56:19.140 --> 01:56:21.260]   parents are pushing them into it.
[01:56:21.260 --> 01:56:23.300]   Get out there, learn tricks.
[01:56:23.300 --> 01:56:25.340]   It's like, wait, that's not what we're supposed to be doing.
[01:56:25.340 --> 01:56:30.020]   But it's cool that, I think with the really cool factor
[01:56:30.020 --> 01:56:33.800]   of all that is there are definitely people our age,
[01:56:33.800 --> 01:56:37.420]   I'm grouping you into my age category.
[01:56:37.420 --> 01:56:38.260]   - I'm 47.
[01:56:38.260 --> 01:56:40.140]   - All right, close enough.
[01:56:40.140 --> 01:56:42.860]   But that have kids and skateboarding
[01:56:42.860 --> 01:56:44.880]   was such a special time in our life.
[01:56:44.880 --> 01:56:46.920]   And then they're rediscovering it through their kids
[01:56:46.920 --> 01:56:48.420]   and they're skating together.
[01:56:48.420 --> 01:56:51.840]   And I think that's just so amazing
[01:56:51.840 --> 01:56:56.220]   that someone of our age would be like,
[01:56:56.220 --> 01:56:57.680]   you know what, I used to do that.
[01:56:57.680 --> 01:56:59.840]   You're into that, like, let's go.
[01:56:59.840 --> 01:57:02.480]   And then you could show your kid how to do a sweeper.
[01:57:02.480 --> 01:57:04.600]   - I can probably do that.
[01:57:04.600 --> 01:57:06.220]   I don't have kids yet, but when I do,
[01:57:06.220 --> 01:57:09.520]   I intend on being healthy enough to do a sweeper.
[01:57:09.520 --> 01:57:10.580]   People can look up sweeper.
[01:57:10.580 --> 01:57:11.760]   We don't have to explain it for them,
[01:57:11.760 --> 01:57:13.960]   but a little layback grind or a sweeper.
[01:57:13.960 --> 01:57:16.640]   - Yep, oh yeah, because they wouldn't think to do it.
[01:57:16.640 --> 01:57:19.180]   - No, and they are doing all these difficult flip tricks
[01:57:19.180 --> 01:57:21.100]   and that's not my scene.
[01:57:21.100 --> 01:57:22.800]   - Yeah, what's your go-to on a game of skate
[01:57:22.800 --> 01:57:25.700]   if you're going to really take out the younger generation?
[01:57:25.700 --> 01:57:28.700]   - I can do impossibles pretty regularly.
[01:57:28.700 --> 01:57:32.240]   - On transition.
[01:57:32.240 --> 01:57:33.840]   - Consistently, I can do them on flat.
[01:57:33.840 --> 01:57:36.200]   - So this is where basically you scrape the back of the,
[01:57:36.200 --> 01:57:38.760]   it's an ollie really, but it wraps around the back foot.
[01:57:38.760 --> 01:57:41.100]   - The whole board wraps over your foot.
[01:57:41.100 --> 01:57:44.380]   That's kind of my sneak attack on games of skate.
[01:57:44.380 --> 01:57:46.580]   - Does Rodney Mullen get credit for that trick still?
[01:57:46.580 --> 01:57:47.420]   - Oh yes.
[01:57:47.420 --> 01:57:48.420]   - That's a Rodney.
[01:57:48.420 --> 01:57:50.380]   Are you still in touch with Rodney?
[01:57:50.380 --> 01:57:51.400]   - Absolutely, yeah.
[01:57:51.400 --> 01:57:54.740]   - Yeah, he's somebody that certainly deserves mention
[01:57:54.740 --> 01:57:56.700]   in the pioneering of tricks, I think of-
[01:57:56.700 --> 01:57:58.620]   - He's the godfather of modern skateboarding.
[01:57:58.620 --> 01:58:03.180]   - I think of Rodney, you, and Mark Gonzalez Gons
[01:58:03.180 --> 01:58:05.380]   as like the guys that-
[01:58:05.380 --> 01:58:06.220]   - I'm honored.
[01:58:06.220 --> 01:58:10.160]   - Drove the progression in different,
[01:58:10.160 --> 01:58:13.340]   partially overlapping directions that set the template
[01:58:13.340 --> 01:58:14.180]   for essentially-
[01:58:14.180 --> 01:58:15.780]   - I learned fingertips because of Rodney.
[01:58:15.780 --> 01:58:17.300]   Like the first trick you saw me do,
[01:58:17.300 --> 01:58:19.580]   I learned that because I saw Rodney do it on the ground
[01:58:19.580 --> 01:58:21.980]   and I thought, well, I can't do it on the ground,
[01:58:21.980 --> 01:58:24.720]   but I have plenty of time in the air to do it.
[01:58:24.720 --> 01:58:25.560]   - It's awesome.
[01:58:25.560 --> 01:58:27.460]   It's awesome that Stacey put you guys together.
[01:58:27.460 --> 01:58:28.820]   We mentioned Bones Brigade,
[01:58:28.820 --> 01:58:32.060]   but we didn't really talk about the architecture of it
[01:58:32.060 --> 01:58:33.900]   from the perspective of skateboard progression,
[01:58:33.900 --> 01:58:37.100]   but it was kind of like any good band.
[01:58:37.100 --> 01:58:39.780]   It seemed like there was really good chemistry
[01:58:39.780 --> 01:58:43.060]   interpersonally, but also that there was,
[01:58:43.060 --> 01:58:44.320]   each person had something unique.
[01:58:44.320 --> 01:58:46.560]   You skated the way you did, Mike skated the way he did,
[01:58:46.560 --> 01:58:50.120]   Stevie the way he did, and Rodney and-
[01:58:50.120 --> 01:58:53.180]   - We respected each other, but we also fed off each other.
[01:58:53.180 --> 01:58:55.120]   - Tommy Guerrero, right?
[01:58:55.120 --> 01:58:56.960]   'Cause growing up in the Bay Area.
[01:58:56.960 --> 01:59:00.200]   In fact, Tommy's skating the hills of San Francisco
[01:59:00.200 --> 01:59:02.320]   in those videos, makes it look easy,
[01:59:02.320 --> 01:59:05.280]   but those hills are rough, they're dangerous,
[01:59:05.280 --> 01:59:07.980]   and they have real life obstacles like moving buses.
[01:59:07.980 --> 01:59:10.220]   You'll notice he wasn't stopping his top signs,
[01:59:10.220 --> 01:59:12.040]   so that's fantastic.
[01:59:12.040 --> 01:59:13.920]   We could reminisce about all these angles,
[01:59:13.920 --> 01:59:17.980]   but the point being that spending time with people
[01:59:17.980 --> 01:59:20.020]   who do similar things or the same thing,
[01:59:20.020 --> 01:59:23.240]   but do it differently is one of the best ways to progress.
[01:59:23.240 --> 01:59:25.540]   This is why I routinely fly to Texas
[01:59:25.540 --> 01:59:27.500]   and hang out with Peter Attia, another podcaster,
[01:59:27.500 --> 01:59:29.060]   Lex Friedman, just 'cause they do things
[01:59:29.060 --> 01:59:30.880]   differently than I do.
[01:59:30.880 --> 01:59:35.620]   Where do you draw sort of peripheral inspiration from now?
[01:59:35.620 --> 01:59:38.640]   I know you see Jimmy Wilkins at your ramp quite a lot,
[01:59:38.640 --> 01:59:40.720]   the phenom, Jimmy Wilkins.
[01:59:40.720 --> 01:59:42.760]   It's kind of eerie how good that kid is.
[01:59:42.760 --> 01:59:46.280]   Who else are you spending time with besides Reece?
[01:59:46.280 --> 01:59:48.160]   And one of the reasons I asked this is that skateboarding
[01:59:48.160 --> 01:59:52.000]   is unique among many sports in that a given session,
[01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:56.120]   a gathering to skateboard will include an enormous range.
[01:59:56.120 --> 01:59:57.880]   - 55-year-old men and 10-year-old girls.
[01:59:57.880 --> 02:00:00.440]   - Exactly, which is incredible.
[02:00:00.440 --> 02:00:03.260]   You don't think about soccer, a serious game of soccer
[02:00:03.260 --> 02:00:04.820]   between professional soccer players.
[02:00:04.820 --> 02:00:07.180]   - But also, it's not even that we're skating together,
[02:00:07.180 --> 02:00:12.100]   it's that we are communicating and influencing each other.
[02:00:12.100 --> 02:00:16.920]   I mean, that is like the last conversation I had with Reece
[02:00:16.920 --> 02:00:18.280]   was she's talking about like,
[02:00:18.280 --> 02:00:19.740]   "Are you gonna try to do 540 again?"
[02:00:19.740 --> 02:00:21.420]   I go, "Yeah, I'm kind of working on it."
[02:00:21.420 --> 02:00:23.240]   She goes, "Well, I think," 'cause she saw me try one.
[02:00:23.240 --> 02:00:25.040]   She goes, "I think you need to pull out a little more."
[02:00:25.040 --> 02:00:26.540]   And she was right.
[02:00:26.540 --> 02:00:27.460]   - And she's how old again?
[02:00:27.460 --> 02:00:28.300]   - She's 10.
[02:00:28.300 --> 02:00:30.820]   And I didn't even consider that
[02:00:30.820 --> 02:00:32.820]   because I'm just back in my mode
[02:00:32.820 --> 02:00:34.800]   and I'm not taking into consideration
[02:00:34.800 --> 02:00:37.820]   that I don't have the snap that I had before I got hurt.
[02:00:37.820 --> 02:00:40.520]   And she was, I mean, that was one key to me making it.
[02:00:40.520 --> 02:00:44.200]   And, you know, but to me,
[02:00:44.200 --> 02:00:47.800]   that's just, that's representative of skateboarding
[02:00:47.800 --> 02:00:50.480]   and the inclusivity of it and the diversity of it,
[02:00:50.480 --> 02:00:54.480]   where it's me, I'm 55, there's 30-year-old pros
[02:00:54.480 --> 02:00:58.540]   that are at the top of the game.
[02:00:58.540 --> 02:01:03.540]   There are 17-year-old up-and-comers, men, women,
[02:01:04.540 --> 02:01:06.920]   10-year-old girl that is doing tricks
[02:01:06.920 --> 02:01:10.880]   that we've never even thought of or want to do.
[02:01:10.880 --> 02:01:15.880]   And it's all part of the whole mix.
[02:01:15.880 --> 02:01:17.920]   - That's really beautiful.
[02:01:17.920 --> 02:01:21.980]   I want to ask you about memorabilia.
[02:01:21.980 --> 02:01:25.180]   Not a topic that I think about much,
[02:01:25.180 --> 02:01:27.040]   but I think in a prior conversation of ours,
[02:01:27.040 --> 02:01:28.720]   you mentioned something about this.
[02:01:28.720 --> 02:01:32.080]   So, you know, there are skateboard collectors.
[02:01:32.080 --> 02:01:34.640]   There are people that collect stickers, skateboards.
[02:01:34.640 --> 02:01:37.660]   There's a whole market and world for this.
[02:01:37.660 --> 02:01:41.120]   And in addition to people wanting selfies with you
[02:01:41.120 --> 02:01:44.040]   when they see you, I imagine there's a long history
[02:01:44.040 --> 02:01:46.280]   and continued tradition of people taking a pen,
[02:01:46.280 --> 02:01:49.520]   putting your hand and saying, can you sign this, right?
[02:01:49.520 --> 02:01:53.240]   Because you are in this very small,
[02:01:53.240 --> 02:01:56.540]   but very clearly esteemed group of people
[02:01:56.540 --> 02:01:59.760]   where your signature increases the value of things.
[02:01:59.760 --> 02:02:03.560]   So how does that work and how does that feel?
[02:02:03.560 --> 02:02:06.580]   Like if a skateboarder who, you know,
[02:02:06.580 --> 02:02:09.520]   there are the telltale signs of who is and who isn't, right?
[02:02:09.520 --> 02:02:12.200]   If they walk up to you and they're like,
[02:02:12.200 --> 02:02:13.860]   hey, will you sign this?
[02:02:13.860 --> 02:02:15.000]   Do you feel good about signing it
[02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:16.720]   or is that something that you refrain from?
[02:02:16.720 --> 02:02:19.520]   And if somebody is just merely a collector, a trader,
[02:02:19.520 --> 02:02:23.500]   and they're trying to build their portfolio, so to speak,
[02:02:23.500 --> 02:02:24.960]   you can probably also sense that.
[02:02:24.960 --> 02:02:28.080]   So I'm not trying to put you in the hot seat here.
[02:02:28.080 --> 02:02:30.680]   - Well, to answer your question, through the years,
[02:02:30.680 --> 02:02:35.120]   I was always open to that and I'm happy to,
[02:02:35.120 --> 02:02:38.800]   especially when people are skaters or skate fans
[02:02:38.800 --> 02:02:39.820]   and whatnot.
[02:02:39.820 --> 02:02:44.820]   In the last three years, there has been this new element
[02:02:44.820 --> 02:02:50.420]   of resellers, of people that just go buy signature stuff.
[02:02:50.420 --> 02:02:51.960]   They have nothing to do with skating.
[02:02:51.960 --> 02:02:53.760]   They don't care about skateboarding at all.
[02:02:53.760 --> 02:02:58.640]   They just want to get my signature on an item and sell it.
[02:02:58.640 --> 02:03:01.640]   And they usually do it on eBay or through their own channels.
[02:03:01.640 --> 02:03:04.260]   That's fine at some point.
[02:03:04.260 --> 02:03:06.360]   Like a few years ago, I respected the hustle.
[02:03:06.360 --> 02:03:08.480]   These guys, they knew that I was gonna be at this event.
[02:03:08.480 --> 02:03:09.580]   Okay, they're outside waiting.
[02:03:09.580 --> 02:03:10.700]   They've been waiting for hours.
[02:03:10.700 --> 02:03:12.380]   I'll sign a couple of things.
[02:03:12.380 --> 02:03:15.320]   But in recent months even,
[02:03:15.320 --> 02:03:19.240]   they have figured out how to get my flight info.
[02:03:19.240 --> 02:03:23.000]   Like some hacked into my actual airline accounts.
[02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:27.160]   Some have sources at certain airports that get the manifest
[02:03:27.160 --> 02:03:28.580]   and they sell the information.
[02:03:28.580 --> 02:03:29.420]   I found all this out
[02:03:29.420 --> 02:03:32.680]   because I've actually held a couple of them accountable
[02:03:32.680 --> 02:03:34.200]   because I said, look, I'm not gonna sign this
[02:03:34.200 --> 02:03:36.120]   until you tell me how you knew I was gonna be here.
[02:03:36.120 --> 02:03:37.840]   I have no business here.
[02:03:37.840 --> 02:03:39.040]   I'm here to visit family.
[02:03:39.040 --> 02:03:40.680]   No one knows I'm coming here.
[02:03:40.680 --> 02:03:44.440]   Oh, well, a friend said they saw you at the Detroit airport.
[02:03:44.440 --> 02:03:45.560]   Like, no, they didn't.
[02:03:45.560 --> 02:03:48.640]   They wouldn't know where I'm going to anyway.
[02:03:48.640 --> 02:03:49.640]   Like, oh, I saw it on Twitter.
[02:03:49.640 --> 02:03:50.920]   You didn't see it on Twitter.
[02:03:50.920 --> 02:03:52.600]   I'm on Twitter.
[02:03:52.600 --> 02:03:54.480]   Tell me the truth.
[02:03:54.480 --> 02:03:56.480]   There was a guy from TMZ that gets flight info
[02:03:56.480 --> 02:03:57.600]   and he sells it to us.
[02:03:57.600 --> 02:04:00.080]   Okay, thank you.
[02:04:00.080 --> 02:04:02.320]   But that has increased to a point
[02:04:02.320 --> 02:04:04.040]   where it's not sustainable.
[02:04:04.040 --> 02:04:06.360]   I can't please everyone.
[02:04:06.360 --> 02:04:08.560]   The last time I flew out of Chicago,
[02:04:08.560 --> 02:04:11.480]   there were about 15 people.
[02:04:11.480 --> 02:04:15.480]   One guy had a shopping cart full of skateboards
[02:04:15.480 --> 02:04:19.020]   and they all bum-rushed me at security
[02:04:19.020 --> 02:04:20.480]   before I went through security
[02:04:20.480 --> 02:04:21.760]   thinking that I'm gonna sign stuff.
[02:04:21.760 --> 02:04:24.320]   I'm like, you guys, I can't do that.
[02:04:24.320 --> 02:04:28.040]   I'm gonna miss my flight and I can't delineate.
[02:04:28.040 --> 02:04:29.800]   Like, I'm sorry.
[02:04:29.800 --> 02:04:31.580]   You guys have like sabotaged yourselves.
[02:04:31.580 --> 02:04:32.960]   I don't know what to say.
[02:04:32.960 --> 02:04:35.000]   And then I went through security
[02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.040]   and there were four dudes waiting at the gate.
[02:04:37.040 --> 02:04:39.520]   They had bought tickets, airline tickets,
[02:04:39.520 --> 02:04:41.400]   so that it could be past security.
[02:04:41.400 --> 02:04:46.580]   Airline tickets they're not gonna use to chase this.
[02:04:46.580 --> 02:04:47.420]   - Wow.
[02:04:47.420 --> 02:04:50.560]   - So, I mean, wham, people want my autograph,
[02:04:50.560 --> 02:04:54.200]   but it's weird and it's intrusive and it's kind of creepy.
[02:04:54.200 --> 02:04:56.760]   - Yeah, just tell them that a neuroscientist told you
[02:04:56.760 --> 02:04:59.320]   that you gotta get that slobber right.
[02:04:59.320 --> 02:05:01.880]   And if you sign too many autographs,
[02:05:01.880 --> 02:05:02.720]   that you're never gonna get that.
[02:05:02.720 --> 02:05:04.160]   - You're gonna regret all my chances of getting it back.
[02:05:04.160 --> 02:05:05.640]   - You're not gonna get the tuck knee.
[02:05:05.640 --> 02:05:08.080]   You're not just not gonna be do the flap knee invert.
[02:05:08.080 --> 02:05:08.920]   You're just not gonna get it.
[02:05:08.920 --> 02:05:13.920]   - Anyway, it's just a really weird thing that has popped up.
[02:05:13.920 --> 02:05:15.620]   And other than that,
[02:05:15.620 --> 02:05:18.980]   and so the tricky part is when there is a public thing
[02:05:18.980 --> 02:05:20.660]   or a public exhibition or whatever,
[02:05:20.660 --> 02:05:24.260]   to try to figure out who is the true skate fans
[02:05:24.260 --> 02:05:25.100]   and who aren't.
[02:05:25.100 --> 02:05:27.700]   Usually they're pretty identifiable,
[02:05:27.700 --> 02:05:31.220]   but it just, it has ruined the experience
[02:05:31.220 --> 02:05:33.620]   for people who truly are, that grew up skating.
[02:05:33.620 --> 02:05:36.360]   - Well, thanks for sharing that.
[02:05:36.360 --> 02:05:40.040]   And we won't tell everyone what the telltale signs are
[02:05:40.040 --> 02:05:41.620]   so that these people don't exploit them.
[02:05:41.620 --> 02:05:44.460]   The skateboarders, the real fans will know.
[02:05:44.460 --> 02:05:46.580]   They won't even have to worry about
[02:05:46.580 --> 02:05:48.260]   whether or not they represent accurately
[02:05:48.260 --> 02:05:49.420]   'cause you just will.
[02:05:49.420 --> 02:05:51.820]   On the positive side,
[02:05:51.820 --> 02:05:54.800]   something I've been wanting to learn more about from you
[02:05:54.800 --> 02:05:58.600]   is your philanthropic efforts.
[02:05:58.600 --> 02:06:03.480]   I think Kevin Rose, who's in the tech sector,
[02:06:03.480 --> 02:06:07.000]   was the first to mention to me that you have,
[02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:09.800]   you guys have done some philanthropy together
[02:06:09.800 --> 02:06:11.840]   and maybe you've done some with Jim Thiebaud as well,
[02:06:11.840 --> 02:06:13.080]   the great Jim Thiebaud.
[02:06:13.080 --> 02:06:16.640]   - Yeah, well, both Jim and Kevin were board members.
[02:06:17.760 --> 02:06:20.720]   Jim is the current board member of the Skatepark Project.
[02:06:20.720 --> 02:06:22.480]   - Well, tell us about the Skatepark Project.
[02:06:22.480 --> 02:06:27.100]   - It's my nonprofit and we try to develop
[02:06:27.100 --> 02:06:29.580]   public skate parks in underserved areas,
[02:06:29.580 --> 02:06:32.620]   but more so by supporting the community
[02:06:32.620 --> 02:06:34.340]   and giving them the resources to do so.
[02:06:34.340 --> 02:06:36.620]   So groups that are trying to get skate parks in the area,
[02:06:36.620 --> 02:06:39.660]   we are the resource center for them.
[02:06:39.660 --> 02:06:41.940]   We'll give them advice, we'll give them funding,
[02:06:41.940 --> 02:06:44.880]   we'll give them our stamp of approval
[02:06:44.880 --> 02:06:46.360]   and that can go a long way.
[02:06:46.360 --> 02:06:50.280]   And to date, we've helped to fund over
[02:06:50.280 --> 02:06:51.900]   almost a thousand skate parks now
[02:06:51.900 --> 02:06:54.900]   and seven or 800 of which are open.
[02:06:54.900 --> 02:06:57.520]   I mean, it's my proudest work for sure
[02:06:57.520 --> 02:07:02.520]   and it's because I never took for granted
[02:07:02.520 --> 02:07:05.660]   the fact that I grew up near a skate park
[02:07:05.660 --> 02:07:07.040]   and that was my home away from home.
[02:07:07.040 --> 02:07:08.800]   That was where I found my sense of community,
[02:07:08.800 --> 02:07:12.920]   my sense of identity, my crew.
[02:07:12.920 --> 02:07:15.760]   And so many kids choose to skateboard
[02:07:15.760 --> 02:07:18.120]   but have no support in doing so.
[02:07:18.120 --> 02:07:20.520]   And so those skate parks are a lifeline.
[02:07:20.520 --> 02:07:23.720]   - Yeah, I can attest, they absolutely save lives.
[02:07:23.720 --> 02:07:25.200]   There's no question.
[02:07:25.200 --> 02:07:28.240]   Where can people find out more about your foundation?
[02:07:28.240 --> 02:07:29.440]   We can provide a link, but I guess-
[02:07:29.440 --> 02:07:30.760]   - Skatepark.org.
[02:07:30.760 --> 02:07:32.520]   - So where does the funding for these parks
[02:07:32.520 --> 02:07:33.960]   actually come from?
[02:07:33.960 --> 02:07:36.380]   - It comes from donations from supporters,
[02:07:36.380 --> 02:07:39.840]   it comes from fundraisers, some corporate.
[02:07:39.840 --> 02:07:43.200]   Sometimes funding is funneled through us
[02:07:43.200 --> 02:07:48.200]   for specific regions like we have a built to play project
[02:07:48.200 --> 02:07:50.480]   that's in Michigan and New York
[02:07:50.480 --> 02:07:54.180]   and that's funded by the Ralph C. Wilson Jr. Foundation.
[02:07:54.180 --> 02:07:56.340]   So they give us the funding
[02:07:56.340 --> 02:07:59.320]   and then we have to give it to that area.
[02:07:59.320 --> 02:08:02.220]   But it's easy because there's plenty of projects
[02:08:02.220 --> 02:08:05.520]   and now there's an abundance of skate parks in those areas.
[02:08:05.520 --> 02:08:06.440]   - I love it.
[02:08:06.440 --> 02:08:09.440]   Thank you for doing that, for organizing around that.
[02:08:09.440 --> 02:08:11.440]   - And I get to get more places to skate.
[02:08:11.920 --> 02:08:14.080]   [laughing]
[02:08:14.080 --> 02:08:18.000]   - I'm curious what's in the immediate horizon, right?
[02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.000]   These days you probably have the option
[02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.880]   to say yes to things and no to things.
[02:08:22.880 --> 02:08:26.840]   You have a family, you have your skateboard career.
[02:08:26.840 --> 02:08:30.500]   Where do you place your priorities
[02:08:30.500 --> 02:08:32.500]   in terms of how to carve up your day or your week?
[02:08:32.500 --> 02:08:35.920]   I mean, what would you like to make sure that you do
[02:08:35.920 --> 02:08:39.600]   for as much of the hours of your waking day for the next,
[02:08:39.600 --> 02:08:42.480]   let's just say five years 'cause if you want to extend
[02:08:42.480 --> 02:08:44.400]   that out, you can, but.
[02:08:44.400 --> 02:08:48.520]   - Well, I want to be available to my kids first and foremost
[02:08:48.520 --> 02:08:52.200]   and we still have one at home for the next four years.
[02:08:52.200 --> 02:08:56.840]   So I will make sure that I'm available to her.
[02:08:56.840 --> 02:09:01.840]   And in terms of career, I never had great aspirations.
[02:09:01.840 --> 02:09:04.480]   Like I never thought, okay,
[02:09:04.480 --> 02:09:05.680]   this is what I want to accomplish.
[02:09:05.680 --> 02:09:10.600]   It was always just very more trick specific oriented.
[02:09:10.600 --> 02:09:12.680]   So it was always like, I want to try this and this and this.
[02:09:12.680 --> 02:09:14.240]   I would like to continue skating.
[02:09:14.240 --> 02:09:15.760]   I don't know if I'll be able to skate
[02:09:15.760 --> 02:09:18.420]   at the level I'm skating right now in five years,
[02:09:18.420 --> 02:09:20.760]   but I know that I'll still be on the ramp.
[02:09:20.760 --> 02:09:22.360]   I may not be doing it in public.
[02:09:22.360 --> 02:09:26.780]   Trying to advocate for public skate parks,
[02:09:26.780 --> 02:09:28.600]   doing more with the foundation.
[02:09:28.600 --> 02:09:32.960]   And whatever, I think the way I prioritize my time
[02:09:32.960 --> 02:09:37.000]   is what will resonate the furthest and have the best impact
[02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:38.280]   on skateboarding in general.
[02:09:38.280 --> 02:09:41.960]   I do feel that I've come to a point where yes,
[02:09:41.960 --> 02:09:46.440]   I'm some unofficial ambassador to skateboarding
[02:09:46.440 --> 02:09:48.400]   and I want to represent it well.
[02:09:48.400 --> 02:09:53.160]   I want to be fair in that skateboarding
[02:09:53.160 --> 02:09:54.840]   is all kinds of different things.
[02:09:54.840 --> 02:09:58.320]   It's not just X Games or Olympics or whatnot.
[02:09:58.320 --> 02:10:03.160]   It represents a true culture.
[02:10:03.160 --> 02:10:07.800]   And I want to project that as much as I can
[02:10:07.800 --> 02:10:09.520]   and make sure that people understand
[02:10:09.520 --> 02:10:10.860]   that that's also positive.
[02:10:10.860 --> 02:10:17.040]   And I mean, really everything that I'm doing now
[02:10:17.040 --> 02:10:18.640]   is just kind of fun.
[02:10:18.640 --> 02:10:23.800]   I would say in the last five to 10 years
[02:10:23.800 --> 02:10:26.480]   is the first time I've truly enjoyed
[02:10:26.480 --> 02:10:30.040]   what skateboarding has provided me in terms of opportunity
[02:10:30.040 --> 02:10:34.720]   and what it brings to me and what it means to my family.
[02:10:34.720 --> 02:10:37.160]   Like I have a much better appreciation
[02:10:37.160 --> 02:10:38.520]   and understanding for it.
[02:10:38.520 --> 02:10:40.640]   And these days, it's just like,
[02:10:40.640 --> 02:10:41.860]   everything's kind of just gravy.
[02:10:41.860 --> 02:10:43.180]   It's just so fun.
[02:10:43.180 --> 02:10:44.720]   I can't believe I can still do it for a living.
[02:10:44.720 --> 02:10:45.560]   It's crazy.
[02:10:45.560 --> 02:10:50.560]   I'm 55 years old and I truly ride my skateboard as a career.
[02:10:50.560 --> 02:10:52.280]   Like that's nuts.
[02:10:52.280 --> 02:10:54.080]   And I wouldn't have it any other way.
[02:10:55.120 --> 02:10:57.000]   Well, it certainly is earned.
[02:10:57.000 --> 02:11:00.560]   And I just want to say thank you for a number of things.
[02:11:00.560 --> 02:11:05.600]   First of all, thank you for going to the skate park.
[02:11:05.600 --> 02:11:08.420]   Thank you for picking this trajectory.
[02:11:08.420 --> 02:11:12.000]   Thank you for inspiring me and so many other young people
[02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:16.020]   and old people, older people over so many decades now,
[02:11:16.020 --> 02:11:18.300]   both with what you did on a skateboard
[02:11:18.300 --> 02:11:21.580]   and off the skateboard and including your resilience
[02:11:21.580 --> 02:11:25.260]   and determination to push and continue to progress
[02:11:25.260 --> 02:11:27.560]   to the point where you were badly injured.
[02:11:27.560 --> 02:11:29.980]   And then to push through that, come back,
[02:11:29.980 --> 02:11:31.660]   at least match what you did previously.
[02:11:31.660 --> 02:11:34.420]   And I would wager that you will exceed
[02:11:34.420 --> 02:11:37.340]   your prior skill level going forward.
[02:11:37.340 --> 02:11:39.340]   So I want to thank you for your resilience.
[02:11:39.340 --> 02:11:41.420]   I know it comes from an intrinsic drive.
[02:11:41.420 --> 02:11:45.060]   Your love of skateboarding, it just absolutely comes through.
[02:11:45.060 --> 02:11:48.980]   I share in some of that, of course, having grown up in it,
[02:11:48.980 --> 02:11:50.540]   but not nearly as much as you,
[02:11:50.540 --> 02:11:52.280]   but also just your willingness to stretch out
[02:11:52.280 --> 02:11:54.820]   into these different areas, like the video game thing,
[02:11:54.820 --> 02:11:59.020]   or talk about X Games, the Olympics,
[02:11:59.020 --> 02:12:01.500]   because that did allow for a lot of growth
[02:12:01.500 --> 02:12:04.260]   and lateral movement of skateboarding.
[02:12:04.260 --> 02:12:06.260]   And at the same time, just as you said,
[02:12:06.260 --> 02:12:07.380]   to bring it right back to the fact
[02:12:07.380 --> 02:12:08.620]   that skateboarding isn't one thing,
[02:12:08.620 --> 02:12:10.520]   it is not like other sports.
[02:12:10.520 --> 02:12:13.460]   It's its own sport and it's its own lifestyle.
[02:12:13.460 --> 02:12:14.620]   It's its own thing.
[02:12:14.620 --> 02:12:19.120]   And we do consider you the ambassador for skateboarding.
[02:12:19.120 --> 02:12:21.600]   And I speak for many people when I say
[02:12:21.600 --> 02:12:23.540]   that we're very grateful that you are,
[02:12:23.540 --> 02:12:26.620]   because you bring that shrewdness and that prudence to it,
[02:12:26.620 --> 02:12:30.000]   but also that get after it punk rock spirit
[02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:33.180]   and the goodness that your parents instilled in you
[02:12:33.180 --> 02:12:34.380]   clearly comes through everything
[02:12:34.380 --> 02:12:35.800]   from the philanthropy and onward.
[02:12:35.800 --> 02:12:38.200]   So I can't say enough positive things
[02:12:38.200 --> 02:12:40.400]   or express enough gratitude for what you've done
[02:12:40.400 --> 02:12:43.100]   and for your time here, your legacy in skateboarding,
[02:12:43.100 --> 02:12:46.460]   but also just in the game of life is clearly cemented.
[02:12:46.460 --> 02:12:47.300]   So thank you.
[02:12:47.300 --> 02:12:48.140]   - Oh, thank you.
[02:12:48.140 --> 02:12:52.080]   And I appreciate that the ethos of skateboarding
[02:12:52.080 --> 02:12:55.240]   shines through on your show and just your crew here.
[02:12:55.240 --> 02:12:59.180]   It's clearly a lot of them come from the skateboard world.
[02:12:59.180 --> 02:13:02.620]   So you're still supporting it, whether you know it or not.
[02:13:02.620 --> 02:13:03.460]   - Thanks so much.
[02:13:03.460 --> 02:13:06.080]   And hopefully you'll come back and we'll do it again.
[02:13:06.080 --> 02:13:08.900]   - All right, sounds good.
[02:13:08.900 --> 02:13:09.740]   - Thank you for joining me

[02:13:42.940 --> 02:13:45.640]   Not on today's podcast, but on many previous episodes
[02:13:45.640 --> 02:13:48.180]   of the Huberman Lab podcast, we discuss supplements.
[02:13:48.180 --> 02:13:50.320]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[02:13:50.320 --> 02:13:52.460]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[02:13:52.460 --> 02:13:55.900]   for things like improving sleep, hormone support, and focus.
[02:13:55.900 --> 02:13:57.700]   The Huberman Lab podcast has partnered
[02:13:57.700 --> 02:13:58.840]   with Momentous Supplements.
[02:13:58.840 --> 02:14:00.580]   If you'd like to access the supplements discussed

[02:14:31.220 --> 02:14:34.040]   We talk about deliberate cold exposure, fitness,
[02:14:34.040 --> 02:14:35.300]   various aspects of mental health.

[02:14:50.400 --> 02:14:53.380]   So that's Instagram, Twitter, Threads, LinkedIn,
[02:14:53.380 --> 02:14:55.980]   and Facebook, and at all of those places,
[02:14:55.980 --> 02:14:57.980]   I talk about science and science related tools,
[02:14:57.980 --> 02:14:59.520]   some of which overlaps with the content
[02:14:59.520 --> 02:15:00.620]   of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[02:15:00.620 --> 02:15:02.860]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[02:15:02.860 --> 02:15:04.060]   of the Huberman Lab podcast.
[02:15:04.060 --> 02:15:07.200]   Again, it's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[02:15:07.200 --> 02:15:08.960]   Thank you for joining me for today's discussion

[02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.020]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:15:12.020 --> 02:15:13.980]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:15:13.980 --> 02:15:16.560]   (upbeat music)
[02:15:16.560 --> 02:15:19.140]   (upbeat music)
