[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.640]   Here's an email from a listener who writes, "My name is Sarah and I admire your ministry.
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.920]   I'm 19 and have listened to your sermons off and on throughout the last two years and they
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.080]   have really helped me desire God more.
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.220]   I am learning what it means to delight in Jesus and I attend a Christian university
[00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.820]   and have felt called to do something in ministry or evangelism.
[00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.000]   My question is how, as a woman, can I work in ministry and evangelism while abiding by
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.160]   biblical rules and instructions for women, i.e., not having authority over a man?
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.760]   Pastor John, I would love if you could answer this because I am confused."
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:44.800]   Amen, amen, amen that she feels called to ministry and evangelism or whatever.
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:52.080]   I just want to so affirm that women and men are ministers.
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:58.520]   In no way does any biblical view of manhood and womanhood imply that men are out and about
[00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:04.040]   being active for Jesus and women are not out and about being active for Jesus or in and
[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.600]   about being active for Jesus and their families.
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.680]   So amen to the question.
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:19.800]   I would really encourage her or any of the other women who are asking questions, I've
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.960]   tried, along with Wayne Grudem, to ask 50 crucial questions.
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:24.960]   That's the booklet.
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.440]   You can get a free PDF of it at DesiringGod or you can buy the booklet at Amazon.
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:37.640]   50 crucial questions in which I try to answer that question and 49 others.
[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.760]   But here are just a few pointers.
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:48.240]   First, Sarah is right to care about both things, dreaming ministry and honoring God's pattern
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:55.840]   of how men and women relate to each other in all of life, both home and church and society.
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:04.800]   And she's right that the Bible is not as unclear as some people think it is on 1 Timothy 2:13.
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.600]   "I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over men.
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:17.800]   Rather, she is to remain in quietness as she learns."
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:24.320]   Those two things, teach and exercise authority, are the very two things that distinguish an
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.920]   elder from a deacon.
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.800]   Elders are to exercise authority or govern and elders are to be the authoritative teachers
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.800]   in the church.
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:41.300]   So what Paul seems to be saying here is that there should be male elders in the church.
[00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:50.680]   But all teaching and not all authority are restricted from women in that verse.
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.280]   It's over men.
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:03:00.800]   There's a kind of authoritative teaching over men that is referred to there and it compromises
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:08.000]   the way God has wired men and women when women over time become the authority in a man's
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   spiritual life.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   I really believe that.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.280]   I think that's why Paul put that there.
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.920]   It undermines something deep in both the man and the woman.
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:25.480]   But there are endless possibilities for ministry for women in this world that do not put them
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.120]   under or into that position.
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.760]   I wrote another little booklet called "What's the Difference?"
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:38.560]   And at the end of that booklet, I put 80 kinds of ministries just to give women examples
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.840]   of what kinds of things are open to them.
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.560]   Let me close with a story.
[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:52.920]   As I've talked over the years in various places on manhood and womanhood issues, back in the
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:04:01.220]   80s, I would get a lot more vicious negative flack than I do today.
[00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:08.160]   And one of the, I can remember one young woman really angry at me saying, "How dare you call
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.520]   my calling to ministry into question?"
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.800]   And instead of saying to her what I might have said, like, "I'm not calling it into
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:19.800]   question.
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:20.800]   God is calling it into question."
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:21.800]   I didn't go there.
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:32.200]   I just said, "You know, it may be that you haven't misheard the voice of God, but that
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.840]   you've misapplied the voice that you heard.
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:42.640]   In other words, maybe God is saying to you, 'Follow me.
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:43.780]   Serve me.
[00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.040]   Give your whole self to me.
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:51.280]   I'm going to use you mightily in my purposes on the earth to glorify myself and to save
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.760]   sinners and to build up saints.
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.800]   I'm going to use you for that.'
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.600]   And then you maybe took it and spun that out in terms of, 'Oh, I guess I'm supposed to
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.400]   be a pastor and have authority over men in that role.'
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.200]   And I just said, "Maybe not.
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.200]   Maybe you've just misread the word."
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:17.560]   And then when they say, "Well, what are you saying we can do?"
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:26.000]   My answer is, "Seventy-five percent of the seven billion people in the world"—I just
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.960]   checked this to make sure this is a true statement—"Seventy-five percent of the seven billion people in the
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:40.560]   world are women or under the age of 15.
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.040]   They have limitless needs of every kind, right?
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:52.920]   Physical needs and education needs and spiritual needs and relational needs and parenting needs
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:57.680]   and needs for rescue and endless needs that they have."
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.920]   And my response is, "Do anything you want.
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:03.400]   Care about them.
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:09.560]   Care about them physically and especially eternally, and minister in whatever way you
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:10.560]   can."
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.520]   Yes, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:17.480]   And once again, those books were titled "Fifty Crucial Questions About Manhood and Womanhood,"
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:18.880]   and "What's the Difference?"
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.640]   The list of ministry opportunities for women can also be found in an article Pastor John
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.500]   wrote titled "A Challenge to Women."
[00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:28.280]   It was published on January 1, 1995.
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:31.480]   The two books in the article can all be found for free at DesiringGod.org.
[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.400]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:34.000]   Thanks for listening.
