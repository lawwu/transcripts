[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.960]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.720]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.400]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.320]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I'm excited you're here
[00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.760]   because today we're gonna talk about confidence.
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.960]   It's a term I'm sure you're familiar with,
[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.600]   but you might have trouble having it,
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.280]   building it, or using it.
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.960]   And here with me today is Dr. Aziz Gazipura,
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.240]   who's one of the world's leading confidence experts,
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.120]   and we're gonna talk about how you can use confidence
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.560]   to your advantage to become successful in your career,
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.800]   relationships, and life in general.
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.040]   Dr. Aziz has combined academic training
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.800]   in clinical psychology with real-world experiences
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.600]   to help us break free from the grip of social anxiety
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.700]   and unlock our true potential.
[00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.320]   We'll cover a range of topics,
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.160]   including the concept of social freedom
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.840]   and how one can benefit from it,
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.280]   how to be better at decision-making
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.720]   in a world of so many ways to optimize.
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.280]   We'll debunk myths around confidence and being nice,
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.560]   which is often driven by people-pleasing.
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.160]   And we'll also discuss how parents can teach their kids
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.620]   to become more self-confident
[00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.480]   and develop healthy social skills
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.600]   so they too can live a more authentic and fulfilling life.
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.240]   I am really excited about this one,
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.420]   so let's jump in right after this.
[00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.440]   I wish I could say I'm eating a fully balanced diet
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.760]   every day, but the reality is that I'm not.
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.040]   So I love having an easy way
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.240]   to get my daily nutritional insurance,
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.920]   which is why I always kickstart my day with AG1,
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.840]   and I'm excited to be partnering with them for this episode.
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.140]   AG1 has been in my routine for over a year
[00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.880]   because just one daily serving
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.880]   gives me the comprehensive foundational nutrition I need
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.760]   and supports energy, focus, strength, and clarity
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.540]   with 75 high-quality vitamins, probiotics,
[00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.400]   and whole food sourced ingredients.
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.640]   So it can completely replace
[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.040]   your multivitamin, probiotics, and more.
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.880]   Every morning, I mix it up with some water,
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.520]   add a few ice cubes because it's so good cold,
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.280]   and I head to my office feeling focused
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.800]   and energized for the day,
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.200]   which is a feeling I absolutely love.
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.520]   I also love that AG1 is raising the standard
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.560]   for quality in the supplement category
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.360]   with less than one gram of sugar,
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.080]   no GMOs, no nasty chemicals, or artificial anything.
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.460]   So if you're looking for a simpler,
[00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.380]   effective investment in your health,
[00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.040]   try AG1 and get five free AG1 travel packs
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.480]   and a free one-year supply of vitamin D
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:10.960]   with your first purchase.
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.520]   Go to allthehacks.com/AG1.
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.520]   That's allthehacks.com/AG and the number one.
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.880]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.460]   - Aziz, thanks for being here.
[00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.300]   - I'm glad to be here.
[00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.140]   - Thank you, Chris.
[00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.160]   - I think most of us know what confidence is
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.320]   or what it feels like,
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.940]   but I think it'd be good to start this conversation off
[00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.080]   by just having you define it for us.
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.920]   - My favorite definition is going straight
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.440]   to the root in Latin, which is confides,
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.880]   which means with faith,
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.680]   which is pretty broad, with faith,
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.400]   but it's like faith in what?
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.920]   Well, you can have self-confidence.
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.520]   I believe in myself.
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.400]   That would be called self-efficacy in psychology.
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.800]   I believe I'm effective.
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.000]   I believe I can do that.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.160]   If you've been a mechanic for a bunch of years,
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.420]   you have self-confidence that you can fix a car,
[00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.220]   but then there's also social confidence.
[00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.060]   Are you able to talk to people?
[00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.820]   Are you able to connect with them?
[00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.620]   And then we can also have confidence in our careers,
[00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.260]   in our romantic life, but in any area of your life,
[00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.000]   do you have faith in yourself?
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.580]   Do you have faith in possibly something beyond you
[00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.060]   in the future in which you can create?
[00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.420]   But that's really at its root what it is.
[00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.540]   It's really just a belief in you
[00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:20.780]   or in something going the way
[00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.060]   that you think you can create it.
[00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.000]   - And what do you think most people are getting wrong
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.960]   when they think about their own confidence?
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.520]   - Their confidence is very contextual
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.800]   based upon the circumstances of their life.
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.060]   They make money, the job goes well, the deal goes through.
[00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.960]   They feel more confident.
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:35.840]   The person likes you.
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.960]   You get the positive response on social media
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.620]   or someone's like, "I think your work is great,"
[00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.080]   or someone wants to go on a date with you,
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.040]   and you're like, "Yeah," and your confidence goes up.
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.560]   And then rejection, setback, bad day,
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.340]   challenge, confidence goes down.
[00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.040]   Most people are kind of riding that current up and down,
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.160]   and they fail to realize
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.080]   that confidence is actually an inside job.
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.700]   I mean, sure, we're affected by circumstances,
[00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.680]   but it doesn't have to be a buoy
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.920]   on the surface of the water.
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.680]   You can actually choose and practice tools and habits
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.280]   to sustain higher unconditional confidence
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.080]   that doesn't require your circumstances
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.920]   to be in your favor.
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.760]   How often are they always in our favor?
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:13.800]   We don't have control over that.
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.440]   - You've said you can cultivate, nurture,
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.580]   and grow these habits.
[00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:17.420]   How do we do that?
[00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:19.360]   - Well, you gotta first know what the habits are, right?
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.440]   What are the habits of confidence?
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.460]   There's a handful of them that are gonna be the ones
[00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.160]   that get you the biggest bang for your buck.
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.960]   A lot of people might have heard of a few of them,
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.780]   but are we practicing them,
[00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.500]   and do we really know how to do them?
[00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:31.960]   I'm gonna distill it down just to two,
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.280]   'cause 10 is too many, just two.
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.000]   You do these, it's gonna change
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.960]   the lion's share of your confidence.
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.080]   One is inside at what you do,
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.180]   and one is what you practice in the world.
[00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.480]   On the inside, I call it being on your own side.
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.240]   That's a phrase that is basically how do you treat yourself
[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.560]   and how do you relate to yourself?
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.600]   We all have a relationship with ourselves,
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.160]   as well as with your family, your friends,
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.560]   your spouse, your kids, whatever.
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.560]   Then there's you and you.
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.000]   You're with you 24/7,
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.880]   and if you look inside of most people's heads,
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.300]   if you were to peel it back and observe,
[00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.480]   most people, even successful people,
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:09.400]   have a negative or toxic relationship with themselves.
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.680]   If you were to observe two humans at a restaurant
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.660]   talking to each other the way that you talk to yourself,
[00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.360]   you'd probably be disturbed.
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.720]   You'd be like, "Do I have to sit here?
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:19.880]   "Can I move tables?"
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.200]   It's critical, it's negative, it's predicting the worst,
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.840]   it's harping on things, it's nitpicking.
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.840]   This isn't just horribly low confidence.
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.960]   Most people are trying to push through that and ignore it,
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.880]   but it's dead weight on your confidence.
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.480]   So, you have to change your relationship with yourself,
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.520]   and we can talk more about how to do that.
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.640]   That's the first habit, to be on your own side,
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.040]   to treat yourself like someone you actually love
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.920]   and to learn how to optimize the way you coach yourself.
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.580]   Most people are very bad at that.
[00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.760]   The second side is you have to consistently build
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.460]   the muscle of confidence,
[00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.960]   which is a byproduct of bold action.
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.560]   You take bold action in the world, you will grow muscle.
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.040]   Just like if you lift weights and push it to the edge,
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.240]   it's the same thing with confidence.
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.080]   If you do it scares you,
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.280]   then the byproduct of that is confidence.
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.680]   If you combine those two and practice those regularly,
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.280]   you can have high sustained confidence through any season.
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.720]   - Funny how so many of these big things in life
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.160]   seem to be able to be distilled into two things.
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.680]   We had a conversation with Vanessa Van Edwards on Charisma,
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:18.520]   and she's like,
[00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.720]   "It's a balance between warmth and competence."
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.260]   If you can master those two things
[00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:23.260]   and the balance between them.
[00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:24.460]   I wanna dig into this, right?
[00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.580]   Why is this not so obvious?
[00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.340]   Why are we all walking around beating ourselves up
[00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:30.840]   and not taking bold actions?
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.340]   Is it that people don't know that's what you need to do
[00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:34.700]   and that's your life's work?
[00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:36.620]   Or is it that it's actually really hard
[00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:37.880]   and there are easier ways to do it?
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:38.720]   Or maybe it's both.
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:39.560]   - Great question.
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.860]   I think a lot of people, if you ask them,
[00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.060]   "Are those things good to do?"
[00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.580]   They'd be like, "Oh yeah, just like eating my vegetables,
[00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.980]   working out every day, spending time slowing down,
[00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:50.060]   unplugging from my phone and connecting with my spouse.
[00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:50.900]   It's great."
[00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:52.260]   But are we doing all those things, right?
[00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:53.720]   And the reason we don't,
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.680]   just like we don't do all those other healthy habits,
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:56.520]   maybe some people do,
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.740]   but the reason it's a challenge to do something
[00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:00.380]   that sounds very simple
[00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:03.780]   is because there's an emotional driver
[00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:05.520]   underneath the surface.
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.220]   And each one has a payoff.
[00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:08.380]   I start with a bold action.
[00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:12.180]   There's a huge set of payoffs for not taking bold action.
[00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:14.580]   One of the payoffs is we get to avoid the thing
[00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:17.500]   that everyone by default is trying to avoid in life,
[00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:18.340]   which is pain.
[00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:19.500]   When we take a bold action,
[00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.140]   we're going to experience a variety of forms of pain.
[00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:23.540]   Some of it's just discomfort.
[00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:26.060]   To wake up, to focus, to take the action,
[00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:27.540]   to consistently follow up.
[00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:28.860]   There's a discomfort to that.
[00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:31.220]   And there's an emotional discomfort of
[00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.280]   what if they don't like my show?
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.420]   What if someone doesn't agree with me?
[00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:36.540]   What if someone criticizes?
[00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:38.340]   What if my work's not good enough?
[00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:39.500]   What if I'm rejected?
[00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:40.420]   It all comes down to that.
[00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:43.380]   Most people are so afraid of that
[00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.520]   and even unconsciously avoiding that,
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.900]   they push the action to later.
[00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.260]   They make it way smaller.
[00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:50.100]   They delay it.
[00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:50.920]   They hesitate.
[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:52.580]   And they don't even necessarily know
[00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:53.660]   that's what we're doing, right?
[00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:54.940]   It's just like, no, I'm busy.
[00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:57.060]   But underneath, I'm scared.
[00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:58.540]   We want to look macho.
[00:07:58.540 --> 00:07:59.820]   We don't want to say we're scared.
[00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:01.640]   So, we say I'm stressed and I'm too busy.
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.860]   That's the payoff for the bold action.
[00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:06.020]   You might say, what is the payoff for treating yourself bad?
[00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:07.420]   Obviously, that's terrible.
[00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:10.780]   I would say that it actually serves the same master.
[00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:13.400]   When I tell myself, it's gonna fail.
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:14.240]   I'm not good.
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.200]   I didn't do that right.
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:18.000]   That's creating a fog, an amnesia.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.620]   I forget my strengths.
[00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:20.460]   I'm sure you've done that.
[00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:21.280]   I've done that.
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:22.700]   It's two in the morning and the way you're seeing yourself
[00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:25.440]   is like this helpless, incompetent person.
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:26.280]   Wait a minute.
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.100]   That's weird.
[00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:27.940]   Why am I even believing this?
[00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:29.620]   Because the more we believe that,
[00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:33.440]   we stay in protective walls of this negative identity.
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:34.280]   I'm a nobody.
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:35.100]   Who am I?
[00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:37.940]   I'm a nobody who's nothing is even further
[00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:39.420]   from taking that bold action.
[00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:41.500]   All of this is under the umbrella
[00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:43.420]   of what I call your safety police,
[00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:45.460]   which is a mechanism in your psychology.
[00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:47.540]   Its purpose is single fold.
[00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:48.900]   It is to keep you safe.
[00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:51.340]   The safety police is a survival mechanism inside
[00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:52.180]   that's run amok.
[00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:53.660]   It's the dial is set too high.
[00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:56.580]   Safety means no pain, no rejection,
[00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:59.220]   no threat, no danger, no risk.
[00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:02.340]   You tell yourself you're a nobody and you avoid the action
[00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:04.500]   and you get to stay in that bubble,
[00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.900]   which feels safer in the moment.
[00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:09.140]   Of course, meanwhile, your life is passing you by.
[00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:10.620]   - Seems like both of those are a little bit
[00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:12.260]   like a voice in your head,
[00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.100]   this inner critic that is controlling you.
[00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:17.500]   Is that a fair assumption?
[00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:18.320]   - Yes.
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:19.160]   The inner critic you could think of
[00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:20.840]   as the mouthpiece of the safety police.
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:22.180]   It's the one who's narrating.
[00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:24.020]   The crazy thing is why do people believe it?
[00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:25.780]   It's almost because it's familiar
[00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:28.780]   and also because it has proximity.
[00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:30.020]   It's coming from in your head.
[00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:31.880]   It's closer than your closest friend.
[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:33.860]   And so, okay, I guess that's true.
[00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:34.900]   I'll often do that with clients.
[00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:36.540]   I'm like, where is that voice coming from?
[00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:37.380]   And they're like, what do you mean?
[00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:38.260]   It's from my childhood.
[00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:39.140]   I'm like, no, right now.
[00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:40.340]   How are you even hearing that thing?
[00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:42.220]   And then it's like a confusing mindfulness question.
[00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:44.220]   They're like, I don't know, right?
[00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:45.600]   But it's close.
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.500]   And all of a sudden we assume because it's close
[00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:49.820]   and we've heard it a lot that it's true.
[00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:51.900]   This is one of the tools I help clients break free with.
[00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:55.460]   If you pay attention to its track record of predictions,
[00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:56.340]   it's really bad.
[00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:57.580]   Oh, you're going to fail at that meeting.
[00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:58.820]   No one's going to buy the thing.
[00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:00.900]   You go there and it goes okay and people buy the thing.
[00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:02.340]   That person would never go out with you.
[00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:03.700]   And the person goes out with you, right?
[00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:05.420]   Maybe not that one, but the next one.
[00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:07.940]   Think about that if you had like a financial advisor
[00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:09.100]   and they couldn't beat the market.
[00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:10.860]   They were wrong all the time.
[00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:12.180]   And you just keep going back to them.
[00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:13.620]   You're like, what do you think this time?
[00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:15.740]   They're just so certain that you keep going to it.
[00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:17.500]   And I think that's how we are with the inner critic.
[00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:19.580]   - So what do we do with both of these areas
[00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:20.540]   and what are the tactics?
[00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:21.380]   - Great question.
[00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:22.940]   A lot of people, when they discover this,
[00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:24.300]   they're like, how do I kill the critic, right?
[00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:26.840]   It's the enemy, slay the demon.
[00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:28.340]   I don't think it works that way.
[00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:30.380]   You can think of the parts of our psychology
[00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:32.100]   as that old show survivor.
[00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:34.180]   You can't vote them off the island.
[00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:36.140]   They actually are a part in there.
[00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:38.680]   The problem is not the survivor and the safety police.
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:40.060]   The problem is the dial.
[00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:41.440]   The setting is too high.
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:43.380]   You do need some survival skills.
[00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:45.740]   That prevents you from jumping off the 30 foot building
[00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:46.980]   and breaking your legs.
[00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:49.260]   You have a sense of risk and all that.
[00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.900]   The issue is that we need to turn the dial down.
[00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:53.580]   The first thing that people have to do
[00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:56.180]   is even know this conversation that we're having exists
[00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:58.420]   and say, wait a minute, it's not just me, Aziz,
[00:10:58.420 --> 00:10:59.260]   or you, Chris.
[00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:00.220]   There's a lot of parts inside.
[00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:01.700]   And one of the parts is this inner critic.
[00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:02.860]   The first thing I do with people is,
[00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:04.500]   can you know when your critic is talking?
[00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:07.420]   Do you know when it's you thinking versus the critic?
[00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:08.740]   Now, we don't have to get crazy.
[00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:11.620]   It's philosophical, like what is me, right?
[00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:14.580]   But are you seeing clearly?
[00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:16.860]   Are you having a distorted view of yourself
[00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:18.740]   as incapable and unlovable?
[00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:21.500]   You'll start to hear the critic and get better at it
[00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:23.540]   because it's languages and extremes.
[00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:25.520]   It's gonna go awful.
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:27.420]   Everyone's gonna think you're terrible.
[00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:30.380]   It magnifies, it's a fun house mirror.
[00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:32.940]   One is identify the critic and just get good at it.
[00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:35.100]   With clients, I'll have them do an awareness exercise
[00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:37.260]   usually for a week or two where they're noting it,
[00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:38.100]   tracking it.
[00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:38.940]   I'll have them name it too.
[00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:40.460]   Some people just call it the critic.
[00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:42.100]   Some people come up with these like pretty funny,
[00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:45.340]   creative, silly names just to break the pattern
[00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:46.180]   a little bit.
[00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:47.280]   You start to name it.
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:50.300]   Then the biggest technique you could call it
[00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:52.940]   is not some hack to know what to say.
[00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:54.760]   It actually is deeper than that.
[00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:57.240]   You have to make what I call the decision of a lifetime.
[00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:58.380]   I have a book called "On My Own Side,"
[00:11:58.380 --> 00:11:59.540]   which is guiding people through this.
[00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:01.160]   And you're aware of this critic.
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:02.000]   It's all the time.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:02.820]   I can name it.
[00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:03.660]   I can see it now.
[00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:04.500]   Okay, great.
[00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:06.420]   Take a moment and really pay attention
[00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:07.300]   to what's happening here.
[00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:08.620]   Observe it for a while.
[00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:10.820]   Hopefully there's some part inside of you.
[00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:11.820]   Like when you watch a movie,
[00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:13.140]   what's that one with Leonardo DiCaprio
[00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:15.440]   and Robert De Niro from way back in the day?
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:17.160]   Some terrible, abusive stepfather.
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:18.340]   When you're watching that movie
[00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:20.460]   and you're identifying with the young character,
[00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:24.460]   every part of your body wants that young son
[00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:27.220]   or character to stand up to that tyrant
[00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:29.020]   and say, "This is effed up.
[00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:30.220]   I'm leaving your house.
[00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:31.060]   I'm out.
[00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:31.880]   I'm done."
[00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:34.220]   Basically, people have to have that moment
[00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:35.200]   inside of themselves.
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:37.580]   Because what happens is that the critic's beating them up
[00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:38.740]   and they're believing it.
[00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:39.880]   And they're like, "Okay, I caught it.
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:41.240]   Now what do I do?"
[00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:43.460]   But the energy is not there.
[00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:46.380]   You need to have a revolution inside.
[00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:48.680]   You need to usurp the power of the critic
[00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:50.860]   and take control of your inner self
[00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:52.620]   and be the captain of your ship, as I call it.
[00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:55.380]   That means the critic is the parent kicking you around.
[00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:56.540]   You need to become the parent.
[00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:57.380]   It's a decision.
[00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:59.860]   And the decision comes from reaching a threshold moment
[00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:01.660]   of really observing, "This is effed up.
[00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:02.500]   What is this?
[00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:03.500]   What am I doing to myself?"
[00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:05.620]   You gotta have this sense of almost outrage
[00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:07.740]   or disgust or revulsion or something.
[00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:08.620]   You say, "All right, that's it.
[00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:10.200]   I'm gonna take control here."
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.220]   Because otherwise, before that decision,
[00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:13.980]   it always goes like this.
[00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:14.860]   And I see this all the time.
[00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:16.420]   People go to cognitive therapy.
[00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:18.060]   They teach them how to deal with their negative thoughts,
[00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:18.900]   which is their critic.
[00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:20.460]   They'll write out the critical thoughts.
[00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:22.180]   "You're a loser or nobody likes you."
[00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:23.700]   And they're like, "Okay, what do I do?"
[00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:25.740]   The therapist is like, "Challenge the thought."
[00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:28.100]   And they're like, "Okay, I'm good.
[00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:30.000]   And many people do like me.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:30.840]   Is that right?"
[00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:34.300]   It's got no power because they're still framed,
[00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:37.460]   still living within the reality created by their critic.
[00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:39.060]   They still see themselves that way.
[00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:41.100]   We have to shatter that
[00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:42.980]   and be willing to see what's really true.
[00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:44.940]   And I could go deeper and more granular, but I'll pause.
[00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:48.740]   - I'm curious how applicable this is to everyone.
[00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:51.420]   Or is this for people who found themselves so deep
[00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:52.700]   that they have no confidence?
[00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:54.700]   Because I imagine there's some people listening
[00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:56.020]   that don't necessarily feel
[00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:57.220]   like they don't have confidence.
[00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:59.020]   They're willing to go to a meeting
[00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:00.980]   and feel like they're gonna do a great job,
[00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:02.940]   but it could probably level up as well.
[00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:05.660]   I'm curious if you address some of the tactics
[00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:07.700]   you said make me feel like I'm not even sure
[00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:09.020]   I'm at that point yet.
[00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:12.140]   However, I have no doubt that there is something
[00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:13.600]   to be learned for everyone.
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.340]   So how does this calibrate for people?
[00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:17.820]   - This doesn't have to mean that you're impaired
[00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:19.540]   to the point where you can't go into that meeting.
[00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:21.640]   But a lot of people, the morning of the meeting,
[00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:23.260]   they're short with their spouse.
[00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:24.100]   They're stressed out.
[00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:25.380]   Like, I got that meeting.
[00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:26.740]   I think if you look at a lot of people,
[00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:29.180]   there's some fear underneath.
[00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:32.100]   And the fear is this has to go good or else.
[00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:33.340]   They might say, I'm gonna crush it.
[00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:35.220]   I'm gonna just nail it, maybe.
[00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:36.060]   Now that's great.
[00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:37.620]   Then you could observe what are you doing?
[00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:40.360]   You're probably reinforcing an identity,
[00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:42.140]   how you see yourself of capability.
[00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:43.700]   I got this, I can do this.
[00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:44.700]   And you know what that is?
[00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:46.660]   Their critic has been swapped out
[00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:48.680]   with what I would call an optimal self-coach.
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:50.200]   That's a process that you can observe.
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:52.020]   Even if your critic's not terrible,
[00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:53.260]   you gotta start listening to it.
[00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:54.980]   You could ask this question before a meeting.
[00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:56.040]   Am I nervous?
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:57.160]   What am I telling myself?
[00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:58.140]   This is a great question.
[00:14:58.140 --> 00:14:59.940]   Who's coaching me in my head right now?
[00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:02.480]   And you could say, what would an optimal coach say?
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.460]   Think back if you've ever had a sports coach
[00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:06.980]   when you were young or a life coach as you got older
[00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:09.720]   or someone who was a mentor or a guide
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:11.900]   who actually fulfilled that role for you.
[00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:13.140]   What would they say?
[00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:14.500]   How would they perceive this?
[00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:17.820]   And you can start to tap into that and draw on that.
[00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:19.060]   But I would say that there's still often
[00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:20.480]   a layer of fear underneath.
[00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:22.860]   And that fear is some level of,
[00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:25.820]   if this doesn't go well, then dot, dot, dot.
[00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:27.180]   I think the next level,
[00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:29.500]   if you wanna talk about extraordinary confidence,
[00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:32.180]   it's the people that are willing to face that
[00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:35.460]   and to go into any scenario of life,
[00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:38.140]   even the stuff that we would never want to occur,
[00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:40.740]   and to not say, oh great, I hope that happens,
[00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:41.660]   but to say, you know what?
[00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:43.260]   If that happens, I'll be okay too.
[00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:44.520]   I know I can handle anything.
[00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:46.760]   That's when you get to a certain level of confidence
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:48.160]   where you're able to move through life
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:52.060]   without that roller coaster of fear and up and down.
[00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:53.660]   (air whooshing)
[00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:55.460]   Even if you're responsible with money
[00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:57.420]   and always spend less than you make,
[00:15:57.420 --> 00:16:01.020]   having a grasp of your cashflow has so many benefits,
[00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:03.780]   from spotting expenses that you definitely need to cut,
[00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:06.180]   to being able to better forecast your net worth,
[00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:07.980]   or even just being able to ask yourself
[00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:09.420]   whether you're really aligning
[00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:12.300]   the way you spend your money with your own priorities.
[00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:14.280]   This has always been so hard for me
[00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:16.100]   until I started using Copilot,
[00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:18.300]   which is one of my all-time favorite apps.
[00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:20.900]   And I am so excited to finally be partnering with them
[00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:22.820]   after being such a huge fan.
[00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:25.660]   Copilot makes it seamless and easy to track your spending
[00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:27.780]   and ultimately boost your savings.
[00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:29.620]   I've tried dozens of apps that do this
[00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:32.180]   and Copilot is the only one I've kept using.
[00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:34.940]   You can link accounts at over 10,000 institutions
[00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:37.100]   and their automatic expense categorization
[00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:38.580]   is the best I've used,
[00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:40.960]   with custom Amazon and Venmo integrations
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:42.380]   to make it even better.
[00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:44.860]   You can completely design your spending categories
[00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:47.740]   and easily set up rules to auto-assign transactions
[00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:48.940]   to them in the future.
[00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:51.380]   Thanks to Copilot, I've never had a better grasp
[00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:53.160]   on my spending and cashflow,
[00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:54.000]   which by the way,
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.220]   also means I can leave less money in our checking account
[00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:59.380]   and more somewhere else where it earns a lot more interest.
[00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:01.500]   So for the best app to track your spending,
[00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:03.100]   subscription and investments,
[00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:07.260]   go to allthehacks.com/copilot to download Copilot
[00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:10.020]   and use code HACKS2 during onboarding
[00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:11.820]   for a two-month free trial.
[00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:14.660]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/copilot
[00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:17.900]   and the code HACKS2 for a free two-month trial
[00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:20.260]   of my favorite personal finance app.
[00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:24.540]   Parents, it's no secret that you have people
[00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:25.580]   who rely on you,
[00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:28.100]   but do you have life insurance so they're protected?
[00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:29.700]   Don't wait until it's too late
[00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:31.140]   with Fabric by Gerber Life,

[00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:50.860]   I actually went online to compare prices
[00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:53.340]   and found that Fabric was highly competitive
[00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:55.940]   with great policies like a million dollars in coverage

[00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:23.300]   Policies issued by Western Southern Life Assurance Company,
[00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:25.060]   not available in certain states,
[00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:28.300]   prices subject to underwriting and health questions.
[00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:30.100]   Whether you have no confidence or a lot of it,
[00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:31.260]   sounds like you could have more
[00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:33.780]   and the impact on your life of having more would be great.
[00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:35.420]   So you just need to confront
[00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:37.380]   and stand up to this inner critic.
[00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:39.580]   Are there more habits to build
[00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:41.700]   or types of coaching to keep it going?
[00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:43.300]   'Cause it seems like it'd be easy one morning
[00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:44.300]   to be like, you know what, forget it.
[00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:45.180]   This is gonna be great,
[00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:47.140]   but that doesn't mean that it's gonna last forever.
[00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:48.060]   - Here's a simple one.
[00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:50.100]   I think it's helpful when you think about what habits to do,
[00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:51.660]   what's the outcome, what are we trying to do?
[00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:52.940]   And you say, I'm trying to build my confidence.
[00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:56.860]   Yes, but when your identity is expanded enough
[00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:58.460]   for whatever it is you're trying to do,
[00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:00.100]   you don't need to pep talk yourself.
[00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:00.980]   So I'm sure there's things
[00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:02.740]   that you can do something in your life.
[00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:03.900]   You don't have to think about it as confidence
[00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:05.740]   'cause you've just done it so many times
[00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:06.860]   that it's no big deal.
[00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:09.420]   Is there anything in your life like a hobby or a work task?
[00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:10.500]   I know you do a lot of travel.
[00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:12.300]   For some people, travel is overwhelming.
[00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:13.380]   My God, where would I even go?
[00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:14.780]   I don't know if that even feels that way to you
[00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:15.620]   at this point.
[00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:16.940]   - I don't stress out.
[00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:18.260]   We're taking this trip we talked about
[00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:19.980]   right before we started in a couple of weeks.
[00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:21.660]   And we have no idea where we're going.
[00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:23.620]   I know a lot of people will be very overwhelmed
[00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:24.900]   going on a trip for a week.
[00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:26.620]   In two weeks, we have no idea what we're doing.
[00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:29.260]   I just know that we're gonna be able to find a great trip.
[00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:30.340]   It doesn't even bother me.
[00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:32.260]   My wife's like, well, I might need to buy some clothes
[00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:33.660]   if it's gonna be cold or warm.
[00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:35.860]   So it'd be good to know on more than a day's notice.
[00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:37.420]   But for me, I'm like, I have warm clothes,
[00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:38.260]   I have cold clothes.
[00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:39.940]   I'm pretty confident we'll have a good trip.
[00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:42.540]   - You can hear there's like a relaxed sense of certainty
[00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:43.380]   around that.
[00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:44.540]   A lot of people wouldn't have that.
[00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:45.380]   I don't travel.
[00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:46.380]   I used to travel a lot when I was younger.
[00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:48.300]   I haven't traveled that much in the last seven, eight years.
[00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:50.500]   For me, I don't know if I'd be overstressed about it,
[00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:51.980]   but it would be more than you.
[00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:53.380]   'Cause there's something different there.
[00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:55.540]   What's the differentiating factor there?
[00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:57.100]   My sense is you probably traveled a lot.
[00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:59.220]   You do a show that involves travel, right?
[00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:01.460]   So you've expanded your identity.
[00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:04.620]   Chris includes travel.
[00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:07.060]   How did you expand the identity to include that?
[00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:08.580]   You weren't born that way.
[00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:10.660]   Did you grow up with world traveler parents?
[00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:11.500]   - A little bit, yeah.
[00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:13.100]   My grandparents traveled a lot.
[00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:15.300]   My parents traveled, we went places.
[00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:16.220]   So yes.
[00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:18.900]   - You had this exposure, practice,
[00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:21.140]   and it becomes familiar and normal
[00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:22.300]   for you to do that kind of thing.
[00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:24.420]   So now we're gonna go on a trip in a couple of weeks.
[00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:25.340]   No big deal.
[00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:26.900]   I had a buddy when I was young who was like
[00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:29.100]   straight out of a movie, Hacker Nerd Kids.
[00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:32.060]   And this was '97 or something, '95.
[00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:33.820]   Everything was simpler in a way.
[00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:35.100]   Computer systems, the internet.
[00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:36.380]   He could just furiously type
[00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:37.940]   and literally at the school library,
[00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:40.980]   be like in the administrator section of the school.
[00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:42.660]   I'm like, what are you doing?
[00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:43.500]   Right?
[00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:45.060]   Because he grew up on computers.
[00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:46.220]   He just knew how to do that stuff.
[00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:48.380]   What does all this have to do with confidence at work
[00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:49.540]   in our lives and that sort of thing
[00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:52.060]   is that we need to expand our identity
[00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:54.580]   so that we see ourselves as like, this is no big deal.
[00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:55.900]   This is normal for me.
[00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:58.100]   Otherwise it's always a, oh my God,
[00:20:58.100 --> 00:20:59.340]   am I gonna pull this off?
[00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:00.340]   I don't know.
[00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:02.300]   That whole, I don't know.
[00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:04.340]   That's a reflection that you don't see
[00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:06.700]   as a part of your normal identity yet.
[00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:08.340]   We want to expand our identity.
[00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:11.060]   The habits have to be expanding our identity to include that.
[00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:13.100]   One thing we can do is to do the thing, right?
[00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:14.540]   Start getting exposure to it.
[00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:17.340]   That sounds so simple, but if we're not great at it yet
[00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:20.780]   or it causes stress for us, we slow the process down.
[00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:22.220]   We're like, I'll get to that next month.
[00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:23.900]   I'll do it once in a while.
[00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:26.140]   The biggest change is gonna go on offense,
[00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:26.980]   I like to call it.
[00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:28.660]   Let's say you do okay at work meetings,
[00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:29.860]   but you want to own the room.
[00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:32.220]   You want to be a powerful force of leadership,
[00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:33.700]   speaking up and authority.
[00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:35.180]   So then you say, okay, I'm gonna have a commitment.
[00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:37.780]   Every single meeting, I'm gonna intentionally speak up
[00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:39.300]   and I'm gonna intentionally steer at once.
[00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:40.740]   I'm gonna intentionally ask a question.
[00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:41.940]   You start to build that.
[00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:43.100]   That's the action side.
[00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:45.180]   Now the habit that really strengthens that,
[00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:46.380]   it serves multiple purposes.
[00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:49.020]   It neutralizes the critic and it builds your optimal coach.
[00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:51.100]   And this one is right after the meeting is done,
[00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:52.940]   force yourself, don't just do it in your head,
[00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:55.460]   force yourself to do it on a note file on your phone
[00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:57.420]   or on a sheet of paper if you want to do it old school,
[00:21:57.420 --> 00:21:59.500]   where you write down three wins
[00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:00.940]   from the meeting right afterwards.
[00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:02.540]   What are three things that you did that went well?
[00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:05.100]   This is gonna really encode it into your identity.
[00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:06.940]   They say, well, I spoke up there, I did this.
[00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:08.860]   And it doesn't matter what you write down.
[00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:11.260]   It matters that you're training your brain to say,
[00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:13.620]   hey, when I go into these situations, I'm competent.
[00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:15.660]   Remember you were talking about Vanessa Van Edwards,
[00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:16.780]   competence and warmth, right?
[00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:18.360]   You say, I know I'm competent.
[00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:20.460]   Not all of you knows that all of the time.
[00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:21.940]   What this is doing is linking your brain.
[00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:23.020]   I'll do this with clients where I'll say,
[00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:25.060]   okay, write down three things like that a day.
[00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:25.900]   There was a man I worked with
[00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:27.340]   who is already very successful.
[00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:28.420]   He ran multiple companies,
[00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:29.420]   but he basically felt like
[00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:31.020]   he wasn't never successful enough.
[00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:33.580]   We started to do this because in his mind,
[00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:34.420]   at the end of the day,
[00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:37.140]   he cataloged all the things he didn't do well enough,
[00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:39.940]   even though he was successfully running three companies.
[00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:42.460]   With this practice, he started to simply write down
[00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:44.660]   three things at the end of each day that he did well.
[00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:46.780]   And within three weeks, a big shift happened.
[00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:48.260]   He's like, I was talking with my wife
[00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:49.780]   and in an offhand manner,
[00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:51.760]   I referred to myself as successful.
[00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:54.020]   And for him, this guy who runs three companies,
[00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:55.260]   multi-millionaire, for him,
[00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:56.820]   the moment that he knew he was a success
[00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:58.700]   was when he casually told his wife something
[00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:00.100]   implying he was successful.
[00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:02.020]   That's the power of upgrading your identity.
[00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:05.300]   - And is that making a point to speak up in a meeting
[00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:06.460]   or take charge?
[00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:10.060]   Is that the bold side of the two habits you wanted to build
[00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:11.340]   or is that something different?
[00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:12.820]   - Yes, that would be an example.
[00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:15.460]   For a number of people, that might be a challenge.
[00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:17.720]   Whatever the bold action, how do you know what it is?
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:20.760]   It's whatever makes you uncomfortable or scares you a lot.
[00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:22.900]   Generally, if it freaks you out,
[00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:24.300]   you probably have to work up to it.
[00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:25.820]   Think of it as weight training.
[00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:27.980]   You're not gonna just bench press 300 pounds
[00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:30.620]   if you can't bench press 150.
[00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:33.420]   Practice and repetition of the smaller amounts,
[00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:35.300]   that would be an example of bold action.
[00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:36.220]   - We went to a birthday party
[00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:37.420]   for a three-year-old this weekend
[00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:38.380]   and one of the parents said,
[00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:40.180]   "Oh, have you traveled with your kids?"
[00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:42.140]   And I was like, "Yeah, we went to London and Paris."
[00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:44.900]   And they're like, "Whoa, we could never do that."
[00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:46.860]   I was like, "Okay, then why don't you go for a weekend?"
[00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:47.940]   I was just trying to tell them,
[00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:49.140]   they're not gonna ever feel like
[00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:50.940]   they could travel with their kids as much as they want
[00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:51.940]   until they just do it.
[00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:54.660]   So I assume that is a little bit of what you have to do.
[00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:57.320]   You don't have to take an international trip right away,
[00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:59.460]   but maybe you just go somewhere for a night,
[00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:00.540]   go somewhere for a weekend.
[00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:02.060]   - Most people, in their mind,
[00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:03.540]   it's the hundred pound weight or nothing.
[00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:04.580]   Ah, we're gonna go international.
[00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:05.940]   We'll do it when they're teenagers.
[00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:07.060]   But what about the overnight?
[00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:08.260]   Ah, that's not enough.
[00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:09.100]   Ah, I don't know.
[00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:10.700]   And we all do this with the small stuff.
[00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:11.540]   Ah, I don't know.
[00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:14.540]   But really, that's the only way to get that confidence.
[00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:15.700]   - And when it comes to the inner critic,
[00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:17.820]   can you talk to me about what the difference is
[00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:19.980]   between planning for the worst
[00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:21.860]   and feeling like the worst is gonna happen?
[00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:24.260]   I think sometimes my wife and I have these debates
[00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:26.020]   where I'm like, "Everything's gonna be great."
[00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:27.400]   And she's like, "What if this happens?
[00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:28.520]   What if this happens?"
[00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:30.920]   And I don't actually think she's necessarily saying
[00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:32.360]   it's going to happen.
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:34.360]   She's just like, "We should be prepared
[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:36.120]   because if something does go wrong,
[00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:38.640]   we wanna make sure that we have a contingency, a plan,
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:40.600]   enough diapers, enough extra snacks."
[00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:42.160]   And I'm like, "Well, if the kids are hungry,
[00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:44.740]   we'll go find a store and buy some stuff and it'll be okay."
[00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:47.400]   I think we both realize that we balance each other out well
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:48.920]   'cause I'm like, "Nothing's gonna go wrong.
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:50.000]   Everything's gonna be perfect."
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.280]   I wouldn't say she says, "Everything's gonna go wrong."
[00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:54.520]   She just wants to make sure we're prepared if it does.
[00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:56.380]   - Not making this about my wife per se,
[00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:59.380]   but is that a self-critic or is that a preparedness
[00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:01.500]   or is there a blurry line between the two?
[00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:02.860]   - That's a great question.
[00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:05.740]   Also, similar dynamics between me and my wife.
[00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:09.460]   I don't know if that's roles or personality styles
[00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:13.040]   or male/female energy, but it's definitely like,
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:13.900]   "What do we need?
[00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:15.900]   Whatever, let's just grab, let's go."
[00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:19.180]   We've definitely been on hikes with my boys
[00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:20.740]   where we ran out of water and stuff.
[00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:21.980]   And I'm like, "Well, we survived."
[00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:23.900]   I think you're highlighting a great point here.
[00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:27.660]   It all comes back to risk and our willingness to take risk.
[00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:30.620]   Each person has a different level of risk tolerance.
[00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:32.580]   If someone's risk tolerance is a little lower,
[00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:33.740]   it doesn't mean it's bad.
[00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:35.540]   It might mean they're prepared, right?
[00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:37.300]   I'm not gonna take the risk of bringing nothing.
[00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:38.740]   Let's bring these three things
[00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:40.340]   so that we have some supplies.
[00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:41.380]   There's a downside to that.
[00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:42.220]   You gotta think of the things,
[00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:43.620]   you gotta carry them around, right?
[00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:45.260]   We all find our balance there.
[00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:47.260]   In day-to-day life, as you're describing,
[00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:49.220]   probably not too significant of an impact.
[00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:51.380]   I'd say the problem can come in
[00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:54.460]   when people start becoming less willing
[00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:57.120]   or even unwilling to tolerate risk.
[00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:58.960]   That would be your wife saying,
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:02.580]   "I can't go until I have three backpacks,
[00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:05.340]   diapers, foods, disaster supplies."
[00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:07.100]   You know, it starts to become really extreme.
[00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:08.600]   You might say, "Well, that's over the top."
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:10.020]   But people do that in their lives.
[00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:11.540]   I'm not gonna start my business
[00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:14.740]   until I have this lined up and I've achieved that.
[00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:16.460]   And I have X amount of money in the bank
[00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:17.980]   and this and that, and the kids are older,
[00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:19.660]   and now the business has never started.
[00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:22.260]   I'm not gonna have children until I got A, and B,
[00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:23.740]   and C, and D all lined up.
[00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:24.780]   And then they don't have children, right?
[00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:28.700]   People will avoid significant positive risks in their lives
[00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:31.540]   because they are unwilling to tolerate.
[00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:32.820]   And that's the key thing.
[00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:34.100]   To lean into the risk,
[00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:37.460]   we have to be able to tolerate uncertainty.
[00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:39.460]   The I don't know what's gonna happen.
[00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:42.320]   And the boogeyman that stops us from doing that
[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:43.860]   is the mind says, "We don't know."
[00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:46.700]   Could be awesome, could be fun, could be spontaneous.
[00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:48.460]   It could be death.
[00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:50.380]   It could be the terrible thing, right?
[00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:52.820]   And because of the human prediction machine
[00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:53.660]   that is our brain,
[00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:56.020]   it can, within a quarter of a second,
[00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:59.860]   imagine, see, and even feel like the death of your child
[00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:02.620]   or a financial ruin, which is pretty intense.
[00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:03.780]   You're sitting there eating your cereal
[00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:05.820]   and all of a sudden you go, "Ah, financial ruin," right?
[00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:07.980]   That's a significant emotional impact.
[00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:09.060]   What do you do with that?
[00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:11.900]   People that have anxiety or catastrophizing,
[00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:13.980]   we can really live in that place
[00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:16.700]   and start to imagine that's gonna happen.
[00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:19.640]   The key there is to take a step back.
[00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:22.060]   I would say, start with your nervous system.
[00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:24.180]   Are you ramped up?
[00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:25.780]   Are you breathing really rapidly?
[00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:27.700]   Are you shoveling junk food in your face?
[00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:30.520]   Take a moment, as simple as it might sound,
[00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:32.700]   take three breaths, slowly breathe in,
[00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:34.660]   and count to where you're breathing out
[00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:36.180]   longer than you're breathing in.
[00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:38.780]   And ask yourself, what kind of risk am I afraid of?
[00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:39.820]   What's the line here?
[00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:42.980]   Usually we can see there's a certain line that makes sense.
[00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:45.700]   At some point, we have to be willing to go into the what if
[00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:46.540]   and say, "You know what?
[00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:48.780]   The odds are very, very low that would happen,
[00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:51.260]   but if that would happen, let's face that."
[00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:52.940]   And I'm not saying you're really gonna have a kid die
[00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:54.640]   or something, but I mean like in that moment,
[00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:56.260]   you emotionally face it
[00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:59.900]   'cause the fear feeds on avoidance and flight.
[00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:02.780]   If you turn to face it, face the fear for just a moment,
[00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:05.900]   what you'll notice is that it gets really intense,
[00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:07.980]   but if you just let it rip through you
[00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:09.420]   without needing to do anything,
[00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:11.300]   the moment will pass, the storm will pass,
[00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:12.960]   and you're okay to take the step forward.
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:14.580]   The problem most people make is they're like,
[00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:16.180]   "But what if it leads to that?"
[00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:17.340]   And then they just stop.
[00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:19.020]   It's like getting to the edge of the cliff
[00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:20.340]   and not even looking down.
[00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:22.260]   What you need to do is become really mindful of the edge.
[00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:24.580]   And if you look at every catastrophic thought,
[00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:28.080]   it's all about loss, pain, and survival stuff.
[00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:31.380]   Underneath, we all know that this is impermanent.
[00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:33.540]   None of this stuff, we don't have control.
[00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:35.160]   We don't really know what's gonna happen.
[00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:37.420]   The people that we love, it's extraordinary
[00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:38.340]   and our hearts are bonded,
[00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:39.660]   but something could happen to anyone.
[00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:42.380]   Our lifestyles, everything is in flux and change.
[00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:44.460]   It might be steady for decades and then it might change.
[00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:45.300]   We know that.
[00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:47.260]   We're facing our catastrophic thoughts.
[00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:48.580]   We're facing impermanence.
[00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:50.220]   The problem is not that things are gonna change
[00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:51.980]   or that something "bad" could happen.
[00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:54.340]   The problem is that you are fighting it,
[00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:56.420]   racing against it, and unwilling.
[00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:59.900]   You're saying, "No, I do not sign that contract with life.
[00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:02.160]   "I will not accept that something unpleasant
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:03.060]   "could happen to me."
[00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:04.500]   And you clench everything inside.
[00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:06.740]   You get anxious and it doesn't do anything.
[00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:07.900]   It's not like the universe is like,
[00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:09.400]   "He's really tight in his bowels.
[00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:11.080]   "Let's give him what he wants."
[00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:13.580]   The only thing to do, the only sanity,
[00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:16.460]   is to practice having a practice of surrender
[00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:19.060]   and letting go and saying, "Look, if that happens,
[00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:21.860]   (exhales)
[00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:23.180]   "I will face that then."
[00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:24.260]   It's not a verbal thing.
[00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:25.260]   It's in your body.
[00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:28.820]   It's a physiologically softening and letting go.
[00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:30.180]   - An interesting takeaway for me is
[00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:32.060]   confidence doesn't have to be optimism.
[00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:34.900]   It sounds like confidence can be acceptance
[00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:36.460]   that it might not be the optimal.
[00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:37.980]   I think in my mind, it was always,
[00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:39.560]   "I think this is gonna go well
[00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:40.940]   "so I can be confident going into it."
[00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:42.260]   But you can also be confident going into it
[00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:43.420]   and say, "It might not go well.
[00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:45.020]   "I'm just confident that whatever happens,
[00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:45.860]   "I can deal with."
[00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:47.140]   - The underpinning of confidence.
[00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:48.440]   The other one's not bad.
[00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:49.860]   The other one, you could think of it as optimism
[00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:51.380]   or positive anticipation.
[00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:53.780]   And that will tilt the scales in your favor.
[00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:55.880]   If you go into a social interaction being like,
[00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:56.720]   "People are gonna like me.
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:57.540]   "This is gonna be great.
[00:29:57.540 --> 00:29:58.380]   "We're gonna have fun."
[00:29:58.380 --> 00:29:59.680]   You tilt it in your favor versus going in and be like,
[00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:00.520]   "This is gonna suck.
[00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:01.900]   "I don't even like people already."
[00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:03.660]   Right, of course, that's gonna tilt it the other way.
[00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:05.260]   Now you can go and be like, "Oh, this is gonna be fun."
[00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:06.940]   Let's say you're meeting a friend of a friend
[00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:08.380]   at this party and, "Oh, we're gonna connect.
[00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:10.140]   "I've been wanting to meet this person for so long."
[00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:12.100]   You can get there and the person's standoffish.
[00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:12.980]   You don't have control.
[00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:15.180]   So we have to say, "Look, it's probably gonna go well.
[00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:16.280]   "I am capable.
[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:17.540]   "I can talk to anybody."
[00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:18.980]   That's the identity piece
[00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:21.280]   that sets you up for positive anticipation.
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:23.180]   But then you remove the background fear.
[00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:24.500]   "But what if it doesn't?"
[00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:25.800]   "Well, I'll be okay."
[00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:28.080]   And that is the sentence that I think captures
[00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:29.980]   the most unconditional confidence is,
[00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:32.180]   "Either way, I'll be okay."
[00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:33.100]   - So quick recap.
[00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:34.580]   There's these two big habits.
[00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:37.540]   One of them is you wanna be on your own side
[00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:40.080]   and you just gotta stand up to the self-critic.
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:43.440]   And the other is that you need to put yourself out there
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:44.480]   and take some bold actions.
[00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:47.540]   Any other kind of bold discomfort practice
[00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:49.340]   that people can do, exercises?
[00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:52.020]   - Yeah, my favorite one is a visceral.
[00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:54.180]   It's not with the mind at all and it's a cold plunge.
[00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:55.820]   If you don't have a cold plunge, you can do a cold shower.
[00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:56.820]   Maybe that's come up on your show.
[00:30:56.820 --> 00:30:58.240]   I don't know if it's a big hack,
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:00.340]   but from a psychological perspective,
[00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:01.720]   there's physiological benefits too.
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:04.960]   But facing every morning before I go into the cold plunge,
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:08.880]   there is a voice in my head that says, "I don't want to."
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:10.880]   Like every morning, it doesn't matter how long I've done it.
[00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:12.320]   So I get to practice.
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:15.160]   I'm going to override this because it's for my benefit.
[00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:17.320]   I'll even sometimes say to myself, "I don't want to."
[00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:19.020]   And I'm like, "I do want to."
[00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:21.660]   Because when I face what's uncomfortable,
[00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:22.720]   my life is better for it.
[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:24.920]   And of course, the cool thing about the cold plunge
[00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:26.760]   is that you get an immediate payoff.
[00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:27.820]   It's not even when you get out.
[00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:30.220]   For me, the first four seconds of getting in
[00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:33.420]   is submerging my head and then when I'm sitting in it,
[00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:36.020]   it's uncomfortable but intense and fun and weird.
[00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:37.620]   I think I'm in an altered state almost.
[00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:38.980]   The hard part was getting in.
[00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:39.820]   Hard part's getting in.
[00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:40.760]   And that's a great metaphor
[00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:43.420]   'cause that's the same thing for whatever it might be.
[00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:45.580]   The hardest part of the risk is jumping.
[00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:47.380]   It's walking towards those people you don't know
[00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:49.060]   and want to create a business connection with, right?
[00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:50.220]   It's calling the person up.
[00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:51.560]   It's starting the thing.
[00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:52.820]   It's initiating.
[00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:54.980]   'Cause then once you're in it, you're in the moment, right?
[00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:56.260]   You're talking to the person.
[00:31:56.260 --> 00:31:57.520]   Now it's off to the races.
[00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:59.980]   So I think that's a really powerful practice
[00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:01.460]   is the cold plunge.
[00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:03.160]   On the physical side, I like to do those as well
[00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:04.820]   'cause I think they transmit a message
[00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:07.460]   that's not just us talking to ourselves.
[00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:08.760]   Another physical thing for anyone
[00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:10.680]   could be some sort of athletic pursuit
[00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:13.980]   where you have a practice of doing something consistently
[00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:16.560]   that's uncomfortable even though you don't want to sometimes
[00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:17.880]   whatever it is for you.
[00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:19.180]   But I think that and the cold plunge
[00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:21.520]   are really foundational things
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:22.560]   that you might not think be related
[00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:24.160]   to your confidence at all,
[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:26.360]   but they're very much related to the psychology
[00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:28.480]   of being able to go into discomfort
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:30.520]   because going into discomfort equals freedom.
[00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:32.780]   Oh man, talk about rejection practice and other things.
[00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:34.220]   Those are on the social side.
[00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:35.860]   Those are truly liberating as well.
[00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:38.160]   - Just talk a little bit about that exercise.
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:40.960]   - Okay, this is for fear of rejection.
[00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:41.780]   A lot of people might say,
[00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:42.880]   "I don't have a fear of rejection."
[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:46.280]   Okay, try these exercises and see if that's true or not.
[00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:47.320]   Here's a great one.
[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:49.620]   Basically, you walk up to someone and ask a question
[00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:52.220]   that you are 100% certain you're gonna get a no for.
[00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:54.620]   One of the simplest ones for that is can I have $100?
[00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:56.380]   Or whatever the currency of your choice is,
[00:32:56.380 --> 00:32:58.380]   that's equivalent to a large amount of money.
[00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:00.220]   Do it in a friendly, warm way.
[00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:01.160]   That's where it makes it fun.
[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:03.100]   It's like you're asking them, "What time is it?"
[00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:04.260]   Or, "Do you know a restaurant?"
[00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:06.900]   But you're saying, "Hey, can I have $100?"
[00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:09.220]   And it confuses people 'cause you're not begging.
[00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:10.500]   You're not like, "Yeah, poor me."
[00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:11.900]   You're just like, "Hey, I have $100."
[00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:14.180]   You get all kinds of fun reactions,
[00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:15.780]   but you'd be surprised.
[00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:18.540]   Your heart might be pounding before you go do it.
[00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:19.820]   Why is your heart pounding?
[00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:21.020]   'Cause you're in fight or flight.
[00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:21.940]   Why?
[00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:23.900]   Because it could be the rejection.
[00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:27.540]   It could also be that you're breaking social norm.
[00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:28.700]   You're disturbing.
[00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:30.540]   This is a whole topic we can dive into,
[00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:32.020]   what I would call the cultural field.
[00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:35.340]   There's an invisible field, just like gravity is invisible.
[00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:38.340]   The cultural field is affecting you right now.
[00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:39.900]   Even in this interview, it's affecting us.
[00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:42.120]   How I talk, how I use my face.
[00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:44.300]   You know, why I'm not, for those who are watching,
[00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:45.300]   why am I not going like this?
[00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:46.140]   Like, "Me!"
[00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:48.020]   I just did it.
[00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:49.660]   But it's cultural.
[00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:51.280]   If you were to do that in a work meeting,
[00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:53.700]   people would be like, "Does he have a condition?
[00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:54.700]   "Is this okay?"
[00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:56.300]   It's unusual.
[00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:59.460]   But social freedom, which is part of confidence,
[00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:02.020]   as long as you're not hurting somebody or being aggressive,
[00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:04.140]   but just to be free to wear what you want,
[00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:06.020]   say what you want, laugh out loud,
[00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:08.100]   ask whatever you want of anybody,
[00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:10.580]   that requires this kind of bold action of getting rejected.
[00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:12.220]   Asking for $100 is a great one.
[00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:13.980]   And I have some fun stories of at my events,
[00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:16.580]   people will go out and ask for all kinds of things.
[00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:18.780]   Shockingly, they actually end up getting yeses
[00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:20.060]   more than you'd think,
[00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:22.780]   for stuff that would almost certainly seem to be a no.
[00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:24.300]   - You gotta give a couple examples there.
[00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:26.020]   - Okay, this one, you can see.
[00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:27.620]   Someone walks up to someone at a restaurant,
[00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:28.820]   they have chips and guacamole,
[00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:29.660]   "Can I have one of your chips
[00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:30.860]   "and dip it in your guacamole?"
[00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:32.340]   They say, "Okay."
[00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:33.740]   Yeah, you might say, "That's not crazy."
[00:34:33.740 --> 00:34:35.580]   Here's another one that I was really surprised by.
[00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:36.780]   A man walks up to a woman
[00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:38.660]   who's outside at a Mexican restaurant,
[00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:39.820]   and she's eating a burrito.
[00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:41.180]   And he says, "Excuse me."
[00:34:41.180 --> 00:34:42.020]   She says, "What?"
[00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:43.880]   "No preamble, excuse me."
[00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:44.860]   "Yes?"
[00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:46.380]   "Can I have a bite of your burrito?"
[00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:48.220]   And she's like, "Okay,"
[00:34:48.220 --> 00:34:50.060]   and gives him a bite of her burrito.
[00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:51.080]   Another one, someone says,
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:52.780]   "Hey, can I take your bicycle?"
[00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:53.840]   The guy's on a bike.
[00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:56.460]   "Can I take your bike for a spin around the block?"
[00:34:56.460 --> 00:34:57.440]   Guy says, "Yes."
[00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:58.780]   This is my favorite one.
[00:34:58.780 --> 00:35:00.740]   A woman goes up to someone who's got a dog,
[00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:04.260]   and she says, "Hey, can I take your dog for a walk?"
[00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:05.620]   "No preamble."
[00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:07.780]   And the woman's like, "Okay."
[00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:09.900]   And then this person who's participating at the event,
[00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:11.240]   their goal is to rack up rejection.
[00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:12.860]   She doesn't wanna sit there and walk someone's dog,
[00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:15.740]   so she's like, "Actually, I don't want to."
[00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:16.940]   She walks away.
[00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:19.340]   The person's like, "What?"
[00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:21.120]   So, there you go, social freedom.
[00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:22.640]   - Let's talk for a second about social freedom.
[00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:24.460]   Until I was reading up on your work,
[00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:25.820]   it's not even something I'd heard of.
[00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:26.660]   What does it mean,
[00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:28.940]   and what can it do for your life by having more of it?
[00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:29.780]   - As far as I know,
[00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:30.900]   I haven't heard that term anywhere else.
[00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:32.260]   I just came up with it 'cause I was thinking,
[00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:34.820]   what's the opposite of social anxiety, right?
[00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:36.340]   I was like, "It's social confidence,"
[00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:38.020]   but actually, it's like social freedom.
[00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:42.460]   The idea is you're free to be 100% you
[00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:44.220]   and do what you want in the world
[00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:47.580]   and not be restricted by the cultural field.
[00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:49.260]   Obviously, you have constraints.
[00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:50.140]   There's laws.
[00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:51.180]   There's things that don't feel good
[00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:52.580]   to your own personal ethics.
[00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:56.660]   But most people are in a cage that's much tighter than that.
[00:35:56.660 --> 00:35:57.780]   It's not the laws.
[00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:00.620]   It's my mom told me I was bothering people when I was young,
[00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:01.700]   so I don't wanna bother people.
[00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:03.440]   Oh, I learned when I was in junior high
[00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:06.220]   that if I look too interested, then I'm desperate.
[00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:07.500]   Okay, I'm gonna look cool, right?
[00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:10.780]   We have hundreds of little conclusions
[00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:13.260]   and if-then statements of how we should be
[00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:17.380]   in order to be good, lovable,
[00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:19.860]   worthwhile, attractive, all these things.
[00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:21.940]   We're operating in this cage
[00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:24.020]   that ultimately, though, it's not really you.
[00:36:24.020 --> 00:36:27.140]   The kicker is you're actually more attractive,
[00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:30.100]   more lovable when you step outside of that cage
[00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:32.660]   and you let your natural, enthusiastic,
[00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:34.100]   funny, quirky, weird self,
[00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:35.820]   all the things that you were connected to
[00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:38.620]   when you were 10 years old, you bring them back in.
[00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:39.460]   And that's something that we actually
[00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:40.620]   have to consciously do.
[00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:43.260]   I've seen people who are powerhouses in business.
[00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:45.500]   They're so confident and they seem like
[00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:46.340]   they have no issues with this
[00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:48.180]   and to go walk down a street
[00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:50.960]   and say hi to 15 or 20 strangers,
[00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:52.340]   it makes them nervous because,
[00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:55.700]   oh, I'm confident in this role as a business person,
[00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:57.500]   but the social freedom of I get to be
[00:36:57.500 --> 00:36:59.900]   whoever I want around people scares them.
[00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:01.660]   That's just another place that we wanna practice
[00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:03.180]   those two things, right?
[00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:04.320]   Changing the way you talk to yourself,
[00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:06.820]   being on your own side and doing the bold things
[00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:08.220]   that make you uncomfortable
[00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:09.920]   so you can free yourself socially.
[00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:13.260]   - I feel like I might be late to the game with this,
[00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:14.460]   but I'll share it anyways.
[00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:16.340]   So earlier this year, I got sick
[00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:18.380]   and felt incredibly dehydrated.
[00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:19.780]   Instead of just drinking water,
[00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:21.580]   I decided to try Element,
[00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:23.980]   which is an electrolyte drink mix that tastes great
[00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:26.460]   and has everything you need and nothing you don't.
[00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:28.780]   That means a lot of salt with no sugar.
[00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:31.220]   It was so amazing that not only do we keep it
[00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:32.980]   in the kitchen all the time now,
[00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:35.020]   but I also reached out to them to work together.
[00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:37.100]   And now I am so excited they're a sponsor
[00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:38.420]   for today's episode.
[00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:40.580]   Honestly, I can't believe I never realized
[00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:42.800]   the importance of replenishing electrolytes,
[00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:45.300]   whether it's after a few cocktails, working out,
[00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:48.020]   or you just wanna keep up with an active lifestyle.
[00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:50.180]   And it makes sense because some common symptoms
[00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:52.580]   of electrolyte deficiency include headaches,
[00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:55.340]   muscle cramps, fatigue, and sleeplessness.
[00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:57.940]   So when it came to how to get those electrolytes,
[00:37:57.940 --> 00:38:00.780]   Element was an easy choice because there's no sugar,
[00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:03.180]   no coloring, no artificial ingredients.
[00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:05.780]   And on top of that, it tastes so good.
[00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:07.460]   My favorite is Lemon Habanero,
[00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:09.420]   but you don't have to take my word for it.
[00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:11.060]   You can try it out risk-free
[00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:14.340]   because Element has a no questions asked refund policy.
[00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:17.180]   And right now, Element is offering a free sample pack
[00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:18.420]   with any purchase.
[00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:20.420]   That's eight single serving packs free
[00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:21.900]   with any Element order.
[00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:24.080]   This is a great way to try all eight flavors
[00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:26.380]   or share Element with a salty friend.
[00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:30.540]   Get yours at allthehacks.com/lmnt.
[00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:32.540]   This deal is only available through my link.
[00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:36.940]   You must go to allthehacks.com/element, L-M-N-T.
[00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:41.700]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions
[00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:44.220]   about life, money, and so much more,
[00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:46.780]   but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people
[00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:48.220]   in your situation,
[00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:50.820]   which actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:54.100]   So I wanna introduce you to today's sponsor, Long Angle.
[00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:56.960]   Long Angle is a community of high net worth individuals
[00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:59.100]   with backgrounds in everything from technology,
[00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:01.220]   finance, medicine, to real estate,
[00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:03.620]   law, manufacturing, and more.
[00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:05.020]   I'm a member of Long Angle.
[00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:07.020]   I've loved being a part of the community,
[00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:09.300]   and I've even had one of the founders, Tad Fallows,
[00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:11.460]   join me on All the Hacks in episode 87
[00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:13.820]   to talk about alternative investments.
[00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:15.540]   Now, the majority of Long Angle members
[00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:17.340]   are first generation wealth,
[00:39:17.340 --> 00:39:19.420]   young, highly successful individuals
[00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:21.540]   who join the community to share knowledge
[00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:22.900]   and learn from each other
[00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:25.500]   in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:27.780]   On top of that, members also get access
[00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:31.100]   to some unique private market investment opportunities.
[00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:32.540]   Like I said, I'm a member,
[00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:34.700]   and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:36.660]   because you're getting advice and feedback
[00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:39.140]   from people in a similar situation to you
[00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:41.580]   on everything from your investment portfolio,
[00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:42.940]   to your children's education,
[00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:45.220]   to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:46.700]   So many of these conversations
[00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:48.900]   aren't happening anywhere else online,
[00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:52.580]   so if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets,
[00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:54.420]   which is their minimum for membership,
[00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:56.580]   I encourage you to check out Long Angle,
[00:39:56.580 --> 00:39:58.660]   and it's totally free to join.
[00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:01.820]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more,
[00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:03.340]   and if you choose to apply,
[00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:06.260]   be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:10.360]   Again, that's longangle, A-N-G-L-E, .com.
[00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:11.760]   (air whooshing)
[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:13.080]   I just wanna thank you, Quik,
[00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:15.400]   for listening to and supporting the show.
[00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:18.240]   Your support is what keeps this show going.
[00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:20.920]   To get all of the URLs, codes, deals,
[00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:22.700]   and discounts from our partners,
[00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:26.240]   you can go to allthehacks.com/deals,

[00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:31.280]   Social freedom, we've got confidence.
[00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:34.560]   Are there other byproducts or ways to use these two habits
[00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:36.560]   to increase our happiness,
[00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:38.660]   our satisfaction in life, or anything?
[00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:40.640]   I don't know if you can officially claim this one
[00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:41.480]   on internet marketing,
[00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:42.980]   but I have an internal phrase that I say,
[00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:45.080]   which is double your confidence, double your income.
[00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:47.480]   I truly believe, and I've seen this in people,
[00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:49.320]   that as you grow in your confidence,
[00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:51.740]   if you're willing to take bold action,
[00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:54.280]   which it's not just saying hi to a stranger
[00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:55.440]   or getting a date or something,
[00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:58.240]   a bold action is to ask for something,
[00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:01.320]   to ask directly, to ask unapologetically.
[00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:04.040]   There are hundreds of examples of if you're willing to ask,
[00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:05.840]   life can give you what you want.
[00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:08.100]   I've seen people who ask for promotions,
[00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:09.440]   who renegotiate salaries,
[00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:12.440]   who've been at companies for years and have never done that.
[00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:14.200]   And they're waiting for the employer to be like,
[00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:15.520]   "Oh, here you go."
[00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:17.000]   And maybe that happens,
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.240]   but often you gotta kinda advocate for it.
[00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:21.720]   All of a sudden, they do it and they're expecting,
[00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:24.920]   "How dare you, you ingrateful, horrible person,
[00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:26.160]   "you're fired," or whatever.
[00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:27.720]   The negotiator's like, sometimes like,
[00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:29.680]   "Yes, okay, here you go."
[00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:32.140]   Other times it's, "Not now."
[00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:33.600]   And then I coach them instead of being like,
[00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:35.080]   "Okay, fine, sorry."
[00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:36.760]   They're like, "Okay, can you tell me more
[00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:39.300]   "about when that might be, or what I do
[00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:42.380]   "that might warrant that kind of promotion or pay increase?"
[00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:45.460]   Being in that direct contact with their employer,
[00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:46.500]   with coworkers.
[00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:50.340]   Running a business is all about asking people
[00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:52.140]   to promote you, to work with you,
[00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:54.140]   to buy your products or services.
[00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:55.780]   And I can't tell you how many people
[00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:57.620]   are not as successful in their own businesses
[00:41:57.620 --> 00:42:00.180]   because they're afraid to boldly ask people
[00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:03.380]   to buy their stuff through the form of marketing.
[00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:04.220]   For me, it would be like,
[00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:05.900]   "I'm gonna put a lot of free teachings out there."
[00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:07.800]   And then maybe if you wanna buy something,
[00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:08.960]   you'll just do it, I guess.
[00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:10.520]   And I learned I had to actually be able to say,
[00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:11.700]   "Hey, if you're enjoying this
[00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:12.940]   "and you're benefiting from this,
[00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:14.440]   "go check out this program.
[00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:16.080]   "Here's why you want it."
[00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:17.400]   Being able to ask boldly.
[00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:18.840]   So if you do those things,
[00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:20.680]   plus you keep expanding your identity
[00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:23.080]   to see yourself as successful and capable,
[00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:25.360]   I've seen people change jobs, start businesses,
[00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:28.520]   grow businesses, and definitely increase their income
[00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:31.200]   from just these two habits as well.
[00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:33.180]   - I got an email the other day that said,
[00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:34.600]   "Hi, I work for this company
[00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:37.160]   "and we have a client who wants to understand more
[00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:39.960]   "about the automated investment advisory space.
[00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:41.560]   "Would you be up to do a one-hour call?"
[00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:43.080]   I do a two-minute call with this guy.
[00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:45.840]   He's like, "Yeah, right now the rate is $300 an hour."
[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:47.520]   I was thinking $1,000 an hour.
[00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:49.400]   It's one hour, it's not a long-term commitment.
[00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:51.400]   It felt like an opportunity to just see what happens.
[00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:53.000]   And he's like, "I think we could do that."
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:55.120]   And I was like, (laughs)
[00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:58.360]   that was more than three X for just a response.
[00:42:58.360 --> 00:42:59.720]   - Double your confidence, triple your income.
[00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:01.440]   Doesn't have the same alliterative flow,
[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:03.820]   but you know, look at that, double your income or more.
[00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:05.620]   And that's the crazy thing, right?
[00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:07.380]   You are bold enough to ask,
[00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:09.760]   and you could have gotten a no or a negotiation or whatever,
[00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:12.540]   but so many people, myself included,
[00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:15.620]   we just won't ask, why?
[00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:17.740]   Because it's uncomfortable and it's unconscious.
[00:43:17.740 --> 00:43:19.260]   Oh, I don't know, I don't know.
[00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:21.100]   But that moment right there is no different
[00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:22.460]   than getting into the cold plunge, right?
[00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:23.300]   That's exciting.
[00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:25.820]   And then once that happens though, what kind of cascade?
[00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:27.340]   - That's my new rate, by the way.
[00:43:27.340 --> 00:43:28.980]   - Exactly, right?
[00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:31.800]   It sets up a cascade where you're like,
[00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:32.840]   hey, this is what I do.
[00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:35.640]   People pay me $1,000 per hour, which is true.
[00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:37.280]   Now, you could even say that, right?
[00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:38.840]   And this person's like, "Well, how much do you charge?"
[00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:40.080]   We were thinking 300.
[00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:42.040]   Well, people typically pay me 1,000,
[00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:43.120]   so that's what I'd be willing to do.
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:44.820]   If you want to do some sort of longer term thing,
[00:43:44.820 --> 00:43:46.560]   we might be able to negotiate something different,
[00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:47.920]   but for a one-off, it's 1,000.
[00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:49.500]   That's your identity has expanded.
[00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:50.880]   That's just normal for you now.
[00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:52.120]   - I think that one was hard for me,
[00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:54.120]   and it took some practice over some time.
[00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:56.560]   So we've talked a bunch about the inner critic and the fear.
[00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:59.380]   One of the places I face that the most
[00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:02.220]   is when I'm trying to make some decision,
[00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:05.360]   usually in an area I'm actually more confident in,
[00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:07.860]   so it's saving money or it's booking travel.
[00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:10.020]   I have this fear that I could be making
[00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:11.580]   a more optimal decision.
[00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:14.540]   It could be as silly as I'm buying groceries online
[00:44:14.540 --> 00:44:16.420]   and I'm trying to make sure that I get the best deal
[00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:19.500]   of the basket of goods, or I'm trying to pick a hotel
[00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:21.100]   and I want to get the best hotel.
[00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:22.420]   This critic is telling me,
[00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:24.260]   "Maybe if you just do a little bit more research,
[00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:26.360]   you'll come to this optimal answer."
[00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:28.540]   Can I use these habits in that situation,
[00:44:28.540 --> 00:44:30.660]   or is there something about that fear
[00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:33.660]   that I need to recognize that I won't make the best choice?
[00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:34.500]   - Well, I think that would be
[00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:35.780]   the interesting question to look at.
[00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:37.380]   Maybe that's true.
[00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:40.600]   Maybe you could find a hotel that is cheaper
[00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:43.020]   or has better bang for your buck
[00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:44.880]   based upon whatever things you're looking for.
[00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:46.520]   Let's just say that that's true.
[00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:48.720]   There's a part of you that's like, "No!"
[00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:51.460]   I guess we want to investigate that.
[00:44:51.460 --> 00:44:53.580]   Why is that so unacceptable?
[00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:55.860]   That's the part that we would want to go into.
[00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:58.700]   My sense is if we don't get the best thing,
[00:44:58.700 --> 00:45:00.400]   something bad is happening.
[00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:01.780]   Is that what it is for you?
[00:45:01.780 --> 00:45:05.960]   - Maybe it's I could have gotten a better deal/experience,
[00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:08.540]   but I think I've heard you even say something
[00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:11.700]   along the lines of even the optimal outcome
[00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:14.840]   still has some negative possibility.
[00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:17.480]   There is no optimal outcome, I guess, is the real answer.
[00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:20.240]   - Well, you're choosing a circumstance,
[00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:22.120]   and every circumstance in our life,
[00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:24.860]   every hotel, every trip, every date,
[00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:29.420]   every day of your life is going to have a mixture
[00:45:29.420 --> 00:45:32.200]   of good and bad, pleasure, discomfort, pain.
[00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:34.820]   There is 100% no day that's avoidable of that.
[00:45:34.820 --> 00:45:36.500]   And if you have the greatest day of your life,
[00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:38.860]   it's all orchestrated and all the activities are fun,
[00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:40.780]   you'll have challenge with your emotional state.
[00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:42.340]   You'll be like bummed out or anxious
[00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:43.820]   for whatever reason, you don't know why.
[00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:45.380]   So we cannot control it all.
[00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:47.180]   I think that's helpful 'cause the allure
[00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:50.860]   of the maximizing pattern is if I could just nail
[00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:53.700]   the right combo of external factors out there,
[00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:56.380]   I'm gonna get the perfect day, the perfect trip,
[00:45:56.380 --> 00:45:57.420]   the perfect experience.
[00:45:57.420 --> 00:46:00.940]   That unconsciously is thinking perfect means
[00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:03.140]   all pleasure, no pain, all good times,
[00:46:03.140 --> 00:46:04.500]   no frustrating moments.
[00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:05.960]   And when you say, you know what?
[00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:07.460]   This amazing hotel is gonna have
[00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:08.460]   some great things about it.
[00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:11.460]   There's gonna be something at this hotel that I don't like,
[00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:14.140]   even if it's the best price, best deal, best everything.
[00:46:14.140 --> 00:46:16.740]   And this one also over here is gonna have
[00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:18.580]   some great things and some things that I don't like.
[00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:19.980]   So I would put a cap on it.
[00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:21.540]   I'm gonna do 10 minutes of research
[00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:23.860]   to make sure I'm not going to some total dump.
[00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:25.620]   But then look, these things,
[00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:27.300]   they're basically gonna give me the same.
[00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:29.060]   Every path is gonna be a mixture.
[00:46:29.060 --> 00:46:31.200]   When you see that, when you really get that,
[00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:32.660]   all of a sudden the back and forth
[00:46:32.660 --> 00:46:35.540]   doesn't have the same urgency because ultimately,
[00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:37.740]   it's all gonna be a basket of pleasure and pain.
[00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:39.140]   You might say, but if I pick the right one,
[00:46:39.140 --> 00:46:42.560]   it'll have a higher percentage of pleasure over pain.
[00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:46.900]   Yes, maybe, but you generally don't have the data
[00:46:46.900 --> 00:46:47.740]   to know that.
[00:46:47.740 --> 00:46:49.740]   - I almost think it's trying to avoid the pain
[00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:51.420]   of making the wrong choice
[00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:54.460]   than have the joy of making the right choice.
[00:46:54.460 --> 00:46:55.460]   - Interesting.
[00:46:55.460 --> 00:46:57.540]   And how do you know it's the wrong choice?
[00:46:57.540 --> 00:46:59.340]   - That's probably why it takes so long to make a decision
[00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:01.340]   'cause there's no criteria to know that.
[00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:02.660]   - I think the wrong choice would be
[00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:04.180]   you're in that future moment
[00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:06.380]   and something happens that's unpleasant.
[00:47:06.380 --> 00:47:08.540]   And you say, ah, you see, I made the wrong choice.
[00:47:08.540 --> 00:47:11.780]   It's this fantasy world where if I chose the other one,
[00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:13.780]   I would have nothing unpleasant happen.
[00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:15.380]   But then no matter where you go,
[00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:17.540]   you have unpleasant stuff happen.
[00:47:17.540 --> 00:47:21.020]   And then it's like, I need to decide harder next time.
[00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:23.780]   And so, when you really embrace that mixture of stuff,
[00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:26.060]   it's so relaxing, it's so relieving
[00:47:26.060 --> 00:47:29.060]   'cause we're trying to avoid these inevitables of life.
[00:47:29.060 --> 00:47:31.260]   All it takes, I think, is just to observe that pattern
[00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:32.140]   from start to finish.
[00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:33.660]   I'm maximizing on the hotel thing.
[00:47:33.660 --> 00:47:34.540]   Let me just pick one.
[00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:35.940]   This is where bold action comes in.
[00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:37.260]   For the maximizing habit,
[00:47:37.260 --> 00:47:39.820]   the bold action is to set a cap
[00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:41.940]   and decide within the reasonable amount of time.
[00:47:41.940 --> 00:47:43.940]   A trip or something like that, pretty quick.
[00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:45.980]   It could be deciding on where we wanna go
[00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:47.500]   from just one conversation.
[00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:48.340]   One feeling.
[00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:49.700]   And then picking the accommodations,
[00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:52.260]   maybe you set aside an hour and just bang 'em all out.
[00:47:52.260 --> 00:47:53.100]   Here's the funny thing.
[00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:54.700]   Let's say you get someplace that really sucks.
[00:47:54.700 --> 00:47:55.940]   I was down in San Diego.
[00:47:55.940 --> 00:47:58.100]   My wife was getting some medical thing done down there.
[00:47:58.100 --> 00:47:59.500]   And we were there for, we was like,
[00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:01.300]   oh, we'll spend a week down there at the same time.
[00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:02.540]   We get this Airbnb.
[00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:03.660]   I pick the Airbnb.
[00:48:03.660 --> 00:48:07.380]   I do no maximizing, which is a problem.
[00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:10.540]   So we go there and they had it listed as a beach view.
[00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:13.260]   There was no beach view, so that was a misrepresentation.
[00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:16.060]   But we get there and the place is just real tiny
[00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:17.860]   and cramped and dirty and some things
[00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:18.980]   that I could not have predicted.
[00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:20.100]   It got real, real fast.
[00:48:20.100 --> 00:48:21.460]   My first time on Airbnb experience
[00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:23.620]   where we messaged the person who was hosting
[00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:25.980]   and she got real aggressive and crazy
[00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:27.580]   and just started saying these threatening things.
[00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:29.420]   I had to get Airbnb support involved.
[00:48:29.420 --> 00:48:31.860]   And there's this illusion that Airbnb is this company
[00:48:31.860 --> 00:48:32.980]   that's gonna take care of you.
[00:48:32.980 --> 00:48:34.660]   It's just like some support dude in India
[00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:36.340]   who's like, let's see what I can do.
[00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:38.220]   Anyway, we ended up having to leave dramatically.
[00:48:38.220 --> 00:48:40.940]   We had to get out within 15 minutes to not be charged.
[00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:41.860]   So we're hustling out of there.
[00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:44.620]   She's sending these threatening texts and then we leave.
[00:48:44.620 --> 00:48:47.460]   And you might say, wow, what a terrible experience.
[00:48:47.460 --> 00:48:49.820]   It ended up that we found another place
[00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:51.660]   that the guy was amazing.
[00:48:51.660 --> 00:48:54.140]   The spot was way better and it was cheaper.
[00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:55.700]   And so I think that's a really helpful thing
[00:48:55.700 --> 00:48:56.860]   to remember as well.
[00:48:56.860 --> 00:48:58.180]   What if this happens?
[00:48:58.180 --> 00:48:59.540]   Well, what if that does happen?
[00:48:59.540 --> 00:49:01.740]   And then it leads to something extraordinary
[00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:03.340]   and you wouldn't get the extraordinary
[00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:04.780]   if that challenge didn't happen.
[00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:06.380]   - It's funny 'cause my example of this
[00:49:06.380 --> 00:49:09.780]   is the exact same example, which is when we went to London,
[00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:12.340]   we had this horrible Airbnb and the host,
[00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:14.540]   we had problems and we surfaced the problems
[00:49:14.540 --> 00:49:16.020]   and they told us we have to leave.
[00:49:16.020 --> 00:49:18.900]   We got Airbnb support, literally the exact same thing.
[00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:22.380]   Where it deviated was Airbnb support was incredibly helpful
[00:49:22.380 --> 00:49:24.900]   and booked us a place that costs twice as much,
[00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:26.860]   but didn't charge us any extra.
[00:49:26.860 --> 00:49:27.700]   - Ooh.
[00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:31.140]   - We ended up staying at this ridiculously amazing place
[00:49:31.140 --> 00:49:35.020]   that I still think about because they had this kid's room.
[00:49:35.020 --> 00:49:37.620]   There was a Harry Potter themed room with a train bed
[00:49:37.620 --> 00:49:39.980]   and a little tree reading nook.
[00:49:39.980 --> 00:49:42.780]   They turned the radiator into a castle and it was crazy.
[00:49:42.780 --> 00:49:43.980]   - Wow. - But it was really awesome.
[00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:46.460]   - And that experience wouldn't have happened
[00:49:46.460 --> 00:49:49.940]   had we not picked the crappy Airbnb.
[00:49:49.940 --> 00:49:51.940]   - What if you really internalize that?
[00:49:51.940 --> 00:49:52.860]   It's like talking to yourself.
[00:49:52.860 --> 00:49:56.300]   Hey, the unexpected, the problems
[00:49:56.300 --> 00:49:58.940]   can actually lead to extraordinary.
[00:49:58.940 --> 00:50:00.780]   Now we're talking about something that
[00:50:00.780 --> 00:50:01.940]   if we were to go way back to the beginning
[00:50:01.940 --> 00:50:04.540]   of this conversation, how do you define confidence?
[00:50:04.540 --> 00:50:06.020]   So I've been doing this for like 20 years now.
[00:50:06.020 --> 00:50:08.560]   I started my own self-confidence at age 20, I'm 40 now.
[00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:09.960]   There's confidence for yourself.
[00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:11.220]   I can handle whatever happens,
[00:50:11.220 --> 00:50:13.100]   but I discovered that there's a cap on that.
[00:50:13.100 --> 00:50:16.100]   How joyful and awesome our lives can be,
[00:50:16.100 --> 00:50:17.980]   there's a ceiling on self-confidence.
[00:50:17.980 --> 00:50:20.740]   And to go higher into really thriving in life,
[00:50:20.740 --> 00:50:22.020]   I think we need to have confidence
[00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:23.920]   in something beyond ourselves.
[00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:26.420]   Whatever you wanna put in that box, I don't care.
[00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:29.260]   But that's the kind of belief that's tapped into that.
[00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:30.940]   Even out of the challenging experience,
[00:50:30.940 --> 00:50:32.680]   something extraordinary is gonna come.
[00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:34.060]   And that's a beautiful example of that.
[00:50:34.060 --> 00:50:35.780]   And you have that memory for the rest of your life, right?
[00:50:35.780 --> 00:50:38.460]   It's a little reminder so that the next time
[00:50:38.460 --> 00:50:39.420]   you're sitting down to book something
[00:50:39.420 --> 00:50:42.040]   and you're like, "Ugh," just like, "Whoa, I'm maximizing.
[00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:44.580]   "I'm gonna give myself three minutes, pick a thing,
[00:50:44.580 --> 00:50:46.780]   "and who knows, it's gonna lead to extraordinary."
[00:50:46.780 --> 00:50:47.620]   - I love it.
[00:50:47.620 --> 00:50:48.440]   I've been thinking,
[00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:50.060]   ever since we stopped talking about social freedom,
[00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:52.460]   there's something that's been resonating in my mind.
[00:50:52.460 --> 00:50:54.660]   All of these kind of social obligations
[00:50:54.660 --> 00:50:56.220]   that my wife and I always look at each other like,
[00:50:56.220 --> 00:50:57.260]   "Gosh, I don't wanna do that thing."
[00:50:57.260 --> 00:50:58.680]   And she's like, "Yeah, I don't wanna do that thing,
[00:50:58.680 --> 00:51:01.560]   "but because this friend invited us this thing
[00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:03.560]   "or this family member said we have to go,
[00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:06.420]   "we have to do it and we don't wanna do it."
[00:51:06.420 --> 00:51:07.580]   Does that play in there?
[00:51:07.580 --> 00:51:09.980]   Is social freedom truly being able to tell your friend
[00:51:09.980 --> 00:51:11.920]   or your family, "Hey, we don't actually wanna hang out
[00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:12.760]   "with you."
[00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:13.980]   - I know you've written a book called "Not Nice."
[00:51:13.980 --> 00:51:14.820]   - Yes.
[00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:17.420]   - How does this all come together in situations like this
[00:51:17.420 --> 00:51:20.300]   to be able to actually do the things we want with our lives
[00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:23.340]   and be happy, but not make everyone around us
[00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:25.140]   think we're assholes?
[00:51:25.140 --> 00:51:26.620]   - Definitely tell 'em just like that.
[00:51:26.620 --> 00:51:29.420]   I just don't wanna hang out with you, period, full stop.
[00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:34.080]   No, I think there is really tuning in and asking yourself,
[00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:35.680]   what do I, or in the case, maybe you and your wife,
[00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:36.620]   what do we really want?
[00:51:36.620 --> 00:51:37.980]   Or maybe it's what do I want, what do you want?
[00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:39.460]   Let's really get clear on that.
[00:51:39.460 --> 00:51:41.040]   And a lot of people don't even let themselves
[00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:43.380]   discover that, because that's bad to not wanna go
[00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:45.660]   to your uncle's friends reunions thing, right?
[00:51:45.660 --> 00:51:48.020]   How bad of me, what a bad nephew and son I am.
[00:51:48.020 --> 00:51:50.740]   But just in the safety of your own brain
[00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:51.900]   and maybe with your partner, it's like,
[00:51:51.900 --> 00:51:53.760]   "Hey, what do I really want?
[00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:54.820]   "I don't wanna go to that thing."
[00:51:54.820 --> 00:51:55.980]   And just give space to that.
[00:51:55.980 --> 00:51:57.500]   That sounds so simple, but most people don't.
[00:51:57.500 --> 00:51:59.260]   And they're just an override, override.
[00:51:59.260 --> 00:52:01.820]   Sometimes just airing it and hearing that part of you
[00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:02.740]   feels good.
[00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:04.520]   Then you actually have a choice there.
[00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:06.260]   It's like the cold plunge.
[00:52:06.260 --> 00:52:08.100]   "I don't wanna go to the cold plunge,
[00:52:08.100 --> 00:52:10.380]   "but I do because here's why."
[00:52:10.380 --> 00:52:13.380]   And just tune in, is that true in this situation?
[00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:16.620]   So Christmas time, we go visit my wife's side of the family.
[00:52:16.620 --> 00:52:17.980]   I love her side of the family.
[00:52:17.980 --> 00:52:19.860]   When it's travel and this and that,
[00:52:19.860 --> 00:52:21.860]   and driving there and packing everything up
[00:52:21.860 --> 00:52:23.260]   and then staying in their place.
[00:52:23.260 --> 00:52:25.080]   Some part of me is like, "Nah, that's a lot of work.
[00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:26.500]   "I don't wanna, just go without me.
[00:52:26.500 --> 00:52:28.020]   "I'll just stay home, that's fine."
[00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:28.940]   But then I tune in.
[00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:30.620]   Yes, there's a part of me, it's like, "It's easier,
[00:52:30.620 --> 00:52:32.320]   "but what do I really want?
[00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:35.300]   "Oh, I really want to be apart and connected
[00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:37.280]   "with my wife, with family.
[00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:39.760]   "I'm gonna endure some of the discomforts
[00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:42.700]   "because I ultimately value and prioritizing
[00:52:42.700 --> 00:52:46.200]   "or optimizing for connection and deep relationships.
[00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:47.660]   "That doesn't mean I go to everything,
[00:52:47.660 --> 00:52:49.380]   "every function, every person's thing.
[00:52:49.380 --> 00:52:52.740]   "We have to have that choice of what are the relationships
[00:52:52.740 --> 00:52:55.040]   "that I want to really nourish and invest in?"
[00:52:55.040 --> 00:52:57.280]   And it does involve saying no
[00:52:57.280 --> 00:53:00.200]   to a good percentage of things.
[00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:04.340]   And doing so in a warm and loving way.
[00:53:04.340 --> 00:53:06.140]   "Thank you for letting me know.
[00:53:06.140 --> 00:53:07.880]   "I'm not gonna be able to make it to that."
[00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:08.720]   You don't have to give a ton of reasons.
[00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:10.280]   "I've got to take the kids to the dentist."
[00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:11.120]   No, I'm not available.
[00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:12.100]   I'm not gonna be able to make that.
[00:53:12.100 --> 00:53:13.220]   Thank you so much for thinking of me.
[00:53:13.220 --> 00:53:14.060]   I believe you have a great time.
[00:53:14.060 --> 00:53:17.480]   But do know there's a social currency
[00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:19.540]   that if you have a friend who's always inviting you
[00:53:19.540 --> 00:53:21.780]   to things and you always say, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no."
[00:53:21.780 --> 00:53:24.340]   Then when you invite them, they might not be a yes.
[00:53:24.340 --> 00:53:27.260]   There's a certain investment.
[00:53:27.260 --> 00:53:28.100]   But the question is,
[00:53:28.100 --> 00:53:29.480]   where do you want to put that investment?
[00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:31.600]   Some friends you want to invest a lot with.
[00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:34.540]   Some you're like, "Oh, I'll see him once in a while."
[00:53:34.540 --> 00:53:38.680]   And some, honestly, if it's mainly obligation,
[00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:40.160]   "It's time to let it go."
[00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:42.460]   - I think sometimes I've already let it go.
[00:53:42.460 --> 00:53:44.260]   There's people that just keep asking,
[00:53:44.260 --> 00:53:46.320]   "What's the polite way to say,
[00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:47.240]   "I don't want to go to this
[00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:49.760]   "and feel free to not invite me ever again."
[00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:51.280]   I haven't figured out the nice way to do that.
[00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:52.320]   - Well, I think just a simple,
[00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:54.100]   "Thanks for the invite, I'm not available."
[00:53:54.100 --> 00:53:55.680]   If you do that, I mean, first of all,
[00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:58.040]   some point it'll extinguish, I'd imagine.
[00:53:58.040 --> 00:53:59.880]   Continually, no.
[00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:01.640]   At some point, they'll be like, "He's not available."
[00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:03.000]   The next level, that would be kind of like
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:04.200]   just being more direct.
[00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:06.320]   I always tell people life is a choose-your-own-adventure.
[00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:07.420]   You might say, "I can't be that guy.
[00:54:07.420 --> 00:54:08.860]   "That's an asshole thing to do."
[00:54:08.860 --> 00:54:09.700]   Maybe it's not.
[00:54:09.700 --> 00:54:11.560]   - I mean, just go back to what you said about being bold.
[00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:13.920]   There are times where I think it took me a while
[00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:15.160]   to get the courage to tell people
[00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:17.360]   that I don't have time in my life to do a thing.
[00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:19.820]   Especially with work obligations and responding emails.
[00:54:19.820 --> 00:54:21.160]   I was having a conversation,
[00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:22.800]   or maybe I was preparing for a conversation
[00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:24.860]   with Derek Sivers, who had said,
[00:54:24.860 --> 00:54:26.640]   "I like to tell people I don't have time."
[00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:28.300]   And when I got his email at one point where he was like,
[00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:29.860]   "I might not respond to this.
[00:54:29.860 --> 00:54:31.100]   "There's a lot of stuff going on in my life
[00:54:31.100 --> 00:54:32.520]   "and I'm really trying to focus on the things
[00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:33.360]   "that are the most important.
[00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:34.960]   "And right now, spending time with my kids
[00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:35.800]   "is most important."
[00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:37.120]   I was like, "I'm not mad that you told me
[00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:38.320]   "you can't reply to my email.
[00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:40.340]   "I'm actually jealous it had this effect."
[00:54:40.340 --> 00:54:44.000]   Maybe the answer to use the same set of habits here
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:46.020]   is you might think you're being an asshole by saying that,
[00:54:46.020 --> 00:54:47.220]   but maybe you're not.
[00:54:47.220 --> 00:54:50.020]   Maybe it won't actually be interpreted in that way.
[00:54:50.020 --> 00:54:51.300]   - Right, here's the thing.
[00:54:51.300 --> 00:54:52.800]   Yes, it sounds like he communicated
[00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:55.140]   with some vulnerability or transparency.
[00:54:55.140 --> 00:54:55.980]   It wasn't just like, "Fuck off.
[00:54:55.980 --> 00:54:57.220]   "I don't have time for you," right?
[00:54:57.220 --> 00:54:59.060]   It was like, "Hey, this is what's going on for me."
[00:54:59.060 --> 00:55:00.020]   That's a great way to do it.
[00:55:00.020 --> 00:55:02.720]   It's sort of the technique or the communication style.
[00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:03.560]   But here's the thing.
[00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:05.800]   I think this is the biggest part of social freedom.
[00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:07.520]   Are you an asshole or not?
[00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:08.860]   It's in the eye of the beholder.
[00:55:08.860 --> 00:55:11.760]   If you're bad in your mind, that's the biggest problem.
[00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:13.800]   If you're not allowed, it goes against your,
[00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:15.480]   I call this your personal bill of rights.
[00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:16.960]   You might not have a right to say,
[00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:18.760]   "No, I'm not available for that."
[00:55:18.760 --> 00:55:21.640]   You might not have a right to not respond to all the emails.
[00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:23.440]   As long as you don't have that right
[00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:24.980]   'cause you haven't claimed it,
[00:55:24.980 --> 00:55:26.880]   you're gonna feel guilty, you're gonna feel stressed,
[00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:28.080]   you may even feel irritated at them.
[00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:29.240]   "How dare you ask me?"
[00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:30.160]   In my personal bill of rights,
[00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:33.280]   I have a right to not respond to all emails.
[00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:34.300]   Because in this day and age,
[00:55:34.300 --> 00:55:36.440]   if you feel pressure to reply to all your emails,
[00:55:36.440 --> 00:55:38.360]   good God, the more emails you reply to,
[00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:39.600]   the more emails they are.
[00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:40.840]   It's like they multiply.
[00:55:40.840 --> 00:55:44.000]   I'll reply to some of the emails of my clients.
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:45.080]   I'll try to get back to a lot of them,
[00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:46.640]   but not everybody, not all the time.
[00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:50.360]   Someone out there sometimes might think he's an asshole
[00:55:50.360 --> 00:55:52.400]   'cause he didn't do X for me.
[00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:53.840]   And you know what?
[00:55:53.840 --> 00:55:54.800]   That's okay.
[00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:56.680]   If we're operating in life
[00:55:56.680 --> 00:55:59.360]   where no one must ever think that of me,
[00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:01.280]   then you're gonna be in a pretzel position
[00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:02.600]   faster than you can imagine.
[00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:03.840]   It's unsustainable.
[00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:04.660]   It's not you.
[00:56:04.660 --> 00:56:06.320]   So really finding that permission
[00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:09.720]   to not do the things that you truly don't wanna do.
[00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:11.580]   And that's certainly bold action, by the way.
[00:56:11.580 --> 00:56:12.640]   - Let's go back to this bill of rights
[00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:15.920]   because when I talked to Ramit Sethi about money,
[00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:17.480]   he has Ramit's money rules.
[00:56:17.480 --> 00:56:20.280]   They just really simplify his decision-making about things
[00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:22.400]   'cause he just took the uncertainty out of it.
[00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:25.480]   He says, "If someone is raising money for charity,
[00:56:25.480 --> 00:56:26.700]   "I always give money.
[00:56:26.700 --> 00:56:29.640]   "If I fly for more than five hours or whatever the number is,
[00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:30.880]   "I always fly business class."
[00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:32.320]   And it just makes it super simple
[00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:35.240]   'cause he's thought about the decision abstractly
[00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:37.000]   from actually having to make it.
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:38.640]   Like I always buy books.
[00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:39.720]   If I wanna learn something
[00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:41.720]   and a book might have the answer, I always buy it.
[00:56:41.720 --> 00:56:43.880]   I never stress out if it's $10 or $12 or 20,
[00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:44.880]   I just always buy it.
[00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:45.840]   Talk about this bill of rights
[00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:47.720]   'cause it seems like something that I
[00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:50.000]   and maybe everyone listening would benefit from having.
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:51.760]   - Yes, we all have one.
[00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:54.240]   It might be a very short list of rights
[00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:56.000]   or it might be a long list of rights.
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:58.200]   The more socially not free you are,
[00:56:58.200 --> 00:56:59.620]   the more you're in the cage,
[00:56:59.620 --> 00:57:01.240]   the shorter your bill of rights.
[00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:04.400]   A bill of rights is just a statement of permissions.
[00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:06.680]   I'm allowed to, I have a right to.
[00:57:06.680 --> 00:57:08.800]   And you'll know what's in your bill of rights
[00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:11.080]   based on how you feel and what you do.
[00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:13.080]   Do I have a right to say no to that person
[00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:14.880]   requesting I come to their thing?
[00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:17.480]   Did you say yes when you didn't wanna go?
[00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:18.320]   Then you might not have a right
[00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:21.320]   that says I get to say no to people's requests,
[00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:22.480]   to people's invitations.
[00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:26.440]   Or you might say, I have a right to repeatedly say no
[00:57:26.440 --> 00:57:27.800]   to someone's requests.
[00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:28.900]   That's a different thing.
[00:57:28.900 --> 00:57:31.600]   Here's some core ones that I encourage people to adopt
[00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:33.280]   and make sure they have on their bill of rights.
[00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:35.680]   I have a right to ask for what I want.
[00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:38.040]   I have a right to say no.
[00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:41.160]   I have a right to approach anyone,
[00:57:41.160 --> 00:57:43.840]   whether that's virtually or in person.
[00:57:43.840 --> 00:57:45.500]   Doesn't mean they wanna talk to you.
[00:57:45.500 --> 00:57:48.600]   If you stop yourself before you even allow
[00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:51.340]   the opening or the approach,
[00:57:51.340 --> 00:57:53.240]   you're gonna limit your life significantly.
[00:57:53.240 --> 00:57:54.360]   And people have all kinds of stories.
[00:57:54.360 --> 00:57:55.200]   I'm gonna bother them.
[00:57:55.200 --> 00:57:56.480]   Maybe they'll be bothered, maybe they won't.
[00:57:56.480 --> 00:57:57.320]   Let's find out.
[00:57:57.320 --> 00:57:58.680]   You know, in the case of the person
[00:57:58.680 --> 00:57:59.880]   wanting to hire you for your services,
[00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:02.640]   I have a right to ask for whatever fee I want
[00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:04.080]   for my services, whatever feels right.
[00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:05.080]   Actually, it's an exercise.
[00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:06.320]   It's very much worth doing.
[00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:07.440]   And I do it with clients.
[00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:09.920]   Like have them sit down and like, well, write it out.
[00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:11.160]   It doesn't have to be perfect.
[00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:13.440]   What would feel empowering to you?
[00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:15.040]   As you write it, you're nodding your head,
[00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:17.000]   like, yeah, all right.
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:19.340]   Just come up with a list of five, 10,
[00:58:19.340 --> 00:58:22.240]   like a nation that has a bill of rights for its people.
[00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:24.000]   This is your bill of rights for you.
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:25.760]   Those must first be written
[00:58:25.760 --> 00:58:27.280]   and then they have to be practiced.
[00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:30.280]   Otherwise, they're just flowery language on paper
[00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:31.200]   if you're not actually doing them.
[00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:32.640]   - Are there a few more examples you can give
[00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:34.920]   to inspire people as they're hopefully thinking
[00:58:34.920 --> 00:58:36.160]   about what would be on theirs?
[00:58:36.160 --> 00:58:37.720]   - Yeah, I mean, I think one thing to break it down
[00:58:37.720 --> 00:58:39.320]   is just think of the different areas of your life.
[00:58:39.320 --> 00:58:42.800]   Think about in your relationship, your romantic relationship.
[00:58:42.800 --> 00:58:46.640]   I have a right to tell my partner
[00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:47.800]   when something's bothering me.
[00:58:47.800 --> 00:58:50.960]   That might sound real simple, but a lot of people shy away.
[00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:51.920]   I don't wanna upset them.
[00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:53.080]   I don't wanna bother them.
[00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:54.600]   This one I had to add to my bill of rights.
[00:58:54.600 --> 00:58:55.840]   It's a doozy.
[00:58:55.840 --> 00:58:57.940]   I have a right to disappoint people.
[00:58:57.940 --> 00:59:00.000]   Particularly, I have a right to disappoint my partner.
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:01.960]   I would be running around in my whole life
[00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:03.440]   trying not to disappoint anybody.
[00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:05.560]   I don't wanna have anyone be let down.
[00:59:05.560 --> 00:59:08.080]   Look, it's great to be connected with your spouse
[00:59:08.080 --> 00:59:10.760]   and not constantly not give a crap
[00:59:10.760 --> 00:59:12.560]   and disappoint them all over the place, sure.
[00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:16.060]   But no matter how loving you're trying to be,
[00:59:16.060 --> 00:59:18.000]   how generous you're trying to be,
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:20.960]   if you're being authentic and true to what you really want,
[00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:23.000]   sometimes you're gonna disappoint 'em.
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:24.720]   They want you to go to that thing and you don't wanna go.
[00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:26.760]   They wanna have time to connect with you,
[00:59:26.760 --> 00:59:29.120]   but you are unavailable for whatever reason.
[00:59:29.120 --> 00:59:32.640]   Being able to say no
[00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:36.060]   and then withstand that discomfort
[00:59:36.060 --> 00:59:37.720]   of someone is disappointed in me.
[00:59:37.720 --> 00:59:39.280]   The reason I created that bill of right for myself
[00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:40.320]   is 'cause I lived with this kind of
[00:59:40.320 --> 00:59:43.160]   chronic background anxiety that someone somewhere
[00:59:43.160 --> 00:59:44.320]   was gonna be disappointed with me.
[00:59:44.320 --> 00:59:46.500]   And so yeah, sometimes people are disappointed with me
[00:59:46.500 --> 00:59:47.420]   and I have a right to do that.
[00:59:47.420 --> 00:59:49.580]   And really resting on that, that's what it feels like.
[00:59:49.580 --> 00:59:51.780]   It feels like you can rest on your bill of rights
[00:59:51.780 --> 00:59:52.820]   and like all is well.
[00:59:52.820 --> 00:59:54.060]   Like I'm allowed to do that.
[00:59:54.060 --> 00:59:55.720]   And it's almost like teaching a child,
[00:59:55.720 --> 00:59:57.020]   like hey, you're allowed to do this,
[00:59:57.020 --> 00:59:58.860]   but we kinda have to do that for our own selves now.
[00:59:58.860 --> 01:00:00.500]   So you can look at that relationship life,
[01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:02.180]   look at inside of your career and your work,
[01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:03.260]   you know, unique to your thing.
[01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:06.920]   I have a right to ask a question in a meeting.
[01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:08.740]   I have a right to disagree with somebody.
[01:00:08.740 --> 01:00:09.680]   That's a big one.
[01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:11.340]   You can think about it socially too, right?
[01:00:11.340 --> 01:00:12.840]   Like this is a great one.
[01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:15.600]   I have a right to change the subject of a conversation.
[01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:18.700]   Nice people can get trapped on the rails.
[01:00:18.700 --> 01:00:20.060]   Oh, we're talking about their thing.
[01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:20.900]   I don't wanna talk.
[01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:21.940]   How do I get out of this?
[01:00:21.940 --> 01:00:23.500]   And they pause for a minute.
[01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:25.740]   And because you don't have a right to change the subject,
[01:00:25.740 --> 01:00:26.820]   instead of changing the subject,
[01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:29.340]   and then the conversation keeps going and you're trapped,
[01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:30.180]   right?
[01:00:30.180 --> 01:00:31.000]   I lived in that one for a long time.
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.020]   So I have a right to change the subject.
[01:00:32.020 --> 01:00:32.980]   Ooh, here's a good one.
[01:00:32.980 --> 01:00:34.260]   I have a right to interrupt people.
[01:00:34.260 --> 01:00:35.500]   'Cause sometimes you're talking to someone
[01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:37.220]   and they're going on and on and on.
[01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:39.600]   And you say, hey, I wanna ask you something.
[01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:41.460]   That's a great technique for interrupting by the way,
[01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:42.900]   as if it just came to you.
[01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:45.260]   Hey, right in the middle of their sentence.
[01:00:45.260 --> 01:00:46.100]   Blah, blah, blah.
[01:00:46.100 --> 01:00:47.420]   Hey, I just thought of something.
[01:00:47.420 --> 01:00:48.660]   I wanted to ask you something.
[01:00:48.660 --> 01:00:50.900]   And then boom, you can steer it a new direction.
[01:00:50.900 --> 01:00:52.380]   - Wow, so many things.
[01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:54.980]   Last thing, you talked about relationships.
[01:00:54.980 --> 01:00:57.940]   You have kids, I have younger kids.
[01:00:57.940 --> 01:01:00.380]   I feel like what I've taken away from this
[01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:02.580]   is that there's virtually no reason
[01:01:02.580 --> 01:01:05.600]   that confidence wouldn't be a skill to improve for anyone.
[01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:08.140]   How as parents should we think about this
[01:01:08.140 --> 01:01:09.680]   and helping our kids have confidence?
[01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:12.380]   - The biggest transmission to children, bar none,
[01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:13.460]   is modeling.
[01:01:13.460 --> 01:01:17.020]   They're going to observe you all the time.
[01:01:17.020 --> 01:01:20.780]   They're gonna replicate your style of speaking,
[01:01:20.780 --> 01:01:24.140]   your belief systems, your attitudes toward the world.
[01:01:24.140 --> 01:01:27.240]   Later on, they'll rebel and they'll create their own views.
[01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:29.300]   But as young, they're gonna really model you.
[01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:31.940]   Show them is much bigger than telling them.
[01:01:31.940 --> 01:01:33.380]   You might say, I just go out there and do it.
[01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:34.540]   What are you afraid of?
[01:01:34.540 --> 01:01:35.880]   There's no monsters in your room.
[01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:39.540]   But are you boldly approaching the things in your life?
[01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:41.140]   You might say, well, they don't see me at work.
[01:01:41.140 --> 01:01:42.660]   Doesn't matter, they pick up on you
[01:01:42.660 --> 01:01:43.900]   and your essence in the world.
[01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:46.060]   So practice these things yourself.
[01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:48.160]   I love to look for little opportunities
[01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:50.380]   to teach them through games and practice.
[01:01:50.380 --> 01:01:52.980]   So we live out in the country and down our road,
[01:01:52.980 --> 01:01:55.160]   there's this big plot of land that was clear cut.
[01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:56.420]   And there's a trail that goes through.
[01:01:56.420 --> 01:01:59.460]   It ends at this creek and then the trail continues,
[01:01:59.460 --> 01:02:02.300]   but you have to jaunt onto someone's property briefly.
[01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:03.440]   Every time I go down there, I'm like,
[01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:04.940]   I wonder where that trail goes.
[01:02:04.940 --> 01:02:07.360]   But going on people's land randomly out here,
[01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:09.940]   I don't know if that's one of the social freedoms
[01:02:09.940 --> 01:02:10.780]   I want to break.
[01:02:10.780 --> 01:02:12.540]   So I'm there with my son, he's seven.
[01:02:12.540 --> 01:02:14.360]   And I'm like, let's go to the guy's house
[01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:17.020]   and ask him if we can just walk on the edge of his property
[01:02:17.020 --> 01:02:18.260]   and keep going on the trail.
[01:02:18.260 --> 01:02:22.340]   And my seven-year-old's like, no, I don't wanna, I'm scared.
[01:02:22.340 --> 01:02:24.120]   Here's what I do, and this is intentional.
[01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:25.740]   We're walking side by side on our way
[01:02:25.740 --> 01:02:28.180]   to where we would ask the guy and I hold his hand.
[01:02:28.180 --> 01:02:30.340]   So I'm transmitting a message of safety.
[01:02:30.340 --> 01:02:32.360]   We're okay, we're together.
[01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:34.420]   And that's what we would do with the part inside of us
[01:02:34.420 --> 01:02:36.780]   before the action that's like, ah, I'm freaking out.
[01:02:36.780 --> 01:02:38.300]   You like, you don't tell yourself like,
[01:02:38.300 --> 01:02:40.200]   stop being a coward, you suck.
[01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:43.100]   No, we're treating yourself like someone you love,
[01:02:43.100 --> 01:02:44.740]   almost, on my own side.
[01:02:44.740 --> 01:02:48.740]   And so I grab his hand and I'm like, oh, are you afraid?
[01:02:48.740 --> 01:02:49.920]   And he's like, yeah.
[01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:51.080]   And then this really struck me.
[01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:54.020]   He's like, wait, isn't this what you do for work, dad?
[01:02:54.020 --> 01:02:55.740]   Help people that are afraid.
[01:02:55.740 --> 01:02:57.960]   And I was like, as a matter of fact, it is what I do.
[01:02:57.960 --> 01:02:58.800]   Here's what we do.
[01:02:58.800 --> 01:02:59.940]   How about we ask them?
[01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:01.500]   And the worst that he could say is no.
[01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:03.700]   So I'm just modeling for him to bold action.
[01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:06.060]   Then I let him change the level of weight.
[01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:07.220]   He starts getting more scared.
[01:03:07.220 --> 01:03:08.300]   He's like, I don't want to ask.
[01:03:08.300 --> 01:03:10.380]   I was like, well, how about I go to the front door
[01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:13.240]   and you just stay back and you can watch me,
[01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:14.800]   but you don't have to be there.
[01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:15.640]   And he's like, okay.
[01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:17.920]   I titrated it for him as opposed to like forcing him.
[01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:18.940]   'Cause if you try to force them
[01:03:18.940 --> 01:03:20.200]   to do what they're scared of,
[01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:22.340]   that doesn't build the confidence
[01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:23.940]   'cause they're not taking the efficacy.
[01:03:23.940 --> 01:03:27.260]   So I let him hang back, but modeling, watch me.
[01:03:27.260 --> 01:03:29.660]   So I knock on this guy's door, this old man opens the door.
[01:03:29.660 --> 01:03:32.060]   It's already going bad when he opens the door.
[01:03:32.060 --> 01:03:33.880]   He's like, can I help you?
[01:03:35.140 --> 01:03:36.900]   And I was like, just on the edge of your trail.
[01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:37.740]   Can we own the land?
[01:03:37.740 --> 01:03:40.800]   And he's like, no, that's our land back there too.
[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:42.580]   We like to keep it private.
[01:03:42.580 --> 01:03:44.420]   And then I said, okay,
[01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:46.700]   but even if we just go right along the edge,
[01:03:46.700 --> 01:03:47.820]   would that be okay?
[01:03:47.820 --> 01:03:49.380]   And he's like, no, we want to keep it private.
[01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:50.260]   I was like, all right, that's fine.
[01:03:50.260 --> 01:03:51.340]   And then, so we walk away.
[01:03:51.340 --> 01:03:53.540]   We're walking back and my seven-year-old was like,
[01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:55.280]   why did you ask him again?
[01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:57.720]   And I said, you always want to ask twice,
[01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:00.020]   just in case you miss something.
[01:04:00.020 --> 01:04:02.240]   Maybe you could offer a new idea.
[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:04.220]   And he said, he's like, but he said no twice.
[01:04:04.220 --> 01:04:06.340]   And I was like, yeah, well, that's what happens.
[01:04:06.340 --> 01:04:08.560]   If you get a no, you can always ask one more time
[01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:09.740]   'cause maybe they'll change their mind.
[01:04:09.740 --> 01:04:11.860]   So that's a little bit of like teaching and modeling.
[01:04:11.860 --> 01:04:13.060]   I'm playing a long game on this.
[01:04:13.060 --> 01:04:16.260]   This doesn't mean tomorrow he goes and applies all this.
[01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:17.540]   He's shy, both of them are,
[01:04:17.540 --> 01:04:19.620]   especially him as a little new people.
[01:04:19.620 --> 01:04:21.640]   And I don't push him, like you got to do it.
[01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:24.260]   It's more just like creating this spacious,
[01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:28.820]   really long game modeling and knowing that over time,
[01:04:28.820 --> 01:04:32.340]   he'll find his confidence and highlighting his strength.
[01:04:32.340 --> 01:04:33.220]   One last thing I'll say,
[01:04:33.220 --> 01:04:35.320]   which yours are kind of young, so they might not,
[01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:36.820]   this language might not mean a lot to them,
[01:04:36.820 --> 01:04:38.540]   but my kids age seven and nine,
[01:04:38.540 --> 01:04:40.900]   telling them that you're proud of them,
[01:04:40.900 --> 01:04:43.620]   not only when they like score the goal and get the A,
[01:04:43.620 --> 01:04:45.820]   but just like we're sitting there eating breakfast
[01:04:45.820 --> 01:04:47.100]   and I just put my arm around one of them and was like,
[01:04:47.100 --> 01:04:49.300]   hey, I love you, I'm proud of you.
[01:04:49.300 --> 01:04:50.340]   I don't have to explain why.
[01:04:50.340 --> 01:04:52.180]   And you just see them, they're just like their top button,
[01:04:52.180 --> 01:04:56.300]   like, you know, they feel 10 feet tall.
[01:04:56.300 --> 01:04:57.260]   Why am I doing that?
[01:04:57.260 --> 01:05:01.020]   Because we just have this negative toxic critic
[01:05:01.020 --> 01:05:03.540]   in most of us where maybe it's not tearing you down
[01:05:03.540 --> 01:05:05.180]   to the bottom of confidence,
[01:05:05.180 --> 01:05:07.700]   but it's doing a little bit of who do you think you are?
[01:05:07.700 --> 01:05:08.880]   You haven't done enough yet.
[01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:11.220]   And just letting them know that they can feel proud
[01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:13.340]   of themselves without even achieving,
[01:05:13.340 --> 01:05:15.340]   you know, going to the moon or not,
[01:05:15.340 --> 01:05:18.580]   can really build this core sense of I'm on my own side
[01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:19.420]   and I'm worthy.
[01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:20.260]   - I love it.
[01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:22.820]   One-year-old's not really learning a lot of these lessons.
[01:05:22.820 --> 01:05:25.420]   But at three, she was trying to climb this ladder
[01:05:25.420 --> 01:05:26.700]   at this birthday party.
[01:05:26.700 --> 01:05:27.620]   I have a different approach
[01:05:27.620 --> 01:05:29.180]   to how I might've taken that now
[01:05:29.180 --> 01:05:30.680]   than trying to tell her she could do it.
[01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:32.820]   I knew she could do it, but she didn't.
[01:05:32.820 --> 01:05:35.260]   And I have some new ideas that I'll take there.
[01:05:35.260 --> 01:05:36.100]   - Well, one thing is like,
[01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:38.300]   you want me to hold your hand while you do it?
[01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:40.640]   Is there any way that I could be an aid
[01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:42.300]   in getting you to do it yourself?
[01:05:42.300 --> 01:05:43.340]   - That's what we do on the slide.
[01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:44.640]   When there were some steep slides,
[01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:45.480]   she was like, "I don't want to do it."
[01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:46.300]   I was like, "Do you want to hold hands?"
[01:05:46.300 --> 01:05:47.140]   "No."
[01:05:47.140 --> 01:05:47.980]   "Do you want me to come up and go with you?"
[01:05:47.980 --> 01:05:49.200]   - Did you find one that clicked?
[01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:50.040]   - Yes.
[01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:51.100]   And now she's like, "I don't want your hand."
[01:05:51.100 --> 01:05:52.620]   - Aha, there you go.
[01:05:52.620 --> 01:05:54.900]   Make sure that if you encourage them to do the thing though
[01:05:54.900 --> 01:05:57.460]   and they don't, that you yell shame at them
[01:05:57.460 --> 01:05:58.420]   until they're crying.
[01:05:58.420 --> 01:05:59.260]   I'm just kidding.
[01:05:59.260 --> 01:06:01.200]   One last thing I'll say, for your kids age one and three
[01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:02.040]   and anyone you're listening,
[01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:03.760]   even at this age, seven and nine that I have,
[01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:05.360]   but one and three, man,
[01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:07.320]   I just say, give yourself a lot of credit.
[01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:08.800]   You're spending time with them.
[01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:12.120]   You're being on the playground with the slide.
[01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:13.160]   I remember when my kids were that year,
[01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:14.320]   part of me loved it.
[01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:18.300]   And part of me was like, "This day is going on forever."
[01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:20.440]   I'm so bored, you know?
[01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:23.880]   Giving space for that and knowing that at that age,
[01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:28.000]   the most powerful transmission you can do is I see you
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:28.840]   and you matter.
[01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:30.100]   You're not saying that a thousand times a day,
[01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:31.820]   but just your energy, your attention on them.
[01:06:31.820 --> 01:06:33.140]   And I know in this day and age
[01:06:33.140 --> 01:06:34.820]   where we're all overstimulated and stressed,
[01:06:34.820 --> 01:06:36.980]   just like slowing down, this doesn't mean 24/7,
[01:06:36.980 --> 01:06:37.820]   but just, you know, you're there
[01:06:37.820 --> 01:06:39.060]   a certain amount of hours every day.
[01:06:39.060 --> 01:06:40.380]   Hey, I see you, I'm with you.
[01:06:40.380 --> 01:06:43.180]   It sets this foundation also of I'm worthy of attention.
[01:06:43.180 --> 01:06:45.600]   That's really healthy too for confidence.
[01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:47.760]   - I didn't necessarily feel unconfident coming into this,
[01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:49.740]   but I still want to go and work on a lot of this
[01:06:49.740 --> 01:06:51.180]   and kind of level it up.
[01:06:51.180 --> 01:06:52.620]   So thank you so much.
[01:06:52.620 --> 01:06:55.460]   Where can people go get more from you
[01:06:55.460 --> 01:06:56.700]   if they're interested?
[01:06:56.700 --> 01:06:58.640]   - Go to my website, draziz.com.
[01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:01.120]   That's D-R-A-Z-I-Z.com.

[01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:07.280]   And again, you don't have to be in the gutter.
[01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:09.440]   As Chris is pointing out, right, this is about optimizing.
[01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:11.640]   So in there, you'll learn key strategies for free.

[01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:26.480]   So thanks for being here.
[01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:27.320]   I really appreciate it.
[01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:28.620]   - Thanks, Chris.
[01:07:28.620 --> 01:07:30.660]   - Wow, I really enjoyed this episode.
[01:07:30.660 --> 01:07:31.840]   I hope you did too.
[01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:34.560]   In fact, it was so good, I'm quite confident
[01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:36.600]   that if you're still listening, you enjoyed it as well.
[01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:37.720]   So many good takeaways
[01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:39.360]   that I hope you can put to use in your life.
[01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:40.600]   I know I will.

[01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:49.040]   There is no higher praise
[01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:51.240]   than sending a new listener our way.
[01:07:51.240 --> 01:07:52.320]   That's it for this week.
[01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:53.260]   See you next week.
[01:07:53.340 --> 01:07:55.920]   (upbeat music)
[01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:58.240]   (whooshing)
[01:07:58.260 --> 01:08:00.600]   (whooshing)
[01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:03.340]   (birds chirping)
