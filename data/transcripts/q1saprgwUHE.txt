[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.660]   Well, we get about 800 emails per month from listeners like you.
[00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.820]   Eight hundred email questions, and I wish we could answer more of the questions, and
[00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:15.100]   we do our best to keep up.
[00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.100]   Here's today's question.
[00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.100]   "Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.260]   My name is Pedro, and I pastor a church in Granada, Spain.
[00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:28.100]   I would like to ask if there's a danger in Christian hedonism confusing joy and faith."
[00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.940]   There are dangers everywhere.
[00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:38.620]   It would be a mistake to simply make joy and faith identical.
[00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:45.900]   Not because faith doesn't include delight in God, but because faith, as the Bible presents
[00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.820]   it, is more than delight in God.
[00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:59.620]   So I've spent most of my ministry trying to get people to experience faith in such biblical
[00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:06.160]   fullness that it has joy in God as its essence.
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:13.160]   And so, yes, the danger exists that this will be misunderstood as being the same as faith.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.560]   If I say it's the essence of faith, people might say, "Well, then it's the same as faith."
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:26.860]   So let me say a few things that I hope will minimize that danger and clarify what I mean
[00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:34.180]   by faith including joy in God, but being more than joy in God.
[00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.220]   Historically—and I think this goes back at least to the Reformation, I think to the
[00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:45.300]   Fathers—saving faith has been seen as these three things.
[00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:54.020]   Actually the Latin words notitia, knowledge, assensus, assent, fiducia, trust—those three
[00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.720]   together make up saving faith.
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.260]   Faith has an object that it knows, and faith assents to the truth and the reliability of
[00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:09.800]   that object, and then faith actually puts trust in that object.
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:18.740]   And I think the best exponents of that threefold view have intended, when they say trust, to
[00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:27.600]   mean something like what I mean when I say included in that is a delight in the object
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.160]   of the trust.
[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.720]   But what I've done is to say maybe we should add a fourth word to those three, and if we
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:41.800]   wanted to use a Latin word like beatus or felicitas or gaudium, happiness, felicity,
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:42.800]   joy.
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.320]   Let me give an illustration.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.280]   I remember I was with R.C.
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:54.960]   Sproul at one of his conferences, and he had just used an illustration of the chair to
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.600]   illustrate what saving faith is, and he said, "Now you can know that chair is there, and
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:06.320]   you can assent to the fact that it'll hold you up, but will you sit in the chair and
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.040]   thus prove that you're trusting in it?"
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:17.920]   And when I came on to speak after him, I repeated that, and I said, "Yes, yes, yes, and do
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.080]   you love the chair?
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.600]   And is the chair beautiful?
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.880]   And are you satisfied with your fellowship with the chair?"
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.920]   And everybody laughed, of course, and so did R.C.
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:38.400]   He knew that that, in fact, did round out the fuller picture of what saving faith is.
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.840]   If you were trusting Jesus and you thought he were a broken-down, ugly, dilapidated chair
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:48.240]   you'd never want to be around, then the trust of sitting in him wouldn't be what the Bible
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.920]   means by saving faith.
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:04:00.440]   So I want people basically to ask, "Okay, if faith is trust, what are you trusting him
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.880]   for?"
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:11.480]   And if the answer doesn't include Christ himself as our greatest treasure, our greatest hoped-for
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.080]   satisfaction, I don't think we have saving faith.
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:23.120]   If Christ is only a means of getting something other than Christ that you really want, and
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.640]   you don't really want him, you just use him to get what you really want, I don't think
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.120]   that's saving faith.
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.320]   And the Gospel of John, I think, makes that pretty clear in a couple of ways.
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.000]   You know, everybody knows John 1, 11 and 12.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.520]   He came to his own.
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:45.160]   His own people did not receive him, but to all who did receive him, who believed in his
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.320]   name, he gave the right to become the children of God.
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:54.280]   So believing is a receiving of Jesus for who he is.
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.960]   And as what, then?
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.440]   How are you receiving him?
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.440]   Savior?
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.440]   Yes.
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.440]   Lord?
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:01.440]   Yes.
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.440]   And I want to say, "Treasure."
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:07.280]   You have to receive Jesus as your treasure, not just receive him as Savior and Lord.
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:13.080]   And I think that's made clear in John 6, 35, where Jesus says, "I'm the bread of life.
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:19.400]   Whoever comes to me shall not hunger, and whoever believes in me shall never thirst."
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:25.640]   So we're coming to Jesus to have our thirst satisfied in him and our hunger satisfied
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.920]   in him.
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:35.760]   He's the joy that we've always wanted, and we embrace him as that in the act of saving
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.380]   faith.
[00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:42.720]   So when we have saving faith, what are we trusting Jesus for?
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:52.120]   We're trusting him to remove every obstacle and bring us to God as our fullest satisfaction,
[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.560]   1 Peter 3, 18.
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:59.560]   Christ suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.080]   to God.
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.040]   That's what we're trusting him to do.
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:11.800]   And so delight in God as our all-satisfying goal and treasure is in faith.
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:17.520]   So that's what he died for, that's what we trust him for, and trusting him to bring us
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:24.080]   to God means trusting him that God is our fullest soul's satisfaction.
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.000]   So here's my conclusion.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:33.640]   Yes, faith includes knowing the fact of Christ and assenting to the truth of the fact and
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:41.780]   trusting in him and treasuring him as the best promise of all.
[00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:46.080]   So faith is more than being satisfied in God.
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:51.880]   So the question was, is there a danger of confusing them or making them mean the same
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:52.880]   thing?
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:58.320]   And yes, the danger's there, but I hope I've made clear it is an essential part of saving
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.440]   faith, but it's not the whole thing.
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:01.440]   Excellent.
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.400]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:04.920]   And thank you, Pedro, for the question.
[00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:09.000]   Another wonderful text on the relationship between faith and joy is found in 2 Corinthians
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.040]   24 in the context of pastoral ministry.
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:16.760]   See episode number 303 of the Ask Pastor John series in an episode we titled "The Greatest
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.960]   Threat to Pastoral Ministry."
[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.940]   For more, again, that's episode number 303.
[00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:25.440]   On Monday, we're back with another new episode of the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:30.080]   So how is divine election not divine favoritism?
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.280]   I'll ask Pastor John that very question on Monday.
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:33.280]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:34.360]   Have a wonderful weekend.
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:34.760]   [END]
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:35.760]   1.
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:36.760]   Is there a danger of confusing them or making them mean the same thing?
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:37.760]   1.
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:38.760]   Is there a danger of confusing them or making them mean the same thing?
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:39.760]   2.
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:40.760]   Is there a danger of confusing them or making them mean the same thing?
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:41.760]   3.
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:42.760]   Is there a danger of confusing them or making them mean the same thing?
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:43.760]   4.
