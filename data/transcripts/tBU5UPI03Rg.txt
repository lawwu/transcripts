[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.360]   if you're on a run rate where you're raising 5 billion bucks every two years, okay? So give or
[00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:11.920]   take that's, you know, $50 billion over a 10-year period of time, a 2% on 50 billion, it's a billion.
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.640]   Okay? A billion a year.
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.640]   Right. Let's just be clear.
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:34.080]   Right. So underscore that for everybody, Bill. Great to have you here. Great to see you in
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.960]   Austin this weekend. Congrats on 25 years of marriage.
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:37.680]   Thank you very much.
[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:44.000]   That was, it was a really fun time. And you know, I went by J Cal's, saw his new place.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.480]   Yeah.
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.320]   Saw so many friends when I was there. Austin's really, really bumping right now.
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.040]   I agree.
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.240]   Seriously, just an amazing number of people now calling at home. And I know that,
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:01:01.040]   you know, you recently took your dad who worked at NASA down to see the launch of Starship 5.
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:08.240]   Yeah. And I, look, I'm so grateful that SpaceX was able to make this happen for my dad's 88.
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.080]   And we'd been talking about getting him down there to see a launch. And they
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:18.400]   put us in this VIP section, which made it easy for him to move around. And he was just in awe.
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.760]   You know, I'd maybe start this discussion by telling you, on the way home from the launch,
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:30.080]   I did a search for my dad's name and NASA. And I found this document. It says, "A sketch prepared
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.200]   by John Gurley demonstrates the spacecraft's skip when entering the Earth's atmosphere."
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.200]   So this was hand drawn by my dad.
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.080]   Come on.
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:45.040]   And if you look here, "Memorandum John R. Gurley to Chief Flight Operations." That's Chris Kraft.
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:52.320]   So my dad wrote this to Chris Kraft, "A study of skips range sensitivities and allowable errors
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.280]   in exit conditions applicable to Apollo missions."
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.040]   How cool is that?
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.280]   June 12th, 1963.
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.360]   And you just took him down to Boca Chica?
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.160]   He was 26 years old when he wrote that.
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.200]   What's the average age of the guys down at Boca Chica?
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.080]   26.
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.760]   Oh, 29.
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:10.320]   Yeah.
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.800]   Yeah.
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.040]   Yeah. What was it like being down there with your pops?
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:20.000]   It was awesome. It was awesome. So I grew up in a town called Dickinson, which was near Clear Lake.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.880]   And my father worked for NASA. And he worked there from very early. When they commissioned NASA,
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:33.840]   they took 50 people from NACA, I think it was called, which was on the Langley Air Force Base.
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.200]   And that's where he had started his career. And they moved him to Houston. So I'm a Texan,
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:45.920]   probably because of LBJ's pork barrel politics. But we grew up on a space street. Half the fathers
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:52.160]   on the street were NASA. And the Apollo launches, it's just like you see in the Apollo 13 movie,
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.320]   you go over to someone's house, if you didn't drive 16 hours to the launch.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.120]   Yeah.
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:03.280]   And yeah, it was just part of our lives. We had a wall in the house with all the Apollo launch
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:10.480]   things. And it was really like until he took early retirement in the late '80s, it was just
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.920]   part of our lives. And so to have him down there, and he's-
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.240]   So you went for Starship 5, the launch.
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:22.560]   Yeah. And I'd been trying to do it for a while because he's 88. And all of his former colleagues
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:29.600]   that are still alive are kind of in awe of what Elon's doing and super appreciative. Because
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:36.960]   for them, the space mission was something that meant a lot to them. And they kind of felt like
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:44.400]   the government quit trying. And so to see it rebirth just gets them super excited. And of
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.280]   course, we were there to witness. It was very lucky that this was the one I took him to because
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.960]   we witnessed the booster coming back, which was-
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.840]   How was that? Was it emotional for your dad?
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.600]   Yeah. Oh, definitely. Definitely.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:03.360]   Yeah. And you look at it today, the average age at SpaceX, probably about the same age
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.680]   as your dad was when he- Yeah, he talked about that. We
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:11.120]   went to an after party and all the SpaceX, not all of them, some of them were SpaceX employees
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.800]   were there. And it was a very young crowd. Yeah. But that to me is part of the magic,
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:24.640]   right? That believing you can see how mission driven they are. And we have lots of friends
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.480]   who work there, work there. And it's great to see America cheering for it.
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:35.200]   I've even heard stories that people, just because you start looking around, I've heard stories,
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.480]   people leave SpaceX and go work somewhere else and just inevitably come back.
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:49.440]   Elon has said that we need aspirations. We need dreams. We need to think about the stars in order
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:56.480]   to inspire us to invent. And that's part of the purpose of being human. And I certainly know with
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:02.320]   my kids and my family, we feel that way. So, super cool you're able to take your dad down there.
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:03.760]   Yeah, it was great. It was great. Great.
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:09.600]   On Sunday morning, I went on a walk with our friend, Michael Dell. I always learn something
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:17.600]   from him. And the thing that dawned on me, he's not one to get hyperbolic about things. He's been
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:23.520]   at this a really long time. And he's like, we're in that grindy phase now where he's really starting
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:30.160]   to see the benefits of AI, right? Inside Dell, inside his customers, other enterprises, finding
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:36.480]   ways to take, to find efficiencies in their business. I think we're entering that, what
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:42.000]   could be a really golden era where there's market leaders extend their lead, where their margins
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:48.720]   expand. I just saw a headline today that Visa is finding more efficiencies from AI, is letting
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:55.680]   1400 contractors and workers go. And I just think this is the beginning of a drumbeat that we're
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:02.240]   going to hear for a decade. He said, just at the very beginning of companies really starting to
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:08.480]   think about ways they can improve their business. And it's not the sexy chat GPT stuff. This is the
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:15.680]   real pedestrian stuff by using AI to basically translate documents into a hundred different
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:22.160]   countries. One of my observations and a fun thing to come out of that walk. But there are a few
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:28.560]   topics I want to hit on today, including the latest on AI and GPU scaling. And I want to hit on the
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:33.520]   topic of how we're thinking about the markets heading into the election. But I want to start
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:37.920]   with a topic that I know is near and dear to your heart, which is the state of venture capital.
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:38.320]   Yeah.
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.760]   Okay. So my partner, Jam and Ball, who we're going to bring in here in just a minute,
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:51.200]   wrote this week on his blog that VC funding sizes have ballooned, that the incentives for VCs have
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:57.120]   shifted perhaps a bit, maybe now focused a little bit more on this cadence of raising and deploying
[00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:03.760]   every couple of years, as much money as possible, which may create some incentive alignment problems
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:09.280]   with founders. The key question he told founders they need to ask is, are you partnering with a
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:17.120]   2% or a 20% venture firm, which I thought was clever. So you then retweeted his post and said,
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:23.040]   it's a must read for all LPs and money managers and called it the single most important issue in
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:28.960]   the VC landscape today. So first welcome Jammin. You know, I thought maybe just start with you,
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:35.360]   summarize for us the blog post and kind of maybe why you wrote it.
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:40.800]   Yeah. Well, so I write this blog Clouded Judgment and it has many goals. One goal
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:46.880]   is to increase the transparency to founders of what goes on in the venture markets. The
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:50.880]   venture markets have changed a lot over the last 10, 15 years. I think Bill, it was maybe you or
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:55.280]   someone else, many people have said this, right? The venture markets have transitioned from
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:01.120]   a high margin cottage industry to a institutionalized lower margin industry.
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:05.680]   And that has a lot of implications, implications for LPs, implications for GPs
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:13.360]   and implications for founders. This post focused more on the founder GP leg of the stool.
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:19.520]   And I wanted to focus on that leg because I do think that the implications of this transition
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:24.720]   to an institutionalized asset class, it changes the game for founders that I don't think they're
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:30.240]   fully aware of what, of all the implications. And I had a lot of, I've had a lot of conversation
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:33.280]   with founders over the last few months that really highlighted that to me.
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:38.960]   So before diving into how have the incentives changed and how are they diverging a bit more
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:45.040]   amongst founders and GPs, you know, first we'll just describe what the incentives are for the
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:49.200]   audience, just to make it quite clear. So in venture funds, I'm sure folks have heard of the
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:56.960]   two and 20 model that is a 2% management fee and 20% carry. There's a guaranteed portion of
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:01.920]   funds comp, which is the management fee. It's a percent of the fund size that you'll collect
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:07.920]   every year. And then there's the carry, which is the funds share of profits. So take a hundred
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:13.760]   million dollar fund that you 3X, you'll take 2 million a year in management fees. You generate
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:20.800]   200 million of profits, which is 40 million of carry. 10, 15 years ago, the funds were smaller.
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:26.800]   And as a GP, as an investor, you'll make money on that guaranteed portion, but not necessarily,
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.680]   right, as I call it, get rich money. Bill, what were you making when you
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:34.960]   started per year when you started in the business? No, but I would say on average,
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:39.680]   people are making a couple hundred thousand bucks a year working in the venture business.
[00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:42.800]   Nobody was getting rich on that management fee. Keep going, Jeremy.
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:47.760]   That's right. So if you wanted to get rich, you had to maximize your carry. The way to maximize
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:52.880]   your carry was to maximize the value of the underlying investments that you made, which
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:58.720]   resulted in a path of getting rich for founders, which also resulted in getting rich for investors,
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:04.240]   right? The incentives are aligned. Let's fast forward to today. Funds are much bigger. That
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:10.400]   $400 million fund is now 4 billion. That guaranteed portion of comp, the 2%, the management fee,
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:15.360]   you can now get rich on. And the reality is, is a path exists today-
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:18.640]   In that case, roughly 80 million a year. That's right.
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:21.680]   For a $4 billion fund. That's right. And so they're now-
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:27.040]   And you could imagine the managing partner taking a quarter of that, a third of that.
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:29.760]   10, 15 million bucks a year. Yeah.
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:36.560]   Right. And so now there's a path where investors, GPs get rich, where the outcome of the founders
[00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:41.200]   and their companies is irrelevant. Not to say they are aligned in opposite directions,
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:48.240]   but they're no longer aligned. And now, as a rational actor, you could say, "Why not maximize
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:53.440]   the guaranteed portion of the comp, the 2% versus caring about the 20%?" And that leads to some
[00:10:53.440 --> 00:11:01.280]   pervasive incentives where funds incentives are more about deploying dollars quickly as opposed
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:07.520]   to maximizing the value of those deployed dollars. There's a lot of downstream implications of that.
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:13.440]   It leads to companies, early companies that show early traction, get flooded with offers and
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:18.480]   investment dollars. And we can talk about why overcapitalizing and overvaluing your business
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:23.440]   actually can pose a risk. I think one of the reasons I wanted to write this post was I thought
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:27.760]   we would have learned a lot of lessons coming out of 2021 that it's very clear we haven't,
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:30.720]   or we just choose to ignore because the incentives are no longer there.
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:36.400]   But for founders, I think understanding and appreciating, are you partnering? Are you
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:42.160]   marrying a firm that is more focused and caring about maximizing the value of your company
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:47.360]   together? Or are you partnering with a firm that just wants to deploy dollars as quickly as
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:51.120]   possible? And there's lots of things we can double click on, but that was kind of the broad
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:54.640]   rationale for the post or the quick summary of it.
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:58.880]   - And by the way, I mean, rather than say they only care about the management fee,
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:04.000]   they may view the other one, there's a phrase in poker called a free roll. They may view it
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.200]   as a free roll. I'm getting rich no matter what. - It's a lottery ticket.
[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.200]   - Right. - It's a call option.
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:15.680]   - But this other, it's a call option. And if this company happens to be the next Google,
[00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:20.800]   the next Meta, we've seen how those compound over 20 years and it'll work out.
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:22.480]   - Right. - It'll work out in that case,
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:27.200]   or maybe it'll work out for one of the 10 that I'm putting 400 million in and then I'll be okay.
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:30.560]   - Right. As investors, we get to make many bets. As founders, you have one.
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:33.200]   - Right, exactly. - And one of the things we were
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:38.560]   talking about just earlier today is for founders, there are implicit things you are signing up for
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:44.160]   by taking a round that is too much money at too high of a valuation. I think the preference stack
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:48.560]   and preference in general is something that is sometimes understood by founders in the founding
[00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:54.240]   community, but not always understood. There are companies that can be sold for $100, $200 million
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:59.280]   that results in life-changing outcomes for founders and early employees. If you raised $100
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:05.920]   million too early, that exit path is no longer on the table. You can't sell the business for $100
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:10.560]   million and make any money because that just returns the preference stack. As the call option
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:13.840]   investor, your call option didn't hit, but you get your money back.
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:18.400]   - Well, let's drill down. Let's split this into two sections because I think
[00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:27.040]   that this thing that's happening and the reason I retweeted it has implications for both founders
[00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:30.320]   and companies, but the asset class also. - That's right.
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:36.320]   - So, we started down this path. Let's do it first. What does it mean for a company to
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:41.120]   have maybe too much money crammed into it at too high a price?
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:47.360]   - Yeah. There's many deep implications of this. One thing that I've learned
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:53.840]   that I hold, that I will argue with anyone on is every founder and every company and every board
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:57.200]   will tell you, "If we raise money, we're not going to spend it. We're going to stay frugal."
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:59.120]   That never happens. - Yeah, never.
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:02.960]   - And instead of focusing on, you might ask a founder, "What are the three things that matter
[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:07.680]   most this year that are critical for your success?" If you only focused on those three things,
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:12.480]   you might maximize your chance of success. When you have lots of money, you're going to do six
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:15.600]   things at once, which means you are diluting the three things that matter.
[00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:23.280]   - Let's stay on this for a long time. So, many, many, many great people have said that
[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:31.680]   constraints drive creativity. I've heard famous stories about Steve Jobs where he felt his job
[00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:37.360]   was just to say, "I want it this thin. Go figure it out." And by saying that, he limited the space.
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:42.800]   "We're not going to build a phone." And then people can focus and be creative.
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:49.120]   You've constantly heard, "We're going to make a better decision because we're going to have
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:54.800]   constraints, and we're only going to be in two markets, not five." If you're in five,
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:15:02.720]   guess what happens when revenue starts to slow? You've built some of your revenue in these places
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:11.600]   where you don't have a strong competitive advantage. Those churn out. And so, you've
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:17.760]   grown revenue faster, but it's less sustainable revenue, is another thing that can happen.
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:26.320]   - Well, when I look at this, if we look at the poster child or children for what went wrong
[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:33.600]   during peak Zerp, okay? So, if your incentive is to deploy so that you can raise again in two years,
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:38.960]   then you're going to want to get maximum dollars into the business. Well, there may be only so
[00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:44.480]   many primary dollars you can get into the business. And then we started to see this desire to buy
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:49.120]   secondary shares because I wanted to get more dollars into the business. I wanted to deploy
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:53.600]   more in the company, even though you were buying common shares that were much riskier. And then,
[00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:59.120]   oftentimes, Bill, something I know you love, the founders or founding team were taking big dollars
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:05.120]   off the table, oftentimes before product market fit. And I think, you know, Jamin and I have
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:11.920]   discussed that we came out of this 20 to 22 period, and we would have thought that we would
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:20.640]   have seen less of that, right? Because we have, as you've discussed, 1,400 companies, right? 90%
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:25.840]   of which are going to have to do a down round, IPO or otherwise, in order to get through the system.
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:32.560]   But somehow the echoes of that period have not reverberated that loud, right? The incentives
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:39.760]   to deploy much bigger rounds into these companies continue to persist. And so, you know,
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:45.200]   gets back to your point about scarcity. Not only are you putting so much money in the business that
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:49.520]   perhaps they're not being as focused as they would otherwise be, but you really question
[00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:55.360]   whether or not the incentives for the founder are there. If you're taking 10, 20, 50, 100 million
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:17:00.400]   dollars off the table before the company has achieved profitability, then do you really have
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:06.000]   the fire in the belly needed to get, you know, both parties? And without picking on anybody,
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:12.640]   there are numerous examples from previous waves of even the founders like not being in the building
[00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:17.920]   or not showing up. So that can definitely happen. But there's so much more that can happen. I mean,
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:25.920]   one thing that happens is you create a prisoner's dilemma with your competitors where they feel
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:31.680]   forced to raise the same amount of money. And now you have multiple overfunded companies in
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:37.920]   a single category. Right. Just taking shots. So it's not only too much money within the firm
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:44.480]   that's causing the firm to be less fit, less efficient, less, you know, inventive, but it's
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:50.080]   also creating this dynamic where you used to talk about, you know, capital is a weapon of economic
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:55.280]   destruction. You have excess capital causing excess competition. So the natural market winner
[00:17:55.280 --> 00:18:00.160]   does not emerge as fast as they otherwise would. Well, maybe to level set the conversation.
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:05.920]   Can I mention one more thing? Sure, sure. That I think becomes a reality. And we've talked about
[00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:14.240]   this before, but I find far too often that founders think about raising money at a particular
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:21.600]   valuation as if they've earned an award. They've won a prize. They've proven their company is worth
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:28.080]   this thing. And they can then show the world the trophy and say, we've achieved X. And I always
[00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:36.400]   try and remind them that valuations represent discounted future expectations. And so you may
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:42.800]   feel like you've won a prize, but you've really increased everyone's expectation for what this
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:50.240]   company can achieve. And in order to raise that up round from here, it's way harder than it would
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:55.680]   have been otherwise. Right. And perhaps way more dilutive. I mean, the reality is even if you're
[00:18:55.680 --> 00:19:02.320]   getting what appears to be a high valuation, if you truly think you're one of those seminal
[00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:09.840]   businesses, you look at the ownership today that Zuckerberg has or Bezos had, because they raised
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:15.920]   so little capital in those businesses. And they compounded over a much longer period of time in
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:21.520]   the public market. And let me drive home this point, I think, in a very, very stark way, which
[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:25.600]   is we're borrowing a number from the Code 2 presentation, but they said there were, what,
[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:32.000]   1,400 unicorns that are still private from what I like to call the pre-LLM period.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.440]   What percentage of those could raise enough round right now? What is the number?
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:40.320]   I think it's less than 10%. It might be less than 5%.
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:45.040]   Today, yes. So that means there's over a thousand private
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:51.360]   unicorns that are somewhat stuck right now and could not raise enough round. So this risk I'm
[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:56.880]   talking about, about putting too high a valuation on your company, we've just had this experience
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:02.400]   in this massive fact pattern. But you're right, we're still doing it. AI came along,
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:09.200]   and it has so much potential and all the things you're excited about that brought the money in.
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:18.400]   And the money's back in. And I'm seeing activity that is at least no different than what we saw
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:24.400]   in the past, and maybe even more frothy. Let's come back to that. But I do want to
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:30.720]   level set to the total amount of VC that's actually being raised and deployed. And this
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:39.600]   first slide we have here just shows that we peaked in Zurb in 2021 at over 700 billion deployed.
[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:44.400]   We've come back down to about 300 billion deployed, which is still meaningfully above where
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:53.920]   we were in 2014, 2015, but we're back to about 2017, 2018 levels. But it kind of hides a couple
[00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:59.840]   of things. Number one, the number of first-time funds raising a second-time fund has plummeted.
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:04.560]   The number of first-time funds have plummeted. And so really what's happening is you have the
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:12.080]   consolidation among a few big platforms. Just this week, we saw that General Catalyst has raised
[00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:16.480]   $8 billion in new capital. Now, of course, I love my friends at General Catalyst, but
[00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:25.120]   just 24 months ago, they raised $4.5 billion. So that's $13 billion raised in that 24-month period.
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:32.320]   Similarly, Lightspeed recently announced that they raised $7 billion after raising about $6.5
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:38.240]   billion, so another $13 or $14 billion over kind of that 28, 30-month period of time.
[00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:46.160]   Clearly, LPs are raising their hands and saying, "We don't mind these larger funds. The capital is
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:54.320]   available for them." What do you think that they're concluding? If you believe that this is
[00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:59.440]   going to fundamentally reduce the returns of the entire asset class, then what must be going
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:04.160]   through the minds of those LPs to want to back those much larger businesses?
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:08.720]   That raises so many different questions. One thing I would highlight is that when,
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:15.520]   you know, my whole career in the venture industry and prior, because I read about the history before
[00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:21.280]   I joined, the industry was inherently cyclical and there would be these boom-bust periods.
[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:28.080]   And they're very long waves, partially because of the construct of the agreement between the
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:35.120]   GPs and LPs, which used to be a 10-year thing, and now it's like a 15-, 16-year thing. And so,
[00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:44.400]   the window for which you would evaluate whether someone can accurately or successfully deploy
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:50.960]   a $4 billion fund might be 20 years. And we just started raising them that big.
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:59.360]   So, no one knows. Like, no one knows. They're raising money off of paper marks, you know,
[00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:06.000]   from this period. And it's just, the cycle's forever. It's beyond the lifetime of most
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:12.800]   GPs' career left to be done, which gets back to the 2%, 20%.
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:19.120]   And I think it kind of depends. I think one way to, one argument or one lens to look through when
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:23.680]   trying to predict will it work is everyone will look at venture funds and there's kind of this
[00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:30.400]   view and belief that the bigger you get, the later stage you invest, you can more evenly
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:36.720]   distribute your returns in a fund to achieve a top quartile return. That, I would say,
[00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:42.880]   I strongly disagree with. All of the numbers that we've seen suggest that to have a top quartile
[00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:48.560]   fund, you need to have outlier power law outcomes within the fund. You won't evenly distribute them.
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:53.200]   So, I think one way to look at this is to say, and this is the way we talk internally,
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:57.360]   what does it take to have a power law outcome at a certain stage? At the seed stage, you might have
[00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:02.560]   this many companies that could get you a power law outcome and return your fund. Series A, Series B,
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:06.880]   Series C. And it's just, it's a downward funnel of the number of companies that could give you
[00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:13.040]   power law outcomes. I think one of the challenges is if you're investing just in growth stage,
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:18.480]   there's only so many companies you can invest in that can give you power law outcomes.
[00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:22.320]   And so, you are almost inherently widening the aperture to do more
[00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:25.680]   than what could be a power law outcome, the larger and larger you get.
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:26.480]   I agree with that.
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:33.120]   So, I think that the burden of proof is on the picking of the large funds to say,
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:39.760]   we will pick and hit those power law outcomes, but then have a much higher hit rate on the rest.
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:45.120]   And so, it won't be this big power law outcome. It will have the power law and then be more
[00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:50.960]   evenly distributed in the long tail, which it can happen. It's just really hard, especially
[00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:56.400]   when your incentives are just to deploy to raise the next fund. It's, are you giving up or saying,
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:25:00.160]   "Hey, I don't care. Picking is too hard. I don't need to do it." In which case,
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:04.080]   maybe you get the power law, maybe you don't, but you're just naturally going to capture more
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:08.800]   of the long tail, which I think ultimately will dilute a lot of those returns.
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:11.680]   And so, we'll see how it plays out. That's the fun part of it.
[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:16.560]   Or not, or not. I mean, this is kind of Bill's point. So, if you're on a run rate where you're
[00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:23.200]   raising 5 billion bucks every two years, okay? So, give or take, that's $50 billion over a 10
[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:30.080]   year period of time. A 2% on 50 billion, it's a billion. Okay? So, now it just-
[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:33.520]   A billion a year. Let's just be clear.
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:38.320]   Right, right, right. So, underscore that for everybody, Bill, right? Because
[00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:43.280]   these funds layer on top of one another. So, you're getting paid on multiple funds.
[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:43.760]   Correct.
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:48.560]   And that's the guaranteed portion. Now, these firms are much larger firms,
[00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:53.760]   much more institutionalized. To Jamin's point, they're going to have to spread their bets over
[00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:59.360]   a much, much wider field. So, the potential that you're going to have enough ownership
[00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:06.080]   in a power law business to earn venture-like returns is much lower. But I think you also
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:10.400]   made the point that maybe what you're doing is your mortality rate goes down.
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:15.040]   And so, you're giving more confidence. But Bill's point is, we don't know.
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:15.600]   You remember that.
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:21.200]   The experiment's never really been run in venture at this scale. And we would have thought that
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:26.800]   coming out of the Vision Fund experiment, right? We had all these comments during Vision Fund
[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:31.040]   that we wouldn't see, you know, kind of this cadence of these size of funds.
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:38.240]   And then if you want to take some targeted big bets, say in an open AI or something like that,
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:42.640]   there may be only one or two of those that come around every couple of years.
[00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:44.160]   Every year, maybe every 10 years.
[00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:51.360]   And so, you place a lot of wood behind a couple big bets. But then your traditional venture fund
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:56.880]   is smaller such that it can generate those historical venture-like returns.
[00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:02.960]   But I haven't seen any math that I find compelling how you can get to a 4 to 5X fund
[00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:05.680]   on, right, that $5 billion pool of capital.
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:11.280]   Well, in fact, yeah. I mean, in 2011, there was this famous report by the Kauffman Foundation
[00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:17.280]   that argued that billion-dollar-plus funds had never had good returns.
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:20.240]   And of course, after that, everyone raised billion-dollar funds.
[00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:24.640]   But I have this story I want to share with you that relates to this in a funny way.
[00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:31.200]   I was at one point in time invited into the office of this PE firm. I didn't know PE very well.
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:36.560]   But they had backed DoubleClick and Google bought it for $3.1 billion.
[00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:41.200]   And this particular firm made-- I forget, they had a lot of it.
[00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:43.200]   So they made like a billion or a billion two.
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:47.280]   And I said to him, I always say, "Congratulations, man. That's incredible."
[00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:49.840]   He goes, "Well, it's in a $4 billion fund."
[00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:51.200]   Wow, wow.
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:52.000]   You know?
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.200]   So you have an incredible outcome.
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:56.080]   Right, right.
[00:27:56.080 --> 00:28:03.120]   But the denominator is so big that it's just hard to claw it back.
[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:04.720]   It's hard to get back to that number.
[00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:09.680]   Which is why you can't get to the 4 or 5X because you have a power law outcome,
[00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:12.960]   and it returns 25% or a third of the fund.
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:13.440]   Correct.
[00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:14.000]   Right?
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:19.120]   What we've witnessed is kind of this bill coming out of the '22 period,
[00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:23.920]   these two paths effectively, you know, that the firms have followed.
[00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:26.240]   We've seen some firms downsize.
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:30.000]   Founders Fund, Altimeter, a few others have downsized the fund size.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.320]   But we've seen other funds that just said,
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:35.360]   you know, we're going to consolidate and we're going to get way bigger.
[00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:41.680]   And so I do think that, you know, if we look at a little bit of returns math on this.
[00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:44.000]   So we have a few slides.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.360]   But, you know, I love, you know, Fred Wilson's rule of thumb.
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:51.760]   You know, a third of companies fail, a third basically underperform,
[00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:54.400]   and then a third gets you your 5 to 10X returns.
[00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:57.760]   And recent breaks it down even more, which, you know,
[00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:03.200]   says it all comes down to the 10% that produce, you know, kind of that 10X fund.
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:08.320]   And if you look at this stepstone data, you know, it actually shows that, you know,
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:12.560]   basically what differentiates those top tier funds.
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:19.680]   And by top tier, what I mean is that the top 5% of Decile funds,
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:25.120]   they're earning about a 4.5X, you know, cash on cash return in their funds.
[00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:29.520]   You know, you go back and you can look across all of these vintages over the last 20 years.
[00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:34.400]   Now, I think there's a question whether or not any of these mega funds on these
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:38.080]   $4 or $5 billion funds are going to be able to, you know, generate those returns.
[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:42.800]   And maybe the reality is that these new LPs, pension funds,
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:47.440]   sovereign wealth funds, and others, look at these as strategically important.
[00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:52.160]   And they, you know, they're less concerned about venture-like returns,
[00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:54.240]   and they want to protect the downside more.
[00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:59.680]   And so maybe you can sell the fact that you're going to have less mortality, right?
[00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:02.560]   And you're going to have less downside risk to the funds.
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:05.920]   But I mean, I think that that is really where the rubber meets the road.
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:11.200]   You know, when we look back at this, you know, this analysis, whether or not these funds are
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:17.520]   going to be able to generate returns that are equivalent to the top Decile of historical.
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:22.640]   One of the things we don't know that it would be really hard to gather data and prove,
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:29.600]   but this zombie unicorn class, pre-LLM zombie unicorn class, you know,
[00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:32.320]   had it not been flooded with money.
[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:37.840]   And, you know, there's a notion in science called the observer effect, you know,
[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:42.640]   where if, you know, VCs are too big and like,
[00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:46.240]   do you actually impact the results of the game on the field?
[00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:52.720]   And, you know, had that not happened, and these companies grew up on a normal way,
[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:58.240]   you know, in a more organic, you know, growth path, would they have had more liquidity?
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:00.560]   Would they have had more investor returns?
[00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:05.680]   Would they have been more acquirable without these high marks on their head?
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:12.160]   And so did you take out, you know, you're so, we're so focused on the outlier,
[00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:14.640]   you know, breakout Google meta types.
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:15.520]   Did you ruin-
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:17.680]   - The two, three, four X returns?
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:18.080]   - Yes.
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:18.320]   - Yeah.
[00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:19.360]   - Did those go away?
[00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:20.080]   - Yeah.
[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:24.000]   I think you totally removed it as an outcome path, right?
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.600]   Which is to say, when you are investing in these companies at high prices,
[00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:30.880]   the only thing as an investor you care about is, are you an outlier outcome?
[00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:32.000]   Are you a 10X plus?
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:32.560]   - Right.
[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:36.320]   - As a founder, you might say, I don't need that.
[00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:39.040]   As employees, you might say, I don't need that.
[00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:42.640]   And if I was sitting on a $600 million valuation, not 6 billion,
[00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:46.960]   it's going to be much different to go and sell the business for 2 billion
[00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:48.800]   when the prep stack isn't one and a half, right?
[00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:54.800]   So I think we've just, we removed a thick middle of an outcomes
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:58.240]   that would be relevant to everyone outside of the investors,
[00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:03.920]   where now the only outcome that's relevant to anyone is, are you a 10X or are you a zero?
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:05.360]   And you made it a binary outcome-
[00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:05.840]   - I agree.
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:07.120]   - For all constituents.
[00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:09.120]   - And you force everyone into that game.
[00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:09.680]   - Right.
[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:14.880]   - Obviously, all three of us are in an industry.
[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:18.960]   We believe it's the engine, you know, that provides the fuel for,
[00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:22.160]   you know, incredible founders to go innovate the future.
[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:28.400]   And it's really just a question of whether or not we're overcapitalizing the business,
[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:32.160]   whether funds are getting too big, but what recommendations, Bill,
[00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:38.640]   might you have or Jamin, for founders or funders, right?
[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:44.400]   Jamin, what I hear you saying is founders just be aware, right?
[00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:45.440]   Ask the questions.
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:45.920]   - Then know what you're signing up for.
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:49.520]   - Think through the people you're putting in your capital structure
[00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:51.840]   and like what their incentives are.
[00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:54.240]   Are they sitting on 20 different boards?
[00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:59.280]   Are they clearly in the deployment mode rather than the investment mode?
[00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:01.680]   And if they're in the deployment mode, just know that.
[00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:04.880]   - And know what you're implicitly signing up for.
[00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:07.440]   What bets are you making, not just on your behalf,
[00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:12.720]   but on your entire employee base's behalf, where do they want the binary bet?
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:14.720]   Binary bets are okay for investors.
[00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:18.720]   I don't think early employees or founders necessarily want that.
[00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:21.360]   But I'd say that, you know, know what implicit bets you're making.
[00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:23.760]   Buy the rounds that you're raising.
[00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:30.960]   - Yeah, I mean, to that point, like this is super simple math,
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:35.600]   but if you raise 400 million or let's just say 100 million,
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:40.160]   even if you're being conservative, what are you going to spend that over?
[00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:42.880]   36 months, you know, something like that.
[00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:47.440]   You're still signing up for a three, four million a month burn rate.
[00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:53.040]   And there's no way that doesn't represent risk in some way.
[00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:57.040]   And the bigger you take that number,
[00:33:57.040 --> 00:34:00.080]   I used to always think about venture capital as,
[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:06.000]   you know, you invest in a company and you grow that burn up until a point.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.240]   And then the job is to converge back against it and go to profitability.
[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:17.520]   And with all this money, I mean, we're taking that point up to 10 million a month,
[00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:18.560]   20 million a month.
[00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:22.240]   And this gets into who can grow out of that.
[00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:22.640]   - Right.
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:26.160]   - And it ties into did you destroy that middle?
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:29.440]   Because some of them just can't ever get there.
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:32.960]   - And you then rely on the beneficence of the capital markets
[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:34.480]   to keep feeding that machine.
[00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:39.680]   And sometimes it runs out and then you're in a massive course correction.
[00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:46.640]   - But my general response is unfortunately more sanguine,
[00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:50.560]   which is I think these systems are emergent.
[00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:56.800]   I don't think any one person made a willful decision to force this reality.
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:57.200]   - Correct.
[00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:02.640]   - I think it emerged out of a combination of what was happening with interest rates
[00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:09.600]   and Zerp and then the rise of AI and maybe the globalization of fundraising
[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:11.520]   that brought sovereign wealth in.
[00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:16.880]   And it all kind of combined and created this mix that we're living with.
[00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:21.360]   And for the most part, I think we're all actors stuck in the game.
[00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:22.160]   - Right, right.
[00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:24.320]   - You know, I'm not sure you can escape it.
[00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:26.720]   - You know, a couple of observations.
[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:28.160]   - Is that the positive take on it?
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:30.400]   - No, I know he wanted one.
[00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:31.360]   I apologize.
[00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:35.920]   - Well, I mean, I'll give you my spin on that.
[00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:41.040]   Number one is, you know, I do think that pensions and sovereign wealth funds
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:45.920]   have, you know, stepped in to replace some of the money
[00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:48.640]   that came out of the endowment ecosystem, right?
[00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:52.880]   Because endowments, you know, I think about the legends of that business
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:55.840]   who were allocating those dollars, you know,
[00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:59.920]   the Phil Rotners of the world or the Swensons of the world, right?
[00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:02.800]   Like they would phone up everybody on Sand Hill Road
[00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:04.480]   and they would say, "You're getting over your skis.
[00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:06.480]   You need to back it off a little bit," right?
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:08.160]   That industry is long gone.
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:12.400]   But I would also say, I just, you know, I saw news this morning,
[00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:16.240]   you know, at FII, which is doing, you know,
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:20.240]   like I think an incredible convening of investors and leaders
[00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:21.280]   from around the world.
[00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:24.000]   I think they're doing incredible stuff, you know,
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.560]   in the GCC and Saudi in particular.
[00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:30.320]   But they said, "We're going to deploy more of PIFS dollars
[00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:34.800]   on investments inside of Saudi Arabia than outside of Saudi Arabia," right?
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:39.760]   So I think there was like, and I've heard this as well from, you know, the UAE.
[00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:42.240]   They're going to consolidate the number of GPs.
[00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:46.000]   And so I think there is increasing focus coming out of sovereigns as well.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:46.720]   I hear the same.
[00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:49.760]   I was just down in Texas talking to the Texas pensions,
[00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:51.200]   the same thing happening there.
[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:54.400]   But when they consolidate, that probably means
[00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:57.920]   more dollars into fewer, right, platforms.
[00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:00.320]   So maybe it's starting to crack, but I don't know.
[00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:04.160]   And so I don't know, you know, we've seen from that slide that I showed,
[00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:07.600]   the total amount of funding has definitely come down
[00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:11.040]   by about 30 or 40% over the course of the last couple of years.
[00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:12.160]   So that's one half of it.
[00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:15.600]   The other half is there is no doubt that the outcomes
[00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:17.840]   that we're now talking about are much bigger
[00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:20.880]   than the outcomes we were talking about 10 or 20 years ago.
[00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:25.040]   So it would make sense to me, if you looked at a trend line for the industry,
[00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:27.600]   the industry and the number of dollars deployed
[00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:30.640]   and the size of funds should be much bigger today
[00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:33.120]   because companies are scaling much faster today
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:34.960]   and the outcomes are much faster.
[00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:39.200]   OpenAI got to, you know, $4.5 billion of revenue
[00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:42.160]   in a fraction of the time it took Google and Meta.
[00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:48.160]   And, you know, and so like that to me supports more dollars, larger funds.
[00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:51.200]   But I do think the law of economic gravity prevails.
[00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:54.640]   There's a certain fund size I think it can deploy
[00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:58.160]   if you're aiming for traditional venture like returns,
[00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:02.080]   then I don't think there are 100 growth companies, right,
[00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:05.440]   that you can go put in a fund of $5 or $10 billion,
[00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:09.920]   equally weight them and get a 4 to 5x over any reasonable period of time.
[00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:12.160]   And we can, I mean, let's move into that.
[00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:18.560]   I mean, I think the enthusiasm around AI is part of what led to that reality.
[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:24.000]   And if it didn't feel spectacular, it wouldn't have happened, right?
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:24.400]   Right.
[00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:28.720]   So it's tautological that those two things contribute to one another.
[00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:32.400]   Well, it's a, you know, so one of the topics we've been talking about all year is,
[00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:36.000]   you know, is AI and GPU scaling.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.840]   Will these AI models continue to scale?
[00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:40.640]   Will GPUs continue to scale?
[00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:44.800]   There was a lot of question whether or not NVIDIA would grow in 2025.
[00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:46.880]   But just this week, we saw a few announcements.
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:51.120]   First, we saw out of XAI, the Colossus cluster in Memphis,
[00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:54.000]   which I discussed at length with Jensen.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.160]   They announced this week that they're scaling.
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:39:04.560]   Elon said, we're now going to go from 100,000 GPUs to 200,000 GPUs in that facility.
[00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:07.920]   Did you see the video that Supermicro put out on this?
[00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:09.280]   No, you told me about it though.
[00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:09.520]   Right.
[00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:11.120]   So it's-
[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:11.760]   Describe it.
[00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:14.000]   Or you put a link in.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.480]   It's incredible to watch what they built.
[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:17.200]   Yeah.
[00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:23.440]   And if I think about for the last decade, data center engineering and construction
[00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:26.320]   has been in the background, right?
[00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:28.560]   Like, you know, Meta had breakthroughs.
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:29.840]   Google had breakthroughs.
[00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:34.880]   Like we'd talk about it, but it wasn't something that people were posting videos on.
[00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:38.960]   I think there's some Equinox shareholders that might disagree with you.
[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:42.560]   But I would say we generally took it for granted.
[00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:48.160]   But now it's clearly becoming a much more important source of competitive advantage.
[00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:54.160]   And I would just say, you know, it's super impressive what they pulled off in Memphis.
[00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:58.800]   It all gets to this question of, you know, you were asking at the beginning of the year,
[00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:02.720]   will we need or will we get to clusters of 200,000?
[00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:05.520]   Now those questions are clearly off the table.
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:08.880]   And so we have all these mega caps reporting this week.
[00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:16.480]   It's expected that CapEx will continue to, you know, continue on at this $250 billion run rate.
[00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:22.720]   Google came in tonight at $13 billion, just above the $12.7 billion that was expected.
[00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:25.920]   So they revised that higher a bit.
[00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:31.440]   Bill, what do you just make out of, you know, as we sit here toward the end of 2024,
[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:38.000]   do you expect that this is going to, you know, continue at this pace?
[00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:45.120]   Is this a sort of, you know, I've heard people describe it as a Pascal's bet sort of situation?
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:49.440]   You know, how are you thinking about, you know, where this all leads?
[00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:53.680]   I'd love to drill down on that, but let's come to it in a bit.
[00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:57.040]   Look, it's something we've never seen before.
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:41:01.840]   You know, if I think back to, and you and I were discussing this,
[00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:09.600]   but if I think back to the breakout companies of the previous generation of VC backed companies,
[00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:12.640]   none of them had massive CapEx.
[00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:18.960]   The biggest one was Amazon, actually, with their distribution facilities.
[00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:22.320]   And it caused a lot of skepticism.
[00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:26.640]   And they raised a lot of debt, and they did things other people hadn't done before.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:29.440]   And, you know, I've discussed it.
[00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:33.760]   I don't think we've ever seen kind of a CapEx race before.
[00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:41.360]   And it's pretty mind boggling that these are being built at this scale.
[00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:47.200]   It's interesting, you know, to try and count how many people are going to want to do it.
[00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:50.560]   Like, you know, the hyperscares obviously are reselling this.
[00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:54.400]   So, they're like an arms merchant to everyone else.
[00:41:54.400 --> 00:42:00.240]   You know, in Tesla's case, and extended AI's case, and Meta's case,
[00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:04.400]   they're consuming this, you know, for their own good.
[00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:08.400]   And, you know, I'd throw this back at you.
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:13.840]   Do you think there'll eventually be 50 of those that are Tesla-like,
[00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:17.040]   that will want to build these out for themselves?
[00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:20.960]   No, I think there are going to be a handful of companies, you know, like take Mag7.
[00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:22.880]   Because the scale is too high.
[00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:25.360]   Yeah, think about it this way.
[00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:28.080]   You know, if you look at Google, in the quarter,
[00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:34.720]   GCP has accelerated its revenues by up to plus 35% year on year, okay?
[00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:36.480]   So, just to put that in perspective,
[00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:39.920]   they added about two and a half billion of new ARR in the quarter.
[00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:44.320]   That's like adding a Databricks in the quarter, right?
[00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:50.480]   So, it's only companies of that scale that can afford to spend $50 billion a year.
[00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:54.240]   And, you know, I do think there are increasing advantages to scale,
[00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:56.720]   both when it comes to data and compute.
[00:42:56.720 --> 00:43:02.000]   And so, you know, I found this Pascal's bet to be a good framing of this,
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.120]   which is, if I were running any one of those companies,
[00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:07.360]   it would now be sufficiently clear to me.
[00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:09.120]   Explain, explain this, Pascal.
[00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:11.120]   You know, so Pascal's this French philosopher.
[00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:13.440]   He says, I don't know whether God exists or not,
[00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:16.240]   but if he does exist and I don't believe,
[00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:18.640]   then it's going to be a really bad outcome for me.
[00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:21.440]   And if he does exist, I do believe I have eternal life.
[00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:26.960]   So, if you believe that the upside of AI, right, is infinite, is eternal,
[00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:32.000]   right, is some really big outcome and all your competitors are doing it,
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:33.840]   what else are you going to invest your money in?
[00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:38.480]   We said here several weeks ago, you can buy back your shares,
[00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:41.920]   you can issue a dividend, or you can buy GPUs, right?
[00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:44.800]   Do you think any one of these founders or any of these companies-
[00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:47.360]   You can do licensed deals with companies you want to acquire.
[00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:55.200]   You know, so I think, but I think most of these people are in this game for this moment,
[00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:59.680]   but I think it raises a really interesting alternative question,
[00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:05.680]   which is, it's pretty clear to me now that there are very few new entrants
[00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:09.120]   that are going to be able to play in that game, right?
[00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:12.720]   You may be able to build an application that rides on those rails,
[00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:17.040]   but the idea that you're going to be able to build that level of compute
[00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:21.360]   or build a frontier model that's going to require that level of compute
[00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:24.160]   on an annual basis and compete with those companies,
[00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:25.840]   I think it's very, very difficult.
[00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:29.440]   Yeah, and another thing that I think the law of large numbers
[00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:31.280]   just starts to catch up as well.
[00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:35.520]   I think there's some CapEx spend from even a Mag7.
[00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:40.240]   I'd mentioned that maybe the CFO's voice goes up a little bit,
[00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:43.680]   but the investors will start asking as well.
[00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:47.280]   And there was another data point this week that may seem trivial,
[00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:50.960]   but there was something that just came out yesterday
[00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:54.880]   that OpenAI is talking to TSMC about building a chip
[00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:57.520]   and has put their foundry ambitions on hold.
[00:44:57.520 --> 00:44:59.280]   Right.
[00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:02.560]   I always thought the foundry ambitions were a little too ambitious,
[00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:05.680]   but in some ways, that's an odd recognition that,
[00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:08.320]   oh, well, that may have been too much money.
[00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:11.120]   And with the burn rate that's rumored that they have,
[00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:13.360]   like, oh, okay, maybe, you know.
[00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:15.520]   And so, there is some...
[00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:18.560]   One thing I would say about the Pascal thing
[00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:22.800]   is if that's truly what's on everyone's mind,
[00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:25.680]   that's exactly how you would go over the top.
[00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:26.720]   Right, for sure.
[00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:27.760]   The exact formula.
[00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:31.440]   First, I mean, listen, there is some non-zero probability.
[00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:34.480]   Just as Elon says, there's a non-zero probability
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:37.680]   that AI is going to end up being bad for humanity.
[00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:39.920]   There is a non-zero probability here
[00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:42.400]   that at least for some of the players,
[00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:44.480]   they don't see a return on that investment.
[00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:47.600]   Or that you get a supply-demand imbalance in the middle.
[00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:51.600]   Or you get a diluted return, right, that you all overspend.
[00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:55.280]   And had you just waited and spent slower,
[00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:57.360]   the cost of the technology would come down.
[00:45:57.360 --> 00:45:58.400]   It would cost you less over time.
[00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:02.720]   I mean, look, there are people that will argue that the,
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:05.360]   you know, we're going to get in here
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:07.600]   and the first pass is we're going to place
[00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:08.960]   a bunch of programmers.
[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:11.440]   But then we're going to replace a bunch of paralegals.
[00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:13.600]   And then we're going to replace, you know,
[00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:17.920]   a bunch of, you know, imaging analysts.
[00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:21.760]   And then, you know, and the longer that list gets,
[00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:26.800]   and if you are successfully fine-tuning models
[00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:29.840]   specifically for those particular tasks,
[00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:33.200]   and that gets longer and longer and longer,
[00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:36.240]   that's big, I mean.
[00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:38.560]   So it leads me perfectly into this comment
[00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:41.840]   out of Masa Sun today, you know,
[00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:43.920]   that we couldn't not talk about.
[00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:46.880]   But at any rate, Masa at FII today said,
[00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:53.600]   "9 trillion of cumulative CapEx on 200 million GPUs
[00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:55.280]   is very reasonable."
[00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:58.240]   He said, "In fact, I think it may be too small."
[00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:00.400]   And he went on to say, you know,
[00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:04.960]   that if you took the most critical estimate,
[00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:08.000]   so of the value of AI.
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.960]   So he said the lowest estimate that he's seen
[00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:14.880]   on the value of AI is that it could do the, you know,
[00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:17.200]   what he calls artificial super intelligence,
[00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:18.880]   which is what he thinks we'll have
[00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:20.160]   if we spend $9 trillion,
[00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:25.600]   is that it would replace 5% of the global workforce.
[00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:27.760]   And it just so happens, if you do the math on that,
[00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:31.200]   5% of the global workforce costs about $9 trillion a year.
[00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:33.920]   So he said, "Imagine you were a single entity,
[00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:37.600]   single enterprise, the global workforce was your workforce,
[00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:40.320]   and you could spend 9 trillion cumulatively
[00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:42.000]   over the next seven years,
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.880]   that you would then recoup in a single year
[00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:46.800]   through the efficiencies gained in that workforce,
[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:50.240]   it would obviously be an NPV positive investment."
[00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:54.240]   Bill, is Masa's 9 trillion the top?
[00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:57.120]   Is it where all this, you know?
[00:47:57.120 --> 00:48:00.480]   I think the key math for that number
[00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:03.760]   is that it was bigger than any number anyone else has said.
[00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:05.120]   There you go, there you go.
[00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:06.720]   I do think though there's, I mean,
[00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:08.160]   many have made this argument, right?
[00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:09.680]   You look at IT budgets as a whole,
[00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:12.560]   about half of that generally goes to headcount and people,
[00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:14.720]   a smaller percentage of that goes to software,
[00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:16.240]   and even smaller percentage of that
[00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:18.400]   goes to new spend in the year.
[00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:21.040]   Most of the software spend is just renewal.
[00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:22.880]   You spent it last year, you're gonna spend it this year.
[00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:25.200]   A lot of people have written about this,
[00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:27.600]   but it's the great services to software rotation.
[00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:30.560]   Services markets are usually 10x bigger than software markets.
[00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:35.360]   If we look at how can spend attack IT budgets as a whole,
[00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:37.920]   it's not just let's replace this software spend
[00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:38.960]   with this software spend,
[00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:41.280]   it's let's replace these call center agents.
[00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:43.680]   Let's replace these insurance people
[00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:45.360]   filling out forms in the back office.
[00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:47.520]   It's let's replace a lot of this headcount spend.
[00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:49.280]   I mean, most of these firms replace,
[00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:53.760]   you know, employ hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people,
[00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:55.120]   and we're seeing those numbers.
[00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:56.560]   That's where, you know, I started,
[00:48:56.560 --> 00:49:00.960]   you know, the conversation about my walk with Michael.
[00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:04.320]   And, you know, again, this is looking over
[00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:06.320]   a 30 to 40 year period of time,
[00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:11.040]   never has he seen, or have I seen,
[00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:15.120]   the ability for companies to take out 10,000 people
[00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:19.840]   and actually see customer satisfaction scores increase, right?
[00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:23.120]   There's always a cost to letting people go.
[00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:26.240]   But in this case, you know, you hear Zuckerberg talk
[00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:28.560]   about take out 20,000 people.
[00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:30.640]   Flatter is faster, leaner is better.
[00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:32.960]   We're getting more done with less, right?
[00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:36.320]   When you look at span of control in companies, right?
[00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:38.720]   There are some companies, you know, that still have,
[00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:42.160]   and that's the number of employees per manager, right?
[00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:45.200]   So you can imagine that will widen, you know,
[00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:48.800]   because AI will allow you to, you know, have more people,
[00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:51.600]   you know, who you can effectively manage.
[00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:54.880]   - It'll be interesting, I do think that some
[00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:58.960]   of the fine tuning of the math is still to come.
[00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:01.280]   And I'll use the coding example.
[00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:03.280]   You know, when we started, you know,
[00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:05.600]   oh, we're gonna replace engineers.
[00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:10.480]   But if you talk to someone, a CIO type,
[00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:12.240]   and say, what kind of lift do you get
[00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:14.080]   from a co-pilot product?
[00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:17.280]   They're kind of generally in the 15 to 30% range,
[00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:20.160]   which isn't, you know, if you're replacing somebody,
[00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:23.360]   it's 100% or infinite percent.
[00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:28.560]   And so whether or not, and maybe customer service
[00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:30.960]   is different than coding in this case,
[00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:36.080]   where you can, you know, replace 100% or 90% of the people.
[00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:39.440]   But it'd be interesting to see as the analysis come out
[00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:42.800]   of these things, what those different numbers look like
[00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:44.560]   for each of these different verticals,
[00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:47.360]   so that you can get a better sense of that.
[00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:51.360]   But if you really can, you know,
[00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:54.160]   if Sierra, Brett Taylor's company is right,
[00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:58.800]   and you can replace 100% of your customer service agents
[00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:02.320]   with this technology and get a more satisfied customer,
[00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:05.760]   and if there are multiple verticals like that,
[00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:09.280]   then you're right, this could go on for a long, long time.
[00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:13.760]   - I'd say, you know, there's no doubt in my mind
[00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:16.320]   that there's some sloppy spending going on, right?
[00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:20.160]   Like, you can't add this magnitude of spending
[00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:23.200]   without there being a little bit of waste, okay?
[00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:26.880]   But it's also clear to me that the reward on the other side,
[00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:30.240]   there is nobody taking their foot off the accelerator.
[00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:31.040]   - Yeah. - Right?
[00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:33.520]   When I talk to CoreWeave, when I talk to Azure,
[00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:37.120]   when I talk to OpenAI, when I talk to Amazon, Google, et cetera,
[00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:41.360]   not one of them is talking about anything other than
[00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:45.440]   how do we find the facilities that can support a gigawatt
[00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:48.240]   or two gigawatts or three gigawatts of power
[00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:51.680]   to power up the clusters that they wanna invest in.
[00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:55.520]   And remember, these are three, four, five-year-long investments.
[00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:57.760]   - Another thing that came out this morning
[00:51:57.760 --> 00:52:00.160]   that I was kind of waiting on as a proof point,
[00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:02.640]   'cause it didn't make sense to me that it hadn't happened yet,
[00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:08.240]   TSMC said they're gonna do across the board 20% price increase.
[00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:10.720]   And that's, I was like, this should be happening.
[00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:11.760]   - Right. - And so seeing that
[00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:14.000]   is also indicative of this, right?
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:15.760]   - Indeed, indeed.
[00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:19.120]   And maybe we could close out here
[00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:21.840]   by talking about the markets a little bit.
[00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:23.760]   We always talk about the markets at the close.
[00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:26.720]   But one of the questions I keep getting asked, Bill,
[00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:29.360]   is whether or not this election is priced in.
[00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:34.240]   I mean, in a lot of our text threads we have with our friends,
[00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:36.240]   everybody's trying to figure this out,
[00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:39.280]   all eyes on the election, which is here in seven or eight days.
[00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:41.600]   And the question is like,
[00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:44.880]   a lot of people looking at the prediction markets
[00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:48.320]   saying increased probability that Trump wins the election.
[00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:50.720]   So they're wondering, is there still time for me
[00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:53.680]   to adjust my portfolio, right, ahead of this?
[00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:57.760]   And so you heard Druckenmiller talk about this this week.
[00:52:57.760 --> 00:52:59.600]   Paul Tudor Jones talked about it.
[00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:04.000]   I think Ray Dalio all said the market is fully banking
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:06.320]   on a Trump victory at this point in time.
[00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:10.240]   I probably wouldn't put the market is at 100%,
[00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:13.280]   but, you know, there's 70 to 80% baked into the cake.
[00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:15.920]   You can see that a lot of stocks have moved a lot.
[00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:17.520]   And I peeled this back a little bit.
[00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:18.400]   - This is unbelievable.
[00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:21.600]   I'd love to see what's in this democratic spread trade bucket.
[00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:24.320]   It's down 20%, 30 days.
[00:53:24.320 --> 00:53:26.400]   - Well, I'll tell you, you know, I looked at it,
[00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:28.880]   you know, some companies in the solar complex,
[00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:30.960]   like Enphase, et cetera, down 25%.
[00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:33.040]   Companies- - In 30 days.
[00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:34.400]   - In 30 days.
[00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:37.520]   You know, companies like in the healthcare trade,
[00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:41.360]   Humana and others down significantly
[00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:44.080]   because obviously they provide Medicare Advantage
[00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:46.720]   and other products that will get hurt,
[00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:50.160]   that are expected to get hurt under a Trump presidency.
[00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:53.680]   And so if you look at the policy consequences
[00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:57.200]   of these two candidates, they're very stark, right?
[00:53:57.200 --> 00:53:59.520]   And I would argue that most- - He's also talked about
[00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:03.680]   an MFN clause for drug prices inside versus outside of US.
[00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:05.840]   - So at this point, would I sit here
[00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:08.320]   and I try to fine tune my portfolio for the election?
[00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:08.880]   Probably not.
[00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:12.720]   You know, I think that markets have been quite efficient
[00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:15.360]   on this over the last 30 days.
[00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:20.240]   And my own sense is that the bigger surprise, right?
[00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:23.920]   If you thought that it wasn't 60 or 70% likelihood
[00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:25.120]   that Trump was going to win,
[00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:27.760]   let's say you thought it was actually even odds
[00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:30.880]   and you believe the polls that are out there, right?
[00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:34.240]   That whole trade there will unwind if Harris wins.
[00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:37.760]   So there would be a massive move in the other direction,
[00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:39.680]   right, if Harris were to win.
[00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:41.760]   I put both of them in the too hard bucket,
[00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:43.200]   but I thought I'd put them out there
[00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:46.880]   because we get certainly a lot of chatter about it.
[00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:50.240]   - All right, we're in the earning season, Brad.
[00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:53.120]   So, and we had a couple,
[00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:55.040]   like right before we just started today,
[00:54:55.040 --> 00:54:56.640]   I guess Google and AMD,
[00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:01.520]   what's your quick interpretation of what you're seeing
[00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:02.400]   and what do you expect?
[00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:04.560]   - Well, I think we came into this week,
[00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:07.200]   we and lots of others,
[00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:09.360]   like if you look over the course of the past several weeks,
[00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:14.320]   the Mag 5 has underperformed software and other categories.
[00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:16.080]   And I think people are pretty concerned
[00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:17.600]   about the CapEx guides.
[00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:19.280]   There's been a lot of talk about that.
[00:55:19.280 --> 00:55:22.240]   I came into this week and said to my team,
[00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:24.880]   I think it's largely priced in at this point in time.
[00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:26.560]   I said, I thought the whole Mag 5
[00:55:26.560 --> 00:55:29.520]   would probably trade up three to 5% this week,
[00:55:29.520 --> 00:55:30.480]   including Google.
[00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:31.680]   Google came out tonight,
[00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:35.440]   they grew their search revenues by 12%.
[00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:38.960]   They grew YouTube revenues by 12%.
[00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:42.560]   The stock's up, I think, four or 5% after hours.
[00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:44.160]   That all smells right to me.
[00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:48.000]   It had traded off a lot going into this period.
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:50.320]   I think the more interesting thing, Bill,
[00:55:50.320 --> 00:55:51.600]   is if you look at kind of--
[00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:53.600]   - Hey, can I ask you just a quick follow-up.
[00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:56.080]   When you said they were worried about the CapEx guide,
[00:55:56.080 --> 00:55:57.360]   which way were they worried?
[00:55:57.360 --> 00:55:59.920]   - They were worried that it was gonna be even higher.
[00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:01.040]   - Yeah. - Okay, so--
[00:56:01.040 --> 00:56:03.040]   - But from your analysis earlier,
[00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:04.720]   it's a good thing if they wanna spend more.
[00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:08.800]   - Well, no, I think that there is,
[00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:12.480]   I mean, remember, these CapEx expenses
[00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:15.280]   have gone fairly parabolic in the last couple of years.
[00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:19.040]   - Yeah. - But operating income,
[00:56:19.040 --> 00:56:21.920]   so margin expansion and top-line growth
[00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:24.800]   have outpaced the increase in CapEx.
[00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:26.560]   So people have tolerated it.
[00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:28.640]   What won't work well, right?
[00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:30.960]   Let's say we had a recession next year,
[00:56:30.960 --> 00:56:35.120]   and then earnings came in a lot lower than people expected,
[00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:37.120]   or top-line growth came in lower,
[00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:40.720]   but you were unhinged on CapEx.
[00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:43.040]   I don't think that would be a particularly good equation
[00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:43.760]   for the stock.
[00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:47.040]   So some people were quite worried about this.
[00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:52.800]   But I think, let's talk about Google in particular, right?
[00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:55.360]   I think there's a lot of concern and chatter in the world.
[00:56:55.360 --> 00:56:57.200]   I've been out there talking about it.
[00:56:57.200 --> 00:57:01.360]   Chat GPT has consumed an extraordinary percentage
[00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:04.720]   of the time and energy that I used to spend in search.
[00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:07.520]   So it's kind of hard to believe
[00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:10.080]   that it's not really having an impact on search revenues,
[00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:11.200]   but it's not.
[00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:12.560]   And so if you look at this chart
[00:57:12.560 --> 00:57:14.880]   that shows the search revenue growth
[00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:16.400]   over the course of the last eight quarters,
[00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:19.200]   I mean, they've accelerated search revenue growth
[00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:24.000]   from end of '22 and early '23,
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:27.360]   from 2%, 5%, all the way up to 14%,
[00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:29.520]   still at 12% today.
[00:57:29.520 --> 00:57:31.760]   So part of the question is,
[00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:34.640]   how long can search revenue growth stay at this level?
[00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:36.480]   And one of the key questions there
[00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:41.040]   was whether or not the AI-enhanced search results
[00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:43.920]   were going to monetize at the same level
[00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:46.000]   as non-AI-enhanced search results.
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:47.520]   So they call these SGE.
[00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:53.120]   And it turns out that they said on the call tonight
[00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:55.120]   that they're monetizing at the same level.
[00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:59.760]   So that's a really good data point for Google, if true,
[00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:03.440]   which is they can layer in the answer at the top,
[00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:06.000]   push the blue links down the page
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:07.440]   without losing a lot of revenue.
[00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:11.280]   Although, I mean, this has been argued
[00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:12.800]   both as a positive and negative,
[00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:15.920]   but the searches that were, I guess,
[00:58:15.920 --> 00:58:18.320]   stolen most quickly by a chat engine
[00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:21.680]   are more of these kind of encyclopedic-type searches
[00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:23.360]   where you're looking for information,
[00:58:23.360 --> 00:58:27.040]   whereas the big money searches for Google
[00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:30.320]   are travel and new car and a home
[00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:32.640]   and those kind of things, big purchases.
[00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:35.440]   And so those may not, in fact, be the ones
[00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:37.120]   where they're inserting much of this.
[00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:41.760]   So you may be talking about the long tail
[00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:43.600]   of their searches anyway
[00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:46.240]   that aren't that relevant to the big dollars.
[00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:46.800]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:48.320]   I don't know, for sure.
[00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:49.680]   I mean, a lot of people think of these
[00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:51.120]   as the knowledge graph searches.
[00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:53.200]   You know, I've been using, you know,
[00:58:53.200 --> 00:58:55.120]   all last night I was using ChatGPT
[00:58:55.120 --> 00:58:59.200]   to help Lincoln study for his AP History exam.
[00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:01.040]   There's not a lot of monetization of that
[00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:01.600]   in Google anyway.
[00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:03.280]   So that page could be the same.
[00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:06.560]   Right, so that monetization is about the same.
[00:59:06.560 --> 00:59:09.200]   Now, we've also, as you know,
[00:59:09.200 --> 00:59:12.480]   we saw this week that Anthropic released computer use,
[00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:14.880]   to take control of my browser,
[00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:17.680]   to, you know, what we've been discussing,
[00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:20.320]   book that hotel or book that airline ticket.
[00:59:20.320 --> 00:59:23.840]   It's kludgy, you know, a lot of people, you know,
[00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:25.520]   but it's a step in the direction.
[00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:26.720]   A lot of people thought that Google
[00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:28.480]   was going to release Jarvis this week,
[00:59:28.480 --> 00:59:30.160]   which is their version of this.
[00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:32.160]   Someone just funded a new browser company,
[00:59:32.160 --> 00:59:33.120]   Kleiner did, I think.
[00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:35.200]   OpenAI will certainly do this.
[00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:36.160]   For the agentic browser.
[00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:38.560]   So, you know, the fact of the matter is,
[00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:40.080]   Google is already discounting this.
[00:59:40.080 --> 00:59:41.680]   It's trading at the lowest multiple,
[00:59:41.680 --> 00:59:43.520]   you know, in the mag five.
[00:59:43.520 --> 00:59:45.760]   So I think people are saying at some point,
[00:59:45.760 --> 00:59:47.040]   it's going to have some effect.
[00:59:47.040 --> 00:59:48.720]   We don't know exactly when,
[00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:50.160]   but I would just say for this quarter,
[00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:53.120]   you know, super solid quarter out of the company.
[00:59:53.120 --> 00:59:54.400]   And then you asked about AMD.
[00:59:54.400 --> 00:59:57.280]   AMD's down about 10% after hours,
[00:59:57.280 --> 01:00:00.480]   despite, you know, continuing to have blistering growth.
[01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:02.640]   And I think what's going on there is,
[01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:04.800]   there was some talk at the beginning of the year,
[01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:10.560]   that AMD could capture maybe 10% of the data center market.
[01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:11.920]   And the fact of the matter is,
[01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:14.560]   when they gave some forward guidance tonight,
[01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:17.120]   that suggests they're going to stay at about 3%
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:21.200]   of the GPU kind of data center market,
[01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:23.680]   relative to NVIDIA at about 90%.
[01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:26.640]   The company's done extraordinarily well.
[01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:29.280]   Lisa is an amazing, you know, CEO.
[01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:31.920]   And I think there are a lot of good things in the works,
[01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:34.560]   but, you know, they're not closing the gap
[01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:36.160]   in terms of share of market.
[01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:38.320]   The tide is rising for both parties,
[01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:40.240]   but the opportunity clearly for them.
[01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:41.680]   - And it's off big now.
[01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:47.120]   - Right, is to try to pierce a larger share of that market,
[01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:49.440]   but we didn't see any move forward.
[01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:51.200]   - You know, back on the Google thing real quick,
[01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:55.840]   I just have a really hard time, like in my brain,
[01:00:55.840 --> 01:01:00.000]   separating kind of my own user experience shift
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.400]   and how fewer Google searches I do,
[01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:05.600]   to accepting the idea that,
[01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:07.600]   oh, well, they're going to add it in too.
[01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:10.800]   Like, I don't go back there and say,
[01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:13.040]   oh, this is better, like with it added in
[01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:14.240]   and the ads and stuff.
[01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:15.840]   I prefer the--
[01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:16.800]   - Perplexity or--
[01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:18.960]   - Perplexity or chat GPT, I really do.
[01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:20.880]   So I don't feel--
[01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:23.840]   - Right, and so that to me is the leading edge, right?
[01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:25.200]   Like at the end of the day,
[01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:27.840]   could Google give you that same clean experience
[01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:29.040]   that chat GPT gives you?
[01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:30.720]   Of course they could, right?
[01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:34.000]   But they cannibalize, that's what innovator's dilemma means.
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.640]   They cannibalize their core business.
[01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:39.360]   And so they either have to, you know,
[01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:40.960]   have a product that looks different,
[01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:42.320]   that still has the blue links,
[01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:44.720]   that still has the sponsored ads, right?
[01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:48.560]   And you risk losing user affinity, right?
[01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:50.480]   Or, you know, so to me it's--
[01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:51.840]   - Well, they have this other challenge
[01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:54.560]   that I think is hard for people to understand,
[01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:56.080]   but I've explained it a couple of times,
[01:01:56.080 --> 01:02:01.120]   which is their revenue per visit is going to fall
[01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:02.880]   if they complete the transaction.
[01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:06.800]   Because someone is spending marketing dollars
[01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:08.880]   to take that customer to their website
[01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:11.600]   and run the transaction with the hopes
[01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:14.000]   that they'll come directly back to that website.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:18.000]   So they'll spend 50 to 100% of first transaction.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.120]   There's no one that's gonna,
[01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:26.000]   if Google or chat GPT or whoever convinces Kayak or whoever
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:30.480]   to be a white label rails in the background,
[01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:32.560]   the amount of money they're gonna give you for that,
[01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:35.760]   it's gonna be like 5% of the transaction.
[01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:37.600]   - Bill, you brought something interesting.
[01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:38.800]   So like this new browser, right?
[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:40.320]   It's company called Browserbase.
[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:42.960]   And I think this is a really interesting concept
[01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:45.120]   to think about kind of transitionary states
[01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:46.400]   versus end states, right?
[01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:48.560]   The transitionary state today
[01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:49.600]   is we're gonna have agents
[01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:52.000]   that essentially can scrape websites
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.240]   and view it as if I'm doing it.
[01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:56.160]   They're gonna recognize the button and click the button.
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:56.880]   They're gonna go here.
[01:02:56.880 --> 01:02:59.600]   What if we reinvented the browser
[01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:00.720]   and built it in a way
[01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:02.640]   where it's not a button for a human eye,
[01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:05.360]   but everything is some composable API
[01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:06.960]   that an agent can recognize
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:08.320]   and an agent can go interact with.
[01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:10.880]   And so you're not scraping the website
[01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:12.720]   where you would lose the eyeballs.
[01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:16.560]   You're building a new browser for agents versus humans.
[01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:17.440]   Is that the end state?
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:18.640]   There's lots, I don't know the answer,
[01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:20.360]   but it's an interesting question.
[01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:22.400]   - You have to rebuild all the rails too.
[01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:25.760]   I mean, everything has to start to look like Stripe.
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:28.640]   There has to be a travel Stripe.
[01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:34.400]   There has to be, like you need a transactional network
[01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:36.640]   and that's not what we have today.
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:42.240]   Like we have this browser-based world
[01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:45.760]   that sits between the consumer and all these businesses.
[01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:47.840]   But it could happen.
[01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:49.360]   And boy, we've talked about voice.
[01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:51.760]   Like if you just start talking to your computer,
[01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:54.080]   it's a very different world.
[01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:56.880]   That's not a browser or it's not the browser we know.
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:00.400]   We'll be a different entity.
[01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:00.800]   - Yeah.
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:03.520]   - Well, I think the way you go over the top
[01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:06.800]   and why I'm so excited
[01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:10.480]   about the equivalent of computer use across the board
[01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:13.360]   is in the same reason perhaps that Elon says
[01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:17.360]   you use a humanoid versus a non-humanoid robotic form
[01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:20.000]   because a humanoid works in a world
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.080]   that was designed for humans, right?
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:23.600]   And the thing about computer use,
[01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:26.400]   you don't have to build all these new rails and everything,
[01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:29.760]   which takes a really long time to negotiate all of that stuff.
[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:32.400]   Instead, you just give it ubiquitous use
[01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:37.280]   of the world that already exists straight out of the gate.
[01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:42.160]   - I think this is something I really wanted to make a point on.
[01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:43.600]   I think it's gonna be super interesting
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:45.600]   to watch which categories
[01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:49.760]   and which verticals fall into place first and why.
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:52.000]   There was an article out this week
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:56.160]   that was looking at, I think, open AI as a scribe.
[01:04:56.160 --> 01:05:00.000]   And they highlighted that it failed a lot.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:05.680]   And this is also an issue with self-driving.
[01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:12.080]   If the cost of a 5% error or a 10% error is super high,
[01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:15.200]   it's gonna take AI a long time to get there.
[01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:16.880]   I would argue programming's that way.
[01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:18.800]   You can't have 5% or 10%--
[01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:19.760]   - Self-driving cars.
[01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:20.000]   - Wrong.
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:20.480]   Self-driving cars.
[01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:21.440]   - The error rate is death.
[01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:25.360]   - It may turn out that customer service, that's just fine
[01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:29.600]   because the best in class today already has that error rate
[01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:32.080]   just because of human failure.
[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:36.560]   And so it will take AI a while to get
[01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:39.840]   to where it has the kind of nines you need
[01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:41.760]   to solve certain problems.
[01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:44.480]   And that's why I'm so intrigued by which verticals
[01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:46.640]   are gonna line up first and get knocked over.
[01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:50.000]   - Well, another good conversation, Jamin.
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:50.480]   Great blog.
[01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:51.040]   - Thanks for joining us.
[01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:52.120]   - Thanks for having me.
[01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:57.560]   - Great blog and I imagine we're gonna get a lot of feedback
[01:05:57.560 --> 01:05:59.320]   on this one from LPs and founders.
[01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:02.040]   So we'll make sure to put it in the notes.
[01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:02.760]   Great to see you both.
[01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:03.240]   Thanks for being here.
[01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:03.880]   - Good to see you.
[01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:04.280]   Take care.
[01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:14.600]   (upbeat music)
[01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:16.280]   - As a reminder to everybody,
[01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:18.280]   just our opinions, not investment advice.
