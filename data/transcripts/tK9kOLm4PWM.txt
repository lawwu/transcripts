[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.040]   - And welcome back to the Ask Pastor John podcast,
[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.640]   especially if this is your first time here, welcome.
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.240]   I'm Tony, the host, and I pitch questions
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.100]   to longtime pastor and author, John Piper, that's his name.
[00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.120]   And we talk about life's most challenging questions
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.320]   and what the Bible has to say
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.940]   about those challenging questions.
[00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.440]   And maybe you just happened to see this episode online
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.120]   or maybe someone sent you this link, a friend or someone.
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.640]   Welcome.
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.160]   We do all this by taking questions from our audience.
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.960]   And today's question comes from a listener named Rebecca.
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.140]   Hello, Pastor John, and thank you for this podcast.
[00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.800]   It has blessed me, guided me,
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.580]   and strengthened my faith over the years.
[00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.520]   My question for you is this,
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.320]   how would you explain your experience of joy in God
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.940]   to a curious, unchurched non-Christian?
[00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.280]   Where would you begin?
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.960]   And how would you do it with language
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.920]   a non-Christian could easily follow?
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.360]   - Okay, let's do it this way.
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.760]   I'll write a short letter
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.440]   to an imaginary unbeliever named Michael,
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.440]   who has almost no experience of church or religious language,
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.640]   and who has asked me this very question
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.360]   to tell him what it means when I say,
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.560]   I experience joy in God.
[00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.680]   So here we go.
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.780]   Dear Michael, let's just call him Michael.
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.360]   You asked me what I mean when I say,
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.520]   I experience joy in God.
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.800]   Thanks for asking.
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.800]   There are not many things, Michael,
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.020]   that I enjoy talking about more than what I value,
[00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.880]   what I treasure most.
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.380]   You already know that my experience of God
[00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.200]   is based on the Bible.
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.680]   I believe it is the word of God.
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.640]   I believe that if you read it,
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.360]   especially its portrayal of Jesus,
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.560]   you can hear the ring of truth,
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.560]   the self-authenticating reality of God breaking through.
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.080]   So the first thing to say
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.720]   is that when the Bible talks about our relationship with God,
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.260]   it rings with the language of pleasure.
[00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.720]   In other words, I'm not just responding to the Bible
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.520]   with my own peculiar personality.
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.160]   No, I've been told by the Bible,
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.000]   by God himself through the Bible,
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.520]   that I should experience God as my pleasure.
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.480]   It's what God demands, not just what I desire.
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.480]   God's word is lavish with pleasure language.
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.760]   So let me give you some examples
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.680]   so you can get the feel of what I mean.
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.720]   And you can ask me sometime later
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.320]   and I'll show you these places actually in the Bible itself
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.200]   so you can read them for yourself.
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.160]   I think that would be helpful.
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.160]   Psalm 16, 11, "In your presence, O God, is fullness of joy.
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:06.320]   At your right hand are pleasures forevermore."
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.760]   Psalm 19, 14, "Satisfy us in the morning
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.160]   with your steadfast love
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.160]   that we may rejoice and be glad all our days."
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.760]   Psalm 37, 4, "Delight yourself in the Lord
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.520]   and he will give you the desires of your heart."
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.840]   Psalm 32, 11, "Be glad in the Lord."
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.680]   Psalm 19, 10, "More to be desired are your words, O Lord,
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.400]   than gold, even much fine gold,
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.400]   sweeter also than honey and drippings from the honeycomb."
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.600]   Isaiah 52, verse 7, "How beautiful upon the mountains
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.600]   are the feet of him who brings good news of happiness."
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.760]   Philippians 4, "I have learned in whatever situation I am
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.760]   to be content through Christ who strengthens me."
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.200]   Philippians 4, just a little earlier in the chapter,
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.800]   "Rejoice in the Lord."
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.640]   And again, I say, rejoice.
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.480]   Isaiah 26, "You keep him in perfect peace, O Lord,
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.440]   because he trusts in you."
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.240]   Psalm 4, "You have put more joy in my heart
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.160]   than they have when their grain and wine abound."
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.120]   Psalm 63, "My soul thirsts for you, O Lord.
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.280]   Your steadfast love is better than life."
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.480]   So that's for starters, Michael.
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.240]   Scraping the surface of the Bible,
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:46.240]   peace, rejoicing, contentment, happiness,
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:52.040]   gladness, delight, satisfaction, pleasures,
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:58.540]   all of it sweeter than honey, all of it better than wine,
[00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.940]   all of it better than life itself,
[00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.260]   as full as it can be, as long as it can be.
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.360]   So now the question is, how do I experience God that way?
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.960]   How does John Piper do that?
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:20.040]   And the first thing to say is that God himself
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.120]   has taken out of the way
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.840]   the greatest obstacle to my happiness,
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:31.700]   namely my ugly, God-belittling sin,
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.860]   and his just and holy wrath and fury against it.
[00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.040]   He sent his son, Jesus Christ,
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.500]   into the world to die in my place.
[00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:49.460]   The Bible says that he became a curse for me.
[00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:56.900]   He condemned my sin in the death of his own son.
[00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.760]   And he did this for absolutely everyone, indiscriminately,
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.840]   who would believe in him.
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.020]   So when I receive Jesus Christ,
[00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:12.020]   when I take him, welcome him, embrace him as my savior
[00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:16.100]   and my Lord and the treasure of my life,
[00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:21.100]   God sees me as united to Jesus
[00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:25.080]   so that his death counts as my punishment
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:30.980]   and his righteousness counts as my right standing
[00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:36.740]   before God so that now there's no condemnation for me.
[00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:41.420]   I'm forgiven for everything, no guilt, no punishment,
[00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:46.420]   no hell, no fear, accepted, adopted,
[00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:51.640]   loved, befriended, embraced as a father running out
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.680]   to welcome a long lost son.
[00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.560]   That's the beginning.
[00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:01.060]   That's the foundation, Michael,
[00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:05.820]   of all my joy, everything great and beautiful
[00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:10.820]   and valuable and desirable and satisfying in God
[00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:14.500]   is no longer dangerous for me.
[00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:18.660]   It's like a mountain range of endless discovery
[00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:22.800]   of more and more beauty where I will never fall off a ledge
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:27.800]   and die, but go further up and further in forever and ever
[00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:32.000]   because God is infinite and I'm not.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   Michael, every day I read my Bible
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.300]   and in the Bible, God himself,
[00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:44.140]   through the words that he inspired, speaks to me
[00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:47.220]   and I speak back to him.
[00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:50.020]   This is a real conversation.
[00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:51.340]   I don't hear voices.
[00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:57.180]   I read his inspired word addressed to his people, to me.
[00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:01.980]   I hear the voice of God in his precious word
[00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:04.220]   and it is sweeter than honey.
[00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:09.780]   That's what the Bible calls fellowship with God.
[00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:14.540]   And every day as we enjoy this fellowship,
[00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:18.940]   he shows me glimpses of his greatness
[00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:22.300]   and his beauty and his worth.
[00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:27.300]   The very things that I was made for,
[00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:32.660]   I was made to see and enjoy God in his greatness,
[00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:35.100]   his beauty, his worth.
[00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:36.980]   And you know this is true, Michael.
[00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:38.740]   You, Michael, know this.
[00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:43.740]   You were made to see and enjoy greatness in beauty
[00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:47.020]   and worth and love.
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.920]   Everybody was.
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:54.760]   God is the sum of all greatness and all beauty
[00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:58.700]   and all value and worth and all love.
[00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:05.040]   And he lets us enjoy him through his word
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:08.600]   and through his world,
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:12.320]   which also reveals his beauty and greatness.
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:16.640]   And when I face the ugliness and the sin
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:20.040]   and the suffering and the disasters of the world,
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:25.960]   he reminds me of spectacular promises
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:29.840]   that I will one day be with him,
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:34.840]   free from all pain, all sin, all depression,
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:39.000]   all discouragement, all anxieties,
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   in a brand new, magnificent body.
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:50.200]   And with that hope that he renews every day in me
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.560]   through his word,
[00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:56.480]   he gives me strength to go out into the world
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:00.480]   and to try to be useful to people by doing good
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.760]   and pointing people to everlasting satisfaction in him,
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:07.000]   which is what I'm doing right now, I hope.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.600]   And even though I'm not perfect,
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:13.640]   Michael, you know that pretty well.
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:17.840]   Even though I'm not perfect, he helps me do that
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:22.840]   and he forgives me for my failures, my shortcomings.
[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:28.040]   And at the end of the day, my conscience is clean
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:33.480]   and oh, the sweetness and joy of a clear conscience.
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.640]   My conscience is clean
[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:40.640]   because there has been some measure of obedience
[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:45.440]   and because of his precious, precious forgiveness
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:49.600]   through Jesus that I can lay my head down at night
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:53.840]   on a pillow with peace and joy.
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:57.440]   You know that's what I want for you, Michael.
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:00.000]   That's why I'm writing this letter
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.200]   and I'm happy to talk anytime you want to
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:07.120]   to take it further, your friend, John.
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:10.560]   - Thank you for this letter, Pastor John.
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.080]   Doubt is a common struggle.
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.600]   Even among believers, it can be a common struggle
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.560]   and that's been a theme on the podcast recently.
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:17.880]   We just looked at it.
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:20.400]   Can I doubt God and have joy in him at the same time?
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:23.360]   That was APJ 1963.
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:26.040]   Just on July 31, we addressed that.
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.280]   And then the very next episode we looked at
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:31.960]   was fighting off the inner skeptic in our Bible reading.
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:34.320]   When we open the Bible, that inner skeptic speaks up
[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:36.800]   and makes us doubt or question what we read.
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:39.760]   That was APJ 1964 on August 3rd.
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:41.920]   So recent episodes in our feed.
[00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:44.720]   And if you're listening and you maybe even doubt
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.040]   the existence of God, that too is nothing
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:47.880]   out of the ordinary.
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:49.560]   We looked at that in a previous episode,
[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:52.720]   way back in APJ 48, way back.
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:56.080]   An old episode titled, "Do you ever doubt God's existence?"
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:58.640]   That was a question directed to you, Pastor John.
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:03.000]   Do you, Pastor John, ever doubt God's existence?
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.920]   You can find APJs 48, 1963, and 1964
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:09.440]   at askpastorjohn.com.
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:12.440]   Important and valuable episodes to check out.
