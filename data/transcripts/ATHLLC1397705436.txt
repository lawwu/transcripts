[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.840]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:04.960]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of "All The Hacks,"
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.960]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.180]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins,
[00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.420]   and I'm really excited for my conversation today
[00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.640]   with Stanford professor, Matt Abrahams,
[00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.220]   who has dedicated his career
[00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:17.480]   to help people excel at communicating,
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.980]   even when they've been put on the spot in public.
[00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.140]   And this episode is gonna be so applicable
[00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.240]   to everyone listening,
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.440]   because most of the conversations we all have in our lives
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.060]   are spontaneous,
[00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.600]   unless it's a planned speech or presentation.
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.940]   But even then, I find that a good part of it
[00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.440]   ends up being off the cuff.
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.980]   So we're gonna talk about the six-step process
[00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.580]   he developed for his latest book,
[00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.540]   "Think Faster, Talk Smarter,"
[00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.500]   which will help you do exactly that
[00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.280]   in almost any situation.
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.120]   I am so excited for this conversation,
[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.300]   so let's jump in right after this.
[00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.420]   Did you know that someone new gets impacted
[00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.180]   by identity theft every two seconds?
[00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.000]   It makes sense when there's so much
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.620]   of our personal information getting shared online
[00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.160]   without our consent.
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.920]   I found a listing for my dad
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.080]   on a site called Family Tree Now
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.220]   that had his name, age, address, phone number,
[00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.920]   email, past addresses, and the names of his relatives.
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.980]   And that was just one of the 69 listings
[00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.440]   that had his info.
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.600]   Fortunately, instead of spending hours
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.440]   finding all the sites with his info
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.560]   and submitting the request to take it down,
[00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.820]   I got it all done in minutes with Delete Me from Abine,
[00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.200]   and I am so excited to be partnering with them
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.160]   for this episode.
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.940]   Delete Me is an amazing service
[00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.240]   that will not just find and remove your personal information
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.000]   from over 500 data broker websites,
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.120]   but they'll continuously scan for new data that shows up
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.760]   and get that removed as well.
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.720]   On average, Delete Me finds and removes
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.080]   over 2,000 pieces of data for a customer
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.380]   in their first two years,
[00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.460]   and to date, they've removed over 35 million pieces of data
[00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.400]   for their customers.
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.960]   So if you wanna get your personal information removed
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.960]   from all these listings on the internet,
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.000]   go to allthehacks.com/deleteme
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.520]   and get 20% off a plan for you or your entire family.
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.520]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/deleteme.
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.280]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.320]   - Matt, thanks for being here.
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.120]   - I am really excited to have a conversation, Chris, thanks.
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.560]   - So there's probably a wide range of comfort levels
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.280]   with communication and public speaking
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.760]   amongst people listening right now,
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.200]   but I think there's a situation that you're familiar with
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.740]   that's tough for lots of people,
[00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:23.920]   and that's when they're put on the spot.
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.360]   So first off, I just wanna know,
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.720]   what do you think makes that kind of
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.480]   spontaneous conversational situation so tough,
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.840]   and why do you think handling it can become
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.080]   such a valuable skill for people to learn?
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.900]   - Well, you're right.
[00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.880]   Most of our communication, if you think about it,
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:37.920]   is in the moment.
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.640]   You know, it's very rare that it's all planned.
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.120]   It's the presentation, pitch, or meeting.
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.620]   A lot of what we do is in the moment,
[00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.340]   and I think it is most fraught with anxiety and concern
[00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.760]   because we have so many things
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.600]   conspiring against us at once.
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.720]   Time pressure, we wanna do it right,
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.120]   we have to adjust and adapt
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.400]   to what's happening in the moment.
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.520]   All of those things make these situations
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.360]   really, really hard for us.
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.680]   Yet, with some work,
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.200]   we can develop the skills that are needed.
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.820]   Just like any other skill,
[00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.800]   you can develop the skills to speak better in the moment.
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:09.680]   - You've written a book on this.
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.240]   I see it behind you in the video.
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.640]   Let's talk about these skills
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.840]   'cause I think you have a method
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.140]   for developing these skills.
[00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.560]   I would start through the method,
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.480]   but if you have anything else you wanna cover first,
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.320]   go for it.
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.200]   I'm curious how this can be overcome.
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.040]   - Absolutely.
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.800]   So, happy to walk through the steps.
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.120]   The first thing I wanna say, Chris,
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.440]   that I think is really important
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.960]   is that we can all learn to get better
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.420]   at spontaneous speaking.
[00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.740]   Many of us feel like,
[00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.480]   oh, that's just for those other people
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.040]   who have the gift of gab,
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.160]   they just know how to do it,
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.160]   or they're extreme extroverts and that's how it goes.
[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.040]   That's not true.
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.920]   Everybody can get better at speaking in the moment,
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.720]   be it answering questions, giving feedback,
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:45.680]   making small talk.
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:46.680]   We can learn to do it.
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.700]   I, over the past 10 years, have developed a methodology.
[00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.320]   It started as a need out of Stanford's Business School,
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:54.160]   where I teach.
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.400]   The deans came to me and said,
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.820]   "Our incredibly bright students
[00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.520]   are really struggling answering questions in the moment."
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.640]   So, when that professor says,
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:03.480]   "What do you think?"
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.880]   That dreaded cold call,
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:05.980]   they knew the answers,
[00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.320]   they just really couldn't give the answers well.
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.320]   And so, that's where I started this journey
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.560]   to identify this six-step methodology,
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.720]   which really divides into two categories,
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.720]   mindset and messaging.
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.280]   So, the four steps in mindset.
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.640]   First, start with anxiety.
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.120]   And I'm sure you and I will talk a bit
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.640]   about anxiety around speaking,
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.920]   because that's something that really, really bothers
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.520]   a lot of people, myself included.
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.440]   So, we have to learn to manage anxiety.
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.560]   Not overcome it, I don't think we ever can,
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.200]   but I do think we can learn to manage it.
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.120]   That's step one.
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.720]   Step two, many of us in these spontaneous speaking situations
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.660]   want to do it right.
[00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.640]   We wanna be perfect or give the best answer possible.
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.680]   And you know, Chris, I've been doing this a long time.
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.000]   There is no one right answer to anything.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.600]   You have to just find the best way to do it for you.
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.160]   So, there are better ways and worse ways,
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.440]   there is no one right way.
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.600]   Step three is about seeing these situations as opportunities.
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.160]   Many of us feel threatened.
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.240]   If I told you, Chris, right now,
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.080]   "Hey, guess what?
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.560]   When I'm done talking, I'm gonna give you a test
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.120]   and you have to answer these on the spot."
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.200]   You would probably not say, "Oh, that's great.
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.040]   I'm really excited."
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.080]   You'd probably say, "Oh crap, I better pay attention more."
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.740]   And it is in that moment,
[00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.560]   you see it as a threat or a challenge.
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.680]   And if we can reframe that as an opportunity,
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:13.880]   like, "Yeah, I get to learn more.
[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.320]   I get to share information.
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.160]   It's gonna be better for both of us."
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.840]   That opportunistic mindset makes a big difference.
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.000]   And that's step three.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.880]   Step four of mindset really has to do with listening.
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.780]   It seems strange that we're talking about speaking,
[00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.240]   but the best way to be a good in the moment speaker
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.400]   is to listen well.
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.040]   So, you can make the right nuanced choices.
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.120]   And I'm happy to talk more about listening later.
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.960]   But those are the first four for mindset.
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.080]   Anxiety, getting out of your own way,
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.520]   seeing it as an opportunity and listening well.
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.360]   The second two steps are messaging.
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.000]   First, you have to have a structure.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.720]   Our brains are not wired to remember things
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.560]   that are just lists of information.
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.180]   We need things in a logical packaged way.
[00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:53.560]   And then finally, the final step
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.800]   is what I call the F word of communication.
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.840]   It's not that naughty one, I see you smiling.
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.280]   It's focus, we need to be focused.
[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:03.640]   Many people take us on a journey of their discovery
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.600]   of what they're saying while they're saying it,
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.560]   when they're responding spontaneously.
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:08.400]   And that doesn't work.
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.480]   We need to be clear, we need to be concise.
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.320]   So, we have to focus our messages.
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.880]   So, those six steps when practiced over time
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.640]   can help anybody become a better in the moment communicator.
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:20.480]   - I wanna go through them,
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.000]   but I do wanna ask another question.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.360]   If I rewind, you talked about
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.000]   how anyone can learn these skills.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.320]   I'm curious, let's say someone feels confident
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.880]   with their ability to speak on the spot.
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.160]   How much opportunity is there to use these to improve
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.560]   versus someone who feels uncomfortable
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:35.900]   can get to a baseline?
[00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.640]   - Yes, you can absolutely improve using these steps.
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.480]   A lot of people are good at some of these steps,
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.840]   but not all of them and really could use the practice.
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.640]   And I believe all of us can continue
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.000]   to get better at communication.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.040]   I envision improving communication as ascending a mountain
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.840]   and people are on different parts of the mountain,
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.720]   but we're all striving to get to the top.
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.080]   I don't even see the summit yet
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.400]   and I've been doing this for decades.
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.040]   So, we can all get better.
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.920]   And what it's about is the finer details
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.120]   of each of these steps.
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.680]   When you're first coming to this work
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.840]   and you're a nervous novice speaker,
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.400]   you're dealing with the big rocks.
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.280]   And now what we begin to get into is the little pebbles
[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.560]   and the sand that can help us get better at it.
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.840]   - And is there any kind of diagnostic or test
[00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.360]   or something that I could take and be like,
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.320]   "Which one do I need to focus on?"
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.920]   - Well, so I think most people need to start with anxiety.
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:24.000]   And anxiety around speaking in public is ubiquitous.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.040]   So, I often tell people to start there.
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.400]   Then the next step that I think is most important
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.840]   after managing anxiety is the messaging step.
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:33.720]   Really beginning to work on structure.
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:36.400]   I think if you said, "Hey, I'm a super busy person.
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.040]   "I can only do a little bit of work.
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.240]   "What should I do?"
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.240]   I would say start with managing anxiety,
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.960]   move then next to how do you structure your messages.
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:45.600]   All of the other steps are essential,
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.560]   but those are the two that I think will get you
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.800]   accelerated down this path the most.
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.640]   - Let's go a little deeper on anxiety
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.520]   'cause I think it comes in a lot of forms
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:56.080]   and someone that hasn't necessarily believed
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.720]   that they have it might actually have it.
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:00.600]   I think maybe our society puts too harsh of a term
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.960]   on the word anxiety to think it could mean a lot,
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.600]   but just not being confident walking out on stage
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.960]   or walking into a meeting is a form of anxiety
[00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:10.400]   and it doesn't need to debilitate you,
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:11.400]   but it's something you can manage.
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:12.280]   - That's true, that's true.
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:13.960]   I mean, it's everything from a little jitter
[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.840]   all the way up to full-on really, really anxious.
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:18.520]   So there's a wide range.
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.200]   So anxiety looms large.
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:23.360]   Those of us who study it believe it's part of being human,
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.880]   that part of getting up in front of other people
[00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:29.680]   is risk invoking and it causes us to respond
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:30.880]   as if we're under threat.
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.640]   To address it, we have to take a two-pronged approach.
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:36.520]   You have to look both at symptoms and sources.
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.680]   So Chris, I'm curious, I'll share mine first,
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:40.880]   but I'm curious what happens to you
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:42.920]   when you get nervous and being up in front of others?
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:45.080]   For me, I blush and I perspire.
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.520]   I turn red and I sweat.
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:47.360]   What happens for you?
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.240]   - It's a good timing to ask this question
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.800]   'cause on Saturday I gave a talk at a conference
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:53.880]   and I hadn't given a talk in a public,
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:55.640]   in-person setting for years.
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:59.400]   And I know the feelings before, which were really about me.
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.800]   There was always like the one or two parts of the talk
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.840]   that I knew I just didn't have 100% down.
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:06.880]   And you'll never have it 100% down, right?
[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.280]   It's like, what's the slide?
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:09.480]   In this case, there were slides.
[00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.640]   There were two slides where I thought I was likely
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.880]   to butcher something because I just couldn't remember it.
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:16.760]   And so the moment I have before going out is like,
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:19.440]   can I just feel good about the thing I feel worse about?
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.520]   - Oh, that's interesting.
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:22.640]   - I don't know the physical manifestation of that
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:24.640]   other than I guess like closing my eyes
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:26.760]   and thinking about it, pacing around the room.
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.960]   - Interesting, so for you, it's a mental thing.
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:31.240]   - I have no fear walking on the stage,
[00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:33.680]   no fear of all the people, no fear of the microphone.
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:37.480]   It's like my fear was I'm a lots of content small window.
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:40.120]   So I had a 15 minute talk and there were 48 slides.
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:41.040]   - Oh my goodness.
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.280]   - So it was very structured.
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:45.280]   And there was one part where I was talking about a study
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:46.880]   and it's actually about podcasting.
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:49.200]   And the study from the UC system
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.320]   was about in-head localization
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.320]   and how when you hear people talking in a conversation
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.000]   through headphones specifically,
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.760]   it creates the kind of intimacy
[00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:02.400]   that's almost indistinguishable from real human relations.
[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.480]   And so you'd feel like this person, you know them,
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:06.400]   they're your best friend because they're on your headphones
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:07.600]   and it creates that experience.
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.600]   But some of the nuances of that study
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:12.120]   and what they came to, I was like, am I gonna miss it?
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:12.960]   Am I gonna forget it?
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:15.240]   Am I even gonna forget that it's in-head localization
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.520]   and call it normalization?
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:18.880]   And that was the thing that was getting me tripped out.
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:20.200]   - Right, before I comment on that,
[00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:23.240]   I just wanna say right now for you and your listeners,
[00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:24.760]   we are really connecting
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:28.240]   because we are in some of your listeners earbuds as we speak.
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:29.680]   I find that research fascinating.
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:32.000]   For many people, very similar to you,
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.800]   they get in their head literally,
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.160]   not what that study was about,
[00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.080]   worrying about, am I saying it right?
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:39.680]   Am I going to make sure I get as much information
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:42.040]   as I really want to across to my audience?
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:43.640]   And that causes a lot of that pressure.
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:46.600]   That to me is more of a source than a symptom.
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:47.840]   So let me distinguish the two.
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.480]   A symptom is what physically goes on in your body.
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:53.680]   So for me, I turn red, I perspire, other people shake,
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:56.000]   some people speak really fast.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.800]   This is your body's reaction to the fight or flight response
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.680]   and there's some things we can do to manage symptoms.
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:03.800]   For example, take a deep belly breath.
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:06.160]   Make sure your exhale is longer than your inhale
[00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.520]   because it's on the exhale that the magic happens.
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.200]   You can, if you are somebody like me
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:13.400]   who blushes and perspires a lot, cool your body down.
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:15.500]   Holding something cold in the palm of your hand
[00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:17.600]   will actually reduce your core body temperature,
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:18.960]   just like when you have a fever
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.720]   and you put a cold compress on your head.
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:22.280]   So there are things that we can do
[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:23.940]   to reduce some of the symptoms.
[00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:25.820]   Now we also have to think about the sources,
[00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:27.340]   which is what you were really talking about.
[00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:29.140]   These are the things that initiate
[00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:30.680]   and exacerbate our anxiety.
[00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:33.160]   And for you, it was that internal dialogue
[00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.160]   of here's what I want to say.
[00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.120]   Can I make sure that I say it
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:39.960]   and say it in the right way to convey what I want?
[00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:42.880]   That's a lot of conversation that's going on in your head.
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:45.360]   And what that does is it steals away
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:46.960]   your cognitive bandwidth
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:48.980]   to actually focus on what you're saying.
[00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:51.040]   It's sort of like a laptop or your phone
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:53.640]   where you have lots of windows open all at the same time.
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:57.160]   When you do that, your CPU actually performs less well.
[00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.240]   And if my brain is judging and evaluating
[00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:01.400]   and I'm trying to speak something intelligent
[00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:02.280]   at the same time,
[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:05.240]   I have less cognitive resources to do either well.
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:08.400]   So I have the audacity in front of my Stanford MBA students
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:09.960]   on the first day of every class,
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:13.040]   I say we want to maximize our mediocrity.
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:15.120]   And I tell you, their jaws drop.
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.800]   Nobody in their lives has ever told them
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.120]   to maximize mediocrity.
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:19.400]   But I tell them the reason why
[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:22.320]   is when you're striving for being really, really right,
[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:23.880]   perfect in what you're doing,
[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:26.160]   you're actually reducing the ability to do it well.
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:28.200]   So you will actually do better
[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.920]   when you just focus on getting the task done,
[00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:33.280]   just answer the question, just give the feedback,
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:35.360]   just say hi to somebody during small talk.
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:36.960]   And by just focusing on that
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:40.000]   and turning down that volume of judgment and evaluation,
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.280]   you'll feel less nervous.
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:43.440]   So we have to take symptoms and sources.
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:44.540]   Everybody is different.
[00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:47.000]   What trips you up is different than what trips me up.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.880]   So that's why I have everybody I work with
[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:52.000]   create an individualized anxiety management plan.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.320]   Besides deep breathing,
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:56.400]   there is no one recommendation I would make to everybody.
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:57.560]   Everybody is different.
[00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:59.800]   And that's why I always ask, what happens for you?
[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:00.640]   You're in your head.
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:01.920]   I'm not in my head, I'm in my body.
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:03.360]   That's what causes me my issues.
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.920]   And that's how we have to work on them.
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:07.680]   - And is there a specific thing that if it's in your body,
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:09.080]   it's a deep breath and cool down.
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.980]   If it's in your head, it's a think about the fact that,
[00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:14.720]   I mean, what helped me was anytime I'm giving a talk,
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:16.720]   I always think that even if I only hit 80%
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:18.200]   of the talking points, it's gonna be great.
[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:19.960]   Like the point is not to hit a hundred.
[00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:21.840]   And that's what I do is I remind myself
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:23.240]   that I'm not gonna hit it all.
[00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:24.080]   And that's okay.
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:25.760]   - So for you, it's giving yourself permission.
[00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:26.600]   And that's great.
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:27.880]   For other people who are in their head,
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:29.600]   I tell them focus on the value
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:30.720]   you're bringing to the audience.
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:32.240]   It's not about you, it's about them.
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:34.120]   And just reminding yourself you're giving value,
[00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:35.320]   that's enough to help them.
[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:36.740]   So everybody is different.
[00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:38.200]   My first book I wrote was called
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:39.920]   "Speaking Up Without Freaking Out."
[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:42.800]   It was 50 techniques based on academic research
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:44.480]   to help people manage anxiety.
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:48.520]   I expect three to five of the 50 to work for each individual.
[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:49.520]   So everybody's different.
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:50.880]   So the advice I'd give you,
[00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:52.520]   which sounds like you're already doing this,
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:53.600]   which is to remind yourself
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:56.160]   that you're the only one who knows what you could say.
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:57.720]   We only hear what you do say.
[00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:00.580]   So if you're fine with saying what you say, that's great.
[00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:01.880]   You don't have to be nervous about it.
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:03.960]   It's those of us who say, well, I could have said this.
[00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:04.800]   I should have said that.
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:06.560]   That's where that stress comes from.
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:10.040]   - Fall is all about the back to school
[00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:12.080]   and the back to school routine checklist.
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:13.940]   And the most important task on that list
[00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:16.520]   should be securing your family's financial future,
[00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:18.240]   starting with life insurance.
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:20.440]   Our sponsor today, Fabric by Gerber Life,

[00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:36.540]   And when I say surprisingly affordable,
[00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:38.720]   I actually went online to compare prices
[00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:41.040]   and found that Fabric was highly competitive
[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:43.680]   with great policies like a million dollars in coverage
[00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:45.400]   for less than a dollar a day.

[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:14.680]   prices subject to underwriting and health questions.
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:17.960]   When it comes to building wealth,
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:20.640]   taxes are such a big part of the strategy.
[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:22.320]   And even if you've already filed,
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:23.800]   being proactive about this year
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:26.480]   to lower your future liability is so important.
[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:28.140]   And now that I'm working with Gelt,
[00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:30.320]   I finally feel like I have a partner I can trust
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:33.640]   to handle everything for my business and personal taxes.
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:36.160]   And I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:38.760]   Think of Gelt as the ultimate modern CPA.
[00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:41.180]   They not only offer an amazing tech platform
[00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:44.100]   that gives you personalized guidance to maximize deductions,
[00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:45.640]   tax credits, and savings,
[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:48.320]   but also everything is backed by an in-house team
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:50.580]   of expert CPAs who can recommend
[00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:52.480]   the most effective tax strategies
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:54.680]   to minimize risk and grow your wealth.
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:55.560]   And best of all,
[00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:57.720]   you can have this transparent open communication
[00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:00.520]   with your team in whatever way works best for you,
[00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:02.840]   whether that's on their platform, over email,
[00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:05.040]   in Slack, or scheduling a call.
[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:06.320]   Finally, my favorite story
[00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:08.400]   is that when we first onboarded with Gelt,
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:09.920]   they reviewed our past returns
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:12.720]   and found a huge mistake our prior CPA had made.
[00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:15.600]   So they refiled and got us back all that money.
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.480]   So if you're ready for a more premium,
[00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:21.080]   proactive tax strategy to optimize and file your taxes,
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:22.960]   you have to check out Gelt.
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:24.420]   And as an All The Hacks listener,
[00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:26.960]   you can skip the wait list and get started today.
[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:31.280]   Just head to allthehacks.com/Gelt, G-E-L-T.
[00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:35.560]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/G-E-L-T.
[00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:36.880]   That's managing my anxiety.
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:38.520]   I know you said the next one is messaging,
[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:40.320]   but I think for the sake of the conversation,
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:41.800]   it might be easier to go in sequence.
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:43.760]   - So the next step I've already broached,
[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:45.960]   which is this notion of striving for perfection,
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:48.960]   precludes us from actually doing well at all.
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:50.920]   It's that cognitive bandwidth issue.
[00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:53.160]   So we need to let go of being perfect,
[00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:55.720]   and we need to just focus on how we can best connect.
[00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:58.000]   So it's really about thinking about my audience,
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.920]   what's relevant and important to them.
[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:01.440]   You know, when people speak,
[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:03.840]   let's take planned speaking as an example.
[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.480]   What you did this past weekend,
[00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:07.160]   you had your slides, it was planned,
[00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:08.720]   you had thought it through in advance.
[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:11.040]   Most people, when they speak in those circumstances,
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:14.040]   define success as getting from the beginning to the end.
[00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:15.200]   My job is to speak,
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:17.880]   I am going to get everything that I've intended to say out.
[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:19.560]   That's really not what your goal is.
[00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:21.600]   Your goal is to take your material,
[00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:22.920]   connect it to your audience
[00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:24.680]   so that they better understand it.
[00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:27.440]   So if we switch that gear from being,
[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:29.840]   I gotta get it across and I gotta get it across well,
[00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:31.200]   to I have to get it out there
[00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:33.120]   so people actually really understand it,
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:35.680]   that focusing on connection and relevance
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:38.920]   is the unlock to get us out of that self-judgment
[00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:40.200]   and self-evaluation.
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:42.880]   So the way we really maximize mediocrity
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:44.360]   to do really good things
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:45.760]   is to give ourselves permission
[00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:48.720]   to focus on really connecting our content to our audience.
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:49.560]   - I don't want everyone to think,
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:50.640]   "Oh wow, this was so easy."
[00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:52.720]   The funny thing was before the talk,
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:53.960]   I was kind of hanging out in this room
[00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:55.240]   with a few of the other speakers.
[00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:57.160]   And for me, I was like,
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.320]   "Oh, I wanna go have a conversation with this other person."
[00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:00.600]   And you know, there was a guy
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:03.120]   who focuses on longevity and health tech.
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:04.720]   And I was like, "What do I talk to this guy about?"
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:07.840]   So just to let the audience listening now know,
[00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:10.200]   for as much as I felt really good about my talk,
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:11.800]   I felt equally not good
[00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:14.640]   about having a great conversation with a random person
[00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:16.800]   for whom I had a little bit of research on.
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:18.280]   And I think in a little way,
[00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:20.360]   I was like striving for perfection too much.
[00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:21.600]   I was like, "What's the perfect thing
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.420]   "I can talk about to with this person
[00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:25.020]   "that someone else isn't already coming up
[00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:25.840]   "to talk to him about?
[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:26.680]   "What do I say?"
[00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:27.520]   And I kind of got lost.
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:29.600]   So I don't know if fixing that circumstance
[00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:31.640]   is also handled in this step or not,
[00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:32.800]   but that one was hard for me.
[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:34.000]   - It certainly is addressed here.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.560]   So this whole second part of my book
[00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:37.880]   is I identify six very common
[00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:39.600]   spontaneous speaking situations
[00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:42.080]   and give very specific advice on how to manage them.
[00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:43.560]   One of them is what you're talking about,
[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:44.920]   small talk and chit-chat.
[00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:47.060]   And we put a lot of pressure on ourselves
[00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:49.120]   to be really, really interesting
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:52.320]   and be really, really insightful in those conversations.
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:53.680]   And that makes it really stressful.
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:55.920]   A friend of mine, her name is Rachel Greenwald.
[00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:57.480]   She is a very interesting woman.
[00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:00.640]   She is a professional matchmaker and an academic.
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:02.920]   And she looks at conversation and chit-chat,
[00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:04.400]   obviously small talk is part of that.
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:06.640]   And she has this great saying that I tell everybody,
[00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:09.960]   it's about being interested, not interesting.
[00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:11.800]   And that's really another way of saying
[00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:14.320]   it's about connection, not perfection.
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:16.920]   We go into small talk as it sounds like you were doing,
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:18.280]   thinking it's like playing tennis.
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:19.920]   I have to get that ball over the net
[00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:22.320]   and it has to land just right away.
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:25.360]   And instead, you need to think of it as hacky sack.
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:27.320]   You're significantly younger than I am,
[00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:28.520]   but you know what hacky sack is
[00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:29.800]   where you kick to that beanbag.
[00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:30.840]   - I am familiar.
[00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:33.480]   - In hacky sack, the goal is for me to serve it to you
[00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:34.880]   so you can keep the ball in the air
[00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:36.560]   when you serve it back to me or somebody else.
[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:39.040]   So we're actually collaborating to keep the game going.
[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:40.400]   It's not like tennis where it's a,
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:42.080]   I win, you lose sort of thing.
[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:44.880]   And when you go into these small talk situations
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:47.280]   saying it's about being interested, not interesting,
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:49.720]   lead with curiosity, lead with connection,
[00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:51.160]   then all of a sudden it gets easier.
[00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:54.520]   And that perfection idea that you were being worried about
[00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:56.440]   or were concerned about in your meeting
[00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:58.600]   the people backstage reduces.
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:19:59.440]   - Interesting.
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:01.520]   To be interested, it sounds like you need to realize
[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:04.320]   you're probably not talking as much as you might think
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:05.400]   trying to be interesting.
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:06.240]   - You bet.
[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:08.720]   - Do you have a favorite way that you open conversations
[00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:10.680]   with strangers and new people
[00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:12.680]   that might be things people would like to hear?
[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:14.760]   - I wanna put this in context of,
[00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:17.040]   when I am in appropriate situations,
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:19.880]   yes, I don't just randomly go around talking to strangers,
[00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:21.600]   although that might be interesting to do.
[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:24.720]   Yes, so we wanna avoid these doom loops
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:25.800]   that we can get into.
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:27.320]   So it's the, "Hey, Chris, how are you?"
[00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:28.560]   And you say, "Great, Matt, how are you?"
[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:30.360]   "Okay, now we're nowhere better than we were."
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:31.360]   "Hi, Chris, what do you do?"
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:32.280]   "I do podcasting."
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:33.120]   "Matt, what do you do?"
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:33.960]   "I teach."
[00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:34.800]   "All right, great."
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:35.640]   I like highlighting things
[00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:37.760]   that are in the environment in context.
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:39.440]   So if you're at an event,
[00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:40.840]   like it sounds like you were recently,
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:42.520]   you could comment on something that happened
[00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:44.560]   before you were speaking.
[00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:45.720]   Maybe there was a big keynote
[00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:48.240]   or maybe there was some kind of gala or party or whatever.
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:49.240]   You could comment on that.
[00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:51.000]   When I was writing this chapter in the book,
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.080]   I happened to go to an event and I walked in.
[00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:54.400]   I said, "I'm writing about small talk.
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:56.120]   I better practice what I'm writing about."
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:58.680]   So I noticed in the room that everybody,
[00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:00.080]   almost everybody to a person
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:02.360]   was wearing a different colored blue shirt.
[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:04.160]   There were more blue shirts than anything I'd seen.
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:05.920]   I went up to somebody I didn't know and I said,
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:07.000]   "Did I miss the memo?
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.200]   Everybody's in blue shirts."
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.440]   And the person looked around and said,
[00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:11.200]   "You're right, that's really interesting."
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:14.080]   And then we started a whole conversation around tire
[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:16.080]   and then it turned into a whole bunch of other stuff.
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:17.960]   So highlighting something in the environment
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:20.040]   can really be a nice way to start.
[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:22.400]   It gives you a commonality, a common ground.
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:26.080]   And it's not one of these trite heuristic based starts.
[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:27.520]   - I wanna go back to some of this,
[00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:29.360]   but I have another question that's a follow-up,
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:30.200]   which is the opposite.
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:31.920]   Now I'm in this small talk conversation.
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:34.000]   Do you have a tactic for when you're done?
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.120]   I find that some people
[00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:36.960]   just always have a great way to handle this.
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:39.840]   And it might not be part of thinking fast and talking smart,
[00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:41.360]   but it certainly seems like something
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:42.200]   I think you might know.
[00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:44.160]   - Well, I'd love to hear the tactics you've seen work.
[00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:46.920]   I mean, most of us, our default is biology.
[00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:49.520]   I gotta go to the bathroom, I'm hungry, I'm thirsty, right?
[00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:52.440]   The problem with doing that is one, it's very transparent.
[00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:54.000]   And two, sometimes the person's like,
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.360]   "Oh yeah, you know, I'm thirsty too."
[00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:57.080]   And now you're walking and talking more.
[00:21:57.080 --> 00:22:00.360]   So again, my friend Rachel has this great way of doing it.
[00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:02.600]   She calls it the white flag approach
[00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:04.600]   and not white flag like I surrender.
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:06.480]   If you know anything about auto racing,
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:09.400]   before the final lap, they'll wave a white flag
[00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:12.160]   to signal to everybody that this is the final lap.
[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:14.040]   So Chris, if you and I are having a chit-chat,
[00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:15.720]   small talk conversation, I might say,
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:17.560]   "Hey, there's some people over there I wanna speak with.
[00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:20.880]   But before I go, I'm really curious for you to tell me more
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:22.280]   about the last job you had,
[00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:23.520]   'cause we started talking about it.
[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:24.760]   You share more with me."
[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:26.800]   At the end of that, I say, "That's really fascinating.
[00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:28.520]   Thank you so much for the conversation.
[00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:30.160]   I'm gonna head over there and meet my friends."
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:32.160]   It's a nice, polite way to exit.
[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:33.400]   You're not surprised.
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:35.600]   I previewed that I'm going over there.
[00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:38.600]   You're able to plan for what you're gonna do next.
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:40.640]   So you're not just left there going, "Okay, now what?"
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:42.440]   So it's a very elegant way
[00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:44.280]   to politely leave a conversation.
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:46.160]   So essentially you signal you're leaving,
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:48.400]   you dive deeper into something that was said,
[00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.760]   and then you close it off with gratitude and move on.
[00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:51.600]   It works well.
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:52.720]   I've used it ever since I learned it.
[00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:54.200]   - Sounds like something I'd wanna use all the time.
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:55.560]   'Cause I think often if you're like,
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:56.640]   "Oh, I need to go here."
[00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:58.080]   It's a little bit of a snub that's like,
[00:22:58.080 --> 00:22:59.320]   "This isn't interesting."
[00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:00.520]   But in this context, you're like,
[00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:01.400]   "I need to do this thing,
[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:03.320]   but actually this is so interesting.
[00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:04.720]   I'm not gonna do it yet.
[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:05.800]   Could you give me a little bit more?"
[00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:06.640]   - That's right.
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:07.480]   It's right.
[00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:08.320]   It's a very polite way.
[00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:10.080]   And I've learned some really amazing things
[00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:11.400]   in that last moment.
[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:13.760]   Because people know it's ending.
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:16.160]   So they wanna share the key stuff, the cool stuff.
[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:17.680]   So it's really interesting to do that.
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:19.120]   - And I guess while we're on this topic
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:21.000]   of conversations with people, small talk,
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:21.960]   is there anything you do
[00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:23.840]   when people are just talking too much,
[00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:25.160]   but you kind of wanna...
[00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:26.560]   I mean, I guess if the goal is to listen,
[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:27.600]   maybe you just let them.
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:30.120]   But especially if there's three or four people there,
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:31.560]   I wonder if there's a tactic.
[00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:32.400]   - Yeah.
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:33.640]   And I'm glad you're asking this generically
[00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:35.880]   and not so I'm giving you a tip you'll use against me
[00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:37.840]   because I know I talk a lot sometimes.
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:40.160]   So the first thing, I wanna take a step back.
[00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:42.080]   And those people who study conversation
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:45.200]   have identified two types of conversational turns.
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:47.480]   If you think about it, a conversation is turn-taking.
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:50.080]   One type of turn is a supporting turn.
[00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:51.560]   It's where I support what you're saying.
[00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:53.480]   In other words, I ask you to say more about it.
[00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:55.120]   And the other is a shifting turn,
[00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:56.960]   where I take what you're talking about, the topic,
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:58.800]   and move it to something of my interest.
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:00.720]   So imagine you and I are talking and you say,
[00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:02.080]   "Hey, I just went to Hawaii."
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:03.560]   A supporting response would be,
[00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:05.440]   "Oh, really? Which island did you go to?"
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:06.640]   A shifting response would be,
[00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:08.240]   "Oh, I just went to Costa Rica."
[00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:10.400]   So you see how one supports, one shifts.
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:13.520]   Supporting responses get people to keep talking.
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:16.120]   Shifting responses stop people from talking.
[00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:18.640]   What the research suggests is you want to do
[00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:21.440]   about three quarters to two thirds of supporting,
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:24.240]   and then one quarter to one third shifting.
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:25.440]   Because if you never shift,
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.400]   if all you do is keep asking questions and probing,
[00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:28.880]   it seems like you're hiding something,
[00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:30.280]   you're interrogating somebody.
[00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:32.160]   But if all you do is talk about yourself,
[00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:33.920]   then you're not really having a conversation.
[00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:35.760]   So the first bit of advice that I have
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:38.080]   that answers your question is be mindful of
[00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:40.600]   if you're encouraging the other person to talk, right?
[00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:42.560]   So sometimes the person's talking a lot
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:43.440]   'cause you're encouraging it.
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:45.520]   If you're in a group and one person's dominating,
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:48.400]   I think the single best thing to use is a paraphrase
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:51.280]   to get the conversation back on track or take the floor away.
[00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:54.120]   I advise people who are moderators or facilitators
[00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:56.240]   in a work setting to use this same technique.
[00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:58.440]   Highlight something of value the person has said,
[00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:00.560]   name it, and then move on to something else.
[00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:02.560]   So if we're talking about your vacation to Hawaii
[00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:04.320]   and you keep going on about how great it was,
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:06.200]   making me really jealous, I might say,
[00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:08.400]   yeah, it sounds like you were able to relax a lot.
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:11.280]   In fact, I love relaxing by reading a book.
[00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:13.320]   I'm curious, what do the rest of you do to relax?
[00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:15.320]   So you see that I've commented on something you said
[00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:17.160]   and gave credence to it, I valued it,
[00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:18.920]   but then I move it away from you.
[00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:21.280]   It's the politest way I know to shut people up.
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:23.120]   - Now I'm like, oh, I have all these tactics,
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:25.160]   but like, am I walking into a conversation
[00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:26.200]   reviewing my guy?
[00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:28.120]   Like, is it just something that over time,
[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:30.080]   practice and practice, it becomes natural?
[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:32.080]   - So, I mean, the bottom line in all of this,
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:34.400]   and this is the big counterintuitive takeaway,
[00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:36.680]   I think, from my book is that you actually have to practice
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:38.280]   and prepare to be spontaneous.
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:39.720]   And when you hear that, you say, well, wait a minute,
[00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:40.560]   that sounds weird.
[00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:42.120]   But if you think about many things in your life,
[00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:43.680]   if you've ever played a sport before,
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:46.320]   you probably practiced, you probably did drills.
[00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:48.200]   And it was through those practice and drills
[00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:51.320]   that allowed you in the game to be flexible and agile.
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:53.240]   Same thing if you're a jazz musician,
[00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:55.000]   you don't just play any note or chord,
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.360]   you actually leverage notes and chords
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:58.840]   that you've practiced before.
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:00.880]   So you do have to do some practice with this.
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:02.640]   It could be a lot of practice, could be a little,
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:04.920]   it really depends, it depends on the circumstance.
[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:07.400]   But yes, you will get better by virtue of doing it.
[00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:09.640]   I certainly, my intent is not for people to go in
[00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:11.920]   with a notebook and examine everything they're doing
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:12.920]   in their interactions.
[00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:15.080]   It's just knowing a little bit about this
[00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:16.360]   can really help free you up
[00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:17.640]   and you'll start noticing things
[00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:20.080]   and you'll start finding certain things work well for you.
[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:23.320]   My mother-in-law had a black belt in small talk.
[00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:24.240]   She was amazing.
[00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:26.160]   She's from the Midwest, she would come out and visit.
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:27.440]   By the time she got off the plane,
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:30.080]   she'd have three new friends and have lunch dates
[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:31.240]   for when she got back home.
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:33.200]   And that's because of her superpower,
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:34.680]   which was to really listen
[00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:37.480]   and she had a three word amazing phrase.
[00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:39.760]   She would simply say, "Tell me more."
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:40.600]   And I asked her, I said,
[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:42.480]   "Tell me more about how you learned to do tell me more."
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:45.120]   And she said over the years of just asking people,
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:47.080]   she learned by saying, "Tell me more,"
[00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:49.040]   people would open up and share more
[00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:52.000]   and feel that she was really interested, which she was.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.440]   So you'll find your own way.
[00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:55.120]   Tell me more might not work for you,
[00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:56.400]   you might have some other way,
[00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:58.960]   but the more you do it, you find your big unlock.
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:01.080]   - Now, a question like tell me more feels like
[00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:03.120]   it's very easy, it's not very threatening,
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:04.800]   you're already in the middle of a conversation.
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:07.360]   Let's rewind to before you've gotten into that
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:09.000]   and someone poses a question at you
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.640]   and you feel maybe you're caught off guard
[00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:12.480]   and you wanna think about it
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:14.200]   like maybe reframing as an opportunity.
[00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:16.800]   I know this is kind of comes to reframing the circumstances,
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:18.200]   which we're back to number three,
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:19.720]   but maybe that'll be our segue.
[00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:21.880]   - Yeah, so if somebody asks a question
[00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:24.120]   or any situation where you're caught off guard,
[00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:25.640]   you need to give yourself a little time
[00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:26.640]   and there are three ways to do it.
[00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:27.600]   One is to pause.
[00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:30.960]   Many of us feel a lot of pressure to respond right away
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:32.640]   and we don't need to, you can take a beat,
[00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:34.960]   you can just take a pause for a second and then respond.
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:37.920]   We feel like there's this time to respond pressure
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:39.360]   and you can take a moment.
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:41.400]   Second, you could ask a clarifying question
[00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:42.800]   that buys you some time as well.
[00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:44.160]   It also helps make sure
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:45.960]   that you're going to respond appropriately.
[00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:47.920]   And then finally, you can leverage a paraphrase.
[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:50.280]   So if you ask me a question or ask me for feedback,
[00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:52.760]   I can paraphrase, not like a five-year-old
[00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:54.840]   who repeats verbatim what you say,
[00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:56.720]   but I could highlight something in the question
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:58.680]   or the ask that you've had of me.
[00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:00.120]   And again, that buys me time.
[00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:02.520]   Both asking questions and paraphrasing
[00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:04.960]   are lower order cognitive skills.
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:07.080]   In other words, we can do other things
[00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:09.000]   while paraphrasing in questioning.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.040]   So there are ways to buy yourself time
[00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:14.200]   to get your feet under you so that you can respond.
[00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:16.040]   - Are there things you would also do in that moment
[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:19.040]   if you're feeling very caught off guard and you're not sure?
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:21.360]   Or maybe one thing that I think is interesting
[00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:23.080]   as I observe my three-year-old,
[00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:25.320]   if I ask her a question and she doesn't know the answer,
[00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:26.400]   she just says, "I don't know."
[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:28.520]   And like so often, I think as adults,
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:30.240]   we feel, especially now that I'm a parent,
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:32.320]   I feel obliged to give an answer.
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:35.760]   And I think in many cases, it's probably just fine to say,
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:37.600]   you know what, I'm not really an expert on that topic.
[00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:38.440]   I don't have an answer.
[00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:40.200]   Like, is that the thing we need to learn
[00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:41.680]   if we feel like we're caught off guard
[00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:42.520]   and we're too defensive?
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:44.280]   Maybe the answer is you don't have to answer.
[00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:45.480]   - So I think that's true,
[00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:47.280]   but I wanna go back to the fact that it's lovely
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:48.560]   that you have a young child
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:50.280]   who actually wants to hear your answers.
[00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:53.120]   I have teenagers and they are not interested in my answers,
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:55.720]   nor do they think I have a good answer to their questions.
[00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:58.200]   My son the other day had to do a presentation in class.
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:28:59.640]   I said, "Oh, is there anything I can do to help you?"
[00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:01.440]   And he's like, "No, what do you know about this stuff?"
[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:04.320]   And I'm like, "This is one thing I actually know a lot about."
[00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:05.560]   And it's just funny.
[00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:07.360]   Yes, we do not always have to respond.
[00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:09.320]   And the expectation that we will always have
[00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:12.040]   the right answer or an answer can get us in trouble.
[00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:14.680]   If you do not know the answer, my advice is this.
[00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:16.040]   You say, "I don't know.
[00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:17.520]   I'm going to look to find out.
[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:18.720]   I will get back to you."
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:20.160]   And if you have a hunch or an inkling,
[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:21.980]   say my hunch or inkling is it's this.
[00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:23.320]   We actually know of research,
[00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:24.880]   or I know of research that has shown
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:28.100]   that doing that bolsters your credibility in some cases
[00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:30.000]   more than actually giving the right answer.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.280]   Because one, you're being honest.
[00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:34.200]   Two, you're demonstrating tenacity
[00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:35.880]   and that you're gonna go find the answer.
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:38.120]   And three, you're demonstrating that you can think
[00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:40.880]   beyond what you know by saying my hunch or inkling is.
[00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:42.920]   So sometimes saying, "I don't know,"
[00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:44.720]   and then explaining how you'll follow up
[00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:48.140]   actually gives more value to your credibility
[00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:49.640]   than actually just answering the question.
[00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:51.420]   Now, if you're doing that to every question,
[00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:52.960]   that certainly is a different issue.
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:54.840]   But I don't think it's reasonable for everybody
[00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:57.720]   to expect to know every answer to every question.
[00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:58.560]   - Interesting.
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:00.280]   And so it's funny 'cause I have a tactic
[00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:02.120]   that as soon as you said what you said
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:04.320]   about bolstering credibility, I thought I'd share,
[00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:06.400]   which when we were fundraising for my company,
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:07.800]   investors will ask you questions
[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:08.840]   and you have to give answers.
[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:11.800]   And there are some questions where the answer is fine
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:14.120]   if it's not backed up with data or premeditated.
[00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:16.160]   But there are also some questions that I think
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:18.600]   sometimes people give less credibility to
[00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:19.920]   when you're speaking on the spot.
[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:22.200]   And so a tactic I had was every question
[00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:23.560]   I thought someone could ask,
[00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:26.000]   I created a slide to back up the answer.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.260]   And so people would say like,
[00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:30.200]   "Do you think that this product will work at scale?"
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:32.440]   Every entrepreneur is gonna answer that question.
[00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:33.280]   Yes, of course.
[00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:34.800]   Here's five reasons why it will.
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:37.060]   You know, it always feels like when you're off the cuff
[00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:38.080]   with an answer like that,
[00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:39.120]   people might not believe it.
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:40.680]   So I would just jump to the slide
[00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:41.780]   and I won't get into the nuance
[00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:43.840]   of how I found all these slides on the fly,
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:45.880]   but I would say, "Actually, yes, I do have an answer."
[00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:47.000]   And then I would point to it.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.720]   And I'd basically put myself in the situation
[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:51.520]   to be caught off guard in advance,
[00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:53.120]   wrote down what I would say.
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:55.220]   And that also bolstered the credibility
[00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:57.360]   because people were like, "Oh, if you wrote it down,
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:58.520]   it must be more true
[00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:00.360]   than if you just thought about it on the fly."
[00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:02.040]   - Well, and I think it also helped
[00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:04.800]   because you actually took the time to think about it
[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:06.080]   and anticipate their questions.
[00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:09.560]   We are really impressed when people focus on our needs
[00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:10.720]   in our communication.
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:13.080]   And you just gave a great example
[00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:14.800]   of something I really believe in,
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:17.720]   which is the practice and preparation to be spontaneous.
[00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:20.080]   You thought in advance of what are some
[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:21.840]   of the specific questions or challenges
[00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:22.840]   that people would bring up?
[00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:24.320]   And you probably found those questions
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:25.720]   based on your experience.
[00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:28.200]   Maybe you asked people, maybe you did some research.
[00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:30.100]   You can use generative AI and say,
[00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:32.320]   "I'm pitching a product of this to these people.
[00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:33.800]   What are questions they might ask?"
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:36.000]   So there's a lot you can do to prepare.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.320]   And you went one step further
[00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:39.320]   and created actual content to support it.
[00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:40.240]   That's awesome.
[00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:42.240]   Stockpiling potential data
[00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:44.240]   or information you can use is great.
[00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:45.080]   Think of it this way.
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:46.440]   A structure is a recipe,
[00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:48.080]   and we haven't really talked a lot about structure,
[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:49.480]   but a structure is a recipe.
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:51.200]   And the stockpiled information,
[00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:53.800]   like your pre-prepared slides, are the ingredients.
[00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:55.760]   So all I have to do is assemble.
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:57.080]   I can be a really good cook
[00:31:57.080 --> 00:31:59.520]   if I have a good recipe and good ingredients.
[00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:00.400]   I can do that.
[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:02.140]   And that's what we're asking people to do
[00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:03.600]   in spontaneous situations.
[00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:04.960]   And it sounds like you did that well.
[00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:06.000]   I mean, we did raise the money.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.080]   The company didn't work out,
[00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:08.400]   but at least the pitch worked.
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:09.240]   That's right.
[00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:10.320]   Well, that's part of the battle.
[00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:13.720]   For the podcast, and really just because I like it,
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:16.520]   I read a lot of finance news, probably too much,
[00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:19.000]   but it never gets old seeing one of my partners in the news,
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.800]   and even better when it's because a million-dollar Banksy
[00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:25.120]   got everyday investors a 32% net return.
[00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:27.280]   But I'm not talking about Banksy handing out cash.
[00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:29.720]   I'm talking about today's sponsor, Masterworks,
[00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:31.040]   the art investing platform
[00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:34.480]   that's sold over $45 million worth of art to date
[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:37.400]   with the proceeds delivered to investors just like us.
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:40.080]   And I say us because I've been investing with Masterworks
[00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:41.120]   for over a year.
[00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:44.880]   And while a 32% net return is obviously fantastic,
[00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:46.360]   every one of their sales to date
[00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:48.560]   has returned a net profit to their investors.
[00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:50.960]   And from a recent Bank of America report,
[00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:53.400]   quote, "Despite volatility in capital markets,
[00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:56.080]   "art prices have outpaced 2019 highs,
[00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:58.560]   "and valuations have risen steadily."
[00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:02.040]   So come join Masterworks' more than 700,000 users.
[00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:04.080]   And when you do, please support the show
[00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:06.520]   and get yourself priority access to the platform

[00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:23.440]   My fitness routine this year had a few rocky starts,
[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:25.080]   but I am back into it now.
[00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:27.560]   And honestly, one of the things that helped me get back
[00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:29.760]   is that I just added some new workout gear.
[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:31.040]   And if I'm gonna buy more,
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:33.440]   why not have the best performance apparel out there,
[00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:35.040]   which I think is Viori,
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:36.880]   and I am excited to be partnering with them
[00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:38.120]   for this episode.
[00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:41.280]   Viori makes performance apparel that's incredibly versatile.
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:43.160]   Everything's designed to work out in,
[00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:45.440]   but it doesn't look or feel like it at all.
[00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:47.040]   And it is so freaking comfortable,
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:49.000]   you will wanna wear it all the time.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.080]   But it's not just for men.
[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:53.320]   My wife is obsessed with Viori as much as I am.
[00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:54.480]   While my personal favorite
[00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:56.880]   will probably always be the Sunday Performance Joggers,
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:58.400]   I have at least three pairs.
[00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:00.800]   I just got a few pairs of the Core Shorts
[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:03.840]   and three or four Strato Tech Tees, and I'm loving them.
[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:06.520]   Honestly, I can't think of the last time I went on a run,
[00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:08.760]   bike ride, or walk in anything else.
[00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:10.240]   Their products are so versatile,
[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:12.520]   you can use them for just about any activity,
[00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:14.640]   whether it's running, training, or yoga,
[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:17.520]   but they're also great for lounging, running around town,
[00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:18.800]   or they even have a few things
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:20.480]   you can wear for a night out.
[00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:23.280]   Honestly, I think Viori is an investment in your happiness.
[00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:24.640]   And for all the Hacks listeners,

[00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:04.960]   - I wanna get off of mindset,
[00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:07.040]   but the last thing was on listening.
[00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:08.280]   We've talked a bit about it,
[00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:09.720]   but I just wanna go a little deeper
[00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:11.520]   because it seems like it's really important.
[00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:13.920]   Especially, I've had lots of conversations on the podcast
[00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:17.040]   about negotiating and why listening can be really valuable.
[00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:20.440]   Any other tactics for people to become better listeners?
[00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:21.680]   - Well, the first thing is to acknowledge
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:22.920]   that we're not good at it, right?
[00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:24.520]   Most of us don't listen well enough.
[00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:26.480]   We listen just enough to get the gist
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:27.640]   of what somebody is saying.
[00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:29.080]   And then we start judging, evaluating,
[00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:30.120]   rehearsing, planning.
[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:32.040]   So we all need to get better at listening.
[00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:34.720]   And believe me, my wife reminds me all the time
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:36.760]   that I need to practice what I teach.
[00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:38.120]   So we can all still work on it.
[00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:40.360]   I like to tell people, when you're listening,
[00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:42.680]   listen for what is the bottom line,
[00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:44.320]   the crux of what somebody is saying.
[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:46.400]   Because when you listen more deeply,
[00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:48.880]   you will actually attend to more information.
[00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:50.920]   And in the book of my chapter all about listening,
[00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:53.360]   I borrow from one of my colleagues at the business school.
[00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:54.880]   His name is Collins Dobbs.
[00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:57.440]   And he teaches a class on crucial conversations.
[00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:59.320]   And he has this methodology he likes.
[00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:01.480]   With his permission, I borrowed it for listening.
[00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:04.400]   And it's three things, pace, space, grace.
[00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:07.080]   We, as you well know, live in a frenetic world.
[00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:08.120]   Lots are going on.
[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:09.960]   We've got lots of demands on our time.
[00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:12.120]   You have to slow down to listen well.
[00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:14.560]   You can't listen well while running around.
[00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:16.640]   So you have to slow down, slow the pace.
[00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:18.320]   Second, you have to make the space.
[00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:19.840]   Sometimes it's physical space.
[00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:21.880]   Get to a place where you can actually hear
[00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:22.960]   what the person is saying.
[00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:24.960]   But more importantly is mental space.
[00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:26.920]   Our head is so cluttered with our judgments,
[00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:29.200]   our evaluations, our thinking about what's next.
[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:30.440]   I have to be present.
[00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:32.760]   And I have to give myself mental attention
[00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:34.000]   to focus on what you're saying.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   And then finally, grace.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.560]   I have to give myself permission
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:38.240]   to not only listen to what you're saying,
[00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:39.680]   but notice the context
[00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:41.640]   and how you're interacting in the context.
[00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:44.320]   And also to listen to my intuition.
[00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:46.000]   I've been around a while.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.920]   I have some past experience.
[00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:50.200]   What is that telling me based on what you're saying?
[00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:52.080]   Allow me to give you a quick example, Chris.
[00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:54.040]   Imagine you and I come out of a meeting
[00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:55.120]   and you turn to me and you say,
[00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:56.560]   Matt, how do you think that went?
[00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:58.080]   If I'm listening superficially,
[00:36:58.080 --> 00:36:59.400]   I hear Chris wants feedback.
[00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:00.920]   Well, Chris, I think you screwed it up here.
[00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:02.040]   I think we could have done better here.
[00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:03.240]   Next time we should do this.
[00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:05.600]   But had I really listened with pace, space, grace,
[00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:07.400]   slowed down, really focused,
[00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:08.720]   allowed myself some intuition,
[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:10.240]   I might've noticed that you came out
[00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:11.360]   the back door of the room.
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:12.480]   I came out the front door.
[00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:13.520]   You were looking down
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:15.600]   and not having your normal animated voice
[00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:17.000]   when you asked me for the feedback.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.600]   Maybe, just maybe what you wanted was not feedback,
[00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:22.920]   but support because you didn't feel it went so well.
[00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:24.720]   But I didn't pay any attention to that.
[00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:27.320]   And I just itemized all the things that you did wrong.
[00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:29.080]   Now I've made you feel worse.
[00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:31.320]   Perhaps had I been listening more intently,
[00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:32.680]   I might've come back to you and said,
[00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:33.840]   would you like me to share some thoughts
[00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:35.160]   on what we could do better next time?
[00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:37.520]   Or do you want me just to listen to what you have to say?
[00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:39.200]   And then I make it a choice for you.
[00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:41.160]   So that's why listening is so important
[00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:43.840]   because we can be wrong with what's needed in the moment
[00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:45.640]   if we're not really paying attention.
[00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:47.560]   - I like the clarifying, you know, you could say,
[00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:49.040]   are you more interested in what went well,
[00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:50.480]   what didn't go, whatever the question is,
[00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:51.840]   give them a little more guidance,
[00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:53.560]   which helps if you weren't listening
[00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:55.280]   and you realize after the fact,
[00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:57.600]   oh crap, I wasn't listening, but I want to,
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:59.440]   I guess there's still ability to recover
[00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:01.000]   with some clarifying questions.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.840]   - Absolutely, and it shows you really want to connect.
[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:05.480]   - So let's recap mindset.
[00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:08.320]   - The four mindset steps are first, manage anxiety,
[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:09.760]   tame that anxiety beast.
[00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:12.720]   The second is about connection over perfection.
[00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:15.000]   It's about dialing down the judgment
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.080]   and evaluation we do when we speak.
[00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:20.760]   The third step is seeing these speaking as opportunities,
[00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:22.200]   not threats and challenges.
[00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:24.720]   And then finally listen for the bottom line
[00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:25.880]   of what the person is saying.
[00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:27.320]   If you do those four things,
[00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:29.040]   you will be in a much better position
[00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:30.680]   to speak in the moment.
[00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:32.680]   - I really wish we had talked about this last week,
[00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:34.120]   but alas, here we are.
[00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:35.720]   - I'm sure you did so well last week
[00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:37.360]   that you're gonna have an opportunity again
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:38.320]   this coming week.
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:39.360]   - Okay, so let's move on.
[00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:40.760]   Let's talk about messaging.
[00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:44.080]   - Absolutely, so messaging is really, really important.
[00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:46.040]   It's all about structure.
[00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:49.640]   Our brains are not wired for lists and detail.
[00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:50.680]   You know, when's the last time
[00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:51.960]   you heard somebody ramble, Chris?
[00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:53.240]   Probably really recently.
[00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:54.880]   Hopefully not at this moment, right?
[00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:56.560]   And how's it feel when somebody rambles?
[00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:57.440]   It's stressful.
[00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:59.520]   It's like, why the heck is the person saying this?
[00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:01.000]   Why are they saying it in this way?
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.640]   So we either have to intently study what's being said
[00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:04.520]   or we just give up.
[00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:06.160]   We're like, that's it, I'm not gonna pay attention.
[00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:08.040]   Our brains are wired for structure.
[00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:10.520]   Something that has a beginning, a middle, and an end.
[00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:13.200]   A logical connection of ideas.
[00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:14.640]   Let me give you an example of a structure
[00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:16.560]   and I'm happy to talk about lots of other structures.
[00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:17.960]   The whole second part of the book
[00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:19.800]   assigns a particular structure
[00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:21.400]   to all these different types
[00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:23.200]   of spontaneous speaking situations.
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:26.280]   Because my goal is that everybody has at least one tool
[00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:28.600]   in their toolkit so they can pull it out
[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:30.280]   if they need to in a situation
[00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:31.840]   where they don't know what to do or what to say.
[00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:32.720]   The one I'll share with you
[00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:34.360]   because you've talked about pitching before,
[00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:35.560]   it's a very common one.
[00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:37.560]   Problem, solution, benefit.
[00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:40.360]   I bet every pitch you ever did or heard
[00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:41.960]   started with, here's this issue,
[00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:44.280]   here's how we think we can address it or make it better,
[00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:45.880]   and here's the benefit if we do so.
[00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:47.080]   Sometimes it's not an issue,
[00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:48.400]   sometimes it's an opportunity.
[00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:50.400]   Nothing's wrong, but we could make it better.
[00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:52.640]   So by using problem, solution, benefit,
[00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:54.880]   you have a logical connection of ideas,
[00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:56.920]   you build in connection and transition
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:58.280]   among the different points.
[00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:00.640]   Now that you understand the problem, how do we solve it?
[00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:03.720]   And it keeps everybody together and packages it up nicely.
[00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:06.120]   And for you, as the communicator,
[00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:08.040]   it helps you focus on your message.
[00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:09.000]   So when you say something,
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:10.400]   you could say it in lots of different ways.
[00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:12.600]   If I know I'm gonna say it, problem, solution, benefit,
[00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:13.680]   it helps me focus.
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:18.240]   So having a structure is critical to your communication.
[00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:20.200]   - My mind went wild when you just said that,
[00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:22.920]   'cause I was like, wow, if I just had the foresight
[00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:24.600]   before talking about anything, really,
[00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:28.120]   to just frame it in a new way, it would be really powerful.
[00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:30.280]   Are there other quick, easy structures
[00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:31.120]   that you could mention?
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:32.640]   We don't need to go into all the detail,
[00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:34.040]   but just to inspire us.
[00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:35.360]   - I'm glad you had that epiphany.
[00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:36.200]   And you know what?
[00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:38.560]   I have a book that can help you solve that problem.
[00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:40.240]   So yeah, I mean, that's really what it is.
[00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:42.040]   It's really interesting the reactions people have
[00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:43.200]   when I talk to them about this.
[00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:45.760]   People are like, that structure thing is fantastic.
[00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:47.200]   And then when we talk about the next step,
[00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:48.800]   if we get into the focus thing,
[00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:50.360]   there are a couple of things I'll share about focus
[00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:51.200]   that really, and people are like,
[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:53.320]   oh, I'm gonna be much more clear and concise now.
[00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:54.840]   So there are a couple other structures.
[00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:55.680]   My favorite structure,
[00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:57.900]   and the one I call the Swiss army knife of all structures,
[00:40:57.900 --> 00:41:00.000]   'cause you can use it in so many circumstances,
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.520]   is three questions.
[00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:03.420]   What, so what, now what?
[00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:04.920]   If you answer those three questions,
[00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:07.200]   you have a nicely structured response.
[00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:08.600]   Let me give you more detail.
[00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:10.880]   The what is your idea, your product, your service,
[00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:12.520]   your offering, your notion.
[00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:15.080]   So what is, why is it relevant or important to the person
[00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:16.200]   or people you're talking to?
[00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:17.880]   And the now what is what comes next?
[00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:20.200]   Maybe it's set up a meeting, take questions,
[00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:21.880]   give some feedback, whatever.
[00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:23.720]   So let me share with you how this could work.
[00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:25.160]   Imagine I'm doing an update.
[00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:27.600]   Many people have update meetings they have to do.
[00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:29.720]   They have to say what they're working on, et cetera.
[00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:31.680]   The what is your update.
[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:33.240]   The so what is why it's important,
[00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:35.080]   and the now what is what you're going to do next.
[00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:36.480]   It's packaged nicely.
[00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:38.080]   If you ask me for feedback,
[00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:39.680]   and this time you really want it,
[00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:41.480]   I could give you feedback as the what.
[00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:42.920]   The so what is why it's important,
[00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:44.920]   and then the now what is what I'd like you to do differently.
[00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:47.000]   So imagine we come out of that very same meeting,
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.360]   and this time you really want feedback.
[00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:50.160]   I might say, you did a great job,
[00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:53.000]   except when you talked about the implementation plan.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:56.400]   You spoke quickly and you didn't go into as much depth
[00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:57.720]   as you did the other parts.
[00:41:57.720 --> 00:41:59.800]   When you speak quickly without giving depth,
[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:01.480]   people think you're not as prepared.
[00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:03.600]   Next time, I'd like you to slow down
[00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:05.840]   and include these two specific examples.
[00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:08.800]   That was what, so what, now what, help me package it.
[00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:10.400]   When you're writing an email, I don't know about you,
[00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:11.640]   I get emails and I stare at them.
[00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:13.360]   I'm like, what the heck is this person want?
[00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:15.080]   Make the subject line the now what,
[00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:17.520]   the body of the email is the what, and the so what.
[00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:20.720]   So you can use this structure in so many ways.
[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:22.240]   I know you're going to ask this question
[00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:24.040]   because I know you think about how,
[00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:25.400]   okay, great, how could I use it?
[00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:27.400]   Practice, and here's how you practice.
[00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:29.280]   After you listen to your favorite podcast,
[00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:30.960]   I want you to pause it, stop it,
[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:32.200]   and say, what was that about?
[00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:33.520]   Why is it important to me?
[00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:34.760]   Or what can I take away from it?
[00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:37.400]   And then the now what is what can I do with that information?
[00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:39.520]   So by quizzing yourself, you're training that,
[00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:42.000]   your brain to see the world in that structure.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.520]   Next time you watch an advertisement on TV,
[00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:46.280]   ask what problem are they solving?
[00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:47.360]   How are they solving it?
[00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:49.440]   And what's the benefit they're saying I'll take from it?
[00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:51.720]   And by seeing it and reflecting on it,
[00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:54.640]   you actually learn to get better at deploying it.
[00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:56.200]   - Interesting, so you could just use this
[00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:58.280]   anytime you're seeing something happen in the world.
[00:42:58.280 --> 00:42:59.360]   And the thing came to mind,
[00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:01.080]   we haven't talked at all about credit card points
[00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:01.960]   or miles or anything.
[00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:03.960]   That's a theme that comes through this show.
[00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:04.840]   And I was just thinking,
[00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:06.480]   oh, if I were telling a friend about it,
[00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:08.600]   I'd say, oh, the problem is, you know,
[00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:10.640]   you don't have a card that optimizes this,
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:12.520]   here's the solution, here's the benefit.
[00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:15.120]   I'm already running through examples in my mind,
[00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:18.000]   which maybe isn't the most present way I could be here,
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.960]   but I blame you for that.
[00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:22.920]   A lot of these examples though, are all professional.
[00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:25.840]   And so I wanna jump to maybe a circumstance
[00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:28.200]   that a lot of people have been put in on the personal side.
[00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:29.720]   It's like, well, what if I'm giving a toast?
[00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:32.120]   What if I'm, you know, doing something at a wedding,
[00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:33.000]   friend's dinner?
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.440]   How would you think about a framework for that?
[00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:37.920]   - So that's one of the many areas
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:39.520]   that I talk about in the second part of the book.
[00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:41.720]   Toasts and tributes are a very common
[00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:43.360]   spontaneous speaking activity.
[00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:46.920]   And we have all witnessed horrific toasts and tributes.
[00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:47.760]   - So many.
[00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:48.920]   - Chris, tell me one thing you've noticed
[00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:50.520]   in seeing different toasts or tributes
[00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:51.400]   that people do wrong.
[00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:53.160]   I'll start, they make it about themselves
[00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:55.040]   and not the event or the person they're toasting.
[00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:56.240]   What's something you've noticed?
[00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:57.440]   - It's just, it keeps going.
[00:43:57.440 --> 00:43:58.280]   It never ends.
[00:43:58.280 --> 00:43:59.120]   - That's right, right.
[00:43:59.120 --> 00:43:59.960]   It's not concise.
[00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:01.400]   - Or they use a lot of inside jokes
[00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:03.080]   that no one in the room understands.
[00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:05.160]   - So we know what a bad toast or tribute looks like.
[00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:08.240]   So I have a structure that I like to encourage people to use
[00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:10.280]   and it has an acronym.
[00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:13.360]   It is WHAT, W-H-A-T.
[00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:15.920]   The W stands for why are we all here?
[00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:16.960]   So when you give a toast,
[00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:18.640]   you have to make sure everybody knows why you're here.
[00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:20.280]   Now, clearly, if you're at a wedding,
[00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:21.560]   you don't have to say we're at a wedding.
[00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:22.560]   People figured it out.
[00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:24.160]   The way people are dressed and what happened.
[00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:25.720]   But if you're at a corporate event
[00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:27.120]   and you're asked to stand up
[00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:29.960]   and give a team a particular tribute for something they did,
[00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:31.800]   you might wanna say why you're speaking right now.
[00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:34.000]   Hey, that team that released that product last week,
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:34.840]   really important.
[00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:36.960]   So sometimes you have to make sure everybody knows
[00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:38.360]   what you're giving a tribute to.
[00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:40.520]   The H is for how are you connected?
[00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:42.200]   Now, if you're doing a tribute at work
[00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:43.520]   and you're the boss and you stand up,
[00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:44.720]   you don't have to say I'm the boss.
[00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:45.560]   People know that.
[00:44:45.560 --> 00:44:46.840]   But if you're at a wedding
[00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:47.960]   and you stand up to give a toast,
[00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:49.560]   many people might not know who you are.
[00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:51.520]   You might say I've known the groom for 20 years.
[00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:53.080]   Oh, okay, that's why you're speaking.
[00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:54.840]   So sometimes you have to explain
[00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:56.480]   how you're connected to the event.
[00:44:56.480 --> 00:44:59.000]   Then the next part is an anecdote or two.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.800]   And there's some really big advice for those anecdotes.
[00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:03.960]   One, make them clear and concise.
[00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:05.520]   Make them relevant to everybody.
[00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:07.440]   Obviously keep them appropriate.
[00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:09.480]   And that will help you be really tight and clear.
[00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:11.360]   So you tell a story or two.
[00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:13.800]   And then the T stands for thank you or toast.
[00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:15.600]   So at a wedding, I might say cheers
[00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:16.640]   and you actually give a toast.
[00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:19.400]   If I am giving a tribute at work or something like that,
[00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:21.080]   I might say thank you to the team.
[00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:23.320]   I look forward to seeing the future success.
[00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:24.640]   So why are you here?
[00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:25.800]   How are you connected?
[00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:27.800]   Anecdote or two, thank you or toast.
[00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:29.560]   And if you follow that roadmap,
[00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:31.640]   it gets you through toasts very effectively.
[00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:33.000]   - I don't have a toast coming up.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:34.440]   Maybe I just need to create one.
[00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:35.280]   - There you go.
[00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:37.280]   You can toast to the success of our episode together.
[00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:38.120]   - Exactly.
[00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:40.040]   Where does humor fit into any of this?
[00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:41.480]   We haven't talked about humor at all,
[00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:44.240]   but I feel like it's something that when it happens,
[00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:45.840]   it makes a conversation better,
[00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:48.520]   but when it's forced, it makes a conversation awkward.
[00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:49.360]   - Absolutely.
[00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:52.840]   So I call humor graduate school version engagement.
[00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:54.680]   You really have to be careful.
[00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:56.680]   I wanna give a tangential advice.
[00:45:56.680 --> 00:45:58.720]   Two of my colleagues at Stanford's Business School,
[00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:00.600]   Jennifer Ocker and Naomi Bagdonas,
[00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:02.560]   wrote a book called "Humor Seriously"
[00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:04.200]   and they teach a class on the same topic.
[00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:06.600]   It is the only business book I have ever read
[00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:08.320]   where I was laughing out loud.
[00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:11.200]   And they give very good advice about how to be funny,
[00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:13.240]   how to find your own sense of humor
[00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:16.160]   that's appropriate for work situations.
[00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:19.400]   So anybody interested in it, I think it's a great resource.
[00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:21.800]   Humor, you have to, as you said, you have to be careful.
[00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:25.280]   I am a big fan of focus grouping humor beforehand.
[00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:26.640]   Now I know that sounds a little weird
[00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:28.600]   for somebody who's talking about spontaneous speaking,
[00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:31.200]   but we are not the best judges of our own humor, right?
[00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:32.360]   I think I'm really funny.
[00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:33.920]   The world doesn't always agree with me.
[00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:35.560]   It's in my best interest to say,
[00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:37.480]   hey, I'm going to this event.
[00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:39.160]   I might be put on the spot to speak.
[00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:40.720]   If I were to say this, is that funny?
[00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:42.400]   And then listen to what people say.
[00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:44.320]   So humor is a great way to connect.
[00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:47.600]   It's a way of building what we academics call immediacy.
[00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:51.200]   We feel close to somebody, but if it backfires,
[00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:52.480]   it can really work against you.
[00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:54.920]   I'll give advice that I think Jennifer and Naomi would say.
[00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:57.600]   One, make it about yourself, not about others.
[00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:00.560]   Two, it's about highlighting everyday common things
[00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:03.600]   that we all can experience rather than differences
[00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:04.560]   that people have.
[00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:06.440]   And if you do those two things, your humor
[00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:10.040]   is more likely to not offend and perhaps even be funnier.
[00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:11.720]   I was thinking back about something
[00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:13.480]   that I think you said in the book, which
[00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:15.800]   was that a lot of people think structure is negative,
[00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:17.320]   but you think it sets people free.
[00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:18.120]   Absolutely.
[00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:19.560]   And I'll just share something interesting
[00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:21.200]   that reminded me of budgeting, which
[00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:24.120]   is someone once said people think of budgets as restrictive,
[00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:26.400]   and I see them as making life easier.
[00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:28.400]   I wonder if there are other elements of life
[00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:31.600]   where structure is perceived as being restrictive.
[00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:33.360]   But with a budget, I know a lot of people
[00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:35.400]   who use budgets as a way to say, well, now I
[00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:39.240]   have the permission to spend $20,000 a year on a vacation
[00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:42.840]   or $4,000 a year on electronics, whatever it is.
[00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:44.280]   And because you budgeted it for it,
[00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:46.640]   it actually feels freeing to be able to use it.
[00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:48.560]   I thank you for that, Chris, because I'm going to--
[00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:50.000]   if you don't mind, don't trademark that,
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.480]   because I'm going to steal that example, because I am often
[00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:55.840]   in situations where I have to say that structure is freeing.
[00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:57.960]   And I have a few examples I always use,
[00:47:57.960 --> 00:47:59.200]   but I'm going to use that budgeting one.
[00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:01.360]   The one I often use is I interviewed somebody
[00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:03.720]   for the book who is a playground designer.
[00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:05.640]   She designs playgrounds for kids.
[00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:08.120]   And I said, it seems counterintuitive to me.
[00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:10.600]   Why not just have an open field, an open space, right?
[00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:11.680]   Kids are really creative.
[00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:13.000]   And she said that's not true.
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:17.240]   She said kids actually have more creative play, play longer,
[00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:19.400]   and others observing the play see it as actually
[00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:22.160]   more interesting and fun when there is a play structure,
[00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:24.000]   because it gives them a starting point.
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:25.400]   It gives them an anchor point.
[00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:27.720]   If you put kids in an open field and say play,
[00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:29.440]   she said ultimately what they end up doing
[00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:31.600]   is using each other as a play structure,
[00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:33.360]   and people get hurt and in trouble.
[00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:35.720]   So it's an example of where the structure actually
[00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:36.320]   sets you free.
[00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:37.900]   I'll give you another one I often use.
[00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:40.480]   Many people know about improv, improvisation, right?
[00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:42.800]   And you think, well, these people are just making it up
[00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:43.520]   on the spot.
[00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:45.160]   Well, they are generating new ideas,
[00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:47.200]   but they're following very specific rules.
[00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:49.200]   The one everybody knows of is yes and.
[00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:51.480]   No improv person worth their salt
[00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:53.680]   is going to go on a stage and say, oh, I'm grandma.
[00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:55.220]   And the other person is going to say, no, you're not.
[00:48:55.220 --> 00:48:56.040]   You're grandpa.
[00:48:56.040 --> 00:48:56.920]   Absolutely not.
[00:48:56.920 --> 00:48:58.000]   They're like, hi, grandma.
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:48:58.720]   How are you?
[00:48:58.720 --> 00:48:59.920]   Did you make me some cookies?
[00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:01.680]   So they adopt and adapt.
[00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:02.600]   They follow rules.
[00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:03.400]   Yes and.
[00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:04.840]   Make your partner look good.
[00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:07.800]   Sometimes do nothing and just let the scene play out.
[00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:09.680]   There's particular rules, structure
[00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:12.680]   that they follow that allows them to be creative.
[00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:14.320]   So I love your budgeting example.
[00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:16.000]   It's exactly the same point.
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:17.200]   I think the same thing is true, by the way,
[00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:19.080]   if you need more examples about sports.
[00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:20.800]   The reason sports are interesting
[00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:22.360]   is because there are rules.
[00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:23.880]   And if there were no rules, it would
[00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:25.560]   be a lot less interesting to watch,
[00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:27.000]   because it would just happen.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:28.040]   And it'd be chaos, right?
[00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:29.960]   You wouldn't know, is that good or bad or whatever?
[00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:30.760]   Yeah, no, I agree.
[00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:32.360]   I think the rules are important.
[00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:34.800]   We just went back and forth on a lot of different things.
[00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:36.680]   We could have been more clear and concise there
[00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:38.240]   and just closed off the messaging one.
[00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:41.200]   So let's talk about focus and how people can bring that
[00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:42.800]   in to kind of close this out.
[00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:46.080]   Yeah, so many of us say more than we need to say.
[00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:47.640]   Growing up, my mother had this saying.
[00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:50.320]   I know she didn't create it, but she said it all the time to me.
[00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:51.400]   And I try to live by it.
[00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:52.800]   Tell me the time.
[00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:54.720]   Don't build me the clock.
[00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:56.720]   Many of us are clock builders.
[00:49:56.720 --> 00:49:59.400]   We say more than we need to say, either
[00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:02.320]   because we want to rationalize and demonstrate the thought
[00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:05.200]   process we went through, or we want to show how smart we are.
[00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:07.000]   People just want to know the time.
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.760]   In the military, they have the notion bottom line up front.
[00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:11.680]   Tell me what's the crux of what you're saying.
[00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:13.720]   So the question becomes, how do you do that?
[00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:15.960]   Well, you do that first by reminding yourself
[00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:18.080]   of what's most relevant to the audience
[00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:19.720]   and focus your messaging on that.
[00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:22.560]   That in and of itself will make it more clear and concise.
[00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:24.880]   Also, even if it's spontaneous, you
[00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:27.360]   should think about what's my goal in this situation.
[00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:29.080]   And a goal to me has three parts.
[00:50:29.080 --> 00:50:30.320]   What do I want people to know?
[00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:31.480]   How do I want them to feel?
[00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:32.960]   And what do I want them to do?
[00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:34.080]   Know, feel, do.
[00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:36.520]   So when I go into a communication or a situation
[00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:38.880]   where I think I might be asked to be spontaneous,
[00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:41.320]   I think, what's the critical thing I want people to know?
[00:50:41.320 --> 00:50:42.480]   How do I want them to feel?
[00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:43.880]   And what do I want them to do?
[00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:46.680]   And that, again, causes me to focus my communication
[00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:47.440]   and my messaging.
[00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:50.440]   If I don't have a goal, I'm likely to say
[00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:51.760]   a lot more than I need to.
[00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:54.480]   So being focused on the needs of the audience,
[00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:57.280]   having a clear goal helps you focus your messaging.
[00:50:57.280 --> 00:51:00.640]   And then we have to prioritize what we say, the words we use.
[00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:03.920]   We often use very big words when we could use simple words.
[00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:06.400]   We often repeat ourself more than we need to.
[00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:09.480]   So we begin to train ourselves how to actually be
[00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:11.120]   more efficient in what we say.
[00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:12.720]   And here's where paraphrasing can help.
[00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:14.720]   After you read something or listen to something,
[00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:16.520]   ask yourself, what was that about?
[00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:17.400]   And truncate it.
[00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:20.040]   You're training your brain to synthesize and prioritize.
[00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:21.680]   You can look at your text messages.
[00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:23.240]   We don't think about this, but texts
[00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:25.080]   are a form of spontaneous communication.
[00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:27.000]   Many of us don't sit there for hours
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:28.240]   thinking about how to respond.
[00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:29.960]   Go back and look through all your texts
[00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:32.360]   and think, how could I have said that more efficiently using
[00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:32.680]   words?
[00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:34.800]   Obviously, using emojis changes the whole thing.
[00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:38.120]   But the point is, you can train your brain to be more efficient,
[00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:39.440]   but you have to practice at it.
[00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:41.520]   And you can practice by summarizing
[00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:43.240]   things you've heard, paraphrasing things
[00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:45.360]   you've said in the past, just as an exercise.
[00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:47.360]   I always ask people tactics and things
[00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:49.160]   that they could do while someone's waiting in line.
[00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:49.920]   Here's a great one.
[00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:52.160]   If you're waiting in line at the grocery store or something,
[00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:54.480]   you could just look through and mentally practice
[00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:56.840]   paraphrasing things you've said in the past, which
[00:51:56.840 --> 00:51:58.240]   will help you in the future.
[00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:00.440]   I would actually challenge you to go one step further.
[00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:01.840]   When you're waiting in line at the grocery store,
[00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:03.160]   there are all those magazines.
[00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:04.920]   Look at the stories of those magazines
[00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:07.320]   and just, if there's one that you know the story about,
[00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:08.200]   paraphrase it.
[00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:09.000]   So you use it.
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:10.080]   That's truly spontaneous.
[00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:12.040]   And while you're there, you could make small talk
[00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:12.960]   with the person in front of you.
[00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:15.280]   So you're practicing multiple things simultaneously.
[00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:17.480]   Paraphrase the story to the person.
[00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:17.980]   Have you--
[00:52:17.980 --> 00:52:18.400]   Oh, there you go.
[00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:19.480]   You're setting context, right?
[00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:21.120]   You could say, oh, you know this story as well.
[00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:22.520]   We've set some shared context.
[00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:23.360]   I'll paraphrase it.
[00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:25.080]   If you don't, we'll practice it all.
[00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:25.840]   That's right.
[00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:28.880]   So you're turning a grocery store into a classroom.
[00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:29.440]   I love it.
[00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:31.720]   Somehow I have a feeling that part of what you've taught
[00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:34.480]   is how to turn almost any scenario into a place
[00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:36.160]   where you can practice these tactics.
[00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:36.840]   It sounds like--
[00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:40.480]   Yeah, so much so that my two teenagers say, stop it, dad.
[00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:42.160]   There's two things that we didn't hit on
[00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:43.400]   that I want to come back to.
[00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:45.880]   So one, you briefly mentioned AI.
[00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:47.840]   And as you started saying paraphrasing,
[00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:49.800]   I was thinking, well, gosh, that seems like something
[00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:50.840]   that software does.
[00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:53.000]   Does that take away from my ability to learn?
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:55.120]   There's a browser I use called Arc.
[00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:57.520]   And now any time you hover over a link,
[00:52:57.520 --> 00:53:00.720]   the AI in the browser will just summarize the page
[00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:02.680]   before you even click on it, which is great.
[00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:06.000]   But now I'm wondering, how can any of these tools
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:07.680]   help in this process?
[00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:09.320]   Well, so I think the jury is still
[00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:11.800]   out on the impact of generative AI on communication.
[00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:13.680]   I, for one, am really interested in it.
[00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:15.880]   On the podcast I host, Think Fast, Talk Smart,
[00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:19.480]   I actually interviewed ChatGPT before it had its own voice.
[00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:22.240]   We ran its printed results through a voice synthesizer.
[00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:23.960]   And it was really interesting to hear what
[00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:25.680]   it thought about communication, at least
[00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:27.360]   in the context of spontaneous speaking,
[00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:30.640]   beyond serving up potential prompts for you to respond to.
[00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:33.560]   I think it's a good way to train our brain on how to synthesize.
[00:53:33.560 --> 00:53:36.440]   So I might speak to it or type to it something
[00:53:36.440 --> 00:53:38.040]   I might want to say, and then have
[00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:40.960]   it summarize it and paraphrase and say, oh, that's interesting.
[00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:43.000]   It's really interesting what it's indexing on
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:44.040]   and what it's focusing on.
[00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:46.920]   So it's a way of training your brain to see how it works.
[00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:48.200]   It's like a flight simulator.
[00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:50.400]   You do it and you say, oh, OK, now I look at my results
[00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:52.520]   and see how I could have been better or done worse.
[00:53:52.520 --> 00:53:55.320]   So I think AI can definitely be a tool that helps us
[00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:57.200]   in our spontaneous communication.
[00:53:57.200 --> 00:53:58.960]   Do you think it could help with structure?
[00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:00.920]   Could I say, here's a thing I'm trying to do.
[00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:02.360]   Could you give me more structure?
[00:54:02.360 --> 00:54:04.120]   I'm right now thinking about how I might
[00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:05.760]   implore some of these lessons.
[00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:07.280]   I have actually tested that out.
[00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:09.520]   I taught ChatGPT what, so what, now what.
[00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:12.080]   And then I typed in a paragraph, and I said, give this to me
[00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:13.200]   in what, so what, now what.
[00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:14.400]   And it did a pretty good job.
[00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:16.480]   It wasn't perfect, but yeah, you can do that.
[00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:17.480]   And then you can see it.
[00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:19.920]   I'm using this as a teacher in my classes.
[00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:21.520]   I love to give students examples.
[00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:23.640]   I hope you've noticed that I try to give lots of examples
[00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:24.240]   when I teach.
[00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:25.720]   And so I like to give them examples.
[00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:28.280]   But it takes time, especially when they're written examples.
[00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:30.000]   So I'll actually use generative AI.
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:32.320]   I'll give it a few examples and say, create a couple others
[00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:33.360]   with these variations.
[00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:35.720]   So I go from having three to now nine.
[00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:38.400]   And now my students see lots of different options.
[00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:40.600]   So there are ways that it can help, certainly.
[00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:42.680]   And then one other one, which is a total aside,
[00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:44.680]   is around filler words.
[00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:47.600]   And I'm curious, as someone who actually
[00:54:47.600 --> 00:54:50.000]   looks at transcripts of my own conversation
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:53.320]   and sees the usage of um, you know, like, that's up,
[00:54:53.320 --> 00:54:56.800]   any thoughts on how to remove them or reduce them
[00:54:56.800 --> 00:54:58.320]   in your vocabulary?
[00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:00.440]   So the first and most important is awareness.
[00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:02.400]   You can't change something you're not aware of.
[00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:04.400]   And there are actually tools that can help you.
[00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:06.120]   There are apps you can get on your phone.
[00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:08.840]   One I like a lot is called Like So.
[00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:11.160]   And what it does is it activates your phone's microphone
[00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:12.000]   when you turn it on.
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:14.560]   You can code in what words you want it to listen to.
[00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:18.520]   And then it vibrates, bings, or beeps every time you say one.
[00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:19.720]   So then you're aware of it.
[00:55:19.720 --> 00:55:20.960]   And you can look for patterns.
[00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:23.000]   There's another tool that plugs into your browser
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:26.760]   for any virtual tool like Zoom, Meet, WebEx, et cetera.
[00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:29.080]   And it only records your voice, not the other voices.
[00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:30.960]   And it'll highlight when you say it.
[00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:32.480]   So you can look for patterns.
[00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:34.800]   For example, I worked with somebody just the other day.
[00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:37.880]   And we saw that before he says a complex technical term,
[00:55:37.880 --> 00:55:39.360]   he will typically say um.
[00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:41.880]   I didn't notice that as somebody who just listens to him.
[00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:43.000]   I just heard a lot of ums.
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:44.720]   But the tool helped me see a pattern.
[00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:47.560]   And now he knows every time before he says a technical term
[00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:48.480]   to be more vigilant.
[00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:50.640]   And he's reduced the number of ums considerably.
[00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:53.320]   So awareness building is one of the best ways to do it.
[00:55:53.320 --> 00:55:54.680]   And here's an example of where I think
[00:55:54.680 --> 00:55:56.320]   technology really can help.
[00:55:56.320 --> 00:55:58.240]   - And what was the browser tool or the--
[00:55:58.240 --> 00:56:02.240]   - Oh, it's called poised.com, P-O-I-S-E-D.com.
[00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:03.080]   - Oh, wow.
[00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:04.200]   I'm so glad I asked that question.
[00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:05.760]   I didn't know these tools existed.
[00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:06.760]   I'm gonna check them out.
[00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:07.680]   This has been so great.
[00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:11.160]   I feel like I have a whole list of things to go practice.
[00:56:11.160 --> 00:56:12.840]   I'm gonna go back and re-listen to this
[00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:15.560]   because I did try my best to both stay present
[00:56:15.560 --> 00:56:16.560]   and not take notes.
[00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:17.760]   But now I wish I have.
[00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:20.960]   Where can people get more and go deeper?
[00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:21.800]   - Well, thank you.
[00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:23.520]   So first and foremost, I encourage people to listen
[00:56:23.520 --> 00:56:24.680]   to Think Fast, Talk Smart.
[00:56:24.680 --> 00:56:26.800]   It's a podcast all about communication.
[00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:28.400]   Short form, 20 minutes.
[00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:30.480]   Lots of information I think will help people.
[00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:33.200]   mattabrahams.com, great place to go.
[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:34.240]   All of my resources.
[00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:36.680]   I have a ton of free stuff out there to help people.
[00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:38.080]   I'm a big user of LinkedIn.
[00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:39.840]   Would love to connect with people that way.
[00:56:39.840 --> 00:56:41.720]   I really appreciate Chris, the conversation.
[00:56:41.720 --> 00:56:42.920]   I loved your comments
[00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:45.520]   and I'm going to borrow your budgeting example.
[00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:46.360]   Thank you.
[00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:47.320]   - You're welcome to have it.
[00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:48.480]   It is not trademarked.
[00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:50.160]   Thank you so much for joining me.
[00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:51.000]   - Thank you.
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:54.480]   - Wow, that is definitely one of the episodes
[00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:57.880]   where I know I'm gonna be going back and listening myself,
[00:56:57.880 --> 00:56:59.800]   taking notes so that I can put a lot
[00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:01.640]   of what we discussed into practice.
[00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:03.360]   Thank you so much for listening.
[00:57:03.360 --> 00:57:05.520]   I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did.
[00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:08.000]   Next week, I've got a whole episode dedicated
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:09.240]   to open enrollment.
[00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:10.160]   So if that's something
[00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:11.920]   that you happen to be going through already
[00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:14.400]   and you wanna hold off on Wednesday,
[00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:16.400]   I'm gonna go through everything that I know,
[00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:19.360]   covering all kinds of plans, terminology, how to pick,
[00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:21.600]   how to think about the entire process.
[00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:23.200]   So stay tuned for that.
[00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:26.880]   And if you need to get in touch, podcast@allthehacks.com.
[00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:28.320]   Thank you so much for listening.
[00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:29.560]   I will see you next week.
[00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:32.200]   (upbeat music)
[00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:34.560]   (whooshing)
[00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:37.300]   (birds chirping)
