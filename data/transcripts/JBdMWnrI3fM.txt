[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520]   Let me quickly say that I've been a fan of the Jerry podcast since it first started 10 years ago.
[00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.840]   Joe's open-mindedness and just genuine curiosity was a breath of fresh air,
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.280]   especially to me as a scientist, but in general as a thinking person.
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.760]   He inspired me to be a better and especially kinder human being.
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.720]   So it was surreal for me to be on there a couple of times last year,
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.760]   and I'll be on there again a third time on February 3rd.
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.400]   It feels like I'm Forrest Gump somehow finding myself shaking hands with John F. Kennedy.
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.360]   Anyway, I also enjoy playing guitar,
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.760]   and I thought I'd play the intro theme plus a bit more to say thank you for the 10 years of Jerry.
[00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:49.080]   As a wise man once said, "Train by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day."
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.080]   Thank you.
