[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240]   - You don't drink alcohol, correct?
[00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:05.760]   - Correct.
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.880]   - Have you ever had a sip of alcohol?
[00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.880]   - I had, I drank alcohol once as part of a class experiment
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:19.320]   and had to mix all these drinks and taste them.
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.260]   And it was a terrible experience,
[00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.680]   but it was a requirement in the class I was taking.
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.360]   - Wow, school was different back then.
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.200]   - Yeah.
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.240]   - I think school was different.
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.240]   I think school was different.
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.560]   We used to prick our fingers and do our own blood tests
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.400]   in science class.
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.240]   - I remember that, I never did it
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.640]   'cause I was always needle phobic,
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.200]   but that was definitely something
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.920]   that was asked of us to do.
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.920]   - Yeah, you could never get away with that now
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.420]   in a high school classroom.
[00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.080]   The reason I ask about alcohol is,
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.120]   first of all, I'm not the anti-alcohol crusader,
[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.560]   even though I did an episode about alcohol,
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.320]   which discouraged many people from drinking more of it.
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.460]   But I think for a lot of people,
[00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.320]   the idea of smoking cannabis, drinking alcohol,
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.520]   for them in their mind is synonymous
[00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.200]   with the creative process, especially music,
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.700]   for a lot of reasons that people can imagine.
[00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.680]   I think it's remarkable and impressive
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.960]   and worth spending a few moments with you sharing with us,
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.760]   how is it that you were around all of that?
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.960]   You're clearly part of the crew,
[00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.640]   meaning you're part of the creative process.
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.880]   Presumably people offered you alcohol, drugs, et cetera,
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.720]   but something in you seems like resistant
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:35.960]   to any kind of peer pressure.
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.000]   And as an adult, that's impressive,
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.660]   but to think like when I was 15, 16, sure,
[00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.600]   sort of regret it, but yeah, I drank,
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.760]   I had my experiences and then eventually stopped that.
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.280]   But most people are not good at not drinking
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.100]   if they don't want to drink ever,
[00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.860]   or just once from a high school class.
[00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.420]   What was the internal narrative in your mind
[00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.140]   when that stuff was around?
[00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.600]   And what allowed you to just say,
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.000]   no, I'm gonna, I belong here, but I'm not gonna do that.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.620]   - It just was never interesting to me.
[00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.620]   And I think maybe it had to do with being an only child.
[00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.740]   I'd never, being an only child,
[00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.620]   I think made me less resistant to peer pressure
[00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.620]   because I felt more confident in who I was,
[00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.780]   whatever that was, just from being with myself
[00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.500]   and not with other siblings.
[00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.460]   I'm guessing, I don't know if that's right,
[00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.220]   but that's my first inclination
[00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.980]   is to guess that would be the case.
[00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.180]   Also, I've always known what I like
[00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.460]   and known what I don't like
[00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.840]   and know there are things I want to try,
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.220]   there are things I don't want to try.
[00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.740]   And I feel very good about not doing something
[00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.180]   I don't want to do.
[00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.280]   I feel great about it.
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.300]   - Have you ever been curious about psychedelics,
[00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.840]   given that- - I'm very curious.
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.620]   I've never done it, but I'm very curious.
[00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.700]   And I've been curious for a long time.
[00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.420]   There may be a time when I experiment.
[00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.420]   - Yeah, there are two psychedelics in particular
[00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.740]   that I find really interesting.
[00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.740]   One is macrodosilocybin,
[00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.180]   which I've done as part of a clinical trial.
[00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.700]   And my understanding is it reveals
[00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.700]   in a very intense and experiential way
[00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.200]   some component of the unconscious mind.
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.500]   And it allows for plasticity
[00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.220]   and rewiring of the brain that's permanent
[00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.500]   if you come to some understanding
[00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:30.940]   through the so-called integration.
[00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.020]   It's not without its risks.
[00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.260]   The other one that's really interesting
[00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:34.820]   that I've been hearing more about,
[00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.540]   and I have not tried,
[00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.060]   and it carries some dangers is ibogaine,
[00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.260]   which is 22 hours long.
[00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.100]   And people experience the world as normal
[00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.940]   with their eyes open, but when they close their eyes,
[00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.260]   they get a high-resolution movie-like version
[00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.140]   of prior experiences,
[00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.180]   but they have agency within those movies.
[00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.900]   They can reshape their reactions.
[00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.180]   This is being used to treat PTSD in veterans
[00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.660]   to great success.
[00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.260]   It has some cardiac risk associated with it,
[00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.300]   and it's not legal in the United States,
[00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.420]   and it's not being explored in clinical trials yet.
[00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.640]   But the state of Kentucky recently took,
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.640]   I think it's $40 million from the OxyContin settlement,
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.560]   and it's putting it to ibogaine research.
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.400]   - Interesting.
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.120]   - Yeah, so those are the two that kind of spring to mind,
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.520]   you know, kind of the classic psychedelic experience.
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.520]   - I've also heard good things about MDMA,
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.600]   but I've never done that.
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.920]   - Yeah, I have done MDMA as part,
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.280]   again, as part of a therapeutic trial.
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.140]   It's a strong empathogen.
[00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:41.480]   The danger with MDMA, I think,
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:46.040]   is that if you don't stay in the eye mask,
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.640]   or if you're listening to music or something,
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.800]   you can easily get anchored to some external cue
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.000]   and like see a plant and be like, "I love plants,"
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.560]   and spend the whole four to six hours
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.880]   thinking about your love of plants,
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.440]   which might be valuable.
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.600]   But I think the strong introspective work
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.280]   is best done with a therapist there
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.560]   and you in the eye mask,
[00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.160]   and occasionally leaving the eye mask
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.560]   and writing things down.
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.600]   So, you know, the reason I put that detail in there
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.320]   is that the psychedelic experience
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.460]   is very different with eyes open versus in the eye mask,
[00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.360]   with a clinician there versus recreationally.
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.080]   And it's not just about dangers versus safety.
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.760]   It's also about, like, it's a big investment
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.740]   and what one stands to get out of it,
[00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.840]   I think depends on how much introspection
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.400]   you're willing to do.
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.200]   We won't be doing it this afternoon.
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.820]   (upbeat music)
[00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.240]   (upbeat music)
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.980]   (upbeat music)
