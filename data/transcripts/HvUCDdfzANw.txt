[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.120]   - As we get into adulthood,
[00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:05.900]   most of our neural maps in the brain,
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.840]   certainly our sensory maps and our cortex,
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.700]   our motor maps that allow us to move in particular ways,
[00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.120]   those have been established.
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.760]   You can still change them,
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.480]   but they've mostly been established
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.600]   throughout childhood and into our early 20s.
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.580]   And if we want to modify those circuits with neuroplasticity,
[00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:22.900]   there are a couple of key requirements.
[00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.740]   One, you need to be alert.
[00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.200]   You can't get neuroplasticity.
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.640]   That is, you can't trigger neuroplasticity
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:29.600]   unless you're alert.
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.060]   You also have to be focused.
[00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.780]   This is critical and differentiates adult plasticity
[00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.100]   in a major way from plasticity when we're young,
[00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.320]   where we can learn by passive exposure, okay?
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.120]   When we're young, we can learn by passive exposure
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.780]   or even better by focused exposure.
[00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:44.880]   But when we are adults,
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.260]   we need alertness and we need focus.
[00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.380]   Just passively being exposed to music or to motor pattern
[00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.440]   is not going to allow us to change our nervous system.
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.080]   That's been shown over and over again.
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.200]   Fortunately, what also has been shown over and over again
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.620]   is that if we are alert and we're focused
[00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.720]   and we are determined,
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.120]   especially if we undertake what's called incremental learning,
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.920]   where we go after small bits of neuroplasticity
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.540]   repeatedly over time,
[00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.680]   we can get as much neuroplasticity
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.540]   as one observes in childhood.
[00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.380]   It just takes longer and you have to do it
[00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.680]   so-called incrementally.
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.440]   There's a lot to say about that,
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.260]   but for sake of today's discussion about the vagus nerve,
[00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.680]   I just want to tell you that there's a particular pathway
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.600]   in the brain that involves the molecule acetylcholine.
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.480]   Acetylcholine is used to contract the muscles.
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.520]   It's released from motor neurons in the spinal cord onto muscles
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.700]   to contract the muscles.
[00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.500]   It's also used in the brain and elsewhere in the nervous system,
[00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.880]   and it does a lot of different things.
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.020]   It's actually involved in generating the rhythms of the heart,
[00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.360]   but acetylcholine released from a particular nucleus
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.760]   in the brain called nucleus basalis.
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.620]   The acetylcholine released from nucleus basalis
[00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.520]   is what we call permissive for plasticity.
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.920]   In other words, if you have acetylcholine released
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.180]   from nucleus basalis into the brain,
[00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.140]   plasticity is much more likely to occur.
[00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.900]   And in fact, acetylcholine released from nucleus basalis
[00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.360]   is sort of like a gate whereby if you release acetylcholine,
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.040]   the opportunity for neuroplasticity and learning
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.160]   is available for some period of time.
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.580]   So the question therefore becomes,
[00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.320]   how do you get acetylcholine released from nucleus basalis?
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.740]   There are these incredible experiments
[00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.680]   that have been done by Mike Merzenich and colleagues
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.920]   showing that if you stimulate nucleus basalis
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.100]   to release acetylcholine and you expose an animal or a human
[00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.740]   to a particular sensory stimulus,
[00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.460]   the brain remaps very fast according to that experience,
[00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.260]   just enormous amounts of plasticity
[00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.080]   that you wouldn't observe otherwise.
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.480]   There are also fortunately experiments showing
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.880]   that if you pharmacologically increase acetylcholine,
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.760]   that you can enhance the opportunity for neuroplasticity.
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.540]   You still need to do the learning.
[00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.020]   You still need to attempt to learn something.
[00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.720]   You still have to make it incremental,
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.100]   but the amount of plasticity is significantly increased
[00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.360]   when there's acetylcholine released from nucleus basalis.
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.860]   So in the absence of deep brain stimulation using an electrode,
[00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.500]   which most of you fortunately will not experience
[00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.440]   because it requires drilling down through the skull
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.960]   and placing an electrode in basalis,
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.060]   and assuming that you're not taking anything
[00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.400]   to increase acetylcholine transmission to learn,
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.860]   although there are ways to do that,
[00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.420]   I've talked about that before,
[00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.220]   and I'll talk about that again in a future podcast.
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.080]   Some of those ways include supplementing with things
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.780]   like alpha GPC, which is a precursor to acetylcholine.
[00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.740]   There are some other precursors to acetylcholine
[00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.000]   or things that stimulate the release of acetylcholine,
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.020]   such as huperzine and things like that,
[00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.680]   that will open the opportunity for enhanced plasticity
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.040]   for a few hours.
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.200]   And there is good old nicotine.
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.020]   I know the word nicotine brings to mind things like lung cancer,
[00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.580]   because for many, many years, many, many people,
[00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.260]   and still now smoked nicotine in the form of cigarettes,
[00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.580]   or vaping, both of which I think are absolutely terrible,
[00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:51.940]   as is dipping and snuffing,
[00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.380]   because yes, they increase levels
[00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.300]   of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor activation,
[00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.140]   which is just fancy nerd speak
[00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.340]   for acetylcholine transmission in the brain
[00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:02.960]   is enhanced by nicotine,
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.660]   but those delivery mechanisms also, of course,
[00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.640]   can give you cancer in the case of smoking,
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:08.940]   dipping or snuffing,
[00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.140]   and vaping, despite what you hear out there,
[00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.840]   is absolutely terrible for your health.
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.040]   I don't care what anybody says,
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.460]   the evidence is starting to really pile up
[00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:18.840]   that vaping is bad for you.
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.340]   Now, is oral form nicotine bad for you
[00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.140]   in the form of gum or in the form of a pouch, etc.?
[00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.620]   I just want to say a couple of things.
[00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.220]   One, it's extremely habit-forming.
[00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.420]   Two, it increases blood pressure,
[00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.280]   and it's a vasoconstrictor.
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.780]   These drawbacks about nicotine are real
[00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.540]   and are critical to consider
[00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.760]   if you're going to use nicotine as a focusing agent
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.300]   or a so-called nootropic.
[00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:43.680]   I don't really like that word,
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.000]   but if you're using nicotine as a way
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.860]   to enhance cognition and enhance neuroplasticity,
[00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.080]   you should know what the potential drawbacks are,
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.080]   most notably the habit-forming and addicting properties,
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.480]   which are very robust.
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.720]   Now, with that said,
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.380]   there are ways to non-pharmacologically stimulate
[00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.020]   the nucleus basalis acetylcholine pathway
[00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.180]   to enhance the window for plasticity.
[00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.840]   And the way to do that is,
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:07.740]   you guessed it,
[00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.080]   through the vagus nerve.
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.500]   Studies in healthy humans and humans
[00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:12.920]   who have had, for instance, stroke,
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.960]   as well as animal studies have shown
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.360]   that if you stimulate the vagus nerve electrically,
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.240]   you increase the level of alertness in the brain,
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.360]   and part of the mechanism by which you do that
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.980]   is the one I told you about a few minutes ago,
[00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.860]   the adrenals, vagus, locus coeruleus,
[00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.060]   but also there's a separate pathway
[00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.760]   from the NTS to nucleus basalis
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.080]   that stimulates the release of acetylcholine
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.260]   from nucleus basalis
[00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.380]   and opens up the opportunity for neuroplasticity.
[00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:42.100]   This, I should mention, is not a small effect.
[00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.640]   It is a rapid effect,
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.340]   and it's one that has allowed stroke patients, for instance,
[00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.200]   to improve their motor capabilities very quickly
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.240]   as compared to when the vagus nerve is not stimulated
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.160]   or when acetylcholine transmission
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.860]   is not enhanced pharmacologically.
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.360]   And fortunately, now, there are studies
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.420]   starting to accumulate in animal models
[00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:02.800]   and some in humans.
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.380]   We need more, but there are some showing
[00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.520]   that if you enhance alertness
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.920]   by way of activating the vagus nerve
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.180]   through the mechanism that I told you before,
[00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.960]   which is good old-fashioned high-intensity exercise,
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.240]   that in the several hours following that exercise,
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.860]   there is an enhanced opportunity for neuroplasticity.
[00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.760]   Now, that enhanced opportunity for neuroplasticity
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.980]   comes by way of two different pathways.
[00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:28.420]   You already heard about the first one,
[00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:31.340]   which is the locus coeruleus release of norepinephrine.
[00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.280]   That's going to increase alertness,
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:35.380]   which is a prerequisite for focus.
[00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:37.140]   And it appears to be the case
[00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:39.800]   that the release of acetylcholine from nucleus basalis
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:43.100]   that's also triggered by this high-intensity exercise
[00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:48.180]   is what allows for that alertness to be converted into focus.
[00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:49.380]   And those two things together,
[00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:50.540]   alertness and focus,
[00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:53.520]   are the triggers for adult neuroplasticity.
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:54.640]   If you think about this,
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:55.840]   this is really exciting.
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.640]   For 25 years or more,
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.700]   we've known that plasticity is possible in the adult human.
[00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.360]   We knew you needed alertness and you needed focus.
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.520]   We also, by the way,
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.480]   know that you need to get great sleep that night
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:08.800]   and in subsequent nights
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.400]   in order to actually allow the plasticity to occur.
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.120]   Plasticity is a process.
[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:13.960]   It's not just triggered
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:15.720]   when you go about trying to learn something.
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.820]   It actually takes place in sleep,
[00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:19.640]   as well as sleep-like states
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.560]   like non-sleep deep rest and meditation,
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.680]   but especially in deep sleep
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:24.920]   and rapid eye movement sleep.
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.060]   This is why you can attempt
[00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:28.100]   to learn something cognitively or behaviorally
[00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:29.760]   over and over and over.
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.620]   You can't get those scales on the piano right.
[00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:33.500]   You can't get the, you know,
[00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.220]   the information dialed in from your class,
[00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.280]   a language class or from engineering
[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.040]   or you're trying to figure out
[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:41.780]   what this picture should be in your mind
[00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:42.900]   that you're going to paint, et cetera.
[00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:45.800]   You work at it, you work at it, you work at it,
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:46.700]   you sleep, you sleep,
[00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:47.700]   and then one day you wake up
[00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:48.860]   and suddenly you have the skill.
[00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:51.660]   It's because the actual rewiring of those circuits
[00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:53.900]   that we call neuroplasticity occurs during sleep,
[00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:55.780]   but it's triggered in those moments
[00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:58.200]   of incremental learning and really struggling.
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:00.360]   And keep in mind the struggle to learn something,
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:03.660]   that friction is part of the neuroplasticity process.
[00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:08.300]   And it's oh so clear now that alertness and focus
[00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:10.300]   are the prerequisites for plasticity,
[00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:13.140]   that alertness is coming in large part
[00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:14.700]   by way of the release of norepinephrine
[00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:16.000]   from locus coeruleus,
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.060]   that the focus is being augmented
[00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:21.000]   and perhaps it's even originating entirely
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.500]   from the release of acetylcholine and nucleus basalis
[00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:25.060]   that acts as sort of a spotlight
[00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:27.100]   on a particular set of things that are happening
[00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:28.420]   while we're trying to learn.
[00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:31.540]   and then that triggers the plasticity process,
[00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:33.580]   which takes place during sleep.
[00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:35.880]   So that beautiful picture
[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:38.600]   of self-directed adaptive plasticity in adulthood
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:41.580]   is allowed to happen
[00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:44.840]   because the vagus nerve in part
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:48.400]   is triggering NTS to say,
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.900]   hey, locus coeruleus, nucleus basalis,
[00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:52.780]   wake up, release norepinephrine,
[00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:54.240]   release acetylcholine,
[00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:55.680]   now's the time to learn.
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.700]   So what this means is if you're struggling to learn,
[00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:01.640]   if you want to continue to have robust neuroplasticity,
[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:04.780]   if you happen to have some damage to motor pathways
[00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:07.220]   or you're having trouble with focusing and brain fog,
[00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:10.980]   keep in mind, focus itself is served by a circuit
[00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:12.560]   that is subject to plasticity.
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.260]   You can actually get better at focusing
[00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:18.100]   by working on focus just the same way you would on any skill.
[00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:20.520]   And so if you're struggling with focus,
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:23.100]   I highly recommend finding a threshold of exercise
[00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:25.340]   that stimulates brain alertness,
[00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:27.220]   that triggers these pathways
[00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:29.000]   that are now starting to be clear
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.320]   that they occur from the literature in animals and humans.
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:34.800]   And yes, you might augment this
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.100]   with something like caffeine,
[00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:38.700]   which will further increase levels of norepinephrine.
[00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:40.720]   You might even use low dose nicotine.
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.220]   I'm not necessarily recommending that,
[00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:43.440]   certainly not for young people.
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:46.300]   And you do need to be aware of the habit forming,
[00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:48.140]   AKA addictive properties of nicotine.
[00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:50.320]   You definitely don't want to consume it in any form
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:53.260]   that's going to cause you to increase your risk of cancer
[00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:54.880]   or popcorn lung from vaping.
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:56.620]   You could use pharmacology.
[00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:57.960]   You could use alpha GPC.
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:01.160]   You could use herpruzine in combination with exercise.
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:04.180]   However, I strongly, strongly recommend
[00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:06.680]   that anyone who's interested in lifelong learning,
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:09.060]   think about organizing your bouts of learning,
[00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:10.200]   especially cognitive learning,
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.820]   to come in the two to three hours,
[00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:13.900]   maybe even four hours,
[00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:15.420]   but certainly in the one to two hours
[00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:17.280]   after you do some sort of exercise
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:18.880]   that doesn't leave you exhausted,
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:22.880]   but leaves you with elevated levels of energy in your body.
[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:25.460]   So you don't want to take this physical exercise
[00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:27.200]   that I'm talking about to exhaustion
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.040]   because that's going to leave you depleted.
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.680]   That's going to cause a, you know,
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:32.760]   uptick in parasympathetic activity.
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:35.040]   Any of you that have done a hard leg workout,
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.780]   and then, you know, two, three hours later,
[00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:38.400]   you're just like, it's very clear.
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:40.080]   Brain oxygen levels are down,
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.040]   parasympathetic activity is up.
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:43.520]   You are tired because you exhausted
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:44.840]   all that energy and exercise.
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:47.360]   But if you can use exercise as a trigger
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:50.060]   to release adrenaline and stimulate these pathways
[00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:52.540]   within the brain that arrive via the signaling
[00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:53.300]   from the vagus,
[00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:55.560]   you do indeed open up the opportunity
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:58.860]   for enhanced neuroplasticity at any age.
[00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:07.040]   So,
