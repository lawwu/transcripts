[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920]   This is the most important learning from this experience. Forget about the fiduciary and the
[00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.440]   governance responsibility of these companies, whether they were good or bad will be resolved
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.600]   over the next couple of weeks and months, I'm sure, as more information comes to light.
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.840]   But what's super interesting about what happened this week, and I think is the most impactful
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:23.600]   societally over time, is that we're seeing this phenomena where individuals in aggregate
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:30.880]   can believe something to be true and make it true. And we saw this with Tesla. And I don't think
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:38.240]   Tesla got this level of notoriety because it was such a longer play out cycle. But Elon was not
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.880]   hitting numbers that people thought he was going to hit, margins, production volume, etc. People
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.600]   were shorting the stock. But enough people believed in the story that Elon told about what
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.840]   he wanted the future to look like, that they bought the stock, and that gave him the ability
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.600]   to do shelf offerings, raise additional.
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.400]   capital and ultimately build the business and make it manifest in reality that he said would
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:05.280]   happen. And the same is true of Bitcoin. And the same is true of Trump. And the same is true of
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.400]   storming the capital. In all of these cases, there was a belief in something. And there was an
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:17.200]   aggregation of individuals using social media as a mechanism for sharing and talking and engaging and
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.920]   creating a collective outcome that wouldn't have happened through a centralized system or a
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.960]   centralized process, and wouldn't have happened in the traditional way where history defines the
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.760]   future. And I think that is what's so powerful about what's happening right now. And we're
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.600]   seeing it in financial markets, but we're also seeing it play out in politics. And we're seeing
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:43.200]   it play out in the real world in a remarkable way. And it goes back to this notion that like a stock
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.040]   is worth the underlying value of the company. And that's not true.
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.840]   People can dream a stock to be anything as they did with Tesla at the time that people were buying
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:58.080]   Tesla stock. The historical performance of that business was not what hedge funds considered to be
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.920]   a profitable, good business. It shouldn't be worth anything. But the belief in what it could be is
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.480]   what drove the value of that stock. And ultimately, that value enabled that business to become true.
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:14.720]   And it's amazing to see it happening. And I think the counter, which is really what makes this so
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.320]   striking, is the centralized institutions that are trying to block this from happening. And the
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.760]   shutting down of Parler, which is a big part of the problem, is that it's a big problem. And it's a
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.560]   big problem. And the shutting down of Robinhood Trading are equivalent, from my point of view,
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.240]   or at least equivalent, I think will be perceived to be equivalent broadly, which is if a group of
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.600]   people get together and try and use an online service to make a change in the world by sharing
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.840]   and talking with one another and communicating a belief, a collective belief, and that gets yanked
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.640]   away from them, that institution that has the ability to yank it away from them is evil. And
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.680]   it will force people to decentralize and it will enable new ways of trading, new ways of communicating
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.240]   and new ways of building. And that's the profound change that I think this decade is going to
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.960]   realize. And we're just seeing it start now. We talked about decentralization. And, you know,
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.600]   we all feel the emotional response to the little guy getting screwed by the big guy that controls
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.080]   the system. And we want to fight the system. That's the basis of every great movie. It's worth
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:15.280]   highlighting, though, that decentralization and what I would kind of characterize as swarming
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.400]   behavior, uncontrolled swarming behavior, can actually have negative consequences. And there's
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.600]   a reason systems are so much more efficient than they were in the early 2000s. And that's because
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.720]   exist. You know, when you put a bunch of people in a room, let's say you put 100 people in a room
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.080]   and every time and someone says the word door, and every time you hear the word door, you're
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:35.140]   supposed to repeat it. Within 30 seconds, the entire room will be like deafening with everyone
[00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.400]   screaming door, door, door, and suddenly everyone will be screaming it. That's a feedback loop that
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.020]   occurs in an uncontrolled social system. And that's what's occurred with GameStop. And it's
[00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:49.340]   what occurred with with with Bitcoin. So there are, as we've seen, remarkable outcomes when you
[00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.200]   allow systems to operate without centralized control, and without centralized brake pads,
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.880]   that kind of slow them down or put in place some rules and some obligations to how that system
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:05.460]   operates. The problem with decentralization, and this swarming approach to resolution,
[00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:10.360]   where lots of people basically work together individually, is you end up with things like
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.840]   cancel culture, where before a judge and jury determines whether or not someone did something
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.320]   wrong, the community decides that person should be punished and shouldn't.
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.760]   And then the system shuts them down in the real world and their career and their life is ended and ruined.
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:30.540]   And we saw the same and we saw the same with the Capitol riots, you know, people basically died
[00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:36.000]   because of the swarm that occurred, where this idea that there was fraud in the election became an
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:43.200]   echoing, deafening noise for these people, and they swarmed and killed people. And the system by which
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.520]   you can actually have vigorous debate, and the system by which you can actually have controls and
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:54.480]   processes and judges and juries and trials, is what needs to be improved for this to work. Otherwise,
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:05:00.000]   people will go to decentralization, and you will have a Lord of the Flies moment that engulfs civil
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.960]   society, because the tools are there today. And so centralized systems can work, but they have to
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:13.260]   adapt and adapt quickly to be fair and to enable and to not discriminate. Otherwise, we're gonna
[00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:17.340]   see Lord of the Flies, and we're gonna see decentralization being the solution to getting out
[00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.780]   system that's inhibiting us and we're going to end up having really fucking ugly outcomes.
