[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.520]   the number of countries with nuclear weapons has not gone up for decades. Is it surprising?
[00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.640]   In the '50s, a lot of countries that you would never have imagined were working on nuclear
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:15.040]   weapons. Sweden, Norway, Japan, South Korea, a lot of countries, they had the technology,
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.440]   they just didn't have the materials. And it was dicey about what you should do.
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.240]   I interviewed some of the Swedish scientists who worked on their bomb. And I said,
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.320]   "So why did you give it up?" They said, "When the Soviets developed hydrogen bombs,
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.440]   it would only take two to destroy Sweden." So we didn't see much point. And we signed
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.240]   then the Non-Proliferation Treaty, they said. And our knowledge of how to build nuclear weapons
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:44.160]   helped us deal with countries like South Africa, which did build a few bombs in the late 1980s.
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.960]   So efforts were starting up. And that's where John Kennedy got the numbers where he said,
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.640]   "I lose sleep at night" over the real prospect of there being 10 countries with nuclear weapons
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.560]   by 1970 and 30 by 1980. And of course, that would have been a nightmare world because the risk of
[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.920]   somebody using them would have gone up accordingly. But after the Cuban Missile Crisis, we and the
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.080]   Soviet Union basically said, "We've got to slow this thing down." And the treaty that was then
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.680]   put together and negotiated offered a good deal. It said, "If you don't build nuclear weapons,
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.200]   we will give you the knowledge to build nuclear energy technology." There was a belief in the
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.000]   early years of nuclear weapons that as soon as the technology was learned by a country,
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.440]   they would immediately proceed to build the bomb. No one really thought it through. It
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.200]   seems self-evident, but it wasn't self-evident. There are dangers to building a nuclear weapon
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.040]   and having an arsenal. If you're a little country and you have a nuclear arsenal, you have the
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.920]   potential to destroy a large country, or at least disable a large country, because you have these
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.000]   terribly destructive weapons. That makes you a target. That means that large country is going
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.280]   to look at you and worry about you, which they never would have before. That kind of logic
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.280]   dawned on everybody at that point, and they were getting a good deal. And the other part of the
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.080]   deal was the part that the nuclear powers never kept to this day, which was an agreement that
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:09.840]   we would work seriously and vigorously toward nuclear disarmament. We didn't do that. We just
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.800]   told them we would, and then snuck around on the sides. So much so that this treaty, no one was
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.360]   quite trusting of the whole deal. Treaties are usually signed, and they exist in perpetuity.
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.760]   They don't have any end date. They go on until somebody breaks the rules. But this treaty was
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.920]   given a 25-year review period, which would have been 1995, at which point, if the countries had
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.840]   chosen to abrogate the treaty, it would have been set aside, and everybody could have gone back to
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.520]   making nuclear weapons. Now, it almost came to that for the very reason that the main nuclear
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.480]   powers had not fulfilled their agreement to start reducing arsenals. We didn't start reducing our
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.000]   nuclear arsenal until the end of the Cold War, until the collapse of the Soviet Union. That's
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.480]   when we began cutting back, as did the former Soviet Union. A diplomat who's a friend of mine,
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.360]   Tom Graham, was assigned the task by our State Department of going around to the countries that
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.560]   were going to be voting on this renewal or not of the treaty, and convincing their leaderships
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.040]   around the world that it wasn't in their best interest to abrogate the treaty at that point.
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.920]   Tom spent two years on the road. The only place he thought he should go is not the UN,
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.480]   where there's a second-level diplomat he could have talked to, but back to the home countries,
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.440]   and he convinced enough countries around the world. He's another hero who's never been properly
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.920]   celebrated. He convinced enough countries around the world that they did agree to extend the treaty
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.760]   in perpetuity, with the proviso that the goddamn nine nuclear powers get busy eliminating their
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.200]   nukes. Of course, George H.W. Bush, bless him, I didn't like his politics otherwise, but he stepped
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.680]   forward and split the nuclear arsenal in half right away. We dropped our numbers way lower
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.840]   than we had been. He pulled them out of South Korea, which was a great bugaboo for both the
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.600]   Soviets and the North Koreans, and China, and did a lot of good work toward moving toward a real
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.520]   reduction in nuclear arsenals, and the Russians agreed at that time. It was before Putin took
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:00.080]   power. So there was a change for the better, but there are still too many around, unfortunately.
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.880]   So that's why there are only nine nuclear powers to this day.
