[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.380]   - We start the week with a question from a listener,
[00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.440]   Rob, who writes in to ask this.
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.020]   Pastor John, as a Reformed Calvinist,
[00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:13.780]   I highly appreciate Jonathan Edwards,
[00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.720]   who claims that number one,
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.220]   free will is doing what we desire,
[00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.600]   but that two, God gives us the desire to do good.
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.360]   And with that being said, and keeping James 1:13 in mind,
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.600]   I'm having trouble understanding where Lucifer
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.600]   received his first desire for sin.
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.480]   Norman Geisler says, quote,
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.280]   "The unmistakable logical conclusion
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.240]   for the extreme Calvinist is that both Lucifer and Adam
[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.240]   sinned because God gave them the desire to sin first."
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.560]   End quote.
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.360]   I would imagine that Adam received his desire to sin
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.400]   from Eve, who received it from the serpent, from Satan.
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.020]   But if God is sovereign over all things,
[00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.840]   including all of our desires,
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.700]   would that make him the initial author
[00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.680]   of the first desire for sin in Satan?
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.240]   How do you answer this mystery?
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.440]   - For as many years as I can remember,
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:16.300]   I have said that among the mysteries in my theology,
[00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.540]   for which I do not have an adequate answer,
[00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.720]   one of them is the question, how?
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.600]   How is a key word here.
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.960]   How did the first sin come about?
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.000]   And by first sin, I don't mean Adam's first sin.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.960]   I mean Satan's first sin,
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.920]   the very first sin in the universe.
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.540]   The Bible opens not with the beginning of evil,
[00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.080]   but with the presence of unexplained evil.
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.580]   Man is created innocent,
[00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:56.540]   and the serpent is already there, deceitful.
[00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.080]   Manifestly opposed to the God of creation.
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.660]   That's where the Bible begins.
[00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.780]   And as far as I can see,
[00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.880]   no explanation is offered in the Bible
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.500]   for how Satan became evil.
[00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.640]   I know there are hints that he was a perfect angel
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.060]   created by God.
[00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.620]   Jude says that he refers to angels
[00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.960]   who did not stay within their own position of authority,
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.500]   but left their proper dwelling,
[00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.280]   whom God has kept in eternal chains under gloomy darkness
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.120]   until the judgment of the great day.
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.980]   And I don't doubt that Satan was created good
[00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.980]   and fell from his proper place, like Jude says,
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.280]   because I don't think that evil and God
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.460]   are both eternal and ultimate realities.
[00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.160]   I'm not a dualist.
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.160]   God and his goodness and wisdom and power
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.100]   are the only ultimate eternal realities.
[00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.100]   And thus evil is somehow derivative, secondary,
[00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.260]   without God being a sinner.
[00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.120]   And all of that, virtually all Christians agree on.
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.500]   But how did Satan become evil?
[00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.300]   I do not know.
[00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:36.100]   And it is plain to me that those who believe
[00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:41.100]   in ultimate self-determination of God's creatures,
[00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.860]   like angels and humans, don't know either.
[00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.540]   To say that Satan had free will,
[00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.780]   that is ultimate self-determination,
[00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.500]   to say that Satan had free will
[00:03:53.500 --> 00:04:00.100]   is not an explanation for why he committed his first sin.
[00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.220]   It's a label.
[00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.700]   It's a label.
[00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.140]   It's not an explanation.
[00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.180]   It's a label of a mystery.
[00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.180]   How could a perfectly good being
[00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.140]   with a perfectly good will
[00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.340]   and a perfectly good heart
[00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:26.340]   ever experience any imperfect impulse
[00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.980]   that would cause the will to move in the direction of sin?
[00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.900]   And the answer is nobody knows,
[00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.500]   including those who say, "Oh, it's free will."
[00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.180]   That's not an explanation.
[00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.680]   It's a name for a mystery.
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.220]   So we don't know.
[00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.340]   The Bible doesn't explain the how of it.
[00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.340]   So Rob quotes Norman Geisler, who says,
[00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.140]   "The unmistakable logical conclusion
[00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.380]   for the extreme Calvinist,
[00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.300]   for both Lucifer and Adam, that they sinned
[00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.460]   is because God gave them the desire to sin."
[00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.740]   Now, I'm not sure whether I qualify
[00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.500]   for Geisler's extreme Calvinist,
[00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.520]   but I strongly suspect that I do.
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.060]   But just at this point,
[00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.900]   I am disagreeing with that description of me,
[00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.580]   and I am saying, no, I am not driven
[00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:27.220]   to say God gave, gave,
[00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.940]   Lucifer his first desire to sin.
[00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.700]   That is an oversimplification
[00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.900]   of virtually everybody's viewpoint.
[00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.900]   I do not know how Lucifer came
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:47.120]   to feel his first inclination to rebel against God.
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:52.400]   But here is what I do know.
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.260]   God is indeed sovereign,
[00:05:55.260 --> 00:06:00.260]   and nothing comes to pass apart from his plan,
[00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:05.760]   which includes things he more or less causes directly
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:09.640]   and things he more or less permits indirectly.
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:14.440]   And there is no doubt in my mind that Satan's fall
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.640]   and all of the redemptive plan of God
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.720]   for the glory of his grace afterwards
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.580]   was according to God's eternal plan.
[00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.320]   But it is precisely at this point
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:32.320]   that the how of the causality of Satan's first sin worked.
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.640]   We do not know.
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:38.680]   I have a category in my thinking, in other words,
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:42.240]   for the fact that God can see to it
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:47.820]   that something come to pass, which he hates.
[00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:50.940]   This is what he did, for example,
[00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:55.940]   when he planned the crucifixion of Jesus,
[00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:59.840]   according to Acts 4.27 and 4.28.
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.600]   The murder of Jesus was sinful,
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:07.600]   and it was planned down to the detail by God.
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.100]   You can read it in the Psalms,
[00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.480]   and you can read it in the New Testament.
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:16.920]   Precisely how God does that,
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:20.680]   maintaining his sinlessness
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:24.200]   and the sin of the things that comes about
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:27.800]   and the moral accountability of those who do those sins,
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:31.900]   the how of that, I do not know.
[00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:34.960]   But I think the Bible leads us to believe
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.960]   that he is sovereign over all sin
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.880]   and that he never sins.
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:45.320]   That is what I believe the Bible teaches.
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:50.320]   Now, how he does it, there might be hints in the Bible.
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:53.880]   And I am gonna give you one pointer.
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:56.540]   And I do not claim this as an explanation,
[00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:58.880]   but it's worth thinking about as a pointer
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:00.560]   toward a possible explanation
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:02.560]   that maybe we'll understand someday.
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:06.560]   In Isaiah 63.17, the prophet cries out to the people,
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:11.160]   "Oh Lord, why do you make us wander from your ways?"
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:11.980]   Did you hear that?
[00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:15.600]   "Oh Lord, why do you make us wander from your ways
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:19.640]   "and harden our heart so that we fear you not?
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:22.420]   "Return for the sake of your servants,
[00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:24.320]   "the tribes of your heritage."
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:29.320]   And so he ascribes to God the ultimate causality,
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:35.280]   somehow, of our wandering, Israel's wandering, into sin.
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:37.680]   How did God do that?
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:39.280]   The second half of the verse says,
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:43.280]   "Return for the sake of your servants,"
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:48.280]   suggesting, pointing, that somehow God's absence did it.
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:52.040]   And then he says in Isaiah 64.7,
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.800]   this is what, seven or eight verses later,
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:58.620]   "There is no one here who calls upon your name,
[00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:01.540]   "who rouses himself to take hold of you,
[00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:06.540]   "for you have hidden your face from us,
[00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:10.760]   "and have made us melt in the hand of our iniquities."
[00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:15.140]   And so again, it's the hiding of his face
[00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:17.780]   that explains the sin.
[00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:19.060]   And I'm not saying,
[00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:23.380]   this is a foolproof explanation of sin.
[00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:28.380]   Like somehow God cloaked his glory from Lucifer,
[00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:31.620]   and in the cloaking of his glory,
[00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:35.060]   somehow, still inexplicable to me,
[00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:38.900]   there rises a preference in Lucifer's heart for himself
[00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:41.100]   over God who has cloaked his glory.
[00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:42.040]   I don't know how that happens,
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:45.100]   but this is a pointer that something like that
[00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:46.900]   might have been going on.
[00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:49.680]   I'm simply saying this is worth pondering,
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.660]   that God may be able to govern the presence
[00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:56.540]   and absence of sin, not by direct active agency,
[00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:58.660]   but by concealing himself.
[00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:02.180]   I think it was Edwards who said,
[00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:07.180]   "There's a difference between the way light is caused
[00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:10.120]   "at three o'clock in the afternoon
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:12.280]   "by the shining of the sun,
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:15.780]   "and the way the shadows are caused
[00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:18.880]   "by the blocking of that sun by the tree,
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:21.240]   "though it is the light of the sun
[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:24.180]   "that is responsible for both the brightness of the day
[00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:26.260]   "and the shadows under the tree."
[00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.260]   But I end where I began.
[00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:32.580]   How the very first sin in the universe came about
[00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:33.960]   is a mystery to me.
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:37.220]   I do not know how.
[00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:40.100]   What I am taught in the Bible
[00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:43.740]   is that God is sovereign over all things, including sin,
[00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:46.520]   and he himself is never a sinner.
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:48.580]   - That's very perceptive.
[00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:52.900]   And again, those passages are Isaiah 63, verse 17,
[00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:55.220]   and Isaiah 64, verse seven.
[00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:57.100]   I'm certainly gonna look at those passages
[00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:58.380]   more carefully myself.
[00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:00.140]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:03.140]   So should we hate Satan?
[00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:06.220]   John Piper will address that follow-up question tomorrow
[00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:08.580]   right here on the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:09.820]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:10.860]   Thanks for listening.
[00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:13.440]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:16.020]   (upbeat music)
