[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.040]   Fees are important, and it's worth keeping an eye on, and you're right.
[00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.420]   When you go to 401(k) programs, and I think they've gotten better initially, they were
[00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:09.420]   horrible.
[00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.380]   The kinds of choices I'd see in plans that people would bring me, there was no index
[00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.520]   option at all.
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:19.860]   Now I tell people frequently these plans have scores of funds to choose from, which again
[00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.440]   in my world is kind of nonsensical.
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.240]   Typically you'll have, if you have 401(k), you will be able to get a list of all the
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:33.060]   funds they have, and there should be a column on that list of the expense ratios, the ER.
[00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.600]   And what I tell people, especially who are not familiar with the different funds, the
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.480]   way you find the index funds is you put your finger on that column, and you start scrolling
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.880]   down looking for the lowest number.
[00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:50.880]   And when you start seeing things that are like .05, .04, you've found the index funds.
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.760]   And then look at those, and you should be able to figure out, oh that's an S&P 500 fund,
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.660]   or that's a total stock market, if that's what you want.
