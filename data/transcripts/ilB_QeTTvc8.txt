[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200]   Will all of us experience it?
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.240]   Blasphemous thoughts about God emerge in our minds.
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.040]   So where do these thoughts come from and how do we respond?
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.080]   The question comes in from a listener named Hayden.
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.960]   Dear Pastor John, for seven long years, I've had hard thoughts of Christ.
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.540]   There have been good seasons in which I have been overwhelmed with the beauty and grace
[00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:30.400]   of Christ and there have been indescribably painful seasons where He seems so disappointed
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.540]   with me that I have been driven well nigh to despair.
[00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.700]   Often I fear that I am the wicked servant who said of the Master, "I was afraid because
[00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.100]   I knew you were a hard man."
[00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.740]   Luke 19, 21.
[00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.500]   Then I fear that I am not saved at all because I don't perceive Jesus correctly.
[00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.740]   I want to treasure Christ above all, but I often fear that I don't because these thoughts
[00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:54.900]   harass me.
[00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.940]   I have confessed all known sin in my life and I've cried out to God repeatedly, "What
[00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.420]   is wrong with me?
[00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.140]   How should I approach this situation biblically?
[00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.580]   What are some specific scripture passages that you would direct me to when these hard
[00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.340]   thoughts about Christ arise in my mind?"
[00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:19.900]   Hayden says, "There are thoughts that harass me," and specifically thoughts that Christ
[00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.860]   is a hard master.
[00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.620]   Hard thoughts about Christ.
[00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.100]   So there are two issues it seems to me.
[00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.100]   I want to address both of them.
[00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.660]   One is, what do you do when thoughts harass you?
[00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:39.900]   And secondly, what do you do when you believe or think that Christ is a hard master?
[00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.460]   So first, what about harassing thoughts?
[00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:48.020]   Be careful not to make too much of thoughts that enter your mind.
[00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:54.020]   Seems to me that Satan's main strategy for ruining people is by deceiving them either
[00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.260]   by sowing destructive thoughts in their minds or by influencing us to deal with our thoughts
[00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.300]   in a destructive way.
[00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:07.420]   And besides Satan, our own fleshly nature can do the same thing, can send thoughts into
[00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:15.340]   our mind, which means that the presence of a thought in your mind is not necessarily
[00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.820]   a mark of your own identity in Christ.
[00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.900]   So important to realize.
[00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.580]   It's not necessarily a mark of your new nature in Jesus.
[00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.580]   It's an alien thought.
[00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.860]   An enemy has done this, you might say.
[00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.140]   Either yourself or Satan.
[00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.660]   The old self, I mean.
[00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:42.180]   So there are four things I want to say to Hayden about this harassment.
[00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.740]   First, view it as that, harassment.
[00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.460]   It's not an atom bomb.
[00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.820]   Treat it more like an annoying fly.
[00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:56.500]   You got to swat, get it out of your face, swat it, rather than the end of the world.
[00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:02.980]   Second, say to the thought, "No, no, that's not what I think, Mr. Thought.
[00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.020]   You can get out of here.
[00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.580]   I renounce you."
[00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:11.740]   Third, turn your mind then to an alternative truth that is you, that's based in Scripture.
[00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.580]   And fourth, ask God to liberate you from this harassment.
[00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.100]   Take your confidence from Philippians 4, 6.
[00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.660]   Don't be anxious about anything but in everything by prayer and supplication.
[00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:29.100]   Let your requests be made known to God, and the peace of God that passes all understanding
[00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.540]   will—and this is the key—guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.
[00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:40.140]   Don't you think that means protect you from the destructive effects of harassing thoughts
[00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:46.140]   which take root in hearts and minds, and we're praying that there be a guard from God not
[00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.840]   to let that happen.
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:56.060]   But it may be for Hayden that the bigger issue then the fact of harassment is the content
[00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.300]   of the harassing thought, namely, Christ is a hard master.
[00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:06.100]   And I thought maybe the most helpful thing I could do here, rather than jumping all over
[00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:13.620]   the Bible for a bunch of texts, would be to stay pretty much with the parable where Hayden
[00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.780]   got the trouble.
[00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.780]   The parable of the talents where five are given to one, two are given to another, one
[00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:27.540]   is given to one, and the one with one buries it, and he gives the reason for why he buried
[00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:28.540]   it.
[00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:34.740]   "I knew you were a hard master, so I didn't risk losing the talent that you gave me.
[00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.540]   Here is your talent.
[00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.580]   I just buried it."
[00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:44.060]   So let me say a quick three things about this situation in the parable.
[00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.900]   The parable is Matthew 25, 14 to 30.
[00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.100]   We don't have time to read the whole thing.
[00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:58.860]   And these observations, I hope, will change Hayden's or anybody's perception of Christ
[00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.760]   as a hard master.
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:09.460]   Number one, I don't think Jesus accepts the assessment of himself by that man whom he
[00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.620]   gave the one talent to, who said he was a hard master.
[00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:18.180]   I think the translators are right to make verse 26 a question.
[00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:27.480]   It goes like this, "You knew that I reap where I have not sown, and gather where I scattered
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.480]   no seed?"
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.500]   That's a question.
[00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.860]   If you really believe that, Jesus is saying you would have acted differently.
[00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.640]   You were a fool.
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.320]   If you think I'm a hard man, that was a foolish thing to do.
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:46.360]   But in fact, you didn't know that I was a hard man.
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.580]   I'm not a hard master.
[00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:55.040]   I do not demand obedience from people to whom I have given no grace.
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:59.280]   I think that's the interpretation of "you reap where you did not sow."
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:06.520]   But the last judgment, "It will be plain to all the world that all disobedience is
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:11.600]   in spite of much truth and much grace."
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:18.240]   Paul gives the principle in 2 Corinthians 8, 12, he says, "If the readiness to give,
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:25.600]   to be generous, if the readiness is there, it is acceptable, acceptable by God and by
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:26.600]   me.
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:37.360]   It is acceptable according to what a person has, not according to what he does not have."
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:44.360]   That's a flat-out contradiction of what the man said who buried the one talent.
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:52.040]   Jesus does not demand fruit where he has not sown seed.
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:07:00.000]   So the first thing Hayden should do with the harassing thought that Christ is hard, the
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:08.680]   way this man in his face says he's hard, is to say to that thought, "No, he's not.
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:09.920]   You're wrong.
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.800]   You should not have said that about Jesus."
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:22.560]   Second, the real picture of the master in this parable is found in 25, 21 and 25, 23,
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:27.600]   where he is thrilled with the first two servants.
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:34.520]   One man with five talents that became five, and another man with two talents that became
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:35.520]   two.
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:44.160]   And he says to both of them exuberantly, "Well done, good and faithful servants."
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:49.120]   And then he adds, and this is why I said it's exuberant, then he adds, "Not enter into
[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.480]   the loyal workforce of your master."
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:54.260]   Like I'm recruiting really effective slaves.
[00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.000]   What does he say?
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   He says at the last day, "Enter into the joy of your master."
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.880]   That's not a hard master.
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:13.200]   This is a happy master, eager to include the workers in the joy of his house, his house,
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:16.640]   where he's happy, not his field where he's making demands.
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:21.680]   So Hayden, preach to yourself that Christ is a happy master.
[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:29.720]   C.S. Lewis said, "Christ is hard to satisfy and easy to please," which simply means—I
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:35.160]   think that's right—which simply means this, "His standards are infinitely high.
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:44.480]   He's God, but oh, how ready he is to say well done to a faithful, imperfect servant."
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:45.480]   He's gracious.
[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:47.760]   He's God, so his standards are infinite.
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:51.040]   He's gracious, so he loves to say well done.
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:59.680]   And finally, number three, what if the thought goes through your head, but Jesus does say,
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:04.200]   "That the way is hard that leads to life."
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:10.760]   Matthew 7, 13, "Enter by the narrow gate, for the gate is wide and the way is easy that
[00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:14.320]   leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many, but the gate is narrow and
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:20.360]   the way is hard, hard, hard that leads to life, and those who find it are few."
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.120]   So is he a hard master?
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:28.200]   But wait, listen to this, "Come to me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I'll
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.000]   give you rest.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.840]   Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I'm gentle and lowly in heart, and you'll
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:42.640]   find rest for your souls, for my yoke is easy and my burden is light."
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:43.640]   Easy?
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:47.280]   I thought you said it was hard.
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:48.600]   So how do those fit together?
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.480]   Jesus doesn't contradict himself.
[00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:51.480]   He's not schizophrenic.
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:54.540]   He doesn't speak with forked tongue.
[00:09:54.540 --> 00:10:04.760]   The word for hard in Matthew 7, 14 is afflicted, beset with all kinds of pressing, hard experiences
[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:05.760]   in life.
[00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:07.000]   Yes, yes.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:13.640]   And Paul said in Acts 14, 22, I think, Paul said, "Through many tribulations, through
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:19.320]   many afflictions," and it's built on the same word as the word hard there in Matthew 7,
[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:26.600]   14, "through many afflictions, hard experiences, buffetings and pressings and squeezings till
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:32.000]   we feel like we can't stand it anymore, through many afflictions we must enter the kingdom
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   of God."
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.680]   There's no illusion in the Bible, in Jesus' mind, that the Christian life is easy in the
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:41.920]   sense of escaping suffering.
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:51.360]   And God's role in that includes meeting every need, every need that we have.
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:11:00.480]   He says, "No test," sometimes translated temptation, but same word, "No test befalls us but what
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:04.040]   there is grace to endure and escape."
[00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.400]   First Corinthians 10, 13.
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:13.960]   He says, "My God," Paul says, "My God will supply every need of yours according to its
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:15.920]   riches in glory."
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:22.000]   Every need that you have to deal with the pressures and squeezings and hardness of life.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.920]   In 2 Corinthians 9, 8, "God is able to make all grace abound to you so that having all
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:32.960]   sufficiency in all things at all times you may abound in every good work."
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:41.640]   God does not load His children with burdens and watch to see how they do.
[00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:48.320]   Every burden that He gives, He provides grace to lighten our load.
[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:49.440]   That's good.
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:56.140]   The eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth to show Himself mighty on
[00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:59.880]   behalf of those whose hearts are whole toward Him.
[00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:04.280]   2 Chronicles 16, 9, I love the thought that God is looking everywhere.
[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:06.560]   Where is somebody who will let me lift the load?
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:09.840]   Where is somebody who will let me carry their load?
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:16.080]   Or Isaiah 64, 4, "Who is a God like you who works for those who wait for Him, who let
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.560]   me carry their burden?"
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:25.300]   So, Hayden, whenever you have thoughts that Christ is a hard master and that His demands
[00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:30.720]   are hard, remember He never leaves you to yourself.
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:33.840]   Say with John Bunyan, oh, how I love this little poem.
[00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:36.120]   John Bunyan, bless his heart.
[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:42.880]   Run John, run, the law demands, but gives him neither feet nor hands.
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:46.000]   Far better news the gospel brings.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.560]   It bids him fly and gives him wings.
[00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:50.560]   Amen.
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:51.920]   So good.
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:54.520]   Thank you, John Bunyan, and thank you, Pastor John.

[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:17.360]   Well, I'm really happy to finally get to this next question.
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:21.640]   Do we need to hear from God before we make a decision?
[00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:25.720]   And what if we have a friend who claims to have heard God's voice on something, but we
[00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:28.080]   think they're mistaken in their decision?
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:32.360]   How do we question that decision without undermining their faith?
[00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:33.640]   Wow.
[00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:35.020]   That's a really sharp question.
[00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:36.440]   It's on Wednesday when we return.
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:37.440]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:38.440]   We'll see you then.
[00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:43.440]   [END]
[00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:53.440]   1
