[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.920]   Unfortunately, the beginning of this exposition by Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones, the 11th in the
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.680]   series on St. Paul's Epistle to the Romans, is missing due to a fault on the original
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:11.680]   recording.
[00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:20.200]   ...hell bound, and that I cannot save myself, but that God has provided the way in Jesus
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.780]   Christ and him crucified.
[00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:24.700]   And I therefore believe that.
[00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.320]   But if I believe that, I'm not going to continue where I was.
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.020]   I must be sorry for my sin, which has necessitated the coming of the Son of God into the world
[00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.340]   and his terrible death upon the cross.
[00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.660]   I must have sorrow for sin.
[00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.320]   Why do I go to him if I'm not conscious of my sin?
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.780]   And having done all that, I turn away from my sin.
[00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.820]   I don't want to belong to the world and its sin any longer.
[00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.660]   I want to belong to him and to please him, who has done so much for me.
[00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.940]   I give myself to him.
[00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.340]   As we saw last Friday, you can't believe in the Lord Jesus Christ at all unless you believe
[00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.360]   in him as your Lord.
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:11.140]   But you see how often people seem rarely to be teaching nothing but a kind of believism.
[00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.640]   And they say you can be a Christian without repenting, that that's going to come later.
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.860]   But what have you believed?
[00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.380]   What does believing in the Lord Jesus Christ mean if there isn't this sorrow for sin, this
[00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.860]   realization of your desperate plight as the result of sin?
[00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:27.860]   Very well.
[00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.360]   Now this one term, the obedience of faith, includes all that.
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.640]   The apostle uses his terms very deliberately.
[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.400]   He doesn't just say believe the gospel.
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.680]   He says the obedience of faith.
[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.280]   Faith is always an obedience.
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.560]   Now you notice that I'm not talking about works that are going to follow all this.
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:57.080]   I say the very process of becoming Christian is this obedience of faith.
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.960]   Because I believe this, as I believe it, I turn away and I turn to God with grateful
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.760]   thanks because of what Christ Jesus has done for me.
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.160]   The obedience of faith.
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.740]   Now then the apostle tells us that he has received grace of the apostleship in order
[00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.880]   to call people to this obedience of faith.
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.920]   Then the next thing he tells us is that he's being called to do this among all nations.
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:31.760]   Now here's another most important addition to the statement.
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.040]   You will find that there is a good deal of disagreement as to the exact meaning of this.
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.800]   Those who've got the revised version in front of them will find that it agrees with this
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.380]   authorised which says among all nations.
[00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.880]   But those who are carrying with them at the present time the revised standard version
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.400]   will find that there it is, among all the Gentiles.
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.880]   Not among all nations, but among all the Gentiles.
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:10.320]   Now that is a possible explanation because the word can be translated either as nations
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.040]   or as Gentiles.
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.880]   How do we decide therefore which it is?
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.720]   Well those who would agree with the revised standard version generally say this.
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:27.120]   They say surely he means here Gentiles for this reason, that he boasts in this very epistle
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:34.080]   in the 11th chapter and the 13th verse that he is pre-eminently the apostle of the Gentiles
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.880]   and that he magnifies his office as the apostle of the Gentiles.
[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:46.080]   And therefore here he is speaking of Gentiles because he was writing to the church at Rome.
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.120]   Well if you can still remember it, at the very beginning we pointed out that the church
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.000]   of Rome included Jews as well as Gentiles in its membership.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.160]   So that that is no argument.
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.880]   But it seems to me there are other very powerful arguments which compel me at Inuit to reject
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.360]   this translation of Gentiles instead of nations.
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:12.000]   I want to hold to this authorized translation, "by whom we have received grace and apostleship
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.680]   for obedience to the faith among all nations."
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.680]   Why?
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.400]   Well here are some of the reasons.
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:26.120]   If he really is speaking about Gentiles, he needn't have used the word "all."
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.240]   There's no point in saying "by whom we have received grace and apostleship for obedience
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.240]   to the faith among all the Gentiles."
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:38.760]   He'd simply need to say, "for obedience to the faith among the Gentiles."
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:39.760]   And no more.
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.960]   But he deliberately uses the word "all."
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.920]   And that's a significant point.
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:50.920]   Secondly, I think that it's nations rather than Gentiles because at this point he is
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:55.360]   making a general statement about the gospel itself.
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.560]   It's from here on he begins to speak particularly about the church at Rome.
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:04.680]   This fifth verse ends the general introduction to the epistle.
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:11.080]   The particular introduction to the Romans starts at verse 6 and goes on until about
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.780]   verse 16.
[00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.720]   So there's a second reason.
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.240]   But there are still more powerful reasons.
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.480]   If you read the account of the apostles' call by the Lord Jesus Christ on the road
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:30.240]   to Damascus, you'll find it in Acts 26, you will find that the Lord specifically told
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:38.040]   him that he was sending him to the Jews, to the people, and also to the Gentiles.
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.440]   Not only to the Gentiles, but to the Jews first.
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:48.100]   And the apostle Paul, as the record in Acts tells us, did actually preach to the Jews
[00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.360]   before he began to preach to the Gentiles.
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:56.880]   He here is putting himself in with the other apostles by whom we, those who belong to the
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:01.600]   apostolate, we have received grace and apostleship.
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:06.080]   And the apostles were sent to preach to the Jew first and also to the Gentiles.
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:13.680]   They were to start in Jerusalem, then in Samaria, then in the uttermost parts of the earth.
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:19.520]   So that there, it seems to me, is another powerful argument for nations rather than
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.460]   Gentiles.
[00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.960]   And the next is this.
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.860]   That this, after all, is one of the great themes of this epistle to the Romans.
[00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:33.440]   It's one of the things in which the apostle rejoices most of all.
[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:34.920]   Listen to him in verse 16.
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.120]   He can't go further without bringing it out.
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:43.640]   "I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God unto salvation
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:47.720]   to every one that believeth."
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:51.560]   To the Jew first.
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.720]   And also to the Greek.
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.800]   That's the thing that he's proud of.
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.560]   That's why he exalts in it.
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:02.560]   That's why, to use his literties again, he's not ashamed of it.
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:09.240]   "For it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth."
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:16.600]   To the Jew first, but also, it's this amazing also, to the Greek.
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.000]   That's a surprising thing.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.340]   Not the Jews only any longer, but the Gentiles have also come in.
[00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:27.120]   And then he goes on with his mighty argument to prove that the whole of mankind needed
[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.120]   it.
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:33.560]   He takes it up in verse 18 of the first chapter, and runs right through with it to the 20th
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:38.920]   verse of the third chapter, proving that all the Gentiles were under the wrath of God,
[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:43.000]   and in chapter 2, that all the Jews were under the wrath of God.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.840]   They all need salvation in the same way.
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.680]   There is none righteous, no, not one.
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:55.120]   And then he winds it up in one of his great statements, which you will find in the 22nd
[00:07:55.120 --> 00:08:02.360]   verse of the third chapter, "The righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ,
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:06.480]   unto all and upon all them that believe.
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:15.920]   For there is no difference, for all have sinned and have come short of the glory of God."
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:21.040]   And then, even that wasn't enough, because in the 29th verse he puts it in the form of
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:23.320]   a rhetorical question.
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:26.680]   Is he the God of the Jews only?
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:29.680]   Is he not also of the Gentiles?
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:35.400]   Yes, of the Gentiles also.
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:39.960]   That was the thing in which the apostle rejoiced.
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:44.000]   Not only the God of the Jews, but the God of the Gentiles also.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   Is he?
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.160]   Yes, of the Gentiles also.
[00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:53.440]   And then, of course, in chapter 11, he's got his tremendous statement of it there,
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:56.240]   "The fullness of the Gentiles is going to come in.
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:58.560]   All Israel is going to be saved."
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:02.280]   That's the thing, this glorious conception.
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:06.720]   The fullness of the Gentiles, the fullness of the Jews.
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:13.440]   And so the work is complete and the kingdom will be handed back unto God.
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:19.600]   And then a further argument is this, that it's the apostles' great theme in every epistle.
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.400]   Take the epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:23.560]   What is it that's happening in this dispensation?
[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:31.160]   Well, it's God's great program for you, reuniting in one all things, whether they be in heaven
[00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:35.560]   or in earth, all things even in him.
[00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:39.820]   The second chapter, the middle wall of partition, has broken down.
[00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:44.820]   He cries, "Peace, peace to them that are afar off, as well as them that are nigh."
[00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:50.040]   Not the Jews only, but the Gentiles who were strangers from the commonwealth of Israel,
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:55.200]   who were without hope and without God in the world, but they've been brought nigh.
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:10:01.680]   They've been introduced into the promises of the kingdom, into the commonwealth of God.
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:04.360]   It's his great theme everywhere.
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:08.400]   And therefore I say, let's hold on to the word "nations" here.
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:11.720]   Nations including the Jews, all nations.
[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:16.680]   Jewish nations, non-Jewish nations, all nations.
[00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:24.060]   In other words, what the apostle is announcing here is the thing which thrilled him, namely
[00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:32.360]   the great truth that the Lord Jesus Christ is the Savior of the world.
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:35.280]   He is not merely the Jewish Messiah.
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:41.960]   There is no longer Jew nor Greek, barbarian or Scythian, male nor female, bond or free.
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:43.880]   All that is gone.
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:46.720]   The Savior of the world.
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:56.200]   That's why he likes to repeat his name, Jesus Christ our Lord, this glorious, blessed Savior,
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:11:01.920]   who's great enough and big enough to include the whole world, Son of God as well as Son
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:09.360]   of men, not only seed of David, but the everlasting, eternal, only begotten of the Father.
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:16.360]   Ah, you see, Paul isn't the only one who rejoiced in this.
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:21.560]   Look at the aged Simeon as he stands with the infant in his arms.
[00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:26.240]   And as he looks at him and speaks and says, "This is the truth about him, he is a light
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:33.840]   to lighten the Gentiles and the glory of thy people Israel."
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:40.080]   You see, there it is from the very beginning, and it is the special glory of our gospel.
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:45.560]   Indeed our Lord himself had taught it when he said, "And I, if I be lifted up, will
[00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:48.000]   draw all men unto me."
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.400]   That doesn't mean every individual, it means all nations.
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:55.960]   You remember the context there in John 12?
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:59.920]   The Greeks had come to Andrew and had said we would see Jesus.
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:05.080]   And the reply is, "Not now, you can't see me now, but I, if I be lifted up, when I am
[00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:11.320]   crucified, when I've done the work, will draw all men, men of all nations, unto me."
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:16.960]   "I am," he says, "the light of the world.
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:20.060]   Other sheep I have which are not of this fold."
[00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:25.960]   This fold is the Jewish one, but other sheep I have which are not of this fold.
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:30.240]   He's going to call in the Gentiles.
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:36.680]   So it's not surprising that the inspired apostles at the very beginning could face the authorities
[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:41.720]   who had prohibited them to preach any more in this great name, that they could stand
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:51.120]   before them and say, "Neither is there salvation in any other, for there is none other name
[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:58.740]   under heaven given amongst men whereby we must be saved."
[00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:08.360]   The obedience of faith among all nations, the Jewish Messiah, the Savior of the world,
[00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:13.020]   all nations, what a wonderful message.
[00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:18.980]   No, no, he's not merely saying here that he's the apostle to the Gentiles.
[00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:24.380]   He has a gospel to preach to anybody, whatever he is, to the Jew or to the Greek, the wise
[00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:30.220]   or the unwise, it doesn't matter who, any soul that is in need and that believes, here
[00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:32.660]   is his Savior.
[00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:35.940]   All nations.
[00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:40.620]   And then that brings me to the last point.
[00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:45.660]   The apostles, as I've indicated, have three great reasons for constantly mentioning this
[00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:46.660]   name.
[00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:50.180]   He is what he is because of him.
[00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:54.020]   He does what he does because of him.
[00:13:54.020 --> 00:14:05.700]   My third and last reason is this, says the apostle, "I do what I do for his name."
[00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:14.620]   By whom we have received grace and apostleship for obedience to the faith among all nations,
[00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:16.460]   for his name.
[00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:21.020]   Ah, this is the climax.
[00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:25.420]   Translate it if you like, with the revised standard at this point, "for the sake of
[00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:27.620]   his name."
[00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:30.340]   For his name's sake.
[00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:32.860]   I'm an apostle, says Paul, I'm a preacher.
[00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:37.220]   I'm calling upon people in all nations to the obedience of faith.
[00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:40.140]   Why am I doing it?
[00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:43.900]   For his name's sake.
[00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:46.340]   That's his motive, that's his reason.
[00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:47.340]   Now what does this mean?
[00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:54.100]   Well, you can look at it like this, if you like, "for his glory."
[00:14:54.100 --> 00:15:00.620]   The introduction of this term "name" is important and significant.
[00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:07.260]   The name in scripture always stands for the revelation by which we know and apprehend
[00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.300]   the person indicated.
[00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:11.980]   Take for instance in the Old Testament.
[00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:18.980]   God revealed himself to the nation of Israel through various names.
[00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:22.860]   You'll find them in the Old Testament scriptures.
[00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:26.900]   Jehovah, various additions to that.
[00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:30.580]   Jehovah-Jireh, Jehovah-Shalom, and so on.
[00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:36.900]   God makes himself known through names, names which are descriptive of him, of his person,
[00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:41.380]   of his motives, of his desires, and of his activities.
[00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:44.620]   The name reveals the man.
[00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:46.980]   We say about a man, "Ah, he's got a great name.
[00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:51.820]   He's got a great name as a barrister or as a doctor or something like that.
[00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:52.820]   He's got a great name."
[00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:57.060]   Well, now, we mean by that, that name which he's got tells us about him.
[00:15:57.060 --> 00:16:00.420]   Now, the apostle uses it in that sense here.
[00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:07.740]   The name stands for and represents the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:15.180]   "I do it," says Paul, "I preach for his glory's sake, in order to glorify him
[00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:21.580]   and in order to bring people to glorify him and to glory in him."
[00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:25.820]   So you see, it works out like this.
[00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:38.140]   By obeying this gospel, by our obedience of faith, we glorify the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:44.900]   Now, the apostle's statement, therefore, is that he preaches and he labors to that
[00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:46.900]   one great end.
[00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:49.100]   That's his prime motive.
[00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:55.420]   That's the thing that drives him on, that Christ may be glorified, that his glory may
[00:16:55.420 --> 00:17:02.060]   be manifest amongst the people, and that all may live to the praise of the glory of his
[00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:03.060]   grace.
[00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:05.260]   That's his constant term.
[00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:14.540]   Now, here again, I would pause for a moment in order to emphasize this very vital truth,
[00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:18.340]   especially in these days.
[00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:22.460]   Did you notice that significant statement which I read in that seventeenth chapter of
[00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:24.780]   John's gospel at the beginning?
[00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:29.620]   One of the most astounding things our Lord ever said about Christians, had you realized
[00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:31.740]   that this is true of you?
[00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:42.700]   He says, "All mine are thine, and thine are mine, and I am glorified in them."
[00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:45.660]   You notice the context?
[00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:53.220]   He says that he has glorified his Father while he was here upon earth.
[00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:58.500]   And now he says, "I am coming back unto thee, but they are staying in the world, and
[00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:02.500]   I am glorified in them."
[00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:08.380]   The Father was glorified in him, he is glorified in them.
[00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:14.020]   I am glorified in them.
[00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:19.300]   Now I believe the apostle is teaching something like that at this very point.
[00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:25.980]   He believed it, and he regarded his work as an apostle, as being a part of this glorifying
[00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:27.860]   of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:32.980]   And it's of tremendous significance for us in this way.
[00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:40.580]   Not to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ is to refuse to glorify him, and that is the
[00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:41.580]   essence of sin.
[00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:44.260]   Do you remember how our Lord put it himself?
[00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:49.260]   He said, talking about the coming of the Holy Ghost, he said, "When he shall come, he
[00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:53.860]   shall convince the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment."
[00:18:53.860 --> 00:19:00.180]   Of sin, because they believe not on me.
[00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:04.900]   Of righteousness, because I go unto the Father and the world seeth me no more.
[00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:08.260]   Of judgment, because the Prince of this world is now judged.
[00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:16.260]   But you notice the first one, of sin, because they believe not on me.
[00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:19.060]   God has glorified and honored his own Son.
[00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:25.500]   The Son prayed to him, "Father, glorify thyself and glorify me with the glory which I had
[00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:27.340]   with thee before the world was."
[00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:28.420]   And the Father did it.
[00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:34.180]   He did it preeminently, as we've seen, in the resurrection and in the exaltation of
[00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:35.980]   the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:41.220]   He's been glorified by the Father.
[00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:45.940]   And you and I are called upon to glorify him also.
[00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:53.700]   "I am glorified in them," he says, so that as Christian people we are called to that
[00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:56.260]   that is our calling, that is our task.
[00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:58.300]   How do we do so?
[00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:01.020]   How can I glorify the Lord Jesus Christ?
[00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:04.460]   Well I do so by believing in him.
[00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:09.780]   When I say that I believe he's the only begotten Son, I am glorifying him.
[00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:13.900]   Jesus, the man, Son of God, I'm glorifying him.
[00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:17.620]   I'm glorying in him.
[00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:25.300]   Not only that, when I believe in him, I am pronouncing, I am proclaiming that I believe
[00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:30.900]   that he came from heaven to earth because of his great and amazing love to redeem my
[00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:34.260]   soul, even including the death of the cross.
[00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:43.980]   And when I say that, I'm praising him, I'm glorying in his name, I'm glorifying him.
[00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:49.180]   Yes but we not only do it in our words, we do it in our lives, don't we?
[00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:53.740]   You remember how Peter puts this in his first epistle, second chapter, ninth verse.
[00:20:53.740 --> 00:21:01.140]   "Ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, and holy nation, a peculiar people, that in
[00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:10.940]   order that ye may show forth the praises, the virtues, the excellences, the glories
[00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:18.980]   of him who hath called you out of darkness into his most marvelous light."
[00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:21.580]   That's what we are as Christians.
[00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:28.840]   We are to show forth his excellences, his virtues, his greatness, his glories.
[00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:34.020]   We are to show it, to show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness.
[00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:36.180]   We do that in our lives.
[00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:41.540]   That is why we are to abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul, he says,
[00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:44.740]   because you can't be indulging in them and glorifying him.
[00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:50.700]   You are proclaiming as a Christian that Christ can deliver you from sin, from Satan, from
[00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:53.580]   the world, the flesh, and the devil.
[00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:57.340]   So we are glorifying him as we live the Christian life.
[00:21:57.340 --> 00:21:59.540]   People say, "Look at them.
[00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:01.300]   He has done this for them."
[00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:03.260]   We are glorifying his name.
[00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:06.180]   For his name's sake we are doing it.
[00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:13.340]   Not only that, we glorify him by desiring all to come to him, and by desiring all to
[00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:15.100]   praise him.
[00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:20.780]   You know, if somebody has done you a kindness, you tell everybody about him.
[00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:24.140]   If again I may use the illustration, you've been taken ill, you've gone to your doctor,
[00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:25.140]   he can't help you.
[00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:27.140]   You've gone to many others, they can't help you.
[00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:29.860]   At last you meet a man who puts you right.
[00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:30.860]   What do you do?
[00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:33.940]   Well, you tell everybody about him, and you want to send everybody to him.
[00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:35.540]   You want everybody to think well of him.
[00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:39.740]   You say, "What a marvelous man, and everybody must hear about him."
[00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:42.860]   Christians are to be like that with their Lord.
[00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:48.020]   We live for his sake, for his name's sake, for the sake of his glory.
[00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:54.860]   We want everybody to come and bow the knee to him who is so glorious and so wonderful.
[00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:59.700]   And in the same way, of course, we look forward to his coming.
[00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:07.020]   Because we know that when he comes, he will not come in the form of humiliation next time.
[00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:10.660]   He will come as the King of Kings, the Lord of Lords.
[00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:17.020]   He will be riding the cloud of heavens, surrounded by the holy angels, and he'll rout his enemies
[00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:22.100]   and banish sin and evil and set up his kingdom and reign.
[00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:23.860]   Who are we as Christians?
[00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:27.060]   Well, according to Paul writing to Titus, it's this.
[00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:34.700]   We are looking for the blessed hope and the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior,
[00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:35.700]   Jesus Christ.
[00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:38.340]   I'm an apostle, I'm preaching.
[00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:39.340]   Why?
[00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:40.820]   For his name.
[00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:46.700]   I want the whole world to fall at his feet and to look up in adoration and in wonder
[00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:51.740]   and in praise as they think of the babe of Bethlehem, the boy with the doctors of the
[00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:57.460]   law in the temple, the carpenter, the young men at age thirty setting out to preach all
[00:23:57.460 --> 00:23:58.460]   the great story.
[00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:05.340]   Oh, that the world bowed before him for his name I'm doing it, says Paul.
[00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:07.660]   It's the great theme of the Bible, this.
[00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:11.180]   Do you remember how you find it in the second Psalm?
[00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:12.180]   Read the second Psalm.
[00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:17.020]   It's all about the resurrection and the Son being glorified by the Father.
[00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:22.620]   And the Son addresses the princes and the kings of the world in these words.
[00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:26.180]   "Be wise now therefore, O ye kings.
[00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:28.900]   Be instructed, ye judges of the earth.
[00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:33.340]   Serve the Lord with fear and rejoice with trembling."
[00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:40.140]   Then listen, "Kiss the Son, kiss the Son.
[00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:42.620]   There is the Son on his throne.
[00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:45.460]   Get down on your knees, kiss his feet.
[00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:47.420]   He's the King.
[00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:52.380]   Rejected by the world, the kings of the world set themselves and the people imagined a vain
[00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:53.380]   thing in their rage.
[00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:59.100]   Yet have I set my Son, my King, on my holy mount of Zion.
[00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:06.780]   Therefore, kiss the Son, get down before him, kiss his very feet in an act of homage
[00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:10.580]   and obeisance and of obedience to him.
[00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:17.220]   Kiss the Son, lest he be angry and he perish from the way when his wrath is kindled but
[00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:18.220]   a little."
[00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:21.100]   That's what the Apostles say.
[00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:29.180]   "I have received grace and apostleship for obedience to the faith among all nations for
[00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:30.180]   his name."
[00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:36.820]   Oh yes, he preached in order that men and women might be saved and might be delivered
[00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:40.940]   from their besetting sins and might have happiness and peace and joy.
[00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:43.460]   But that wasn't the first thing.
[00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:50.460]   It was this blessed person that everybody might bow before him and confess that Jesus
[00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:54.580]   Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father.
[00:25:54.580 --> 00:26:04.900]   Oh, Paul did everything for this reason, to meet a Levite as his Christ and to die his
[00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:08.460]   gain because it means being with him.
[00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:12.700]   It was his glory that mattered and alone mattered with Paul.
[00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:15.460]   He was a Christ-intoxicated man.
[00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:20.060]   He lived for his praise and for his glory.
[00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:25.660]   My dear friends, do we?
[00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:27.300]   Is this how we live?
[00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:28.300]   We are meant to.
[00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:36.820]   "I am glorified in them," says our blessed Lord, "by our belief, by our life, by our
[00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:37.820]   everything."
[00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:41.380]   Is it true of us?
[00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:47.460]   Well let us offer this prayer together, the prayer of Joseph Leviter, which you'll find
[00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:56.220]   in that noble hymn, "O Jesus Christ, grow thou in me, and all things else recede."
[00:26:56.220 --> 00:27:06.380]   Listen to this verse, "Let faith in thee and in thy might, my every motive move.
[00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:19.300]   Be thou alone my soul's delight, my passion, and my love.
[00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:28.660]   Paul lived and worked and labored and died for his name.
[00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:31.300]   Do you?
[00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:42.100]   We are called to that that is our high privilege, to live unto him and for his glory, who came
[00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:53.060]   from heaven to earth and died and was buried and rose again, that we might become the sons
[00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:58.060]   of God for his name.
[00:27:58.060 --> 00:27:59.420]   Amen.
[00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:05.580]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
