[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.880]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:08.200]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while
[00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.280]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.680]   My name is Joshua, I am your host, and today we're going to talk about learning a language.
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.400]   I'm going to first give you a few reasons as to why you should seek to learn additional
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.760]   languages to what you already speak, and then give you some helpful tools, things that have
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:34.480]   been useful to me as I have tried to enhance my own language ability.
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.920]   To begin, why?
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.960]   Why should you learn an additional language to the languages that you speak right now?
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.040]   Many reasons why you should do it.
[00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.880]   Let's start with the financial ones to be most relevant to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:54.960]   When you think about your life and your earning ability, in order for you to earn more money,
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.340]   you need to systematically develop additional levels of skill.
[00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:06.480]   And every additional skill that you can develop will enhance your opportunities to earn money,
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.720]   if it's properly marketed and properly positioned.
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:17.480]   So I want you to imagine that you are jobless right now, and you are a high school dropout
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:23.880]   who spends no time, who has not done anything productive, has developed no economically
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:24.880]   valuable skills.
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.400]   You're a high school dropout whose primary skill is drinking beer and getting high.
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.400]   All right, that's it.
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.400]   Now, you want to go get a job.
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.400]   What do you do?
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.880]   Well, you've got basically nothing.
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:42.440]   You've got basically nothing to offer except possibly your physical strength and ability.
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:49.560]   So you might qualify for a job moving furniture, or you might qualify for a job driving a lawnmower.
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.680]   I've done those jobs.
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.760]   I've made money at those jobs.
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.560]   It's tough money, but that's all you're qualified for.
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.760]   That's about all you're going to do, and you're never going to make very much money in those
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.040]   situations.
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.240]   So if you want to increase your earning ability, you have to develop your human capital.
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.600]   You have to develop your skills.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.440]   So that comes in a number of different ways.
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.000]   It might come with academic credentialization.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.240]   Getting a high school degree, finishing your GED could possibly be a solution.
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.680]   It might come with getting a college degree.
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.120]   You're going to have an easier time getting a job if you have a college degree than if
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.120]   you don't have a college degree.
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.160]   Might come with having an advanced degree.
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.680]   It's probably going to be easier in many cases for you to get a job if you have an advanced
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.560]   master's degree than if you only have a bachelor's degree or if you only have a high school
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.800]   diploma.
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.080]   It's going to be easier for you if you have additional industry-level credentials.
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.880]   So maybe you want to become a welder, and so you pursue some kinds of welding credentials.
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.160]   Or possibly you're a financial planner, and so you have a certified financial planner
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.760]   designation, etc.
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.880]   So you're a graphic designer, and you get some certificate from a known graphic design
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:00.880]   firm.
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.120]   These forms of credentialization are useful, and they move you dramatically up the earning
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.120]   chart.
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.040]   You're likely able to demand more money.
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.600]   You're likely able to get paid more money, and they'll reduce your time spent on unemployment
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.840]   and make life generally easier for you.
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.480]   But the real magic comes when you don't just stop with the mainstream stuff.
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.040]   When you additionally develop other skills and abilities.
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.960]   I like how Scott Adams uses the term "the talent stack."
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.520]   You develop a thick talent stack.
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.520]   And so maybe you have some experience with marketing.
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.680]   Well that makes you more marketable.
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.240]   Maybe you have some experience with a certain expertise in a certain software program.
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.260]   Makes you more marketable.
[00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.920]   But one of the things that you can often do is bring in additional language ability.
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:48.920]   Makes you more marketable.
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:55.620]   Say, for example, you have a college degree in marketing, and you have some real experience
[00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.920]   in the world of advanced marketing.
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.360]   But now you want to go and get a job, but in addition to that you have a foreign language
[00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:03.360]   ability.
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.040]   Maybe you're skilled and bilingual in Spanish and English, or Chinese and English, or it
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.040]   can be anything.
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.080]   Serbo-Croatian and English.
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.000]   Or some value.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.960]   Now you can reach a more interesting market, and you're more valuable.
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:23.400]   If you come into a bilingual social media marketing management role, just the fact of
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.480]   your bilingualism will probably mean that you can negotiate a $10,000 or $15,000 or
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.800]   $20,000 or $50,000 increased salary.
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.520]   Even in fairly simple jobs, you'll find that being bilingual is very useful.
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.400]   Number of years ago when I was just out of high school, I spent some time managing a
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.720]   tree nursery.
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.760]   And one of the things that was useful that helped me get the job was I spoke both Spanish
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.180]   and English.
[00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:52.600]   And so I was a white, native American English speaker.
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:59.560]   But because I was Spanish, I was able to easily integrate and interface with all Spanish speaking
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:05.100]   all of our employees, were all Mexican and Guatemalan migrant workers in the tree nursery.
[00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:10.160]   The other foreman was a Mexican, but he spoke excellent English.
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:15.600]   And one of the big reasons that he was a foreman was simply his bilingual ability.
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:22.060]   And so you can just see how obvious it is that a white owners, American owners who didn't
[00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:23.960]   speak a lot of Spanish, they needed go-betweens.
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:30.280]   And so in his case, his name was Fernando, he was a good manager, but it was primarily
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:35.320]   his bilingualism that allowed him to be an effective interface and allowed him to make
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:40.040]   a lot more than the other guys were making, which put him in a much better financial situation.
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:44.000]   So if you're a welder and you're working with a lot of Spanish speaking guys, it makes a
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   big difference.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.240]   If you're a landscaper, one of the simplest things, I used to work with a lot of Spanish
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.240]   immigrants in the United States.
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.400]   And I always say, guys, take your English seriously.
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:59.800]   If you're working and you're hired as an entry level Guatemalan immigrant, and you only speak
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:04.640]   Spanish, you're going to cap out your wages at 15 bucks an hour.
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:09.360]   But if you can just simply learn English, you'll very quickly end up things like having
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.520]   a driver's license, having a good driver's license is in good standing and knowing how
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.840]   to back a trailer, you quickly move into a foreman role, into a management role, three
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:18.840]   basic skills.
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:24.360]   And I used to teach the guys, and I tell it to you, so it helped other people.
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:31.840]   The three basic things to make it to double your income, if you're starting as a low wage
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:39.080]   kind of entry level worker, is going to be having, I guess I should add more than three,
[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.160]   the four.
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.880]   Number one, being a legal resident, that makes a huge difference in your earning ability
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:47.520]   of being a legal resident versus not being a legal resident.
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.000]   So number one, legal resident.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.360]   Number two, having a clean driver's license, having a no accident history.
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.920]   I had a friend of mine who had a job, he was a foreman of a crew, had an accident, he got
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:02.480]   laid off from his job because the owner of the company couldn't afford the insurance
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.120]   anymore because of the accident that he had.
[00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.000]   It was his fault accident.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.760]   And so the insurance rates spiked and he got laid off because he didn't have a clean driver's
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:10.760]   record.
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.400]   It was a stupid thing to allow to happen.
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:18.080]   Of course, things happen, but having a clean driver's record.
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.960]   The thing I used to say in landscaping was know how to back a trailer, know how to drive
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:23.800]   a trailer without backing the thing into the ditch.
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.320]   If you talk to any owner of a landscaping company, one of the hardest things is finding
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:31.340]   somebody who can actually just drive the trailer properly and safely and not put the trailer
[00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:33.760]   into a ditch with thousands of dollars of equipment.
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:37.860]   And then number four, speaking English, being able to actually speak English.
[00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:42.560]   It dramatically improves the marketability of somebody's ability to interface with customers,
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:45.960]   the ability to be a go-between, to manage crews, et cetera.
[00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:51.000]   And so I've seen in those kinds of jobs, bilingualism is incredibly valuable.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.120]   Now, if you're listening to the show, you're of course either speak English or are learning
[00:07:55.120 --> 00:08:01.280]   English and certainly without a doubt, English is the single most important language that
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.080]   you can learn on a global basis.
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:07.320]   English is the number one most widely spoken language in the world.
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:12.720]   It is the lingua franca, the common third language in any kind of professional context,
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:15.960]   about 1.2 billion English speakers around the world.
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:23.400]   And without a doubt, it is probably the single best thing that any person anywhere in the
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:29.680]   world can do is learn English to enhance their marketability and enhance their job opportunities.
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:35.080]   You and I probably as native English speakers probably have an advantage, a real privilege
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:41.320]   that it comes easily to us because we're probably native speakers.
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.160]   But things go the other way as well.
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:47.080]   Learning additional languages as a native English speaker will additionally enhance
[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:52.240]   your marketability, especially if you are a culturally native English speaker.
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:57.080]   Somebody who can go back and forth from the United States to China and speak fluent Chinese
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:02.680]   and fluent English and who can understand the cultural interface is going to be very,
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:03.680]   very marketable.
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:07.720]   So over the years, I've become convinced that one of the best things that you can do for
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:10.720]   your earning ability is develop additional language ability.
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:15.640]   It really hinders people who don't develop additional language ability if they're involved
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:16.920]   in that kind of context.
[00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:20.560]   Now, that's the financial context, but there are many other reasons to study languages,
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:23.880]   even just to keep yourself smart.
[00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:30.400]   One of the most important forms of exercise that you can do for your high quality of life
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.380]   is to exercise your brain.
[00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:35.760]   You want to get a little bit smarter every day, and the way that you get smarter is to
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:39.200]   make your brain work hard.
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:42.640]   If you don't keep your brain working hard, it seems to decay.
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:47.000]   It seems to atrophy, just like your muscles, your physical muscles.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.960]   The brain is a muscle that needs to be exercised.
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:55.900]   There's good evidence, although it's not overwhelming, I've read good evidence from the medical people
[00:09:55.900 --> 00:10:02.880]   that say that anything that you can do to keep your brain exercised is going to enhance
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:07.840]   the longevity of your brain and your quality of living throughout your lifetime.
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:11.520]   There's evidence of just simply people being engaged in the social environments.
[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:14.880]   One of the reasons why I think retirement can be very dangerous for people in their
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:19.880]   mental health has to be navigated very carefully if you're going to retire from your job.
[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:24.120]   Retirement can be very dangerous, but you can also keep your brain engaged with additional
[00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:25.120]   studies.
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.240]   You can study hard things to learn new things.
[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:29.120]   It doesn't have to be in a foreign language.
[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:33.240]   You can be engaged with subjects that are keeping you stretching out and keeping you
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:34.240]   learning.
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:40.840]   But one effective way to keep your brain working is to always be learning an additional language.
[00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:47.560]   There's good evidence that multilingual people seem to experience delayed onset of mental
[00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:49.320]   diseases like Alzheimer's.
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:50.520]   Very, very useful.
[00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:54.800]   So learning languages can be useful from a physical perspective.
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:58.160]   Other benefits as well is the ability to integrate culturally with other people.
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.160]   It's really fun.
[00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:02.920]   It's much more fun to go to a country and visit and travel when you speak the language
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:05.720]   or at least a little bit of it than when if you're a total outsider.
[00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:08.520]   It can be really interesting and help with your empathy.
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:12.880]   I really appreciate one of the things that I've learned a lot over the years is I've
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:17.880]   been able to develop a lot more empathy from multilingualism by being able to travel and
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:22.400]   being able to get to know people genuinely and have them open up to you.
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:27.720]   You know, I talked about my experience with immigrants to the United States, with Spanish-speaking
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:28.720]   immigrants.
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:33.820]   It's always been much easier for me to interact with Spanish-speaking immigrants to the United
[00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:37.840]   States than many of my friends because I can speak Spanish.
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:42.420]   I can interact with them and I can find out what it's like to live in their shoes and
[00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:46.520]   ask the questions that you're always curious about but that you wouldn't be able to get
[00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:50.240]   answers to if you couldn't cross that language barrier.
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:56.000]   Many many reasons including financial reasons to learn a second language, learn an additional
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.680]   language.
[00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:03.880]   And I want to focus most of today's talk on just some practical tools that I have found
[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:05.040]   useful.
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:11.940]   But I do want to address kind of how and why, just the reasons why you should want to in
[00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:16.000]   addition to these basic reasons and how you can actually do it.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:23.200]   Because we do genuinely live right now in a golden age for almost everything.
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:27.320]   We live in a golden age for almost everything, we really do.
[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:28.320]   Including language learning.
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:30.160]   We live in a golden age of language learning.
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:33.320]   I think that things will get better in the future for language learning but I don't know
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.320]   how.
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.640]   I think they will but I don't know how.
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:41.560]   Certainly people would say, "Well, it'll get better for not needing to do language learning,
[00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:44.000]   simultaneous machine translation."
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.280]   We're already living in that.
[00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:46.960]   It's being tested, it's effective.
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:51.400]   Right now you can take your cell phone with you and you can pull out Google Translate,
[00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:55.360]   you can hit the button, you can speak it and it'll spit out the language translation on
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.360]   the other side.
[00:12:56.360 --> 00:13:01.680]   That is true and that's going to increasingly be a force for connectedness around the world
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:06.640]   as we increasingly have real-time machine translation of languages.
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:08.200]   But I'm talking about actual language learning.
[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:09.600]   We live in a golden age.
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:16.720]   Some of these tools that I'm going to describe to you are wonderful and make things incredibly
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:20.200]   easier than they were a decade ago.
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.360]   I want you to take advantage of that.
[00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:26.760]   But in this golden age, at the end of the day, you've got to decide why you're going
[00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:27.760]   to do something.
[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:34.480]   I've become convinced that the single – maybe that's too strong – a major distinction
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:38.840]   between people who will be successful in the coming decades and people who are not is just
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:43.040]   going to come down to motivation, desire, simple desire.
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:48.920]   And the master skill that you can develop in yourself is the ability to focus your desire,
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:55.160]   to increase your desire so that you experience motivation in ways that other people don't.
[00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:56.280]   My wife and I have an ongoing thing.
[00:13:56.280 --> 00:14:01.320]   I give her business idea after business idea and one of the common themes I tell her, "Oh
[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:07.160]   look, this would be an interesting business idea right here in this particular area and
[00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:08.560]   here's how I would learn it."
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:10.680]   For example, I think about it with restaurants.
[00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:14.240]   We travel a lot and sometimes you miss certain kinds of cuisine.
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:18.820]   And I've become convinced that I could move almost anywhere in the world and set up a
[00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:24.840]   foreign cuisine restaurant that was superb even if I didn't know how to cook the food.
[00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:31.000]   Because you can learn the intricacies of any cuisine in the world right now on YouTube.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.760]   I'm not Italian.
[00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:35.400]   I don't particularly love cooking Italian food.
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:37.680]   I'm not great at cooking Italian food.
[00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:46.320]   But I could become a world-class Italian chef with a few months of practice and the information
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:48.440]   that's easily available on YouTube.
[00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:52.440]   And I could move to downtown Beijing and open the world's best Italian restaurant.
[00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:56.400]   I would adopt an Italian accent so that everyone thought I was actually Italian, which I can
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:15:02.200]   also learn on YouTube for free to speak my English with an Italian accent and a few chosen
[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:06.120]   Italian phrases and I could be an Italian immigrant to Beijing with the best Italian
[00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:07.480]   restaurant in town.
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:14.880]   Now, I'm of course grandstanding a little bit, but I genuinely do mean it.
[00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:19.040]   You can learn because the information is now widely available.
[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:24.200]   And in the information age, it's not access to information that distinguishes those who
[00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:25.200]   succeed.
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:29.880]   It's largely motivation and those who are actually willing to learn the skills and make
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:33.040]   the information that's out there truly theirs.
[00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:34.760]   This can be done in almost any industry.
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:40.480]   I just use cooking because it's easy and it's a fairly universal language.
[00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.520]   We all like to eat, I think.
[00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:44.720]   And it's fun.
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:45.720]   It's fun.
[00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:47.600]   But that's the point, is that you need the motivation.
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:50.320]   And so with language learning, it's exactly the same thing.
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:55.200]   The thing that keeps people from not effectively learning languages is not skill.
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:56.200]   It's not ability.
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:57.520]   It's motivation.
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:59.200]   It's the actual motivation.
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:03.320]   If you have motivation, you figure out a way that works for you.
[00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:08.560]   My ways might not work for you, but if you have motivation, you'll figure out how to
[00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:09.960]   speak the language.
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:12.320]   You'll figure it out.
[00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:15.480]   There are so many of us who come from immigrant families, the families that moved to the United
[00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:18.320]   States and had motivation and learned English.
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:22.160]   There's so many immigrants who go abroad and have motivation and learn the local language.
[00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:24.800]   And you've got to figure out how to motivate yourself.
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:29.520]   And that's going to be the key distinction between your effectiveness with language learning.
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:31.400]   It's not going to be a matter of skill.
[00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:32.920]   It's going to be a matter of motivation.
[00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:38.840]   It's why you kind of see that a guy moves to Spain and falls in love with a beautiful
[00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:41.160]   Spanish woman who only speaks Spanish.
[00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:44.800]   And all of a sudden, three months later, the dude's fluent in Spanish.
[00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:51.080]   Meanwhile, you've got some guy who sits in class in three years of high school Spanish
[00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:57.160]   and three years out the other end, he can only say, "Buenos dias, como estas?"
[00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:58.160]   And that's about it.
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:01.640]   It all comes down to motivation, motivation to learn a language.
[00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:05.640]   So I don't know how to help you with motivation.
[00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:10.640]   You kind of got to know yourself and understand what is going to motivate you and then put
[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:18.920]   in place structures of reward for yourself that go based upon your own motivation.
[00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:24.000]   One of again, those mega skills that you can develop is the skill of self-knowledge, self-awareness
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.040]   to understand your own psychology and figure out what's going to work for you and what's
[00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:29.520]   not going to work for you.
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:33.720]   And if you can harness the power of understanding what works for you, you can put in place plans
[00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:40.000]   in anything that will help you to achieve the things that you want to achieve.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.280]   I want to bust a myth though, and then I'll give you some tools.
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:50.080]   In addition to the positive side of motivation, there are some negative things that you'll
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:51.680]   have to overcome.
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:56.000]   Perhaps you're an English speaker and you're 55 years old, you've never learned a second
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.920]   language.
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:05.620]   The chances are you may need to overcome some limiting beliefs, some lies that you may have
[00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:08.880]   believed that have kept you down.
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:15.460]   And two of the most common ones is I'm just not good at languages and it's easier for
[00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:16.460]   young people.
[00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:19.360]   So the first one, I'm not good at languages.
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:24.740]   This is a total myth, a complete and total myth.
[00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:29.480]   Everybody in the world is good at languages.
[00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:33.840]   My evidence for that is everywhere in the world, little babies come into the world with
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:39.880]   no ability to speak or understand languages other than a little bit of nonverbal communication
[00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:41.200]   and they learn local language.
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:48.800]   No matter how hard it is, no matter how complex, human beings are language machines.
[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:51.800]   We're made in the image of God and God is a God who speaks.
[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:59.520]   It's one of the key distinctions about God is God is a God who speaks and thus we're
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:02.040]   language learning machines.
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:06.720]   There's almost no limit to the language capacity of a human being.
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:09.440]   There's no limit to the number of languages that you could speak.
[00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:15.520]   There are people out there who can speak dozens and dozens of languages with very high levels
[00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:17.160]   of fluency.
[00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:23.680]   Really the only limitation is the amount of time to learn, the amount of time to learn
[00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:28.160]   and to practice and we're all limited by our need to sleep and the 24 hours that we have
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:29.300]   in a day.
[00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:34.440]   But beyond that there's almost no limit to the human capacity for languages.
[00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:39.400]   Now some people are more effective than others.
[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:42.680]   Sometimes that's because of some form of natural ability.
[00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:44.260]   I noticed this with my wife.
[00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:48.880]   My wife seems far more capable than I am with regard to language ability.
[00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:55.140]   It annoys me sometimes because she'll hear a word one time and she'll remember that word
[00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:56.560]   basically forever.
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:59.920]   I need to drill the word dozens of times to beat it into my head.
[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:03.600]   I look at her and I just I sometimes tell her, "You waste this ability that you have
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:05.800]   because you don't work on it very much."
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:09.640]   I speak better than she does a lot of times because I work a lot harder but I think she's
[00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:11.840]   more naturally skilled than I am.
[00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:17.120]   So some people do have some natural skills but all of us can develop some skill.
[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:18.280]   All of us can do it.
[00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:22.240]   The key thing I think usually that separates people who are skilled at learning languages
[00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:25.240]   is the process of learning how to learn it, learning what works.
[00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:29.840]   Which is why oftentimes if you speak to somebody who speaks multiple languages, a polyglot,
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:33.760]   a lot of times it's easier for someone to learn their third or fourth language than
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:36.200]   it was for them to learn their second.
[00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:37.680]   This is the same with almost anything.
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:41.580]   It's probably easier for many people to earn a PhD than it was for them to earn their high
[00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:45.200]   school degree, depending on the context of course.
[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:49.100]   Because when you're learning something new, you have to develop some new skills of learning
[00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:50.160]   how to learn.
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:51.800]   With languages, it's no different.
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:55.160]   So if you're just, you speak one language, you're an English speaker and you want to
[00:20:55.160 --> 00:21:00.240]   sit down and learn a second language, it's going to take time for you to figure out what
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:02.860]   routine is effective for me.
[00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:04.760]   What helps me to develop this language ability?
[00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:09.080]   But once you've learned that with your second language, then you could add a third one and
[00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:12.020]   a fourth one and every one will get easier.
[00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:13.020]   Same thing with money, right?
[00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:14.560]   The first million is the hardest.
[00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:15.560]   Why?
[00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:21.400]   Well, there are some practical reasons that starting without any capital is harder than
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:23.400]   starting with capital.
[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:27.080]   But there's also a whole set of skills, a whole set of mindsets, a whole set of ways
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:29.480]   of thinking that you've got to develop.
[00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:33.640]   If you start from zero, to go from zero to a million dollars, to become a millionaire
[00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:36.760]   requires a complete transformation of who you are.
[00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:41.360]   But once you're a millionaire, to get another million dollars saved up just requires you
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:46.320]   to do a little bit more of what you've already done, to become a little bit more of who you
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:47.720]   already are.
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:50.120]   And so things get easier with time.
[00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:53.720]   Now the second, so the first myth is, "Oh, I'm just not good at languages."
[00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:57.560]   Everybody can learn languages if you have the motivation.
[00:21:57.560 --> 00:21:59.280]   Now the second thing is you'll say, "Oh, it's just easy.
[00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:00.760]   It's harder when you get older."
[00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:05.480]   I'm thankful that this is a myth that the language research has pretty well debunked,
[00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:08.380]   pretty well exploded over the last years.
[00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:12.560]   It's one of the most widely held myths that it's easier for children to learn foreign
[00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:13.560]   languages.
[00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:19.960]   I am teaching my children foreign languages and I'm convinced it's completely false.
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:27.800]   It's harder to teach children foreign languages than it is an adult.
[00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:35.960]   Because children basically only have, small children basically only have one way of learning
[00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:40.840]   and that's passive absorption instead of dedicated study.
[00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:45.680]   What children do have at a young age is lots of time and they basically don't have to do
[00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:47.360]   anything else with their time.
[00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:51.840]   Our children when they're born into the world, they come into the world and we do everything
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:52.920]   for them.
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:54.400]   We change their diapers, we feed them.
[00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:57.680]   They have no responsibilities other than to sit around and learn.
[00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:01.120]   And basically all they need to do is learn how to talk and learn how to walk.
[00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:05.640]   And so they have all the time in the world and they absorb, absorb, absorb, and absorb,
[00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:09.320]   but their actual learning process is extraordinarily slow.
[00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:14.400]   The time it takes for your child to start spitting out intelligible sentences is a very
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:15.640]   long time.
[00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:19.240]   Starting from zero, what, they start about 18 months to start making intelligible sentences,
[00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:20.680]   two years old.
[00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:26.200]   Whereas you and I in 18 minutes we can make intelligible sentences in a foreign language.
[00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:30.120]   So adults can learn far faster than children can.
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:33.820]   Adults just usually don't have as much time as children do have.
[00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:39.320]   If I brought you into my house and I fed you and I watered you and I met to all of your
[00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:46.640]   physical needs and I said your only job for 24 hours a day, your only job is to learn
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:53.000]   this other language, give yourself a few months, you could be fluently speaking another language.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.580]   Far faster than a child.
[00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:59.040]   So it's a matter of the amount of time that an adult has to invest.
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:02.600]   An adult has the ability to learn much more effectively than a child because an adult
[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:07.560]   can take part of different material, an adult can study, an adult can review, an adult has
[00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:12.640]   all kinds of learning systems at their fingertips that make an adult's progress much better
[00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:15.520]   and much faster than a child.
[00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:20.680]   So now on the foundation of my busting those two myths, I want to encourage you, you can
[00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:22.240]   learn another language.
[00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:26.040]   No matter how many languages you've learned, you can learn another language if you want
[00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:30.700]   to, if you have the motivation and you can learn it quickly if you have the right tools
[00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:34.540]   and the right facilities, the right materials.
[00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:40.360]   So I don't want to give you a lecture on all of how to learn a language.
[00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:43.840]   It's beyond my skill set and the internet is your friend.
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:48.080]   There are many qualified language teachers out there that will give you their experience
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:52.840]   and I'm not the world's greatest polyglot, although my ambition is to be a decent polyglot,
[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:57.680]   but it's just an ambition, it's not a reality and I've had the same struggles that you've
[00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:58.680]   had.
[00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:00.800]   There have been times when I've learned a lot and there have been times when I've gone
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:07.600]   years without learning anything, but we really do live in a golden age of language acquisition
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:12.680]   and I want to give you some tools that I think will help you if you are studying another
[00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:13.680]   language.
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:17.520]   These are tools that I think are completely game changing.
[00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:23.080]   The first thing that you need to do is you need to develop a strategy for language learning.
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:31.760]   What I think makes a lot of sense as a strategy for learning languages is learning words.
[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:37.160]   If you can learn words and learn what words mean and if you learn enough words, you'll
[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:39.160]   learn a language.
[00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:46.120]   Now the natural acquisition of words is going to start with listening and then for adults,
[00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:50.000]   a huge benefit that we have is of reading.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.240]   You need to listen to words and you need to read words.
[00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:58.520]   If you are someone who is bilingual or more, you'll know that the most common thing that
[00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:02.720]   someone says to you when they find out you speak another language is, "Oh yeah, you know,
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:07.560]   I am interested or I speak a little bit of this other language, but I can understand
[00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:08.880]   better than I can speak."
[00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:12.820]   It's always what someone says because it's always true.
[00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:16.640]   You can always understand better than you can speak.
[00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:19.320]   That's a natural part of language.
[00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:23.920]   And so language learning often starts with learning to understand and then learning to
[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:27.280]   speak does come on down the road.
[00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:31.440]   You have to learn to understand words and that means learning new words.
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:37.040]   And so you need some methodology to start to study and to learn new words.
[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:41.640]   Now that methodology doesn't have to be complex, but you do need something.
[00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:46.240]   And the key thing that you want is you want what the language people call comprehensible
[00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:47.520]   input.
[00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:51.400]   You want to have something that you can understand.
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:58.560]   If I put on a movie in Chinese and I just put the movie on and it's all Chinese, you
[00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:04.680]   won't, unless you, assuming you haven't studied Chinese, you won't understand, right?
[00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:05.680]   Because it's just too much.
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:07.440]   It's too much language.
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:13.280]   But if you go into the local Chinese food restaurant that you really love to get takeout
[00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:19.400]   and every time you walk in to that restaurant to get your Chinese takeout and you say, you
[00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:22.920]   know, hi or howdy or good afternoon or however you greet people in English.
[00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:28.120]   And if the Chinese person behind the counter said, "Ni hao" and responded with, with "Ni
[00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:31.960]   hao" every time, pretty soon you would figure out that "Ni hao" is a greeting, right?
[00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:32.960]   It's a greeting.
[00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:35.880]   You understand that because they always say exactly the same thing.
[00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:39.400]   And you've got two little words, two little tones that are pretty easy for you to listen
[00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:41.640]   to and you can understand.
[00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:48.160]   And then if somebody tells you, you know, "Xie xie" that you should say, thank you.
[00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:50.800]   And they say, and you say, how do I say thank you?
[00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:55.120]   And they say "Xie xie" and every time you get something you say thank you in Chinese,
[00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:56.400]   then pretty soon you're going to learn that.
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:58.240]   You've got comprehensible input.
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:00.400]   And this is how children learn as well.
[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:05.800]   When we deal with our children and we're teaching them language, we speak to them in the context
[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:07.760]   of something that they can understand.
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:11.560]   So if I'm telling my child, you know, put this over there, I'm going to use my fingers,
[00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:13.760]   I'm going to gesture, put this over there.
[00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:19.040]   And they're understanding by the tone of voice, by the situation that we're in, put this over
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:20.040]   there.
[00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:23.760]   They understand that put this over there means I need to take this thing over there.
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:26.720]   And they can tell that by the way that I'm communicating.
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:31.120]   Or if I bake a loaf of bread and I butter a piece of bread and I get it out of the oven
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:34.480]   and it's hot and it's butter and I hold it out in my hand and I say, would you like a
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:35.480]   piece of bread?
[00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:36.680]   Or would you like a cookie?
[00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:39.600]   They're understanding, okay, this is bread and this is cookie.
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:43.400]   And daddy's saying, would you like this?
[00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:44.980]   It's comprehensible.
[00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:48.840]   And so what you've got to do is you've got to find something that's going to be comprehensible
[00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:49.840]   to you.
[00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:54.640]   And most of the time, this starts with simple words, simple phrases, learning buenos dias,
[00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:59.520]   buenas tardes, you know, these basic things and learning them in their context.
[00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:05.780]   And so you've got to find some kind of material that's going to help you to gain some basic
[00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:08.520]   comprehensibility.
[00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:11.880]   Now the world of this kind of material is wide open to you.
[00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:15.200]   You can pick up a phrase book if it's a language that you can read.
[00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:18.640]   For example, a language like Spanish, which is easy to learn to read, you can pick up
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:21.180]   a simple phrase book and start memorizing some phrases.
[00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:24.040]   You probably know some simple Spanish phrases.
[00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:27.760]   You know that buenos dias means good morning and buenas tardes means good afternoon and
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:31.000]   como estas, you know, you know these things because you've heard them and they're very,
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   very simple.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.360]   Well, you can start there.
[00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:36.580]   I think it's very effective to start with some audio courses.
[00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:41.740]   Years ago when I was driving a lot, I would go to the library and I would get from the
[00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:45.820]   library all the Pimsleur courses and all the Pimsleur courses in all the different languages
[00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:48.260]   start off the same way.
[00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:50.780]   They start with these basic phrases, just greetings.
[00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:56.100]   I remember one time I had gone through the Pimsleur Chinese course and I had learned,
[00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:58.980]   you know, eight phrases and I was in China.
[00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:05.480]   And I'm sitting there in China and I was like, "Okay, I'm going to try out my Chinese phrases."
[00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:07.820]   And it was the most fun thing in the world.
[00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:09.900]   Ni hao, wo hui shuai yi jie putonghua.
[00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:12.620]   You know, like starting off with the basic stuff.
[00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:16.420]   And I got to the end of my six phrases and the Chinese person is sitting there just coming
[00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:20.100]   back at me at rapid fire and I'm just sitting there dumbfounded because I've completely
[00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:24.240]   lost all, I exhausted my six phrases in Chinese.
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:27.420]   But it's a good place to start because it gets you the ability to start.
[00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:31.060]   And so you can pick almost anything, almost any introductory course and start it.
[00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:33.280]   And I recommend that you just pick something.
[00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:37.820]   You can pick something online, you can pick some podcast, you know, Coffee Break Spanish
[00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:42.440]   or Coffee Break French or, you know, pick up a Pimsleur course or a living language
[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:44.200]   course or go to the library and try it.
[00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:46.160]   Almost anything can start you.
[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:49.760]   And once you start to get a couple of phrases, you realize that you can learn a couple of
[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:50.760]   phrases.
[00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:53.000]   And if you can learn a couple of phrases and a couple of words, you can learn thousands
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.260]   of phrases and thousands of words.
[00:30:55.260 --> 00:31:00.620]   The good thing about most languages is you don't need that many words to be able to carry
[00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:02.840]   on a basic conversation.
[00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:05.520]   The English language has the largest lexicon in the world.
[00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:09.240]   I think it's something like 250,000 words right now and growing.
[00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:16.800]   So English is without a doubt the hardest language in the world to learn massively because
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:21.940]   the lexicon, the number of words that are present is the biggest in the world.
[00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:26.680]   My English vocabulary, I did took a vocab test, my English vocabulary is probably something
[00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:30.020]   like 30 to 35,000 words was an estimate I took recently.
[00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:36.720]   I don't even know a tenth, I mean I guess I know maybe 15% of the entire English lexicon.
[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:43.920]   But the lexis of other languages is much, much, much, much smaller.
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:44.920]   See what I did there?
[00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:48.460]   I just mixed it up on you and used two different words for the same thing.
[00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:51.500]   Lexicon and lexis, same word.
[00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:55.880]   The lexicon of other languages is much, much smaller.
[00:31:55.880 --> 00:32:00.780]   So I think I've heard estimates that French has a lexis of maybe 50,000 words and Spanish
[00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:02.740]   something like 30 to 50,000 words.
[00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:06.740]   But you don't need even a fraction of those to carry on a basic conversation.
[00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:12.360]   A basic conversation can be easily had with some estimates a thousand words, some estimates
[00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:14.100]   a few thousand words.
[00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:20.560]   If you develop a few thousand words in a foreign language, you'll be able to pick up a newspaper
[00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:25.380]   and read and understand 85% of the words that are written in that language.
[00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:30.100]   And so a few thousand words is a very doable target if you can figure out a way to learn
[00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:31.320]   words.
[00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:33.780]   And so that's your goal is to learn words.
[00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:36.740]   Now here's some of the tools that have been effective for me over the years.
[00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:40.020]   Number one, I do like audio-based courses.
[00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:44.260]   I listen well and I can often hear things and so I like audio-based courses that turn
[00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:46.460]   drive time into learning time.
[00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:48.980]   I've done this with a bunch of languages.
[00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:52.180]   Some of it sticks, some of it doesn't, but it's really fun to be able to say hello in
[00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:53.860]   a dozen or two languages.
[00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:57.240]   And you can learn that with just going through a few Pimsleur CDs that you can get from your
[00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:58.660]   local library.
[00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:03.220]   And so I like to do some of the audio-based languages.
[00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:08.460]   Where I find the audio-based languages for me stop working is once we get past the first
[00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:10.260]   introductions.
[00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:14.660]   But if you want to pick up a Portuguese CD or a Chinese CD and play it in your car where
[00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:19.220]   you're going back and forth from work, you can get your few basic introductions.
[00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:22.820]   And that gets you started on learning a language.
[00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:24.960]   Really really valuable.
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:29.960]   What I find to be incredibly valuable is the use of flashcards.
[00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:33.080]   For me flashcards are a key thing.
[00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:38.300]   But over the years I've learned what flashcards work and what flashcards don't work.
[00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:40.660]   I speak relatively fluent Spanish.
[00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:50.380]   One of my goals this year is I'm working and studying hard for an advanced level Spanish
[00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:51.460]   diploma.
[00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:55.580]   And I've got a lot of work to do to get there, but I'm working really hard towards that.
[00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:57.380]   But I've never had...
[00:33:57.380 --> 00:34:01.580]   I've had almost no formal instruction in Spanish.
[00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:05.340]   In fact my formal instruction in Spanish is limited to two years of high school Spanish
[00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:10.300]   and then about a month and a half of instruction when I was in Costa Rica in college.
[00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:11.420]   That's it.
[00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:18.300]   But when I arrived in Costa Rica in college after two years of high school Spanish, I
[00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:23.780]   was able to carry on fluent conversations in ordinary circumstances in Spanish.
[00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:27.260]   And the secret was twofold.
[00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:30.500]   Number one, I spoke with people.
[00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:33.140]   And number two, I used flashcards.
[00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:35.420]   Start with number one, speaking to people.
[00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:40.620]   What I observed and have observed over the years is that if you want to genuinely learn
[00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:44.260]   a language, you've got to actually use it.
[00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:48.180]   And the thing that keeps people back from learning a language is fear of looking and
[00:34:48.180 --> 00:34:49.980]   sounding stupid.
[00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:54.860]   And every advanced language learner that I've ever listened to and learned from has just
[00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:57.020]   simply overcome that fear.
[00:34:57.020 --> 00:35:03.900]   Has been willing to just simply look and sound stupid.
[00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:05.460]   We all experience that fear.
[00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:11.540]   A moment ago when I'm trying to say, "I can speak a little Mandarin."
[00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:12.540]   That's Mandarin Chinese.
[00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:14.900]   It means I speak a little bit of Chinese.
[00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:16.740]   A little bit of Mandarin Chinese.
[00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:19.620]   But I have no idea if I do that well or not.
[00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:25.100]   It's scary for me to record myself when I know I have fluent Chinese speakers and I
[00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:26.100]   haven't yet learned Chinese.
[00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:28.540]   And so I don't know if I speak it well or not.
[00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:32.120]   But that fear is just as present in me as it is in everyone else.
[00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:35.460]   I've just learned over the years that there's no point in succumbing to that fear.
[00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:37.820]   You just have to act in spite of it.
[00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:41.260]   And I only ever had two years of high school Spanish, but what I always did was I always
[00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:43.700]   practiced speaking to people.
[00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:47.300]   And whenever I had the chance to practice with Spanish speakers, I would do it.
[00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:49.580]   And if you just do that, you'll get better.
[00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:52.840]   Same thing when immigrants come to an English speaking country.
[00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:56.980]   If they will be willing to try, they make progress.
[00:35:56.980 --> 00:36:01.660]   But if they sit back and are scared to look stupid or sound stupid, they don't make progress.
[00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:03.100]   For me, the other thing was flashcards.
[00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:09.340]   The one thing I did was I went to Barnes and Noble and I bought a box of a thousand flashcards,
[00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:10.860]   thousand Spanish word flashcards.
[00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:13.100]   They still sell it, the blue box.
[00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:15.660]   And I learned those thousand flashcards.
[00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:18.300]   And on one side was an English word, on the other side was a Spanish word.
[00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:19.800]   I memorized them.
[00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:26.740]   And those thousand words gave me the ability to speak Spanish by memorizing the thousand
[00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:27.740]   words.
[00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:32.420]   Now, that was what totally changed me because I arrived when I was in college, I arrived
[00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:37.580]   to a study abroad program and I found out that I could speak and yet tons of other people
[00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:41.620]   couldn't speak because they didn't have enough vocabulary.
[00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:43.820]   And so flashcards work for me.
[00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:48.660]   Over the years, I've developed better techniques though with flashcards because although physical
[00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:54.100]   flashcards can work, they're not as good as some other systems.
[00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:58.420]   Another resource I'd recommend for you, Gabriel, I think his name is Weiner, wrote a book called
[00:36:58.420 --> 00:36:59.420]   Fluent Forever.
[00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:03.300]   He published it a few years ago, but it's a great book.
[00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:04.300]   Fluent Forever.
[00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:07.220]   He has a website fluent-forever.com.
[00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:12.580]   But basically the book is an introduction to language learning, but it's 50% or more
[00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:14.960]   here's how you make great flashcards.
[00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:18.700]   And there are a few components that you can use for great flashcards.
[00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:24.500]   The first thing, I prefer digital flashcards over paper flashcards.
[00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:29.700]   Paper flashcards can be useful, but digital flashcards are better because they can go
[00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:35.980]   into a digital flashcard system that utilizes spaced repetition learning.
[00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:40.420]   One of the things that I try to teach to high school students and to other students is how
[00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:47.300]   to harness the value of spaced repetition learning, a little bit of learning theory.
[00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:53.960]   You can remember almost anything in the world forever if you're reminded of it often enough.
[00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:57.100]   You're never going to forget your name because you're reminded of it all the time.
[00:37:57.100 --> 00:38:05.060]   You've used it all the time, but you might forget what an unusual word like supercilious
[00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:08.160]   means if you don't use it all the time.
[00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:11.860]   Think about all of the things that you studied in school.
[00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:18.020]   You learned what protozoa meant, but now although you might recognize the word, you probably
[00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:23.780]   don't really know what a protozoa actually is or what a dendrite actually is.
[00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:24.780]   You probably don't remember.
[00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:31.700]   You probably don't remember what the periodic table for ... You probably memorized when you
[00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:32.700]   were in school.
[00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:36.100]   You probably memorized the periodic table, but it would be unusual if you remembered
[00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:42.500]   what K meant or it would be unusual if you remembered what ... I can't even come up with
[00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:44.420]   the examples off the top of my head anymore.
[00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:47.220]   The more unusual rare earth metals were.
[00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:48.700]   They're chemical symbol.
[00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:54.700]   But if you used this stuff or if you were reminded on this stuff, you would remember.
[00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:59.740]   Example, when I was in high school, I memorized all of the capitals of the states and all
[00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:04.060]   the capitals of every country in the world, but I remember some of them, the ones that
[00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:07.100]   I used, but the other ones of them, I don't remember very much.
[00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:12.460]   But what you can do is if I put together a flashcard system and had you memorize all
[00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:18.620]   of the capitals of the world and you memorized them and then you reviewed them, say every
[00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:21.780]   three months or every six months or once a year, you would still know them.
[00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:24.540]   That information would still be in your head.
[00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:27.300]   That's basically what a spaced repetition system means.
[00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:28.580]   You can do this with a box.
[00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:29.780]   You can do it with a physical box.
[00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:33.380]   It's called a Liebner box or Leitner box, something like that.
[00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:37.580]   I can't remember the name because I don't care enough to put it in my flashcard system.
[00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:41.500]   But the better solution these days is to use an electronic system.
[00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:45.380]   And there are a number of different applications that use this basic system.
[00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:49.140]   The idea is you create a flashcard that has a piece of knowledge on it that you want to
[00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:52.580]   maintain and then you review that flashcard until you learn it.
[00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:58.140]   And then once you learn it, you allow a computer algorithm to feed that flashcard back to you
[00:39:58.140 --> 00:40:00.260]   right when you're about to forget it.
[00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:05.580]   So let's say that you're trying to memorize that the capital of France is Paris.
[00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:10.840]   We make a flashcard, Paris, France, and then you memorize that and then you review it every
[00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:11.980]   day for the next three days.
[00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:15.020]   Well, now you know that the capital of France is Paris.
[00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:18.340]   Then the flashcard system gives it to you in a week and you show it a week that you
[00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:19.440]   still remember it.
[00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:22.500]   Then the flashcard system gives it to you in a month and you show, yep, I still know
[00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:24.140]   this piece of information.
[00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:25.420]   Then in three months it gives it to you.
[00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:26.420]   Yep, I still know this.
[00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:27.660]   And yep, I still know this.
[00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:34.260]   And eventually that knowledge becomes part of your permanent memory.
[00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:39.060]   And at some point in time you'll never forget that the capital of France is Paris because
[00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:43.700]   you've been drilled on that enough times to where you'll never forget that little bit
[00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:44.700]   of data.
[00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:49.620]   Well, you can do that with France, but you can also do that with the capital of Serbia.
[00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:52.980]   You can also do it with the capital of Senegal.
[00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:58.100]   There doesn't have to be any reason why Paris, France is any more part of your permanent
[00:40:58.100 --> 00:41:01.780]   memory than another if you were reviewing those other things enough.
[00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:09.100]   And so the solution that I use for this is a computer program called Anki.
[00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:11.140]   And Anki, it's totally free if you use it.
[00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:16.260]   There is a paid version if you want to do mobile syncing with your mobile devices, but
[00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:18.600]   there's a totally free version that you install on your computer.
[00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:23.920]   And so for any kind of piece of data that you want to commit to memory, I think that
[00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:27.840]   you should put it into an Anki flashcard system that you review regularly.
[00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:33.160]   And you can do this with really anything, any piece of data.
[00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:37.540]   So school, studying in school, this should be the basis of how students study for tests.
[00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:43.100]   As you're going through and studying for an exam, you read a chapter and then you take
[00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:47.180]   all the bits of it and you take all the information, you make flashcards with it and you drill
[00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:50.060]   it until you memorize the key bits of information.
[00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:55.580]   And what I love about Anki especially is because it's all computer based, you can put anything
[00:41:55.580 --> 00:41:56.580]   into it.
[00:41:56.580 --> 00:41:59.160]   You can put video clips, literally.
[00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:00.780]   You can put audio.
[00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:03.180]   You can put pictures.
[00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:06.780]   You can make flashcards in any possible way.
[00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:10.520]   And so what I'll do is I do this sometimes with books that I'm seeking to master.
[00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:15.440]   And I'll take a book that I want to master and I'll say, and I'll turn it into flashcards.
[00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:20.220]   And so if you've got something that's really valuable, then you take it and you turn it
[00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:21.640]   into flashcards.
[00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:25.580]   And that's really, really useful.
[00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:29.180]   And you can drill something into your brain.
[00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:31.780]   It's one of the ways that I memorize outlines from books.
[00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:34.520]   You know, here are the three things, here are the five things.
[00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:38.700]   Take it, put it into a flashcard, drill it into your head until it becomes a part of
[00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:39.700]   you.
[00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:41.520]   And you can put screenshots.
[00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:45.140]   And so this is one of the reasons why I love digital books, where I'll take my books, read
[00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:46.140]   them digitally.
[00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:49.140]   I'll create a flashcard, ask the question and the answer.
[00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:52.380]   But then underneath the answer, I'll put a screenshot of that part of the book with it
[00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:57.620]   marked up, highlighted in all my marginalia, so I can imprint on my head where that information
[00:42:57.620 --> 00:42:58.740]   came from.
[00:42:58.740 --> 00:43:03.100]   And it's incredibly useful to you as a learning technique.
[00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:09.260]   Now with languages, what I have learned to do is follow the instructions laid out by
[00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:15.120]   Gabriel in Fluent Forever, where he talks about the specific bits of data that you want
[00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:16.580]   to be on a language flashcard.
[00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:21.900]   And over the years, I've struggled and struggled and struggled to master a vocabulary if it's
[00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:22.900]   just translation.
[00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:30.580]   If it's just, you know, on one side you have a card that says "house" and on the other
[00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:33.620]   side you have a word that says "casa".
[00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:35.420]   I just struggle to memorize that.
[00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:41.060]   And it's fine when it's "casa" and "house" because these are fairly common words.
[00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:46.140]   But what about when you get to words that are uncommon like "atisbo" and "estropearse"
[00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:47.860]   and like these more advanced vocabulary.
[00:43:47.860 --> 00:43:52.880]   I've drilled cards dozens and dozens and dozens of times and the words just don't seem to
[00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:55.140]   penetrate into my head.
[00:43:55.140 --> 00:44:00.240]   But when I read Fluent Forever and I started applying those techniques, it really improved
[00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:02.020]   my skills.
[00:44:02.020 --> 00:44:06.980]   And so here are some recommendations that the author of Fluent Forever makes for how
[00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:09.660]   to make flashcards.
[00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:11.980]   What you do is you make multiple flashcards for the same word.
[00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:15.420]   And he has a whole system that you can get in the book and you can download his templates
[00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:16.420]   for free.
[00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:17.780]   I highly recommend it to you.
[00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:20.060]   But now I make multiple flashcards for the same word.
[00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:25.740]   And what I do is I take a word, let's say it's a word that I'm trying to learn.
[00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:29.540]   I'll give you some words from my current Spanish studies.
[00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:32.860]   A word like "artasco".
[00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:35.060]   Artasco basically means satiety.
[00:44:35.060 --> 00:44:36.860]   But it's a very unusual word.
[00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:39.860]   It's not the kind of word that is used much.
[00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:44.860]   But if you're like "comer hasta el artasco", like to eat until you're satiated, it's an
[00:44:44.860 --> 00:44:46.100]   unusual word.
[00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:49.540]   And that's the kind of word that I really struggle to keep in my head because it's not
[00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:53.020]   something that I would use on a daily basis.
[00:44:53.020 --> 00:44:56.940]   It's not something that I have much of a connection to.
[00:44:56.940 --> 00:44:58.480]   And it's not a cognate.
[00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:02.900]   There's not a natural cognate between satiety and artasco.
[00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:07.540]   That's very different than a word like "feroz" and "ferocious" where there's an easy cognate
[00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:09.220]   and it's easy to remember.
[00:45:09.220 --> 00:45:13.300]   And so what I do is I create a series of cards.
[00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:16.860]   I follow the Fluent Forever model where I create several different cards.
[00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:20.380]   But I put on one side is the word "artasco".
[00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:23.340]   But then on the other side I use an image.
[00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:27.560]   And I find a picture of the word for "artasco".
[00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:28.560]   And I find something.
[00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:32.060]   I use Google Images and I drag the image from...
[00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:34.860]   Did I just say I use Google Images?
[00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:36.980]   I confess that sometimes I do use Google Images.
[00:45:36.980 --> 00:45:40.220]   I try to use DuckDuckGo Images but I confess I'm not a Google...
[00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:46.020]   I'm not perfectly free of Google for the non-Google folks in the audience.
[00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:49.820]   I don't use Google for searches but I do use it for image searches.
[00:45:49.820 --> 00:45:51.700]   So I'll use that and I'll get an idea of it.
[00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:54.900]   And part of the process is you have to make your own flashcards.
[00:45:54.900 --> 00:45:58.460]   Because when I'm actually trying to figure out what does a word like "artasco" mean,
[00:45:58.460 --> 00:45:59.460]   I go do a search.
[00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:00.460]   I go to images.google.es.
[00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:03.700]   I use for Spain.
[00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:06.900]   And I do a search for "artasco" and I try to understand.
[00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:10.100]   And I take a look at the articles that come up and I look at the images and I look at
[00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:14.060]   the words until I get a sense of what this word means emotionally.
[00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:15.060]   I try to feel it.
[00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:16.060]   I don't want to translate it.
[00:46:16.060 --> 00:46:20.180]   I don't want to just translate it directly because it doesn't just mean satiety.
[00:46:20.180 --> 00:46:23.620]   I want to get a feel for what does this weird word mean.
[00:46:23.620 --> 00:46:25.700]   And then create a flashcard with it.
[00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:26.700]   So I'll grab some images.
[00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:27.820]   And you can have one image.
[00:46:27.820 --> 00:46:29.220]   You can have five images.
[00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:31.740]   And I'll put those images on my flashcard.
[00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:35.860]   In addition, I'll go ahead and grab an audio recording of this.
[00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:38.300]   Now this is easy in Spanish.
[00:46:38.300 --> 00:46:41.860]   You don't really need this because Spanish is so easy to learn how to pronounce.
[00:46:41.860 --> 00:46:45.400]   But I struggle still with things like French pronunciation.
[00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:50.680]   So with my French flashcards, sometimes it's not intuitive to me how a word should be pronounced
[00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:51.680]   or Portuguese.
[00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:57.980]   It's just not, it's much more complex in terms of the pronunciation rules than Spanish has.
[00:46:57.980 --> 00:47:01.780]   And so I'll grab a recording from a website called Forvo, forvo.com, where you can grab
[00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:05.660]   a recording of millions of words that native speakers have recorded.
[00:47:05.660 --> 00:47:09.540]   And I'll put that audio recording there on the flashcard.
[00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:11.040]   Then I'll put some example sentences.
[00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:12.580]   So again, here the internet is superior.
[00:47:12.580 --> 00:47:17.340]   I'll grab some example sentences from various dictionaries or various real life sentences.
[00:47:17.340 --> 00:47:19.300]   And I'll put those on my flashcard.
[00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:24.240]   And then if I have some kind of personal connection to it, then I'll try to put a personal connection.
[00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:29.940]   And all of these things are memory techniques that enhance the connection that you have
[00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:30.940]   with something.
[00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:36.400]   And so when I say the word "artazco," I can very clearly see in my head my flashcard that
[00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:42.080]   has a picture of a child, sorry, of a dude stretched out across a desk, staring at a
[00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:48.760]   plate of food, you know, completely overwhelmed as far as how much food that he's eaten.
[00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:54.960]   And this really helps me because now the word is not just a translation which doesn't stick
[00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:56.080]   in my head.
[00:47:56.080 --> 00:47:58.480]   Now it's an emotional experience.
[00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:00.280]   And I do this with all kinds of words.
[00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:02.400]   Well, I do this with all words actually.
[00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:06.160]   And I always find some way to make it visual.
[00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:16.680]   And that's helped me so much to be able to picture my words and to make them mine.
[00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:24.040]   It's just been incredibly valuable to put them into a picture because the pictures imprint
[00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:25.360]   themselves on my head.
[00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:29.520]   And what it also does is I used to do translation.
[00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:31.880]   And every now and then I will put a little bit of English.
[00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:34.880]   But I don't put translations anymore on cards.
[00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:39.560]   I always keep everything exclusively in that language.
[00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:44.400]   So if I need a, what's another word, you know, a word like "berrinche," right, which means
[00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:46.480]   temper tantrum.
[00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:48.240]   So I don't need, it's an obvious thing.
[00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:51.600]   All I need is a picture of a child having an obvious temper tantrum.
[00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:59.680]   And I'll know intuitively this is a berrinche, this is a temper tantrum, not this is a, I
[00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:01.600]   don't need the word, I need the image.
[00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:06.980]   And that helps to learn to really think in another language much faster as well.
[00:49:06.980 --> 00:49:08.160]   And so I'll always find an image.
[00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:19.920]   And if I can't find, if it's an esoteric concept, then I won't, if it's not directly that, then
[00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:21.680]   I just put a number of different pictures.
[00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:27.040]   A number of different pictures that communicate the meaning of it and communicate it to me.
[00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:29.520]   And so you can find out more information on that flashcard system.
[00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:33.880]   I would strongly recommend to you the book Fluent Forever and strongly recommend to you
[00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:35.760]   that flashcard system.
[00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:39.920]   Because so then you start studying and so you learn, you take 20 or 30 new cards a day
[00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:42.880]   and what you do is you start with the new ones until you learn them and then they're
[00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:44.240]   fed back to you.
[00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:48.040]   And Anki has a really easy system where you say when you want it, do I know this, do I
[00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:51.560]   want this in one minute to review it, do I need it in 10 minutes, do I need it in 10
[00:49:51.560 --> 00:49:53.680]   days, do I need it in 10 months.
[00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:57.280]   And so you just naturally build out this card database.
[00:49:57.280 --> 00:50:00.500]   And you review the cards little by little right when you're right at about the point
[00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:05.140]   of forgetting and then you review the cards until it really becomes part of you.
[00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:11.200]   So I use that for learning vocabulary and mastering words is the key.
[00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:12.200]   Anki.
[00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:16.800]   Now another system and the next thing you should do when you're learning vocabulary
[00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:20.560]   is you should use, you should learn the most commonly used words.
[00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:23.720]   So you can begin with a frequency dictionary.
[00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:26.560]   If you're just starting and making cards yourself, start with a frequency dictionary.
[00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:30.360]   Start with a simple phrase book and learn the phrases so that you have some of the useful
[00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:36.800]   phrases of where's the bathroom and good morning and how do I get to the train station,
[00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:38.720]   all that standard tourist stuff.
[00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:43.240]   But then you can start to use a dictionary of usage.
[00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:47.400]   And because it doesn't make any sense for you if you're a new language learner, it doesn't
[00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:55.840]   make any sense for you to learn unusual words like desempañarse and hartasco and berrinche.
[00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:57.160]   It doesn't make sense for that.
[00:50:57.160 --> 00:51:01.840]   You need to learn words like casa and carro and comida are much more useful for you because
[00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:03.760]   they're going to be used a lot more.
[00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:07.000]   So you start with a frequency dictionary and you learn the first couple thousand words
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:10.440]   in their order of frequency of use.
[00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:15.960]   Now the other tool that I love is a tool called link.
[00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:21.840]   And I used link years ago but it wasn't very good and I forgot about it for a long time.
[00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:30.080]   Link is a website, link.com, link.com, but it's a website and it's an app, etc.
[00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:33.900]   And link could in and of itself be your only language learning system.
[00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:37.080]   Link was developed by a polyglot named Steve Kaufman.
[00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:44.200]   And what he developed is a system that allows you to consume content, spoken content, written
[00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:49.440]   content, etc. and to consume it in a way that you can mark the words that you don't know
[00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:50.920]   and mark the words that you do know.
[00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:55.680]   It's a little hard for me to relate verbally, much easier if you just check out the device,
[00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:56.680]   check it out.
[00:51:56.680 --> 00:52:03.960]   But what I do is I use link for learning words with written material that's more at an intermediate
[00:52:03.960 --> 00:52:05.320]   and advanced level.
[00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:10.240]   Now link works for some people to start at a beginner level and I think that's great.
[00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:11.640]   I've not used it for that.
[00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:14.180]   I use it for intermediate and advanced level.
[00:52:14.180 --> 00:52:16.440]   Back to the point of comprehensible input.
[00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:22.080]   One of the challenges of giving yourself comprehensible input is giving yourself something that is
[00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:25.860]   interesting and that has words you don't know but that's not too hard.
[00:52:25.860 --> 00:52:31.560]   So if you sit down to a newspaper and you don't usually read newspapers in English but
[00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:36.760]   all of a sudden I hand you a French newspaper and I say here read this, you have to sit
[00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:39.520]   down and you have to figure out how to look up every single word.
[00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:45.520]   It's too hard, it's too time consuming, it's mind-numbingly boring and it saps your motivation
[00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:47.560]   to continue.
[00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:53.160]   And the process of looking up words is a time-consuming process.
[00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:55.680]   Let's say I'm going to sit down, I'm going to read a novel in Spanish or read a book
[00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:56.680]   in Spanish.
[00:52:56.680 --> 00:52:59.720]   I like to do that but I got to look up still a lot of words and it's time-consuming.
[00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:03.280]   I got to circle the word, look it up, write it there, then reread it, then I got to go
[00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:05.240]   make a flashcard, etc.
[00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:07.480]   What I use is I use link to read.
[00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:10.760]   And so I take a book or you can use any content anywhere.
[00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:14.840]   You can upload newspaper articles, any webpage you're reading, you can load anything into
[00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:15.840]   link.
[00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:20.400]   I like to use it for books and I find it helpful at the intermediate level for me.
[00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:25.960]   So I take my books and what I do is I get the book, either I buy the e-book, I buy an
[00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:30.960]   e-book, buy a Kindle book, take it, strip the DRM, put it into my library and then I
[00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:37.440]   export that into Anki or you can do this with PDFs, any PDF that you have you can export
[00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:38.720]   it into Anki.
[00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:43.040]   And then what Anki will do is Anki will study that and as I'm reading I read in Anki and
[00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:45.640]   it gives me the ability to do a couple of things.
[00:53:45.640 --> 00:53:49.960]   Number one, if I don't understand a word I can just tap the word and it will immediately
[00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:51.560]   show me the definition for it.
[00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:56.120]   I choose the proper definition for the word and it'll immediately add it to a list.
[00:53:56.120 --> 00:54:01.680]   But as I'm reading in Anki over time you develop a system and it'll ignore all the words that
[00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:04.600]   you don't know and it'll just show you the words that you do know.
[00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:10.040]   And then what it allows me to do is to grab the word that I don't know, let's say I'm
[00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:14.820]   reading and I find a word.
[00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:20.880]   Right now I'm reading the Steve Jobs biography by Walter Isaacson in Spanish and so one of
[00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:27.680]   my words from today is the word "asana" which means the feet.
[00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:33.200]   But I can just mark that, I'm reading it in Anki and I can just mark that word, tap my
[00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:39.920]   finger on the word and say "ah, the word asana means feet" like F-E-A-T, not your physical
[00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:44.720]   feet, like a feet of accomplishment or a feet of engineering.
[00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:54.680]   And I can mark this word and now it'll automatically create for me a note that includes the context
[00:54:54.680 --> 00:54:56.080]   in which I read it.
[00:54:56.080 --> 00:55:04.960]   So the context in which I read it was from the Jobs biography.
[00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:10.760]   Así que construyó una compañía en la cual los saltos imaginativos se combinaban con impresionantes
[00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:14.520]   hazañas de ingeniería.
[00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:18.720]   And so I have now the context that comes from the actual book that I was reading and that
[00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:20.320]   goes right on my card.
[00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:23.940]   And I can either study all that vocabulary in Anki and I can do flashcards and reviews
[00:55:23.940 --> 00:55:25.520]   and tests, etc.
[00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:32.440]   Or I can do it in LingQ or I can export automatically flashcards to go over to my Anki decks and
[00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:36.080]   I can study there in my preferred flashcard program.
[00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:40.760]   And so this is the single best way because what it allows you to do is to constantly
[00:55:40.760 --> 00:55:46.480]   consume content that challenges you and to make it so easy for you to look up content
[00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:48.960]   that you can find challenging content.
[00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:56.460]   For years my language ability stagnated because I didn't enjoy the process of reading content
[00:55:56.460 --> 00:55:57.460]   that was hard.
[00:55:57.460 --> 00:56:02.100]   I would get a Spanish novel, for example, and I want to read in Spanish but it's hard.
[00:56:02.100 --> 00:56:06.320]   It's hard when you have to look up 10 or 15 or 20 words on a page.
[00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:08.480]   But yet to advance that's the level you need to be at.
[00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:12.360]   You need to be at the point where you're reading something that you understand the vast majority
[00:56:12.360 --> 00:56:15.280]   of but yet there's still stuff that you don't know.
[00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:19.200]   It's annoying to sit there and in one page of a novel have to look up 10 words and it
[00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:24.360]   turns one page into this time-consuming thing.
[00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:30.280]   But with LingQ I can read and consume advanced level stuff and it's so easy just to find
[00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:34.840]   the definition that I can quickly build those words into my vocabulary.
[00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:40.320]   Now I still use the flashcards because especially I'm trying to move words from my passive vocabulary
[00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:42.280]   to my active vocabulary.
[00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:46.680]   In Spanish right now that's my major focus is in order for me to advance in Spanish I
[00:56:46.680 --> 00:56:52.280]   have to add several thousand words into my active vocabulary and that means not just
[00:56:52.280 --> 00:56:54.840]   words that I would understand in context.
[00:56:54.840 --> 00:57:01.800]   I understand "hacernas de ingeniería" I understand that's feats of engineering in context.
[00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:05.560]   I could probably figure that out but that word's not part of my active vocabulary.
[00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:11.920]   I wouldn't use a word "hacernas" in my daily speech but I want to and so I need the flashcards
[00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:12.920]   still.
[00:57:12.920 --> 00:57:17.240]   But if you're not trying to do that this allows you to just consume much larger levels of
[00:57:17.240 --> 00:57:18.240]   material.
[00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:24.720]   And what happens if you can do that easily it allows you to consume material which makes
[00:57:24.720 --> 00:57:28.920]   most of the grammar in your happen naturally in your head.
[00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:34.000]   So my experience in the English language probably yours as well.
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:41.160]   I can't I can think of one or two things that I've ever gained from a single English grammar
[00:57:41.160 --> 00:57:43.680]   class ever in my life.
[00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:48.240]   About the my one example is I know that if you're going to use a gerund then you make
[00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:51.680]   a possessive pronoun before the gerund.
[00:57:51.680 --> 00:57:57.260]   So the technical rule in English if you're going to say you know I appreciate your coming
[00:57:57.260 --> 00:58:02.420]   over the proper way to say it is I appreciate your coming over.
[00:58:02.420 --> 00:58:07.160]   Coming is a gerund a verb that ends in an ing and so that should be possessive.
[00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:12.280]   I appreciate your coming over to say I appreciate you coming over is incorrect.
[00:58:12.280 --> 00:58:15.720]   That's about the only English grammar rule that I can ever I can come up with off the
[00:58:15.720 --> 00:58:17.120]   top of my head.
[00:58:17.120 --> 00:58:24.320]   But I generally have impeccable English grammar because I have read hundreds of thousands
[00:58:24.320 --> 00:58:27.640]   of pages in English.
[00:58:27.640 --> 00:58:29.980]   And I enjoyed most of that reading.
[00:58:29.980 --> 00:58:37.260]   And so for me LingQ solves that issue of making it possible for me to enjoy reading in a foreign
[00:58:37.260 --> 00:58:43.940]   language which allows me to ignore most of the for me very boring grammar exercises of
[00:58:43.940 --> 00:58:54.480]   sitting down and manually going through these again boring exercises in favor of just letting
[00:58:54.480 --> 00:58:56.100]   my brain work it out.
[00:58:56.100 --> 00:58:59.400]   The human brain is a grammar learning machine.
[00:58:59.400 --> 00:59:03.660]   Children in any language when they speak the language they're exposed to the language they
[00:59:03.660 --> 00:59:05.340]   connect to the language.
[00:59:05.340 --> 00:59:10.340]   Children in any language can naturally learn the grammar of the language without having
[00:59:10.340 --> 00:59:11.800]   to learn the rules.
[00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:17.060]   And so it's one of those kind of secret cheat codes that I don't think I ever studied for
[00:59:17.060 --> 00:59:24.320]   an English test in my life specifically because things just feel right and things feel wrong.
[00:59:24.320 --> 00:59:26.760]   Now you do need parents that speak properly.
[00:59:26.760 --> 00:59:31.460]   That was an advantage that I had that many people don't have is I had literate parents
[00:59:31.460 --> 00:59:33.680]   with proper grammar.
[00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:36.400]   And so we didn't grow up speaking poorly.
[00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:38.920]   We didn't grow up speaking slang.
[00:59:38.920 --> 00:59:47.420]   My parents would be extraordinarily embarrassed if I said me and Tom are going to the lake.
[00:59:47.420 --> 00:59:48.420]   And I do that with my own children.
[00:59:48.420 --> 00:59:52.420]   You just naturally correct those grammar mistakes that your children make and you give them
[00:59:52.420 --> 00:59:55.820]   a huge leg up in life a major advantage.
[00:59:55.820 --> 00:59:57.380]   But you can do the same thing in foreign languages.
[00:59:57.380 --> 01:00:04.560]   You get to the point where you can't explain why something is wrong but you just know that
[01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:06.640]   it feels wrong.
[01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:09.040]   So those are my most useful tools.
[01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:14.160]   Anki for learning vocabulary especially for building vocabulary as part of my active memory
[01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:18.960]   and then LingQ for consuming large amounts of vocabulary.
[01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:20.920]   What else is involved with language?
[01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:22.060]   Well expression.
[01:00:22.060 --> 01:00:25.760]   The ability to express.
[01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:29.200]   Missed a point before I go on to expression.
[01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:31.960]   Back to golden age of language learning.
[01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:36.620]   The most important thing in language learning is to find interesting content that you actually
[01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:39.160]   care about in your target language.
[01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:43.920]   If I were to go back 20 years for me to get target content back when I was in high school
[01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:49.480]   and college and I was interested in languages I couldn't get much of it.
[01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:54.000]   Couldn't get much of it because let's say I want to learn French.
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:57.800]   Well I can get the Pimsleur French CDs and I can get a French book but I always struggled
[01:00:57.800 --> 01:01:01.400]   with the French books because I never learned my pronunciation rules.
[01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:04.560]   But how do I get good French content?
[01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:10.000]   Well there started to be some improvements with DVDs dubbed in French but the breakthrough
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:17.000]   was the ability to access things like French podcasts and I used to drive around and listen
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:22.560]   to the BBC in French and I could just stream it right to my phone while I drove around.
[01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:27.440]   That was game changing and now with YouTube where you can take anything that you're interested
[01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:38.240]   in no matter how obscure and enjoy that content in your target language it's far more interesting.
[01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:41.400]   And so I can take something totally esoteric.
[01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:45.480]   I don't know I enjoy prepper channels on YouTube but I don't really watch them in English I
[01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:52.200]   watch the prepper channels in Portuguese or in French or in Spanish and so it gives me
[01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:57.560]   the natural way to enjoy something that I think is fun and interesting to me but to
[01:01:57.560 --> 01:02:01.000]   do it in a target language and that's the kind of content no one in their right mind
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:07.000]   twenty years ago would ever have created some language DVDs of some random dude doing a
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.160]   tour of his bug out bag.
[01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:13.440]   Makes no sense because there's no market for it but in YouTube I can go and find some guy
[01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:18.440]   who's got 300,000 subscribers to his channel and I can use that as my language study.
[01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:23.000]   And then of course I can import that into Anki if I want to and add it to my vocabulary.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.720]   Anki is a tremendous tool for that.
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:32.880]   So this is where we live in a golden age because I can have access to interesting content all
[01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:33.880]   over the world.
[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:37.680]   So if I'm going to read the newspaper there's no point in reading it in English.
[01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:40.520]   I don't need to read the New York Times or the Washington Post.
[01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:45.400]   I can scan those headlines but if I'm going to read a newspaper article why not read it
[01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:50.400]   from Argentina or why not read it from France.
[01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:54.240]   Why not get a different perspective and get it in an international context.
[01:02:54.240 --> 01:03:02.560]   And so with LingQ and with the modern connectivity I can just grab an article from you know Mexican
[01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:08.960]   newspaper pop that into LingQ read it in Spanish while at the same time adding my vocabulary
[01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:11.440]   words that I'm going to learn for that article.
[01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:17.120]   It's just it's incredible how much easier and how much more fun all these modern tools
[01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:20.120]   make the acquisition of language.
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:22.560]   Now let's go to expression.
[01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:29.480]   All of us are going to be better at listening and understanding than we are at speaking.
[01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:33.400]   And the other big benefits of listening and understanding for example one of the things
[01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:39.320]   that I'm doing right now to level up my Spanish ability is focusing on other accents.
[01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:43.280]   So I have I can understand 100% of Mexicans.
[01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:49.040]   I struggle to understand Cubans and so I'm watching Cuban YouTube channels to try to
[01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:54.360]   train my ear to understand Cuban Spanish because it's just it's difficult for me and if in
[01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:59.920]   my Spanish exam I'm presented with a "Cubano, frecuent, I'm going to be dumb."
[01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:04.160]   I can't do it I can't do a Cuban accent in Spanish, sorry in English but you know it's
[01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:06.800]   Cuban Spanish is really tough for me.
[01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:10.640]   I've many times I've been in Miami and I sit and talk with a Cuban and they'll respond
[01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:14.600]   to me and I look at them and I think I thought I spoke Spanish but now I speak to you and
[01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:16.360]   I don't have a clue what you said.
[01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:20.960]   Well I can easily access that kind of material so the connectivity makes things better.
[01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:22.720]   What about speaking?
[01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:28.440]   First thing I would say is if you're going to improve your ability in a language you've
[01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:30.440]   got to speak it.
[01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:34.760]   And here again we live in a golden age of communication partners.
[01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:38.320]   You might be interested in learning a language but you might not know anybody who speaks
[01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:39.800]   that language.
[01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:45.040]   I, you know, when I have an interest in French, I'm studying French right now, Spanish, French
[01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:50.840]   and Portuguese and so I don't know any French speakers.
[01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:54.560]   There's no one that I have to talk to speak in French with and so there's no natural,
[01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:59.200]   I'm not a part of a natural community of French speakers, I don't, I just don't have it.
[01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:03.680]   But with the internet I have the easy ability to speak to French speakers and there are
[01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:05.000]   tons of websites out there.
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:09.280]   You can do language exchanges free if you want to help someone improve their, you know,
[01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:12.360]   you speak English, you want to do a language swap.
[01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:16.600]   There's a wonderful website called italki.com which connects language teachers and so you
[01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:22.680]   can, with students, and so you can easily book conversation partners and at, you know,
[01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:26.640]   six bucks an hour, seven bucks an hour, book yourself a chance to speak with a native French
[01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:32.000]   speaker, a French tutor and you don't have to go to France, you don't have to go to Quebec,
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:35.040]   you don't have to go there, you can practice in the comfort of your own home.
[01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:38.200]   It's an incredible opportunity to actually speak.
[01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:40.680]   So you have to speak in order to improve a language.
[01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:43.320]   You're always going to be better at listening but you have to speak.
[01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:48.400]   The secret technique that I've done over the years that has made me very skilled in speaking
[01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:54.280]   more fluently than most other students has just been simply learning to translate and
[01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:59.800]   one of the things that I have done for years is if I'm working in a language I force myself
[01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:02.720]   to translate the language in real time.
[01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:06.160]   I would, I started this when I was in high school learning Spanish.
[01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:13.120]   I would be sitting in a church meeting listening to somebody preach and I would try to simultaneously
[01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:16.800]   translate it and of course in the beginning stages, I did it a lot of times because I
[01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:19.760]   was bored when I was in high school and I wasn't really into the content, I just practiced
[01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:26.960]   it for language ability but I would listen and I would try to translate and if you just
[01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:32.720]   do that because you're forced to find workarounds, you can start to be fairly articulate quickly
[01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:36.960]   because your brain gets used to finding the words that you do know of how to express the
[01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:43.920]   concept and what frustrates people is when they don't have the, when they don't have
[01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:50.560]   the skills to, they don't have the advanced vocabulary to express themselves in a language
[01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:56.000]   perfectly, they often get frustrated if they can't find a workaround.
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:05.600]   And so if there's an advanced word that would be the perfect word for the context, it's
[01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:10.380]   nice to know that but you don't need to know that, you can just rephrase it, you can change
[01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:16.520]   and adjust how you're saying and so you can learn this very easily in some languages,
[01:07:16.520 --> 01:07:19.360]   a language like Spanish which has multiple tenses.
[01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:24.400]   So if you wanted to learn to say I will eat, you could of course say comeré, right, I
[01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:29.240]   will eat but it's easier just to learn voy a comer, I'm going to eat, expresses the
[01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:31.760]   same thought and you can get there easier.
[01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:34.800]   And so what I've done over the years is just whenever I'm listening to something that is
[01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:37.080]   not really engaging me, I practice translating it.
[01:07:37.080 --> 01:07:40.200]   So you could do this at work, you're sitting in a meeting at work, kind of boring, try
[01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:46.720]   to figure out how would you translate this into your target language and that skill of
[01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:50.960]   just translating in your head and doing it real time will make you very fast to be able
[01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:56.060]   to express yourself even if you don't have the perfect vocabulary, even if your grammar
[01:07:56.060 --> 01:08:02.120]   is not perfect, you'll still be able to, you won't be fumbling for words like many other
[01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:03.120]   people are.
[01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:06.040]   So that's another technique that I've used over the years.
[01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:10.480]   There are many other things that you could say, just a simple modern technological system
[01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:13.300]   like Google Translate is game changing.
[01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:18.400]   What I do is I keep Google Translate on my phone, losing all my privacy credentials here,
[01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:24.200]   I keep Google Translate on my phone and if there's a word that I'm searching for then
[01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:26.960]   I just, I quickly look it up.
[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:30.120]   So for example, the other day I was trying to tell my children I'm going to tuck you
[01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:31.120]   in, right?
[01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:36.580]   Tuck you in bed is an important, I was speaking up in Spanish and tuck you in bed is an important
[01:08:36.580 --> 01:08:39.040]   thing to convey but I didn't know how to say it.
[01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:45.560]   And so I quickly grabbed it, it's "arroparse", I quickly grabbed it, I grabbed the word and
[01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:50.920]   then what I do is I look it up in Google Translate and then I star it and Google creates a thing
[01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:55.080]   where anything that you star it'll create a list for you and then later I go ahead and
[01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:58.640]   I just pull out my phone and here's all the words that I've looked up throughout the day,
[01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:01.600]   they're all starred, these are words that I need to know because I wanted to know how
[01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:06.760]   do I express to tuck you in and so I learned the word is "arroparse" and so then I grab
[01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:10.840]   it, I pull it over to my flashcard system, I create my flashcard and now I know that
[01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:14.280]   word, I'll never forget it because in my flashcard system I've learned it and now I always know
[01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:19.600]   the word for "arroparse" or the word to tuck you in.
[01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:23.960]   And so these little techniques are so much easier than the way I used to do it with an
[01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:27.880]   index card and a paper dictionary and blah blah blah blah.
[01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:31.760]   So those are some of my most valuable tools.
[01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:38.680]   I have not expressed to you any kind of comprehensive language learning system.
[01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:44.160]   There are many other tips and tricks that you can put into place.
[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:49.300]   What I want to close in by close with is simply expressing to you this.
[01:09:49.300 --> 01:09:54.400]   If you are interested in a language and if you're motivated to learn a language, the
[01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:57.280]   tools are at your fingertips.
[01:09:57.280 --> 01:10:02.240]   Grab yourself some books, grab a link account, you know set up some flashcards, try some
[01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:03.440]   of the things that you need to learn.
[01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:06.420]   Some languages are more complex than others, right?
[01:10:06.420 --> 01:10:12.480]   It's much more difficult for a native English speaker to learn Chinese than it is to learn
[01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:14.200]   Spanish.
[01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:20.200]   But if you just simply because the number of cognates and the amount of familiarity.
[01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:25.320]   But it's actually, I haven't learned Chinese yet, but from my interest in reading about
[01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:30.600]   the language, I think that it's harder for an English speaker to learn excellent Spanish
[01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:32.480]   than it is to learn Chinese.
[01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:37.280]   My understanding, again not being a Chinese speaker, so if I'm wrong, tell me I'm wrong,
[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:44.240]   but a language like Spanish is very easy for an English speaker to learn basic Spanish.
[01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:48.940]   But Spanish is complex because it's a language filled with tenses and all the tenses have
[01:10:48.940 --> 01:10:50.160]   to agree.
[01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:53.760]   All the verbs have to agree with the nouns and the adjectives and everything's changing
[01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:56.520]   in masculine and feminine and singular and plural.
[01:10:56.520 --> 01:11:02.280]   And so to speak it properly with really high level grammar is very difficult.
[01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:06.920]   There are something like a hundred and fourteen ways that you can conjugate any, there's over
[01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:09.920]   a hundred ways you can conjugate any Spanish verb.
[01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:13.600]   And so advanced level Spanish is very challenging.
[01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:19.040]   Whereas Chinese is very hard for an English speaker to learn in the beginning because
[01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:22.320]   you're dealing with a tonal language, you're dealing with a language where there aren't
[01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:29.840]   any, probably any cognates that go back and forth, no words that you would naturally understand.
[01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:36.600]   You know, a cognate again, a word like possible in Spanish, posible, in French, possible,
[01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:37.600]   in English, possible.
[01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:39.960]   So you can look at that and say, "Oh, that's probably possible."
[01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:46.000]   Whereas Chinese, I have no idea what the Chinese word for possible is, but it's not possible.
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:49.880]   But Chinese doesn't have the same complex grammar that Spanish and French have where
[01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:54.440]   all of your genders and your numbers have to match up.
[01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:59.000]   So there are languages that are going to be objectively more difficult to learn, but every
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.480]   language has its thing that makes it a little easier.
[01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:06.200]   Once you get past the tones in Chinese, you're going to have a simpler grammar than you are
[01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:09.400]   with a language like Spanish or French.
[01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:11.980]   But these modern tools make it a lot easier.
[01:12:11.980 --> 01:12:17.140]   So if you have the motivation, if you have the interest, if you have the desire, these
[01:12:17.140 --> 01:12:23.040]   modern tools can make it so that you can learn a language very, very quickly.
[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:24.640]   I'm not a polyglot.
[01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:27.520]   I aspire to be a polyglot, but I'm not a polyglot.
[01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:30.720]   I am a busy father, a busy businessman.
[01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:32.600]   I have limited amounts of time.
[01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:36.000]   My motivation ebbs and flows.
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:37.360]   Sometimes I care, sometimes I don't.
[01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:39.720]   I'll go months and months without studying something.
[01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:43.740]   Sometimes I'll get motivated and really pour on the studies.
[01:12:43.740 --> 01:12:45.840]   But I am convinced of this.
[01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:51.360]   I can take any language in the world, and since I've learned other languages, I know
[01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:53.800]   how I learn to some degree.
[01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:59.280]   I can take any language in the world, and in a few months of study, I can carry on basic
[01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:02.080]   conversations in that language.
[01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:07.160]   And what that makes me feel is it makes me feel incredibly empowered.
[01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:09.840]   Because I know that I could go from...
[01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:10.840]   There's some languages that would be harder, right?
[01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:13.040]   With Chinese, I'd need a few years.
[01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:15.400]   I'll learn Chinese, but it's not yet.
[01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:16.440]   Not yet.
[01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:17.440]   But I'll need a few years of study.
[01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:19.280]   It's going to be challenging.
[01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:24.600]   But I can take almost any language, and especially if it's an easier language, like a romance
[01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:25.600]   language.
[01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:28.000]   Give me a year, and I can be very fluent in it.
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:32.200]   And that's a really empowering feeling, because it makes me feel like I can live anywhere
[01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:33.200]   in the world.
[01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:36.040]   I can move anywhere in the world, and I can connect.
[01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:37.200]   I don't have to always be an outsider.
[01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:39.560]   I can very quickly make progress.
[01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:44.760]   And the learning of it opens up my skills, opens up relationships.
[01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:47.760]   I can't tell you how useful it's been.
[01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:51.800]   I went through all those Pimsleur programs and learned how to say, "Io parlo un poco
[01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:52.800]   d'italiano."
[01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:57.040]   You can ingratiate somebody very quickly and open up a conversation when you can speak
[01:13:57.040 --> 01:13:58.040]   their language.
[01:13:58.040 --> 01:14:02.920]   Even if you only have a few memorized phrases, it makes all the difference in the world.
[01:14:02.920 --> 01:14:08.980]   So I encourage you, if you have an interest in learning a language, clarify your motivation.
[01:14:08.980 --> 01:14:12.000]   Think through a system that you think would work for you.
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.700]   Start using some of these modern tools.
[01:14:13.700 --> 01:14:17.320]   My tool belt is Anki flashcards and LingQ.
[01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:19.040]   I do use other things as well.
[01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:21.760]   There are other forms of content.
[01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:24.400]   There are other classes that can be useful from time to time.
[01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:25.640]   Those will vary with the language.
[01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:26.800]   There are many books that you need.
[01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:30.640]   There's a real value in having some phrase books and grammar books, etc.
[01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:33.260]   You want to invest into your materials.
[01:14:33.260 --> 01:14:36.680]   But you don't have to.
[01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:39.960]   The Foreign Service Institute in the United States has foreign language materials for
[01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:42.980]   all kinds of things, all kinds of languages out there.
[01:14:42.980 --> 01:14:49.520]   And if you want to improve your talent stack, one really good way you could do that is by
[01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:50.880]   learning a language.
[01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:54.320]   In order of most spoken to least spoken, the five or six most commonly spoken languages
[01:14:54.320 --> 01:15:00.700]   in the world, number one English, number two Mandarin Chinese, number three is Hindi, number
[01:15:00.700 --> 01:15:05.820]   four is Spanish, number five is French.
[01:15:05.820 --> 01:15:11.960]   So you should learn the language that you're interested in, but those are some very highly
[01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:12.960]   spoken languages.
[01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:20.160]   And if your career is feeling a little bit stale, you'd like to open up a new market,
[01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:22.680]   this is one of the ways that you can specialize.
[01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:27.560]   You can be the Creole speaking accountant.
[01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:33.800]   And if you are a white American accountant who also speaks fluent Creole, or who also
[01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:39.560]   speaks fluent Spanish, or who also speaks fluent Hindi, or who also speaks Somali, you
[01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:44.560]   can open up a whole new market for yourself and you'll be highly referable.
[01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:50.440]   Now obviously if you're living in Columbus, Ohio and there's a huge Somali population
[01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:56.760]   around you, your knowledge of Somali is not going to make you a better accountant.
[01:15:56.760 --> 01:16:02.480]   But your knowledge of Somali will open up a huge potential base for your accounting
[01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:03.920]   services.
[01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:08.880]   And you don't actually even have to, it's not that the person can't speak English.
[01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:13.760]   You know one of the things I learned over the years by speaking Spanish, and I use French
[01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:17.960]   with Creoles, I don't speak Creole yet, but I've often used it with Haitians, is by being
[01:16:17.960 --> 01:16:20.160]   able to speak a little bit of French.
[01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:28.640]   You know I'm a white American, but I've worked with so many ethnically, with Spanish speakers,
[01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:35.680]   Latinos and Spanish people, and Haitians, that even though they spoke great English
[01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:40.400]   and we would do our work in English, the ability to kind of solve that cultural compatibility
[01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:44.240]   where I could demonstrate, you know I'm a financial advisor, but you know I went to
[01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:49.160]   Haiti on my honeymoon and I can speak a little bit of French and I can understand Creole,
[01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:53.960]   that opens up a community connection in a way that other things don't.
[01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:56.520]   And it opens up a similarity.
[01:16:56.520 --> 01:16:57.520]   And you've got to do that.
[01:16:57.520 --> 01:17:00.800]   If you want good relationships, you've got to learn how to be a little bit culturally
[01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:03.680]   sensitive.
[01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:07.360]   Every culture has their things that make people culturally sensitive, and a little bit of
[01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:16.520]   cultural intelligence, a little bit of cultural wisdom goes a long, long way.
[01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:20.000]   And languages are one way that you can express that cultural intelligence.
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.160]   Hope you've enjoyed the show.
[01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:24.920]   Hope some of these resources are useful for you.
[01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:32.520]   Again, the book Fluent Forever, the application Anki, A-N-K-I, and LingQ, L-I-N-G-Q, those
[01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:34.840]   are the primary resources that I mentioned.
[01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:40.960]   And bon chance.
[01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:41.960]   Great job, mijo.
[01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:42.960]   Nice, mijo.
[01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:43.960]   Good game.
[01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:44.960]   Yeah, congrats.
[01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:45.960]   Thanks.
[01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:46.960]   I'm hungry.
[01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:47.960]   How about tacos in Boyle Heights tonight?
[01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:48.960]   They're the best tacos in LA.
[01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:50.760]   No, the best tacos are in Southgate.
[01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:52.720]   The tacos al vapor there are so good.
[01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:57.760]   If you really want the best tacos, the secret ones are actually at this little place downtown.
[01:17:57.760 --> 01:18:01.000]   Excuse me, I thought my tacos were the best tacos.
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000]   I was about to say that.
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:04.520]   No one can beat your seasoning, honey.
[01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:07.080]   Yeah, mom's tacos are good, but the ones in Boyle Heights are-
[01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:08.520]   The ones in Southgate are still better.
[01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:09.520]   We have food at home.
[01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:11.160]   Tonight, I'm making the tacos.
[01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:15.560]   It's not easy getting your family to agree, but with AT&T Unlimited Year Away, you can
[01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:17.320]   finally agree on something.
[01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:21.200]   Choose a plan to fit the needs of each member of your 323 family.
[01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:27.080]   Get more with AT&T Unlimited Year Away, starting at $35 a month per line for four lines.
[01:18:27.080 --> 01:18:29.880]   AT&T may temporarily slow data speeds if the network is busy.
[01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:32.280]   Buy a price for AT&T Starter Plan with auto pay and paperless bill.
[01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:33.280]   Taxes and fees extra.
[01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:34.840]   Other charges, usage, and restrictions apply.
[01:18:34.840 --> 01:18:37.420]   (upbeat music)
