[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.560]   We started thinking about tears and looking into tears because tears are bodily liquid
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:14.840]   emotional tears that we emit in emotional situations where these are situations where
[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:20.000]   nonverbal communication is critical and key.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:30.240]   And tears are a liquid that is puzzling beyond ocular maintenance.
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:39.040]   And so the most influential text, I think, till this day in emotion research is Darwin's
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.960]   book The Showing of the Emotions in Man and Animals, I think is the full name of the book.
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:51.760]   And an entire chapter, chapter 6, is devoted to tears, an entire chapter of this book.
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:52.760]   Why?
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:53.760]   With no conclusion.
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:54.760]   Why?
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:03.560]   Because the book revolves around describing the functional antecedents of emotional expressions.
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.880]   So for example, showing of the teeth is a sign of aggression, right?
[00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.520]   So animals first bit with their teeth and Darwin argued that through evolution just
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.960]   showing the teeth alone became an aggressive sign because it started from biting.
[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.360]   Or what I find is a beautiful example, and this is work partly done by Adam Anderson
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:30.280]   now at Cornell, is the emotional expression of disgust.
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:36.720]   So disgust, which comes from the Latin disgusia, distaste, right, is spitting something out
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.040]   of your mouth.
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:46.000]   Now what Adam showed is that the musculature patterns of activation and the temporal sequence
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.400]   of activation when you experience moral disgust are the same as when you spit a bitter taste
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.400]   out of your mouth, right?
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.280]   So again, so there's a functional antecedent spitting something out.
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.280]   And through evolution, the argument was that it became an expression of emotion and you
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.320]   express disgust just as if you're spitting something out of your mouth, even though in
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.380]   the case of moral disgust, there's nothing you're spitting out of your mouth.
[00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.520]   So Darwin systematically went through the expressions of emotions and for each one went
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.200]   to their functional antecedent and explained everything very nicely.
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.820]   And then he got stuck with tears, right?
[00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:27.560]   Because tears are an obviously emotional expression and he could not find a functional antecedent.
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.560]   So he ended up saying this is an epic phenomenon, basically, right?
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:37.040]   What all scientists do when they don't have a good explanation, blame it on nature.
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.040]   Right, right.
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:44.280]   So, but he bothered to write this entire chapter on the ocular sort of maintenance function
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.320]   of tears and so on and so forth, but nothing emotional.
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:52.440]   So we thought, well, maybe the function is a chemical signal.
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:03:01.760]   And so with that in mind, we harvested emotional tears, which was also an amusing event on
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:02.760]   its own, right?
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:16.160]   Because we posted messages on all sorts of boards that were seeking experiment participants
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.000]   who cry with ease.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.920]   Now this generated an unfortunate gender bias in our study, right?
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.160]   Because we received about a hundred women volunteers and about one man.
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.620]   And you know, I think this is not a problem only in macho Israel, right?
[00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:31.620]   Probably anywhere in the West.
[00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.000]   This would be, I mean, definitely in America would be the same, I think.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.520]   My guess is that there are probably men out there who cry easily, emotional tears easily.
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.520]   Oh, I'm sure.
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.520]   But they're not going to show up.
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:41.520]   Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:42.520]   It's a cultural thing.
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.400]   It's not, you know, you're not going to come to a lab and say, you know, I cry all the
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.400]   time.
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.280]   It's just not going to happen.
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:54.920]   And then what we did is for each one of these participants, you know, we would ask them,
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.000]   you know, is there a particular film event that you know of that, you know, a scene that
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   makes you cry?
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.160]   And interestingly, in these effective criers, there's always, oh yes, you know, the scene
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.000]   in so-and-so, I always cry profusely from that.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   You know, they have their-
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.200]   Can you give me an example of one of the more commonly named scenes?
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.240]   With these, the movie The Champ.
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:21.320]   The Champ dies, he's a boxer.
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:28.640]   And he dies and literally in the hands of his about eight-year-old son.
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:35.600]   And his son is standing next to his bed and, you know, saying champ, champ.
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.660]   And he dies, right?
[00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:39.660]   It's a winner.
[00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:40.660]   Okay.
[00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:41.660]   Waterfall.
[00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:42.660]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:43.660]   Got it.
[00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:49.000]   So, you know, we're probably the neurobiology lab with most sad movie films on the shelf
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   in the world, right?
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   We have a whole huge collection.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.200]   There is such a thing as tears of joy, by the way.
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.200]   So, no.
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.200]   No?
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.200]   Well, we're going ahead of ourselves.
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.560]   Like I said, we tried to collect them and failed.
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.940]   Even people who think they shed tears of joy and laughter, their eyes water a bit.
[00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.400]   But it's not the same thing.
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:16.560]   In the effective criers we end up screening, so we collect a full ML of tears, a full ML
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.000]   of tears in about 15 minutes.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.080]   So that's pouring, right?
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.800]   And that doesn't happen from laughter.
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.000]   Or we've never seen that.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.800]   We've never seen that happen from laughter.
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.760]   We tried.
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.040]   So we have all these sad films.
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.640]   And by the way, one of the amusing things is when we ultimately published this paper
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:44.760]   in Science, we were forced, in retrospect, to go out and actually buy the films.
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:45.760]   Right?
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:50.440]   I mean, you know, originally we like downloaded them, but you can't because you'd be violating
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.500]   copyright laws, right?
[00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:59.240]   So we had to buy, like purchase all these films that the participants watched.
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:04.240]   So we actually have these in lab, like DVDs, you know, that we actually purchased.
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:09.040]   Nice coverage of potential legal fallout there, Noam.
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.040]   No, we did.
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.040]   We did.
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.040]   I believe you.
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.040]   I believe you.
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.040]   So, yeah.
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:19.160]   And, well, we can touch on that later.
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:29.560]   But so most of these volunteers who come saying they can cry with ease actually don't meet
[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.200]   the bill.
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:36.320]   And so out of the about hundred, at least, more women that we screened, we ended up with
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:44.040]   about six who could really come to lab week after week in poor tears.
[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.540]   There's a name for this in psychiatry.
[00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:48.720]   They call it a narrative distancing.
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:54.480]   Some people, when they watch a film where someone's getting hit, they flinch quite a
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:55.480]   lot.
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:56.880]   It's almost as if they're experiencing it.
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.400]   But it works in the opposite direction, too.
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:03.320]   I know someone like this, where if they watch a film that someone's experiencing something
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.760]   even mildly positive, their mood elevates.
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:09.100]   So they can quickly bridge.
[00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:11.240]   And it's not always adaptive, as you can imagine.
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.080]   So there's a lack of narrative distancing.
[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.080]   Right.
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.080]   Yeah.
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.760]   Well, one issue you can bring up with this entire line of studies in our lab is I don't
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:21.680]   know if there's something very unique about the donors, right?
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.160]   I mean, we're assuming these are tears.
[00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.400]   No, this is pretty common.
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:33.320]   I think that the numbers I saw out there, about 5% to 8% of people got about 600.
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:44.880]   So we collected tears, and we exposed participants to these tears.
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.720]   And we found a few things.
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:49.260]   First of all, the tears are completely odorless.
[00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.840]   You cannot detect them at all.
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:54.960]   Completely odorless.
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:08:05.400]   And yet, when you sniff them, you have a pronounced reduction in testosterone within about 20
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.880]   minutes, half an hour.
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:09.560]   This is men and women smelling women's tears.
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:10.560]   Just men.
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.280]   Men smelling women's tears, but not perceiving any odor.
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:14.280]   Nothing.
[00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:15.640]   Just sniffing them.
[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:21.680]   And you have about a 14% drop in free testosterone.
[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:22.680]   Free.
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:26.080]   OK, so this is testosterone that's already been liberated from the testes.
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:27.080]   Free testosterone.
[00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:32.560]   We've done a few hormones that's either bound or unbound-- is unbound, excuse me-- from
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:34.320]   sex hormone binding globulin, et cetera.
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.480]   And it's the active form.
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:41.120]   So it's subject to very short timescale changes.
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.120]   Yeah.
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:47.480]   And this is-- people who study testosterone, which is not me, but they tell me this is
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:49.400]   a really strong effect.
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:53.320]   It's hard to even pharmacologically get an effect like that that fast.
[00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:54.320]   No one in pharmacology.
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.320]   Yeah.
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.560]   Years ago, I spent time studying endocrine effects of this sort.
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:00.640]   And that's a tremendously sized effect.
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:09.800]   So here, I'll point out in passing that one of the concerns we had because of the effort
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:14.800]   to run this study is that nobody would ever try to replicate it.
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:22.320]   And to our joy, about two years later, an independent group from South Korea, OHL, who
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:29.840]   I don't know at all, replicated the testosterone effect to a T. I mean, like, same numbers.
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:34.480]   So it lowers testosterone.
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:47.800]   And we then also looked, using MR, at the effect on brain activity and saw a pronounced
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:54.560]   effect on activity, a dampening, a lowering of activity under an arousing state, a lowering
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:10:01.480]   of activity both in the hypothalamus and in the fusiform gyrus, for whatever reason I
[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:02.480]   don't know.
[00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:03.480]   Face recognition area.
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:05.800]   It's other things, yes.
[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:10.240]   And we don't know why, but pronounced.
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:18.160]   And currently, Shania Groen in our lab is replicating this again, and this time with
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.400]   a stronger behavioral component.
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:28.520]   And I can share with you unpublished data now under review that's, as you would expect,
[00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:34.600]   given the effect on testosterone perhaps, sniffing tears lowers aggression in men.
[00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:39.040]   Using again the TAP, the same experiment used by Yvonne in the hexadecanol experiment.
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:45.880]   The TAP, I'm going to think of that as the SATIS, the titration, the SATIS titration
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:46.880]   experiment.
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:47.880]   The Tyler Aggression Paradigm.
[00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:55.160]   Not unlike the Milgram experiments of the 1950s, which post, this was looking at sort
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:11:01.720]   of post-Holocaust behavior, people basically in American laboratories thinking they were
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:04.800]   torturing other people simply because they were told to.
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:07.960]   And a lot of people did that, even though most people would report that they would never
[00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:08.960]   torture somebody else.
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:11.720]   Yeah, no, humans are not a wonderful species.
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:16.960]   Or as you could say, I think it was the great Carl Jung that said, we have all things inside
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:23.920]   of us, but the goal is not to experience them all, certainly.
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:31.080]   It's an incredible study and it points again to the power of these chemosensory systems
[00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.080]   and pathways.
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:35.320]   And obviously, there's so much here.
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:40.800]   I don't know if you want me to tell about this or not, and I guess you can edit it out.
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:46.840]   This is just sharing stories about the politics of science.
[00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:53.840]   So whereas the effect on testosterone was replicated by an independent group.
[00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:58.480]   In the original study in science, it had three components.
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:02.360]   One was the effect on testosterone, which was robust.
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:06.320]   The second, which was brain activity, which was robust.
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:11.180]   And there was a significant but weaker effect on behavior.
[00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:13.720]   And I don't think we studied the right behavior in retrospect.
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:21.240]   What we looked at then was ratings of arousal associated with pictures.
[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:28.640]   And there was an effect, it was significant, but it was not what carried the story.
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:38.480]   Now there is a lab in Holland of a guy by the name of, I'm probably mispronouncing this,
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:42.240]   but I think it's Wingerhoets.
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:43.240]   For the non-Dutch.
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.240]   Yeah.
[00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:46.800]   Dutch names are always a little bit of a challenge.
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:51.280]   And I shouldn't say that, being an Israeli, I shouldn't go too much on that line.
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:58.640]   But that lab really didn't like our original tear story.
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:06.960]   And the reason they didn't like it is because they've built a career on this notion, including
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:12.440]   a book with this title, that emotional tears are uniquely human.
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:17.240]   Now, here I should, well, I should share.
[00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:25.720]   So one of the things we really liked about the tear result is that partially before we
[00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:29.600]   did our work, but more afterwards, and we like that because usually things, so usually
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:33.000]   in our chemo signaling work, like what I told you before about the Bruce effect, we look
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.600]   at what happens in rodents and we see if the same thing is happening in humans.
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:42.680]   This was a rare case where after we did this work, more or less identical effects were
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:44.400]   discovered in rodents.
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:52.000]   So a paper published in Nature two years later found that mouse tears, mouse pup tears, lower
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.680]   aggression in male adult mice towards them.
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:58.600]   In a smell dependent way.
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:13:59.600]   Yeah.
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:00.600]   Yeah.
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:05.200]   So and they also actually found the actual component in tears that, so the tear pheromone
[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:06.600]   that lowers aggression.
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:07.600]   Right.
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:12.000]   So, you know, this has us thinking of tears as you can think of tears as like a chemical
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.800]   blanket in a way that you're covering yourself up again with, you know, to protect against
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:20.560]   aggression, right?
[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:25.120]   And so our finding, you know, which to me, I mean, this is consistent with how I think
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:26.120]   about behavior in general.
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:30.960]   I, you know, I don't think, you know, beyond language, there are very few things, definitely
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:33.440]   sensory things that are uniquely human.
[00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:36.320]   You know, I'd be hard pressed.
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:41.480]   But so, you know, our finding went against their story, right?
[00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:45.340]   Because, you know, here we're saying no, you know, tears are this chemo signaling mechanism
[00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:46.960]   like all animals.
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:51.840]   And by the way, you know, just after this entire debate, about six months ago, there
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:56.800]   was a paper in Current Biology that dogs emit emotional tears.
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:02.040]   And it was the dogs emit emotional tears when they reunite with their owners.
[00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:06.640]   And you were talking before about oxytocin.
[00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:13.520]   So I think what they showed there is that not only that, but that the view of seeing
[00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:17.880]   the tears in the dog influences oxytocin in the humans.
[00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:20.120]   I hope I'm getting this right.
[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.880]   No, I absolutely believe this.
[00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:26.240]   I mean, from the time I brought Costello home at eight weeks old.
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:27.240]   Costello is your dog.
[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:28.240]   He's my dog.
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:29.240]   Unfortunately, he passed away.
[00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:30.240]   We haven't had him in a long time.
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:36.300]   But from the time I can recall crying, listen, I've certainly cried before many times in
[00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:39.960]   my life, many, many times.
[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:44.000]   The only time I ever recall crying to the point where I wasn't sure that I could keep
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.540]   producing tears, but somehow it is when I had to put him down, right?
[00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:50.880]   Is this like, you know, and if I talk about too long now, I'll start crying.
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:52.360]   You know, it's one of those things.
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:55.000]   I think it's a healthy emotional state.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.160]   But I recall when he was a puppy, thinking this oxytocin thing must be real.
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:05.880]   Because I can recall being in faculty meetings, which, you know, fairly stated are not always
[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:07.720]   that interesting, but they can be pretty interesting.
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:12.680]   And someone presenting data and my mind thinking, I hope Costello is okay.
[00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:13.680]   What's he doing down in my office?
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:15.360]   This is when he was very little.
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:21.520]   And also not needing to eat, not being able to focus on anything else except my attachment
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:24.080]   to him for about the first two or three weeks that I had him.
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:25.080]   Then it was easy.
[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:26.520]   Then I could focus off on other things.
[00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:32.840]   And I think that dogs, perhaps through oxytocin, hijack the circuitry that's intended for child
[00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:33.840]   rearing.
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:34.840]   I really do.
[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:38.160]   Otherwise, why would people be so ridiculously attached to their dogs?
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:41.800]   Hence all the posts of everyone thinks their dog is the cutest dog, the same way everyone
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:43.800]   thinks their children are the cutest children.
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:50.160]   Costello, by the way, was a very handsome bulldog.
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:56.480]   So again, so even, you know, to put another nail in that story of tears are uniquely human.
[00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:57.600]   So they're not.
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:01.360]   Dogs shed emotional tears.
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:04.800]   And so that group really didn't like this.
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:12.000]   And they went ahead and tried to replicate, and to your listeners I'm showing double quotations
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:23.120]   on the replicate, only the behavioral part, the ratings of arousal of women and failed
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:25.240]   to replicate that.
[00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:30.880]   Now, this was just sharing on how science works and doesn't work in my notion in this
[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:32.120]   case.
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:43.240]   So at the time, after they got this accepted in some journal, not a field journal, a journal
[00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:52.280]   of memory of something, they contacted me for a response.
[00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:57.440]   And I wrote to the office and I said, look, you know, this is very odd to me, why don't
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:01.920]   you come, why don't we replicate this again together and see if it doesn't work.
[00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:06.760]   If it doesn't work, I'll publish it with you that it doesn't work, but you know.
[00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:10.240]   And so I said, why don't you send over a graduate student or the lead author and we'll do it
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:16.120]   here and we'll show them how it's done because they did it very wrongly in the paper.
[00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:20.160]   And so they replied that no, they don't have money to send over a graduate student to do
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:21.160]   it.
[00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:25.800]   So they replied saying, okay, I'll fund the graduate student coming over and I'll fund
[00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:30.240]   the entire study and their stay and so on and so forth and let's do this together.
[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:34.980]   And they replied, no, they're not willing to do that, which I don't think is the way
[00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:37.000]   things should work.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:44.080]   And they published this sort of failed behavioral effect in that paper.
[00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:48.320]   So I'm just sharing this, you know, that it's not only, there was that successful replication
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:52.040]   with the effect on testosterone, but there was supposedly this failed replication on
[00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:55.560]   the effect in behavior.
[00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:59.960]   And then I published a rebuttal on that, which I don't know if I should have done, but I
[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:00.960]   did.
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:01.960]   Well, I think it's interesting.
[00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:05.720]   I mean, I think provided studies are done correctly.
[00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:10.560]   I mean, the positive result almost always trumps the negative result.
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:12.120]   And yet I think replication is key.
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:16.760]   The problem, as you pointed out, is that replication is rarely pure replication of the exact study.
[00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:20.240]   This one is not even remotely, but I published the detail.
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:23.880]   So actually they hid something in their data that did partially work.
[00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:28.040]   So I asked for their data and I reanalyzed it and that's what I published in the rebuttal.
[00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:30.760]   But you know, this is just sharing on how science works.
[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:31.760]   I took advice.
[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:37.320]   So it's not that I'm friends with him, but at that time I was communicating a bit because
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:43.880]   we were on some board with Daniel Kahneman, who's Nobel laureate.
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:48.860]   And so I asked him, how should I deal with this?
[00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:50.180]   You know, give me some advice here.
[00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:55.920]   I was really, you know, it was emotionally not fun to be in that position.
[00:19:55.920 --> 00:20:01.160]   And he said, "Don't ever publish a rebuttal.
[00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:02.160]   Don't do anything."
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:04.280]   And I was, you know, how can I?
[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:05.280]   You know, I have to do something.
[00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:06.400]   He said, "No, don't.
[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:10.080]   Because once you do that, then, you know, people don't go into the details.
[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:11.640]   They won't read the details of your rebuttal.
[00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:15.000]   They'll be like, well, there's a group that says this and there's a group that says that.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   So it's unclear."
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.280]   Well, and yeah, I mean, I appreciate that you're bringing it up today.
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:24.040]   And I do appreciate that you published the rebuttal and that you offered in a very magnanimous
[00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:25.360]   way to do a collaboration.
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:27.160]   That's what he then said.
[00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:34.000]   So Kahneman's advice after that was that, well, if you insist, then just publish, write
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.080]   a response that you offered them to come do it together.
[00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:47.400]   They refused and there's nothing you can do about that.
