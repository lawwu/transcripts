[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.040]   Gloria writes in to ask this, "Pastor John, James 516 confuses me. It says, 'Confess
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.080]   your sins to one another.' Is it saying that we have to confess our sins like
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.640]   Catholics do to a priest? Can you please explain what this means?" Right. No, I don't
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:27.360]   think the tradition of the Roman Catholic Church to, number one, elevate a
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:35.800]   priest to the position of a uniquely suitable confessor has any roots in this
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.280]   text. I don't think this text is a place you go to get that. In fact, I don't think
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.200]   there is a place in the New Testament where you can go to get that. So what this
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:50.960]   text does is to call us to something far more reciprocal than that, even when the
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.680]   elders are involved. It might be helpful just to read it, just so people have the
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:00.960]   context. "Is anyone among you sick?" This is James 514. "Let him call for the elders of
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.960]   the church. Let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.720]   the Lord, and the prayer of faith will save the one who is sick, and the Lord
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.440]   will raise him up, and if he's committed sins, he'll be forgiven. Therefore,
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:22.560]   confess your sins to one another, and pray for one another that you may be
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.400]   healed. The prayer of a righteous person has great power in its working." So the
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.960]   first thing we see there is a plurality of elders, not a priest. "Call for the
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.000]   elders." If you think it's time to have the leaders of the church
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.560]   involved, the New Testament always thinks in terms of a plurality of elders. There
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.400]   isn't any church in the New Testament we know of that only had one. They never
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.680]   used the word "priest" for the pastors of the New Testament Church. So go ahead,
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.240]   call two, three, four, whatever your church provides. Call the elders and have them
[00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.800]   pray for you. But here's the interesting thing. After James describes that event
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.480]   with the elders and their prayer of faith and what will happen there, he
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.800]   seems to draw out in verse 16 an inference, and he moves from that
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.400]   specific situation, it seems, to something more general and more reciprocal. He says,
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:21.560]   "Therefore, confess your sins to one another." So there's something, some
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.160]   principal thing that was going on there about the way your sins emerged in that
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.480]   situation, and your sins got forgiven as well as your body got healed. Now here's
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.840]   a principle I'm drawing out. "Confess your sins to one another and pray for one
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.760]   another that that would be happening more and more." So I don't see this text
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:48.240]   leading toward a narrowing down of a saint and a priestly confessor. I see
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:54.400]   this text broadening out to the body of Christ, saying, "Confess your sins to one
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.520]   another that you may be healed." And so I ask the question, "Now why would that
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.560]   be? Why would mutual confessionâ€”it's like in a small group, or say you have a
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.920]   buddy that you meet for breakfast with, and you know you're struggling with some
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:16.200]   issue of anger or pride or lust, and you just lay your heart out for him in
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:24.240]   how you struggled yesterday. Why is that a healing thing?" And I think there's
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.920]   a beautiful example of it in the Psalms, and I know there's a beautiful example
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.640]   of it in my experience. David said in Psalm 32, "Blessed is the man whose
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.360]   transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered. Blessed is the man against whom
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:44.360]   the Lord counts no iniquity, in whose heart there's no conceit." And then he
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:52.840]   says, "When I kept silent, my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long." So
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.520]   that's the condition of the non-confessing heart, the heart that's
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.360]   all bottled up, never tells anybody what it's dealing with, just hides and hides
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.060]   and hides away from people. "For day and night your hand was heavy on me, my
[00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.680]   strength was dried up as the heat of summer." And then he says, "I acknowledged
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:16.760]   my sin to you, I did not cover my iniquity, I said I will confess my
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.120]   transgressions to the Lord, and you forgave the iniquity." So there's a
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:28.000]   sequence here of sinning, bottling up and having your bones dry up inside, then
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.560]   letting it out and going public with it, in this context to God, but in the
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.720]   principle behind it probably not just to God but to the person you sinned against
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:45.760]   or to others who could help you bear this. So one another confessing is the
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:51.240]   principle here, and there's good warrant for why it is a healing thing. And
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:57.080]   I would just maybe very practically say, you don't have to do that to the
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.080]   whole church. One principle would be confess a sin against someone to that
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.040]   person, and that may be the place where it can simply end. If it's something that
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.160]   you're dealing with more generally, you can share it with your small group or a
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:14.320]   confidant that you have. I think everybody should have, like Jesus, a
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:19.000]   beloved disciple and a Peter, James, and John and a 12 and a 70. In other words,
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.760]   there are concentric circles that we live in of intimacy, and some things
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.200]   we're going to share with the beloved disciple, and some things Peter, James, and
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.800]   John, and some things the 12 and so on, and God will make it
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:39.520]   plain. There are times we confess openly to everyone, and there are times we are
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:46.680]   very careful lest we hurt anyone by our confession to be more discreet and
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:54.320]   confess to those who are very, very close to us. So no, my answer is no. This text
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:06:00.840]   doesn't give warrant that I can see to the practice of treating a pastor or a
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:06.380]   priest as uniquely qualified to be the place where we go to share our
[00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:10.360]   confessions. Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for listening to this podcast. Email your
