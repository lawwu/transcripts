[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   Let's get started with our deep dive.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.100]   So here's what I want to talk about today.
[00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.760]   Tiredness.
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.300]   A lot of knowledge workers I hear from are telling me that they are tired
[00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:18.200]   and exhausted all of the time, not the sort of lack of sleep tiredness
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.860]   where you know where that's from, but more of a psychological exhaustion,
[00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.300]   the sort of I have a hard time continuing to work on hard things
[00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.760]   after we get to two o'clock in the afternoon.
[00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.060]   So what I want to do here is argue that the explanation for this
[00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.220]   endemic tiredness is not what you think.
[00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.560]   And when we realize what's really causing this tiredness,
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.360]   some unexpected but targeted solutions become possible.
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.420]   And I have a couple that I want to give you at the end of this deep dive.
[00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.020]   All right, so let's get started with the most common answer.
[00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.860]   If you ask people, why are you tired all the time?
[00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.120]   The most common answer you're going to hear from knowledge workers
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.460]   is work volume.
[00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.860]   We have too much work.
[00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.920]   The metaphor we want to give here is we have a battery.
[00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:07.760]   That's our energy.
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:13.120]   Every unit of work, every 10 minutes of work drains a little bit from the battery.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.360]   So if you have too many units of work that you have to do in a given day,
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.760]   you drain the battery down to empty, and that's what caused the state of exhaustion.
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.220]   I think this is the common mental model that most knowledge workers have.
[00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.420]   I think, however, the real answer is more complicated than that.
[00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.060]   There's two pieces of evidence that tells us that this draining battery model
[00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.860]   is not quite like we think it is.
[00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.720]   The first piece of evidence is we can find numerous case studies
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.920]   of knowledge workers who produce a large quantity of work.
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.260]   So the total units of knowledge work that they're doing is very, very high.
[00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.760]   And yet they don't report being exhausted.
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.660]   They don't report being tired.
[00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.160]   Let me give you an extreme example of this.
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.420]   I'm going to actually bring up a picture of her on the screen here
[00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.460]   for people who are watching instead of just listening.
[00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.020]   Up on the screen, I have Maria Popova, the blogger, writer, newsletter writer.
[00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.720]   Her site used to be called Brain Pickings.
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.460]   Now it's called Marginalia.
[00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:14.020]   She does reviews of books, reviews and commentary on books.
[00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.120]   She works a lot.
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.720]   So I found a profile of her from about 10 years ago
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.660]   where they cataloged her typical workday.
[00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:28.460]   But her typical workday is three essays or posts per day.
[00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:34.560]   She also used to have a regimen of 50 tweets per day all scheduled out.
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.320]   So I can just tell you from a writing point of view,
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.860]   that is a large amount of knowledge work,
[00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.620]   especially since the articles and posts that she puts on her site
[00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.960]   are based off of her reading entire complicated books,
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.720]   novels, poetry, nonfiction books, memoirs.
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.120]   So she's reading roughly a book a day.
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.460]   She's posting three times a day plus at least for a while
[00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.220]   was doing 50 tweets a day.
[00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.020]   So she works a lot.
[00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.060]   But as the quote shows up here on the screen,
[00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.220]   she does not describe herself as exhausted or tired.
[00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.460]   I'm reading now something she said.
[00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.520]   I'm a believer in pacing, creating a rhythm
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.620]   where you do very intense focus work for an extended period,
[00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.420]   but then you take a short break and then cycle back.
[00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.480]   I think ours is a culture where we wear our ability to get by
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.480]   on very little sleep as a kind of badge of honor
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.880]   that speaks to work ethic or toughness or whatever,
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.960]   but it really is just a total profound failure of priorities
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.580]   and self-respect.
[00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:26.880]   She does not buy this idea
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.220]   that you should be exhausted all the time.
[00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.460]   Here's another example.
[00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.720]   I'll bring him up on the screen.
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.520]   The famous memoirist, not memoirist,
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.680]   nonfiction biographer, Robert Caro,
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.880]   who among other things has written the,
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.220]   or is still writing the acclaimed multi-volume biography
[00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.360]   of Lyndon Johnson.
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.960]   Robert Caro also writes all the time.
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.660]   I'm reading here on the screen a quote.
[00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:53.920]   In his New York City office
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.680]   where everything has this particular place,
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.960]   Caro works long hours, seven days a week,
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.620]   pouring through interview transcripts
[00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:02.760]   and primary source notes,
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.060]   working slowly and deliberately on books he publishes
[00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.680]   on average once every 10 years.
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.820]   He works constantly, huge volume of work.
[00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.780]   So just add up the units of work.
[00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.020]   There's a lot, yet he's not exhausted.
[00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.520]   And in the secondary quote here,
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.020]   I have him talking about many days
[00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:20.580]   where he jumps out of bed happy.
[00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:21.560]   I'm really getting into it.
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.880]   I tend to get up earlier and earlier
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.880]   just because I'm excited to get to work.
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.480]   He's not exhausted.
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.020]   All right, so volume of work.
[00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.520]   This does not seem to be the full explanation
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.960]   for why we are tired.
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.320]   We also can look at some survey data on this as well.
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.920]   I'm bringing here on the screen another article here.
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.980]   This is from Work Life.
[00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.320]   It's summarizing a study.
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.620]   And the headline tells you everything you need to know
[00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.120]   about the study that they're summarizing.
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.520]   Nearly half of workers say they work four hours a day.
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.560]   Right?
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.360]   So we have examples of people who work a huge amount.
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.860]   They accomplish a huge amount of work, but are not tired.
[00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.060]   We also have evidence that when we work at,
[00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.320]   when we look at how many hours most knowledge workers
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:06.680]   are actually working,
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.680]   it's not as large as you might suspect.
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.060]   So there's something else going on here
[00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.260]   than just the total units of work is draining our batteries.
[00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.200]   So what is really going on here?
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.100]   Here's my answer.
[00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.760]   It's not the volume of work that matters.
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:23.960]   It's how we schedule it.
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.900]   So let's go back.
[00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:26.720]   What was different?
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.960]   Our first piece of evidence was Popova and Karo
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:29.960]   were not exhausted.
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.320]   Why did their work schedule probably hit you
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.520]   as very different than your work schedule?
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.160]   It's because the way they talked about
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.660]   how their work was scheduled.
[00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:42.260]   Popova talked about, "I work for a long period of time,
[00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.900]   "extended periods of time on something hard."
[00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.200]   Karo sits in his office
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.920]   and he will sit there with interview transcripts
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.420]   hours and hours at a time, just reading.
[00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:53.420]   The documentary that came out last year about Robert Karo
[00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.400]   had the title "Turn Every Page"
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.960]   because that's his advice on how to write
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.520]   a good nonfiction biography.
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.360]   Read every single page in the archives
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.160]   until you're completely immersed in it.
[00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.560]   So what we see in the scheduling of their work
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.720]   is a sequentialness,
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.000]   long stretches on one hard thing at a time.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.500]   The total amount of work they do is large,
[00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.920]   but the total amount of times that they are shifting
[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.020]   from one thing to another is small.
[00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:26.020]   This is very different than how most knowledge workers
[00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:28.960]   are approaching their own work.
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.520]   The typical knowledge worker
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.860]   is constantly jumping back and forth
[00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:36.520]   between different targets of their attention.
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.420]   Now there's a lot of reasons for this.
[00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:42.720]   One is the diversity of things we have on our plate
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.600]   at any one time is very large.
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.200]   So we often have many different tasks and obligations
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.320]   that we're shuffling.
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.920]   Each of these different tasks, obligations, or projects
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.400]   brings with it its own demands of overhead.
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.100]   Emails that have to be sent to keep coordinating it
[00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.500]   or moving it forward, calls that have to be made,
[00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:00.960]   meetings that have to be jumped on,
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.360]   small tasks that have to be accomplished.
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.720]   So if we have a lot of different types of things
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:10.660]   on our plate, we get a lot of these small overhead tasks
[00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:12.060]   crowding out our schedule.
[00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:13.720]   So we have to jump back and forth between them,
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.260]   an email about this project, a meeting about this project,
[00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:17.960]   on the three emails about that project,
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:19.400]   an email about this thing over here
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:20.500]   before we're back on a meeting,
[00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:23.060]   and then we have to file this paper over here.
[00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:26.060]   That requires a lot of shifting back and forth of attention.
[00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:28.720]   The other thing that happens, of course,
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.660]   is just in general, the way that we coordinate
[00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:32.500]   or collaborate in the Knowledge Work environment
[00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:35.660]   is that we use ad hoc on-demand messaging.
[00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:37.320]   We figure things out on the fly
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:40.060]   with these ongoing back and forth digital conversations
[00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:41.500]   that are unfolding in an inbox
[00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:45.020]   or unfolding in a Slack chat channel.
[00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:47.460]   This too requires us to keep switching our attention
[00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:50.460]   from whatever we're working on to these channels
[00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:52.700]   so that we can keep those conversations going,
[00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:53.860]   and then back to what we're working on,
[00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:56.560]   and then back to the channel to knock another message back
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:57.600]   or to reply to another chat,
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.900]   then back to what we're working on.
[00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:03.140]   So we create an environment in which our attention
[00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:04.740]   is constantly shifting back and forth
[00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:06.460]   between different things.
[00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:10.500]   Very different than what we observe with Papava or Caro.
[00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:12.340]   Papava will sit down and read for four hours.
[00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:14.400]   All she's doing is reading that book.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.660]   Caro will sit down and work on a chapter for five hours.
[00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:19.300]   All he's doing is working on that chapter.
[00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:21.960]   They're doing one thing at a time for long periods of time.
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:23.760]   We're switching back and forth frantically
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:26.160]   between many different things.
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.460]   So is this a problem?
[00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:29.300]   It is.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.400]   Let me load up on the screen here
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:36.560]   a important research article from 2009.
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:39.760]   This is Sophie Leroy's paper titled,
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:42.600]   "Why is it so hard to do my work?
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.260]   "The challenge of attention residue
[00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:48.640]   "when switching between work tasks."
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:53.640]   I'm just gonna read you something here from the abstract.
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.200]   So here we go.
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:58.260]   "Results indicate it is difficult for people
[00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:02.000]   "to transition their attention away from an unfinished task
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.400]   "and their subsequent task performance suffers.
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.940]   "Being able to finish one task before switching to another
[00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:12.400]   "is however not enough to enable effective task transition.
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.940]   "Time pressure while finishing a prior task
[00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:16.560]   "is needed to disengage from the first task
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:17.800]   "and thus move to the next task
[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.500]   "and contributes to highest performance on the next task."
[00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:21.960]   So if you look closer at this paper,
[00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:24.140]   she has these two results,
[00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:25.820]   which is it takes a lot of time
[00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:30.120]   to switch fully your attention.
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:33.100]   So when you switch from one task to another,
[00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:34.980]   there is something called attention residue
[00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:36.340]   that is left behind,
[00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:39.300]   which lowers your cognitive capacity,
[00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:42.040]   generates fatigue until it clears out.
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:44.500]   You have a conflict of things that you're focusing on.
[00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:45.700]   She says, "Even if you finish,"
[00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:46.840]   this is her second point,
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.100]   "Even if you finish a task,
[00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:50.800]   "it takes a while before that clears out of your mind."
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.640]   Now she says, "Time pressure can help here.
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.200]   "So if you have a deadline,
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:58.080]   "I have to submit this thing before the post office close."
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.240]   And you have a clear deadline
[00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:01.500]   and you submit something right before the deadline,
[00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:02.980]   it's a little bit easier to clear out
[00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:03.880]   that attention residue.
[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:05.660]   That's what she meant about the time pressure.
[00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:06.940]   But the big picture thing here
[00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.300]   is that your brain loads up lots of information
[00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:10.500]   about whatever you're working on,
[00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:13.340]   and it's not a cheap or quick operation
[00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:16.080]   to change that to a different target.
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:21.820]   This is why the typical knowledge worker approach
[00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:24.860]   of frantic switching back and forth of your attention
[00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:26.340]   is exhausting us.
[00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:28.080]   It's why you're tired by 2 p.m.
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.880]   and say, "I can no longer do anything hard."
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.440]   It's the switching back and forth
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.500]   is making your brain miserable.
[00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:36.740]   It just can't do it.
[00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:38.140]   You're constantly in a state
[00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:39.740]   where your brain has one context
[00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:40.980]   and you're working on another context,
[00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:42.260]   and before it can load that context,
[00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.500]   you switch it back to that context.
[00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:46.160]   It's just really difficult.
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:50.420]   It's like if you're a professional runner for your job
[00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:52.020]   and you didn't realize
[00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:54.520]   that you've been wearing a backpack full of bricks.
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:59.880]   It makes your job unnecessarily more difficult.
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:03.180]   So it's not the volume of work that's the problem.
[00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:05.320]   Maria and Robert do a huge volume of work,
[00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:06.660]   but they're not context shifting.
[00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:07.940]   They're barely context shifting.
[00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:11.380]   So the mental experience is much more sustainable
[00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:12.980]   than those of us who maybe are only getting,
[00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:15.340]   like that study said, four real hours of work in,
[00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:18.380]   but that four hours is completely fragmented
[00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:20.380]   with frenetic back and forth context switching.
[00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:21.700]   So it feels like you just finished
[00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:24.740]   the proverbial knowledge work equivalent of a marathon
[00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:26.500]   with all those bricks on your back.
[00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:29.620]   So it is very self-imposed difficulties
[00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:30.860]   that we're putting ourselves in.
[00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:33.300]   This is why I think we're tired.
[00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:35.740]   We switch our attention back and forth too much.
[00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:37.740]   All right, so that's good news, bad news.
[00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:42.120]   The bad news is, shoot, it's hard to just stop doing that.
[00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:44.600]   My bosses is emailing me.
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:45.940]   I have a lot of work on my plate,
[00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:47.180]   but the good news is at least we know
[00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:48.840]   what we're trying to accomplish.
[00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:51.900]   We don't have to argue, give me less work.
[00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:53.120]   We instead have to figure out
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:56.300]   how do I make my work more sequential?
[00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:58.540]   So I wanna give you one general piece of advice here
[00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:00.980]   and then one brand new specific piece of advice,
[00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:03.320]   a strategy that I think a lot of people
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:04.380]   could get a lot of help out of.
[00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:06.640]   It's something I haven't mentioned before on this show.
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:11.000]   So the general piece of advice is desperately seek
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.940]   and try to preserve sequentiality.
[00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:16.020]   Just keep thinking.
[00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:17.700]   Context switching hurts.
[00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:19.360]   Context switching hurts.
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.220]   Avoid context switches when I can.
[00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:25.780]   You wanna have an almost visceral dislike
[00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:28.020]   of switching your attention so that your instinct
[00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:30.580]   is to try to preserve your focus on one thing at a time
[00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:32.440]   before you switch.
[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:33.980]   So that might be simple in some cases.
[00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:35.580]   Okay, if I'm working on this, just work on this.
[00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:37.180]   Don't check my inbox till it's done
[00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:38.940]   and then spend 30 minutes on my inbox.
[00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:40.640]   Then work on this thing over here.
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:43.380]   Just knowing you're trying to set up your work
[00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:44.900]   to be one thing after another.
[00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:47.620]   Time block planning can help you do this much better.
[00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:49.360]   So if you time block plan,
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.360]   you lay out a plan for every minute of your day,
[00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:54.920]   you're much better able to figure out where things fit
[00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:56.360]   so everything has its time
[00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:59.040]   and you can give that thing its full attention
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:00.480]   when it's actually happening.
[00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:03.540]   To really succeed with making your work more sequential,
[00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:05.360]   you also are probably gonna have to come to grips
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:07.200]   with there is less things you can actually
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.440]   productively push forward in a given day.
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:14.000]   We write ourselves these idealized work fairy tales
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.620]   in the morning about, wow, if I could actually push forward
[00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:20.040]   all six of these different things, that would be great.
[00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:21.480]   I would feel productive.
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:23.560]   But you don't actually have enough time
[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:26.200]   to give all six of the things in this example
[00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.820]   enough undistracted attention to make a difference.
[00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:30.680]   Probably should just work on three.
[00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:32.080]   We feel bad in the moment
[00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:34.520]   because we're thinking that's less productive.
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:35.800]   But when we zoom out,
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:38.520]   we see the sort of just touching on these things
[00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:41.260]   wasn't helping when there was too much of a crowded schedule.
[00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:42.320]   We were just sending out
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:44.840]   the proverbial thoughts question mark email
[00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:47.100]   to just try to play obligation hot potato
[00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:48.320]   and get things off our plate.
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:51.000]   And just to say, technically speaking, I talked about this.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.820]   We stall, we delay, we obfuscate, we do low quality work.
[00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:56.220]   So we also have to be more comfortable
[00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:57.620]   with there's less things per day
[00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:59.860]   than we think that we can actually deal with.
[00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:02.380]   So that's the general advice here
[00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:05.080]   is develop an aversion to context switching,
[00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:06.180]   use time block planning
[00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:08.140]   to better lay out tasks during the day
[00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:10.340]   and get comfortable with actually doing fewer things
[00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:12.020]   in a day 'cause you're probably already
[00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:13.120]   trying to do too much.
[00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:16.240]   All right, now what's my super secret piece
[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:18.240]   of specific advice?
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:22.920]   Well, I wanna tackle your email inbox in particular.
[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:26.600]   I think this is one of the most devastating vectors
[00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:28.840]   of context switching exhaustion.
[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:31.720]   There is fewer things more daunting
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:36.400]   for your brain's attentional system than a crowded inbox.
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:38.360]   And the reason is, is when you see a crowded inbox,
[00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:41.360]   you have dozens of things that you need to respond to
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:45.180]   on dozens of different contexts.
[00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:47.420]   So as you go from email to email,
[00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:49.540]   you are drastically switching
[00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:53.580]   the relevant cognitive context from message to message.
[00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:56.420]   And this is incredibly draining.
[00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:58.940]   So you have an email from your department chair
[00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:00.420]   and it's urgent and it's salient,
[00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:01.820]   it's someone that you work for
[00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:03.540]   and you wanna answer them quickly,
[00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:05.420]   but you have to try to load up this context
[00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:07.420]   of all of the issues surrounding the committee
[00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:09.140]   that he's asking you about.
[00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:10.920]   And then two minutes later,
[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:12.140]   you have an email from a student
[00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:13.060]   in one of your classes.
[00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:15.380]   This is a completely different cognitive context.
[00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:16.760]   All right, the class, what's going on,
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:19.540]   what's our schedule, who's the student.
[00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:21.740]   But before you can switch completely over that context,
[00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:24.020]   you have an email from an administrator,
[00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:25.580]   a scheduling question.
[00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:26.940]   That's a completely different context.
[00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:29.700]   Oh my God, like what is going on with my schedule?
[00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:30.860]   Do I have time for this?
[00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:32.300]   Let me see my calendar.
[00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:36.380]   This is a massive demand you are making on a brain
[00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:38.480]   that is used to being much more sequential.
[00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:40.980]   And it's why email clearing in particular
[00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:43.100]   can be one of the most exhausting activities
[00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:44.660]   we have in knowledge work is because
[00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:47.540]   it is pushing this context switching pace
[00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:49.960]   to completely unsustainable levels.
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:52.880]   So here's my specific piece of advice
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:54.460]   about this specific source
[00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:56.560]   of acute context switching overload.
[00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:59.240]   Single thread your inbox.
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:02.180]   Here's what I mean about this.
[00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:04.500]   This is entirely using context theory
[00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:07.660]   to make your inbox worse, less worse.
[00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:08.700]   You have your inbox open,
[00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:10.520]   you wanna catch up on emails.
[00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:13.420]   Choose a single context
[00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:14.980]   for which there are multiple messages.
[00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:17.540]   So messages from students,
[00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:19.500]   messages about scheduling things,
[00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:21.560]   messages about this upcoming conference
[00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:23.260]   that I'm organizing.
[00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:24.580]   And what you were gonna do
[00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:27.260]   is just focus on the messages
[00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:31.140]   that all fall within the same cognitive context.
[00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:33.700]   And I want you to load up right next to your inbox,
[00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:35.700]   a blank text file.
[00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:36.860]   We call these on the show,
[00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:38.780]   working memory.txt files.
[00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:40.560]   So the sort of a blank text file
[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:42.040]   right there on your browser.
[00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:45.160]   And you are gonna type in a quick one sentence summary
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.960]   of every email of that context.
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:49.200]   So you have a bunch of student questions,
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:52.080]   quick summary, every email
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:54.520]   from a student that's in your inbox.
[00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:56.320]   Then you're gonna go over to this text file
[00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:57.840]   and say, okay, I forget the inbox.
[00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:59.280]   I don't wanna see these other messages.
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:00.440]   I forget all that.
[00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:02.280]   Here are six or seven things
[00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:05.280]   that are all related to the same cognitive context.
[00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:08.400]   Let me think through my answers to all of these.
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:11.740]   Yes, no, I'm not gonna delay this.
[00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:12.580]   I'm gonna ask this.
[00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:13.420]   And write, I'm talking,
[00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:15.260]   write bullet points in your text file.
[00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:17.900]   You're tackling all these things together.
[00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:19.620]   And you're gonna find that as you get going,
[00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:20.540]   the friction reduces
[00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:22.580]   because as the single relevant context
[00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:24.820]   gets loaded up into your neural circuitry,
[00:17:24.820 --> 00:17:27.460]   the facility of thinking about this,
[00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:29.140]   the ease with which you can come up with ideas
[00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:30.380]   is going to increase and increase.
[00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:32.180]   And it's gonna be like, okay, great, I'm on it.
[00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:33.800]   You're gonna have pretty nuanced answers.
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:34.820]   Okay, great, this is great.
[00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:37.500]   Actually, let me tell these three students to wait to hear.
[00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:38.580]   These two students are wondering
[00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:39.740]   about the timing of this exam.
[00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:40.580]   You know what?
[00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:41.420]   I should move that exam.
[00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:43.020]   Okay, so who do I need to tell the TA?
[00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:44.500]   And you're just in a context.
[00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:46.300]   You come up and you work out all of your answers.
[00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:47.880]   Then you go back to your inbox.
[00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:49.420]   You translate that to responses
[00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:50.660]   to each of those relevant emails.
[00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:53.060]   You clear them out of your inbox.
[00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:54.900]   Right, okay, thread over.
[00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:56.980]   What's my next contextual thread?
[00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:59.100]   Maybe there's a bunch of different things
[00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:00.180]   about scheduling and meetings.
[00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:01.820]   Okay, now I'm in meetings mode.
[00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:04.340]   Over here, every single meeting message
[00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:06.860]   I'm gonna put a line in my text file.
[00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:08.580]   Any dates that they're suggesting,
[00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:10.900]   okay, I need to find a date next week.
[00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:11.900]   I need to suggest a date.
[00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:14.020]   Here's dates they're suggesting I need to choose one.
[00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:16.000]   All that information in your text file.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.860]   Close down your inbox, load up your calendar,
[00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:19.220]   load up your text file,
[00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:20.660]   and you're just working on scheduling now.
[00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:21.860]   That's all you're doing.
[00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:24.900]   Again, you're gonna find after a few minutes
[00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:28.380]   as the context loads and you stop trying to interrupt it,
[00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:29.820]   you become a scheduling master.
[00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:31.140]   Oh, you know, I'm gonna move this here
[00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:32.260]   and we consolidate these.
[00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:33.180]   I'm gonna move that meeting.
[00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:34.420]   And if I clear out this Tuesday,
[00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:35.420]   I can fit these all on here.
[00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:38.500]   And then you go back and you answer all these emails.
[00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:40.700]   It's funny because in the end,
[00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:43.780]   maybe you're answering the same total collection of emails
[00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:44.620]   when you're done.
[00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:47.900]   The experience though is gonna be 5X less exhausting.
[00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:51.140]   And it's because you're hacking context shifting.
[00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:52.420]   You're sticking in one context
[00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:53.900]   till you're done, then another.
[00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:56.620]   So single threading your inbox
[00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:58.940]   can drastically change your experience
[00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:01.900]   of what it's like to empty your inbox
[00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:04.940]   and really minimize the contrail of fatigue
[00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:07.540]   that inbox checking can otherwise leave
[00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:09.500]   across your mental sky.
[00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:12.460]   So that's a specific tip.
[00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:14.300]   Before I gave you some general advice as well,
[00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:16.780]   but all of this is wrapped around the same idea.
[00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:22.300]   Is it's a detour or a diversion
[00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:25.540]   when we think too much just about how much am I working?
[00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:26.900]   And if I just had less hours of work,
[00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:28.660]   I'd be less exhausted.
[00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:30.900]   That's not what's causing the issue with knowledge workers.
[00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:32.900]   It's the context shifting itself.
[00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:34.220]   And that is something we can,
[00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:36.060]   as individuals do something about.
[00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:37.780]   It's definitely something that organizations
[00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:39.540]   and bosses and managers could do something about,
[00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:42.700]   but I wouldn't be holding my breath about that.
[00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:44.860]   But it's all about why are we tired?
[00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:47.420]   Well, in large part, because we're scheduling our work
[00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:49.740]   in a way that is designed to exhaust our brains.
[00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:51.540]   Stop doing that.
[00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:53.060]   You still have a lot of other issues to deal with,
[00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:55.900]   but at least things are gonna get a lot better.
[00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:58.300]   You might not be able to have Robert Caro's
[00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:00.860]   eight hours in a row of just reading articles,
[00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:02.820]   but getting closer to that ideal
[00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:05.180]   is going to lower the amount of exhaustion
[00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:07.420]   that you're gonna feel by the end of the day.
[00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:10.860]   - I think Caro still uses a typewriter.
[00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:13.380]   - I believe it.
[00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:16.660]   - At least he did when it was profiled in the New York Times
[00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:19.060]   he was on 60 minutes once.
[00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:19.900]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:24.740]   They start to slow him down, stay, not be distracted.
[00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:26.900]   I mean, these are extremes.
[00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:28.740]   Caro's an extreme, Popova's an extreme.
[00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:30.500]   Like they just read and write.
[00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:31.940]   Like that's all they do.
[00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:34.140]   But I do think it's important to study these extremes
[00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:38.420]   'cause when you study people who do produce huge volumes
[00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:41.220]   of high level knowledge work, you often see this,
[00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:43.380]   they minimize, they naturally lean
[00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:45.580]   towards minimizing context shifting.
[00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:46.700]   And I think in normal knowledge work,
[00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:48.140]   we just don't think about context shifting
[00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:49.820]   as an enemy at all.
[00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:51.500]   I think we should, it's productivity poison.
[00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:52.900]   So once we recognize that,
[00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:55.980]   it can really change a lot of habits.
[00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:59.740]   All right, so what we have is a bunch of questions
[00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:03.340]   and a case study, a live case study actually coming up
[00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:05.740]   where we have someone calling in to give their case study
[00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:10.100]   about trying to do a Robert Caro style book writing project
[00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:11.860]   in the middle of an otherwise busy family
[00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:12.700]   and professional life.
[00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:13.580]   So we've got some great questions
[00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:15.500]   and a case study coming up.
[00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:18.640]   First, however, I wanna talk about one of the sponsors
[00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:20.100]   that makes this show possible.
[00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:25.100]   In particular, Deep Questions is sponsored by BetterHelp.
[00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:29.300]   So fall is often a busy time for a lot of people.
[00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:31.740]   Maybe you're finding that racing thoughts
[00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:33.460]   are keeping you up at night
[00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:37.020]   or anxiety about all sorts of different things
[00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:38.700]   is getting in the way of the activities
[00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:43.700]   that you used to find really relaxing or engaging.
[00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:46.140]   It turns out there's a good way to deal
[00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:48.140]   with these ruminations and these racing thoughts,
[00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:52.860]   and that is working with a professional therapist.
[00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:57.440]   If you were an athlete and your knee was bothering you,
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:59.540]   you would say, "I want a professional to help me
[00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:01.040]   "with my knee so it'd stop bothering me
[00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:03.300]   "because it's making it hard for me to do my work."
[00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:04.380]   Well, if you're a knowledge worker
[00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:06.900]   and your brain is all over the place,
[00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:09.900]   why not get a professional to help you build
[00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:12.300]   a better relationship with your thoughts,
[00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:15.980]   to find a way to still have great joy in meeting your life,
[00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:19.700]   even with difficulties going on cognitively?
[00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:21.260]   Now, of course, the issue with therapy,
[00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:22.900]   even if you are considering it,
[00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:25.420]   is that it can seem daunting
[00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:27.440]   from a logistical perspective.
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:29.180]   How do I find a therapist?
[00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:31.440]   Are they available?
[00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:32.280]   Are they good?
[00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:33.380]   What if I don't like them?
[00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:35.400]   What if there's not a lot of therapists near where I live?
[00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:37.300]   There could just be no availabilities
[00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:39.420]   in the physical offices that are near me.
[00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:43.320]   This is where BetterHelp enters the picture.
[00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:44.640]   If you're thinking about starting therapy,
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:47.440]   you should give BetterHelp a try.
[00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:49.720]   It's entirely online.
[00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:51.960]   It's designed to be convenient, flexible,
[00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:53.600]   and suited to your schedule.
[00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:55.360]   You just fill out a brief questionnaire,
[00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:57.740]   and you will get matched with a licensed therapist.
[00:22:57.740 --> 00:22:59.460]   You can switch therapists at any time
[00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:00.900]   for no additional charge.
[00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:03.500]   So now is the time to build
[00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:05.220]   that better relationship with your mind.
[00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:09.420]   BetterHelp has made that easier than it's ever been before.
[00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:12.700]   So get a break from your thoughts with BetterHelp.

[00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:17.820]   Is it /deepquestions, Jesse?
[00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:18.660]   - Yep, that's it.
[00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:22.580]   - /deepquestions today to get 10% off your first month.
[00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:27.580]   That's betterhelp, H-E-L-P, .com/deepquestions.
[00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:32.460]   Another thing that I think is really important to consider
[00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:35.380]   is the closeness of your shave.
[00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:37.500]   Long-time listeners know I am a big fan
[00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:41.040]   and user of Henson Shaving.
[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:43.760]   Nerds love Henson Shaving, and I'll tell you why.
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:46.700]   Because they are a precision aerospace parts
[00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:50.080]   manufacturing company that use their precision equipment
[00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:54.740]   to build the ultimate shaving razor.
[00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:57.120]   Precision really matters in building a good razor
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:59.060]   because what they're able to do
[00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:01.000]   is build this beautiful aluminum body
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.620]   where you can add a just standard
[00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:04.580]   10 cent safety razor blade to it.
[00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:08.900]   You screw it on top, and it's so precisely milled
[00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:11.340]   that you have just a bare edge of the blade
[00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:12.600]   come beyond the body.
[00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:15.860]   Now that just having just a little bit of blade stick out
[00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:18.300]   means you get a close shave without the diving board effect
[00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:21.160]   that creates nicks, that creates clogs.
[00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:23.280]   So by using a Henson's razor,
[00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:26.120]   this beautifully precisely milled piece of aluminum,
[00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:29.860]   you get a great shave using standard 10 cent blades.
[00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:34.880]   So what's cool about this is you save money over time.
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:36.980]   You spend more up front to get this beautiful tool
[00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:40.960]   that they milled with their precision aerospace machines,
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:42.920]   but you're not paying those expensive
[00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:44.660]   monthly subscription fees you would
[00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:45.940]   for a subscription service.
[00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:47.920]   You're not having to go back to the drug store
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:50.920]   and buy those incredibly expensive 19 blade
[00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:53.400]   plastic vibrating things that they sell there.
[00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:56.720]   So pretty soon financially you end up on top
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:59.560]   if you're using the Henson razor
[00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:01.000]   because the blades are so cheap,
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.760]   it doesn't take long before you've amortized
[00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:05.840]   that initial startup cost and it's much cheaper to sustain.
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:08.520]   So it's a cool tool built by cool people
[00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:10.040]   that gives you a great shave,
[00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:12.760]   and it's much more cheaper to maintain over time
[00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:15.080]   than the other options.
[00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:17.000]   So it's time to say no to subscriptions
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.600]   and yes to a razor that will last you a lifetime.
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:22.720]   Visit hensonshaving.com/cal,
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:25.120]   the picked a razor for you and use code CAL
[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:28.160]   and you'll get two years worth of blades for free.
[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:30.680]   Just make sure that you add the two years worth of blades
[00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:31.760]   to your shopping cart,
[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:33.600]   and then when you enter the promo code CAL,
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:36.980]   the cost of those blades will drop down to zero.
[00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:41.280]   That's 100 free blades when you head to H-E-N-S-O-N,
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:46.280]   S-H-A-V-I-N-G.com/cal and use that code.
[00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:48.080]   Cal.
[00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:51.080]   All right, so we're gonna move on now to some questions.
[00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:55.280]   I guess these all roughly orbit mental exhaustion,
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:56.560]   tiredness, you know,
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:59.600]   well, we do our best to keep the theme somewhat on theme.
[00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:01.400]   Later in the questions, as I previewed before,
[00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:03.000]   we're gonna have someone calling in
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   to give their case study about using some of these ideas.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.480]   So stay tuned for that.
[00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:08.600]   But let's just get started with a standard question.
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:11.280]   Jesse, who is our first question of the segment?
[00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:13.240]   - First question's from John.
[00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:15.480]   How do I read for longer stretches of time?
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:17.640]   I wanna be able to read for 90 minutes in one sitting,
[00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:18.560]   but I just can't.
[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:20.220]   The best I can do is 45 minutes,
[00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:22.040]   and by the end I'm falling asleep.
[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:24.480]   How do I build up my reading stamina?
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:26.360]   - Well, John, first of all,
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:28.080]   let's go back to what we talked about
[00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:30.640]   in the opening segment of the show
[00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:32.940]   and be very wary about context shifts.
[00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:35.880]   So we are so used to today
[00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:40.460]   having this easy access to distraction in our pockets
[00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:43.400]   that we don't even note it as an activity.
[00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:45.260]   So when you say here,
[00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:46.660]   you know, I can read for 45 minutes,
[00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:48.800]   but then I'm very tired by the end.
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:50.640]   You think you're reading for 45 minutes.
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:52.840]   The neutral observer is probably seeing
[00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:54.760]   seven or eight smartphone checks.
[00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:55.960]   I'm gonna check this text message
[00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:57.840]   and see what's happening with the baseball game.
[00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:58.920]   So keep this in mind.
[00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:01.360]   Every one of those checks is inducing a context shift,
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:03.000]   which is incredibly fatiguing.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.400]   So of course you're not gonna make it very far.
[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:07.600]   It's like saying, I wanna go for a 5K run,
[00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:09.000]   but let me just bring this wheelbarrow
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.760]   full of metal slag with me.
[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:14.100]   It's a huge extra cognitive weight that you are adding,
[00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:16.320]   which makes the activity all the more harder.
[00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:17.920]   So the easiest thing you can do
[00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:20.960]   is when you read your phones in a different room.
[00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:24.800]   That alone is gonna give you 30 to 50% more reading stamina
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:26.440]   without changing anything else.
[00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:29.440]   All right, so then how do we expand beyond that?
[00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:31.460]   Let's say we wanna get all the way up to 90 minutes
[00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:33.280]   or two hours at a sitting.
[00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:36.640]   There, the two-part solution is gonna be two things
[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:38.700]   that start with the letter I,
[00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:41.720]   interval training and interesting books.
[00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:44.560]   So the second piece is the easiest.
[00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:47.440]   When you're trying to expand your reading capacity,
[00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:50.600]   read the most interesting possible books.
[00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:53.840]   Do not use "Anna Karenina" as the book you're gonna use
[00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:56.860]   for trying to expand your reading capacity.
[00:27:56.860 --> 00:27:59.360]   Don't read "Thomas Pynchon" as the book you're gonna read
[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:00.600]   to expand your reading capacity.
[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:02.760]   Get a book that you were like super excited to read
[00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:03.680]   when it came out
[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:06.600]   and that you have a hard time putting down.
[00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:08.060]   Think about this as the running equivalent
[00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:10.780]   of don't start to get in shape for your 5Ks
[00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:12.480]   by running up a really steep hill.
[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:16.800]   Maybe go on a flat, nice track that has a lot of give.
[00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:18.920]   All right, interval training.
[00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:20.060]   The technique that I developed
[00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:22.160]   when I used to work with undergraduates
[00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:25.660]   who are trying to build up their capacity for studying.
[00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:27.840]   And all you would do is get a timer.
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:28.960]   And we would set the timer for,
[00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:31.040]   okay, how long are you gonna read?
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:34.520]   And until this timer goes off, focus on the reading.
[00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:37.040]   If your attention wanders, bring it right back.
[00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:39.180]   And you start that timer at something that's reasonable,
[00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:40.140]   but somewhat ambitious.
[00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:43.000]   So maybe 30 minutes, maybe 45 minutes.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.240]   And once you're able to do that
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:45.840]   for a couple of weeks at a time,
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:48.720]   you increase it by about 15 minutes for the next sessions.
[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:50.160]   Okay, now I'm going for a full hour
[00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:51.880]   and then it's gonna get difficult for a while.
[00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:54.200]   Okay, I can get through about 45 minutes, no problem.
[00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:56.280]   That final 15 minutes, I'm struggling.
[00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:57.720]   But my timer is here.
[00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:00.200]   I see there's only 15 minutes left.
[00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:01.600]   There's a clear goal.
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:02.940]   I wanna make it.
[00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:05.120]   So I will power through.
[00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:06.220]   Now it seems like a little thing,
[00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:07.920]   whether you have a timer on or not,
[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:10.080]   but it makes a big psychological difference.
[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:13.160]   If you're just saying read as long as you can,
[00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:14.400]   the voice in your head saying,
[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:16.400]   "Check your phone, check your phone,"
[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:17.640]   has a pretty strong argument
[00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:19.120]   because they can say you're gonna stop reading
[00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:22.520]   at some point anyway, so why not stop now?
[00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:24.360]   But when you have a timer
[00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:25.600]   and there's that voice in your head saying,
[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:27.400]   "Check your phone, check your phone,"
[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:30.360]   you say, "Well, I can wait nine more minutes."
[00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:32.200]   You know, you have a clarity there.
[00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:34.960]   So then once you get used to the new expanded interval,
[00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:36.800]   which might take a couple of weeks,
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:38.500]   you add 15 more minutes.
[00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:39.760]   So it's interval training.
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:42.080]   You stretch until that stretch is no longer a stretch
[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:44.120]   and then you increase it some more.
[00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:46.120]   You can get the 90 minutes
[00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:48.000]   based on my experience working with undergrads
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.440]   in roughly a semester, so in a few months,
[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:51.840]   if you're pretty careful about it.
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:52.680]   So there we go.
[00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:54.760]   Interesting books plus interval training
[00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:56.640]   and a rule of zero context shifting,
[00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:59.280]   you can significantly increase your stamina
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:02.320]   for concentrating on the written word.
[00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:05.160]   All right, Jesse, what do we got next?
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:07.160]   - I like that timer stuff.
[00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:09.400]   All right, next question is from Joel.
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:11.440]   "I'm getting the recommended eight hours of sleep
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:13.560]   "every night, but constantly feel exhausted,
[00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:16.020]   "both when I wake up and throughout the day.
[00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:17.760]   "I've been watching videos on the importance
[00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:19.600]   "of limiting screen time before bed,
[00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:23.080]   "and I think I may be a culprit for my bad sleep.
[00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:25.540]   "Do you have any advice on ways to reduce screen time
[00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:28.120]   "before bed as I find it very addicting
[00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:30.480]   "and hard to break that habit?"
[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:34.160]   - I love the irony of watching videos
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:36.080]   about how to reduce screen time.
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:39.240]   I imagine him, Joel, up late, late into the night,
[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:42.740]   watching videos about how to not watch videos before bed.
[00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:45.760]   All sorts of contradictions and irony
[00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:47.720]   in the online productivity space,
[00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:49.520]   as the channels are exactly the causes
[00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:51.800]   of productivity issues in the first place.
[00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:53.040]   All right, Joel, a couple of things here.
[00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:54.120]   I mean, first of all, of course,
[00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:55.560]   if you're tired throughout the day
[00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:57.160]   and you're getting enough sleep,
[00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:59.440]   if you actually are getting enough sleep,
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:01.720]   go back to the opening segment of the show,
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:04.020]   make sure that you're not excessively context shifting.
[00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:06.520]   Some of that tiredness may actually be mental fatigue
[00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:08.880]   and not actual rundown tiredness.
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:10.200]   So you wanna just set up your day
[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:12.880]   to be less unnecessarily exhausting.
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:14.920]   But if we're gonna focus specifically on this issue
[00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:17.740]   of your sleep being disrupted,
[00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:21.740]   I mean, I agree that good sleep hygiene can help.
[00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:26.860]   And going on to, I think the right way to think about it
[00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:29.480]   is highly salient, highly distracting,
[00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:33.600]   highly arousing content should not be consumed near bed.
[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:35.800]   So anything where it's coming through an app
[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:39.760]   that makes money by how much time you look at it,
[00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:41.800]   avoiding that I think is important.
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:44.260]   So you should not go on YouTube before bed.
[00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:47.520]   You should not go onto Instagram or Twitter or TikTok.
[00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:50.000]   Anything that's attention engineered
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.400]   is gonna be a problem because again,
[00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:52.980]   these services, those services work.
[00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:55.280]   Services you don't pay to use work by getting you
[00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:57.200]   to look at the service longer.
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:00.300]   So they're gonna be pressing buttons within your brain
[00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:02.440]   to get a response that makes you very engaged
[00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:04.640]   and aroused emotionally and wanting to actually come back
[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:05.840]   and keep watching more.
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:08.580]   That's not a great state to be in if you wanna go to bed.
[00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:11.360]   So if you're gonna be looking at a screen before bed,
[00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:13.520]   a general rule of thumb here is look at things
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:15.120]   where they don't make money off of you
[00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:16.640]   spending more time on it.
[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:20.800]   So if there's the office on Peacock,
[00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:22.680]   like I watch an episode or two of "The Office"
[00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:24.700]   'cause it's comforting and it's dumb,
[00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:26.960]   that's gonna have much less of a negative impact, right?
[00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:28.380]   These streaming services make money
[00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:29.760]   by you paying a subscription fee.
[00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:32.040]   So they wanna make sure there's stuff on there you like,
[00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:34.120]   but they don't particularly care
[00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:36.520]   if you binge for seven hours in a row or not.
[00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:37.800]   They're just, here's, we have a bunch of shows
[00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:38.680]   we think you'll like.
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:40.440]   So there's a real difference.
[00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:42.320]   They both seem like screens,
[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:45.120]   but watching a comforting, somewhat boring show
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:47.240]   could actually help your brain calm down
[00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:49.200]   in a way that watching TikTok videos
[00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:50.560]   or following YouTube recommendations
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:53.080]   might actually get your brain fired up.
[00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:55.560]   So the intent of the platform,
[00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:58.400]   is it an engagement or is it customer experience?
[00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:01.480]   Makes a difference on how it's gonna affect your sleep.
[00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:02.800]   The other thing I wanna throw in here,
[00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:04.440]   that's sort of the curve ball,
[00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:06.400]   is another common sleep disruptor.
[00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:08.500]   It's not necessarily what you do right before bed,
[00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:10.400]   but what's happening inside your head.
[00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:15.880]   If your head is keeping track of a lot of open loops,
[00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:17.600]   to use a term from David Allen,
[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:19.040]   tasks that you're responsible for,
[00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:20.460]   projects you need to work on,
[00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:22.920]   ideas that might lead to cool opportunities.
[00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:25.480]   If you have a lot of these things
[00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:27.480]   that exist primarily in your head,
[00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:31.400]   and if you forget about them, it's gonna be a problem.
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:33.600]   Your brain is gonna have a hard time falling asleep
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:34.920]   because it feels like the juggler
[00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:37.520]   where the things it's juggling are very fragile and valuable
[00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:40.720]   and doesn't wanna drop anything, so it has to keep moving.
[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:42.600]   So ironically, one of the biggest things you can do
[00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:44.700]   to help you sleep at night,
[00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:48.480]   is be better about how you control your work during the day,
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:50.480]   being better about how you shut down your work
[00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:52.300]   at the end of the day.
[00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:54.800]   Organizational systems that are built around notions
[00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:57.680]   like full capture and planning.
[00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:00.000]   So every task that you need to do that you've committed to
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.680]   is captured in a trusted location that you review regularly
[00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:04.480]   so your brain doesn't have to keep track of it,
[00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:06.520]   makes a huge difference for your sleep.
[00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:07.920]   Multi-scale planning.
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:09.400]   I have a plan for my season,
[00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:11.120]   which gets turned into plans for my week,
[00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:13.120]   which gets turned into plans for my day,
[00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:16.240]   so that my brain doesn't have to just keep thinking,
[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:17.280]   hey, what am I working on?
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:18.420]   What should I be working on?
[00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:20.440]   Should I be thinking more about this or that?
[00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:21.280]   Helps you sleep.
[00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:26.200]   Having, in general, a good shutdown routine.
[00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:28.620]   Okay, the day is over before I shut down work.
[00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:32.160]   Let me check all of the inboxes, my email, my plan,
[00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:34.620]   making sure that everything has a place.
[00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:36.320]   Anything that came up has been written down.
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:37.480]   I know what's happening tomorrow.
[00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:40.160]   There's nothing I need to be keeping track of.
[00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:41.000]   We have a good plan.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.360]   Everything's captured, great.
[00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:46.120]   Let me now check that shutdown complete checkbox
[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:48.600]   in my time block planner,
[00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:50.960]   or have a ritual or phrase I say.
[00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:54.440]   And so later, if my mind starts to get ruminative
[00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:56.200]   about work, I can say, no, no, no.
[00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:58.440]   I checked that checkbox in my time block planner.
[00:34:58.440 --> 00:34:59.320]   I said that phrase.
[00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:01.360]   That means I successfully reviewed
[00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:02.520]   and shut down all open loops.
[00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:04.240]   I don't have to worry about things till tomorrow.
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:06.140]   That makes a big difference for sleep.
[00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:08.320]   All right, so to summarize,
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:10.480]   we have a couple of different things going on here.
[00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:12.900]   Be careful about what screens you expose yourself to
[00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:14.160]   before bed.
[00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:15.660]   It's probably gonna be easier
[00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:17.360]   if you have a bedtime screen habit
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:18.960]   to just change what you look at
[00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:20.780]   than it will be to just cold turkey stop
[00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:22.300]   looking at a screen before bed.
[00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:23.980]   Just shift your screens to things
[00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:28.040]   that's not emotionally salient or emotionally arousing.
[00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:31.520]   And then care a lot about how you organize your work,
[00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:34.160]   open loops, shutdowns, and multi-scale planning.
[00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:37.040]   And finally, make sure that some of your daytime exhaustion
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:38.400]   is not actually from context shifting
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:39.720]   as opposed to sleep disruption.
[00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:41.140]   Those are my three points, Joel.
[00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:43.760]   I think all three of those things combined
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:44.920]   will make a difference.
[00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:47.680]   I'm noticing, Jesse, we got,
[00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:51.480]   not only do we have a bunch of J names in a row,
[00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:53.240]   but the next name is literally JJ.
[00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:56.920]   It's as if we go through our questions alphabetically.
[00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:57.760]   I like it.
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:59.320]   Fortunately, it's the last of the J names.
[00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:01.160]   I wish we had more, but anyways,
[00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:02.400]   after John and Joel,
[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:05.920]   let's get rolling with what JJ has to ask us.
[00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:07.080]   - Yep.
[00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:09.080]   So JJ has to say,
[00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:11.480]   "I'm constantly feeling stressed during the evenings
[00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:14.480]   when I'm not at work because I feel like I'm wasting time.
[00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:16.240]   I wanna constantly be improving myself,
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:18.480]   but I also wanna take time to do fun things,
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:21.140]   video games, see friends, et cetera.
[00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:22.160]   What should I do?"
[00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:25.040]   - Right, so this could be an issue for people
[00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:28.680]   who care a lot about productivity writ large
[00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:30.120]   is evenings can be stressful.
[00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:33.780]   It can be stressful because if you're not doing
[00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:39.260]   anything structured, you feel just unnerved.
[00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:41.460]   You practice multiscale planning,
[00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:43.300]   your workday is time block planned,
[00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:45.640]   it's connected to a weekly plan and a seasonal plan,
[00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:48.440]   and it can feel unnerving to be just around.
[00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:51.840]   Feel unproductive, but then you're worried about like,
[00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:53.440]   well, what do I wanna do is if I treat my day
[00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:54.640]   like my workday, that's exhausting
[00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:56.480]   because it's also really hard to be very structured
[00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:57.320]   during the workday.
[00:36:57.320 --> 00:37:01.000]   And so you can be in a dilemma like JJ is in as well.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:05.080]   So the two things I recommend in this situation is one,
[00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:07.480]   clear separation between work and non-work, okay?
[00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:09.560]   So clear shutdown routine.
[00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:12.160]   We just talked about this in the answer
[00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:16.040]   that I gave to Joel in the previous question.
[00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:17.720]   So you really can shut down work.
[00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:21.160]   That'll help your mind leave the work productivity mindset
[00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:23.760]   of we are constantly trying to keep track
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:26.080]   of what's going on and making sure nothing's being misplaced
[00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:27.160]   and we're making good use of your time.
[00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:31.260]   You wanna clear shutdown so your mindset can shift.
[00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:33.000]   But the second thing I would advise
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:36.880]   is that especially if you're an organized person,
[00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:38.600]   having no plan is overrated.
[00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:43.320]   We often tell ourselves that the solution
[00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:48.320]   to maybe the exhaustion we feel from work is nothingness.
[00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:51.840]   The goal is if I could just have nothing to do,
[00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:55.400]   then no plan, no intention.
[00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:57.520]   That will be the opposite of having too much to do
[00:37:57.520 --> 00:37:59.920]   and I'm gonna find relaxation and rejuvenation.
[00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:01.960]   Actually does not work that way for a lot of people,
[00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:04.100]   especially if you're organized, having nothing to do,
[00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:06.320]   having no plan is stressful.
[00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:10.560]   And you get that unnerving feeling that you talk about.
[00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:11.760]   So what's the right thing to do?
[00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:15.560]   Sketch a plan, but make sure that plan is varied
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:17.340]   and rejuvenating and interesting.
[00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:19.960]   The problem that people have,
[00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:21.660]   what stresses us out about work
[00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:23.480]   is not the fact that we have things to do.
[00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:25.160]   It's not the fact that we have a plan.
[00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:26.720]   It's just that we have too many things
[00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:28.600]   to switch back and forth behind us
[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:30.280]   because the work is hard, the work is stressful.
[00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:31.240]   It's not the plan itself,
[00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:33.280]   it's what the plan is actually is in the plan.
[00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:34.140]   Work is hard.
[00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:37.320]   You sketch a plan after your shutdown,
[00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:39.040]   it shouldn't be a detailed time block plan.
[00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:40.720]   Be like, yeah, I wanna get a reading session in
[00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:43.280]   and work out and then why don't we watch this show
[00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:45.000]   with the kids that I've been reading about
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:45.880]   and think it's gonna be special.
[00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:48.200]   And I wanna make sure that I have a,
[00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:49.640]   go for a walk before we get ready for bed.
[00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:52.020]   You sort of sketch a plan of things that are meaningful
[00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:54.740]   and useful for the family and useful for yourself
[00:38:54.740 --> 00:38:56.820]   and varied and rejuvenating.
[00:38:56.820 --> 00:38:58.580]   And it's not a tight minute by minute plan.
[00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:01.060]   You're actually gonna feel much better about that.
[00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:03.780]   So again, the key to get away from the stress
[00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:08.780]   of a busy workday is not to significantly reduce what you do.
[00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:12.060]   It's not to significantly reduce the idea of having a plan.
[00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:14.900]   It's to make the things you do much better.
[00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:17.060]   To make the things that you've planned to do fun
[00:39:17.060 --> 00:39:19.600]   or interesting or useful to the world
[00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:21.560]   beyond the world of work and completely unconnected.
[00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:24.920]   So shut down work, shift to non-work mode,
[00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:27.360]   but then say, I wanna hit the pillow proud tonight.
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:28.560]   Like what do I wanna do with my time
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:30.880]   that makes this an evening that I'm proud of?
[00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:32.640]   And it has nothing to do with productivity.
[00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:34.840]   It's not how do I achieve this or get ahead of this?
[00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:37.160]   It's like, how do I like get time
[00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:38.960]   to read this book I really like?
[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:40.200]   How do I get some one-on-one time
[00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:42.720]   with like my oldest son who I haven't seen recently?
[00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:46.560]   You wanna make intentional use of your time,
[00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:50.220]   which is separate from some notion of optimizing time
[00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:52.340]   or maximizing output.
[00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:54.040]   So doing little can be stressful.
[00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:55.600]   I mean, there's so many books, Jesse.
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:57.920]   There's a while where do nothing, how to do nothing,
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:39:59.440]   the art of doing nothing.
[00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:02.340]   There's this whole notion of what we need to do is nothing.
[00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:04.920]   Doing nothing stresses a lot of people out.
[00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:07.580]   Like humans don't like to do nothing.
[00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:08.500]   - Yeah, because people are like
[00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:10.380]   really afraid of being bored.
[00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:13.800]   - Yeah, and boredom is actually a useful human emotion.
[00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:17.240]   Like why do we feel such a strong, distasteful,
[00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:19.520]   emotional reaction that doing nothing
[00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:22.320]   is because we're evolved to actually wanna be doing things.
[00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:25.520]   That's what drives humans to unlike a cat
[00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:27.120]   who's completely happy.
[00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:30.280]   If I can lay in the sun for seven hours and I'm a cat,
[00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:31.820]   it's a good day, right?
[00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:33.320]   Cats don't get bored.
[00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:35.120]   Humans do, but that is the drive.
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:36.360]   There's like, okay, well, what else are we gonna do?
[00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:38.480]   Well, I don't know, let's invent fire
[00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:41.840]   or organize a political system or invent religion.
[00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:44.520]   Like the boredom is part of what drove humans
[00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:47.120]   to take advantage of this larger brain that we grew.
[00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:50.520]   So, boredom is important indicator.
[00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:51.360]   The key is, I mean, again,
[00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:53.120]   people are not stressed out by doing things.
[00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:55.360]   They're stressed out by what they're doing.
[00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:56.720]   The reasonableness of what they're doing,
[00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:58.240]   whether they have enough time to do it,
[00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:01.820]   the actual demands of the work they're doing.
[00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:04.480]   That's what's stressful, not the doing itself.
[00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:07.800]   I mean, you can stop your work and be reading
[00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:11.880]   and woodworking and movies, watching sports,
[00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:13.540]   all sorts of things you can do, which are things,
[00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:15.400]   but they're very different than work.
[00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:17.720]   It's really the content of activity,
[00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:21.400]   not so much the planning around activity.
[00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:23.320]   Planning itself is not too stressful.
[00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:26.760]   - Yeah, actually Lex had Yuval Harari on
[00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:28.880]   like a couple weeks ago and I listened to that.
[00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:32.200]   They were talking about like civilization and boredom.
[00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:33.160]   - Oh, interesting.
[00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:37.280]   Yeah, Yuval's real big on the conceptual,
[00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:38.880]   the cognitive conceptual developments
[00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:41.560]   in human evolution that just unlocked everything.
[00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:43.000]   Yeah, I'll listen to that one.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.700]   - Yeah, it was just before the Isaacson one, I think.
[00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:51.160]   - I saw someone the other day attribute Sapiens to me.
[00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:52.000]   - That's pretty good.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:52.840]   - They said Cal Newport's book, Sapiens.
[00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:54.880]   - I sold like millions and millions of copies.
[00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:57.280]   - Yeah, I was like, I like that, I suppose.
[00:41:57.280 --> 00:41:59.280]   I mean, it's probably bad news for Yuval Harari,
[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:00.720]   but I guess good news for me.
[00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:02.720]   I was like, I'll take it.
[00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:04.260]   I'll take it.
[00:42:04.260 --> 00:42:05.740]   Oh man, all right, let's keep rolling.
[00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:06.840]   What do we have next?
[00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:09.680]   All right, next question's from ETN.
[00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:13.200]   Cal, I'm a Benedictine monk in Missouri.
[00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:16.280]   I have a disagreement with a part of your deep life stack.
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:18.080]   Discipline is not an identity per se,
[00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:19.880]   but rather a tool for developing
[00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:22.320]   and solidifying an identity.
[00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:24.960]   You use value as a criteria for leading a meaningful
[00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:28.240]   and purposeful life shaped through code, ritual, and routine.
[00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:30.040]   You readily assert that you need discipline
[00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:33.260]   for a value to take hold, but discipline needs a reason.
[00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:36.160]   - Yeah, it's a good question.
[00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:37.840]   I get this debate a lot.
[00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:39.200]   I think it's one of the more unique
[00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:41.920]   and controversial aspects of my conception
[00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:44.600]   of cultivating a deep life,
[00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:46.360]   where I say discipline comes first.
[00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:49.640]   Now, ETN here disagrees.
[00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:51.840]   Part of this is semantic.
[00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:55.400]   I think discipline is an overloaded word.
[00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:59.780]   We have a lot of connotations with it, often negative.
[00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:01.440]   We think about discipline sometimes
[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:04.400]   as something being enforced upon us.
[00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:07.800]   The cruel headmaster disciplining the kids.
[00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:09.760]   We also have connotations with discipline
[00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:13.040]   with those who are idolizing,
[00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:16.060]   making a false god out of discipline itself.
[00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:21.800]   All that matters is the discipline of what I do
[00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:23.480]   and the harder things I do,
[00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:25.600]   and other people won't do these things as hard,
[00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:27.280]   and all of my self-worth just comes
[00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:30.000]   entirely from my discipline.
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   This is the sort of David Goggins-style philosophy
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.960]   of sort of building your identity
[00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:40.040]   around extreme feats of discipline.
[00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:41.760]   This was an idea that was really big
[00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:43.760]   and supported by Instagram culture
[00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:45.620]   sort of over the last decade.
[00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:47.160]   So it's an overloaded term.
[00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:48.560]   So let's use a different term
[00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:51.280]   just for this conversation, efficaciousness.
[00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:54.860]   So efficaciousness describes the degree
[00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:56.520]   to which you believe yourself able
[00:43:56.520 --> 00:44:00.320]   to actually take action towards goals.
[00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:01.720]   If you're an efficacious person,
[00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:04.320]   you say, "Yes, in general, I am someone
[00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:05.700]   "who if I have something I want to do
[00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:07.080]   "and it's reasonable, I can do it.
[00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:09.760]   "I can figure out how to do it."
[00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:12.800]   My argument, having spent a lot of time with people
[00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:14.520]   who are trying to turn around their lives,
[00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:18.240]   is that that is missing a lot of times,
[00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:20.800]   and if that is missing, nothing else works.
[00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:24.480]   Even trying to determine what your values are
[00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:27.120]   and believing that you can build your life
[00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:28.080]   around those values,
[00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:30.800]   even that seemingly fundamental decision
[00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:34.220]   lays on a foundation of efficaciousness.
[00:44:34.220 --> 00:44:36.280]   If you do not see yourself as someone
[00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:38.160]   who can take action towards important things,
[00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:40.560]   even if it's not obligated and even if it's hard,
[00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:43.320]   if you do not see yourself as a person who can do that,
[00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:45.800]   almost any other self-developmental activity
[00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:47.740]   is going to be derailed.
[00:44:47.740 --> 00:44:50.280]   It's gonna dissipate before it actually takes hold.
[00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:53.280]   Now, there's other people, and probably,
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:55.160]   Tan, I mean, you're a Benedictine monk,
[00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:58.240]   so you're probably an exemplar of this other type of person
[00:44:58.240 --> 00:45:01.360]   where they just have this strong sense of efficaciousness,
[00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:03.760]   and so what matters right off the bat then is like,
[00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:05.280]   okay, let me figure out my values
[00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:06.440]   and build my life around it,
[00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:08.800]   but most people, the average person,
[00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:10.640]   stumbles before they get there.
[00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:12.560]   So when I say discipline is an identity,
[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:16.280]   what I don't mean is, what matters is that you
[00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:18.680]   build your identity around discipline,
[00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:22.600]   that you become David Goggins or Cameron Haynes,
[00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:24.680]   that how you define yourself and your value
[00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:25.640]   is through your discipline,
[00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:27.840]   and I agree with you fully there, Atin,
[00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:30.600]   that that's false idol.
[00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:32.360]   That's not gonna get you there.
[00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:34.680]   But on the other hand, I think until you have
[00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:37.600]   built a minor foundation of efficaciousness,
[00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:39.400]   your efforts are likely gonna be wasted.
[00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:41.560]   The average person's efforts are likely gonna be wasted.
[00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:43.120]   So that's why I put discipline first.
[00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:45.600]   You have to just start by convincing yourself,
[00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:47.880]   I can do things, and there's an excitement
[00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:50.040]   and a motivation and a clarity and a drive
[00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:51.640]   that comes out of that that when you then say,
[00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:53.320]   okay, so what do I care about?
[00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:56.520]   You actually care about that question,
[00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:58.840]   and you take it more seriously,
[00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:00.360]   and the answers actually stick.
[00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:03.400]   I'm so kinda convinced about this foundational idea
[00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:04.880]   that I've been recently playing around
[00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:06.680]   with my deep life stack,
[00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:08.640]   and one of the configurations I've been playing around
[00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:12.240]   with more recently actually has a much clearer division
[00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:17.440]   between laying the foundations and then cultivating depth.
[00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:19.360]   Now, and I'm not, this is very early stages.
[00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:20.480]   I'm just throwing out ideas here,
[00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:22.720]   but one of the reconfigurations I've been playing with
[00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:24.760]   in my notebooks recently is one where
[00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:26.640]   it's not just discipline comes first,
[00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:30.680]   but maybe we're gonna do discipline, control,
[00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:32.720]   and maybe even throw in something like craft.
[00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:35.760]   So first of all, how do I convince myself I'm efficacious?
[00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:37.280]   Second of all, how do I just take control
[00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:38.480]   of all the stuff in my life,
[00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:40.400]   learn how to have control over what's on my plate
[00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:41.720]   and how it's gonna get done
[00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:43.720]   and how to take things off of my plate,
[00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:45.160]   and maybe throw in their craft.
[00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:47.640]   Okay, now let me take this out for a spin
[00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:50.440]   and show myself that I can actually get good at something.
[00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:53.040]   When I set my mind to it and almost seeing that
[00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:54.960]   in this new configuration I'm playing with,
[00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:56.040]   that's the foundation.
[00:46:56.040 --> 00:47:00.960]   Now with that foundation set, let's get serious about depth
[00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:01.800]   and that's step two.
[00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:04.320]   Now it's, okay, what do I really value?
[00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:06.960]   Now I'm ready to tackle that question seriously.
[00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:09.400]   Sacrifice, how am I sacrificing my time and attention
[00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:12.080]   on behalf of other people, community around me,
[00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:13.800]   people I care about, let's get serious about that.
[00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:15.760]   There's no meaning without that.
[00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:18.000]   And then finally escape or remarkability.
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:21.200]   Then now how do I leave my legacy?
[00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:23.800]   How do I create the remarkable aspects of my life
[00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:25.080]   built around these values?
[00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:26.280]   I mean, I'm almost seeing now
[00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:28.000]   is like a very clear separation
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   where there's this long process of just becoming,
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.320]   to borrow a term from Jocko,
[00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:34.280]   an exceptionally capable human being.
[00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:36.280]   And then once you do that, you say,
[00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:38.360]   now I can become an exceptionally deep human being.
[00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:41.040]   And I think when we sometimes swap these things around,
[00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:42.480]   it's not successful for people.
[00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:44.120]   Some people it is, but I think a lot of people
[00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:47.720]   starting with the depth before they have the capability,
[00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:50.240]   leads to a lot of self-incrimination and dissipation.
[00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:51.360]   It might lead people to believe,
[00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:53.080]   I'm just not able to do this.
[00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:55.240]   I'm just fundamentally a broken person.
[00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:57.640]   I'm trying to like build my life around values.
[00:47:57.640 --> 00:47:58.600]   I can't identify them.
[00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:00.320]   I don't trust the values I pick.
[00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:02.320]   It can almost be harmful if you jump right
[00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:04.160]   to the cultivating depth before you've done
[00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:06.960]   the boring hard work of becoming a capable human being
[00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:07.800]   in the first place.
[00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:08.640]   So I don't know, I'm still playing
[00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:09.560]   with these thoughts at teens.
[00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:12.800]   So I'd like the excuse to just discuss
[00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:13.800]   and get some more feedback.
[00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:15.440]   And I love this type of feedback,
[00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:16.520]   but that's a little bit of an insight
[00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:18.840]   into how I've been thinking about this recently.
[00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:22.000]   All right, let's do one more question
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:23.880]   before we do our live call-in case study,
[00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:25.200]   which I'm excited about.
[00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:26.040]   - Sounds good.
[00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:28.000]   Next question is from Yalan.
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:29.920]   Hi Cal, until three years ago,
[00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:31.720]   I used to be a deep life person.
[00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:33.120]   I had a schedule for each day.
[00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:35.160]   I studied a lot, slept well.
[00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:36.880]   My phone was on airplane or silent mode
[00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:39.080]   for most of the day, the usual stuff.
[00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:41.680]   But since then I've been losing my charm.
[00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:43.440]   I'm having a really hard time making time
[00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:44.880]   for studying or even reading.
[00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:46.960]   I almost never plan anything ahead anymore.
[00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:49.320]   And I've been seriously addicted to video games.
[00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:52.000]   I'm an English teacher and I have my obligations,
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:55.560]   but I never do anything beyond the obligatory area.
[00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:57.360]   What's more, being a teacher in Israel
[00:48:57.360 --> 00:48:58.840]   makes you become hooked on your phone
[00:48:58.840 --> 00:49:00.400]   because there are so many notifications,
[00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:02.760]   updates regarding what's going on with the school.
[00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:04.840]   You have to be aware of what's going on.
[00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:07.520]   I wanna get back on track and it feels extremely hard
[00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:09.680]   and sometimes even impossible.
[00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:12.360]   - You know, Jesse, what's interesting about that
[00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:13.480]   is a couple of nights ago,
[00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:15.560]   I was giving a talk up at my kid's school
[00:49:15.560 --> 00:49:19.520]   about smartphones and kids and social media and kids.
[00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:21.520]   And I was talking to a family afterwards
[00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:23.600]   who just moved here from Israel.
[00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:24.920]   And they actually had the same point.
[00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:27.480]   They said, you know, in Israel,
[00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:30.720]   the phone culture is like inescapable.
[00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:33.840]   And they said here, they actually felt like,
[00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:35.200]   so their kid, their middle schooler
[00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:36.040]   had a phone and everything.
[00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:37.800]   He said in Israel, like everything is built around
[00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:40.360]   like WhatsApp notifications and how the schools operate.
[00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:42.080]   And everything is built around the phone
[00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:43.840]   for all these various different reasons.
[00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:45.960]   And here it feels like it's possible not to do that.
[00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:48.040]   And so they were wondering, can we pull it back?
[00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:49.520]   We had that, you know, so it's interesting,
[00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:50.840]   something about Israel.
[00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:53.360]   - Did you read that New Yorker article like last month
[00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:55.680]   about the Chinese school and like all the WhatsApp
[00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:58.440]   and how there's a thousand messages a day for the parents?
[00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:00.080]   - Yeah, I was like completely overwhelmed.
[00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:00.920]   - It's like the same thing.
[00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:02.680]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:04.040]   So I think cultural differences
[00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:05.800]   and tech patterns is an interesting one.
[00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:07.400]   But to get back to the bigger issue here,
[00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:10.080]   I think this goes right back to the question
[00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:12.640]   with the Benedictine monk that we just answered.
[00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:16.240]   So what we see here is kind of the opposite.
[00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:18.640]   So the Benedictine monk, this is basically,
[00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:21.120]   what I mean here is this is sort of,
[00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:22.240]   what's the right way to put this?
[00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:27.240]   Yalan, I believe has done the become a capable person piece
[00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:29.920]   of the deep life stack.
[00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:34.200]   As he talks about, he previously had it all dialed in.
[00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:37.840]   He's organized, he has control over his time
[00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:39.160]   and activities and schedules,
[00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:41.320]   and is careful about how he uses his tools.
[00:50:41.320 --> 00:50:44.360]   But then he stopped before getting to the stuff
[00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:47.920]   that Yitan, the Benedictine monk said is important.
[00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:50.280]   The figuring out your values, your vision for your legacy
[00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:53.280]   and purpose on earth, building your life around that.
[00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:54.840]   So this is a really interesting point
[00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:57.520]   because what it shows is if you just do the first part
[00:50:57.520 --> 00:51:00.080]   in my plan, which is like, you gotta be capable
[00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:01.920]   before you can really figure out how to be deep.
[00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:04.400]   If you just do the capable part,
[00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:06.880]   you don't know that it's gonna stick.
[00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:08.480]   So what happened here, you did the capable part
[00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:11.560]   and your mind was basically like, the what purpose?
[00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:13.920]   And so you began escaping back in the video games
[00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:15.560]   and found sort of the capability stuff
[00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:18.560]   starting to dissipate again.
[00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:22.120]   So Yalan, what you need to do is keep moving up
[00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:24.320]   the deep life stack.
[00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:26.760]   So once you regain, you know how to do this,
[00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:27.840]   so just get back to like, okay,
[00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:29.440]   intentional multi-scale planning,
[00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:31.000]   careful about my tools, great.
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:32.600]   Now you gotta keep moving up the stack.
[00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:35.720]   Now you gotta get really engaged on your values.
[00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:36.800]   What's my code?
[00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:39.280]   What are the rituals I use to remind myself
[00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:42.840]   of the value of this code on a regular basis?
[00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:46.720]   What is this vision on which I'm gonna build my lifestyle,
[00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:48.440]   my purpose on earth?
[00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:50.640]   Maybe then throw in some sacrifice.
[00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:54.080]   If you're not sacrificing non-trivial time and attention
[00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:55.160]   on behalf of other people,
[00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:58.040]   you're not gonna feel fully alive as a human.
[00:51:58.040 --> 00:51:59.720]   So you're a teacher, so there's many ways
[00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:01.840]   for you to reintegrate this into your life.
[00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:03.680]   And then finally, you have this sort of escape
[00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:05.040]   or markability legacy piece
[00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:06.960]   where you have some ambitious plans
[00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:11.560]   that you put into your life that are meant
[00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:14.080]   to actually take these things you care about
[00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:15.400]   and push them to new extremes.
[00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:17.120]   And now you're working towards something,
[00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:19.800]   your capability, your ability to be organized
[00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:21.320]   on top of things is being deployed
[00:52:21.320 --> 00:52:23.040]   towards something that's important to you.
[00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:24.520]   I think that's what's missing.
[00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:26.800]   So in the last question, I said,
[00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:28.560]   if you just do the second part,
[00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:30.480]   but not the first part, that's a problem
[00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:32.400]   because it's very hard to actually seek depth
[00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:35.000]   and sacrifice and have these legacy building projects
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:36.520]   if you're not a capable human.
[00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:38.840]   But we're seeing here is if you just do the first part,
[00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:40.640]   that's not enough either.
[00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:42.680]   You're being productive for the sake of being productive
[00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:44.320]   is eventually gonna probably be something
[00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:45.800]   that is not fulfilling.
[00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:49.880]   So we gotta see both sides of the stack.
[00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:51.400]   Neither of them can act in isolation.
[00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:53.160]   You need both of them.
[00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:56.040]   So Yolan, I'm glad you gave me a chance to talk about that.
[00:52:56.040 --> 00:52:58.640]   All right, so what I wanna do next
[00:52:58.640 --> 00:53:00.640]   is something kind of new.
[00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:02.120]   So we often do case studies on the show
[00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:05.040]   where people send in a written description
[00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:06.920]   of them applying the ideas we talk about
[00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:08.600]   so we can see them in action.
[00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:11.880]   A friend of mine, a magazine editor friend of mine,
[00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:14.760]   however, was telling me about his story
[00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:18.480]   of how he integrated book writing into a busy life,
[00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:20.120]   both professional and personal,
[00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:21.920]   which had a lot of different stuff going on.
[00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:25.200]   And I said, wait a second, let's get you on the air.
[00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:26.720]   Because I think it's a great case study
[00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:29.760]   about integrating ambitious deep projects
[00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:31.040]   into an already busy life.
[00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:33.040]   And it does some myth busting on things
[00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:36.040]   that people worry about and people get wrong.
[00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:37.480]   So my friend, Stuart Reid,
[00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:41.400]   agreed to call in and do a live case study.
[00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:43.200]   So let's do that now.
[00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:46.520]   Let's get Stuart on the line.
[00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:50.200]   All right, Stuart, thank you for jumping on the line
[00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:51.800]   with us today.
[00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:52.800]   Hopefully you're doing well.
[00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:55.160]   It looks like you're in a fancy looking studio there
[00:53:55.160 --> 00:53:57.360]   for those who are watching this instead of just listening.
[00:53:57.360 --> 00:53:59.160]   Why don't you tell us where you are calling in
[00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:00.000]   from right now?
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:02.560]   - I am on the Upper East Side of New York
[00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:04.000]   in the Council on Foreign Relations,
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:06.880]   which is the think tank that the magazine I work for,
[00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:08.080]   Foreign Affairs, is part of.
[00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:10.280]   And I'm deep in the basement,
[00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:11.920]   although there's a projection behind me
[00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:14.480]   to make it seem like I'm on the rooftop.
[00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:18.200]   - So Stuart is classing up the show here.
[00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:20.080]   We're gonna be talking about foreign affairs
[00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:23.040]   and complicated diplomatic wranglings.
[00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:25.400]   So Stuart, the reason why I wanted you to come on
[00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:27.760]   is you have this new book out,
[00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:29.680]   "The Lumumba Plot,
[00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:32.400]   "A Secret History of the CIA in a Cold War Assassination,"
[00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:35.120]   the type of gripping narrative nonfiction book
[00:54:35.120 --> 00:54:36.840]   you might expect the executive editor
[00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:39.680]   of Foreign Affairs to write.
[00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:42.240]   But the reason why I wanted to get you on the line
[00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:45.240]   was not so much the details of the book,
[00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:46.800]   but how you wrote it.
[00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:48.760]   Because you were telling me offline
[00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:50.280]   about the experience you had
[00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:52.840]   figuring out how to make this project work
[00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:54.120]   in an otherwise busy life.
[00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:55.880]   And I thought, "Aha,
[00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:58.800]   "there is an interesting case study lurking here
[00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:01.480]   "about taking on ambitious projects,
[00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:03.200]   "finding time to do the work,
[00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:07.760]   "and some of the paradoxes of what leads to efficiency."
[00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:10.600]   So I wanna just go through a quick timeline here.
[00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:12.320]   This book is coming out in mid-October,
[00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:15.360]   so imminently when this case study is airing.
[00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:18.400]   But take us back to the beginning just to set the stage.
[00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:20.600]   When did the idea of this book emerge
[00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:23.240]   and what was going on in your life at the time?
[00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:25.520]   - Sure, so thanks for having me.
[00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:27.600]   It's so exciting to be here.
[00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:32.200]   The idea was percolating in 2017, 2018.
[00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:34.560]   I focused on Africa, Foreign Affairs,
[00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:37.680]   and thought there was this cool Cold War story
[00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:40.760]   that was front page news in the New York Times at the time,
[00:55:40.760 --> 00:55:42.600]   but was later forgotten.
[00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:45.040]   And so, as you probably know,
[00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:47.280]   the best day in any non-fiction writer's
[00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:52.480]   journey to publication is the day you get the book deal.
[00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:53.880]   And then you realize, "Oh shoot,
[00:55:53.880 --> 00:55:55.600]   "I have to actually figure out how to,
[00:55:55.600 --> 00:55:58.360]   "I'm legally on the hook to turn in
[00:55:58.360 --> 00:56:00.840]   "a certain number of words by a certain date."
[00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:05.840]   And so I had turned in my proposal to my agent
[00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:08.000]   and then I actually got hit by a car
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:10.600]   while biking in Brooklyn,
[00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:14.160]   which would turn out not to be the craziest thing
[00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:15.760]   that happened to me during the whole
[00:56:15.760 --> 00:56:16.840]   book writing experience.
[00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:18.600]   And so that was in January-- - If I could just,
[00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:20.080]   just to interject right there,
[00:56:20.080 --> 00:56:22.400]   I think it would have been to your advantage
[00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:26.160]   to somehow spin that as the forces you talk about
[00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:27.360]   in the book trying to silence you.
[00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:28.200]   You see what I'm doing here?
[00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:30.800]   You could make your own life into a thriller story.
[00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:31.960]   I mean, it's a coincidence, Stuart.
[00:56:31.960 --> 00:56:33.840]   All I'm saying is the day you turn in a book
[00:56:33.840 --> 00:56:35.680]   about the secret history of the CIA,
[00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:38.040]   you mysteriously get hit by a car.
[00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:38.880]   Anyways, go on.
[00:56:38.880 --> 00:56:39.720]   So when was this?
[00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:41.720]   - That was a missed marketing opportunity.
[00:56:41.720 --> 00:56:44.640]   Yeah, I remember sort of sitting in editors' offices
[00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:47.680]   and my tailbone really hurting and trying not to grimace.
[00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:49.400]   That was in January 2019.
[00:56:50.940 --> 00:56:54.020]   I then got married in September of that year
[00:56:54.020 --> 00:56:57.660]   and then went on book leave from Foreign Affairs
[00:56:57.660 --> 00:56:58.940]   for 10 months, the idea being,
[00:56:58.940 --> 00:57:02.820]   oh, you know, an 130,000, 140,000 word book,
[00:57:02.820 --> 00:57:05.020]   you know, I should be able to basically crank that out
[00:57:05.020 --> 00:57:05.860]   in 10 months.
[00:57:05.860 --> 00:57:08.800]   My wife and I moved to Paris
[00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:12.180]   because that seemed like a fun thing to do.
[00:57:12.180 --> 00:57:13.860]   I got a decent amount of research done,
[00:57:13.860 --> 00:57:15.900]   but by the end of that 10 months,
[00:57:15.900 --> 00:57:18.100]   did not have a book at all.
[00:57:18.100 --> 00:57:18.940]   - Right, okay.
[00:57:18.940 --> 00:57:21.060]   So then we have this initial period.
[00:57:21.060 --> 00:57:22.620]   So I'm basically just narrating your life, Stuart.
[00:57:22.620 --> 00:57:25.020]   I hope you don't mind, but this is what I do.
[00:57:25.020 --> 00:57:27.480]   So we have this initial period where you got book leave
[00:57:27.480 --> 00:57:29.020]   and you moved to Paris.
[00:57:29.020 --> 00:57:30.980]   This, I'm just gonna say, is the stand-in
[00:57:30.980 --> 00:57:34.100]   for what people imagine is needed
[00:57:34.100 --> 00:57:36.300]   to successfully tackle a very large
[00:57:36.300 --> 00:57:37.840]   intellectually demanding project.
[00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:41.100]   I need to be able to go somewhere
[00:57:41.100 --> 00:57:44.420]   intellectually stimulating and spend a lot of time
[00:57:44.420 --> 00:57:46.580]   doing nothing but working on this project.
[00:57:46.580 --> 00:57:48.380]   So the first phase of this project
[00:57:48.380 --> 00:57:51.780]   was you doing what people think is needed
[00:57:51.780 --> 00:57:53.580]   to accomplish something of this size,
[00:57:53.580 --> 00:57:55.460]   which is just go away and do nothing but work on the book.
[00:57:55.460 --> 00:57:58.300]   But as you just said, that wasn't enough time.
[00:57:58.300 --> 00:57:59.340]   That didn't work out.
[00:57:59.340 --> 00:58:02.300]   You got research done, but only wrote maybe a third or so
[00:58:02.300 --> 00:58:04.120]   of the book by the time that window was open.
[00:58:04.120 --> 00:58:06.680]   So now suddenly you're in this situation.
[00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:08.700]   We have a lot more book left to write.
[00:58:08.700 --> 00:58:10.420]   The book leave is gone.
[00:58:10.420 --> 00:58:11.460]   All right, so bring the narrative.
[00:58:11.460 --> 00:58:12.460]   I'll bring the narrative back to you
[00:58:12.460 --> 00:58:14.940]   because I think things are about to get even more busier
[00:58:14.940 --> 00:58:16.560]   than they were before.
[00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:17.420]   So now what happens?
[00:58:17.420 --> 00:58:18.940]   You have a lot of book left to write.
[00:58:18.940 --> 00:58:20.260]   The magical book leave in Paris
[00:58:20.260 --> 00:58:22.140]   didn't solve your whole problem.
[00:58:22.140 --> 00:58:23.460]   Now what happens in your life
[00:58:23.460 --> 00:58:25.860]   is you're facing the rest of this manuscript process.
[00:58:25.860 --> 00:58:28.780]   - Sure, and to somewhat complicate the point
[00:58:28.780 --> 00:58:30.440]   you're trying to make, I think it was useful
[00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:33.100]   to be able to think about nothing other than the book.
[00:58:33.100 --> 00:58:35.620]   That was certainly luxury, but you're right.
[00:58:35.620 --> 00:58:38.260]   Then in terms of words cranked out,
[00:58:38.260 --> 00:58:39.780]   it didn't quite cut it.
[00:58:39.780 --> 00:58:43.900]   So then suddenly my day job comes back.
[00:58:43.900 --> 00:58:46.640]   You know, you need healthcare and a salary,
[00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:51.640]   and I'm having to compress the writing process into the day.
[00:58:51.640 --> 00:58:56.560]   So I mean, the key thing that really helped
[00:58:56.560 --> 00:59:00.460]   was taking a page from your work is to time block plan
[00:59:00.460 --> 00:59:03.080]   and specifically to in the mornings,
[00:59:03.080 --> 00:59:06.800]   just protect one, ideally two hours,
[00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:09.860]   first thing in the morning where I'm just writing.
[00:59:09.860 --> 00:59:11.760]   I haven't even opened my email inbox
[00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:13.040]   because the minute I open that,
[00:59:13.040 --> 00:59:15.020]   I see an email, oh, an author's mad or whatever.
[00:59:15.020 --> 00:59:17.220]   Suddenly that's in my brain and I can't concentrate
[00:59:17.220 --> 00:59:19.480]   on the actual task of writing.
[00:59:19.480 --> 00:59:21.800]   - How many mornings a week on average
[00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:23.360]   are we talking at this point?
[00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:25.040]   - Every weekday was the goal.
[00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:28.880]   And you know, you've talked about Jerry Seinfeld's
[00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:33.080]   idea of having an X and a chain of Xs
[00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:35.520]   of every day he's worked, and I really followed that.
[00:59:35.520 --> 00:59:37.420]   And what I think that allowed me to do
[00:59:37.420 --> 00:59:40.960]   is even if I only wrote 50 words
[00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:42.520]   and I was tracking how many words I wrote,
[00:59:42.520 --> 00:59:44.800]   it would still feel like I had to advance the ball
[00:59:44.800 --> 00:59:48.460]   a little bit and contributed to the big project.
[00:59:48.460 --> 00:59:51.880]   Hopefully I'd write 700 words,
[00:59:51.880 --> 00:59:54.720]   but some days I would only get literally 20.
[00:59:54.720 --> 00:59:56.200]   But if I'd written one sentence,
[00:59:56.200 --> 00:59:58.800]   it was like, well, at least I didn't do nothing.
[00:59:58.800 --> 01:00:01.920]   - And how hard was it to protect that time?
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:04.640]   You're an executive editor, which means there's a big,
[01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:06.280]   there's a big amount of responsiveness to your job.
[01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:08.480]   There's also probably a lot of meetings in your job.
[01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:10.920]   So just walk us through what was required
[01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:12.220]   to protect that morning.
[01:00:12.220 --> 01:00:14.080]   Was it as simple as just,
[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:15.520]   I don't schedule meetings first thing,
[01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:17.360]   no one really noticed, or was it more of a battle?
[01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:19.840]   What's the reality of protecting five mornings a week
[01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:20.940]   for one to two hours?
[01:00:20.940 --> 01:00:24.120]   - I would just get up earlier, frankly,
[01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:27.080]   and no email that someone sends you
[01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:29.920]   at from 9 p.m. the night before
[01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:33.040]   needs to be answered at seven rather than 9 a.m.
[01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:37.400]   So just literally putting it on my calendar
[01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:38.720]   so no one could schedule a meeting,
[01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:40.080]   not that people were trying to schedule
[01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:42.180]   7 a.m. meetings with me anyway,
[01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:44.260]   but protecting it that way.
[01:00:44.260 --> 01:00:48.800]   And then, you know, almost like culturally within the house,
[01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:51.420]   just protecting it of like, okay, I'm going to this room,
[01:00:51.420 --> 01:00:53.640]   everyone knows not to bother me.
[01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:57.300]   And then having that time just allowed me
[01:00:57.300 --> 01:01:00.820]   to be purely focused and I had my coffee
[01:01:00.820 --> 01:01:04.100]   and a little ritual, a nice desk, that sort of thing.
[01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:07.680]   And that proved crucial for just really accreting
[01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:09.620]   the number of words I needed to.
[01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:12.020]   - Right, okay, so you're getting up a little earlier,
[01:01:12.020 --> 01:01:14.540]   probably starting your foreign affairs workday
[01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:16.300]   a little bit later than you would have before,
[01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:17.140]   no one noticed.
[01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:19.180]   Because again, no one really keeps track
[01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:22.580]   of exactly when Stuart is answering
[01:01:22.580 --> 01:01:24.220]   his first email of the day.
[01:01:24.220 --> 01:01:25.940]   No one has a chart out of like,
[01:01:25.940 --> 01:01:27.760]   well, what's every meeting time
[01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:29.240]   I've ever suggested to Stuart?
[01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:31.420]   And I can see, wait a second, there's a pattern here.
[01:01:31.420 --> 01:01:33.500]   He never accepts the eight to 8.30s.
[01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:34.980]   I wonder if he's working on something else.
[01:01:34.980 --> 01:01:38.500]   So it basically, you just kept the chain going.
[01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:39.820]   No one really noticed.
[01:01:39.820 --> 01:01:41.100]   Okay, now for a lot of people though,
[01:01:41.100 --> 01:01:44.420]   they're gonna say an hour to two hours max.
[01:01:44.420 --> 01:01:45.660]   That doesn't seem like enough time
[01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:50.660]   to write 150,000 word book or what have you.
[01:01:50.660 --> 01:01:52.940]   But what was your experience in terms of the rate
[01:01:52.940 --> 01:01:56.940]   at which progress accrued during this period?
[01:01:56.940 --> 01:01:59.020]   - Yeah, I mean, slow and steady really works.
[01:01:59.020 --> 01:02:02.100]   There's that John McPhee quote I know you've cited before,
[01:02:02.100 --> 01:02:05.100]   where you add a bunch of drops to a bucket
[01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:07.760]   and all of a sudden the pail's full.
[01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:13.640]   So I'd usually write anywhere from 300 to 700 words a day.
[01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:17.880]   And it really does add up.
[01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:21.560]   I'd supplement this with weekend writing marathon sessions
[01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:24.000]   or I took a vacation where all I did
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.120]   was work on the book for a week.
[01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:29.840]   But it was, most of the book got written
[01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:32.680]   in those early morning sessions.
[01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:34.000]   So it worked.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.360]   - How long would it take you in an early morning session
[01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:40.320]   just to swap in to context?
[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:42.580]   So is it the first five minutes, the first 20 minutes,
[01:02:42.580 --> 01:02:45.520]   how long did it take you to be up and running
[01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:48.400]   and ready to start writing new words?
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:49.240]   - Not that long.
[01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:51.440]   And one trick, I can't remember where I got it,
[01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:56.440]   but is when you're writing to leave
[01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:59.960]   something sort of half finished the day before
[01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:01.600]   so that you have momentum going in.
[01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:06.120]   So that could mean you're writing along
[01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:09.200]   and then you have some notes saying,
[01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:11.120]   add paragraph on blah, blah, blah
[01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:14.280]   and write two sentences where Lumumba
[01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:16.240]   goes to blah, blah, blah meeting or whatever.
[01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:17.240]   And then the next morning,
[01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:18.640]   it's so much easier to start when you're like,
[01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:21.680]   okay, I actually don't have to be fully cognitively present.
[01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:23.680]   I'm just sort of filling in the details
[01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:26.520]   of what I worked on yesterday.
[01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:28.840]   I mean, and another sort of related trick to that
[01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:33.600]   is journalists are familiar with the abbreviation TK,
[01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:35.560]   which stands for to come.
[01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:40.040]   And if you just use a lot of TKs,
[01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:42.960]   you can really get momentum going.
[01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:47.200]   And so, TK quote, and then you write what you know,
[01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:49.600]   and then there were TK number of soldiers in the room,
[01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:50.680]   that sort of thing.
[01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:52.600]   It really allows you to just keep moving forward
[01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:54.960]   and then you can fill in the details later.
[01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:58.620]   - Now, at some point during this post-book leave process,
[01:03:58.620 --> 01:04:00.840]   things got more complicated 'cause you had a child.
[01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:05.080]   So how long into this writing post-book leave writing
[01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:06.120]   was it that you have a child?
[01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:07.840]   And then how did that change up what you were doing?
[01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:09.440]   - It was about a year.
[01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:12.200]   So my daughter was born in September, 2021.
[01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:15.200]   And it was a really crazy,
[01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:17.600]   my wife and I just a very unusual experience
[01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:20.320]   in that our daughter shortly after she was born
[01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:22.720]   started having seizures, had to go to the hospital.
[01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:27.200]   It turns out she has this extremely rare genetic disorder
[01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:32.200]   called STXBP1, which is a neurodevelopmental disorder.
[01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:36.240]   And so that was, when you track the word count,
[01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:41.240]   suddenly there is an abrupt cessation in September, 2021.
[01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:45.560]   And it turned our lives upside down.
[01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:49.080]   I didn't think I'd be able to finish the book,
[01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:50.480]   what would be the point?
[01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:55.480]   And it was a really tough period for us as a family
[01:04:55.480 --> 01:04:57.400]   and this was our first child.
[01:04:57.400 --> 01:05:00.880]   And we were suddenly grappling with
[01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:04.160]   just a very different future than we had imagined.
[01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:06.640]   And so it was, yeah, I mean,
[01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:09.160]   it was the hardest thing I've ever experienced
[01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:10.640]   and hopefully ever will.
[01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:16.480]   - So then what happens after that?
[01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:18.280]   So you get through September is incredibly hard.
[01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:20.160]   Everything comes to a stop.
[01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:22.380]   How does things get going again?
[01:05:22.380 --> 01:05:27.400]   - Yeah, I mean, I think we sort of had to personally,
[01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:31.640]   fully accepting this would be too,
[01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:33.680]   that was a longer process, but just,
[01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:36.880]   you're literally in shock at the beginning
[01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:39.240]   and can barely function.
[01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:41.960]   And so writing a long-term book project
[01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:44.380]   is the furthest thing from one's mind.
[01:05:44.380 --> 01:05:49.800]   But through, I mean, partly just coming to know
[01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:52.280]   our lovely smiling daughter,
[01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:56.000]   and she became more than a diagnosis.
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:00.960]   She became this person with all sorts of cute things.
[01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:04.200]   So there was that process of acceptance.
[01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:08.040]   And then also there was just a sort of sheer willpower
[01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:09.540]   and that I'm very much someone who believes
[01:06:09.540 --> 01:06:12.000]   that you just have to constantly be moving forward.
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:15.780]   And so that means going to the friend's birthday party,
[01:06:15.780 --> 01:06:17.880]   even though you really don't feel like it,
[01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:21.440]   going to exercise,
[01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:24.300]   even if you really just wanna lie in bed all day.
[01:06:24.300 --> 01:06:27.120]   And just through sort of sheer force,
[01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:30.360]   I think we were able to get out of our funk.
[01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:31.840]   And then on the writing side,
[01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:34.160]   that included just returning to the,
[01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:38.740]   okay, I'm gonna do an hour of writing today.
[01:06:38.740 --> 01:06:41.920]   I mean, I just, I remember also,
[01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:43.600]   I had an interview scheduled with someone
[01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:45.640]   and it was like, had been scheduled,
[01:06:45.640 --> 01:06:49.760]   ended up being the day after I got the diagnosis
[01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:51.180]   and I considered canceling,
[01:06:51.180 --> 01:06:53.040]   but I just sort of made myself show up to that.
[01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:56.480]   And I'm sure I was not at my peak performance,
[01:06:56.480 --> 01:07:00.800]   but sort of just forcing yourself to move forward,
[01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:02.800]   faking it till you make it.
[01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:06.520]   I don't know if that's top shelf psychiatric advice,
[01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:07.880]   but it worked for me.
[01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:10.600]   - Well, and there's another, I think, observation
[01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:12.560]   that's important for my listeners,
[01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:16.640]   which is when you're in the moment of working on something
[01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:17.920]   and working on something hard,
[01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:20.200]   it's easy to focus on the short term
[01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:21.460]   and the short term is critical.
[01:07:21.460 --> 01:07:25.880]   And I, you know, no delays are possible,
[01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:29.200]   but from a slow productivity mindset, when you zoom out,
[01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:32.160]   life has all of these different twists and turns
[01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:33.380]   and it throws curve balls.
[01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:35.160]   And there's hard times and good times
[01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:36.840]   and unexpected things that happen
[01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:39.200]   and houses that flood and people that get sick,
[01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:42.640]   which means, hey, I stopped working for a month
[01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:44.040]   or I put this aside for now.
[01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:45.720]   And in the moment, it might seem
[01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:48.760]   this is a disastrous for this project,
[01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:49.960]   but when you zoom back out,
[01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:52.640]   so we zoom back out now, it's 2023,
[01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:55.580]   you've written this great book, the book is out there.
[01:07:55.580 --> 01:07:57.440]   The fact that there's periods
[01:07:57.440 --> 01:07:59.560]   where other things in your life had priority,
[01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:02.920]   that there was periods where that book got put on the shelf,
[01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:06.000]   don't even factor, no one even knows that right now.
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:10.240]   And so this notion of variability in life,
[01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:12.560]   that there's seasons of I'm locked in on this
[01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:14.640]   and seasons where other things are going on,
[01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:16.920]   this notion of really embracing that
[01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:18.800]   and saying in the longterm,
[01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:21.440]   as long as the seasons of stepping away
[01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:22.520]   from something important,
[01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:24.240]   don't turn into lifetimes of that,
[01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:25.860]   so long as when it is appropriate,
[01:08:25.860 --> 01:08:27.680]   you're able to come back to it,
[01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:30.760]   it's not bad for there to be this variability
[01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:32.000]   and effort that are put into it.
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.860]   So I do appreciate that part of your story,
[01:08:34.860 --> 01:08:38.480]   just because I think there's a lot of people in my audience
[01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:41.600]   who have a very hard time with the idea of slowing down
[01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:43.200]   or putting something on the shelf for a while.
[01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:45.600]   It feels somehow like a failure where I see it
[01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:48.640]   as it feels like being a human being.
[01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:50.440]   So you're a great exemplar of that.
[01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:51.640]   And then you came back to the project
[01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:54.240]   when it was appropriate and the project kept going
[01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:55.880]   and now you have this great book.
[01:08:55.880 --> 01:08:58.520]   And it was also very appropriate in September, 2021,
[01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:00.480]   not to be touching that project.
[01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:03.560]   And in the end, this is a slow productivity principle.
[01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:05.540]   It's what you produce on the scale of years,
[01:09:05.540 --> 01:09:09.280]   not on the scale of weeks that ultimately matters.
[01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:12.960]   So anyways, I think it's interesting to punctuate that.
[01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:15.640]   - Yeah, and I think like you've said this before,
[01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:17.240]   but just giving yourself permission
[01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:19.800]   to have a non-productive month
[01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:23.080]   because other stuff's going on is really important.
[01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:26.640]   That like, of course I wasn't gonna be pumping out
[01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:30.680]   10,000 words, the craziest thing ever happened to me.
[01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:33.920]   But then, as you said, in the long scale
[01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:36.640]   of slow productivity, it turns out that's just a blip
[01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:40.480]   and a month over the course of years isn't that much.
[01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:43.120]   - Yeah, okay, so now if we fast forward
[01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:45.800]   past that very difficult fall
[01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:47.600]   and you're falling into a bit of routine
[01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:49.120]   of a family with a child
[01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:52.160]   and not just a family without a child,
[01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:55.720]   how did you find, did this timing still work well,
[01:09:55.720 --> 01:10:00.080]   the like doing things in the morning, was that compatible?
[01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:01.120]   You felt that worked well
[01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:03.160]   because that kept your evenings and afternoons free
[01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:06.600]   for all just the chaos of wrangling children
[01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:08.120]   or was some changes needed
[01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:11.320]   because you're dealing with exotic sleep schedules?
[01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:13.560]   How did things, when they got rolling again,
[01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:16.440]   did it get rolling on this similar schedule?
[01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:18.200]   - It did in a way, I think as anyone
[01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:19.440]   who has young children knows,
[01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:22.000]   you wake up earlier than you did
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.920]   in previous eras in your life.
[01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:26.080]   So I think it actually sort of dovetailed well.
[01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:29.560]   And I mean, I specifically remember a former colleague
[01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:31.360]   of mine who had once written a book
[01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:32.440]   when I was about to write a book,
[01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:33.360]   I said, "Do you have any advice?"
[01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:36.480]   And she said, "Finish the book before you have any children,"
[01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:38.480]   which I utterly failed to follow.
[01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:41.080]   But in a weird way, I think having kids
[01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:43.680]   made me more productive in that it really
[01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:48.480]   fills up your calendar and constrain,
[01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:51.400]   you really can't faff about and waste time
[01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:55.600]   when you have these yapping creatures
[01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:57.400]   who need to be fed and changed.
[01:10:57.400 --> 01:11:01.120]   And so it really, in my case, at least focused the mind
[01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:04.000]   and sort of set the constraints
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.080]   that allowed me to really just get stuff done.
[01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:09.160]   - Right, so you had already learned
[01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:11.080]   prior to having the child that,
[01:11:11.080 --> 01:11:13.880]   "Okay, if I just do a little bit of work every day,
[01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:16.600]   "it builds up and the bucket gets full,"
[01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:18.200]   to use a John McPhee quote.
[01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:22.040]   And that is a work approach that is more compatible
[01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:25.520]   with a full schedule or a crowded schedule,
[01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:26.960]   because it's about just a little bit of time
[01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:28.920]   before things get going, just do that repeatedly.
[01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:31.200]   It's not a schedule that requires
[01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:33.120]   multiple weeks of being left alone.
[01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:35.320]   It's not a schedule that requires
[01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:38.200]   offloading all family responsibilities to someone else
[01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:39.680]   so that you won't be disturbed.
[01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:42.440]   It's about slow and steady.
[01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:44.320]   So you had already discovered that.
[01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:46.760]   So then when the child came along for some,
[01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:49.560]   to some degree, like you were already in the ideal schedule
[01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:51.920]   for a schedule that was gonna be full
[01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:53.440]   of a lot more responsibilities.
[01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:56.800]   So it sounds like you're able to just keep making progress.
[01:11:56.800 --> 01:11:58.160]   What you couldn't have done is if your publisher said,
[01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:00.160]   "Hey, get this done in three weeks."
[01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:02.120]   You say, "Great, I'm just gonna write 12 hours a day
[01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:02.960]   "for three weeks."
[01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:04.280]   That's not gonna be possible.
[01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:08.000]   But slow and steady, you're already
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:09.520]   well configured for that.
[01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:11.680]   - Yeah, I mean, and another thing I should mention
[01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:15.080]   that really helped was you've talked before, Cal,
[01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:16.720]   about sort of the importance of investing
[01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:17.560]   in your own career.
[01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:20.880]   So I took some of my book advance money
[01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:24.760]   plus a grant I received and spent it on research assistance.
[01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:27.680]   I did all the research myself,
[01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:29.200]   but there are certain tasks
[01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:31.160]   that are eminently outsourceable,
[01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:34.680]   like go track down these obscure books at a library
[01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:38.160]   and get me a copy of chapter three of this one, et cetera.
[01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:41.280]   And that cost money,
[01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:46.280]   but it was being able to devolve tasks that didn't...
[01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:50.840]   My highest, best use of time was actually writing the book.
[01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:54.800]   It was not emailing back and forth with an archivist
[01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:57.880]   about could they scan box seven, folder three.
[01:12:57.880 --> 01:13:00.680]   So that was another, I was very fortunate in that respect,
[01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:03.960]   but it helped me focus on writing,
[01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:05.760]   which was the most important thing.
[01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:07.120]   - Well, I think that's a good point.
[01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:09.000]   It's another thing we see often
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:10.720]   and talk about often on the show
[01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:15.240]   that some of the biggest impacts on work schedule
[01:13:15.240 --> 01:13:18.840]   is not the cognitive difficulty of a project.
[01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:22.200]   It's not the raw hours required by a project.
[01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:24.320]   It is sometimes the context shifting.
[01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:28.620]   So what makes a new project a really difficult addition
[01:13:28.620 --> 01:13:29.740]   to a professional schedule,
[01:13:29.740 --> 01:13:31.920]   if it's something that you have to keep turning to
[01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:33.580]   back and forth throughout the day.
[01:13:33.580 --> 01:13:36.480]   So if, for example, like you just said,
[01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:38.920]   if you have to have this back and forth email conversation
[01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:40.120]   going with archivist,
[01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:42.400]   where throughout the day, no, no, it's not that box
[01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:44.560]   and get this, yes, and that here, oh, I'll check it.
[01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:46.200]   If it was something that was requiring you
[01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:48.560]   to shift back to the book project and back to work
[01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:50.680]   and back to the book product and back to your work,
[01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:53.480]   the negative impact of that on your schedule
[01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:57.680]   is greatly amplified versus 90 minutes in the morning
[01:13:57.680 --> 01:13:59.240]   and then it's done.
[01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:01.360]   And again, so I think this is another good point
[01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:04.540]   to emphasize, it's not necessarily the minutes,
[01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:08.220]   it's the context switching that really dictates
[01:14:08.220 --> 01:14:11.260]   how much of an impact a particular pursuit
[01:14:11.260 --> 01:14:12.140]   is gonna have on your schedule.
[01:14:12.140 --> 01:14:15.300]   So I think your investment in minimizing context switching,
[01:14:15.300 --> 01:14:16.460]   you said, I'm gonna invest money
[01:14:16.460 --> 01:14:18.140]   to minimize context switching.
[01:14:18.140 --> 01:14:19.820]   So I can work on this project largely
[01:14:19.820 --> 01:14:22.700]   in single continuous context
[01:14:22.700 --> 01:14:24.060]   was actually a brilliant investment
[01:14:24.060 --> 01:14:26.460]   because that could significantly reduce
[01:14:26.460 --> 01:14:30.460]   the negative impact of this project on your schedule.
[01:14:30.460 --> 01:14:33.560]   Was there anything else you had to do with your other work
[01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:35.080]   so you're able to fit this in in the morning
[01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:38.080]   that didn't actually overlap your normal work schedule?
[01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:39.880]   Having a child probably did more, right?
[01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:44.200]   It's now you can't just easily or casually work later
[01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:46.160]   into the night, et cetera.
[01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:48.400]   Was there any other things you had to do in your work life
[01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:51.760]   as an editor, some efficiencies or structure
[01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:54.560]   to make sure that from the outside world's perspective,
[01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:56.660]   you were still more or less producing the same stuff
[01:14:56.660 --> 01:14:58.720]   you'd always produced at the same level of quality
[01:14:58.720 --> 01:14:59.560]   you had always produced?
[01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:00.960]   What other changes might've been necessary
[01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:02.640]   in this new stage of your life?
[01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:05.040]   - Sure, and I should mention that then my wife and I
[01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:07.840]   had a second child in April,
[01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:12.400]   his birth sort of acted as a deadline
[01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:14.780]   for getting in final edits.
[01:15:14.780 --> 01:15:17.600]   And I was actually marking up proofs in the hospital,
[01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:18.440]   I remember.
[01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:23.640]   But I think I definitely got more efficient
[01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:25.160]   at my day job as well.
[01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:28.680]   I can't point to any particular trick.
[01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:30.760]   I mean, it's the whole bag of tricks
[01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:32.280]   that you talk about all the time,
[01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:36.880]   but only going to meetings that are actually necessary
[01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:41.780]   and where you'll add value, not switching between tasks,
[01:15:41.780 --> 01:15:44.800]   just saying, okay, I need to do a top edit of this article,
[01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:47.100]   I'm gonna work on that for the next 45 minutes
[01:15:47.100 --> 01:15:49.200]   and not check any email, not check Twitter,
[01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:51.800]   not do anything else, just being really disciplined.
[01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:54.380]   And I think knowing that I had this other project
[01:15:54.380 --> 01:15:57.380]   that I also cared about in addition to my work,
[01:15:57.380 --> 01:16:00.120]   made it every minute felt like it counted more.
[01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:04.560]   And so, okay, I need to be on my best behavior here at work
[01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:08.680]   and fully show up and do as great a job as I can
[01:16:08.680 --> 01:16:13.680]   so that I can then use the in between times of the day
[01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:16.640]   to work on this other project.
[01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:18.520]   Yeah.
[01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:19.720]   - So if we had gone back in time
[01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:22.960]   and talked to 2018 version of Stuart,
[01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:25.120]   just in the middle of your workday and said,
[01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:26.240]   hey, here's what we want you to do.
[01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:28.500]   We want you to add two extra hours of work per day.
[01:16:28.500 --> 01:16:30.220]   Oh, and by the way, you can never work late.
[01:16:30.220 --> 01:16:33.580]   Like you have to, when you get to this, whatever, 5.30 time,
[01:16:33.580 --> 01:16:35.220]   you always have to stop.
[01:16:35.220 --> 01:16:36.940]   Hey, is that gonna be a problem?
[01:16:36.940 --> 01:16:39.620]   You probably would have said, well, I'm busy.
[01:16:39.620 --> 01:16:41.500]   I'm filling every minute of my day.
[01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:44.100]   I'm often having to stay a couple hours late
[01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:46.900]   just to catch up on things I'm behind on.
[01:16:46.900 --> 01:16:50.380]   How could I possibly do both of those things?
[01:16:50.380 --> 01:16:53.760]   And yet a few years later, it turns out, oh, I can.
[01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:56.140]   Because work is not just work in a generic sense.
[01:16:56.140 --> 01:16:57.580]   Work is actually a combination
[01:16:57.580 --> 01:16:58.940]   of all sorts of different activities
[01:16:58.940 --> 01:17:01.420]   and switching and sequencing and scheduling and systems.
[01:17:01.420 --> 01:17:04.780]   And it's something that has a lot more knobs to turn
[01:17:04.780 --> 01:17:06.740]   and levers to pull.
[01:17:06.740 --> 01:17:09.020]   So what would be the advice you would give?
[01:17:09.020 --> 01:17:12.140]   Let's say in my audience, there's a 27 year old,
[01:17:12.140 --> 01:17:15.660]   doesn't yet have a family, feels very busy.
[01:17:15.660 --> 01:17:17.420]   They're filling their day.
[01:17:17.420 --> 01:17:19.440]   They're checking email at night.
[01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:21.220]   They have this idea of an important project
[01:17:21.220 --> 01:17:22.300]   that they're well through to pursue,
[01:17:22.300 --> 01:17:24.940]   but say, I just don't see how I can do this
[01:17:24.940 --> 01:17:28.060]   unless I quit my job or had some sort of sabbatical.
[01:17:28.060 --> 01:17:30.260]   Now, based on your experience, 2023,
[01:17:30.260 --> 01:17:32.460]   looking back on how you felt in 2018,
[01:17:32.460 --> 01:17:35.220]   what would your advice be to this hypothetical listener?
[01:17:35.220 --> 01:17:38.700]   - One, this is like super technical,
[01:17:38.700 --> 01:17:43.040]   but I thought I was someone who could not get up early.
[01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:45.680]   And that turns out to have just been a lie
[01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:46.720]   that I told myself.
[01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:50.060]   And so, you actually can get up at 6.15,
[01:17:50.060 --> 01:17:51.300]   just go to bed earlier.
[01:17:51.300 --> 01:17:54.560]   Don't waste time going to bed.
[01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:57.060]   So that's a pretty nitty gritty detail,
[01:17:57.060 --> 01:17:59.340]   but it was totally important
[01:17:59.340 --> 01:18:02.140]   for my being able to get stuff done.
[01:18:02.140 --> 01:18:03.500]   I mean, the other thing also, honestly,
[01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:05.980]   was just locking yourself into a contract.
[01:18:05.980 --> 01:18:10.620]   Nothing stimulates figuring out how to get it done
[01:18:10.620 --> 01:18:13.300]   than being actually on the hook for doing it.
[01:18:13.300 --> 01:18:16.700]   And so, kind of making that leap of faith
[01:18:16.700 --> 01:18:18.140]   and deciding that you're gonna do it
[01:18:18.140 --> 01:18:20.500]   and trusting your future self
[01:18:20.500 --> 01:18:23.220]   to make the changes necessary to work it out,
[01:18:23.220 --> 01:18:24.360]   even if you don't know exactly
[01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:26.460]   how you're gonna rearrange your schedule.
[01:18:26.460 --> 01:18:30.960]   Once you believe that it's probably possible in some way,
[01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:32.960]   you'll figure out the details later.
[01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:34.080]   Try and figure out them now,
[01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:37.440]   but know that you can,
[01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:39.240]   that external force,
[01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:42.000]   the stick of having to deliver
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:45.880]   and the carrot of wanting to publish your own book
[01:18:45.880 --> 01:18:47.560]   or whatever the project is,
[01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:49.800]   the combination of that can actually just
[01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:52.480]   really force you to figure it out.
[01:18:53.380 --> 01:18:54.220]   - I love it.
[01:18:54.220 --> 01:18:57.740]   It's almost a rule we could name here,
[01:18:57.740 --> 01:18:59.580]   like the 90-minute rule.
[01:18:59.580 --> 01:19:02.140]   If you're willing to always protect 90 minutes a day,
[01:19:02.140 --> 01:19:04.900]   first thing in the day, five days a week,
[01:19:04.900 --> 01:19:07.640]   if you zoom out 10 years, 20 years,
[01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:09.900]   the amount of really cool, interesting stuff
[01:19:09.900 --> 01:19:11.180]   that you are able to produce,
[01:19:11.180 --> 01:19:14.180]   the amount of impact you're able to have is massive,
[01:19:14.180 --> 01:19:18.040]   but it all starts with that smaller commitment.
[01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:18.900]   So this is excellent.
[01:19:18.900 --> 01:19:19.820]   So now that you're done,
[01:19:19.820 --> 01:19:21.680]   this book is out or about to come out,
[01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:23.420]   depending on when people listen to this,
[01:19:23.420 --> 01:19:27.380]   the Lumumba plot, which I highly recommend.
[01:19:27.380 --> 01:19:29.180]   What are you gonna do next?
[01:19:29.180 --> 01:19:30.020]   Are you going,
[01:19:30.020 --> 01:19:32.620]   you've learned how to do this with this boarding block.
[01:19:32.620 --> 01:19:33.740]   You can conquer the world.
[01:19:33.740 --> 01:19:34.740]   So what are you thinking about?
[01:19:34.740 --> 01:19:35.980]   - Yeah, that's a great question.
[01:19:35.980 --> 01:19:39.340]   I mean, I have really loved writing a book.
[01:19:39.340 --> 01:19:40.420]   My day job is editing,
[01:19:40.420 --> 01:19:42.340]   working with other authors
[01:19:42.340 --> 01:19:45.860]   and sublimating my own ego in service of them.
[01:19:45.860 --> 01:19:46.900]   And I love that too,
[01:19:46.900 --> 01:19:49.360]   but it was a special treat to be able to,
[01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:52.100]   as you know, just have basically full control
[01:19:52.100 --> 01:19:55.340]   over this extremely long detailed project.
[01:19:55.340 --> 01:19:56.180]   I let, you know,
[01:19:56.180 --> 01:19:58.900]   the paragraph can be exactly the way I want it.
[01:19:58.900 --> 01:20:00.700]   And so that was really rewarding.
[01:20:00.700 --> 01:20:03.600]   So I'd love to do another book,
[01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:06.420]   but on what we'll see.
[01:20:06.420 --> 01:20:07.260]   - Yeah.
[01:20:07.260 --> 01:20:08.820]   And this time just be careful
[01:20:08.820 --> 01:20:11.180]   about suspicious looking drivers,
[01:20:11.180 --> 01:20:14.740]   depending on how inflammatory your topic.
[01:20:14.740 --> 01:20:16.560]   Stuart, I really appreciate you calling in.
[01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:17.940]   I think this was a great case study.
[01:20:17.940 --> 01:20:19.720]   I get these questions all the time from listeners
[01:20:19.720 --> 01:20:22.200]   who are wondering about how to make big projects work
[01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:23.480]   and busy schedules.
[01:20:23.480 --> 01:20:25.040]   You have a busy schedule.
[01:20:25.040 --> 01:20:28.400]   You didn't have heroic interventions
[01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:29.840]   to make this work possible.
[01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:33.200]   It was just slow and steady early in the morning.
[01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:34.240]   So it was a good case study
[01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:35.880]   and I appreciate you sharing it
[01:20:35.880 --> 01:20:38.520]   and everyone check out "The Fruits of This Labor"
[01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:39.800]   which is Stuart's new book,
[01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:41.360]   "The Lumumba Plot",
[01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:43.800]   L-U-M-U-M-B-A.
[01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:44.820]   Thank you, Stuart.
[01:20:44.820 --> 01:20:46.280]   - Thanks so much for having me.
[01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:47.120]   - All right, so that was great.
[01:20:47.120 --> 01:20:48.600]   Thank you, Stuart, for calling in.
[01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:51.960]   I think we all learned a lot from that story.
[01:20:51.960 --> 01:20:54.280]   Before we move on to the third and final segment
[01:20:54.280 --> 01:20:55.120]   of the show today,
[01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:58.160]   I want to briefly mention another one of the sponsors
[01:20:58.160 --> 01:21:01.160]   that makes Deep Questions possible.
[01:21:01.160 --> 01:21:03.040]   This is the time of year for me
[01:21:03.040 --> 01:21:07.120]   where I'm doing events all the time.
[01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:08.160]   Events all the time.
[01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:11.040]   I was giving a talk at my kid's school two nights ago.
[01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:12.880]   Last night I was at my kid's school
[01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:14.760]   for a welcome back dinner.
[01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:17.280]   Tomorrow I'm gonna be at my kid's school
[01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:21.360]   for a ceremony for my third grader.
[01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:25.160]   Then next week I'm giving a panel discussion at Georgetown.
[01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:27.580]   So it's the season where I have long days
[01:21:27.580 --> 01:21:30.160]   where I'm working and doing stuff after work.
[01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:33.360]   So I care about what I'm wearing,
[01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:35.960]   getting clothes that look fine
[01:21:35.960 --> 01:21:38.200]   but are flexible and cool and don't wrinkle
[01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:43.200]   and I can get through very long crowded days in comfort.
[01:21:44.120 --> 01:21:45.960]   This is where Roan enters the scene
[01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:49.640]   and in particular, their new commuter collection,
[01:21:49.640 --> 01:21:50.920]   the most comfortable, breathable
[01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:53.280]   and flexible set of products known to man.
[01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:56.760]   Here's some advantages of the commuter collection.
[01:21:56.760 --> 01:22:00.440]   It's the world's most comfortable pants, dress shirts,
[01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:02.400]   one-fourth zips and polos.
[01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:04.000]   You never have to worry about what to wear
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.400]   if you have a closet full of the commuter collection.
[01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:08.420]   They have this four-way stretch fabric
[01:22:08.420 --> 01:22:10.780]   which provides breathability and flexibility.
[01:22:10.780 --> 01:22:11.620]   I love it.
[01:22:11.620 --> 01:22:13.360]   It's super lightweight and flexible.
[01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:14.240]   I get hot.
[01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:15.080]   You're going all day.
[01:22:15.080 --> 01:22:16.600]   I teach, I'm running around campus
[01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:18.200]   and I come home and jump in the car
[01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:19.080]   and go to give a talk.
[01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:21.540]   Lightweight, flexible, I love.
[01:22:21.540 --> 01:22:24.400]   The Roan commuter collection has that.
[01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:25.880]   It looks good.
[01:22:25.880 --> 01:22:27.560]   It's wrinkle-released so you don't have to worry
[01:22:27.560 --> 01:22:29.440]   about ironing it all the time.
[01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:32.180]   Has gold fusion anti-odor technology.
[01:22:32.180 --> 01:22:34.460]   So you can do a really long day
[01:22:34.460 --> 01:22:37.800]   without feeling like your shirt's gonna start to stink.
[01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:39.560]   It's 100% machine watchable.
[01:22:39.560 --> 01:22:41.520]   Man, I really like this.
[01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:42.960]   Throw it in the washer,
[01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:44.920]   throw it in the dryer on the delegates.
[01:22:44.920 --> 01:22:45.760]   No wrinkle.
[01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:46.800]   You put it right in your closet again.
[01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:48.000]   No dry cleaner.
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:49.160]   So look, if you're like me
[01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:51.200]   and you do a lot of professional stuff
[01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:53.840]   and have to be on stage and talking all the time,
[01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:58.120]   you should consider the Roan commuter collection.
[01:22:58.120 --> 01:23:00.260]   So the commuter collection will get you through any workday
[01:23:00.260 --> 01:23:02.160]   and straight into whatever comes next.
[01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:06.200]   Head to roan.com/cal and use the promo code CAL
[01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:08.800]   and you will save 20% off your entire order.
[01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:11.100]   That's 20% off your entire order
[01:23:11.100 --> 01:23:16.100]   when you head to roan.com/cal and use that code CAL.
[01:23:16.100 --> 01:23:21.560]   It's time to find your corner office comfort.
[01:23:21.560 --> 01:23:26.160]   We also wanna talk about our good friends at Shopify,
[01:23:26.160 --> 01:23:29.000]   the commerce platform that is revolutionizing
[01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:32.880]   millions of businesses worldwide.
[01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:35.720]   If there's something you wanna sell online,
[01:23:35.720 --> 01:23:38.540]   you should be using Shopify.
[01:23:39.720 --> 01:23:41.660]   They put you in control of every sales channel.
[01:23:41.660 --> 01:23:44.300]   So whether you're selling satin sheets,
[01:23:44.300 --> 01:23:47.060]   sheets, not sheeps, I guess you could sell sheeps,
[01:23:47.060 --> 01:23:50.060]   from Shopify's in-person POS system
[01:23:50.060 --> 01:23:52.020]   or offering organic olive oil
[01:23:52.020 --> 01:23:54.580]   on Shopify's all-in-one e-commerce platform,
[01:23:54.580 --> 01:23:56.920]   you are covered.
[01:23:56.920 --> 01:23:58.100]   And once you've reached your audience,
[01:23:58.100 --> 01:24:00.300]   Shopify has the internet's best converting checkout
[01:24:00.300 --> 01:24:02.740]   to help you turn them from browsers to buyers.
[01:24:02.740 --> 01:24:05.020]   You have probably used Shopify technology
[01:24:05.020 --> 01:24:06.700]   multiple times buying things online.
[01:24:06.700 --> 01:24:08.000]   You just don't realize it.
[01:24:09.180 --> 01:24:10.940]   If you've ever had a really nice experience
[01:24:10.940 --> 01:24:12.220]   and you think, "Wow, this website
[01:24:12.220 --> 01:24:13.620]   really has a great shopping experience.
[01:24:13.620 --> 01:24:15.700]   It knew my information, it filled it all in,
[01:24:15.700 --> 01:24:16.700]   it was easy to do,"
[01:24:16.700 --> 01:24:18.400]   then we're probably using Shopify.
[01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:20.660]   So Jesse, when we figure out
[01:24:20.660 --> 01:24:23.940]   our Jesse Skeleton merchandising strategy,
[01:24:23.940 --> 01:24:27.780]   Shopify is gonna be how we reach our masses.
[01:24:27.780 --> 01:24:31.180]   I mean, we need a platform capable of handling
[01:24:31.180 --> 01:24:33.460]   tens of millions of dollars
[01:24:33.460 --> 01:24:35.260]   of Jesse Skeleton-related orders.
[01:24:35.260 --> 01:24:36.100]   - Yeah.
[01:24:36.100 --> 01:24:36.940]   - I mean, I'm thinking like--
[01:24:36.940 --> 01:24:38.100]   - Seamless checkout process.
[01:24:38.100 --> 01:24:41.380]   - Seamless checkout process, direct ship,
[01:24:41.380 --> 01:24:43.780]   you get your Jesse Skeleton animatronic,
[01:24:43.780 --> 01:24:45.700]   you set it up wherever you work,
[01:24:45.700 --> 01:24:48.840]   and it just sort of at sporadic points during the day
[01:24:48.840 --> 01:24:53.620]   begins moving and motivates you.
[01:24:53.620 --> 01:24:54.500]   I think that'd be a good product.
[01:24:54.500 --> 01:24:55.340]   - Yeah.
[01:24:55.340 --> 01:24:56.500]   Doesn't need to get off your phone.
[01:24:56.500 --> 01:24:57.580]   - Yeah.
[01:24:57.580 --> 01:25:00.620]   Hey, you should, as the arms are moving,
[01:25:00.620 --> 01:25:02.060]   like little animatronic motors,
[01:25:02.060 --> 01:25:03.540]   you should get off your phone.
[01:25:03.540 --> 01:25:04.380]   (Jesse laughs)
[01:25:04.380 --> 01:25:06.300]   (Jesse hums)
[01:25:06.300 --> 01:25:07.420]   And then it goes back quiet again.
[01:25:07.420 --> 01:25:08.740]   I mean, come on, people would buy that.
[01:25:08.740 --> 01:25:09.580]   - Yeah.
[01:25:09.580 --> 01:25:10.400]   - Yeah.
[01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:15.220]   All for just 7.99, 99, 99.
[01:25:15.220 --> 01:25:16.220]   - On a Shopify site.
[01:25:16.220 --> 01:25:17.220]   - On a Shopify site.
[01:25:17.220 --> 01:25:21.260]   But if we were selling something, we would use Shopify.
[01:25:21.260 --> 01:25:23.740]   The people I know who use it absolutely love it.
[01:25:23.740 --> 01:25:27.940]   It powers now 10% of all e-commerce in the US.
[01:25:27.940 --> 01:25:29.460]   They're also a truly global force.
[01:25:29.460 --> 01:25:31.660]   They power Allbirds, Rothy's, Brooklinens,
[01:25:31.660 --> 01:25:36.180]   and soon jesseskeleton.com.

[01:25:59.020 --> 01:26:01.340]   Jesse, I want our jesseskeleton product,
[01:26:01.340 --> 01:26:04.020]   and this is what's really gonna make it a top seller.
[01:26:04.020 --> 01:26:06.140]   Right before it sporadically and unpredictably
[01:26:06.140 --> 01:26:07.980]   starts moving and telling you to get off your phone
[01:26:07.980 --> 01:26:09.020]   and work harder,
[01:26:09.020 --> 01:26:13.180]   I'm thinking incredibly loud klaxon horn sound.
[01:26:13.180 --> 01:26:14.060]   So like get your attention.
[01:26:14.060 --> 01:26:16.500]   So you're working and then just,
[01:26:16.500 --> 01:26:20.180]   (imitates horn honking)
[01:26:20.180 --> 01:26:22.180]   really loud motors, and then it's,
[01:26:22.180 --> 01:26:25.500]   are you working the klaxon?
[01:26:25.500 --> 01:26:26.340]   That's how you know.
[01:26:26.340 --> 01:26:30.180]   And then other people in nearby buildings will ask,
[01:26:30.180 --> 01:26:32.340]   what is that really loud, alarming klaxon sound
[01:26:32.340 --> 01:26:34.820]   they keep hearing every seven to eight minutes?
[01:26:34.820 --> 01:26:36.460]   And you'll say, it's my jesseskeleton.
[01:26:36.460 --> 01:26:38.060]   And they'll say, well, where can I get one?
[01:26:38.060 --> 01:26:39.820]   You'll say online at jesseskeleton.com.
[01:26:39.820 --> 01:26:41.740]   They're like, yeah, but it's gonna be
[01:26:41.740 --> 01:26:43.860]   like a really clunky, difficult e-commerce experience,
[01:26:43.860 --> 01:26:44.700]   so forget about it.
[01:26:44.700 --> 01:26:45.980]   And you're like, no, no, no.
[01:26:45.980 --> 01:26:47.660]   It's powered by Shopify.
[01:26:47.660 --> 01:26:48.960]   And they're gonna buy one.
[01:26:48.960 --> 01:26:51.100]   Got it all figured out.
[01:26:51.100 --> 01:26:53.160]   Oh man.
[01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:54.500]   All right.
[01:26:54.500 --> 01:26:55.340]   We got time.
[01:26:55.340 --> 01:26:57.700]   We used to do a third segment on this show
[01:26:57.700 --> 01:26:59.400]   once we're done with the nonsense,
[01:27:00.460 --> 01:27:03.180]   where we just like to do something interesting or different.
[01:27:03.180 --> 01:27:04.660]   So in our final segment today, Jesse,
[01:27:04.660 --> 01:27:05.580]   I just wanted to talk about,
[01:27:05.580 --> 01:27:09.000]   I wanted to react to an article that I read online
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:10.400]   that captured my attention,
[01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:13.600]   'cause I think there's a couple interesting lessons in here
[01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:18.220]   about our ongoing interest to embrace slow productivity.
[01:27:18.220 --> 01:27:20.100]   I'll load this article up on the screen
[01:27:20.100 --> 01:27:22.180]   for those who are watching.
[01:27:22.180 --> 01:27:23.380]   If you're listening to the podcast,
[01:27:23.380 --> 01:27:25.740]   remember, go to thedeeplife.com/listen.
[01:27:25.740 --> 01:27:27.500]   This is episode 267,
[01:27:27.500 --> 01:27:30.340]   and you can find the videos right there on the episode page.
[01:27:30.340 --> 01:27:31.420]   All right, so this article came
[01:27:31.420 --> 01:27:36.220]   from the New York Times Magazine, I believe, September 9th.
[01:27:36.220 --> 01:27:39.100]   The title is "How Lauren Groff,
[01:27:39.100 --> 01:27:43.920]   one of our finest living writers, does her work."
[01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:46.960]   So I love these knowledge worker,
[01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:48.780]   elite knowledge worker case studies.
[01:27:48.780 --> 01:27:50.860]   So we get some insight into how
[01:27:50.860 --> 01:27:54.020]   really high cognitive performers do their work.
[01:27:54.020 --> 01:27:55.620]   How do we know she's one of the finest living writers?
[01:27:55.620 --> 01:27:56.740]   Well, we see right off the bat
[01:27:56.740 --> 01:28:00.500]   that she is a three-time National Book Award finalist.
[01:28:00.500 --> 01:28:02.700]   Basically, the last three books she has written
[01:28:02.700 --> 01:28:04.860]   were National Book Award finalists.
[01:28:04.860 --> 01:28:08.300]   Probably her new book, "Devastator Wilds," will be as well.
[01:28:08.300 --> 01:28:10.440]   So I just wanna point out a couple,
[01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:12.620]   I marked a couple insights from this article.
[01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:14.900]   I just wanna briefly underscore,
[01:28:14.900 --> 01:28:16.340]   and then we'll talk about it.
[01:28:16.340 --> 01:28:20.500]   Okay, so she has three New York Times bestsellers.
[01:28:20.500 --> 01:28:24.960]   She is unusually productive for a literary writer.
[01:28:26.040 --> 01:28:28.940]   So her new book, "Devastator Wilds,"
[01:28:28.940 --> 01:28:33.220]   is coming out exactly two years after her last book, "Matrix,"
[01:28:33.220 --> 01:28:35.000]   which itself came out just three years
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.460]   after her book before that, "Florida."
[01:28:37.460 --> 01:28:40.620]   This is a very fast pace for literary writers.
[01:28:40.620 --> 01:28:41.940]   As she goes on to say,
[01:28:41.940 --> 01:28:45.220]   "It takes about five years to write a book of this caliber."
[01:28:45.220 --> 01:28:47.340]   So how is she doing it so fast?
[01:28:47.340 --> 01:28:49.900]   She's interleaving the writing process.
[01:28:49.900 --> 01:28:52.500]   So that's the next thing I wanna talk about here.
[01:28:52.500 --> 01:28:55.540]   She's able to keep up her publishing pace
[01:28:55.540 --> 01:28:56.920]   by working on several projects,
[01:28:56.920 --> 01:29:00.040]   even several novels simultaneously,
[01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:04.120]   holding vibrant, distinct worlds distinct in her mind.
[01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:07.880]   To help do that, she has these different projects
[01:29:07.880 --> 01:29:11.540]   live in different corners of her office.
[01:29:11.540 --> 01:29:14.400]   So she works in different spaces of her office
[01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:16.140]   on different books.
[01:29:16.140 --> 01:29:19.440]   So there's her desk.
[01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:23.320]   She also has a different wooden desk, a different end of it.
[01:29:23.320 --> 01:29:26.300]   She has a day bed, so different projects exist
[01:29:26.300 --> 01:29:28.260]   in different spaces.
[01:29:28.260 --> 01:29:29.740]   All right, so once she's working on a book,
[01:29:29.740 --> 01:29:30.920]   how does she actually do it?
[01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:33.800]   I thought this was crazy and fascinating.
[01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:35.600]   When Groff starts something new,
[01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:39.440]   she writes it out longhand in large spiral notebooks.
[01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:41.040]   After she completes the first draft,
[01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:44.900]   she puts it in a banker's box and never reads it again.
[01:29:44.900 --> 01:29:49.000]   So her method is, I'm gonna write an entire draft
[01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.480]   of a book slowly and deliberately longhand
[01:29:51.480 --> 01:29:52.820]   and never look at it again.
[01:29:53.660 --> 01:29:55.380]   'Cause what she's figured out is to write
[01:29:55.380 --> 01:29:57.580]   at a very high level literary fiction,
[01:29:57.580 --> 01:30:01.500]   the ideas matter, defining those ideas,
[01:30:01.500 --> 01:30:03.420]   those characterizations, those plot points
[01:30:03.420 --> 01:30:05.400]   to just hit the right buttons or everything.
[01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:07.940]   So she figures if she writes a whole book
[01:30:07.940 --> 01:30:09.440]   and never looks at it again,
[01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:12.580]   the stuff that sticks is the good stuff.
[01:30:12.580 --> 01:30:14.800]   So then when she comes to write another draft of the book,
[01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:17.240]   what's gonna come back to her from that initial draft,
[01:30:17.240 --> 01:30:18.640]   if she can't actually go back and read it,
[01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:20.780]   is gonna be the stuff that's stuck.
[01:30:20.780 --> 01:30:22.580]   And what is it makes a great book great
[01:30:22.580 --> 01:30:25.620]   is all these scenes that stick with you after you've read it.
[01:30:25.620 --> 01:30:28.820]   So she's found a way to efficiently filter
[01:30:28.820 --> 01:30:33.300]   for this literary magic by actually writing something
[01:30:33.300 --> 01:30:34.740]   and then seeing what sticks with her
[01:30:34.740 --> 01:30:37.200]   without having to actually go back and look at it.
[01:30:37.200 --> 01:30:39.940]   She calls these lightning bolts,
[01:30:39.940 --> 01:30:41.540]   I'll put this quote here,
[01:30:41.540 --> 01:30:45.100]   "Nothing matters except for these lightning bolts
[01:30:45.100 --> 01:30:46.300]   "that I've discovered."
[01:30:46.300 --> 01:30:49.100]   So she's going back and forth between books.
[01:30:49.100 --> 01:30:51.540]   She has this method of how to do it.
[01:30:51.540 --> 01:30:55.300]   Later in the article, they also talk about her timing.
[01:30:55.300 --> 01:30:58.540]   Like a lot of writers of this caliber,
[01:30:58.540 --> 01:31:00.340]   she wakes up and I'll quote here,
[01:31:00.340 --> 01:31:03.860]   "At 5 a.m. and disappears into a writing for hours
[01:31:03.860 --> 01:31:07.060]   "without having to manage the routine
[01:31:07.060 --> 01:31:08.660]   "of getting her two children fed and out the door."
[01:31:08.660 --> 01:31:10.580]   So she has an agreement.
[01:31:10.580 --> 01:31:13.180]   She has that worked out with her husband
[01:31:13.180 --> 01:31:15.160]   that she can start writing in the morning.
[01:31:15.160 --> 01:31:18.320]   Then she stops writing early afternoon, according to this.
[01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:20.380]   And then the afternoon is more for the business side
[01:31:20.380 --> 01:31:22.180]   of writing, the publicity, et cetera,
[01:31:22.180 --> 01:31:23.740]   taking back over responsibility of the kids.
[01:31:23.740 --> 01:31:25.380]   So she also has a very strict schedule
[01:31:25.380 --> 01:31:27.780]   of just you do this writing morning
[01:31:27.780 --> 01:31:30.780]   to a certain point in time, and then you're done with it.
[01:31:30.780 --> 01:31:32.860]   All right, so I wanna draw a couple
[01:31:32.860 --> 01:31:35.140]   slow productivity observations from this.
[01:31:35.140 --> 01:31:37.100]   This is an incredibly successful writer.
[01:31:37.100 --> 01:31:39.620]   What she did is figured out what's needed
[01:31:39.620 --> 01:31:42.040]   to produce a National Book Award finalist.
[01:31:42.040 --> 01:31:45.260]   If anyone has cracked this code, it is Lauren Groff.
[01:31:45.260 --> 01:31:47.660]   She's done it three times in a row, probably four.
[01:31:47.660 --> 01:31:50.380]   We'll see how her new book does.
[01:31:50.380 --> 01:31:53.120]   So you realize like, okay, it's all about, it's craft,
[01:31:53.120 --> 01:31:55.260]   but it's also about these lightning bolts, as she call it,
[01:31:55.260 --> 01:31:56.740]   having these sort of brilliant moments
[01:31:56.740 --> 01:31:58.340]   of characterization and plot.
[01:31:58.340 --> 01:31:59.280]   So here's the process.
[01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:00.860]   You gotta write a whole book longhand
[01:32:00.860 --> 01:32:02.020]   and basically throw it out,
[01:32:02.020 --> 01:32:04.340]   then write a second draft longhand and see what sticks.
[01:32:04.340 --> 01:32:07.580]   And then only then deliberately
[01:32:07.580 --> 01:32:09.900]   and relentlessly starts transforming that
[01:32:09.900 --> 01:32:12.740]   into a typed up manuscript that you're very carefully
[01:32:12.740 --> 01:32:14.740]   polishing and tweaking and trying to get it just right.
[01:32:14.740 --> 01:32:16.660]   And it takes five years.
[01:32:16.660 --> 01:32:18.700]   And it takes five years and you need plenty of time
[01:32:18.700 --> 01:32:20.060]   in between these things.
[01:32:20.060 --> 01:32:21.580]   And so if I wanna write a book more than once
[01:32:21.580 --> 01:32:22.620]   every five years, then great.
[01:32:22.620 --> 01:32:25.420]   How can I interleave two or three of these at the same time?
[01:32:25.420 --> 01:32:26.260]   Well, I can do it.
[01:32:26.260 --> 01:32:28.260]   I know when I can switch from one to another
[01:32:28.260 --> 01:32:29.340]   and I'll use different spaces
[01:32:29.340 --> 01:32:31.060]   so I don't have confused cognitive context.
[01:32:31.060 --> 01:32:33.940]   And I'll just deliberately work four or five hours a day.
[01:32:33.940 --> 01:32:36.300]   And she has did the math and it works.
[01:32:36.300 --> 01:32:38.180]   Slow but steady.
[01:32:38.180 --> 01:32:39.260]   Here's what I do.
[01:32:39.260 --> 01:32:40.340]   Here's how I do it.
[01:32:40.340 --> 01:32:41.280]   This is what matters.
[01:32:41.280 --> 01:32:43.540]   Don't spend stuff on time that doesn't matter.
[01:32:43.540 --> 01:32:45.140]   Super long hours aren't needed.
[01:32:46.040 --> 01:32:47.780]   I don't need to have no kids.
[01:32:47.780 --> 01:32:49.980]   I don't need to never have any childcare responsibilities.
[01:32:49.980 --> 01:32:53.220]   I just need to be able to have four to five hours a day
[01:32:53.220 --> 01:32:55.860]   and do the right thing during those four to five hours a day
[01:32:55.860 --> 01:32:56.940]   and only do those things
[01:32:56.940 --> 01:32:58.700]   during those four to five hours a day.
[01:32:58.700 --> 01:33:01.020]   And then add in the secret ingredient of time.
[01:33:01.020 --> 01:33:02.360]   You add up enough days.
[01:33:02.360 --> 01:33:03.500]   This is the John McPhee quote.
[01:33:03.500 --> 01:33:04.780]   You put enough drops in a bucket,
[01:33:04.780 --> 01:33:07.120]   it eventually ends up full.
[01:33:07.120 --> 01:33:10.440]   You spend enough four hours, days focusing on
[01:33:10.440 --> 01:33:12.300]   not just writing, but the writing activities
[01:33:12.300 --> 01:33:14.260]   that make the difference.
[01:33:14.260 --> 01:33:15.840]   And you patiently build up over time.
[01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:17.500]   One of the most impressive writing careers,
[01:33:17.500 --> 01:33:20.480]   I would say, of the 21st century so far.
[01:33:20.480 --> 01:33:24.740]   So as I thought, Lauren was a great case study
[01:33:24.740 --> 01:33:27.820]   of slow productivity in action.
[01:33:27.820 --> 01:33:29.600]   Focus on what matters.
[01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:31.800]   Work steadily, but a reasonable amount.
[01:33:31.800 --> 01:33:34.840]   Let time and aggregation do more work than freneticism
[01:33:34.840 --> 01:33:37.620]   and exhausting overwork in the moment.
[01:33:37.620 --> 01:33:39.860]   And really cool stuff can come out of it.
[01:33:39.860 --> 01:33:41.640]   You know, I also like Jessie.
[01:33:41.640 --> 01:33:43.780]   She's summers, New Hampshire.
[01:33:43.780 --> 01:33:44.620]   - Oh yeah.
[01:33:44.620 --> 01:33:46.580]   - Right, she's got it dialed in.
[01:33:46.580 --> 01:33:48.540]   Live in New Hampshire in the summer.
[01:33:48.540 --> 01:33:49.860]   And she's in Florida the rest of the year.
[01:33:49.860 --> 01:33:51.700]   But live in New Hampshire in the summer, I like it.
[01:33:51.700 --> 01:33:53.040]   That's the secret.
[01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:54.840]   She does a lot of physical activity.
[01:33:54.840 --> 01:33:58.260]   Her and her husband were both athletes.
[01:33:58.260 --> 01:34:00.640]   They're also, she sees it as like she's lots of running
[01:34:00.640 --> 01:34:02.620]   and I think he was a rower.
[01:34:02.620 --> 01:34:04.660]   So a lot of like being really good shape
[01:34:04.660 --> 01:34:05.700]   and spend a lot of time outdoors
[01:34:05.700 --> 01:34:08.700]   and write four hours every morning and it just works.
[01:34:08.700 --> 01:34:09.540]   She's got it dialed in.
[01:34:09.540 --> 01:34:10.960]   Slow productivity everyone.
[01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:12.420]   That's the secret.
[01:34:12.420 --> 01:34:15.420]   Not freneticism or busyness or keeping options open
[01:34:15.420 --> 01:34:17.100]   or I don't know, whatever the other stuff we talk about.
[01:34:17.100 --> 01:34:20.000]   So if only someone would write a book on slow productivity
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.460]   that we could collapse, collect all these insights.
[01:34:22.460 --> 01:34:24.700]   If only let's say in March,
[01:34:24.700 --> 01:34:27.680]   there was a book coming out about slow productivity.
[01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:29.560]   If there was, I would just say everyone should buy it,
[01:34:29.560 --> 01:34:30.940]   but you know, we'll have to wait and see.
[01:34:30.940 --> 01:34:32.300]   All right, enough nonsense.
[01:34:32.300 --> 01:34:37.380]   Quick reminder, you like the show, leave a review.
[01:34:37.380 --> 01:34:38.560]   It does help.
[01:34:38.560 --> 01:34:40.020]   Consider subscribing.
[01:34:40.020 --> 01:34:42.160]   It also helps, helps people find it.
[01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:43.900]   So, you know, I read the reviews
[01:34:43.900 --> 01:34:46.700]   and I really appreciate them.
[01:34:46.700 --> 01:34:47.620]   Otherwise, thanks for listening.
[01:34:47.620 --> 01:34:50.940]   We'll be back next week with another episode of the show.
[01:34:50.940 --> 01:34:53.400]   And until then, as always, stay deep.
[01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:57.180]   Hey, so if you liked today's episode about tiredness,
[01:34:57.180 --> 01:35:00.660]   I think you'll also like episode 248
[01:35:00.660 --> 01:35:03.820]   about decoding overload.
[01:35:03.820 --> 01:35:04.660]   Check it out.
[01:35:04.660 --> 01:35:07.300]   As you get more stuff on your plate,
[01:35:07.300 --> 01:35:10.220]   the cost of that seems to grow much faster
[01:35:10.220 --> 01:35:11.620]   than the amount of work you're adding.
