[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.980]   - Welcome to episode number four
[00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.720]   of the Bogleheads Life Stages Podcast.
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.280]   Bogleheads are investors who follow
[00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.080]   John Bogle's investing philosophy
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.800]   for attaining financial independence.
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.080]   Today's episode features Jim Richmond,
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.040]   designer of the Flexible Retirement Planner.
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.920]   This recording was made on March 24th, 2021.
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.560]   Nothing in this video should be construed
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.800]   as personalized investment advice.
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.640]   - Oh, well, you know, what about retirement?
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.440]   What about, you know, how much do I need to have saved?
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.520]   And I started looking around and I put the,
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.160]   I wanted something that had implemented variable withdrawal.
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.880]   I was looking for a calculator online
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.800]   that had just some sort of decision rule.
[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.320]   I had read some recent paper, there's, I think, Goitin,
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.880]   Jonathan Goitin had written about how to kind of,
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.360]   you could get a slightly higher withdrawal rate
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.040]   with a good probability of success
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.560]   if you have some decision rule in the withdrawal process
[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.240]   that adjusts the withdrawal
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.360]   based on how well the plan is going.
[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.720]   So if you have a bad sequence of returns,
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.680]   you could maybe cut back spending a little bit.
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.080]   And if you allow that in the model,
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.960]   you end up with a higher withdrawal rate supported
[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.960]   for a given probability of success
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.520]   or a given success rate for the retirement plan.
[00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.720]   So anyhow, I couldn't find that calculator.
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.800]   So I decided to put this one together
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.920]   and initially just did it on a whim,
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.480]   but I posted it to the web
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.120]   and did get some positive feedback about it.
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.600]   And after six months or a year,
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.720]   I decided to turn it into a business and have done it.
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.240]   Okay, so right now you should be seeing,
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.960]   or within a few minutes, seconds,
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.400]   you'll be seeing the main page
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.200]   for the Flexible Retirement Planner.
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.200]   And this is what you get if you hit New Plan
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.800]   up in the top left.
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.200]   It resets all the inputs to their defaults.
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.280]   Let me see if I can.
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:14.000]   And the inputs to the planner
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.960]   should be relatively straightforward.
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.080]   Current age, retirement age, life expectancy.
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.520]   For this demo, I'm gonna start out,
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.640]   we'll assume the retiree is 40 years old.
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.600]   The person using the planner.
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.440]   And the retirement age, 65,
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.920]   and the life expectancy, 95.
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.440]   We'll say 3% for inflation.
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.680]   We'll leave it at the default.
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.840]   These income tax and investment tax rates
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.200]   should include state tax and federal tax,
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.240]   any local income tax if it's paid.
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.080]   And then for portfolio value,
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.280]   we're gonna say that there's currently a $300,000,
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.240]   let me make sure I get that,
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.320]   $300,000 tax-deferred portfolio.
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.640]   By the way, this min IRA 401(k) withdrawal age
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.800]   trips people up sometimes.
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.000]   I'm actually, in the next release,
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.360]   gonna move that into settings
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.760]   just 'cause it gets in the way.
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.320]   Basically, that's the minimum penalty-free
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.280]   IRA 401(k) withdrawal age.
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.520]   So most people never need to touch that.
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.480]   And that's part of why I'm gonna move it to settings.
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.040]   So just so you don't get tripped up on that.
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.600]   And then I'm gonna say that for this plan,
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.400]   this person, this 40-year-old,
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.480]   is gonna put $15,000 away every year
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.960]   in their tax-deferred annual savings.
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.680]   And then the other inputs, we have investing styles,
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.960]   and I'll just leave it at the default.
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.000]   These are sort of canned portfolios
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.520]   that have given this investment mix.
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.320]   I strongly suggest folks take a look
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.600]   at the Simba's back-testing spreadsheet.
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.560]   That's a great resource for figuring out
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.560]   for your own portfolio what's a good return
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.880]   and standard deviation to use.
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.320]   But you could use these canned ones at least to get started.
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.480]   By the way, I guess I should do the standard disclaimer.
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.760]   I'm not a financial planner,
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.840]   and I'm not an investment expert.
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.720]   So nothing I say should be interpreted as investing advice
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.160]   or financial planning advice.
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.800]   I do know about the tool,
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.720]   and I'm happy to answer questions about, of course,
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.560]   how to model things that you'd like to model
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.920]   in your financial plan.
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.480]   But I can't provide any kind of help
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.240]   or advice on the financial planning side.
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.360]   Next, we come down to retirement income.
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.840]   And in this case, we'll say that there's gonna be
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.360]   a $25,000 annual retirement income.
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.880]   Let's say it's a couple, and they're both the same age,
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.520]   and they're gonna start at age 67,
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.280]   withdrawing from that Social Security
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.720]   or taking that Social Security income.
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.720]   Retirement spending is 50,000.
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.440]   And this spending policy is, again,
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.400]   that decision rule that I talked about.
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.720]   And I'll get into the details of this later,
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.760]   but we'll leave it at the default for now.
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:59.920]   And then we'll hit run.
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:04.440]   And so what we see with this set of inputs,
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.640]   we have a fairly robust plan.
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.040]   On the left, you see the graph,
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:13.040]   which the purplish bars are the tax-deferred portfolio.
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:17.240]   The blue bars are the taxable portfolio.
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.240]   And the reason that we're seeing this changeover
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.200]   from tax-deferred to taxable
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:25.720]   is that RMDs are kicking in automatically at age 72.
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.640]   And so that's why we're seeing
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.560]   the tax-deferred portfolio decreasing.
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.280]   On the right-hand side,
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.720]   we can see the probability of success is 99%.
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.160]   We run 10,000 paths through the retirement.
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:45.520]   So basically, that's gonna draw 10,000 different,
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.240]   unique, random sequences of return.
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.000]   And based on those sequences of return that we draw,
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.720]   one for each year of the retirement plan,
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:57.320]   we're gonna have a varying result.
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:58.240]   And so in this case,
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.480]   we ran 10,000 paths through the plan,
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:05.200]   and we had probably between 50 and 100 failures
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.200]   to get a 99% probability of success.
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:14.360]   And the average spending shortfall is 16%.
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.440]   And that's really just a metric.
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:22.440]   I think it was Masha Malevsky had some research
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.680]   that was basically wanting to try to quantify
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:29.200]   when the plans fail in a Monte Carlo simulation,
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.280]   how bad is it?
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:35.040]   Is there a way to tell plans that fail earlier
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.840]   versus plans that fail later?
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.280]   And spending shortfall tries to do that
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.960]   so that if you had two different retirement plans
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.560]   with two different sets of inputs,
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.640]   and they were both showing a 90% probability of success,
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.400]   one still may be more robust than another
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.800]   if it turns out that the failures happen earlier
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.000]   in the plan for one compared to the other.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.800]   And that's what's average spending shortfall.
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.480]   It says just looking only at the failures,
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.400]   how much of the spending that was intended to happen
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.000]   in that plan got a chance to happen
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.280]   before the portfolio ran out of money.
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:10.920]   And so with this 16%, that means 85 on average,
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.720]   even with the failed plans,
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.400]   they made it 85% of the way through the retirement
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.280]   before the portfolio ran out of money.
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:20.120]   And again, we're only talking about 50 or so failures here
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.800]   given the 99% probability of success.
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.640]   But for those 50 failures,
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:28.400]   even they made it about 85% of the way through retirement.
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:31.080]   That's what the spending shortfall is telling you.
[00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:32.720]   The other thing I wanna talk about here,
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.920]   the initial portfolio value.
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.760]   The other values are median values.
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:40.280]   So portfolio value at retirement is 1.5 million,
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:43.720]   median ending portfolio value, 2.5.
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:46.360]   And so the way those medians are pulled,
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:51.360]   we do 10,000 simulation paths and we sort the results.
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.920]   So we have basically 10,000 ending portfolio values
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:55.760]   to deal with.
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:56.920]   How do we display that?
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:01.240]   Most effective, sort of easily to understand approach
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:02.560]   is to show the median.
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:06.280]   And that would be sort all 10,000 results in a table
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:09.400]   and then choose the result at row 5,000.
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:12.440]   That's how we would pull a median out of that.
[00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:15.280]   So again, 10,000 results, sort them in ascending order
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.840]   and then pull the middle one, the 5,000th one.
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.360]   And that's what we see here.
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:22.080]   Just to give it a little further on that,
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.720]   if we click this checkbox
[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:26.320]   that shows the portfolio value bands,
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:29.280]   notice that we see the lines here
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:32.040]   are showing the lower and upper band.
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:37.040]   And that's the 10% and 90% percentile bands.
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:41.280]   And we can see that seven looks like about 800,000
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:43.560]   is the bottom 10% value.
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:48.560]   And about 7 million is the top 10% value
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:50.920]   or the 90th percentile value.
[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:53.080]   So that the bottom value is actually again,
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:54.800]   and if you think of that sorted table
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.480]   with 10,000 ending portfolio values,
[00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.480]   the median is the 5,000th.
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:03.000]   The bottom 10% is actually the 1,000th row.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   And then the top 10% is the 9,000th row in that table,
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.320]   again, sorted in ascending order.
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:15.320]   So that gives you an idea of the variation that we have.
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:18.440]   The simulation is not producing one result
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:20.640]   and says, "Hey, here's your answer, we're done."
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:24.440]   It's actually producing a large amount of output.
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.880]   And the job is to try to consolidate it
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.720]   into something that's understandable.
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:32.320]   (papers rustling)
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:36.040]   And the other thing I wanted to draw your attention to
[00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:39.040]   is this percent of expenses funded.
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:42.320]   We've got the flexible spending policy selected,
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.120]   that's the one with the decision rule.
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:46.720]   But because this is such a robust plan,
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:50.840]   we're actually funding between 97 and 113% of expenses.
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:54.120]   So we're not having to cut back our spending
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:57.360]   much more than just a few percent here on average
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:00.080]   in the retirement plan.
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:04.120]   The other thing that I wanna bring to your attention
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:05.960]   is the detailed view table.
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:07.960]   This is a year by year table
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:10.560]   that allows you to see the result.
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:13.920]   Oh, by the way, the results both in the summary view
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:15.600]   and in the detailed view table
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:18.240]   are all shown in present value dollars.
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:23.040]   So the planner takes inflation into account
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.600]   and all of these amounts are adjusted for inflation
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.040]   as we go through the plan,
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:30.920]   but they're shown in present value non-inflated dollars.
[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:33.560]   So the ending portfolio value
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:35.760]   will be a much greater amount in nominal dollars,
[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:40.640]   but it will have spending power of 2.5 million
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:41.840]   in today's dollars.
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:45.640]   And the detailed view is the same way.
[00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:47.840]   So all of the results in the table,
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.000]   and the simplest way to kind of grasp this,
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.320]   I think for many people,
[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:55.000]   is that the new investments and the retirement spending
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.960]   are actually adjusting for inflation.
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:00.480]   So they will increase every year in nominal amount,
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:03.320]   but notice in the table, they show as being flat,
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:04.600]   and that's because they're exactly
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.240]   keeping up with inflation.
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:09.200]   And because we're showing this in present value dollars,
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:12.280]   those amounts stay stable, stay steady from year to year,
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:14.720]   because they're exactly keeping up with inflation.
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.200]   If an amount is growing greater
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.280]   than the rate of inflation,
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:20.120]   it will increase from year to year in this table.
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:21.680]   And if the amount is growing less
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.280]   than the value of inflation, it will decrease.
[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:30.120]   So we can see here at the retirement year, at age 65,
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:33.360]   we see the cashflow situation starts to change.
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:38.360]   We go from putting 15,000 a year into our deferred account,
[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:43.960]   to now at age 65, we start planning to take $50,000 out.
[00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:46.480]   We need 50,000 of spending.
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:47.480]   And so you'll notice here,
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.880]   the total withdrawal is actually 62,500,
[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:53.160]   which is because the plan is grossing that up
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:54.840]   in order to account for income taxes
[00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:58.600]   that are gonna be due on that tax deferred withdrawal.
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.120]   The other thing I wanna bring your attention to
[00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:03.120]   is on the right hand, the rightmost column
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:04.800]   is the probability of success
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:07.240]   and the number of failures in parentheses.
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:09.640]   So the probability of success is a cumulative number
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:12.680]   as you go from row to row or year to year.
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:15.480]   And then the number of failures in parens
[00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:18.680]   are the number of times out of 10,000
[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:20.840]   that the simulation ran out of money
[00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:22.640]   in that particular year.
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:24.760]   So you'll see, we start to pick up some failures
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:27.160]   starting at age 80, even we have one.
[00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:31.040]   And so it still shows 100% because out of 10,000,
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:32.160]   it's just a rounding error
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:34.160]   when you only have one failure out of 10,000.
[00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:38.240]   But you'll notice as we kind of go down the list,
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:43.240]   we get more and more failures until we finally get enough 50,
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:46.680]   we probably need to get from 100 down to 99.
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:48.320]   I assume it's rounding down there.
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:54.120]   And so we're seeing the failures here from year to year
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:56.440]   just as an indication of kind of how things are going,
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:57.280]   what's happening.
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:04.800]   And also I wanna show more details in this table.
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.120]   You can see even more,
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:08.080]   now this can get overwhelming pretty fast,
[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.960]   but it's a lot of data.
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:13.160]   And basically one of the things that you can see here
[00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.440]   in this additional detailed table
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:18.280]   is that we start to look at age 72,
[00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:20.200]   we start pulling RMDs out
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.960]   and you can kind of track what's going on
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:24.280]   with required minimum distributions
[00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.160]   from the tax deferred account.
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:30.560]   So we start with, and we've got the amount and the taxes
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:33.080]   and then how much available for expenses.
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:36.320]   It looks like we don't need to take any withdrawal
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:39.440]   out of the portfolio because of the RMD
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:42.360]   is greater than what we need, I believe.
[00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:45.680]   Yeah, no additional withdrawal needed.
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:48.880]   Now this table can be a little overwhelming,
[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:50.560]   but if that's not enough data for you,
[00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:53.160]   you could right click on any of the column headers
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.040]   and you can say, show all columns,
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:57.480]   which will give you even more data.
[00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:59.400]   And the idea is that I'm just basically dumping
[00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:02.280]   all of the information that I have in the simulation.
[00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:05.440]   And if you right click on any cell,
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:08.520]   you can copy it to the clipboard or export the table
[00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:10.640]   and it'll paste right into Excel.
[00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:11.960]   I'm sorry, yeah, right click on this
[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:14.080]   and this will paste into Excel.
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.360]   So you can then manipulate it
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:17.240]   and manage it a little bit easier.
[00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:26.280]   Okay, I wanna go back to the summary view.
[00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:30.520]   And let's say, because this plan is so robust,
[00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:33.600]   let's see what happens if we lower the retirement age
[00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:35.840]   to see if maybe we could retire at 60.
[00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:39.320]   Then we run it again.
[00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:42.800]   And now we notice this is,
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:46.840]   we get a 93% probability of success, so that's not bad,
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:49.440]   but the stoplight is yellow, not green.
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:51.960]   And the reason for that is because it's just indicating
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:54.720]   that the percent of expenses funded varied
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:59.720]   because of the flexible spending policy down as low as 86%.
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:04.760]   So you might've had to take a 15% reduction in spending
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:10.120]   in some of the runs of this particular set of inputs
[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:12.440]   in order to get that 93%.
[00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:17.440]   And we can configure that by going into settings
[00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:21.200]   to see if what the minimum amount
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:24.240]   or the maximum amount of spending cut we're willing to take.
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:29.280]   So the minimum default is 75%.
[00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:32.920]   So we're actually, by default, the minimum,
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:37.320]   the spending cut could be as big as 25%.
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:40.080]   And that's deployed gradually over the simulation
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:43.400]   as the portfolio is continuing to decline.
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:47.280]   Basically, a really unlucky bad sequence of returns happens.
[00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:50.840]   The planner will knock back a couple few percent
[00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:52.680]   off of spending every year
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:56.440]   until it gets down to 75% of the desired spending,
[00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:58.800]   and then it won't knock back anymore after that.
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:15:59.800]   But we can adjust this.
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:01.560]   And so let's set this to 90%
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:03.480]   so that we're willing to be flexible,
[00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:05.960]   but not that flexible is what we're saying here
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:09.680]   with this 90% minimum expenses to fund.
[00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:12.080]   So we're doing, again, we're using that decision rule,
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:15.160]   but we're only willing to cut back 10%.
[00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:16.160]   And let's see what that does.
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.720]   We had a 93% probability of success,
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:23.720]   and then we had the spending getting cut down below 90.
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:25.600]   We run it again.
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:28.600]   Now we've dropped the probability of success
[00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:30.880]   because we're not willing to be as flexible,
[00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:34.280]   but we see that we're maintaining that 90%.
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:37.640]   So let's see if maybe if we up the retirement age by a year,
[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:39.800]   does that get us to a 90?
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:43.440]   And I'm picking a 90% just as a random amount.
[00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:44.600]   Everyone has to sort of choose
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:47.440]   what amount of success is adequate for them.
[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:52.880]   But notice now, so we can kind of model that,
[00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:54.560]   all right, now we've got the green light
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:57.640]   because we've got a probability of success of 90%,
[00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:00.800]   and we also are not having to cut back more than 10%
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:02.560]   in order to get that 90%.
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:04.680]   So that's just a general overview
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:09.560]   of the retirement's flexible spending model.
[00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:13.240]   Now, notice if we chose the stable spending
[00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:16.520]   and we were completely unwilling and unable to cut expenses,
[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:19.520]   we wanted to exactly fund what we asked for
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:23.120]   until the portfolio runs out of money, what happens then?
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:25.760]   And notice we dropped back seven or so percent.
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:30.920]   So that flexibility got us a pretty decent boost
[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:33.560]   in terms of the robustness of the plan.
[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:36.760]   And that's what we're trying to model there.
[00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:40.040]   Okay, next I wanna move on
[00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:43.280]   to a feature called sensitivity analysis.
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:45.080]   And this is a feature that lets you
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:49.520]   take a look at varying the parameters of the plan
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:53.720]   in a way that saves you from having to make a change,
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:55.440]   hit run, make another change, hit run,
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:57.720]   and try to make sense of all the different data.
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:59.640]   For instance, by default, this is set up
[00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:02.640]   to look at the portfolio return standard deviation
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:05.800]   as parameter one and the annual retirement spending
[00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:07.560]   as parameter two.
[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:09.000]   And so we're gonna vary the return.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.680]   And this is a case where we're gonna have
[00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:14.840]   the portfolio return and standard deviation
[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:16.280]   march in lockstep.
[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:20.000]   So we're gonna have 3% return with 2% standard deviation
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.440]   all the way up to 12% return with 18% standard deviation.
[00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:27.200]   And then we're gonna have spending vary from 40 to 90,000.
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:29.120]   So then we'll see what this generates.
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:33.160]   So we're running the simulation
[00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:35.880]   actually about three or 400 times here.
[00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:38.880]   These are three or 400 times we run the simulation.
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:40.800]   Each of those times we use a different set
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:43.120]   of parameter one, parameter two inputs,
[00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:44.840]   and you can see those up here.
[00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:47.800]   The right-hand panel is showing you the results
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:52.160]   of one of those 300 simulation runs.
[00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:54.880]   And so we're at this top square,
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:58.360]   but we could also select another square by clicking on
[00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:00.840]   and we see what were the parameter one
[00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:02.240]   and parameter two values.
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:06.160]   We had a return of 10 and a standard deviation of 14.
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:07.640]   We had retirement spending of 50
[00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:10.040]   and a 93% probability of success.
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:15.040]   So we can get an idea here of what kind of return we need
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:16.840]   and what kind of spending we can support.
[00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:18.560]   And it looks like with this model,
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:23.280]   we can just about support 57,000 or so
[00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:26.400]   if we want a 90 something probability,
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:29.320]   maybe even up to 60 or 65 if the return,
[00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:32.000]   if we assume a really high return.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.280]   But the idea here is just to let you kind of explore
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:37.280]   variations in the inputs.
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:39.160]   Let's do this again, only this time,
[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:41.880]   let's say we're wondering about what we should put down
[00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:43.200]   for the inflation rate.
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:45.480]   And we're just, you know, how careful do we have to be
[00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:47.840]   about figuring out what inflation to use?
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:50.520]   And so we maybe we'll put 1% as the minimum
[00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:52.800]   and 4% of the max.
[00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:55.600]   And then for the second parameter,
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:57.480]   let's say we're wondering about income tax.
[00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:01.400]   You know, how much sensitivity do we have in our plan
[00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:03.880]   to changes in the income tax rate?
[00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:07.440]   And because we have so much in tax deferred,
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:08.600]   this is gonna matter a lot
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:10.520]   because those tax deferred withdrawals
[00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:13.040]   are taxed at the income tax rate.
[00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:14.120]   Let's run this.
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:18.240]   And now we're seeing again, those three or so 100 runs
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:23.240]   and getting an idea of if we vary these two parameters,
[00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:25.000]   what does it look like?
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.600]   And you can see on the X axis,
[00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:30.320]   we've got the inflation rate increasing from 1% to 4%.
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:33.800]   On the Y axis, we've got the income tax rate increasing
[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:35.800]   from 10% to 50%.
[00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:39.320]   And so we can just get an idea now with one view
[00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:43.160]   and we can see what the results are
[00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:45.560]   with these varying inputs to get an idea
[00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:48.640]   of how that is gonna work out.
[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:55.400]   Great, and the last thing I wanna cover on the planner
[00:20:55.400 --> 00:21:00.400]   is another feature that helps with the flexibility
[00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:03.840]   is the additional inputs.
[00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:05.840]   And so we get to additional inputs
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:08.600]   by clicking on the additional inputs button here.
[00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:11.240]   And in this case, what I'm gonna do
[00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:13.120]   is let's just say that this plan is actually
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:15.320]   for a married couple and they're not the same age.
[00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:18.040]   So I'm gonna zero out this annual retirement income
[00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:19.800]   on the main input page.
[00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:21.560]   And instead, I'm gonna put it in
[00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:24.200]   on the additional inputs page here in the bottom.
[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:27.280]   And I'm gonna say, starting at age 67,
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:30.920]   the older spouse is gonna start collecting
[00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:35.680]   their social security and they're gonna get 12,500
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:37.240]   for their annual social security.
[00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:39.320]   And we're gonna say it's 100% taxable.
[00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:42.920]   And we'll say, this is John's.
[00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:47.520]   John's social security, we add row.
[00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:54.040]   And now we have John's spouse is Mary.
[00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:57.960]   And Mary is two years younger than John.
[00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:00.560]   And she also wants to have her social security
[00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:03.960]   start at age 67, but because we're gonna key
[00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:07.320]   all of the ages in this plan off of the older spouse.
[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:11.400]   So when John turns 69, Mary's gonna start collecting
[00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:12.760]   her social security.
[00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:18.600]   And so now we have social security for two.
[00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:20.160]   Notice that we've got it set up
[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:22.560]   that it's automatically gonna track inflation
[00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:25.840]   and we have it at 100% taxable.
[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:31.240]   And so now we go into the, back to the main planner window.
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:36.520]   And if we run this again, we notice there's a slight drop
[00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:40.560]   in the probability of success because we had
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:44.760]   one of the spouses taking that social security
[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:45.680]   two years later.
[00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:49.240]   If we bump the retirement age up,
[00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:53.880]   we can get it back up to over 90%.
[00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:55.240]   And again, I'm just using that.
[00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:57.960]   That's kind of, for me, I like to see over 90,
[00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:01.000]   but everybody's gotta make their own rules
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.640]   about what works for them.
[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:06.120]   The other thing you can model with this is in,
[00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:09.760]   if you wanna do one-time spending,
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:14.760]   maybe like you might have a MISC income.
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:17.880]   And let's say that we wanna downsize our house
[00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:22.040]   and we're gonna plan to do that at age 80.
[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:25.360]   And so we'll say, we'll have a one-year cashflow.
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:28.640]   The start age and the end age will be the same at age 80.
[00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:35.040]   And then we'll say that we're gonna net,
[00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:38.000]   maybe this will be sell the house that's out in the country
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.560]   and move into an in-town apartment or condo.
[00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:44.680]   And doing that, we're gonna net $350,000.
[00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:48.200]   So that will be the amount of the cashflow.
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:51.560]   And let's say that we're gonna have to pay tax
[00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:53.240]   on that whole amount at the tax rate.
[00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:56.720]   Again, we could adjust this and put a net amount in here
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:58.520]   and say the taxable rate is zero.
[00:23:58.520 --> 00:23:59.360]   If that's easier,
[00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:02.080]   depending on how complicated the taxes are gonna be,
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:03.920]   maybe it wouldn't wanna,
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:06.720]   maybe this mortgage, this house sale wouldn't be taxed
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:08.040]   at our normal income tax rate.
[00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:09.800]   So we might wanna adjust that
[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:13.400]   and just do the calculation kind of offline sort of,
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:14.680]   and put the net amount in here.
[00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:15.760]   Either way could work.
[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:19.560]   And we'll say sell downsize.
[00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:26.080]   And we add a row.
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:29.280]   And so now we go back to the main planner page
[00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:32.160]   and we run again.
[00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:36.440]   And now we can see that we've got
[00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:38.080]   a much higher probability of success.
[00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:41.420]   We probably can support that 60-year retirement again.
[00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:46.340]   And we can see that this bump in the portfolio
[00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:49.380]   right at age 80 when the house sale kicks in,
[00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:50.660]   when the downsizing kicks in.
[00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:53.780]   So that extra cashflow goes into the taxable portfolio
[00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:58.780]   and you can see it turned it into a much more robust plan.
[00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:01.180]   Another thing you might wanna try in here
[00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:04.140]   and we're getting down to the end.
[00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:10.260]   Let's say that starting at age 85,
[00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:15.460]   we wanna simulate higher expenses
[00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:17.180]   because of maybe some medical things.
[00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:19.380]   Now, maybe we just wanna try this out and see what happens.
[00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:22.860]   It might not necessarily be what we're gonna plan for,
[00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:25.420]   for real, but we could explore this
[00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:29.420]   with a say $20,000 expense.
[00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:33.820]   And let's say this is a medical expense
[00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:40.100]   and we don't even need to come in it.
[00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:41.260]   We put that in.
[00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:45.060]   We go back to the main plan and run it again.
[00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:55.860]   And notice we now are down a little bit
[00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:59.540]   on the probability of success.
[00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:04.540]   We're still increasing, but not as quick of a rate
[00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:06.420]   again after the house sale kicks in.
[00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:10.020]   One last thing we could try here.
[00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:12.780]   If we just wanna, again, we're kind of playing around
[00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:14.700]   and we maybe wanna explore what happens
[00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:16.820]   if we just have really bad luck
[00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:21.180]   and we have a stock market crash at age 75.
[00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:24.700]   So 10 years in the stock market does really badly.
[00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:26.260]   Now, of course, the simulation,
[00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:29.700]   because it's running this random return,
[00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:31.780]   random sequences of return 10,000 times,
[00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:33.940]   we are going to get stock market crashes
[00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:38.340]   randomly dispersed through the whole simulation,
[00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:41.020]   but we're gonna just force a crash at age 85
[00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:44.460]   and we're gonna force it to be minus 25%
[00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:46.060]   with a standard deviation of zero.
[00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:47.940]   So it's definitely gonna happen.
[00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:51.340]   And so basically we're overriding the portfolio return
[00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:54.300]   to make sure that we get this crash to happen at age 75.
[00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:56.340]   And let's see what that does to our plan.
[00:26:56.340 --> 00:27:05.540]   Now we see we have the stock market crash at age 75,
[00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:09.180]   drops the portfolio down quite a bit.
[00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:11.380]   We kind of chug along for a bit.
[00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:14.780]   Then we have the house downsizing, which brings us back up.
[00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:17.380]   And now we're kind of doing okay
[00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:18.740]   for the last part of the retirement.
[00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:22.660]   So we did manage to work through that,
[00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:25.460]   it appears, at least based on this model.
[00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:27.220]   And so that's just to give you an overview
[00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:28.700]   of the kind of things that you can do
[00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:31.500]   with the retirement planner.
[00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:34.620]   And again, there's a lot of.
[00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:37.340]   (upbeat music)
[00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:40.740]   (upbeat music continues)
[00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:44.140]   (upbeat music continues)
[00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:47.540]   (upbeat music continues)
[00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:51.140]   (upbeat music continues)
[00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:53.720]   (upbeat music)
[00:27:53.720 --> 00:28:03.720]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
