[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.680]   Today we field a fairly technical question about whether or not our happiness is moral.
[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.880]   It's a question from a listener named Eric.
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.560]   "Hello Pastor John, this podcast is a tremendous gift to me.
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.200]   I've listened from my conversion until now in seminary."
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.760]   That's incredible, Pastor John.
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.200]   We've been doing this for the duration of someone getting saved and entering seminary.
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.120]   Eric continues, "I have a question regarding happiness.
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.880]   What would you say to this line from theologian John Frame?
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.320]   Only persons and their actions and attitudes can be good in a moral sense, but happiness
[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:44.720]   is a condition or a state of affairs, so it can be considered good only in a non-moral
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:45.720]   sense."
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.560]   That's from the Doctrine of the Christian Life, pages 91 and 92.
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.040]   He goes on to say this, "There are many things that human beings value more than pleasure.
[00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.720]   One example is sacrificing one's life to save the life of another.
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.760]   If we define pleasure so broadly as to include all other values, including self-sacrifice,
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.220]   then it loses its meaning.
[00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.360]   It doesn't distinguish pleasurable from non-pleasurable activities."
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.760]   That's page 93.
[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.120]   My immediate reaction to this was, "That's not right.
[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:21.560]   Piper and Edwards and Augustine all say that pleasure is what we all desire most, and it
[00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:27.120]   is a moral good that God commands our joy," in Philippians 3.1, "Rejoice in the Lord."
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.360]   But then Frame surprised me in the next chapter by saying this, "For Scripture, duty and
[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.720]   happiness are not opposed, but in the long run reinforce one another."
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.260]   That's page 101 of Frame's book.
[00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.560]   That seems more in line with Christian hedonism, namely that our happiness and God's glory
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.840]   are not two separate things, but we must seek them both together.
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.080]   My question for you, Pastor John, is this.
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.480]   Am I misunderstanding Christian hedonism?
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.120]   Is happiness a non-moral good, or is it a moral good?
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.720]   Pastor John, what would you say to Eric?
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:07.240]   It is very risky and unwatched to criticize a great Christian thinker on the basis of
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.720]   a sentence or two that I don't see in context.
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:19.280]   John Frame is a great and sound and helpful theological guide, and my guess is that if
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:28.680]   he and I had time, he and I would discuss this and we probably would be pretty close
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.680]   in the end.
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.960]   So what I'm going to do then, since this is such an important question, is take these
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:42.600]   statements and Eric's question and use them to illustrate two very important principles
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.160]   in answering such questions, as well as give my answer along the way.
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.520]   So the first principle is this.
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:58.020]   Before you disagree or agree with anyone, be sure you have a clear sense of the definitions
[00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:06.160]   of the terms they are using as they're using them, a definition that they would agree with.
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.680]   Otherwise, you'll talk right past each other in your argument.
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.580]   It happens over and over again.
[00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:12.860]   You can watch it in the internet.
[00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.680]   You can watch it in conversations.
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.200]   So let's take Frame's main statement.
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.200]   Here it is.
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:26.320]   "Only persons and their actions and attitudes can be good in a moral sense, but happiness
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:33.920]   is a condition or state of affairs, so it can be considered good only in a non-moral
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.320]   sense."
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:41.320]   So the term "persons," I think, clear enough, I think we know what persons are, so I'll
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.000]   skip that one.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.920]   What about the term "actions"?
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.400]   Actions can be good in a moral sense, he said.
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:56.520]   Does he mean, I would ask, bodily actions, namely the mere movement of muscles and the
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:01.400]   electronic and chemical processes that trigger the muscle contraction that moves when you
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.880]   hug somebody or give them a finger?
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:11.280]   Or does he mean actions of the soul, volitions, decisions, choices?
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:18.520]   Surely soul actions, choices, can be morally good, but mere muscle movements?
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:27.480]   Well, he would probably say—this is why we need to talk—not mere, no, not mere,
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:35.000]   he would say muscular actions insofar as they are triggered by volitions can be morally
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   good or bad.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.800]   I would say, yes, yes, okay, good, got that clarified now.
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:47.200]   And the combination of choice and movement of muscle make the movement good or bad.
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:55.080]   It isn't movement of muscles or actions, legs or shoulders or arms or hands or facial
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:02.480]   expressions, smile, frown, those movements are not in themselves evil or good, they are
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:09.040]   evil or good insofar as they are triggered by, carried by, expressing volitions that
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.400]   are good or bad.
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:11.400]   What about the word "attitudes"?
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:16.080]   He says attitudes can be good in a moral sense.
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.720]   Well, what is an attitude?
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.240]   He must consider it different from happiness.
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.200]   Hmm, okay, that helps a little bit.
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.520]   Now, what's an attitude?
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:32.480]   I assume he means perhaps the fruit of the spirit, like patience, that be an attitude,
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:39.840]   kindness, in other words, dispositions of the soul not yet turned into action that incline
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.560]   a certain way to good or bad.
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:54.360]   And then he calls happiness a state of affairs, which can't be good morally, but only non-morally,
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:06:01.800]   like having a sore throat, I suppose, is non-morally bad, but being in good health is non-morally
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.680]   good.
[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.560]   He's free to define happiness that way.
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.160]   I assume it's something like that.
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.560]   We just need to be aware that's what he's doing.
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:21.320]   If happiness is in that category in this sentence, namely it's like getting rid of a headache,
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:27.600]   of course then we need to decide how the Bible uses the term if we're going to talk about
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.560]   biblical meaning for happiness.
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:32.640]   So that's the first principle.
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:37.920]   I'm just illustrating what I have to go through when I deal with what I read or what people
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:38.920]   say.
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:46.760]   I want to be sure to define your terms in your way so that I can either agree or disagree.
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.720]   And it's not easy to do that often.
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.440]   Second principle.
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:57.480]   Instead of getting entangled in complicated philosophical conceptions, go to the Bible
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:04.640]   as quickly as you can to find some clear statements about the very meaning, the very thing, the
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.440]   very reality you are arguing about.
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:16.360]   It's wonderful, amazing how the Bible enables us to cut through so much fog in our arguments
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:24.640]   with people if we have a few clear biblical statements that shed light on what we are
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:26.000]   arguing about.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.120]   Now, Frame is right.
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:35.920]   Surely he's right to say that if we treat the word pleasure so broadly that there's
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:43.840]   no difference between pleasurable and non-pleasurable activities, language loses its meaning.
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:44.840]   That's right.
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:45.840]   That just is self-evident.
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:54.080]   Now, the question is, does that settle the issue over whether happiness or pleasure can
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:56.720]   be a moral good?
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:59.520]   So we turn quickly to the Bible.
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.640]   That's what I do anyway.
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:05.680]   First we find a verse that helps us appreciate the distinction.
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:11.640]   I want to frame the absolute benefit of the doubt here with a text like this, 2 Timothy
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:13.120]   3:4.
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:20.600]   Paul says, "There will be evil people, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God."
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:26.680]   Now, for a Christian hedonist like me, that's a jarring statement because it makes love
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:34.680]   for God look like an alternative to the desire to experience pleasure.
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:38.200]   So we step back and we say, "Okay, I'm not God.
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.400]   I am not the Bible.
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.000]   I'm not the final authority.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.680]   The Bible is the authority, and I will adjust my thinking to the Bible.
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:47.180]   That's what we should do."
[00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:49.520]   So what does the Bible mean?
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:53.780]   It means here pretty much what Frame means.
[00:08:53.780 --> 00:09:01.500]   Pleasure is very often used in the narrow sense of physical gratification, sensations
[00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:08.280]   of bodily satisfaction, like a back rub or sexual arousal or getting high with drugs
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:12.120]   and alcohol or caffeine or scratching an itch.
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:21.320]   It is indeed possible to want these physical sensations more than we want God.
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:25.200]   It is possible to make a God out of physical satisfaction.
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.680]   And I suppose that's what Frame is getting at here.
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:35.320]   He is saying that if you try to take that meaning for pleasure and spread it over everything
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:41.960]   in life, then you have to drop the word "pain" out of your vocabulary because pleasure understood
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:44.360]   in this narrow way is the opposite of pain.
[00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:49.400]   And you can't say everything ought to be pleasurable because that would rule out the existence
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:56.040]   of anything like pain if you define pleasure the way Paul does in 2 Timothy 3:4 and the
[00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:57.920]   way Frame is.
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:05.200]   However, what Eric is very aware of in his question is that the Bible does not treat
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:12.080]   happiness and pleasure and joy, which are often used interchangeably in the Bible, as
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:16.480]   mere states of affairs that have no moral significance.
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:19.320]   Now we're getting close to the problem.
[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:25.960]   And the easiest way to see this is to notice that happiness or delight or gladness or pleasure
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:30.760]   are regularly commanded in the Bible as a Christian duty.
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:34.480]   Psalm 100, "Serve the Lord with gladness."
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:38.600]   2 Corinthians 9, "God loves a cheerful giver."
[00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:42.760]   Philippians 4, "Rejoice in the Lord, and again I say rejoice."
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:46.280]   Psalm 37, "Delight yourself in the Lord."
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:52.480]   Hebrews 13:17, "Pastors, do your ministry with joy because if you'd groan in it, it
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:57.120]   will be of no advantage to your people," and on and on and on.
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:04.400]   And then we noticed that just like patience is a fruit of the Spirit when we were defining
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:10.520]   the word attitude, so is joy a fruit of the Spirit.
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:18.960]   So if one is a gift and can be a moral good, why not the others?
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:19.960]   And I think they are.
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:27.800]   I think joy is a moral good as Paul is using it in these contexts where he commands it
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:29.720]   or calls it a fruit of the Spirit.
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:42.880]   So my conclusion is that if you define joy or happiness or delight or gladness biblically,
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:45.360]   all of them are moral.
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:52.000]   That is, they are evil or good, depending on whether they are grounded in and reflecting
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.760]   the greatness and beauty and worth of God.
[00:11:54.760 --> 00:12:00.040]   It's possible to have gladness in evil, and that's not good.
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:02.480]   But gladness in God is a moral good.
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:11.300]   It is sin to find your greatest happiness, delight, gladness, joy in created things.
[00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:17.600]   And it is virtuous or morally good to find your greatest happiness, delight, gladness,
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:19.680]   or joy in God.
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:22.640]   I don't think John Frame would disagree with that.
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:23.640]   I hope not.
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:29.880]   I think when he rejected happiness as a moral good, he meant something more akin to physical
[00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:35.560]   pleasure than to spiritual attraction to God's glory.
[00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:43.600]   So is happiness a non-moral good, or is it a moral good?
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:49.080]   Defined biblically as the positive experience of treasuring God above all, it is a moral
[00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:50.080]   good.
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:51.080]   Very good.
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:52.680]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:54.320]   And Eric, thank you for the detailed question.
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:55.560]   We really appreciate it.
[00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:56.880]   And thank you for listening.
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:01.880]   You can send us your own question like Eric did, or you can search our 1600 past episodes
[00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:04.640]   that we've released to date, or you can subscribe to the podcast.
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:09.100]   You can do all that at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:11.120]   Up next, a very good question about prayer.
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:15.320]   We know from scripture that a husband who is harsh with his wife will have his prayers
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:16.720]   ignored by God.
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:19.920]   We see that in 1 Peter 3.7.
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:22.560]   But is that principle at play more broadly?
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:23.640]   That's the question on Monday.
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:28.120]   Do all of our sins hinder our prayers?
[00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:29.120]   That's a great question.
[00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:31.640]   It's the topic up on Monday when we return.
[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:32.640]   And I am Tony Reinke.
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:36.640]   Thank you for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast with longtime pastor and author
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:37.640]   John Piper.
[00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:39.440]   We'll see you on the other side of the weekend.
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:49.440]   [END]
