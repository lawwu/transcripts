[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.180]   - Let me ask a silly question, but--
[00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:06.980]   - We'll say it with a straight face.
[00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.120]   - Impossible.
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:15.480]   So let me mention Elon Musk.
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.200]   What are your thoughts about,
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.960]   he's more, you're more on the physics theory side of things.
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.480]   He's more on the physics engineering side of things
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.800]   in terms of SpaceX efforts.
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.800]   What do you think of his efforts to get off this planet?
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.320]   - Well, I think he's the other guy
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.200]   who's semi-serious about getting off this planet.
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.400]   I think there are two of us
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.720]   who are semi-serious about getting off the planet.
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.880]   - What do you think about his methodology and yours?
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:47.880]   When you look at them--
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.920]   - Don't, I don't wanna be against Elon,
[00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.760]   because I was so excited that your top video
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.200]   was Ray Kurzweil, and then I did your podcast,
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.720]   and we had some chemistry, so it zoomed up.
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.400]   And I thought, okay, I'm gonna beat Ray Kurzweil.
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.800]   So just as I'm coming up on Ray Kurzweil,
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.400]   you're like, and now, Alex Fridman special Elon Musk,
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.600]   and he blew me out of the water.
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.480]   So I don't wanna be petty about it.
[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.820]   I wanna say that I don't, but I am.
[00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.420]   Okay, but here's the funny part.
[00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.120]   He's not taking enough risk.
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.040]   Like, he's trying to get us to Mars.
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.400]   Imagine that he got us to Mars, the moon,
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.960]   and will throw in Titan.
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.040]   And nowhere good enough.
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.040]   The diversification level is too low.
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.080]   Now, there's a compatibility.
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.800]   First of all, I don't think Elon is serious about Mars.
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.160]   I think Elon is using Mars.
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.480]   - As a narrative, as a story, as a dream?
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.880]   - To make the moon jealous.
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:45.960]   - To make the, no.
[00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.200]   (laughing)
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.760]   - I think he's using it as a story to organize us,
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.760]   to reacquaint ourselves with our need for space,
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.120]   our need to get off this planet.
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.480]   It's a concrete thing.
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.160]   He's shown that, many people think that he's shown
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.080]   that he's the most brilliant and capable person
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.920]   on the planet.
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.040]   I don't think that's what he showed.
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.360]   I think he showed that the rest of us
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.400]   have forgotten our capabilities.
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.800]   And so he's like the only guy who has still kept the faith,
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.360]   and is like, what's wrong with you people?
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.440]   - So you think the lesson we should draw from Elon Musk
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.680]   is there's a capable person within a lot of us.
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.760]   - Elon makes sense to me.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.200]   - In what way?
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.320]   - He's doing what any sensible person should do.
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.800]   He's trying incredible things,
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.280]   and he's partially succeeding, partially failing.
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.280]   - To try to solve the obvious problems before.
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.120]   - Duh.
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.940]   (laughing)
[00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.960]   But he comes up with things like, I got it.
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.360]   We'll come up with a battery company,
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.320]   but batteries aren't sexy, so we'll make a car around it.
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.160]   Like, great.
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.400]   (laughing)
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.340]   Or any one of a number of things.
[00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.600]   Elon is behaving like a sane person,
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.040]   and I view everyone else as insane.
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.560]   And my feeling is that we really have
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.920]   to get off this planet.
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.000]   We have to get out of this,
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.400]   we have to get out of the neighborhood.
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.320]   - Dilingual a little bit, do you think that's
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.040]   a physics problem or an engineering problem?
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.040]   - I think it's a cowardice problem.
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.040]   I think that we're afraid that we had 400 hitters
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.000]   of the mind, like Einstein and Dirac,
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.480]   and that era is done, and now we're just sort of
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.480]   copy editors.
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.440]   - So is some of it money?
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.160]   Like, if we become brave enough to go outside
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.080]   the solar system, can we afford to, financially?
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.320]   - Well, I think that that's not really the issue.
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.840]   The issue is, look what Elon did well.
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.240]   He amassed a lot of money.
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:46.720]   And then he plowed it back in, and he spun the wheel,
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.520]   and he made more money, and now he's got FU money.
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.840]   Now the problem is, is that a lot of the people
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.320]   who have FU money are not people whose middle finger
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.440]   you ever want to see.
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.240]   I want to see Elon's middle finger.
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.040]   I want to see what he's--
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:03.860]   - What do you mean by that?
[00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.560]   Or like, when you say, fuck it, I'm gonna do
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.400]   the biggest possible--
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.800]   - He's gonna do whatever the fuck he wants.
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:08.680]   - Yeah. - Right?
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.020]   Fuck you, fuck anything that gets in his way
[00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.760]   that he can afford to push out of his way.
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.720]   - And you're saying he's not actually even doing
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:15.760]   that enough.
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.280]   - No, I'm-- - He's not going--
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.680]   - Please, I'm gonna go, Elon's doing fine with his money.
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.400]   I just want him to enjoy himself,
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.240]   have the most Dionysian--
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.140]   - Well, no, but you're saying Mars is playing it safe.
[00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.080]   - He doesn't know how to do anything else.
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.560]   He knows rockets. - Yeah.
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.560]   - And he might know some physics at a fundamental level.
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.960]   - Yeah, I guess, okay, just let me just go right back to it.
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.680]   How much physics do you really,
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.240]   how much brilliant breakthrough ideas on the physics side
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.860]   do you need to get off this planet?
[00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.680]   - I don't know, and I don't know whether,
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.360]   like in my most optimistic dream,
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.920]   I don't know whether my stuff gets us off the planet,
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.580]   but it's hope.
[00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.840]   It's hope that there's a more fundamental theory
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.600]   that we can access, that we don't need,
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.980]   whose elegance and beauty will suggest
[00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.180]   that this is probably the way the universe goes.
[00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.940]   Like you have to say this weird thing,
[00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.480]   which is this I believe,
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.400]   and this I believe is a very dangerous statement,
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:27.400]   but this I believe, I believe that my theory points the way.
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:32.520]   Now, Elon might or might not be able to access my theory.
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.700]   I don't know what he knows, but keep in mind,
[00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:39.520]   why are we all so focused on Elon?
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.440]   It's really weird.
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.160]   It's kind of creepy too.
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.000]   - Why?
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.240]   - He's just the person who's just asking
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.640]   the obvious questions and doing whatever he can.
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:48.880]   - But he makes sense to me.
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.880]   You see, Craig Venter makes sense to me.
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.960]   Jim Watson makes sense to me.
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.960]   - But we're focusing on Elon because he somehow is rare.
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.700]   - Well, that's the weird thing.
[00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.040]   Like we've come up with a system
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.420]   that eliminates all Elon from our pipeline,
[00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:09.240]   and Elon somehow snuck through
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.080]   when they weren't quality adjusting everything, you know?
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.920]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.760]   - And he's just like, "I'm not gonna do this."
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:15.600]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:16.440]   - And he's just like, "I'm not gonna do this."
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:17.260]   - Yeah.
[00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:18.100]   - And he's just like, "I'm not gonna do this."
[00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:18.940]   - Yeah.
[00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:19.760]   - And he's just like, "I'm not gonna do this."
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:20.600]   - Yeah.
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.440]   - And he's just like, "I'm not gonna do this."
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:22.260]   - Yeah.
[00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:23.100]   - And he's just like, "I'm not gonna do this."
[00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.940]   - Yeah.
[00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:24.760]   - And he's just like, "I'm not gonna do this."
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:25.600]   - Yeah.
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:26.440]   - And he's just like, "I'm not gonna do this."
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:27.260]   - Yeah.
[00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:28.100]   - And he's just like, "I'm not gonna do this."
[00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:28.940]   - Yeah.
[00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:34.400]   Thanks for watching.
