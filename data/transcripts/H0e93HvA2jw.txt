[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720]   [Music]
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.480]   Our next question is from Positive.
[00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.320]   Positive says, "What have you learned during this pandemic?"
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:18.720]   That's a good question. I've definitely learned some lessons.
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.320]   There are some predictions I made early in the pandemic in writing, so I should maybe go back
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:30.400]   and revisit those and see what I learned. So I made a prediction early in the pandemic. This was
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.320]   in GQ, I believe. This was probably in a Clay Skipper interview for GQ, where early on in the
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:45.360]   pandemic, I made the claim that probably one of the number one public health measures that we
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.400]   could make if we wanted to just objectively measure, especially mental health, the number
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.360]   one public health measure that we could probably have taken at the beginning of the pandemic was
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.720]   to shut down Twitter. I was seeing the writing on the wall, and I said, "This is not going to be a
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.360]   source for good in the months ahead." That was prediction number one. Prediction number two,
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.920]   I made in the pages of The New Yorker in May of 2020, so again, real early in the pandemic. And I
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:15.680]   said, "Look, there's going to be a lot of pain felt by suddenly remote knowledge workers, because
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.760]   we have been working with this hyperactive hive mind style of ad hoc on-demand work, which kind
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.720]   of works when we're all in the same place, but can go haywire if we're all spread out and
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.760]   distributed. So I think people are going to feel a lot of pain. The hyperactive hive mind is going
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:35.440]   to spin out of control when we all go remote, and this is going to inspire us to say, "Okay,
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.680]   once and for all, we have to structure how we work more as knowledge workers. We can't just rock and
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.560]   roll on email and Zoom and Slack. We have to have more structured processes. We have to do more
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.520]   Cal Newport-style world without email ideas." All right, so let's revisit those predictions.
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:58.400]   Twitter being a force of negativity, 100% correct. If you had any fondness for social media
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:04.560]   pre-pandemic, you probably have lost it all now that we're in the final stages of the pandemic.
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:11.760]   It was an injection straight to the veins of poison for so much of the population during the
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:19.440]   pandemic. I think we also learned nuance about technology, right? I think we would, early in
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.960]   the pandemic, lump all of these different technologies together and be like, "I don't know
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:29.120]   technology. I need it to talk to my family because we can't visit them because of a lockdown." But we
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.680]   gained nuance as the pandemic unfolded that, "Wait a second, there's a difference between
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.440]   I can text message my siblings. There's a difference between I can set up a Zoom meeting
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.560]   with my parents so that we can talk when we can't visit each other in person. There's a difference
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:53.920]   between that and I'm having a drag-out fight on Twitter with someone I've never met in Alabama,
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:00.160]   and I'm literally shaking with rage." There's a difference between Twitter and texting.
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.760]   There's a difference between Facebook and Zooming. There's communicating with digital
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.840]   technology—thumbs up. We loved that during the pandemic. We were glad we have it.
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:14.080]   And there's social media platforms—thumbs down. I think it made us all into maniacs.
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.400]   So I think that prediction was right. Social media became much more poisonous, and we realized
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:25.920]   we can embrace digital communication without having to embrace yelling at people over Twitter
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.400]   windows. All right, so that was a good prediction. Second prediction—I was kind of wrong.
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:36.080]   I was right in the first part. I was right about the part that the remote work was going to spiral
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.440]   out of control because we have no structure on how we work, and going remote is going to make
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.160]   it worse. That was right. It did spiral out of control. So many knowledge workers fell into an
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.160]   existence where they just went from Zoom to Zoom to Zoom to Zoom. It was absurd. It was like we
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.280]   were in a Kafka play doing some sort of absurdist satire about the modern working life where we just
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.600]   did meetings all day long and never actually got to doing work. I was wrong about the second piece
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:03.040]   of that prediction, which was, "And this will lead us to make major changes in how we work."
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:08.160]   And that didn't happen. Basically, the companies just waited it out and now are saying, "Okay,
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.560]   let's just get back to the office and get back to what we were doing before."
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:16.640]   What I underestimated was, yes, that was painful. These eight- or nine-hour-in-a-row
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:22.800]   Zoom marathons that work devolved into really was pretty terrible, but there's lots of terrible
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:28.240]   things going on last year. So we were willing to—the pain of this one thing we just chalked up
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.680]   to everything stinks in a pandemic year, everything's terrible, we're used to things being
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.920]   terrible, so it didn't motivate us to take action. So I was wrong about that. So that's one thing I
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:41.920]   learned. Moving away from these type of tech or work predictions, I think there's a bigger picture
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.880]   message that I came to grips with during the pandemic that's probably more important in the
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:52.800]   long term, and I think a lot of people encountered this message as well, which is the value of
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:59.840]   slowness. So the disruption for knowledge workers, for what they would call non-essential workers,
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.600]   you said, "Great, I guess I'm just at home and I'm doing some Zoom and I'm not commuting to the work
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:10.240]   and I'm not traveling." There's a certain level of busyness that disappeared. There's a much bigger
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.840]   injection of just, "I'm here now, I'm home." For some god-awful reason, my kids are here too,
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:21.520]   they're not in school. And it was a different type of lifestyle that we were being exposed to,
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:27.040]   and a lot of people were extracting out of that disruption that there's value,
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:35.520]   there is appeal in the human condition to slowing things down, spending more time with people that
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:40.880]   you are close to, spending more time just walking those same trails in your neighborhood because
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.600]   there's nowhere else to go, talking to your neighbors over the fence for long periods of
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:51.440]   time because what else are you going to do in the afternoon in March of 2020? And of course,
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:55.200]   the right answer to that question is drink. But you know, you could drink and talk to your
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:00.640]   neighbors over the fence and spend time with your kids. Slowness emerged as something that's
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:08.800]   important. And so my whole very nascent ideas about slow productivity, about rebuilding work
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.800]   life, about doing less things and doing those things better, about more sequentiality, one
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.440]   thing after another, not a lot of things at the same time, moving from a push model of work where
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.280]   everyone who needs you put stuff on your plate to a pull model where you pull things from people
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.880]   when you're ready for it. I think there's something here that's really important. There's
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:30.400]   something in here that could better align how we live our professional lives with the reality of
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.760]   the human condition. And I don't quite know how all this works yet, but it's the pandemic that
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:38.160]   got me thinking about it. And I think a lot of people got thinking about this as well because
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:44.240]   of their experiences with the pandemic. So stay tuned for that. Slowness is my theme for 2022,
[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:53.840]   and hopefully it's something we'll develop a little bit more.
