I don't understand how anybody who owns and watches a TV ever maintains a quiet spirit. Because when you, as soon as you flip it on, you can't really choose what comes in. It just comes in at you.

[00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:16.720]   The problem with TV is not what's on it. The problem is what you're not doing when you're doing something like watching TV. It's the opportunity cost. See, you could spend time watching TV, but you're not doing it when you're doing something like watching TV. It's the opportunity cost.

[00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:48.140]   You could spend time reading a book that would help feed your goals, feed you in something that you really want and teach you how to do it. Or I guess books are bad movies. They don't read anymore. You and I are the only ones who read. Most people don't. Let me use a non-book example. You could spend time on a YouTube channel that is going to inspire you and educate you about something that you care about instead of just being a passive consumer of what comes into you over the broadcast or cable TV network.

[00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:51.080]   There's the old quote.
[00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:52.340]   Uh, who was it?
[00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:55.920]   Um, I forget, I forget, um, who to ascribe it to.
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:58.680]   But, that you're the average of the five people that you,
[00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:03.160]   the books, five years from today, you'll be the average of the books that you read

[00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:31.540]   I butchered that one. It's a true quote.
[00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:31.580]   It's a true quote. Here's what's cool though.
[00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:31.620]   Here's what's cool though. You've always been able to choose the books that you read.
[00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:31.640]   You've always been able to choose the books that you read.
[00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:31.640]   I know reading's out of vogue, I know, but man, if you're not reading books that are teaching you things, you're just behaving dumbly.
[00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:31.680]   You've always been able to choose the books that you read.
[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:31.680]   You've always been able to choose the books that you read.
[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:31.740]   You've always been able to choose the books that you read.
[00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:31.820]   You've always been able to choose the books that you read.
[00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:31.840]   You've always been able to choose the books that you read the books that you read.
[00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:37.000]   If you're not good at reading, learn to do it. Take a class. Learn to read.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:44.980]   But there is no better return on investment than you get with reading.
[00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:53.420]   Do you understand that when somebody writes a book, they invest at the very minimum hundreds of hours into that labor?
[00:41:53.420 --> 00:42:01.520]   Usually, those hundreds of hours come after years and years of experience,
[00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:31.640]  , and that's not the case with a book.
[00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:31.700]   Most people, when they start reading a book, they invest at the very minimum hundreds of hours into that labor.
[00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:31.700]   Most people, when they start reading a book, they invest at the very minimum hundreds of hours into that labor.
[00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:31.700]   Most people, when they start reading a book, they invest at the very minimum hundreds of hours into that labor.
[00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:31.700]   Most people, when they start reading a book, they invest at the very minimum hundreds of hours into that labor.
[00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:31.700]   Most people, when they start reading a book, they invest at the very minimum hundreds of hours into that labor.
[00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:31.700]   Most people, when they start reading a book, they invest at the very minimum hundreds of hours into that labor.
[00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:31.700]   Most people, when they start reading a book, they invest at the very minimum hundreds of hours into that labor.
[00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:31.700]   most people, when they start reading a book, they invest at the very minimum hundreds of hours into that labor.
[00:42:31.720 --> 00:43:01.720]   You are taking in the absolute height, thus far, of human knowledge, of human achievement.
[00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:01.720]   You are standing on the shoulders not only of giants, you're standing on the shoulders of giants who are standing on the shoulders of giants who are standing on the shoulders of giants who are standing on the shoulders of giants who are standing on the shoulders of giants.
[00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:01.720]   In almost any field, if you read a nonfiction book that's well written, what you are receiving from that book is you are receiving
[00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:31.740]   a lot of information.
[00:43:31.740 --> 00:44:01.760]   and you're receiving a lot of information.
[00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:01.760]   That's what reading is.
[00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:01.760]   Here's what's incredible.
[00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:01.760]   You don't have to read just one book.
[00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:01.760]   Read ten.
[00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:01.760]   Any person in the world who has the basic intelligence to read at normal levels can easily read a book of weeks.
[00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:01.760]   So ten weeks from now you can have read ten books on whatever subject you're interested in. You can be a world-class expert in ten weeks.
[00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:01.760]   That's the first thing.
[00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:01.760]   That's the first thing.
