[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.880]   Well, it's better for us that Jesus is gone.
[00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.000]   He said so when he left.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.440]   But how so?
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:17.480]   Why is Christ's physical absence from us better for us than his physical presence with us?
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.240]   It's a wise theological question and it comes to us from a listener named Sam in the form
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.960]   of a question about the Holy Spirit.
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.700]   "Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.720]   Can you tell me why did Jesus have to leave before the Holy Spirit could come?
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.160]   The timing doesn't make sense to me.
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.320]   Couldn't the Spirit have come in full power while Christ was physically on earth with
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.360]   us?"
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:46.000]   This is a hugely helpful question because it causes me at least to step back, ask the
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.640]   bigger question of what is God doing in the world and why does he do it the way he does
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.640]   it?
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.600]   It's a huge question.
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.600]   So simple.
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:03.120]   It's obviously simple and yet, my oh my, does it shed enormous light on the very history
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.120]   of redemption.
[00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.120]   What is God doing?
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.200]   Why does he do it the way he does it?
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:18.320]   So Sam asks, "Couldn't the Spirit have come in full power while Christ was on earth?"
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.460]   And here's my answer.
[00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:32.160]   He could not have come in full Christ-exalting, gospel-applying, new covenant-fulfilling,
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:38.440]   deepest sin-convicting, Satan-defeating power while Jesus was on the earth.
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.440]   No.
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.120]   And the reason he couldn't is because every one of those hyphenated expressions, every
[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:50.920]   one of those expressions of power are all based upon the death and resurrection and
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.040]   ascension and rule of Jesus Christ.
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.740]   It had to be done.
[00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.680]   Those had to be done before the Holy Spirit could glorify them.
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:06.580]   In other words, the most basic ministry of the Holy Spirit in this age is the glorification
[00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:15.240]   of Jesus Christ crucified for sins, risen, triumphant over Satan, forgiving sins on the
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:21.560]   basis of the blood, ascended in triumph and kingly power in heaven, coming again.
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.240]   That's what the Holy Spirit glorifies.
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.200]   He couldn't glorify that until it happened.
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.180]   In other words, the Holy Spirit's ministry is not power in general.
[00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.580]   That's a mistake made in the question.
[00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.480]   It's not power in general.
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:46.740]   It's Christ-glorifying power, particularly glorifying the gospel or Christ crucified
[00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.680]   as we see it in the gospel and Christ risen.
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.520]   Now, let's see this.
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.640]   We can see this in the New Testament really clearly that what I'm saying is so.
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.000]   John 16, 7 following goes like this.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.860]   It says, "I tell you the truth, it is to your advantage that I go away.
[00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.840]   For if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you."
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.280]   Now, we should ask, "Why not?"
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.280]   And let's watch.
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.280]   Watch what he says.
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:24.360]   "But if I go, I will send him to you, and when he comes," here's what he's going
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:31.520]   to do, "he will convict the world concerning sin and righteousness and judgment."
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.680]   And then he unpacks what he means by those three things.
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.960]   Concerning sin, because they do not believe in me.
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.680]   Concerning righteousness, because I go to the Father, okay?
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.940]   I go to the Father and you will see me no longer.
[00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:56.480]   So there we see that the resurrection and the ascension show the world to be wrong,
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:03.000]   to be convicted about the justice of Jesus' crucifixion, namely they're guilty.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.160]   And the Holy Spirit's work is to make that clear after the resurrection.
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:14.680]   Verse 11, "Concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged."
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.640]   When did that happen?
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.760]   That judgment of Satan was accomplished in the death and resurrection of Jesus, Colossians
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:21.760]   2, 15.
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:28.000]   Here's verse 12, "I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:35.060]   When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all truth, namely the most important
[00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.640]   truths yet to be accomplished in my death and resurrection."
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:44.000]   Continuing, "For he will not speak on his own authority, but whatever he hears, he will
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.020]   speak and he will declare to you the things that are to come.
[00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.360]   He will glorify me."
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:57.640]   That is the most important sentence about the work of the Holy Spirit in the Bible.
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:09.340]   He will glorify me, namely, specifically me in my resurrection glory and my achievements
[00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.480]   over sin and Satan on the cross.
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:17.360]   That's the peak, the apex of the glory of Christ in the gospel.
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.080]   You can't glorify Christ for that if he hasn't done it.
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:28.000]   See it again, John 7, verse 37, following, "Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.820]   says, out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.
[00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:37.720]   Now this he said about the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were to receive.
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:44.720]   For as yet," this is a very perplexing text if you don't see what he's doing, "as yet
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.480]   the Spirit had not yet been given."
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:54.680]   The text says, "just has not been," because Jesus has not yet been glorified.
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:59.340]   Now we know that the Spirit was present in the ministry of Jesus.
[00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:02.960]   It was causing people to be born again in John 3.
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.200]   Jesus was doing his ministry in the power of the Holy Spirit.
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:10.800]   We know that the Holy Spirit was present in the Old Testament, overcoming the mind of
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:11.800]   the flesh.
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:20.000]   If you read Psalm 51 or Isaiah 53, he was overcoming the mind of the flesh, which according
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.200]   to Romans 8, 7, keeps you from pleasing God.
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:28.080]   We know saints pleased God in the Old Testament, which they can't do without the work of the
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.400]   Holy Spirit.
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.160]   So we know he was there.
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:41.880]   And he could not, however, powerfully do his most essential work, which was glorifying
[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:44.880]   the risen and crucified Christ.
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:49.880]   Here it is again in 2 Corinthians 3 and 4.
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.920]   Here's 3.18.
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:57.920]   We all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:02.280]   the same image from one degree of glory to another.
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:09.640]   And then Paul adds this, to our being changed into the likeness of Jesus by looking at him.
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:15.580]   He adds this, "For this comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit."
[00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:20.000]   So there's the most essential ministry of the Spirit.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:26.200]   He lifts the veil, he causes us to see the glory of Jesus Christ, and thus he transforms
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.360]   his church into the likeness of Jesus.
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.880]   Now where are we seeing that glory?
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:36.200]   Where are we seeing the glory of Christ as the Holy Spirit lifts the veil so that we
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.560]   can see and be transformed?
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.360]   And the answer, four verses later, is this.
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:44.480]   The God of this world, Satan, has blinded the minds of unbelievers to keep them from
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:52.760]   seeing—here it is—the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ.
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:59.880]   So the Spirit's role, in verse 18 of chapter 3, is to reveal the glory of Christ in the
[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:10.240]   gospel, which cannot be until Jesus is dead, buried, risen, raised, and reigning.
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:17.320]   That's the key work of the Holy Spirit that he could not do until Jesus was gone.
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:20.080]   Here's one last way to say it.
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:25.720]   The Holy Spirit's work is spelled out in the promise of the new covenant in Ezekiel
[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:34.040]   36-27 like this, "I will put my Spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and
[00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:36.240]   be careful to obey my rules."
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:42.320]   Now that is the work of the Holy Spirit, which we just saw happens by revealing the glory
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.320]   of Jesus Christ.
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:47.360]   That's his work in this age, right now.
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:55.400]   But Luke 22-20 makes clear that Jesus bought this work, secured this work, obtained this
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:09:00.080]   new covenant work by shedding his blood.
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:06.580]   This cup is poured out for you as the new covenant in my blood.
[00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:12.720]   So the work of the Holy Spirit in power—and that's what we're being asked, "Couldn't
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:17.320]   he come in power while Jesus is still here?"—the work of the Holy Spirit
[00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:24.520]   in new covenant power happens only on the basis of the blood of Jesus.
[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:29.600]   So I'll give my answer one more time, and maybe this time it'll make more sense.
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:37.400]   So Sam asks, "Couldn't the Spirit have come in full power while Christ was on the
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:38.400]   earth?"
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:39.400]   Here's my answer.
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:48.880]   He could not have come in full Christ-exalting, gospel-applying, new covenant-fulfilling,
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:54.920]   deepest sin-convicting—and that sin is the crucifixion of Jesus—deepest sin-convicting,
[00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:57.040]   Satan-defeating power.
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:05.240]   All of those aspects of the power of his ministry are based on the death, the resurrection,
[00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:10.680]   and the triumphant ascension of Jesus to God's right hand as King.
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:16.400]   Yeah, we get more of Christ in his absence through the Holy Spirit.
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:18.920]   And that's the beauty of the new covenant.
[00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:21.120]   Pastor John, thank you for those words.
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:24.920]   And just about everything you need to know about this podcast, you can find online at

[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:32.800]   Well young couples face a lot of questions.
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:34.280]   Can they use birth control?
[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:35.360]   Should they?
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:37.880]   Can the wife be the breadwinner in this season?
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:39.220]   Should she?
[00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:42.600]   Questions like these are faced by young couples in the transition years of finishing up school
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.840]   and launching into careers.
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:50.160]   And those two questions come to us as a package deal in one email that we'll address on Friday.
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:51.160]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:51.880]   We'll see you then.
