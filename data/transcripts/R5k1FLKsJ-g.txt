[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.960]   There's two categories of applications that link chain is really good at enabling.
[00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.060]   One is ones that basically personalize LLMs to your data.
[00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.120]   And this can be adding it as contextual information.
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.740]   So this can be like chat over your documents, chat over your SQL
[00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.460]   database, chat over your CSVs.
[00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.020]   It can also be personalized in the sense of like adding in few shot examples.
[00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.300]   There was a really good example by a student at Williams college that did
[00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.520]   one where it was using information around like rare kind of like diseases,
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.200]   basically that chat GPT just didn't know about, or didn't have
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.160]   like the depth of knowledge.
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.280]   And, and so it was grounding it in more specific focused literature on that.
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.780]   And the other type of applications, I think link chain is really good
[00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.540]   at enabling our genetic applications.
[00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.280]   So basically things where you use the language model as a reasoning
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.760]   engine and it decides what to do.
[00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.380]   And, and these involve tool usage and they also involve
[00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.700]   the contextual stuff as well.
[00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.600]   And it also involves a little bit of like memory and a genetic
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.960]   memory and remembering things.
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.160]   So one of the more creative applications, this isn't super heavy on the tool
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.040]   usage, but in terms of like deciding what to do next.
