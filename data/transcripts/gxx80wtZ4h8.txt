[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280]   [Silence]
[00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:04.920]   For those of you that enjoy alcohol,
[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.760]   I, again, I really like to say,
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.440]   I feel guilty about telling you this
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.880]   because I know how much some people enjoy a good drink
[00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:12.720]   every once in a while.
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:13.540]   And I say a good drink
[00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.080]   because some people do like the taste of alcohol.
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:16.960]   I suppose I lucked out
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.620]   and then I don't really like the taste of alcohol.
[00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:19.960]   And that just puts me to sleep,
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.560]   but I know that people do enjoy it.
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.560]   And I do want to point out that there is zero evidence
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.960]   that provided somebody is of drinking age,
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.200]   or certainly not in the stage of brain development,
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.720]   that having one drink or two drinks every now and again,
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.780]   meaning every three or four weeks or once a month,
[00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.380]   that is not going to cause major health concerns
[00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.960]   or major health issues for most people.
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.140]   I suppose if you have zero
[00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.000]   or very little alcohol dehydrogenase,
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.840]   it might make you feel sick,
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.200]   but then you're probably not the kind of person
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.120]   that's going to be drinking at all.
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.940]   So again, if you enjoy alcoholic drinks,
[00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.000]   I'm not trying to take them away from you by any means,
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.240]   but you should know what drinking does
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.640]   if you're consuming it in this kind of typical
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.520]   chronic pattern, as we can now refer to it,
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.760]   which is that one or two a night
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.520]   or a few stacked up on Friday
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.200]   and maybe three or four on Saturday,
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.240]   this kind of pattern of drinking, which is quite common.
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.760]   And one of the more serious effects
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.920]   that we should think about is the impact
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.360]   on the so-called gut brain axis,
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.160]   or for sake of today's discussion,
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.040]   the gut liver brain axis.
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.600]   I don't think the gut liver brain axis
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.160]   has ever been discussed on this podcast,
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.440]   maybe any podcast, although the moment I say that,
[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.680]   I'm going to, you know, the gut liver brain axis,
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.920]   people are going to come after me with,
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.280]   I suppose, gut, liver, brain, and brains.
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.040]   In any event, you have a brain, you have a gut.
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.160]   That gut runs from your throat
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.880]   down to the end of your intestine.
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.840]   Your gut and your brain communicate
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.200]   by way of nerve cells, neurons, and nerve connections,
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.080]   the vagus nerve in particular,
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.520]   and by way of chemical signaling.
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.200]   Your gut also communicates by way of chemical signaling,
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.960]   and believe it or not, by way of neural signaling too,
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.240]   to your liver.
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.680]   And as we talked about earlier,
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.640]   the liver is the first site in which alcohol
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.060]   is broken down and metabolized into its component parts.
[00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.120]   The liver is also communicating with the brain
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.760]   through chemical signaling and neural signaling.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.080]   So we have the gut liver brain axis.
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.720]   And what you find is that people who ingest alcohol
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.840]   at any amount are inducing a disruption
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.900]   in the so-called gut microbiome,
[00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.820]   the trillions of little micro bacteria
[00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.280]   that take resident in your gut
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.640]   and that live inside you all the time,
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.120]   and that help support your immune system,
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.760]   and that literally signal by way of electrical signals
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.780]   and chemical signals to your brain
[00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.960]   to increase the release of things like serotonin and dopamine
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.440]   and regulate your mood generally in positive ways.
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.840]   Well, alcohol really disrupts those bacteria.
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.000]   This should come as no surprise.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.320]   I mean, earlier we talked about this,
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.120]   and it's well-known if you want to sterilize something,
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.880]   you want to kill the bacteria, you pour alcohol on it.
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.680]   And I can remember scraping myself or cutting myself.
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.680]   I was always injuring myself when I was a kid.
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.320]   And the moment they take out the peroxide,
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.440]   you're like, "Oh boy, here it comes."
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.200]   But if there's no peroxide around
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.200]   and you've got a wound there and you need to clean it out,
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.780]   yeah, they'll use alcohol,
[00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.260]   which I do not recommend, by the way,
[00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.440]   and that's one of the harshest ways to clean a wound.
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.860]   But for centuries, thousands of years, really,
[00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.780]   alcohol has been used in order to clean things
[00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.460]   and kill bacteria.
[00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.540]   So alcohol kills bacteria, and it is indiscriminate
[00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.020]   with respect to which bacteria it kills.
[00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.260]   So when we ingest alcohol and it goes into our gut,
[00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.680]   it kills a lot of the healthy gut microbiota.
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.820]   At the same time, the metabolism of alcohol in the liver,
[00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.000]   which you now understand that pathway
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.360]   involving NAD, acetyl aldehyde, and acetate,
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.640]   that pathway is pro-inflammatory.
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.680]   So it's increasing the release of inflammatory cytokines,
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.640]   things like IL-6, et cetera, tumor necrosis factor alpha.
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.240]   If you'd like to learn more about the immune system,
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.320]   we did an episode all about the immune system.
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.800]   You can find it hubermanlab.com.
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.240]   It'll teach you all the basics of what are cytokines,
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.340]   what are mast cells, et cetera.
[00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.640]   In any event, all these pro-inflammatory molecules,
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.760]   those are being released.
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.180]   You've now got disruption of the gut microbiota.
[00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.360]   As a consequence, the lining of the gut is disrupted,
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.840]   and you develop at least transiently leaky gut.
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.260]   That is, bacteria that exist in the gut,
[00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:35.540]   which are bad bacteria,
[00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.640]   can now pass out of the gut into the bloodstream.
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.860]   So you've got a two-hit kind of model here.
[00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.260]   In biology, we talk about two-hit models.
[00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.800]   That is kind of a one plus one equals four.
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.120]   And it's generally when you hear two-hit,
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.560]   it's not a good thing.
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.840]   So you've got bad bacteria
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.100]   from partially broken down food moving out of the gut.
[00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.200]   The good bacteria in the gut have been killed.
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.600]   You might say, why doesn't the alcohol
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.800]   kill the bad bacteria in the gut?
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.800]   Well, the bad bacteria that are from partially digested food
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.240]   oftentimes escape the gut
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.240]   before the alcohol can disrupt them.
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.200]   And so now you've got leaks in the gut wall.
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.020]   You've got the release of this bad bacteria.
[00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.100]   You've got inflammatory cytokines
[00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.060]   and other things being released from the liver.
[00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.620]   And they are able to get into the brain
[00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.260]   through what's called a neuroimmune signaling.
[00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.700]   And what's really bizarre in terms of the way
[00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.580]   that this manifests in the brain,
[00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.680]   I mean, it's not the way I would have done it,
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.000]   but then again, as I always say,
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.500]   I wasn't consulted at the design phase.
[00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:34.520]   And anyone who says they did,
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.380]   you should be very skeptical of them.
[00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:40.860]   The net effect of this is actually to disrupt
[00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.240]   the neural circuits that control regulation
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.560]   of alcohol intake.
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.180]   And the net effect of that is increased alcohol consumption.
[00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:50.600]   So this is just terrible, right?
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.840]   I mean, you're taking in something
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.600]   that disrupts two systems, the gut microbiota,
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:56.680]   and it disrupts in two ways.
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.760]   It's killing the good gut microbiota,
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.660]   and it's allowing the bad bacteria
[00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.320]   to move from the gut into the bloodstream.
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.520]   You've also got pro-inflammatory cytokines
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:07.800]   coming from the liver.
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.900]   And those converge or arrive in the brain
[00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.100]   and create a system in which the neural circuits
[00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:16.940]   cause more drinking.
[00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:18.300]   That's a bad situation.
[00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.840]   And this is why people who drink regularly,
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.600]   even if it's not a ton of alcohol,
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.280]   again, of the sorts of patterns of drinking
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.120]   I talked about before,
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.400]   and certainly for those that are chronic heavy drinkers,
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.160]   what you end up with is a situation
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.780]   in which you have inflammation
[00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.800]   in multiple places in the brain and body,
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.160]   and the desire to drink even more
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.140]   and to further exacerbate that inflammation
[00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:40.920]   and the gut leakiness.
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.080]   So this is basically a terrible scenario
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.420]   for the gut-liver-brain axis.
[00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:46.720]   And it's especially prevalent
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.240]   in so-called alcohol use disorder.
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.240]   Again, people that are ingesting
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.760]   somewhere between 12 and 24 drinks per week.
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.560]   For those of you that are interested in learning more
[00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.040]   about the gut-liver-brain axis
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.920]   and in particular alcohol use disorder,
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.100]   I'll provide a link in the show note captions.
[00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:02.380]   And there's a wonderful review on this that details that.
[00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.280]   But on the positive side,
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.880]   it points to the possibility that at least some,
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.440]   again, at least some of the negative effects
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:10.480]   of alcohol consumption,
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:11.600]   whether or not you're somebody
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.800]   who's currently ingesting alcohol
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.120]   or who used to ingest alcohol
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.240]   and is trying to so-called repair these systems
[00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.360]   of the brain and body,
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.800]   whether or not replenishing the gut microbiota
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:21.680]   is going to be beneficial.
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.840]   And we know that there are ways to do that.
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.900]   And we know that there's at least some promise
[00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:28.640]   for the ability for the system to repair itself.
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:29.920]   How does one do that?
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:32.040]   Well, I've talked before about this on the podcast,
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:34.520]   but studies done by colleagues of mine at Stanford,
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:35.360]   Justin Sonnenberg,
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.880]   who's been on this podcast as a guest,
[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.960]   an amazing episode all about the gut microbiome
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.560]   and his collaborator, Chris Garner,
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.680]   also at Stanford School of Medicine,
[00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:45.640]   have explored not alcoholism,
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:49.680]   but what are ways to improve the gut microbiota
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:53.440]   in particular to reduce the production
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:55.320]   of inflammatory cytokines
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.360]   and to adjust what's called the inflammatome.
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.920]   You've heard of the genome and the proteome, et cetera.
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:03.720]   Well, the inflammatome is the total array
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:06.800]   or at least the near total array of genes and proteins
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.160]   that control inflammation.
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.600]   How can you reduce inflammation
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.000]   and make that inflammatome healthier?
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.840]   Well, they've shown that two to four servings
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:16.480]   of fermented foods per day,
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.520]   and here I'm not referring to fermented alcohol,
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.120]   I'm talking about low sugar fermented foods,
[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:23.400]   so things like kimchi, sauerkraut, natto,
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:26.800]   for those of you that like Japanese food.
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.160]   There are others, I know things like kefir,
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:32.440]   things like yogurts that have a lot of active bacteria,
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.960]   again, low sugar varieties of all these things.
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:39.920]   Those are terrific at reducing inflammatory markers
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:42.640]   and at improving the gut microbiome.
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:45.840]   One could imagine that either inoculating oneself
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:47.520]   from some of the effects of alcohol,
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:48.440]   although I'd prefer that people
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:51.360]   just not drink alcohol chronically, frankly,
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:54.020]   or if somebody is trying to repair their gut microbiome
[00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:56.360]   because they ingested a lot of alcohol
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.480]   or because they had a lot of these inflammatory cytokines
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:01.280]   for many years or even a short period of time,
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:03.440]   regular ingestion of two to four servings
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:06.700]   of these fermented foods can be quite beneficial.
[00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:10.040]   I want to make it clear that has not been examined
[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:14.000]   specifically in the context of alcohol use disorder,
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.480]   but because a huge component of the negative effects
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:19.560]   of alcohol use disorder are based
[00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:21.360]   in this gut-liver-brain axis and disruption
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.960]   of the gut microbiome and the inflammatory cytokines,
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:27.080]   it stands to reason that things that are well-established
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:29.800]   to improve inflammation status,
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.420]   in other words, reduce inflammation,
[00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:33.040]   such as ingesting two to four servings
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:35.020]   of low-sugar fermented foods per day,
[00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:38.320]   make sense in terms of trying to repair
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:40.080]   or replenish the system.
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.640]   One could also imagine taking probiotics or prebiotics.
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:44.640]   Certainly that would work as well,
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.640]   although I've sort of favored the discussion
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.480]   around fermented foods and replenishment
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:52.680]   of the gut microbiome, mostly because there are more studies
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:54.360]   that have examined that in humans
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.340]   and because of the direct relationship
[00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:57.980]   that's been established between doing that
[00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:01.280]   and reducing negative markers within the inflammatome.

[00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:07.280]   [upbeat music]
