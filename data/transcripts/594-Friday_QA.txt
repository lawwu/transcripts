[00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:37.220]   Today on Radical Personal Finance, it's Friday Q&A.
[00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:57.760]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with knowledge, skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while building a plan for the future.
[00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:26.640]  , and as with any Friday, I have a live Q&A call.
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.740]   That's where you can call in.
[00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.760]   You can talk to me about anything you want.
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.800]   You can ask questions about living a rich life, building financial freedom.
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.820]   You can make commentary, anything you want on a Friday show.
[00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.860]   I guess we could more commonly call it Open Line Friday.
[00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:26.940]   Again, anything you want is a great place to talk about anything you want.
[00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:27.020]   I'm going to be talking about the future of the future of the future.
[00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:57.040]  , if there's a subject that you have wanted to ask me about, a show topic that you've wanted to get my opinion on. A lot of times I find these Friday Q&A shows far less intimidating to do so people all the time send me show topics and they say Joshua what do I do about such and such and such a thing but if I create a standalone show that requires me to spend a bunch of time maybe a couple of hours putting together an outline and so I like to answer them extemporaneously sometimes because it allows me to possibly give you something useful or give you a couple of that you a couple of time.
[00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:27.060]   I can always say hey it was an impromptu speech. Of course it wasn't very good. If you would like to join me on a Friday Q&A show I would love to have you call in in the future. Here is the most reliable way of reaching me on those shows. Join the show at radicalpersonalfinance.com slash patron. Sign up to become a patron there at radicalpersonalfinance.com slash patron. That is always the first place that I go to and I have tried hard. Although my Patreon program has suffered over the years, I've been able to get a lot of support from people who have been supporting me on the show.
[00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.060]   My Patreon program has suffered over the years, I've been able to get a lot of support from people who have supported me on the show.
[00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:57.080]  , and as with many things it's had its fits and fizzles in time. But I've always tried to give good discount codes to the patrons and I've always tried to give huge or I've always tried to give as much access as possible to these Q&A calls and talking with patrons and if you're a patron of the show I want to say thank you. I probably don't say it as frequently as I should but thank you. I appreciate your support. It means and it has meant the world to me just to know that you're willing to put your money where you're willing to do your money and you're willing to do your money.
[00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:27.100]   I appreciate the opportunity to talk to you and I do enjoy your podcast and the work you're doing. I've got a kind of a question that I've not heard you talk about before but I do want to ask you a question.

[00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:32.520]  adata to the world. I think that being very conservative and very careful is important. So, I want my children, for example. I've always admired the testimony of Steve Maxwell with his children. Where by the time before his children married, they were able to pay cash for their house and be in a situation where they could pay cash for a house.
[00:14:57.740 --> 00:14:59.900]  obediently, I think. I think that's a really valid way to learn how to please his wife. Now, there's nothing morally right or wrong about owning a house versus renting a house. But if you look practically at it and you start to say, "Well, what could that do?" I personally really love the scripture from the biblical law in the Old Testament where, in Deuteronomy, I think, where it says, "If a soldier marries, he's not allowed to go to war during the first year of his marriage, but rather he needs to be able to stay at home and please his wife." I think that's a really valid way to learn how to please his wife.
[00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:28.260]   I think that's such a valuable principle.
[00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:29.260]   And I wish we embrace that more in modern Christian culture to say, for a newlywed, what can you do, especially in the first year of your marriage, to just simply be together with your new wife or your new husband?
[00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:59.280]  , and you can enjoy some of the richness of life. And I often wonder, well, we look at divorce statistics. So, of course, divorce is a great moral wrong, a great sin. So, if we look at divorce statistics, I've often wondered, well, what if we avoided the financial pressure? Because a lot of people report that financial pressures are significant factors on their way to divorce. What if we avoided that? Would that not lead to a great moral wrong?
[00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:00.320]   Would that not lead to greater health of marriages, greater permanence of marriages, etc.?
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:01.320]   So, practically speaking, I think we're well served to follow the path that you have followed.
[00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:02.320]   And, excuse me, I admire you for that, and I think it is good.
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:19.320]   Now, let me pause for a moment and ask you this.
[00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:24.060]   Can you imagine a circumstance in the future, given your convictions, given the way that
[00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:29.300]   you've lived the last 25 years, can you imagine a circumstance in the future in which you would
[00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:29.300]   in which you would choose to marry someone who is not your husband?
[00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:29.300]   In which you would choose to marry someone who is not your husband?
[00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:29.300]   In which you would choose to marry someone who is not your husband?

[00:16:59.320 --> 00:16:59.320]   In which you would choose to marry someone who is not your husband?
[00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:29.340]   I interviewed a businessman I met named Tim Yarborough.
[00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:29.340]   I interviewed a businessman I met named Tim Yarborough.
[00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:29.340]   One of the things that Tim Yarborough, he's in his late 60s,
[00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:29.340]   One of the things he said in that interview here on Radical Personal Finance was he said,
[00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:29.340]   He said, "If my wife and I, if we didn't have the money to pay for it, we wouldn't buy it."
[00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:29.340]   He said, "If we didn't have any money and we had to live in a tent, well, she would say, 'What color tent do we want to live in?' Because that's what we've got."
[00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:29.340]   I really admired him for that statement and it's always stuck with me since hearing him say that here in the show.

I would shop far and wide and I would make sure that as a component of it that you tried to find an insurance company, an insurance broker who would actually work with you. You can easily pull your driving record and you can easily pull your driving record and you can easily pull your driving record.
[00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:29.360]   1. I don't borrow money. I'm a very safe and conservative person. Here's my driving record. And you can fight for a company to underwrite you based upon them actually looking at you. And I think that's worth it. And then third, if you have to pay higher rates because you don't have a good credit score, then, well, you're saving money by not borrowing money. It angers me that there are so few companies that are willing to work with an individual. You know, they talk about the rise of the machine and how computers control us. I have experienced that.
[00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:59.380]   The only one thing that hurts you is car insurance and how you can't afford to pay for it. And I think that's a good thing.

[00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:29.440]   I say at this point, if you don't need a credit score, don't bother.
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:29.440]   It's a silly system.
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:29.440]   There's good things about it, but in many ways it's a silly system.
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:29.440]   Go now to Matt, North Carolina.
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:29.440]   Welcome to the show.
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:29.440]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:29.440]   Well, hey, Joshua, it's a pleasure to speak to you again.
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:29.440]   I guess I wanted to just lead off by asking how are you and your family enjoying life on the road?
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:29.440]   Is it treating you well?
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:29.440]   Yeah, I don't talk much about it, do I? I always get a little embarrassed, it's like too much self-promotion.
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:59.460]   and I just feel like well people would rather have you know would rather hear other things other than what the road is like versus you know but then I realize people are interested so thank you for teeing me up with a softball question to talk about myself yes we are enjoying the road it has been it has confirmed many of the many of the things that I previously thought so for example in past times and I've interviewed people who are longtime travelers I've always thought I've always said to them like what are you doing
[00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:29.480]   don't you think what's the point of of your travels and we have various goals we have been systematically fulfilling in our travels but sometimes I just kind of feel like I'm I'm wandering about and it's very different than being in one place part of a standard community where you can actually be still and able to able to produce you know to be able to make an impact in the community I think that's so important because those those community focused things are well they're they're very meaningful
