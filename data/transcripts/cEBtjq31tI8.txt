[00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.920]   Today on Grace To You...
[00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.000]   Are we just religious people?
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.600]   Are we just people who follow creeds?
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.000]   Are we just people who go through religious ceremonies?
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.720]   The true nature of believers is we are children of God.
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:14.720]   We cry, "Abba, Father."
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:20.120]   We speak to God as our personal Father because we are His everlasting children.
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:26.520]   What in the world makes us so embarrassed about the gospel?
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:54.480]   For I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.480]   Open your Bible, if you will, to the first chapter of the gospel.
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:03.540]   The Gospel of John, and we are continuing our wonderful journey through this glorious
[00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:10.960]   presentation of our Lord Jesus Christ who is introduced to us in this book in metaphoric
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:11.960]   language.
[00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:21.440]   He is presented to us, as John opens, as the Word, as the life, and as the light.
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.440]   Each of those is a way to speak of His deity.
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.440]   He is the Word because He is the communication of God.
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:37.960]   He is the life because He is the very eternal life itself who gives life to everything that
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.080]   lives.
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:47.320]   And He is the light because He is the one true illuminator who illuminates all spiritual
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.800]   reality.
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.920]   I want to read the opening of this gospel from verse 1 to 14.
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.640]   "So that you have it in mind.
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.280]   In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.460]   He was in the beginning with God.
[00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.180]   All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him nothing came into being that
[00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.200]   has come into being.
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.280]   In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.160]   The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overpower it.
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.440]   There came a man sent from God whose name was John.
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.240]   He came as a witness to testify about the light.
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.120]   So that all might believe through Him.
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.320]   He was not the light, but He came to testify about the light.
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.900]   There was the true light which coming into the world enlightens every man.
[00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.200]   He was in the world, and the world was made through Him, and the world did not know Him.
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.840]   He came to His own, and those who were His own did not receive Him.
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.020]   But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, even
[00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.200]   to those who believe in His name.
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.480]   They were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man,
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.040]   but of God.
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.420]   And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we saw His glory, glory as of the
[00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:13.760]   only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.020]   Apart from Him, there is no Word from God.
[00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.780]   Apart from Him, there is no life.
[00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.320]   And apart from Him, there is no true understanding.
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.160]   All is darkness.
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.940]   All is darkness.
[00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.600]   John has captured some very basic things, simple on the surface and yet profound to
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:40.200]   express who this person is that we call the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:47.800]   He is the living wave of divine power moving at infinite speed, shining brightly into the
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:54.300]   spiritual realm to illuminate all that is otherwise dark.
[00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.120]   The Word is the light.
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:01.000]   The life who is the light that overpowers the darkness.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.060]   The darkness, verse 5 says, cannot overpower the light.
[00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:15.000]   Our Lord Jesus Christ makes everything spiritual truly discernible and visible.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:22.120]   You see the way the spiritual realm truly is only in the light of Christ.
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.080]   Apart from Him, everything is dark.
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:35.020]   Even in the world of religion, the realm of religion, everything is dark without Christ.
[00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.700]   What He's doing here is identifying the light and He refers to it six times and He will
[00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:45.960]   refer to Christ as the light again as we will see in subsequent sections, even this morning,
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.240]   of the gospel of John.
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.680]   But what John is going to do in this opening chapter is to turn that light on some very
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.040]   essential foundations.
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:00.240]   He's going to turn that light on to the foundational, bottom line, bedrock spiritual truths.
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:06.180]   He's going to shine the light where the light initially needs to be placed in order for
[00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:11.020]   us to understand the foundational realities.
[00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:18.000]   The light of Christ will shine and reveal in this section the nature of true ministry.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.920]   The light will shine and reveal the very nature of the Savior Himself.
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.000]   The light will shine and reveal the very nature of the Savior Himself.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.500]   The light will shine and reveal the nature of sinners.
[00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:32.820]   It will shine and reveal the nature of believers and it will even illuminate the nature of
[00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.900]   God, all of that in this section.
[00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:40.480]   We will see the truth about Christian ministry, the truth about Christ Himself, the truth
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:46.840]   about sinners, the truth about believers, and the truth about God when the light shines
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.640]   and the light is none other than Christ.
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:54.960]   Now let's begin where John begins and talk, first of all, about the light of Christ.
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:00.260]   The light of Christ illuminating the true nature of ministry, the true nature of ministry,
[00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260]   gospel ministry.
[00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:07.680]   And this is first in John's order, so we accept that as having been inspired by the Holy Spirit.
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:12.080]   There came a man sent from God whose name was John.
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:18.140]   He came as a witness, or for a witness, to testify about the light so that all might
[00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:19.440]   believe through him.
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:24.920]   He was not the light, but he came to testify about the light.
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:30.760]   John, the essence of gospel ministry, which is the responsibility of every preacher, every
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:38.500]   believer, we're all to be giving a witness to Christ, the essence of the nature of gospel
[00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:44.440]   ministry is right there established for us at the very beginning of this gospel.
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:50.500]   Since the purpose of it is evangelistic, this is critical to John, that we understand the
[00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:54.880]   nature of Christian ministry and why we are as believers in the world.
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:01.540]   And why some of us preach and what is to be the theme of our preaching.
[00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:06.460]   But let's back up and start at verse 6 and we'll run from verse 6 through 13.
[00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:08.180]   The change is very abrupt here.
[00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:09.960]   There came a man.
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:10.960]   Just mark that.
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.480]   There came a man.
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:19.320]   Up to this point, we've been in verses 1 through 5 and we've been talking about the uncreated
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:24.840]   one, the eternal one who in the beginning existed already.
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:32.700]   Was with God, that is, was with God, distinct from God, and yet was God.
[00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:37.220]   He is the one who created everything that exists and nothing has come into existence
[00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:39.040]   that He didn't create.
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:43.380]   He is life itself and gives that life and He is light.
[00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:49.020]   So we've been talking about the eternal Son of God, the second member of the Trinity.
[00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:54.380]   Verse 14 says, "Who became flesh and dwelt among us."
[00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:59.880]   We saw His glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth.
[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:02.720]   So we've been talking about God who became a man.
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.980]   Now we have a shift in verse 6.
[00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:07.320]   There came a man.
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.040]   There came a man.
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:15.820]   We move from the uncreated one, the Creator, the eternal one, pre-existent, co-existent
[00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:24.340]   with God, self-existent, that is, life is in Him, to a mere man, from a man named John.
[00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:26.400]   Another man named John.
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.320]   John means gift of God.
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.660]   And John the Apostle is the writer.
[00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:33.820]   But here he's referring to a different John.
[00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:38.620]   There came a man sent from God whose name was John.
[00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:40.540]   He's not talking about himself.
[00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:46.120]   He's talking about John the Baptist as we know him because of his ministry of baptizing
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:51.620]   people in the Jordan River who had come to him to hear that Messiah was coming and they
[00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:54.300]   needed to repent and get their hearts right.
[00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:59.740]   And to symbolize their desire to be washed and cleansed from sin, John put them through
[00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:04.740]   a baptism, which was really what they did to Gentiles who were outside the covenant
[00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:09.140]   when they wanted to become a part of worshiping the true God and become a part of the religion
[00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:10.700]   of Israel.
[00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:14.740]   And his ministry is defined in verse 7 in very simple terms.
[00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:24.260]   He came for a witness to testify about the light so that all might believe through Him.
[00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:30.360]   In that one verse, verse 7, you have the model for gospel ministry...the model for
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.580]   gospel ministry.
[00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:33.980]   John lays this down at the very outset.
[00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:40.220]   If his purpose, and it is, is to cause people to believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son
[00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:46.260]   of God, and believing have life in His name, then that becomes the mission of every true
[00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.560]   believer and every true preacher.
[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:54.220]   And here John sets the foundation for that kind of ministry.
[00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:59.760]   He comes, verse 7, as a witness, or for a witness.
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:01.320]   He comes for a witness.
[00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:05.700]   If you read it, "He came as a witness," it makes the word "witness" seem like it's referring
[00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:08.800]   to the man, but it isn't.
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:14.240]   He came for a witness is a better way to translate it because the Greek is not a person but the
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:18.740]   message, marturia , the message.
[00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:22.120]   He came for a message.
[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:24.080]   That's why He came.
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:31.040]   He came as a man who had the true evidence from heaven regarding the light.
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:39.220]   He had the facts by which to give the message, the testimony to the court of the world so
[00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:43.460]   that they would understand the truth about the light.
[00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:46.680]   Notice about the light...about the light.
[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:49.180]   I can't emphasize that enough.
[00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:51.380]   Gospel ministry is about the light.
[00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:53.440]   It is about Christ.
[00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:53.940]   All truth.
[00:10:53.940 --> 00:11:01.740]   True Christian ministry is established here as being Christ-dominated, Christ-centered.
[00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:05.680]   This is the true nature of Christian ministry.
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:08.780]   It is about Jesus Christ.
[00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:11.100]   John points people to the Savior.
[00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:15.400]   Down in verse 15, John is giving his testimony.
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:20.060]   He's crying out, shouting at the top of his voice, "This was He of whom I said, 'He who
[00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:23.800]   comes after me has a higher rank than I, for He existed before me.'"
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:27.560]   He who comes after me existed before me.
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:34.320]   So He is talking about the One who though man is also the eternal God.
[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.640]   Christ is our subject.
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.280]   Christ is our theme.
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:38.500]   There is no other subject.
[00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:41.380]   There is no other theme.
[00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:48.160]   And just to deny any confusion, in verse 8, John the Apostle says that John the Baptist
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:53.660]   was not the light, but he came to testify about the light.
[00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:55.320]   That's what true preachers do.
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:57.420]   That's what true ministers do.
[00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:59.480]   That's what true believers do.
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:07.640]   So at the very start of this wonderful gospel, John illuminates the nature of true gospel
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:08.640]   ministry.
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:15.780]   All true ministers, faithful witnesses center on the evidences and the facts concerning
[00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:23.520]   the person and work of Christ to make the case that He is who the Scripture says He
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:25.280]   is.
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:31.980]   That's the theme of all preaching by all obedient, loyal, faithful ministers and Christian
[00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:32.980]   witnesses.
[00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:35.420]   Why do we need to do that?
[00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:40.640]   Because if they don't hear the gospel, they can't be saved.
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:44.000]   So John is a model.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:53.380]   John came for a witness to give testimony about the Lord Jesus Christ so that all might
[00:12:53.380 --> 00:13:02.860]   believe through His preaching, through His ministry.
[00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:10.100]   People come to salvation by believing preachers, by believing the evidence they present, by
[00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:16.620]   believing other Christians who have taken the gospel to them and explained it and given
[00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:18.940]   the facts and supported it.
[00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:23.240]   So the light is shining, first of all, in this foundation.
[00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:26.740]   There's a foundational passage in John on the nature of true ministry.
[00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:31.020]   Secondly, the light illuminates the nature of the Son of God, the true nature of the
[00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:32.720]   Son of God.
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:35.980]   We would know from the Old Testament, the second member of the Trinity, we would know
[00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:42.760]   the Trinity because we see all three persons of the Trinity engaged in the Old Testament.
[00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:47.940]   We would know that there is a relationship between the members of the Trinity.
[00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:50.560]   There are conversations between the members of the Trinity.
[00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:53.100]   The Lord said unto my Lord, for example, in the Psalms.
[00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:58.060]   We would know something about the nature of God because His attributes are disclosed
[00:13:58.060 --> 00:13:59.060]   in the Old Testament.
[00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:01.500]   We know a lot about Him.
[00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:08.260]   But there would be a measure of darkness until the light appears.
[00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:11.660]   And the light illuminates Himself.
[00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:17.600]   The light shines to reveal the very light itself, the very essence of Christ.
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:22.960]   And what we learn in verse 9 is, "There was the true light which coming into the
[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:27.600]   world, the world enlightens every man."
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:33.020]   When Christ arrived, now the second member of the Trinity becomes clear to us.
[00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:35.620]   Now we see who He is.
[00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:39.880]   We know from the New Testament that He was working in the Old Testament, that He was
[00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:45.480]   a spiritual rock, for example, that brought water to the children of Israel in the wilderness.
[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:52.820]   We know that He is the Savior of Isaiah 52 and 53, the one who would be our substitute.
[00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:58.280]   But there's still shadow around that until we come into the New Testament and the light
[00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:03.060]   arriving illuminates Himself.
[00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:08.700]   And we see the light of the glory of God like never before shining in the face of Jesus
[00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:11.000]   Christ.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.940]   The light shines then on the true nature of gospel ministry and it shines on the light
[00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:19.240]   itself.
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:20.960]   He is the true light.
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:22.680]   We see that.
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:31.840]   Preeminent, all-glorious, emanation from God, the glory of God shines in Him more brilliantly
[00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:40.360]   than in any other revelation and consequently enlightens every man who sees Him for who He
[00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:41.360]   is.
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:44.980]   What does it mean, "enlightens every man"?
[00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:51.200]   What it means is for every man who truly sees Christ, there is complete enlightenment about
[00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:52.540]   who He is.
[00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:56.740]   Not available in the Old Testament.
[00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:59.200]   Not available.
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:09.500]   No one really could see the full glory of Christ until He came into the world.
[00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:11.500]   He enlightens every man.
[00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:14.760]   He is the only light for every man.
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:17.780]   Everyone who is enlightened is enlightened by Him.
[00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:22.400]   Everybody who understands salvation and His role as Savior.
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:27.960]   Everyone who understands that understands it because they see Him for who He is.
[00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:31.240]   You can't be saved apart from Christ.
[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:36.080]   He says in John 8:12, "I am the light of the world.
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:41.100]   No man who follows Me will ever walk in darkness."
[00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:44.200]   The only light the world has is Christ.
[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:49.840]   He is the only light that can enlighten anyone and everyone.
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:52.260]   His light is the only sufficient light.
[00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:55.780]   How did He manifest Himself?
[00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:58.020]   Verse 10, "He was in the world."
[00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:01.360]   He was in the world.
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:02.960]   He was in the world that He made.
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:03.960]   The world was made by Him.
[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:04.960]   He was in the world.
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:07.720]   For 33 years He was present in His creation.
[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:13.120]   For 30 years in Nazareth, the people had Him in their neighborhood and the first time He
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:18.380]   came back to preach, they tried to kill Him...tried to kill Him.
[00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:22.120]   For three years He ministered in the land of Israel.
[00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:28.400]   He saved Israel, banished illness, banished demons, demonstrated His power over nature.
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:33.020]   He was the mystery of godliness, God in human flesh.
[00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:36.140]   He was the invisible God made visible.
[00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:40.700]   So the coming of Christ then enlightens us about the nature of spiritual ministry and
[00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:46.120]   enlightens us about the nature of the Savior Himself.
[00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:51.980]   Thirdly, Christ coming into the world as the light illuminated the true nature of sinners,
[00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:53.120]   the true nature of sinners.
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:58.120]   In order to get the gospel in your mind and understand its urgency and importance and
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:03.880]   understand the truth about how it operates, you have to see this third point.
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:10.160]   John makes this unmistakably clear and you will probably recall these verses by memory.
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:14.420]   Back to the middle of verse 10, "The world did not know Him.
[00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:18.840]   He came to His own and those who were His own did not receive Him."
[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:20.560]   Look.
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:25.760]   We understand that men are sinners, that the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately
[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:26.900]   wicked is not new.
[00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:30.060]   That's Jeremiah 17:9, way back.
[00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:36.080]   But never, never has that wretchedness and the profound nature of that darkness been
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:42.280]   more on display than when people reject the light.
[00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:46.500]   It's one thing to reject the light of the Law.
[00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:50.420]   It's another thing to reject the Word of Old Testament prophets.
[00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:55.060]   It's another thing to reject the revelation of God written in the Old Testament.
[00:18:55.060 --> 00:19:03.560]   But it is a far more indicative thing to reject Christ.
[00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:10.060]   This is incomparable testimony to the depravity of man.
[00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:18.300]   Put the blazing light of heaven full of grace, full of truth in the world of sinners and when
[00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:20.280]   they reject Him, you will have these words.
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:21.280]   "The world did not know Him."
[00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:25.480]   This is the key, most dramatic evidence of the depth of their depravity.
[00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:28.360]   Verse 10 says, "The world didn't know Him."
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:30.820]   And it even goes beyond that.
[00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:34.120]   In verse 11, "He came to His own."
[00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:35.120]   What do you mean His own?
[00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:42.300]   Well, it means His own place, His own people, His own country, His own nation, His own town.
[00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:45.920]   And those who were His own did not receive Him.
[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:48.340]   It wasn't just the world that didn't know Him.
[00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:49.380]   The Gentile world.
[00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:50.280]   The outside world.
[00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:52.500]   The Gentile world, continuing even to today.
[00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:58.280]   It was the very people who claimed to believe in the true God of Israel, the God of Abraham,
[00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.520]   Isaac and Jacob, the God of the Old Testament.
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:03.800]   It was the most religious people on the planet.
[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:06.380]   How deep is depravity?
[00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:11.600]   The greatest illustration of human depravity in history is the Jewish rejection of Christ
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:13.360]   when He was here.
[00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:18.460]   There is nothing parallel to that, nothing.
[00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:20.140]   He came to His own.
[00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:23.840]   And His own did not receive Him.
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:29.880]   There is a fourth illumination.
[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:35.960]   The light illuminated the truth regarding gospel ministry, regarding the Savior Himself,
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:36.960]   regarding sinners.
[00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:41.400]   And fourthly, the light illuminated the true nature of believers.
[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:48.800]   Just briefly on this, verse 12 tells us the plan was not thwarted in spite of the world's
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:49.800]   rejection.
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:52.300]   The rejection of Israel.
[00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:55.740]   But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, even
[00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:57.560]   to those who believe in His name.
[00:20:57.560 --> 00:20:58.780]   What does it mean to receive Him?
[00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:00.220]   It means to believe.
[00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:01.220]   There are parallels.
[00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:04.920]   As many as received Him, to those who believe in His name.
[00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:06.620]   To believe in His name is to receive Him.
[00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:08.140]   To receive Him is to believe in His name.
[00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:11.340]   To believe in His name is to believe in what His name means.
[00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:15.200]   And it means all that He is.
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:17.360]   There will be some who will believe.
[00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:19.660]   The word "but" is a small, powerful fulcrum.
[00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:24.240]   It makes a dramatic shift from the previous unbelief.
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:31.240]   But as many as received Him or believed in Him, He gave the privilege to become children
[00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:32.240]   of God.
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:34.260]   And that's the true nature of believers.
[00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:35.260]   What are we?
[00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:36.840]   Are we just religious people?
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:39.360]   Are we just people who follow creeds?
[00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:42.060]   We just people who go through religious ceremonies?
[00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:45.520]   Are we just people who have a certain moral code that we live up to?
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:46.520]   No.
[00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:49.520]   The true nature of believers is we are children.
[00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:50.520]   We are children of God.
[00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:55.500]   And you don't find that really clearly indicated in the Old Testament because the people in
[00:21:55.500 --> 00:22:00.300]   the Old Testament would only call God Father in a creative sense, not in an intimate personal
[00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:01.300]   sense.
[00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:03.340]   But we cry, "Abba, Father."
[00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:09.020]   We speak to God as our personal Father because we are His everlasting children.
[00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:15.580]   Because we received Christ and believed in Him, believing in the three Latin words "sense,"
[00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:19.380]   "notitia," we know the truth, "asensis," we ascend to the truth.
[00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:23.620]   "Fiducia," we trust in the truth.
[00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:27.800]   And we put our destiny in the hands of the One in whom we believe.
[00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:31.320]   We believe in His name.
[00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:34.840]   And therefore, we have the privilege to become.
[00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:36.340]   There's that creative word again.
[00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:38.440]   To be, being, is eternal.
[00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:41.560]   To become is in time, to be created.
[00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:44.120]   So what happens is we will be created again.
[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:49.240]   We were created physically and as believers in Him, we have become.
[00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:51.180]   We have become children.
[00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:53.360]   We have been created as spiritual children.
[00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:55.240]   This is the second creation.
[00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:59.580]   That's why it's called the new birth, or being born again, or being born from above as we'll
[00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:01.780]   see in John 3.
[00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:06.900]   Christ creates us anew.
[00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:10.500]   Second birth, regeneration.
[00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:17.200]   So the true nature of a believer, not a follower of somebody in the sense of a student, not
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:19.100]   a person who is guided by a moralist.
[00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:21.060]   Not a moral code or an ethical system.
[00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:30.580]   But the true nature of a believer is that he is a new creation, a child of God, everlastingly
[00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:32.500]   true.
[00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:40.960]   So John, one by one, shines the light of Christ to illuminate the nature of ministry, to illuminate
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:46.080]   the Savior Himself, to illuminate the condition of sinners, to illuminate the nature of believers.
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:47.980]   And one more.
[00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:48.960]   This is a big subject.
[00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:51.900]   But I'm just going to make quick reference to it.
[00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:57.340]   The light coming into the world also illuminated the true nature of God, the true nature of
[00:23:57.340 --> 00:23:59.360]   God.
[00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:04.980]   If men are as sinful as they are, if they are as wretched as they are, if they love
[00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:11.880]   the darkness as they do, if they're spiritually dead and spiritually blind, how can they possibly
[00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:13.220]   believe?
[00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:15.720]   How can they possibly receive Christ?
[00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:18.820]   How can they possibly become children of God?
[00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:21.900]   How can they possibly be born again?
[00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:23.820]   How can it happen?
[00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:28.620]   Verse 13, here we look into the very nature of God.
[00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:30.760]   Who were born?
[00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:32.240]   To be a child, you have to be born.
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:34.220]   This is that new birth, regeneration.
[00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:35.440]   Who were born?
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:36.440]   Not of blood.
[00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:38.440]   You know what that means?
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:41.740]   Heritage, descent.
[00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:46.100]   Doesn't come down from your ancestors.
[00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:47.940]   That's not how you become a child of God.
[00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:48.680]   Not because of...you know what that means?
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:53.160]   Not because of your parents or your grandparents or your family.
[00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:55.500]   Nor of the will of the flesh.
[00:24:55.500 --> 00:25:01.780]   Not because of personal effort, personal moral effort, personal spiritual effort, personal
[00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:04.440]   religious activity.
[00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:06.080]   Nor of the will of man.
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:07.180]   What does that mean?
[00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:13.980]   The acts of others, some sacramental system, some system of religion plied by so-called
[00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:16.280]   priests on your behalf.
[00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:18.540]   You're not going to become a child of God.
[00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:22.440]   By family heritage, you're not going to become a child of God.
[00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:29.760]   By personal effort, you're not going to become a child of God by some man-made system.
[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:32.260]   All impossible.
[00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:34.320]   How?
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:40.360]   You were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:43.400]   of God.
[00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:46.460]   Only God can do this miracle.
[00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:48.400]   And here we are introduced to the truth.
[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:54.300]   To the true nature of God with regard to the gospel, God is by nature a Savior.
[00:25:54.300 --> 00:26:00.460]   God who is the Savior of all men, especially those who believe.
[00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:02.140]   He is a saving God.
[00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:05.180]   Who is a pardoning God like you?
[00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:07.040]   Read Ezekiel 36 and 37.
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:09.460]   God presents the new covenant of salvation.
[00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:11.040]   Read Jeremiah 31.
[00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:13.580]   God is by nature a Savior.
[00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:17.500]   It's in His heart to give life to dead sinners.
[00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:23.000]   This is what we need to know as the foundation, the bedrock essentials for Christians.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   We need to know that God by nature is a saving God who gives life to dead sinners.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:36.140]   We need to know that believers are those who become by new creation eternal children of
[00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:37.620]   God.
[00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:43.880]   We need to know that sinners are deep in blindness and darkness and flee the light.
[00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:47.360]   We need to know that Christ is the only true light.
[00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:48.360]   We need to know that Christ is the only true light.
[00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:49.360]   We need to know that Christ is the only true light.
[00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:50.360]   We need to know that Christ is the only true light.
[00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:51.360]   We need to know that Christ is the only true light.
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:52.360]   We need to know that Christ is the only true light.
[00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:53.360]   We need to know that Christ is the only true light.
[00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:54.360]   We need to know that Christ is the only true light.
[00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:55.360]   We need to know that Christ is the only true light.
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:56.360]   We need to know that Christ is the only true light.
[00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:57.360]   We need to know that Christ is the only true light.
[00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:58.360]   We need to know that Christ is the only true light.
[00:26:58.360 --> 00:26:59.360]   We need to know that Christ is the only true light.
[00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:00.360]   We need to know that Christ is the only true light.
[00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:01.360]   We need to know that Christ is the only true light.
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:02.360]   We need to know that Christ is the only true light.
[00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:09.140]   John MacArthur took us through the complexity of one simple word: light.
[00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:12.680]   Jesus Christ is the light of the world.
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:14.660]   And the light illuminates the darkness.
[00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:18.500]   It creates clarity, reveals a path for us to follow.
[00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:23.240]   But specifically, it unveils four elements about the world.
[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:26.480]   One, what gospel ministry is supposed to look like.
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:30.720]   Two, the nature of the Savior Jesus Christ, who he is.
[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:32.220]   Three, the true nature of Jesus.
[00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:34.300]   Four, the nature of every person walking this earth.
[00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:36.000]   Or the nature of sinners.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:41.560]   And four, the nature of believers and how their life is characterized and separate because
[00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:43.200]   of God.
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:49.100]   If you recognize the lack of Jesus Christ, the divine light in your life, or you are
[00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:54.660]   curious to know more about who he is, I encourage you to read John MacArthur's The Jesus Answer
[00:27:54.660 --> 00:28:00.580]   Book, a short work in which John spends time answering the most questioned aspects of who
[00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:02.080]   Jesus Christ is.
