[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.500]   Going into the Nuggets, like, I didn't really follow the NBA all that much before I got to the NBA.
[00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.200]   So I didn't really know much about Nicola, honestly.
[00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.160]   I really did not.
[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.360]   And he wasn't the superstar he is now when I first got drafted.
[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.020]   When you get there, do you see he has the bag to be that player, though?
[00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:16.920]   I really didn't see it at first.
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.620]   Like, even when we went into training camp, I remember, like, asking my teammates.
[00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.080]   Everybody keeps telling me he's that cold.
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.260]   But in training camp, like, him and Mason Plumlee, our backup center, were, like, kind of going head-to-head.
[00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.480]   And they were like, no, Mike, like, wait till the real games come.
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:29.900]   You're going to see, like, this dude's a problem.
[00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.100]   But I didn't see it at first.
[00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.520]   But I quickly found out that he, no, he is the best player in the world.
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.940]   And I got to play alongside of him for those years.
[00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.460]   And it was amazing to learn from him.
