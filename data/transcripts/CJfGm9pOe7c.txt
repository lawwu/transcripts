[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.160]   Today's question is from a listener to the podcast named Jessica.
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.400]   She's locked in a debate with her father over the role of personal holiness in the Christian
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.400]   life.
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.220]   "Hello Pastor John, I have a hard question and I know you have a great answer for me.
[00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.800]   My father believes that when Christ died, he died for all of our sins.
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.600]   This I agree with, but he concludes this also means that when you have faith and accept
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:31.600]   Christ in your heart, you are then free to live however you want to, including being
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.960]   loose with and living in sin.
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.440]   I know this is wrong, but I'm having a hard time explaining this to my father.
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.900]   Can you help articulate this for me from the Bible?"
[00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:51.640]   As Paul concluded the great fifth chapter of Romans, he wrote, "The law came in to increase
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:01:02.560]   the trespass, but where sin increased, grace abounded all the more, so that as sin reigned
[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:12.160]   in death, grace also might reign through righteousness, leading to eternal life through Jesus Christ
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.160]   our Lord."
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.080]   That's Romans 5, 20 and 21.
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.320]   Then as soon as he finishes saying that, someone, perhaps having the same view that
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:29.280]   your father seems to hold, said, "Well, if grace abounds where sin increases, then
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.680]   our salvation certainly does not depend on fighting sin.
[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.760]   In fact, let us sin so that grace may abound."
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:43.960]   Now, here's Paul's response to this person and perhaps to your father in Romans 6, 1.
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.280]   He says, "What should we say then?
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.760]   Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound?"
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.840]   And he says, "By no means."
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.640]   Now what will Paul give as a reason for why he says, "By no means"?
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.720]   Will he just say, "Don't continue in sin because you just shouldn't.
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.960]   It's bad.
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.440]   It's against God's will.
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.500]   No, it's not a salvation issue, but just don't do it."
[00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.360]   Is that what he's going to say?
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.360]   Well no.
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.360]   Here's what he says.
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:21.080]   He argues like this, "Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound?
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.960]   By no means.
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:28.040]   How can we who died to sin still live in it?"
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.480]   That's what he says.
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.840]   So what's the reason that he gives for saying, "Don't go on sinning"?
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.800]   His reason is, "Dead people don't sin."
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.320]   How can we who died to sin still live in it?
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.320]   We can't.
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.320]   We can't.
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.320]   We died to sin.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:51.720]   You can't go on practicing sin if you are a Christian and have died with Christ to sin.
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.440]   So here's the issue that your dad does not seem to be facing.
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:04.000]   Of course, when Christ died, he paid the full price for all my sins.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.160]   All of them.
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:12.880]   There is no condemnation ever, forever, for those who are in Christ Jesus.
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.280]   Romans 8.1.
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:21.560]   But the question is, do those who are in Christ Jesus go on living in sin?
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:22.920]   That's the question.
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:30.720]   Over and over, the New Testament's answer is, if you go on living in sin, that is, if
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:38.240]   sin is your pattern of life and you do not make war on your sin, but instead you make
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:45.120]   peace with your sin, you have no warrant to believe that you are in Christ.
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.360]   This doesn't mean that you can lose your salvation.
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:55.140]   It means that your life can show you never had it, even though you looked like you had
[00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.520]   it for a time.
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:02.560]   That's why John said in 1 John 2.19, "They went out from us because they were not of
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.760]   us.
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.320]   For if they had been of us, they would have continued with us, but they went out that
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.540]   it might be complained that they were not of us."
[00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:18.680]   In other words, those who are truly in Christ persevere in faith and fight their sin and
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:24.480]   grow in holiness, and those who walk away into sin never were in Christ.
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:30.240]   It also doesn't mean that keeping ourselves saved depends finally on us.
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.800]   Paul said, "I am sure of this, that he who began a good work in you will bring it to
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.960]   completion at the day of Christ."
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:42.040]   And he said, "Christ will sustain you to the end, guiltless, in the day of the Lord
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.040]   Jesus.
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.120]   God is faithful, by whom you were called into the fellowship of his Son."
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.640]   In other words, we don't keep ourselves saved.
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:57.120]   God keeps us saved by the way he works in us, by the Spirit according to his call.
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:08.320]   But the pervasive witness of the New Testament is that God keeps us saved through sanctification.
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:16.120]   That is, he keeps us by leading us to fight sin and grow in holiness.
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.520]   That's how he keeps us saved.
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.360]   Here's the key verse.
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:32.080]   2 Thessalonians 2 verse 13, God chose you as the firstfruits to be saved through sanctification
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:37.800]   by the Spirit and through belief in the truth.
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:45.120]   Sanctification—that is, progressive making war on sin, progressive growth in holiness,
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:52.240]   leading sin, pursuing righteousness—sanctification is not an add-on to salvation.
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:58.320]   It is the way God saves, preserves us, brings us to glory.
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.360]   Here's the way Paul describes this work in Romans 8:13.
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.220]   "If you live according to the flesh, you will die.
[00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:11.360]   But if by the Spirit," he's talking to professing Christians, "you will put to
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.560]   death the deeds of the body, and you will live."
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:15.560]   Why?
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:20.640]   Because all who are led by the Spirit of God are the sons of God.
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.840]   That's how we know we are the sons of God.
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.640]   We are led by the Spirit.
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.600]   And where does he lead?
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:33.340]   In this text, he leads us into mortal combat with our own sin.
[00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:36.160]   That's the meaning of "lead" in this verse.
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:43.480]   If you put to death the deeds of the body by the Spirit, led by the Spirit, into war,
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:44.480]   you will live.
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:51.000]   If you don't, you won't live, which means that your dad is very wrong to say that we
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:57.440]   can live in sin and still be assured of our salvation.
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:02.480]   Holiness is the mark of those who are in Christ.
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:05.000]   Here's the way Hebrews 12:14 puts it.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:13.440]   "Strive for the holiness without which no one will see the Lord."
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:20.960]   This is not our imputed righteousness, which we have by union with Christ through faith.
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:26.760]   This is the kind of righteousness that you pursue, you strive for.
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:31.200]   Strive for the holiness without which no one will see the Lord.
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:39.200]   This strived-for righteousness does not add to the ground of our acceptance.
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.080]   The righteousness of Christ is the ground.
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:50.280]   Rather, it confirms the ground of our acceptance as Jesus Christ and our participation in him
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.280]   by faith.
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:59.160]   That's what 2 Peter 1:9 means when it says, "Therefore, brothers, be all the more diligent
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:07.680]   to confirm"—there's that word, so important—"to confirm your calling and election.
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:13.880]   For if you practice these qualities, you will never fall, because you'll be confirming
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.920]   that you are in Christ, who is your righteousness."
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:24.600]   In other words, sanctification does not save us by replacing our justification.
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:30.160]   It saves us by confirming our justification.
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:37.640]   As far as I can tell, Jessica, your dad does not believe that our justification by faith
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:41.960]   needs to be confirmed with a life of holiness.
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:43.680]   He seems not to believe that.
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:51.520]   He seems to have ideas about salvation, which both James and John wrote about in their letters.
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:58.760]   For example, James said in 2:14, "What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:02.880]   faith but does not have works?
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:05.720]   Can that faith save him?
[00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:06.880]   No.
[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:15.120]   So also faith"—I'm still reading—verse 17, "So also faith by itself, if it does
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:19.040]   not have works, is dead."
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:27.600]   In other words, the only kind of faith that saves is the kind that leads us to fight sin
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.720]   and practice the obedience of faith.
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:32.360]   Here's the way John said it in his letter.
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:37.720]   In fact, I think 1 John was written for your dad, because there are a lot of folks around
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:43.000]   like that, and John knew them, and he wrote this first letter, his first letter for them.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:50.280]   He says, chapter 5, verse 18, "We know that everyone who has been born of God does not
[00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:52.720]   keep on sinning."
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.720]   Doesn't make a practice of sinning.
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.320]   Doesn't make peace with sinning.
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:58.480]   Doesn't have a life of sinning.
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:03.440]   First John 3, 6, "No one who abides in him keeps on sinning.
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:08.360]   No one who keeps on sinning has either seen him or known him."
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:15.000]   Chapter 2, verse 3, "By this we know that we have come to know him, if we keep his commandments."
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:21.560]   First John 3, 14, "We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the
[00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:22.560]   brothers.
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:25.920]   Whoever does not love abides in death."
[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:35.080]   So Jessica, the way I suggest that you say it to yourself, to your dad, is, "We are justified
[00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:41.960]   by faith alone, but the faith that justifies is never alone.
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:45.920]   It causes us to hate sin and to fight it."
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:55.160]   So our holiness confirms that we are truly justified, truly in Christ.
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:59.480]   Confirmation does not replace justification.
[00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.280]   It confirms it.
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:06.760]   And that confirmation is necessary, not optional.
[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:09.320]   Pursue the holiness.
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:15.840]   You might even plead this with your dad, as we all plead it to our own souls.
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:21.640]   Pursue the holiness without which no one will see the Lord.
[00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:28.240]   Do that in the power of the Spirit on the basis of God's love through Christ.
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:29.240]   Excellent.
[00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:30.960]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:33.120]   And thank you for writing in, Jessica.
