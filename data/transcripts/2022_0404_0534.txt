[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.880]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:08.040]   skills, insights, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.760]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.020]   My name is Josh Reichits and today we wrap up our three-part series on financial lessons
[00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:16.700]   from recent crises.
[00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.520]   Part one was financial lessons from Ukraine.
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.480]   Part two was financial lessons from Russia.
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:28.020]   Today part three, financial lessons from the current crisis in the United States.
[00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.520]   That word crisis is a bit too strong for me.
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.000]   I wouldn't generally use it because I don't think we're living in a crisis, but there
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.280]   are certainly many yellow and red warning lights on all sides.
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.360]   You have a few examples here for you to consider.
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.680]   Number one, of course, you have significantly elevated levels of inflation based upon what
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.520]   we've been accustomed to over previous years.
[00:00:52.520 --> 00:01:01.220]   Right now the most recent median CPI figures that are available show that the median inflation
[00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.100]   rate is approaching 5%.
[00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:10.140]   That's a significantly higher inflation rate than we are accustomed to dealing with in
[00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.880]   the United States.
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.940]   You see the practical effect of that on all sides and you see concerns about the future,
[00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.360]   of where that could go in the future.
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.800]   In addition, related to the inflation, you see very practical impact in people's pocketbooks
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.200]   with very high fuel prices, which are causing a restructuring of people's budgets.
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:38.020]   Even areas that are traditionally associated with prosperity, such as high housing prices,
[00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.620]   I don't get the sense that most people feel all that great about the high housing prices.
[00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.400]   Oftentimes when there's a run up in housing prices, it leads to people feeling good because
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.160]   their wealth has increased.
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.920]   Just like when they have fat 401k accounts and fat housing prices, they feel wealthy
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.200]   and they can borrow money out and spend it, etc.
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:02.420]   But I get the impression that many Americans rather feel the pinch of high housing prices.
[00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.760]   They feel the pinch that if I sell my house, I have to buy another one and I'm going to
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.940]   get priced out of the market.
[00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.240]   How am I going to get an affordable house?
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.200]   There are a lot of people who would like to get into real estate who find it very difficult
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.640]   to summon the necessary funds to get into real estate.
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:24.160]   This traditional measure of prosperity feels different when it's put together with all
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:30.040]   of the other areas of high prices that people are experiencing right now.
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.200]   I think there are many other things that people are concerned about.
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.440]   There's concerns about security.
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.240]   Even though the United States is not involved directly, kinetically, in the war with Russia
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.700]   and Ukraine, the United States of course has been involved for many years in the war with
[00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.560]   Ukraine and Russia.
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.980]   People are concerned about escalation.
[00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.140]   People are concerned about getting involved with that.
[00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.640]   People are concerned about the impact of financial sanctions.
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.840]   There are significant concerns about even the basics of life such as food supply.
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.960]   I myself am very concerned about the possibility of widespread food shortages and even famine
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:15.440]   over the coming year or two because every single agricultural input, the price is very,
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.840]   very high right now.
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:23.480]   It seems difficult to see how given the disruptions in certain agricultural centers such as Russia
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:29.600]   and Ukraine, given the disruptions in the supply chain, the ability to redistribute
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:35.920]   food supplies around the globe, and given the massive high cost of agricultural inputs
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:43.080]   right now, everything from the basics of fertilizer to diesel fuel, etc., it seems difficult to
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:48.880]   see how the global food production is going to be high enough in the next couple of years
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.240]   to meet the world demand.
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.740]   When you think about the hundreds of millions of people who live on the edge, very well
[00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:01.040]   could lead to widespread famine in the next year or two, which is a very, very concerning
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.040]   trend.
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:08.920]   This is all on top of the widespread disruption, societal disruption that we've experienced
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.680]   in the United States and around the world.
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:17.560]   The arguments around the global pandemic, which has cost the lives of millions of people
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:24.240]   around the world, the massive disruption from that in terms of lifestyle, the arguments
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:31.480]   among neighbors as to how that should be managed and should have been managed, the destruction
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:37.560]   to many businesses, many jobs because of the economic fallout from responses to the pandemic,
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:46.000]   changes in supply and demand, you have this exacerbated by other hardcore conflicts.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:53.240]   This is not just limited to the United States, which is a very argumentative and violent
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.880]   culture, a culture prone to loud and public argumentation.
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.600]   This is happening in cultures that we traditionally understand to be more unified.
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.120]   You look at the disruption in the Canadian culture and the government response to the
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:12.240]   protests and the protesters and the counter protesters, and you see a traditionally unified
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:19.160]   culture such as the Canadian culture significantly disrupted compared to what we normally consider
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.160]   it to be.
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:25.520]   Even in authoritarian culture right now, there are widespread protests across China, people
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:32.840]   protesting the Chinese zero COVID policy, which has led to very widespread draconian
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.400]   lockdowns to limit the spread of coronavirus.
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:43.560]   And the people there are protesting, which is quite unusual for the authoritarian experience
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.340]   in China.
[00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.400]   And so when you look at these, the question is, well, what are the lessons that I can
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:53.400]   be learning from this stock market down this past quarter, worst quarter performance in
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.860]   the last few years?
[00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:59.600]   What are the lessons that I need to be learning from this experience?
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:05.080]   The first lesson I would like to draw your attention to is the experience, the situation
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:14.080]   in the United States is fundamentally different than the situation in Ukraine or in Russia.
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:20.560]   It's so fundamentally different that I feel a twinge of remorse and guilt even drawing
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:26.520]   a comparison, even pulling the three together in a series like this.
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:32.480]   And I'm doing so because my point is they're very different, but they're so different that
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:35.160]   you feel bad even looking at any problems.
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:40.760]   Because if you compare the problems being faced by Ukrainians defending their homeland
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:47.240]   or the problems being faced by Russians having their country isolated from the rest of the
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:53.760]   world, the problems in the United States seem like light and ordinary experiences, not even
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:56.920]   worthy of being talked about.
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:00.080]   But yet this is what I would say, this is the point.
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.640]   One of the things that I wrote in my notes in preparing for this is that it's good to
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:05.640]   be the king.
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:10.280]   And I think here in this situation, you see how it's good to be the king of the world.
[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:14.000]   It's good to be in the United States right now, because for all the problems that the
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.720]   United States has, which are significant and worth paying attention to, worth discussing,
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:23.680]   worth planning for, those problems pale in severity as compared to many places in the
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:24.800]   world.
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.640]   It's good to be the king.
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:31.800]   And this is a point that I've made for a long time, that one of the best ways to improve
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:36.680]   your situation in life is to be where the problems are not.
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:44.000]   When I talked about Ukraine, I drew the point, I said the best way to survive an actual war
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.360]   with bombs and guns, etc., is not being in the war, not being there.
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:56.360]   And while that's really hard to say, because I think we all look at, understand, and applaud
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:05.160]   those who take up arms to defend their homeland from a foreign invader, the most justified
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:12.120]   form of violence that exists, the impact of that violence, even in its most justified
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.440]   form, will change a generation.
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:20.560]   I made the point that it's very difficult to survive in a war zone, physically, with
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:21.560]   your life.
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:26.620]   But even if you do survive, it's very difficult, because you lose your life.
[00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:28.980]   You lose everything that is normal to you.
[00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:32.280]   You lose everything that is dear to you.
[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:35.260]   You lose your family, if you send your family away to safety.
[00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.560]   You lose your family if your family stays, because you're isolated from them.
[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:42.840]   You're trying to keep them in a safe little country town somewhere while you go and fight
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:44.320]   the invaders.
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:48.360]   You lose your business, not necessarily because your business is bombed, although that can
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:53.640]   happen, not necessarily because the demand disappears, although that does happen, not
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:57.680]   just because the market is completely disrupted, although of course that is true.
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:04.440]   You lose your business because you have no higher priority than saving your life and
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:08.680]   your homeland from the foreign invaders.
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:09.680]   It's like stress.
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:13.760]   If you're drowning in a swimming pool, you're not thinking about the stress of the stock
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:14.760]   market decline.
[00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:16.880]   You're thinking about, "How do I get air?"
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:22.100]   That's what happens in war, because the stress and the threat is so acute, you can't think
[00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:24.360]   about anything else.
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:28.580]   Even if the war ended today, there was an immediate ceasefire, the Russian troops withdrew,
[00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:34.160]   the Ukrainian troops withdrew, you lose years and years of your life.
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:38.200]   Because you have to rebuild, you have to clean up the rubble in the streets, you have to
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:47.040]   rebuild infrastructure, you lose years to the nightmares, the broken society, the lack
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.680]   of trust, the broken markets.
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:54.520]   So I made the point that if you can get out, the best thing to do is to get out.
[00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:59.000]   If you have to stay, at least try to feel like you need to stay and that's the right
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   thing for you to do, to stay and be together with your neighbors and defend your homeland,
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.520]   then getting your family out is your highest priority so that you can spare them to the
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:12.340]   greatest degree possible the trauma of war.
[00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:17.720]   Then in Russia, I made the point that in Russia, you lose your life and your lifestyle.
[00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:23.740]   No, you're not worried about the same level of physical danger of death, but you lose
[00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:28.320]   the ability to build your business, you lose the ability to improve your job and career,
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:33.320]   you lose the ability to think long term, which means that when you're living in a place where
[00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:41.040]   you're facing sanctions and the severe opprobrium and sanctions that the Russian people are
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:45.640]   facing, you're going to lose years and years and years of your life being there.
[00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:49.920]   And if possible, the best way to get those years back is to go someplace where you don't
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:55.860]   face those same levels of sanctions and build something where you can get back on a track
[00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:57.940]   of stability to build.
[00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:01.520]   When you compare the United States to that, what you see is the United States has none
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:03.100]   of those features.
[00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:07.240]   You don't have to be worried about the loss of your life on a daily basis from a bomb
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:08.540]   falling on you.
[00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:10.440]   You can build.
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:11.440]   Things are stable.
[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:12.440]   You can start something new.
[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:13.520]   You can build something new.
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:15.240]   You're not worried about that.
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:19.600]   And so when you look at that and you look at even the potential threats to the United
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:24.040]   States of things that could make things worse, one of the best places to be right now in
[00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.320]   the world is the United States.
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:31.760]   In fact, my travels of the world over the last years have raised my opinion of life
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:34.520]   in the United States quite substantially.
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:40.120]   When I first left the United States about three years or over three years ago now, I
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:45.920]   was pretty dark and negative in my outlook for the country.
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:50.080]   I was watching things internally that made me say, you know what?
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:52.560]   I don't know if life is the best here.
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:56.920]   But after three years of being abroad, living abroad, traveling back and forth the United
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:01.360]   States, traveling the world in over a dozen countries, I've come to the perspective of
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:07.820]   no, actually, in many cases, it's hard for me to say that there's a better place for
[00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:10.840]   most people than the United States.
[00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:15.240]   And in terms of practical evidence of that, what is the practical evidence of it?
[00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:18.920]   Well, number one, things are much more stable in the United States.
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:23.240]   It seems from an outside, especially when you look at the cultural strife and the arguments
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:28.080]   and whatnot, it seems from the outside that things are difficult.
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:31.600]   It often feels like, well, the culture is splitting apart, the country is splitting
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:32.600]   apart.
[00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.480]   I think that's true to a significant degree.
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:40.620]   But yet at its core, there's a giant bureaucracy, there's a giant system that just kind of trundles
[00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:44.920]   forward the way the things, the way that more or less the way things always have been, doesn't
[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:45.920]   change much.
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:48.380]   And so that leads to a sense of stability.
[00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:53.180]   From a financial perspective, you have the US dollar, which for all of its lacks, for
[00:12:53.180 --> 00:13:00.000]   all of its difficulties, for all of its injustices, is the world reserve currency and is the world's
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.980]   most stable in-demand currency.
[00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:06.860]   It is, it's inconceivable that the US dollar, for all the problems that it will face, will
[00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:10.920]   face the same problems as so many other currencies around the world.
[00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:13.260]   And so your money is safer.
[00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:17.180]   You look at the American stock market, you try to draw a comparison between the collapse
[00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:23.120]   of the Russian stock market and the declines in the American stock market recently.
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:27.300]   And it's just not even a valid point of comparison.
[00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:34.140]   The US stock market cannot collapse the way that the Russian stock market collapsed.
[00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:39.300]   Because if the US stock market did collapse that way, it would not signal, it's not the
[00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:44.780]   signal of a temporary thing, it's a signal of a complete implosion of the world, literally,
[00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:50.140]   because of the companies that are listed there, because of the centrality in the global market
[00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:51.140]   space.
[00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:55.180]   And so while it's certainly theoretically possible that you could have that kind of
[00:13:55.180 --> 00:14:03.200]   widespread collapse, it's just not practically conceivable in any reasonable, practical sense
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:05.240]   of analysis.
[00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:11.140]   When you look at the situation that the Russians and the Ukrainians face, the Russians being
[00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:15.000]   concerned about invasion, so then invading Ukraine, the Ukraines being concerned about
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.920]   invasion and getting invaded, you look at the European context, you realize how low
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:23.420]   the threat of war is for Americans.
[00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:28.420]   The US is so geographically insulated from virtually all violence from its neighbors,
[00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:36.020]   friendly neighbors to the north and to the south, two large, stable countries that don't
[00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:39.900]   have any meaningful military power compared to the United States.
[00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:44.660]   The United States is the king of the seas on a global basis, isolated and insulated
[00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:46.300]   on all sides.
[00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:53.160]   The idea of somebody invading the United States with a land invasion is laughable.
[00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:58.460]   It's utterly risible that somebody would think of invading the United States.
[00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:02.840]   The most hardcore of a scenario you could come up with would be somebody simply launching
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:06.060]   missiles at the United States.
[00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:12.220]   And even that is very hard to believe that would actually happen, although not outside
[00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:13.220]   of the realm of possibility.
[00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:18.180]   But the idea of somebody invading is utterly risible.
[00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:21.220]   The US is financially insulated from virtually all outside forces.
[00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:29.700]   You look at how deeply impacted Russia is and is going to be by the global sanctions,
[00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:31.180]   then you go back and you look at the United States.
[00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:35.860]   Here's a country that produces massive amounts of food, that manufactures massive amounts
[00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:36.860]   of stuff.
[00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:44.020]   Here's a country that has the world's dominant currency, the world that controls political
[00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:47.580]   maneuverings in virtually the entire world.
[00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:56.780]   The scale of power, economic power, financial power, military power, is so lopsided in favor
[00:15:56.780 --> 00:16:05.580]   of the United States that it's just impossible to believe that at this stage in world history,
[00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:10.420]   the United States would face any of the same kind of trials that other very powerful countries
[00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:12.540]   face.
[00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:18.860]   And the USA simply has the clout and the authority and the bullying power to get almost everything
[00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:19.860]   it needs.
[00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:20.860]   It has the clout to get what it needs.
[00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:29.940]   It has the internal resources to get what it needs in terms of very tremendous reservoirs
[00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:34.020]   of intelligence, hard work, companies, skills, etc.
[00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:40.340]   All united around a basic core identity, an identity of being an American people who is
[00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:43.860]   resilient, who is able to change.
[00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:49.900]   I think you saw this in the early stage of the pandemic when all of a sudden all across
[00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:54.660]   the country, all of these companies immediately turned themselves to producing face masks
[00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:59.860]   and to printing things for respirators and little valves and whatnot.
[00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:04.820]   But the level of creativity and the level of resources in the United States is so deep
[00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:11.420]   that the culture, when united around a central purpose, can respond very, very quickly and
[00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:14.580]   change things very, very quickly.
[00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:18.060]   And then the United States is vastly underpopulated.
[00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:23.340]   And so because it is so vastly underpopulated, it has room to maneuver.
[00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:30.260]   It has room for the population to adjust, change, to go and relocate within the country
[00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:33.660]   and follow the available trends.
[00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:40.700]   And so for all of the downsides of the United States, I look at the country after being
[00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:46.180]   gone for three years and a good sober analysis and I say it's very hard to believe that there's
[00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:50.620]   a better place to be on a broad scale for most people.
[00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:54.660]   It's very hard to think that there's some place better.
[00:17:54.660 --> 00:18:00.140]   And so the risk level being in the United States is much, much lower than it is in many
[00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:01.140]   other places.
[00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:08.620]   And I think that you see this with regard to even how the pandemic has played out.
[00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:12.020]   Now here you have to look a little bit at the...
[00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:13.780]   It's important you look at the death rate.
[00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:19.060]   Death rates in the United States high, much higher than many other nations of its peers.
[00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:21.140]   And you say, "Why is that?"
[00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:22.500]   And I think there are good reasons to that.
[00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:27.620]   But one of the things that I thought was so obvious is where did the, for example, vaccines,
[00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:31.060]   where did the vaccines get developed the most quickly?
[00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:33.900]   Well, the ones that worked got developed in the United States.
[00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:36.180]   You had vaccines developed quickly in Russia.
[00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:39.420]   You had vaccines developed quickly in China.
[00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:44.780]   You had various approaches throughout the Americas of different companies researching
[00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:45.780]   them.
[00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:50.020]   And in many of those, the efficacy proved to simply not be sufficient.
[00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:55.420]   The high-risk performing vaccines were developed by American companies, and then they were
[00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:57.860]   available very quickly in the United States.
[00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:02.780]   So back to the clout of the United States, both in terms of internal ability to develop
[00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:08.300]   things and also the financial power to go and buy vaccines from international manufacturers
[00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:11.140]   and get them brought into the United States quickly.
[00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:15.720]   The widest availability of vaccines, the quickest, was in the United States as compared to many
[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:16.940]   other places.
[00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:20.260]   And it was so widespread that basically at that time, any tourist could fly to the United
[00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:21.500]   States, get vaccinated, and go.
[00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:25.140]   They were begging people to get vaccinated all across the country, giving out prizes
[00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:27.700]   and whatnot in the United States.
[00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:30.540]   And so it shows as just kind of a microcosm.
[00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:34.300]   I looked at that and studied it all the way through, and I thought, "This is a good example
[00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:39.420]   of the power of these United States."
[00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:44.980]   And so when you look at that, and to be clear, that's not an all-consuming thing.
[00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:45.980]   I don't live in the U.S.
[00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:49.460]   I'm not going back to the United States to live.
[00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:53.740]   But when you study it, honestly, if you're in the United States, as most of my audience
[00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:58.300]   is, don't think that it's just magically better somewhere else.
[00:19:58.300 --> 00:19:59.580]   It's not.
[00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:05.660]   I have come from the last few years of travel, I have come to the conviction that most people
[00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:12.660]   should stay where they're from, and that includes Americans, and that there are very good reasons
[00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:17.860]   as to why you'll probably have the best long-term possibility of success in the United States
[00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:20.340]   as compared to other places.
[00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:25.860]   But when you look at these yellow warning signs that are around, it does give you reason
[00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:27.580]   to pay attention.
[00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:29.940]   So what do you need to pay attention to?
[00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:31.420]   What are the financial lessons?
[00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:38.180]   Well, I think the financial lessons are really the same ordinary run-of-the-mill lessons
[00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:41.460]   that I have been talking about for many years.
[00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:46.100]   And it's not to pat myself on the back, it's to say that I don't see anything new at the
[00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:49.020]   moment.
[00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:52.540]   Number one, you must protect your income.
[00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:54.740]   That is the number one goal that you have.
[00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:58.660]   Right now, in any place in the world, if you have an income, you're okay.
[00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:01.660]   And in the United States, if you have an income, you're okay.
[00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:04.460]   Why are the Russian sanctions so devastating?
[00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:06.300]   Well, for many reasons.
[00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:10.700]   One of the reasons they're devastating is it's destroying the incomes of many people.
[00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:15.100]   It's destroying the incomes of people living in Russia who work outside of Russia, meaning
[00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:17.500]   work online, publish things online.
[00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:21.380]   Their isolation in the banking system has made it impossible for many of them to get
[00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:24.620]   hold of the money that's owed to them for their work abroad.
[00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:31.180]   Because of the social probrium that the world is leveraging against Russia, then many people
[00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:34.540]   are simply dropping all of their Russian clients, even though those ordinary...
[00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:38.260]   Sorry, dropping Russian clients, yes, but dropping Russian workers, even though those
[00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:41.940]   Russian workers themselves have not done anything wrong.
[00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:47.800]   And then inside Russia, you have a massive economic crisis because the people are facing
[00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:48.800]   loss of work.
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:54.420]   You have companies, international companies, shuttering their shops, laying off their workforce.
[00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:57.580]   And that ripple effect spreads throughout the economy.
[00:21:57.580 --> 00:22:02.140]   If you have thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of people without work, then
[00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:06.620]   those people don't have the income now to go and buy, and that puts more thousands and
[00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:08.500]   thousands of people out of work.
[00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:11.980]   And so it's loss of income that's the primary problem.
[00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:17.140]   It's not the loss of power of the ruble, which has declined in value and then come back.
[00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:19.340]   If you're living in Russia, the ruble is still working fine.
[00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:21.540]   There's been no widespread inflation.
[00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:23.500]   The prices haven't shot off.
[00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:25.340]   There's no widespread shortages right now.
[00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:28.380]   But if you've lost your income, you've lost your ability to buy.
[00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:30.940]   You've lost your ability to live.
[00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:33.180]   But that's just because you lost your income.
[00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:38.980]   And so again, if you could protect your income in a crisis, you can get through that crisis
[00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:40.840]   very well.
[00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:44.640]   So looking at the United States, if you can keep your income, you can absorb the increases
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:45.840]   in the cost of your food.
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:49.300]   You can absorb the increases in the cost of your fuel.
[00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:52.000]   You can absorb it if you can keep your income.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:58.500]   So your goal is to keep your income, just to maintain it, if that's all you can do.
[00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:00.020]   If you can grow it, of course.
[00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:03.140]   But if all you can do is maintain it, you maintain it.
[00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:08.780]   Because the maintenance of that income will allow you to weather the economic crisis extremely
[00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:12.300]   well no matter how bad it gets.
[00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:13.920]   That's the core lesson.
[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:16.060]   So focus on keeping your income.
[00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:20.640]   Make a plan of, if I lost my income, how would I get more income quickly?
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:24.300]   Make a plan to make sure that you're not in the first round of layoffs if your company
[00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:26.420]   lays off.
[00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:27.420]   That's lesson number one.
[00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:30.260]   And there's no change from that today versus 10 years ago.
[00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:32.500]   The principle still remains true.
[00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:40.740]   Those who can keep their income through a crisis are generally going to be fine.
[00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:46.020]   Next, you cannot be living near the edge with your finances.
[00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:47.980]   That's the lesson that we see right now.
[00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:53.740]   You cannot have everything built so you're right on the edge.
[00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:58.820]   A guy who's got a good, healthy six-figure income, who's fixed an ordinary expenses or
[00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:06.100]   say 50% of his income, that guy doesn't care about increased cost of food, increased cost
[00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:10.060]   of fuel because you've got an ability to expand and to adjust.
[00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:12.540]   Okay, maybe you have to save less money.
[00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:16.220]   Maybe you have to work a little bit of overtime or something, but you can adjust your budget
[00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:19.260]   to match changing prices.
[00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:23.840]   But the guy who's got a low income or the guy who's got his fixed expenses as a very
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:29.020]   high percentage of his income, that guy's got major problems.
[00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:37.220]   There's a statement that is a really tone-deaf thing to say, but I think it's really true.
[00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:41.260]   And so even at the risk of it being offensive, I think it's worth saying.
[00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:44.460]   I've thought of it several times in watching the situation.
[00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:45.620]   The statement is this.
[00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:53.880]   "If the price of gas makes a major difference to your daily life, you're doing it wrong."
[00:24:53.880 --> 00:25:00.480]   "If the price of gas makes a major difference to your daily life, you're doing it wrong."
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:05.600]   Let me expand that statement because it's a provocative and inflammatory statement,
[00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:12.120]   but it holds a lesson that I think is the right lesson to hold.
[00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:18.600]   There's a small subset of businesses that are high consumers of fuel whose business
[00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:25.120]   will be majorly disrupted by the price of gas.
[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:29.840]   I'm not arguing that those people are doing it wrong because they can simply adjust their
[00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:30.880]   business.
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:38.120]   If you run a trucking company and you're consuming thousands and thousands of gallons of fuel,
[00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:40.480]   then you will simply adjust your prices.
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:41.880]   You'll adjust your freight charges.
[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:47.120]   You'll adjust your end product prices, whatever, very quickly to adapt to the increased cost
[00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:48.120]   of inputs.
[00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:49.640]   And that's as you should.
[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:51.800]   That's what you should do.
[00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:56.960]   But for an individual, an ordinary consumer, the price of gas should be a very, very small
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:01.440]   component of your situation.
[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:08.320]   And because if you have a high amount of income and a low amount of other expenses, you can
[00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:11.640]   easily adjust your spending on fuel.
[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:14.280]   You can easily absorb the increased costs.
[00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:19.860]   If you have a low income, then your number one focus should be to figure out how can
[00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:25.600]   I find an alternative that doesn't expose me to the high price of fuel.
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:30.880]   And so the way to get ahead financially is to do your very best to keep your expenses
[00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:34.960]   low as compared to the amount of your income.
[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:39.080]   Where I think you see the people who are hurting the most right now with fuel prices is those
[00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:45.920]   who have not structured their finances in a way that thinks about frugality and spending
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:47.080]   rates.
[00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:52.880]   I think here of a guy that I-- this is who I would have been when I was younger.
[00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:56.320]   But I had a family member who has a young boyfriend.
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:59.800]   And this guy, young guy, 18 years old.
[00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:06.960]   And he was from kind of the rural redneck culture in the United States.
[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:16.280]   And so his daily driver vehicle was a big Dodge pickup truck with a 5.7 liter Hemi,
[00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:22.400]   which is a fuel sucking vehicle that he was using exclusively to transport himself around.
[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:25.560]   And that's what I would have wanted, except I didn't want a Hemi.
[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:26.800]   I wanted a big old diesel.
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:27.960]   That's what I wanted in high school.
[00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:30.320]   I never got enough money together to get it.
[00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:31.960]   But he was able to do it.
[00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:35.320]   The problem is he's rolling around getting 10 miles per gallon.
[00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:37.640]   And so I think of him.
[00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:38.640]   Find out.
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:40.520]   I'm sure by this time he's sold his pickup.
[00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:45.560]   Because when fuel prices go up, it just becomes crazy for an 18-year-old to be trundling around
[00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:51.320]   doing tons of miles in a fuel sucking pickup truck that he has no useful need for.
[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:57.000]   And so that same 18-year-old can intelligently turn into a small economic car, can go to
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:01.800]   a motorcycle, a moped, something that gets 50, 80, 100 miles per gallon, and get the
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:04.160]   same basic functionality.
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:05.440]   That's what you need to do.
[00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:10.440]   If you have enough money that you want to drive a fuel sucking car, go for it.
[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:15.640]   But if you're still trying to get money together, you can't indulge your whims of having a beautiful
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:18.080]   cool pickup truck that sucks fuel down.
[00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:21.480]   You got to get a moped, something that's going to get you around and solve your transportation
[00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:24.360]   needs until you get your income coming in.
[00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:27.960]   So when you look at people who complain the most about gas and you look at the structure
[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:32.000]   of their life, their lives are not ordinarily structured towards wealth.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.800]   They're not making decisions to keep their expenses low as compared to their income so
[00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:37.720]   that they can invest money.
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:43.000]   What's happening is they're often living high consumption lifestyles as compared to their
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   income.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:50.520]   I don't want to drive a moped on a daily basis, but I have to find a solution to my transportation
[00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:54.560]   needs that still allows me to save money and absorb changes.
[00:28:54.560 --> 00:29:01.360]   I think in the current fuel price increase, you see the importance of that.
[00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:05.040]   If the price of gas makes a big difference in your daily life, you're doing it wrong.
[00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:11.520]   It's a sign that your ratio of expenses to your income is out of whack and you need to
[00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:13.560]   change.
[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:17.800]   That's the same in 2022 as it was in 2012.
[00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:24.320]   If you want to build wealth, you have to have your expenses much, much lower than your income.
[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:29.000]   Then when there are changes in the prices of things, you can absorb those changes.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:33.800]   Let me add one bit of mathematical analysis to why I say this at the risk of it being
[00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:34.800]   so...
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:40.520]   I'm trying to say it clearly, but at the risk of it being quite offensive.
[00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:50.840]   Let's say that your expenses are 50% of your income and there's a 10% change in your expenses.
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:56.120]   You suffer a 10% inflation of expenses.
[00:29:56.120 --> 00:30:03.840]   Now your expenses are 55% of your income rather than 50%.
[00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:05.520]   You can still save money.
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:06.520]   You're still okay.
[00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:10.200]   You can absorb a 10% inflation rate even if your income doesn't change to keep up with
[00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:11.200]   it.
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:18.960]   What if there's a 20% increase in your expenses, but you started with a structure of 50% expenses
[00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:21.440]   to income ratio?
[00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:30.000]   If your expenses increase by 20%, then they would go from 50% of your income to 60% of
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.200]   your income.
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:35.080]   That's a massive change, 20% increase.
[00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:37.800]   In your life, you can absorb that increase.
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:40.160]   You can absorb that uncertainty.
[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:42.880]   Now let's say that you're living right at the edge.
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:49.200]   Ordinarily, you have 90% of your income devoted to expenses.
[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:51.520]   You're saving 10%.
[00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:55.320]   And then there's a 10% change in your expenses.
[00:30:55.320 --> 00:31:02.080]   Well, a 10% change in your expenses would take your expense level from 90% to 99% of
[00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:03.080]   your income.
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:06.120]   What about a 20% change?
[00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:09.000]   Well now it's going to take you over 100% of your income and you're going to immediately
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.200]   be in the red.
[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:18.400]   So the key is to make sure that your expenses are modest as compared to your income.
[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:23.280]   That is what makes the difference in your ability to weather difficult circumstances
[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:25.960]   and hard times.
[00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:27.640]   Brings us to the next point.
[00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:31.780]   All the basics still apply in that you must have savings.
[00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:38.040]   If you have savings, liquid money, emergency fund, buffer funds, savings, money that you
[00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:44.200]   haven't consumed, then you can absorb the temporary increases in price while you restructure
[00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:46.060]   your life.
[00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:48.780]   You can absorb several months of being in the red.
[00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:54.320]   Even the guy who's got expenses at 90% and now due to over 10% inflation, he's over 100%
[00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:58.460]   of his expenses, he can absorb with savings.
[00:31:58.460 --> 00:31:59.760]   He can take up the slack.
[00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:05.760]   He can handle his expenses for a few months until he can restructure his life.
[00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:12.280]   He can go and buy a moped or figure out some solution to deal with the price of gas.
[00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:17.640]   He has time to figure out how to get his garden in and get it productive to get food so he
[00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:20.080]   can lower his food budget.
[00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:26.640]   Now those are silly but practical examples that if it's at that point, that's what you
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:27.640]   need.
[00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:29.640]   You need the savings in order to absorb it.
[00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:30.840]   And that's what savings do.
[00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:34.300]   They give you a buffer zone against unanticipated expenses.
[00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:36.340]   Why do we have emergency funds?
[00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:38.080]   Why do we have savings funds?
[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:44.040]   Well, they give us a buffer against disruptions that we can't anticipate perfectly.
[00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:49.680]   They allow us to be calm and relaxed while we figure out how to solve problems.
[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:53.880]   That's why when you have a buffer on a production line, you have a buffer of materials, if there's
[00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:57.680]   a disruption of materials, you can keep your supply line, you can keep your production
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:58.680]   line going.
[00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:02.960]   In every business, having a buffer allows you to say, "All right, how do I make new,
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:05.520]   fresh, good decisions in this situation?"
[00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:08.360]   That hasn't changed because of high inflation rates.
[00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:12.360]   What's happened is it's become more important in high inflation rates.
[00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:15.800]   Your savings haven't just lost their value because there's a 5% inflation rate.
[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:17.300]   It's the exact opposite.
[00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:21.660]   Your savings have become more valuable because there's a 5% inflation rate.
[00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:26.520]   They're much more valuable to you as you figure out what to do.
[00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:30.000]   By the way, I just hear so many of the audience saying, "5%, Joshua, 5%!
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   It's much more than that."
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.240]   It may be.
[00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:33.880]   In some cases, it is.
[00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:35.280]   But it doesn't change the fundamental point.
[00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:41.440]   If you're facing a 15% inflation rate in your personal level of expenses, your savings are
[00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:47.000]   now much more valuable to you as you figure out, "What should I do?
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.160]   Should I take this and go and buy a bunch of food?
[00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:51.240]   Should I go and buy a bunch of fuel?
[00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:55.600]   Should I go and buy a bunch of hard assets?
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:34:00.400]   Should I go and keep the money in case of future disruptions?"
[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:09.920]   The savings become more valuable in times of inflation than they do in other scenarios.
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:11.480]   Next lesson.
[00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:18.640]   I still continue to believe that most "normal" financial planning moves will work out.
[00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:23.560]   Meaning that if you look at the situation in the United States, there's no reason to
[00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:25.840]   panic and sell stocks.
[00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:28.880]   There's no reason to panic and say, "This is forever."
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:33.920]   There's no reason to panic at all.
[00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:39.960]   I still continue to believe that ordinary day-to-day financial advice is still sound.
[00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:48.240]   There's no big structural problem that needs to be changed immediately.
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:51.720]   And if you look at the availability of things, being in the United States is one of the best
[00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:53.040]   places to be in the world.
[00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:59.240]   Now, I don't think that all countries are going to weather the current difficulties
[00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:02.560]   as well as the United States will.
[00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:07.880]   And going forward, how could things get worse?
[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:10.160]   And will other countries weather?
[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:11.720]   So let's talk about how things get worse.
[00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:16.560]   My biggest concern right now is not nuclear war, although that is a concern.
[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:19.880]   My biggest concern right now is food supplies.
[00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:22.000]   And I think it should be a concern for you.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.920]   You need to watch this very, very carefully.
[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:28.120]   But if you don't have any food, if you don't have any kind of stockpiles of food, I beg
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:37.600]   you, go this weekend and turn some of your US coins, your token fiat money, into food.
[00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:42.320]   Food that your family will eat eventually, whether it's available or not.
[00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:43.920]   Whether it's widespread availability or not.
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:45.760]   Go and buy food.
[00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:51.800]   Because right now, there are red flashing warning lights all over the global food system.
[00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:55.880]   I'm hoping that things can change.
[00:35:55.880 --> 00:36:00.360]   I'm hoping that by changing the price of food, it becoming much more expensive, we can keep
[00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:02.120]   it available.
[00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:05.480]   That's going to have a big impact because you'd be spending a lot more money, but at
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:08.400]   least it would be available and there wouldn't be widespread famine.
[00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:13.280]   I'm hoping that there can be a quick response to the high prices and there can be more food
[00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:14.280]   planted.
[00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:22.200]   But right now, there are big, big problems on the horizon for that.
[00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:25.240]   In that situation though, what works?
[00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:27.320]   Ordinary preparedness works.
[00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:28.320]   Ordinary prepping.
[00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:31.880]   I have for years made these statements.
[00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:36.400]   Number one, ordinary financial planning works until it doesn't.
[00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:41.280]   Everything I've said works, has been ordinary financial planning.
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:44.320]   What could happen that would make ordinary financial planning not work?
[00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:49.840]   Well, it would be if there was literally not enough supplies of food.
[00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:54.720]   That could lead to, would lead to widespread social disruption.
[00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:58.280]   If you thought social disruption was bad during COVID, you ain't seen nothing yet.
[00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:04.200]   Wait till there's famine in the land and all of a sudden now, everything falls apart.
[00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:08.320]   But you can avoid that for you and your family by having food.
[00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:12.640]   So I've been stockpiling significantly over the last couple of weeks, trying to make sure
[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:18.400]   that our larders are full.
[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:19.400]   That could be a big thing.
[00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:25.280]   That could be a big, big trend over the next year or two that could be seriously disruptive.
[00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:29.440]   I'm hoping that we can avoid it.
[00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:31.760]   I'm planning for the fact that we can't.
[00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:34.280]   That wouldn't make financial planning fall apart.
[00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:38.880]   It would just mean that you need to have money to buy the food and the cheapest time to do
[00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:39.880]   it is now.
[00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:43.400]   And then later, you need to have the money to buy the food then, assuming that it is
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:45.920]   available.
[00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:50.280]   That's not a remaking and that's not a reason to leave the United States.
[00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:58.080]   In fact, I think that the United States will have the least impact of any country from,
[00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:02.680]   if it happens, of disruptions in the global food supplies.
[00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:07.160]   What I really worry about is so many other nations around the world that have far higher
[00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:10.600]   levels of poverty and that are far more dependent on exports.
[00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:15.680]   The United States is very highly food independent.
[00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:22.760]   And if food became short, the United States makes plenty of food to feed itself, the basic
[00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:26.920]   staple crops, and then that can be easily supplemented, especially with modern growing
[00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:30.920]   technology of all the stuff around the edges, vegetables, etc.
[00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:32.520]   That stuff can be brought into production quickly.
[00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:38.160]   The United States is so technologically advanced, I think it could be brought into production
[00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:41.360]   very quickly.
[00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:43.360]   I'm not too worried about that in the United States.
[00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:47.640]   What I'm worried about is on a global basis, where there's far higher levels of poverty
[00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:55.680]   and far lower levels of production and lower levels of ability to respond.
[00:38:55.680 --> 00:39:00.960]   If food became scarce in the United States, people left and right, the best business to
[00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:09.520]   be in would be selling UV lights, grow lights, greenhouses, hydroponic kits for salad greens,
[00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:10.520]   things like that.
[00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:19.040]   Maybe it would be a great thing to point our culture more and more towards a localized
[00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:24.000]   production where every kitchen has one of those cool little salad walls in it, and every
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:29.800]   backyard has a little vegetable plot in it, and there's a little hen coop of chickens
[00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:32.100]   outside every kitchen window.
[00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:33.100]   Maybe that would be a good thing.
[00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:35.480]   I'd love to see it, but maybe it would be a good thing.
[00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:39.320]   The point is that the United States, because there's so much money, people can respond.
[00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:40.600]   They can adjust to that.
[00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:45.400]   I worry about it on a global basis more than I do about the United States.
[00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:49.160]   The other thing, of course, is the threat of war.
[00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:53.960]   A few weeks ago, I talked about my biggest concern with cyber warfare.
[00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:55.560]   At this point, none of that has emerged.
[00:39:55.560 --> 00:40:00.720]   It's been an interesting question is why has, for example, Russia, that the world believes
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:05.640]   and has believed has a very sophisticated ability to engage in cyber warfare, why have
[00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:08.200]   they not seemingly used those abilities?
[00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:12.000]   They haven't done much in Ukraine, and they haven't done much around the world.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:16.280]   I can understand why they haven't done much around the world, but why they haven't done
[00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:19.560]   much in Ukraine is a harder question to answer.
[00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:26.320]   It seems to me that the risk level has come down.
[00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:31.120]   As long as the Russians will be able to finish their war in some way that allows them to
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:36.240]   save face, then I think it would lower the risk of the conflict spreading beyond the
[00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:37.920]   region.
[00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:40.280]   I think that the risk is much, much lower.
[00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:46.400]   However, it is interesting to think about what if you did get, instead of an erroneous
[00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:52.160]   alert, what if you got an actual alert that said, "Hey, there's a nuclear missile inbound
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:53.160]   to your city.
[00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:54.640]   Do you have a plan for that?"
[00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:58.480]   It's not something that most of us think about, but the lesson that I look at it is wouldn't
[00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:00.840]   you feel better if you had a plan for that?
[00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:06.720]   Wouldn't you feel better if you actually had a bunker, a blast room in your basement, or
[00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:11.040]   a bunker in your backyard, or a little piece of land that you could get to where you had
[00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:12.480]   a bunker and supplies, etc.?
[00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:15.380]   Wouldn't that make you feel better?
[00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:21.000]   As I've gone through it in the analysis, I think that when you look at these scenarios,
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:26.960]   you recognize that, "Hey, if I have the money, if I'm a millionaire, it might be worth it
[00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:29.440]   for me to go ahead and build out a bunker.
[00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:33.520]   It might be worth it for me to make sure that I was well protected from those things in
[00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:36.880]   case the financial markets collapsed and it didn't work anymore."
[00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:41.160]   You cannot pretend that the world is just going to be at peace for the rest of your
[00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:46.480]   life and so making a plan that that is the case doesn't make sense.
[00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:50.000]   You have to make a plan that works no matter what.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:56.320]   Final thing I point out is I think when you look at the situation in the United States,
[00:41:56.320 --> 00:42:00.600]   you see how, or on the world, excuse me, when you look at the situation in the world, you
[00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:07.080]   see how you don't get to choose and necessarily get one disaster after another.
[00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:10.420]   And that's oftentimes what can provoke a crisis.
[00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:18.240]   The Ukrainian people have gone through a very difficult flu pandemic with widespread loss
[00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:24.400]   of life, widespread economic disruption, political unrest, et cetera.
[00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:28.600]   And then that was exacerbated by their country being invaded.
[00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:34.000]   The Russian people have gone through a very difficult flu pandemic, widespread loss of
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:41.480]   life, widespread restrictions, et cetera, and then they go through global sanctions
[00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:43.840]   being levied against them.
[00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:51.960]   The American people have gone through a disruptive event, a disruptive flu, widespread economic
[00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:58.000]   difficulties, widespread disruptions, and now all of a sudden got to deal with high
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:02.900]   gas rates, high gas prices, increasing rates of inflation, et cetera.
[00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:06.020]   So you don't get to choose one crisis at a time.
[00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:07.600]   They often come together.
[00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:12.060]   And so when you do deep level planning, it's often because you recognize that while any
[00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:18.440]   one particular threat may not be such a big deal, I don't get to choose whether one threat
[00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:21.420]   comes at a time or not.
[00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:26.780]   There have been a lot of businesses wiped out over the last couple of years completely.
[00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:30.280]   Those people are still suffering and trying to figure out how to get things forward.
[00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:35.020]   And they're really upset about high gas rates.
[00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:39.220]   Maybe they were perfectly set up to where, hey, gas prices aren't a big deal in my life
[00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:42.660]   before, but now gas prices are a big deal.
[00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:45.880]   And they used up all their savings trying to keep their business afloat.
[00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:52.440]   And now you have uncertainty, you have economic uncertainty, inflation, risks of war, et cetera.
[00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:59.780]   So the reason you do planning, even for hardcore deep level scenarios, is that you can't predict
[00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:02.940]   the scenario that you specifically will face.
[00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:07.020]   You don't know specifically when it will happen to you.
[00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:13.020]   And so because of that, you acknowledge it and you do the deep level planning.
[00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:16.700]   That's the lesson from the United States.
[00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:21.180]   I think that things in the United States are really not that bad.
[00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:25.940]   And I don't think they're really going to be that bad, especially when held on a global
[00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:28.020]   basis.
[00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:32.700]   I think that if you can get to the United States and you're not thriving where you are,
[00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:38.140]   one of the best places to be in the coming year is going to be in the United States.
[00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:42.860]   But all of the basics still apply.
[00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:45.420]   And even hardcore planning still applies.
[00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:51.900]   And by planning for disasters and disruptions, it puts a sense of stability in your life
[00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:57.580]   that allows you to keep building for what you want to actually have happen.
[00:44:57.580 --> 00:45:04.180]   I see this as the fundamental reason why do I talk so much about disaster planning.
[00:45:04.180 --> 00:45:09.660]   As I see it, it's so that you can go on and ignore the disasters without worrying about
[00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:10.660]   things so much.
[00:45:10.660 --> 00:45:22.300]   There's interesting research people do about what causes children to be economically successful.
[00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:28.500]   And there are some who argue with data to indicate good strength to their arguments
[00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:33.300]   that the children of wealthy people always do better than the children of non-wealthy
[00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:34.300]   people.
[00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:36.060]   And people try to figure out why is that.
[00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:39.980]   Is it because they went to better schools, because they were given more money, et cetera?
[00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:45.860]   But one of the arguments that I think is pretty powerful is the children of wealthy people
[00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:49.620]   don't worry about getting wiped out.
[00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:52.220]   They don't worry about having enough food to eat.
[00:45:52.220 --> 00:45:55.700]   They don't worry about going bankrupt and being homeless.
[00:45:55.700 --> 00:45:58.500]   They don't worry about those things.
[00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:02.900]   And because they don't worry about those things, they can take bigger risks.
[00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:05.740]   They can go for things that other people wouldn't do.
[00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:11.020]   In my own life, I observed this that when I was in college, I was worried about having
[00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:13.000]   enough money to pay for school.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:18.780]   And because of that, I didn't go after some of the high-level internships that other people
[00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:22.240]   went after because I needed to make money today.
[00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:24.980]   Looking back, I now see that I made the wrong choice.
[00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:28.500]   I should have gone after those high-level internships instead of worrying about making
[00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:33.300]   money today because it would have been a significant advance in my life and in my career.
[00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:34.300]   I was wrong.
[00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:36.020]   I did the wrong thing.
[00:46:36.020 --> 00:46:37.940]   But I didn't know better.
[00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:39.380]   And so you see this played out, right?
[00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:43.420]   You see that the children of wealthy people will go and take the unpaid internship that
[00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:45.300]   has much better access.
[00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:49.100]   They'll go and start a business that may or may not go and that may or may not have any
[00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:51.380]   cash flow today and it still works.
[00:46:51.380 --> 00:46:56.860]   And yet the children of poor people often feel more pressure to make it today, to make
[00:46:56.860 --> 00:47:02.900]   money today, to be okay, to not get wiped out, to not be a burden on mom and dad, etc.
[00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:06.500]   I think there's really good evidence to say that that can be true.
[00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:08.340]   Now, there are countervailing arguments, right?
[00:47:08.340 --> 00:47:12.180]   You can appreciate the hunger that poor people have that rich people often don't express
[00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:13.840]   so seriously.
[00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:22.140]   But on the whole, I can't see how you're better off if you don't have a safety net psychologically.
[00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:24.780]   So that's why you build a safety net under yourself now.
[00:47:24.780 --> 00:47:29.180]   I can't go back and change what I did or didn't do at 18 years old.
[00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:34.060]   But you build a safety net under yourself now so that you can move on.
[00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:39.460]   And if you've got a year's supply of food in your pantry, you don't need to spend time
[00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:41.700]   worrying about food on a weekly basis.
[00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:45.200]   You don't spend time worrying about food and, "I gotta go to the store."
[00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:49.540]   Even just the simple convenience of, "I gotta go to the store."
[00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:50.540]   You have it covered.
[00:47:50.540 --> 00:47:51.540]   They got plenty.
[00:47:51.540 --> 00:47:52.540]   No big deal.
[00:47:52.540 --> 00:47:54.300]   We'll make a big shopping trip once a month.
[00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:56.800]   And then if prices go up, okay, we'll keep buying.
[00:47:56.800 --> 00:47:59.100]   But if we don't need to buy, it's no big deal.
[00:47:59.100 --> 00:48:05.660]   And so by being conservative in your financial planning, it allows you to be more aggressive
[00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:10.300]   in your business planning, in your career planning, in your income planning.
[00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:11.300]   That's how I see it.
[00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:16.740]   I've tried to figure out where's the right balance of conservatism and being aggressive.
[00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:19.100]   And as I see it, that's the balance.
[00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:23.060]   Be conservative in your consumption so that you can be aggressive in your income.
[00:48:23.060 --> 00:48:26.980]   And then you can go after the opportunities that you see knowing that you have a safety
[00:48:26.980 --> 00:48:31.060]   net, knowing that you're not likely to get wiped out, knowing that you can fall back
[00:48:31.060 --> 00:48:38.980]   on your reserves in the same way that the child of wealthy parents knows that, "Hey,
[00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:39.980]   I'm never gonna be homeless.
[00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:43.860]   So therefore, I can be more aggressive in the opportunities that I go after."
[00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:48.540]   Hope these lessons are useful to you.
[00:48:48.540 --> 00:48:55.420]   We're not in a period of prosperity for many people, but yet prosperity is often created
[00:48:55.420 --> 00:48:56.420]   out of times of crisis.
[00:48:56.420 --> 00:49:01.320]   And so my hope for you is that you and your family would be able to navigate whatever
[00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:11.160]   level of crisis you're facing personally, be it war, be it sanctions, or be it inflation.
[00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:13.000]   My hope is that you'd be able to navigate it.
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:17.440]   And my hope is that you would have great wisdom to be able to figure out, "How do I capitalize
[00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:19.720]   on this crisis?
[00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:21.240]   How do I find ways to improve?
[00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:24.320]   How do I find ways to adjust it?"
[00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:28.120]   I'm seeking to do that myself.
[00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:30.760]   And I have a brand new course called International Escape Plan.
[00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:35.440]   I haven't talked about that on this class much, but it's my way of capitalizing on a
[00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:36.440]   crisis.
[00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:39.120]   It's my way of saying, "Hey, here's things I've taught for a long time.
[00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:40.880]   Let me reteach it brand new."
[00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:45.160]   Because as part of that, it's a matter of saying that if you're prepared to leave your
[00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:49.040]   country, as I talked about and showed with Ukraine and Russia, if you're prepared to
[00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:52.720]   leave your country, you can be prepared to thrive in the middle of a crisis.
[00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:57.760]   So let me just close today's show with an ad that in addition to what I have said, if
[00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:02.880]   you do not have a plan to get out of your country, then I think that that is a real
[00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:05.400]   blind spot in your overall thinking.
[00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:09.560]   There are many things that can happen that could cause you to want to leave your country.
[00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:15.040]   Your country could be very robust in a great economic state, but they shut you in your
[00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:18.560]   apartment and don't let you leave for weeks at a time, months at a time.
[00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:19.920]   Just imagine living in China right now.
[00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:20.920]   They say you can't come out.
[00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:25.400]   They got robotic dogs trotting through the street with loudspeakers and cameras going
[00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:27.520]   to a central place, keeping you in your apartment.
[00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:32.080]   They literally bolt you into your apartment building in some buildings.
[00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:33.400]   Today they're doing that.
[00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:36.120]   I can't even imagine living in that kind of place.
[00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:38.120]   Imagine that happens in your country.
[00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:39.120]   Get out, man.
[00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:40.120]   Go somewhere free.
[00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:41.120]   Right?
[00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:44.120]   If you're living in Canada and you don't want to live in it, get out.
[00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:46.200]   Go somewhere free.
[00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:52.140]   What if they pass some medical mandate that you don't think is right?
[00:50:52.140 --> 00:50:53.400]   They say you've got to get this.
[00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:57.240]   You've got to take the jab or you've got to go and get this medical procedure done or
[00:50:57.240 --> 00:50:58.240]   you can't be here.
[00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:01.080]   You're not allowed to have rights like the rest of people.
[00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:02.920]   Get out.
[00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:05.160]   It's crazy to live under that kind of stuff.
[00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:06.520]   Get out and go somewhere else.
[00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:10.000]   Or it could be the fact that, hey, I'm living in a place and all of a sudden there's a threat
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:14.280]   of war from our neighbor or to the threat of economic problems due to our country going
[00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:15.740]   to war.
[00:51:15.740 --> 00:51:17.480]   Get out and go build somewhere.
[00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:24.480]   Don't lose the most precious thing that you have, which is time to these outside circumstances.
[00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:29.240]   So if you're interested in building a practical, reasonable plan for that and you're interested
