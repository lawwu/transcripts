[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.100]   while building a plan for financial freedom
[00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.800]   in 10 years or less.
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.900]   On today's show, we continue our series
[00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.780]   on how to invest in your children at an early age.
[00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.680]   This is clearly a very extensive series,
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.380]   and what I'm seeking to do is to persuade you
[00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.180]   that when you think of investing your money,
[00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.980]   you ought not first to think of a product
[00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.980]   that you can buy from a financial product salesman.
[00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.140]   Rather, you should think broadly about the term.
[00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.300]   And I'm developing in detail a thesis
[00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.620]   that I've had for many years that most of the dollars
[00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.660]   that parents save to spend and invest in their children,
[00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.500]   for example, to purchase mutual funds
[00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.460]   and put them in a 529 account,
[00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.060]   are probably better off spent in some other form
[00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.060]   or fashion at an early age into the wellbeing
[00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.460]   and intelligence of the child.
[00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.820]   And so while these are not mutually exclusive,
[00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.020]   you can do both if you have the money,
[00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.020]   I wanna encourage you that you're gonna get a better bang
[00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.100]   for your buck by focusing on these things
[00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.140]   that I'm talking about.
[00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.140]   So in this series, we began by talking about your child,
[00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.380]   preconception of your child and the basic genetic material
[00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.340]   that your child inheritance, conception and childbirth.
[00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.860]   Then we talked about nourishing your child's body,
[00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.740]   helping him to develop a body that is free of disease,
[00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.140]   that is vigorous in health,
[00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.940]   helping him to maximize his genetic potential
[00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.060]   in terms of height and beauty, et cetera,
[00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.940]   with good nutrition and a clean environment,
[00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.540]   lots of exercise, getting stronger, et cetera.
[00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.980]   Then we pivoted from the body to the mind.
[00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.900]   And with regard to the mind,
[00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.580]   I spent two episodes focusing on literacy.
[00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.380]   And now in this episode, we're going to turn to numeracy
[00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.460]   because these two things go hand in hand.
[00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.420]   Literacy and numeracy are the basics
[00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.620]   and they're certainly the basics of academics,
[00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.980]   but I think they're the basic skills of life.
[00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.620]   If we had to choose one or the other to focus on,
[00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.740]   I think literacy would take us farther.
[00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.860]   Someone who's very good at math,
[00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.300]   but for some reason can't read
[00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.420]   is gonna have a harder time absorbing the information
[00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.860]   that he needs in a practical sense in life.
[00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.380]   And so if we had to choose between the two,
[00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.580]   we wanna emphasize literacy,
[00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.100]   but I don't think we ever have to choose.
[00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.420]   I think a strong and healthy mind
[00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.300]   should be maintaining both of these things together,
[00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.180]   be both highly literate and highly numerate,
[00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.820]   and they work together.
[00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.460]   Now, towards the end of this episode,
[00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.420]   I'll talk about an appropriate progression
[00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.380]   because I am not persuaded that numeracy
[00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.020]   is something that should be emphasized
[00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.060]   in the youngest of ages.
[00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.500]   And while I have titled this series,
[00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.500]   How to Invest in Your Young Children,
[00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.380]   I think we should be careful at the age
[00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:05.060]   of which we really start to focus on numeracy.
[00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.220]   But at its core,
[00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.740]   we want our children to be highly numerate.
[00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.760]   Why is this important in this context?
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.340]   Well, at its core,
[00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.780]   numeracy is a way of making your children smarter.
[00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.180]   And we wanna have children that are beautiful,
[00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.980]   that are strong, that are physically dexterous,
[00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.140]   but we also wanna have children
[00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.460]   that are very, very smart and well-informed,
[00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.500]   and we wanna maximize their brain muscles.
[00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.940]   The brain is a muscle that should be viewed
[00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.900]   like other muscle groups.
[00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.820]   The more it's exercised,
[00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.940]   the stronger and more powerful it becomes.
[00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.700]   And we want our children to have
[00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.220]   large and healthy physical muscles,
[00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.940]   and we want them to have a large and healthy brain.
[00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:49.980]   Interestingly, of course,
[00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.240]   the physical muscles feed the brain.
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.360]   Exercise is good for your thinking ability
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.940]   because the brain is a muscle,
[00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.860]   but the brain needs to be exercised
[00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.260]   not with the lifting of physical weights,
[00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.420]   but with the manipulation of mental processes.
[00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.220]   And this is something that is applicable
[00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.820]   to you and to me as adults,
[00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.460]   but also to our children.
[00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.200]   So we want our children to exercise their brains
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.620]   on a daily basis.
[00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.500]   I've had this theory for a while
[00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.060]   about what a perfect brain day would look like for me.
[00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.340]   You know, how do I make my brain smarter on a daily basis?
[00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:23.420]   Well, I need to exercise it.
[00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:24.300]   So what does that look like?
[00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:29.100]   Well, ideally, on a daily basis in a perfect world,
[00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.260]   I'd like to make sure that I read something,
[00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.220]   that something that I read should be beautiful,
[00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:36.620]   it should be attractive,
[00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.940]   it should inform me, and it should inspire me.
[00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.260]   So I want to access something that's beautiful
[00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.340]   and informative and well-written.
[00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.400]   So that's gonna involve not just, you know,
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.280]   day-to-day dime store literature,
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.360]   but something that raises me up.
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.000]   I wanna exercise my brain with math.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.240]   So I wanna do some form of a math workout every day,
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.520]   if at all possible.
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:07.600]   And I wanna look at math as a way of strengthening my brain.
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.840]   And so in a perfect world,
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.640]   I should be regularly building my mathematical ability.
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.480]   In an ideal day, I should be making myself smarter
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:19.200]   with studying and learning and exercising
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.000]   some new language, learning new vocabulary,
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.840]   reading something, expanding my brain.
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.640]   Multilingualism also is proven to enhance my brain ability.
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.580]   If at all possible, I'd like to engage
[00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.800]   in some kind of musical activity.
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.800]   So if I can play an instrument or engage in something
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.400]   that's gonna build that skill,
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.600]   that helps me on a daily basis.
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.920]   Something that's aesthetic would be quite valuable.
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:49.740]   So if I can draw or paint or just appreciate art,
[00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:50.580]   something like that.
[00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.200]   And of course, we get into all the world of emotions,
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:55.240]   surrounding myself with the positive emotions of love
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.180]   and a vision and goal setting, et cetera.
[00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:58.960]   All these things are good.
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.060]   All of them contribute,
[00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:04.160]   and they do some heavy lifting in our brains.
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.580]   But at its core, the ones that work up our brains
[00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:11.880]   the hardest are math and foreign languages.
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.360]   That's where we often have to think, we have to struggle.
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:17.880]   And it's that exercise of thinking hard
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:20.520]   that makes the brain harder.
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:23.000]   There are benefits, of course, to going for a walk.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.200]   Many of them, many physical benefits.
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:28.120]   But if you want to grow your muscular ability,
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:30.280]   you have to lift heavy weights.
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.320]   And mentally, it's the same thing.
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:34.080]   There are benefits to just simply going
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:37.040]   and using and enjoying our brains, right?
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.440]   We all enjoy a relaxing novel
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.160]   or something that's very, very simple.
[00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.320]   But in order to grow our brain muscles,
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:44.880]   we have to challenge it.
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:48.000]   And one of the fundamentally most useful ways
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.960]   to challenge your brain is quite simply with math.
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:56.960]   It's extremely valuable to build your brain muscles.
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:59.600]   Math builds your brain muscles
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:03.880]   and strengthens them at a measurable level.
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.740]   Think of it as a mental workout,
[00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:09.040]   and it makes your brain work more efficiently,
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.880]   more productively, and more effectively.
[00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:13.760]   And this is a really important reason
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:18.760]   to actually study math, regardless of any practical concepts,
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.640]   meaning regardless of any practicality.
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:23.000]   I read you a couple of paragraphs
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.680]   from a book called "The Equation for Excellence,
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:29.000]   "How to Make Your Child Excel at Math" by Arvind Vohra.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.880]   And in the very first chapter,
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.680]   he talks about why study math.
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:38.300]   And I think it's important that you understand this concept.
[00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:40.300]   When children ask why they need to study math,
[00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:41.860]   the answer usually has something to do
[00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:43.020]   with either daily life
[00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:45.960]   or applications to science and technology.
[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.540]   The problem with the first motivation
[00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:51.960]   is that it is an obvious and transparent lie.
[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.160]   The second type of motivation
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.340]   tends to have the opposite of the intended effect.
[00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:59.780]   The daily life explanation tells students
[00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:02.340]   that they will need math for their daily activities.
[00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:04.120]   For example, they will need to calculate the tip
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:06.140]   in a restaurant or determine how much they should pay
[00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:07.540]   for their groceries.
[00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:08.820]   Most students are quick to point out
[00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:09.960]   that this problem can be solved
[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.620]   by carrying around a calculator.
[00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:13.640]   And anyone who is worried about running out of batteries
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.700]   can carry around a spare set of batteries
[00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:17.240]   or even two calculators.
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:19.660]   Even cell phones have built-in calculators.
[00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:21.500]   And quick aside, isn't it so funny
[00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:24.700]   how antiquated your language can sound
[00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:26.380]   when there's a technological change?
[00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:28.620]   This book was published in 2007.
[00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:32.500]   And it's ironic because of how antiquated
[00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:36.100]   the language sounds when that was a mere 16 years ago.
[00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:38.540]   But of course, 2007 was the year that the iPhone,
[00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:40.660]   I think it was 7, oh, 7, yeah, pretty sure,
[00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:42.340]   is the year the iPhone came out.
[00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:44.060]   So a mere 16 years later,
[00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:46.660]   this book just sounds laughably antiquated
[00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:47.580]   with that comment.
[00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:52.040]   The arguments against the daily life explanation continue.
[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.820]   In daily life, you never need to do more
[00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:56.620]   than add, subtract, multiply, or divide.
[00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:58.380]   Why learn trigonometry?
[00:09:58.380 --> 00:09:59.840]   Why study calculus?
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:02.260]   Why do anything beyond arithmetic?
[00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.940]   Even math-oriented jobs rarely require
[00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:06.700]   any really advanced math.
[00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:08.120]   When I worked as an actuary,
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:10.580]   the only math I used on the job was multiplication
[00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:12.440]   and the occasional exponent.
[00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:14.140]   The actuarial profession is one of the most
[00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:16.380]   math-oriented professions in the world.
[00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:18.100]   The other rationale for studying math
[00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:20.420]   focuses on science and technology.
[00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:23.220]   We need math to design space shuttles and satellites,
[00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:26.420]   to work in laboratories, and to build the newest computers.
[00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:28.580]   In one way, this argument makes sense.
[00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:32.300]   Much of that work requires intensive use of advanced math.
[00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:34.400]   But very few people work in those areas.
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.420]   Those that work in those areas usually do so
[00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:38.200]   because of an internal passion,
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:41.200]   not because of any external motivation.
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.140]   In fact, from the perspective of most students,
[00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:46.680]   there is very little external motivation to be a scientist.
[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:49.740]   The strongest external motivators for most teenagers
[00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:52.180]   are money, fame, power, popularity,
[00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:54.380]   and attraction to the opposite sex.
[00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:56.380]   None of these powerfully motivate students
[00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:58.420]   to pursue careers in science.
[00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:00.420]   For every million dollars a scientist makes,
[00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:03.180]   the businessmen for whom he works make a billion.
[00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:04.460]   For every famous scientist,
[00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:07.080]   there are a thousand famous musicians and actors.
[00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:08.900]   The scientists who made the nuclear bomb
[00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:10.320]   were not the ones to use it.
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.460]   That power belonged to politicians.
[00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:15.900]   And in American culture, scientists have no more popularity
[00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:18.120]   or sex appeal than anyone else.
[00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:20.580]   Thus, this argument not only fails to motivate students,
[00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:22.380]   it actually does the reverse.
[00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:24.780]   A student with no interest in being a scientist
[00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:26.780]   who hears the technology argument
[00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:30.300]   now thinks that advanced math is useful only for scientists.
[00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:32.380]   Thus, he does not need to learn it.
[00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:33.940]   If his goal is personal gain,
[00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:36.680]   his time is better spent doing almost anything else,
[00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:39.220]   studying politics, learning to play the guitar,
[00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:42.280]   working out, or thinking of ways to make himself rich.
[00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:45.700]   Math becomes just an annoying requirement.
[00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:48.700]   So then, why should a student learn math at all?
[00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:51.420]   - Now for a limited time until I'm on motorsports.
[00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:55.060]   - It's financing as low as 1.99% for 36 months
[00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:58.300]   on Select 2023 Can-Am Maverick X3.
[00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.940]   Considering the Mavericks taking home trophies everywhere
[00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:04.380]   from King of the Hammers to Uncle Ned's Backcountry Rally,
[00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:06.300]   you're not going to find a better deal
[00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:09.180]   on front row seats to a championship winner.
[00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:12.300]   Don't lose out on your chance to get a Maverick X3.
[00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:15.900]   Visit Del Amo Motorsports in Redondo Beach and get yours.
[00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:18.580]   Offer in soon, see dealer for details.
[00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:23.800]   Kings used to play chess to learn military strategy.
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:27.020]   When I first heard this at age 10,
[00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:30.380]   the idea struck me as unbelievably stupid.
[00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:33.540]   In chess, the bishop can move only diagonally.
[00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:35.780]   The knight can move in an L shape.
[00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:37.260]   A real soldier, on the other hand,
[00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:38.940]   can move in any direction.
[00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:42.840]   How would studying chess help in any real war?
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:44.820]   I had, of course, completely missed the point.
[00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:48.540]   Strategy has nothing to do with L shapes or diagonals.
[00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:51.420]   A chess player learns to anticipate his opponent.
[00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:53.500]   He learns to look for strong positions
[00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:55.260]   rather than short-term gains.
[00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.500]   He learns to make intelligent sacrifices
[00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:00.740]   and be wary of the strategic artifices of his opponent.
[00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:03.220]   He learns to predict his opponent's future responses
[00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:07.300]   to his actions rather than focusing on the immediate gains.
[00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:09.760]   This mental discipline makes his mind sharper
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:13.060]   and he becomes a much more capable strategist.
[00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:14.980]   Similarly, math is important,
[00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:17.660]   not because it teaches a student how to use trigonometry
[00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:19.380]   to measure the height of a building,
[00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:21.180]   but because it develops a student's ability
[00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:24.420]   to analyze and solve unfamiliar problems.
[00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:26.700]   Math develops concrete reasoning,
[00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:29.600]   spatial reasoning, and logical reasoning.
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.660]   Math does not just develop skills
[00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:34.300]   that can be applied to science and technology.
[00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:35.580]   When math is taught right,
[00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:36.580]   it develops the student's
[00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:39.140]   fundamental cognitive architecture,
[00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:41.220]   increasing his intelligence.
[00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:43.700]   The student will develop the logical reasoning skills
[00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:46.300]   that allow a lawyer to analyze a legal situation
[00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:49.540]   and to present a coherent and convincing argument.
[00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:51.380]   He will develop the ability essential
[00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:53.060]   for any business person to isolate
[00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:55.060]   the key components of a system.
[00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:57.300]   He will develop mental skills that can be used
[00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:59.540]   in any problem-solving situation.
[00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:03.580]   His mind will become faster, sharper, and more precise.
[00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:05.780]   What lifting weights does for muscles,
[00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:07.660]   math does for the mind.
[00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:10.700]   In no sport will an athlete suddenly lie down on his back
[00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:12.640]   and lift a weight 10 times.
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:16.260]   However, the vast majority of athletes do the bench press.
[00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:17.100]   Why?
[00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:19.020]   It makes them stronger and thus prepares them
[00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:21.300]   for athletic endeavors in general.
[00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:23.420]   When you teach a child math in the right way,
[00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:25.380]   you are giving him the gift of a sharper
[00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:27.420]   and more powerful intelligence.
[00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:30.420]   You are helping him actually develop his mind.
[00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:33.020]   You are making him smarter.
[00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:34.820]   You are giving him the ultimate ability
[00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:36.440]   to succeed in the world
[00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:38.820]   and to build a happier life for himself.
[00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:41.380]   You are not just making him better at math,
[00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:43.880]   you are making him better at thinking.
[00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:47.540]   I hope you find that encouraging
[00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:49.840]   and a little bit inspirational.
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:52.540]   When we think about how to make our children smarter,
[00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:55.700]   we have to consider the tools at our disposal.
[00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:58.300]   And that's what I'm trying to give you.
[00:14:58.300 --> 00:14:59.900]   We've talked about the physical tools
[00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:02.540]   to make your children's brains work better,
[00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:06.060]   things like high fat consumption, lots of exercise,
[00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:08.680]   low sugar consumption, et cetera.
[00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:10.720]   But then we pivoted to talking about
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:11.940]   making your children smarter
[00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:13.660]   and more well-informed literacy.
[00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:15.980]   And now we wanna make your children smarter
[00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:17.420]   in terms of building up
[00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:20.020]   not only the physical gray matter of their brain,
[00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:22.020]   but also their thinking ability.
[00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:24.440]   And mathematics is one of the most consistent tools
[00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:26.660]   that we have for that.
[00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:28.100]   I think this is in some ways
[00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:33.100]   because math is analogous to a form of a language.
[00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:36.060]   I think mathematics could be described quite elegantly
[00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:38.680]   as the language of the universe.
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:40.900]   I am persuaded that as a Christian,
[00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:44.820]   I'm persuaded that there's an incredibly useful apologetic
[00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:46.420]   for even the existence of God
[00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:49.540]   in the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics.
[00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:53.060]   When you look at how precisely ordered the universe is
[00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:57.100]   and how beautifully consistently mathematical,
[00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:01.880]   it beggars belief to think that that form of,
[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:06.260]   that language that exists, that is non-physical,
[00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:09.740]   that human beings universally can have access to,
[00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:12.340]   a universal immaterial reality,
[00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:14.300]   such as the language of mathematics,
[00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:17.300]   it almost requires a conception
[00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:20.660]   that there is a beautiful and elegant design.
[00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:22.860]   And mathematics is a language
[00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:24.940]   that as you build fluency in,
[00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:28.380]   it just leads to ever increasing opportunities.
[00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:30.060]   Now, as a language,
[00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:33.200]   I am persuaded that everyone can learn math.
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:36.940]   And I was gonna talk about this later,
[00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:39.020]   but it's important to talk about now.
[00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:41.060]   First, as a disclaimer,
[00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:45.100]   I myself have never been a math teacher,
[00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:49.980]   but I know what it's like to be a struggling student in math
[00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:54.980]   and I know the struggles that I myself faced in doing math.
[00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:59.120]   And I know how those struggles can be resolved.
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:02.320]   So, let's talk about that,
[00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:05.260]   because if you are someone,
[00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:07.360]   there are many people who have had
[00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:11.740]   all of their mathematical appreciation,
[00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:16.700]   their love for mathematics chewed up and destroyed
[00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:18.460]   by the schooling system
[00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:21.140]   that they went through to learn mathematics.
[00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:26.060]   And I think that's unfortunate and unnecessary.
[00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:30.540]   I think that if we understand that math is a language,
[00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:33.100]   just like any language,
[00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:35.700]   it's a language that anyone can speak.
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:39.200]   When you think about your native language,
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:42.000]   assuming it's, let's assume it's English for the moment,
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.160]   you can recognize that there are people
[00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:52.040]   who genuinely have some form of handicap
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:56.720]   that will allow them to never master the English language
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:59.540]   the way that Shakespeare did.
[00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:01.320]   There genuinely are some people
[00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:06.320]   who will never attain that level of linguistic ability.
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:11.220]   But you can also quickly recognize
[00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:15.560]   the reason most people don't attain
[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:18.920]   very high levels of linguistic ability
[00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:23.920]   is not due to a fundamental handicap or disability.
[00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:30.620]   Rather, it's due to not being exposed to high levels
[00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:33.120]   to higher levels of language,
[00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:36.520]   not being trained in the fundamentals necessary
[00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:39.300]   to achieve those high levels of language,
[00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:41.320]   and/or not having the time
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:44.520]   to fully develop their linguistic ability.
[00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:46.920]   Except for a tiny portion of people
[00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:48.880]   who are genuinely disabled,
[00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:54.120]   anybody can become a master of the English language
[00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:58.400]   if given the right materials,
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:02.960]   the right basic tools, and the fullness of time,
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:04.980]   and consistent practice and exposure.
[00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:08.960]   And the rate at which people advance
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:12.440]   in the English language or any language
[00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:16.440]   depends far more on those basic factors
[00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:19.120]   than it does on innate ability.
[00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:22.300]   As you can tell from the previous two episodes,
[00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:26.440]   I myself am quite passionate about literacy,
[00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:28.400]   high levels of literacy.
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.000]   Anybody who listens to my show
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.200]   understands that I'm a quite literate person.
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:35.840]   It's one of the things that harms my ability
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:38.040]   to reach a very broad audience.
[00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:39.800]   It's quite simply, I don't speak
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:42.440]   in a simple or straightforward way.
[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:44.620]   I don't speak at a fifth grade level.
[00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:46.080]   Years ago, I learned a lesson
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:48.180]   when I was studying copywriting,
[00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:49.600]   and the lesson was quite simply
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:53.320]   that in order to write effective, successful sales copy,
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:55.080]   sales letters, et cetera,
[00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:57.680]   you should never use language
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:01.000]   that is higher than that of a fifth grader.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.080]   And because complex language,
[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:08.000]   when used to write sales letters,
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.960]   causes you to lose vast swaths of your audience
[00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:13.360]   and your potential audience.
[00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:19.240]   And where I remember this really standing out to me
[00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:22.800]   was when I saw in prior to the 2016 presidential election
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:26.400]   in the United States, I saw at some point an analysis
[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:28.680]   of then candidate Donald Trump,
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:29.760]   who was running for the office,
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:32.400]   saying he never used more than fifth grade words,
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:35.120]   and he never used large vocabulary.
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:36.400]   And I thought to myself,
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:38.400]   'cause of that connection to sales letters,
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:41.960]   I thought, boom, this guy understands how to reach people
[00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:43.800]   and be an effective politician.
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:47.160]   And so I necessarily understand
[00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:50.160]   that because I use complex language,
[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:53.200]   it limits my ability.
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:57.120]   My goal is not to reach the highest number of people.
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:59.640]   My goal is to reach people that I enjoy talking to
[00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:01.600]   and inspiring those who are looking for more.
[00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:04.800]   So the world of popular level financial advice
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:06.560]   is abundantly well-served.
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:09.520]   I'm seeking to do something more than that.
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:13.300]   My point is, because I'm so passionate about language,
[00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:15.720]   you can see that with my own children
[00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:17.440]   and with students that I mentor, et cetera,
[00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:18.800]   and even with you,
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:21.120]   that I'm seeking to help you
[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:25.600]   to achieve a higher level faster than most other people.
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:28.000]   We use in our homeschool with a first grader
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.880]   and a fourth, third or fourth, fourth grader,
[00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:31.640]   fourth grader, second grader, something like that,
[00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:34.120]   with a nine-year-old and a seven-year-old,
[00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:35.720]   and a five-year-old,
[00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:38.680]   literally read books that are marked
[00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:40.880]   as graduate-level texts,
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:44.160]   as graduate-level in terms of their Lexile scores.
[00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:48.000]   That's intentional because the exposure at a young age
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.320]   creates capability,
[00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:51.680]   and then that capability has a payoff effect
[00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:55.080]   of allowing a student to go much farther, much faster.
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:57.640]   But there was a time at which, of course,
[00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:59.320]   my children could not read.
[00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:01.560]   And it's the same with math.
[00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:03.880]   If we use the right techniques
[00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:07.160]   and we're skillful about how we introduce math
[00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:10.560]   and we establish an appropriate situation,
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:14.560]   we can help our children to go very, very far in math.
[00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:19.560]   And it should be very rare that a child ever thinks,
[00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:22.280]   "Oh, I'm just not good at math."
[00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:24.760]   In what I've described in terms of literacy,
[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:26.480]   I've had children that have learned to read
[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:29.040]   at different rates and have struggled with different things.
[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:34.040]   That is normal, but we can and must adapt then what we do
[00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:39.860]   to meet the specific needs of our students.
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:44.560]   But what we must not do is somehow think
[00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:46.840]   that because they have a brain
[00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:48.320]   that works slightly differently
[00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:52.040]   or because they need a special aid of some kind
[00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:53.240]   or they need a little bit longer
[00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:55.360]   to learn the basic concepts,
[00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:57.160]   that somehow we should stop.
[00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:59.680]   We don't stop teaching our children to read
[00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:03.280]   just because it takes one child two years
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:04.840]   instead of two months.
[00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:07.760]   Just like we don't stop encouraging our children to walk
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:09.960]   just because one child walks at three years old,
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:12.160]   another child walks at eight months.
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:14.480]   We're going to continue,
[00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:16.400]   you're gonna continue working with your child
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:18.100]   until he walks.
[00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:19.880]   You're going to continue working with your child
[00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:21.480]   until he reads.
[00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:25.240]   And you must continue working with your child
[00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:29.040]   until he is skilled with mathematics.
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:33.280]   Mathematics is a language that is accessible to all people.
[00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:35.860]   And it doesn't matter the rate
[00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:38.080]   at which the language is acquired.
[00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:39.800]   What matters is that the language
[00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:43.800]   is being progressively acquired.
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:45.800]   And like languages,
[00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:46.860]   languages are one of those things
[00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:49.500]   where it's very hard to get worse at languages.
[00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:53.440]   Once you have developed linguistic ability,
[00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:55.260]   it's very hard to get worse.
[00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:57.320]   Sometimes your progress feels fast,
[00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:59.640]   sometimes your progress feels slow,
[00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:02.420]   but you don't generally get worse.
[00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:04.960]   If you do get worse, right,
[00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:07.320]   say you don't use a language at all for five years,
[00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:08.960]   when you come back to the language,
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:11.640]   in very short time, you quickly reach your ability
[00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:13.740]   and then move on from there.
[00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:15.740]   So math is a language
[00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:17.960]   and it's important to exercise it
[00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:20.820]   consistently and ongoing over time.
[00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:25.760]   Math is also very useful as a discipline.
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:27.040]   It's a discipline.
[00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:30.600]   Math is generally, for at least for me,
[00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:33.120]   and I think for everyone else, math is hard.
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:37.320]   And hard is something that is good.
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:39.140]   Hard is useful.
[00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:43.000]   I've talked in past episodes
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.780]   about educational philosophies.
[00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:49.200]   And one of the things that I have appreciated over the years
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:50.880]   is I've appreciated many of the comments
[00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:54.720]   that those who maintain the educational philosophy
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:59.000]   of unschooling, I appreciate the comments
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.800]   and many of the critiques that they make of schooling.
[00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:04.000]   The basic critique would come down to,
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.040]   if you're gonna learn something,
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:07.500]   you need to actually care about it and want to learn it.
[00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:09.900]   Otherwise, you don't really ever learn it.
[00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:11.120]   They point out that the things
[00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:12.540]   that we learn the most effectively
[00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:14.120]   are the things that we want to learn.
[00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:15.620]   And I think that's true.
[00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:19.440]   But I myself am not an unschooler, excuse me,
[00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:23.400]   I'm not an unschooler because I fear
[00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:25.960]   that unschooling does not provide
[00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:30.620]   an appropriate structure for character formation.
[00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:34.440]   Now, character can be formed in many ways.
[00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:37.880]   Generally though, at its core,
[00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:42.120]   character is formed by difficulty.
[00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:46.080]   And we want to require our children
[00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:50.720]   to do difficult things each and every single day
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:55.480]   of their life in order that they develop the skill
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:58.860]   of facing and doing difficult things.
[00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:01.740]   A man who does not have the skill
[00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:04.460]   of doing things that he doesn't wanna do
[00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:06.340]   is a man who will have a very hard time
[00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:08.260]   being successful in life.
[00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:11.640]   Now, as parents, we go to our toolbox
[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:13.460]   and we say, what tools do I have?
[00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:18.460]   Perhaps a man who has a farm or some form of lifestyle
[00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:20.060]   where there's heavy physical labor
[00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:22.860]   can use that heavy physical labor as the tool
[00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:26.300]   for developing the skill set of hard work.
[00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:28.380]   That's certainly something that I think many people
[00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:31.900]   notice that can happen well in farming economies.
[00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:34.260]   But we no longer live in an agrarian economy.
[00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:37.620]   And so that tool is often not very effective for us.
[00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:39.420]   Maybe if you live in the frozen north,
[00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:41.700]   your tool can be the hard thing we're gonna do every day
[00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:44.620]   is go jump in the frozen lake and have cold exposure.
[00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:46.520]   Okay, maybe that's useful.
[00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:49.540]   But for many of us in an information age
[00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:52.320]   and in an intellectual world, we need something hard
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:55.540]   and that's probably gonna be something like,
[00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:58.340]   it's gonna be something intellectual.
[00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:02.180]   And so in order to help our children develop
[00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:05.300]   that character skill to do hard things,
[00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:06.800]   we need to have something hard to do.
[00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:09.580]   And math is an ideal candidate for that.
[00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:11.900]   It's not the only candidate for that.
[00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:14.200]   I think that there can be other things.
[00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:15.740]   I'm now going to read you an essay
[00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:19.740]   from a book called "Climbing Parnassus."
[00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:22.780]   And it's called "Climbing Parnassus,
[00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:26.780]   a New Apologia for Greek and Latin" by Tracey Lee Simmons.
[00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:30.220]   And this book is trying to encourage people
[00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:34.300]   to use Greek and Latin and gain the benefits
[00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:37.820]   that many centuries of classically educated students
[00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:39.740]   have gained from them.
[00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:41.280]   I'm gonna read to you a section here
[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:44.060]   that's talking about the value of the struggle
[00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:46.300]   to learn Greek and Latin.
[00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:51.300]   I believe though that this applies first to mathematics.
[00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:53.340]   While perhaps there is value
[00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:55.620]   in studying Greek and Latin, perhaps,
[00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:58.260]   and perhaps this author is completely right,
[00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:00.020]   one of the great challenges for many of us
[00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:03.820]   is simply we have never gone through that challenge
[00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:04.660]   ourselves.
[00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:10.060]   I myself was never exposed to Greek and Latin as a child.
[00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:13.940]   I didn't have the experience that these authors have.
[00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:17.860]   Nor is it easy for me as a father to find tutors
[00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:20.540]   and teachers that can impose this type
[00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:23.460]   of disciplined character building structure
[00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:25.300]   onto my children.
[00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:29.340]   But I believe mathematics can accomplish the same thing.
[00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:32.780]   And most of us can impose a disciplined
[00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:34.460]   mathematical structure on our children
[00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:36.580]   to gain these benefits.
[00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:39.780]   Enjoy this excerpt here from "Climbing Parnassus."
[00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:41.900]   You may wish to, you may be inspired
[00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:43.480]   and you may wish to use Greek and Latin,
[00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:45.940]   but think of mathematics as I read this.
[00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:49.740]   W.H. Auden was one of many writers
[00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:51.020]   of the last great generation
[00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:52.860]   of classically educated men and women,
[00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:55.540]   upon whom an early classical training
[00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:59.540]   made indelible impressions, intellectual and otherwise.
[00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:01.780]   Those boyish classroom exercises
[00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:03.740]   had formed his very sensibility.
[00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:07.620]   And he lived to see the stupid, numbing consensus arise
[00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:10.060]   that a classical education holds scant value
[00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:11.820]   for the modern world.
[00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:14.140]   The modern revolt against centering the school curriculum
[00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:16.740]   around the study of Latin and Greek is understandable
[00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:19.340]   in an age of hyper utilitarianism, he wrote,
[00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:21.620]   though it's deplorably mistaken.
[00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:24.820]   It is no doubt a pleasure to read the Greek and Latin poets,
[00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:27.420]   philosophers and historians in the original,
[00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:30.140]   but very few persons so educated in the past
[00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:33.240]   kept up their Greek and Latin after leaving school.
[00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:35.340]   The real value of classics though
[00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:36.940]   is something quite different.
[00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:38.980]   Anybody who has spent many hours in his youth
[00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:42.540]   translating into and out of two languages
[00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:45.900]   so syntactically and rhetorically different from his own,
[00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:48.740]   learns something about his mother tongue,
[00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:51.700]   which I do not think can be learned in any other way.
[00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:55.020]   It inculcates the habit, whenever one uses a word,
[00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:58.460]   of automatically asking what is its exact meaning.
[00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:03.140]   Auden's case for classics was not so much the cultural one,
[00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:05.340]   but the case from formation.
[00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:07.140]   The pursuit of classics per se
[00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:09.620]   is worth all the devotion we can lend it.
[00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:11.220]   Classical knowledge provides keys
[00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:13.540]   to understanding Western civilization,
[00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:16.060]   but the habits Greek and Latin instill
[00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:18.340]   are worth at least as much.
[00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:20.300]   The passing of classics from our schools
[00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:22.740]   has in fact crippled the larger culture.
[00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:26.220]   Here, Auden cast his net far and wide.
[00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:27.540]   The people who have really suffered
[00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:30.580]   since classical education became undemocratic
[00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:32.860]   are not the novelists and poets.
[00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:35.860]   Their natural love of languages sees them through.
[00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:39.060]   But all those, like politicians, journalists, lawyers,
[00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:40.620]   the man in the street, et cetera,
[00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:44.540]   who use language for everyday and non-literary purposes.
[00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:47.540]   Among such, one observes an appalling deterioration
[00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:50.300]   in precision and conciseness.
[00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:53.020]   - Now for a limited time at Delamo Motorsports.
[00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:56.700]   Get financing as low as 1.99% for 36 months
[00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:59.940]   on Select 2023 Can-Am Maverick X3.
[00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:02.580]   Considering the Mavericks taking home trophies everywhere,
[00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:06.020]   from King of the Hammers to Uncle Ned's Backcountry Rally,
[00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:07.940]   you're not going to find a better deal
[00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:10.860]   on front row seats to a championship winner.
[00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:13.980]   Don't lose out on your chance to get a Maverick X3.
[00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:17.580]   Visit Delamo Motorsports in Redondo Beach and get yours.
[00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:20.260]   Offer in soon, see dealer for details.
[00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:25.020]   - How ironic that those democratic fears of elitism
[00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:27.740]   should ensure that those born without the privileges
[00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:31.500]   of the educated classes will remain permanently disabled,
[00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:34.220]   victims of others' good intentions.
[00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:36.820]   The signs of rot surround us.
[00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:40.780]   Nobody, Auden wrote, who had had a classical education
[00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:44.420]   could have perpetuated this sentence in "The New Yorker."
[00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:47.980]   He, a film director, expresses that dichotomy
[00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:51.620]   between man and woman in the images of the bra and dachau.
[00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:53.780]   One would hope not.
[00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:55.820]   That's the murky self-important lingo
[00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:58.300]   emanating from the lit crit sentiment are
[00:31:58.300 --> 00:31:59.900]   in English departments.
[00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:01.900]   It doesn't exist to communicate anything
[00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:03.460]   to the cultivated mind.
[00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:07.860]   It exists to confuse and impress easily bamboozled,
[00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:11.180]   uneducated, fee-paying sycophants.
[00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:15.660]   It pretends to profundity, but it's tripe.
[00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:19.980]   Language like this is not hatched for civilized people.
[00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:22.660]   Perhaps we can have culture of a kind
[00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:24.780]   without bestowing classical education
[00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:27.420]   upon a goodly number of intelligent men and women.
[00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:30.100]   We may doubt whether we can have a literary culture
[00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:32.020]   whose roots run deep.
[00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:33.780]   Novelist Evelyn Waugh paid tribute
[00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:35.300]   to his own classical training.
[00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:38.420]   Here we see plainly that the oft-heard cry
[00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:40.300]   that students retain little of their Latin
[00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:41.700]   misses the point.
[00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:42.820]   A classical training,
[00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:45.060]   thoroughly conducted along humanistic lines,
[00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:47.460]   changes the shape of the mind for the better.
[00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:49.540]   It stays with us.
[00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:50.900]   My knowledge of English literature
[00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:53.100]   derived chiefly from my home.
[00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:55.660]   Most of my hours in the form room for 10 years
[00:32:55.660 --> 00:32:57.540]   had been spent on Latin and Greek,
[00:32:57.540 --> 00:32:59.460]   history and mathematics.
[00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:01.420]   Today, I remember no Greek.
[00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:02.900]   I have never read Latin for pleasure
[00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:06.180]   and should now be hard put to compose a simple epitaph.
[00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:08.940]   But I do not regret my superficial,
[00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:12.020]   superficial for the time perhaps, classical studies.
[00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:15.060]   I believe that the conventional defense of them is valid.
[00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:17.620]   That only by them can a boy fully understand
[00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:19.900]   that a sentence is a logical construction
[00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:23.340]   and that words have basic inalienable meanings,
[00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:25.980]   departure from which is either conscious metaphor
[00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:28.580]   or inexcusable vulgarity.
[00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:30.620]   Those who have not been so taught,
[00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:32.340]   most Americans and most women,
[00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:34.660]   unless they are guided by some rare genius,
[00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:36.700]   betray their deprivation.
[00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:39.460]   The old fashioned test of an English sentence,
[00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:40.620]   will it translate?
[00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:44.940]   Still stands after we have lost the trick of translation.
[00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:47.900]   We should note here as well,
[00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:50.660]   the starkly limited curriculum.
[00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:53.460]   His schoolmasters might have chosen to clutter the classroom
[00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:54.900]   with far shinier objects
[00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:57.700]   than it did in the second decade of the 20th century.
[00:33:57.700 --> 00:33:59.140]   Commercial French for one thing,
[00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:02.340]   or aerodynamics or wood shop.
[00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:05.820]   That world was changing after all, true enough.
[00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:06.940]   But that didn't mean
[00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:09.820]   that the well-constituted mind had changed.
[00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:12.740]   The intellect still required molding.
[00:34:12.740 --> 00:34:15.180]   The better schools then, as they ought to be now,
[00:34:15.180 --> 00:34:17.780]   were eager primarily to form the student's mind,
[00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:20.380]   imparting solid knowledge mainly
[00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:23.060]   as a by-product of sound teaching.
[00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:24.780]   As with the Greek and Roman schools
[00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:26.260]   so many centuries before,
[00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:29.100]   the curriculum of Wauw's school was also marked
[00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:30.420]   as H.I. Meru wrote,
[00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:34.900]   "By a definite rejection of what it did not include."
[00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:36.900]   What it didn't let in was of equal importance
[00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:38.220]   to what it did.
[00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:39.540]   Any school we might conclude
[00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:41.340]   with more than four or five subjects
[00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:43.580]   doesn't know what it wants to be.
[00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:47.740]   Or we may shudder to think, perhaps it does.
[00:34:47.740 --> 00:34:49.740]   Most public schools in America now strive
[00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:51.580]   to be cut rate educational malls
[00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:53.340]   for the intellectually lame.
[00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:54.980]   Whether or not students first darken
[00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:56.660]   the school doors that way.
[00:34:56.660 --> 00:34:58.180]   So most of them leave,
[00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:00.060]   while even some private schools pose
[00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:02.100]   as little more than colorful felt boards
[00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:04.980]   for the earnestly shallow, commonly confusing,
[00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:08.060]   pious or patriotic piffle with real education.
[00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:09.900]   Neither setup makes for a school
[00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:13.460]   any educated human being is bound to respect.
[00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:16.100]   Schools of the best kind have always aimed high
[00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:18.020]   while keeping feet to the ground.
[00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:20.380]   They didn't try to do too much.
[00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:23.500]   They tried to do the most important things.
[00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:26.540]   Those who ran them knew that we educate ourselves
[00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:29.460]   with the tools imparted by good teachers.
[00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:31.420]   All else was up to us.
[00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:33.300]   The old schoolmasters didn't profess
[00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:35.460]   to teach everything worth knowing.
[00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:37.980]   Instead, they professed the opposite.
[00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:42.020]   They shaped their curricula narrowly and wisely.
[00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:44.820]   Information alone is not knowledge as they knew.
[00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:47.300]   Still less is it wisdom.
[00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:48.860]   Schools can accomplish much more
[00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:51.860]   when they recognize squarely how little they can do.
[00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:55.180]   Yet how much more can be done when our gaze remains steady,
[00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:58.180]   our heads sober, our aims high?
[00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:01.900]   No results are guaranteed, but the effort pays off.
[00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:04.220]   Formed minds and tempered souls
[00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:06.780]   are no small gift to the world.
[00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:09.540]   Let's see one more example of how good schooling goes bad
[00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:11.740]   through wishful thinking pedagogy.
[00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:14.740]   Perhaps the school should be, as we might say now,
[00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:16.500]   a challenging place.
[00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:18.180]   It should be hard.
[00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:21.740]   The work enjoined upon us should help us to develop,
[00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:25.580]   not only by its content, but also by its method,
[00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:29.140]   the mind capable of teaching itself anything.
[00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:32.860]   It's not so much an informed mind we seek,
[00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:35.580]   the one full of information for an information age,
[00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:37.980]   making us little more than worker bees,
[00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:41.500]   but a certain quality of mind,
[00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:44.540]   a mind at once agile and civilized,
[00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:47.180]   one able to place the society to which it belongs
[00:36:47.180 --> 00:36:49.540]   into some scheme of history.
[00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:53.100]   We want not only a well-stored mind,
[00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:56.500]   but a well-leavened mind as well.
[00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:57.580]   So what of it?
[00:36:57.580 --> 00:37:00.100]   This may be a good enough idea as ideas go,
[00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:03.100]   yet we must emerge from school doors knowing something,
[00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:04.740]   but what should we know?
[00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:07.140]   An answer sits at the ready.
[00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:11.820]   We should learn how to appreciate the better things of life.
[00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:13.140]   And so we should.
[00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:15.980]   The snare here, the snake in the grass waiting to bite,
[00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:20.100]   is that this idea has led us down some false paths.
[00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:23.020]   Appreciation squares with Renaissance ideals,
[00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:25.420]   but as conceived by us moderns,
[00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:29.140]   it's miles away from Renaissance methods.
[00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:31.460]   Today, we don't lack teachers and theorists
[00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:33.140]   wishing to help students pull off
[00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:35.140]   an enhanced quality of mind.
[00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:37.100]   Many have tipped their hats to this principle
[00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:40.100]   by designing courses whose purpose is to help those students
[00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:41.460]   not so much to know,
[00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:44.700]   but to appreciate the world around them.
[00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:48.020]   Yet this isn't the learning Vittorino da Feltre knew.
[00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:49.980]   We don't need under this regime
[00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:53.660]   to learn the hard things about poetry or music or art.
[00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:57.820]   We need only to appreciate them as poetry, music, or art.
[00:37:57.820 --> 00:38:00.300]   We need only to acknowledge their value.
[00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:01.860]   While it's easy to make fun of this attitude,
[00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:04.420]   we should recognize that in the ablest hands,
[00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:07.140]   the quality of mind sought is a decent goal,
[00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:09.220]   and doubtless it's sometimes achieved.
[00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:11.700]   Poetry, music, and art were not created after all
[00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:14.260]   to provide fodder for tests in school.
[00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:17.460]   Poetry is more than scansion and difficult words,
[00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:19.740]   music more than scales and arpeggios,
[00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:23.380]   and art more than cracked vases and spatial perspective.
[00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:26.060]   All three were made to delight.
[00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:29.740]   They were meant to please us in some deep or diverting way.
[00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:31.540]   This we must acknowledge.
[00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:33.780]   But however good the object of helping young people
[00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:36.500]   to take easy the light and the fine things around them,
[00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:39.220]   this approach to forming the rough, formless mind
[00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:41.580]   is also profoundly wrongheaded.
[00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:44.500]   C.S. Lewis helps us to see why in a little known essay
[00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:48.500]   called "The Parthenon and the Optative."
[00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:49.980]   "The trouble with these boys,"
[00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:51.740]   said a grim old classical scholar
[00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:54.460]   looking up from some milk and watery entrance papers
[00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:55.940]   which he had been marking,
[00:38:55.940 --> 00:38:57.980]   "The trouble with these boys is that the masters
[00:38:57.980 --> 00:39:00.260]   have been talking to them about the Parthenon
[00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:01.660]   when they should have been talking to them
[00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:03.460]   about the optative."
[00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:06.900]   The optative is one of the moods of the Greek verb.
[00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:09.540]   "Ever since then, I have tended to use the Parthenon
[00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:13.940]   and the optative as the symbols of two types of education.
[00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:16.740]   The one begins with hard, dry things
[00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:19.740]   like grammar and dates and prosody,
[00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:21.460]   and it has at least the chance of ending
[00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:24.260]   in a real appreciation, which is equally hard and firm,
[00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:26.140]   though not equally dry.
[00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:31.020]   The other begins in appreciation and ends in gush.
[00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:33.220]   When the first fails, it has, at the very least,
[00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:35.940]   taught the boy what knowledge is like.
[00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:38.340]   He may decide that he doesn't care for knowledge,
[00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:40.380]   but he knows he doesn't care for it
[00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:42.580]   and he knows he hasn't got it.
[00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:44.620]   But the other fails most disastrously
[00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:48.460]   when it most succeeds.
[00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:51.700]   It teaches a man to feel vaguely cultured
[00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:54.100]   while he remains, in fact, a dunce.
[00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:57.940]   It makes him think he is enjoying poems he can't construe.
[00:39:57.940 --> 00:40:00.900]   It qualifies him to review books he does not understand
[00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:04.660]   and to be intellectual without intellect.
[00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:07.140]   It plays havoc with the very distinction
[00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:09.740]   between truth and error.
[00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:12.700]   This is what school has become for us
[00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:15.260]   over the haul of three or four generations.
[00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:17.420]   It's become not so much about knowledge
[00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:21.180]   as it has about experience.
[00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:25.620]   The teacher doesn't teach, the teacher facilitates.
[00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:28.420]   Instead of providing solid instruction, for instance,
[00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:30.540]   about the cathedral at Chartres,
[00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:33.180]   about its religious significance and dates and place
[00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:35.420]   in French geography and dimensions
[00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:37.860]   and Gothic architectural principles,
[00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:41.540]   the things that is, we can really know about it,
[00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:44.500]   the teacher is now just as likely to stand before a class
[00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:46.140]   with a photograph of the cathedral
[00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:50.420]   and ask students to respond to it.
[00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:52.740]   What does it make you think of?
[00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:55.660]   Would you want to walk into a building like this?
[00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:59.260]   Are all these statues beautiful or ugly?
[00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:01.740]   Would a woman be comfortable here?
[00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:04.700]   Write a paragraph on what you think it must have felt like
[00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:06.140]   to stand in front of it.
[00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:09.340]   I jest, but only a little.
[00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:11.580]   Here is how we are set on the high road
[00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:14.060]   to the Parthenon kind of education,
[00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:16.300]   the kind that will, by its very method,
[00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:20.420]   allow us later to think we know more than we do.
[00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:23.140]   These questions might not make a bad exercise
[00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:28.100]   for kindergartners, but they're unfit for anyone older.
[00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:29.620]   One year hence, the students' time
[00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:32.260]   will be better spent memorizing Roman numerals.
[00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:35.500]   Yet much schooling today, even high schooling,
[00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:38.540]   has become every bit as vapid
[00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:41.660]   as this whimsical example suggests.
[00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:43.860]   Here, before the young can know the dangers
[00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:46.900]   of soft teaching or the seductions of ignorance,
[00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:49.900]   non-knowledge gets planted and watered,
[00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:52.740]   and left unchecked, as it usually is,
[00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:54.520]   it will spread like bamboo.
[00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:57.060]   Lewis goes on.
[00:41:57.060 --> 00:41:59.240]   And yet education of the Parthenon type
[00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:00.620]   is often recommended by those
[00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:02.700]   who have and love real learning.
[00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:07.220]   They are moved by a kind of false reverence for the muses.
[00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:09.140]   What they value, say, in literature,
[00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:12.860]   seems to them so delicate and spiritual a thing
[00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:16.100]   that they cannot bear to see it, as they think,
[00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:19.320]   degraded by such coarse mechanic attendance
[00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:24.320]   as paradigms, blackboards, marks, and examination papers.
[00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:27.580]   But there is a profound misunderstanding here.
[00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:29.620]   These well-meaning educationalists
[00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:32.580]   are quite right in thinking that literary appreciation
[00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:34.220]   is a delicate thing.
[00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:37.580]   What they do not seem to see is that for this very reason,
[00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:40.340]   elementary examinations on literary subjects
[00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:44.260]   ought to confine themselves to just those dry
[00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:49.060]   and factual questions, which are so often ridiculed.
[00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:52.540]   The questions were never supposed to test appreciation.
[00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:53.900]   The idea was to find out
[00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:56.340]   whether the boy had read his books.
[00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:58.840]   It was the reading, not the being examined,
[00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:01.060]   which was expected to do him good.
[00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:05.680]   And this, so far from being a defect in such examinations,
[00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:09.780]   is just what renders them useful or even tolerable.
[00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:14.500]   Lewis sees learning in a word, objectively.
[00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:16.680]   If progress in learning can't be measured
[00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:18.380]   for purposes of schooling,
[00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:20.980]   we have no way of knowing if it's happening at all.
[00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:22.780]   Knowledge can be measured.
[00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:24.660]   Appreciation cannot.
[00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:27.740]   Furthermore, trying to test pleasure or approval
[00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:30.700]   may prove hazardous even to the soul itself.
[00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:34.140]   Tell the boy to mug up, which means study up on,
[00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:36.520]   tell the boy to mug up a book
[00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:39.580]   and then set questions to find out whether he has done so.
[00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:41.020]   At best, he may have learned,
[00:43:41.020 --> 00:43:44.540]   and best of all, unconsciously, to enjoy a great poem.
[00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:46.780]   At second best, he has done an honest piece of work
[00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:49.180]   and exercised his memory and reason.
[00:43:49.180 --> 00:43:50.860]   At worst, we've done him no harm,
[00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:53.340]   have not pawed and dabbled in his soul,
[00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:56.340]   have not taught him to be a prig or a hypocrite,
[00:43:56.340 --> 00:43:59.820]   but an elementary examination which attempts to assess
[00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:03.940]   the adventure of the soul among books is a dangerous thing.
[00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:06.240]   What obsequious boys, if encouraged,
[00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:09.260]   will try to manufacture and clever ones can ape
[00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:10.860]   and shy ones will conceal,
[00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:13.140]   what dies at the touch of venality
[00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:16.180]   is called to come forward and perform,
[00:44:16.180 --> 00:44:19.840]   to exhibit itself at that very stage when it's timid,
[00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:21.380]   half-conscious stirrings
[00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:24.340]   can least endure such self-consciousness.
[00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:28.580]   If the tenets of formation ought to guide method
[00:44:28.580 --> 00:44:32.820]   in our schools, we also see what content must be.
[00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:36.120]   It must be hard and intractable.
[00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:37.820]   It's import significant.
[00:44:37.820 --> 00:44:40.540]   It's substance learnable.
[00:44:40.540 --> 00:44:42.680]   Content is, in one sense at least,
[00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:46.360]   the bar we use to pull ourselves out of ignorance.
[00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:50.940]   The formed and forming mind is the muscle we use to pull.
[00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:55.560]   Appreciation may be properly valued above solid knowledge.
[00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:58.420]   The best kind accompanies us into our sunset years.
[00:44:58.420 --> 00:45:01.540]   Appreciation, inward apprehension and assent
[00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:03.940]   touches upon the spiritual in our natures.
[00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:06.280]   It is indeed to be sought vigorously.
[00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:09.180]   The only real quandary is how to get there.
[00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:11.500]   And Lewis, like so many before him,
[00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:13.700]   knew that while the long way round,
[00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:17.500]   the way of the optative may not guarantee a rival
[00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:19.420]   at the port of our desires.
[00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:21.620]   Nonetheless, it is the one way
[00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:24.220]   that weather-hardened sea-legged mariners
[00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:27.500]   have tested and found to be not only reliable,
[00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:31.780]   but given the winds tossing us, safe.
[00:45:31.780 --> 00:45:34.980]   Multum non multa.
[00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:37.960]   This is the one chart we can trust.
[00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:43.940]   Again, I understand that Greek and Latin
[00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:46.100]   were the object of that sentence,
[00:45:46.100 --> 00:45:50.340]   but I think it's hard to believe that most of us
[00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:54.860]   are either desirous or equipped today
[00:45:54.860 --> 00:45:58.260]   to go to our children and impose upon them
[00:45:58.260 --> 00:46:02.260]   the hard pathway of Greek and Latin
[00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:05.180]   and deeply probing the optative.
[00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:08.760]   Most of us are not equipped and we may have other concerns.
[00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:14.820]   But I think mathematics provides us with so much of that.
[00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:19.220]   And while many of us may be skeptical about Greek and Latin
[00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:22.060]   being the core of a child's education,
[00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:26.300]   I think far fewer of us are skeptical about mathematics
[00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:29.780]   being the core of a child's education.
[00:46:29.780 --> 00:46:32.100]   And so we want to do hard things
[00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:36.980]   and we want to use the tools at our disposal.
[00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:40.900]   One quote from a different part of the book.
[00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:44.300]   "There is a time for play and a time for work.
[00:46:44.300 --> 00:46:47.060]   "School can be an enriching, enjoyable place,
[00:46:47.060 --> 00:46:48.880]   "and a place some students may look forward
[00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:50.500]   "to attending every day.
[00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:53.720]   "Those are fortunate children with fortunate parents.
[00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:57.200]   "But children's approval should not be our first concern.
[00:46:57.200 --> 00:46:59.860]   "Like a healing doctor, we know this will hurt.
[00:46:59.860 --> 00:47:01.660]   "We might as well say so.
[00:47:01.660 --> 00:47:05.100]   "School should be a serious place.
[00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:08.240]   "Dullards must not set the pace.
[00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:10.700]   "Students should be encouraged to develop a sense
[00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:13.900]   "of their smallness alongside the world's riches.
[00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:18.140]   "Humility remains a decent aim for the well-educated mind.
[00:47:18.140 --> 00:47:20.440]   "Let us not try to do too much.
[00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:23.320]   "Those subjects that can be got outside school doors,
[00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:25.220]   "things like fashion design, computer training,
[00:47:25.220 --> 00:47:27.260]   "and photography should be.
[00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:30.300]   "Dissipation of effort can lead to despair.
[00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:31.760]   "The world outside will catch up
[00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:33.420]   "with the young soon enough.
[00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:37.600]   "School ought to be a training ground for the intellect,
[00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:41.180]   "not a clearinghouse for skills.
[00:47:41.180 --> 00:47:43.540]   "And if it's to be the latter, we should admit it.
[00:47:43.540 --> 00:47:45.640]   "Whatever we decide to teach young people
[00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:48.580]   "who will one day step forward to run the world.
[00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:53.360]   "And why should we teach anything other than languages,
[00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:57.980]   "mathematics, and geography before the age of 13?
[00:47:57.980 --> 00:47:59.680]   "Let's remember as the humanists taught
[00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:01.400]   "that we reap as we sow.
[00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:05.980]   "These are human beings equipped both with minds and souls.
[00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:09.080]   "Bend their twigs, we must,
[00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:12.420]   "just so they grow hale and well."
[00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:18.420]   Mathematics is perhaps our most useful tool
[00:48:18.420 --> 00:48:22.400]   to teach our children discipline
[00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:28.240]   so that they can do something hard every single day.
[00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:33.120]   Now, just because it's hard does not mean
[00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:34.500]   that we don't want them to succeed.
[00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:38.580]   So what is necessary for mathematical success?
[00:48:38.580 --> 00:48:41.400]   Well, first, let me share with you my story.
[00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:45.560]   I was not good at math when I was younger.
[00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:49.440]   The reason I was not good was probably
[00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:52.440]   because my math skills were neglected.
[00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:56.600]   My parents tried, I was homeschooled, they did their best.
[00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:58.700]   But although I was encouraged
[00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:01.560]   and required to learn my math facts,
[00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:03.900]   I never really mastered them.
[00:49:03.900 --> 00:49:07.200]   I wasn't required to drill them until mastery.
[00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:09.560]   When I was younger, I did a math curriculum
[00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:12.480]   that was probably fine, and then we switched.
[00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:15.040]   And at one point, I cheated on my math work
[00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:16.720]   for months and months.
[00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:18.320]   My mom was traveling for a time,
[00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:20.320]   my grandmother was overseeing my schooling
[00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:23.200]   at one particular time, and I discovered
[00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:25.400]   that I could just go and take the answer key
[00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:30.400]   from my mom's desk and just copy down the answers.
[00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:32.800]   And I was able to successfully fool my grandmother
[00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:34.280]   into thinking that I had done all my work.
[00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:35.720]   And my mom eventually figured out
[00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:37.000]   that I had just flat out cheated,
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.540]   and I confessed and whatnot, but I got behind.
[00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:40.840]   So I got behind.
[00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:43.200]   When I went into school in seventh grade
[00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:46.800]   into a local, more traditional private school,
[00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:48.760]   I was woefully behind.
[00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:50.880]   In fact, my mom had to work hard
[00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:52.280]   to try to get them to accept me
[00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:56.000]   because I did not pass the math tests sufficiently.
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.760]   My first year in mathematics,
[00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:03.760]   I got a D the first semester, so I was barely passing.
[00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:06.640]   I was reasonably smart, but I was barely passing.
[00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:09.440]   I didn't get an F, but I was barely passing.
[00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:12.160]   So then my dad took me under his wing,
[00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:14.120]   and he considered it unacceptable
[00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:16.040]   that one of his children should not do that,
[00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:18.160]   and he imposed certain requirements on me.
[00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:21.600]   I forget all of them, but one of the requirements
[00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:25.280]   was that I had to review my homework with him.
[00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:28.280]   I think I had to bring him every test that I went through,
[00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:29.760]   and basically, he just took a strong interest
[00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:31.840]   in my mathematical abilities.
[00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:34.400]   So I got a D the first quarter, a C the next quarter,
[00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:36.760]   B the end of that quarter, and then from then,
[00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:37.760]   I was able to get Bs.
[00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:39.680]   I kind of caught up Bs and As,
[00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:43.120]   and I think I mostly got As, either high Bs or low As,
[00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:44.940]   throughout my high school years.
[00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:49.480]   But I was never really great at math.
[00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:53.160]   I did pass through algebra, trigonometry, geometry, et cetera
[00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:55.200]   through to calculus, and I took calculus
[00:50:55.200 --> 00:50:57.280]   my senior year in high school.
[00:50:57.280 --> 00:51:02.280]   And I think I did okay on the grade portion,
[00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:04.840]   but when it came time to take the AP exam
[00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:07.520]   at the end of the year, I got a two on my AP exam,
[00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:09.960]   which is a failure on, so I failed my AP exam,
[00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:11.760]   never got calculus credit.
[00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:14.240]   When I went into college, my freshman year of college,
[00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:16.000]   I was required to take a math course,
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:19.040]   and I, because I had not passed the AP exam,
[00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:21.380]   and I figured, well, I'll take calculus again.
[00:51:21.380 --> 00:51:24.740]   And I took calculus, and I passed calculus.
[00:51:24.740 --> 00:51:26.760]   I don't know whether I got a B or a C,
[00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:29.080]   but to this day, I still have nightmares,
[00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:30.180]   and I'm not kidding.
[00:51:30.180 --> 00:51:32.640]   I'm not nor am I being hyperbolic.
[00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:37.080]   I still have nightmares about math,
[00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:38.440]   because that calculus class,
[00:51:38.440 --> 00:51:40.320]   I basically just made it up as I went along,
[00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:42.160]   and I never really learned it.
[00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:44.360]   I'd never learned calculus.
[00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:46.860]   I was able to pass exams enough,
[00:51:46.860 --> 00:51:48.320]   but I never learned calculus,
[00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:50.080]   and I know I never learned it,
[00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:51.480]   because I felt guilty about it,
[00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:55.880]   and I knew that I was insufficiently prepared for it.
[00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:57.500]   Now, in hindsight, I can look back,
[00:51:57.500 --> 00:52:00.480]   and I can see very clearly what went wrong.
[00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:03.240]   And what went wrong was I never did nearly enough math
[00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:05.320]   for me to succeed at math.
[00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:08.600]   First, I never did nearly enough of the day in, day out,
[00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:11.560]   nuts and bolts of arithmetic to master my math facts.
[00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:15.640]   Now, I eventually did master them in high school,
[00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:16.840]   but that was far too late.
[00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:18.920]   I should have mastered them by third grade.
[00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:20.980]   And by master, I mean master them.
[00:52:20.980 --> 00:52:26.000]   Math facts, one of the most fundamentally important things
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:28.820]   for children to succeed in mathematics
[00:52:28.820 --> 00:52:33.820]   is that they have absolute and total mastery over math facts.
[00:52:33.820 --> 00:52:35.580]   Later in this episode, I'm gonna talk to you
[00:52:35.580 --> 00:52:39.140]   about perhaps the inadvisability of doing math too young.
[00:52:39.140 --> 00:52:43.740]   That said, I don't think that there's an age
[00:52:43.740 --> 00:52:46.580]   at which it's too young to do math facts.
[00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:48.780]   So teaching math facts and ensuring
[00:52:48.780 --> 00:52:51.580]   that your children know their math facts,
[00:52:51.580 --> 00:52:52.900]   and by math facts, let me define it,
[00:52:52.900 --> 00:52:54.020]   in case you're unfamiliar.
[00:52:54.020 --> 00:52:56.580]   That means knowing your addition tables,
[00:52:56.580 --> 00:52:59.140]   your subtraction tables, your multiplication tables,
[00:52:59.140 --> 00:53:00.780]   and your division tables,
[00:53:00.780 --> 00:53:05.780]   knowing them cold as just flat out memorized,
[00:53:05.780 --> 00:53:08.340]   a memorized body of knowledge,
[00:53:08.340 --> 00:53:11.820]   is the most important thing you can do
[00:53:11.820 --> 00:53:13.420]   to establish a solid base
[00:53:13.420 --> 00:53:16.220]   under your children's later math success.
[00:53:16.220 --> 00:53:19.660]   If you have children who are past, I don't know,
[00:53:19.660 --> 00:53:22.140]   third grade, I think third grade age, whatever that is,
[00:53:22.140 --> 00:53:23.980]   fourth grade, whatever age that is,
[00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:25.580]   basically at that point in time,
[00:53:25.580 --> 00:53:29.380]   if your children do not have their math facts known
[00:53:29.380 --> 00:53:32.620]   cold, you wake 'em up, shake 'em in the middle of the night
[00:53:32.620 --> 00:53:34.340]   and say, "What's eight times six?"
[00:53:34.340 --> 00:53:36.100]   Or the hard ones, for me, the hard ones
[00:53:36.100 --> 00:53:38.660]   were always nine times seven or things like that.
[00:53:38.660 --> 00:53:40.500]   And if they can't just immediately spit out
[00:53:40.500 --> 00:53:41.700]   nine times seven is 63,
[00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:45.060]   then you need to do more drilling.
[00:53:45.060 --> 00:53:47.300]   So drill them and drill them and drill them
[00:53:47.300 --> 00:53:48.900]   and drill them and drill them and drill them
[00:53:48.900 --> 00:53:50.620]   and drill them and drill them and drill them
[00:53:50.620 --> 00:53:55.620]   until they are known absolutely cold.
[00:53:55.620 --> 00:53:58.340]   So if you're looking to invest in children
[00:53:58.340 --> 00:54:02.380]   and if you're looking to invest into your children's brains
[00:54:02.380 --> 00:54:04.820]   and to their mathematical abilities,
[00:54:04.820 --> 00:54:07.260]   it is your responsibility to make sure
[00:54:07.260 --> 00:54:11.380]   that they know their math facts absolutely cold.
[00:54:11.380 --> 00:54:16.380]   Go on Amazon, buy a set of math flashcards of math facts,
[00:54:16.380 --> 00:54:18.100]   at least up to the 12s,
[00:54:18.100 --> 00:54:21.660]   and drill them again and again and again
[00:54:21.660 --> 00:54:22.780]   on all the disciplines.
[00:54:22.780 --> 00:54:24.100]   Start, of course, with addition.
[00:54:24.100 --> 00:54:25.860]   And introduce it little by little.
[00:54:25.860 --> 00:54:27.500]   Just like a language,
[00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:29.140]   these need to be done little by little.
[00:54:29.140 --> 00:54:32.420]   You can start with your ones and your twos and your threes,
[00:54:32.420 --> 00:54:35.260]   but eventually every single one of them
[00:54:35.260 --> 00:54:36.840]   needs to be known cold.
[00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:39.860]   That's the most important thing to start with.
[00:54:39.860 --> 00:54:41.940]   Now, in looking at my own math career,
[00:54:41.940 --> 00:54:44.900]   the next thing that caused major problems
[00:54:44.900 --> 00:54:48.660]   was simply I didn't do enough work.
[00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:51.940]   I didn't repeat math enough times.
[00:54:51.940 --> 00:54:56.140]   In my high school, the curriculum that was used
[00:54:56.140 --> 00:54:59.900]   was Saxon math, which was fine.
[00:54:59.900 --> 00:55:01.860]   Many people think highly of Saxon math.
[00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:04.020]   Of course, it has many critics as well.
[00:55:04.020 --> 00:55:06.320]   I think highly of Saxon math.
[00:55:06.320 --> 00:55:09.380]   But what we didn't do was we didn't do all the problems.
[00:55:09.380 --> 00:55:10.980]   And we didn't do all the problems
[00:55:10.980 --> 00:55:14.020]   because we had to have class time explaining things.
[00:55:14.020 --> 00:55:16.220]   And what I now look back and realize clearly
[00:55:16.220 --> 00:55:20.140]   was that I almost never benefited from class explanations.
[00:55:20.140 --> 00:55:23.980]   In math, I needed to do problems.
[00:55:23.980 --> 00:55:25.900]   And if I needed an explanation,
[00:55:25.900 --> 00:55:27.700]   I needed an explanation of a problem
[00:55:27.700 --> 00:55:30.020]   that I got wrong until I did it.
[00:55:30.020 --> 00:55:31.940]   But I never felt confident.
[00:55:31.940 --> 00:55:34.740]   My entire high school and college,
[00:55:34.740 --> 00:55:37.620]   very limited college, very limited college math career,
[00:55:37.620 --> 00:55:41.140]   I never got confident with my ability in math
[00:55:41.140 --> 00:55:43.360]   because I never did enough practice.
[00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:44.280]   They would do things like,
[00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:46.740]   okay, you gotta go home and do the evens today,
[00:55:46.740 --> 00:55:47.580]   or the odds.
[00:55:47.580 --> 00:55:49.340]   We'd always be doing evens or odds.
[00:55:49.340 --> 00:55:51.300]   We always skipped half of the problems.
[00:55:51.300 --> 00:55:53.460]   And the reason the teacher, the math teacher,
[00:55:53.460 --> 00:55:56.180]   did that, of course, was quite simply
[00:55:56.180 --> 00:55:57.860]   that there wasn't enough time.
[00:55:57.860 --> 00:55:59.540]   There wasn't enough time to take a class
[00:55:59.540 --> 00:56:02.020]   of 20 or 25 or 30 students
[00:56:02.020 --> 00:56:07.020]   who were all at various abilities with mathematics,
[00:56:07.020 --> 00:56:10.260]   do a 10 to 20 minute lesson, et cetera,
[00:56:10.260 --> 00:56:12.900]   and then answer questions of people who don't understand
[00:56:12.900 --> 00:56:15.500]   and work those problems and give us enough time.
[00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:18.780]   And so when I look back at it,
[00:56:18.780 --> 00:56:21.340]   if my math class had simply consisted
[00:56:21.340 --> 00:56:24.780]   of my having a room to come into that was quiet
[00:56:24.780 --> 00:56:27.780]   and my being expected to read the lesson in the math book
[00:56:27.780 --> 00:56:29.340]   and work on it for an hour
[00:56:29.340 --> 00:56:31.900]   and then have a teacher or a tutor available to help me
[00:56:31.900 --> 00:56:33.820]   if there was something I didn't understand,
[00:56:33.820 --> 00:56:35.900]   that would have been far superior for me
[00:56:35.900 --> 00:56:37.940]   versus the normal classroom model
[00:56:37.940 --> 00:56:41.740]   where you have all the time dedicated to upfront teaching
[00:56:41.740 --> 00:56:45.140]   and then you don't have enough time to do the homework.
[00:56:45.140 --> 00:56:49.500]   And so the speed at which a math student proceeds through
[00:56:49.500 --> 00:56:53.140]   needs to be slow enough that the student can develop
[00:56:53.140 --> 00:56:58.020]   and demonstrate mastery over the material.
[00:56:58.020 --> 00:57:00.040]   And so I can see very clearly
[00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:02.940]   about how important it would have been for me
[00:57:02.940 --> 00:57:04.980]   and was for me to be consistent
[00:57:04.980 --> 00:57:07.020]   and to work lots and lots of problems.
[00:57:07.020 --> 00:57:10.820]   Working math problems when you know the material,
[00:57:10.820 --> 00:57:15.120]   at least for me, I don't have any way to say
[00:57:15.120 --> 00:57:17.300]   for most people, so I'm projecting,
[00:57:17.300 --> 00:57:19.220]   but for me is very satisfying.
[00:57:19.220 --> 00:57:22.500]   Doing math that you know how to do is very satisfying.
[00:57:22.500 --> 00:57:25.660]   It's not boring.
[00:57:25.660 --> 00:57:27.180]   The math that we don't like to do
[00:57:27.180 --> 00:57:29.220]   is when we don't know how to do it.
[00:57:29.220 --> 00:57:32.580]   And so I don't know if that's a universal experience,
[00:57:32.580 --> 00:57:34.900]   but I think it's probably fairly common
[00:57:34.900 --> 00:57:37.060]   that if you are coaching your child
[00:57:37.060 --> 00:57:40.220]   and your child is not skilled with math,
[00:57:40.220 --> 00:57:42.580]   is not succeeding with math,
[00:57:42.580 --> 00:57:45.760]   it's probably because your child is not mastering math.
[00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:49.120]   And then what happens is you get into this vicious cycle.
[00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:50.840]   Child doesn't understand.
[00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:51.840]   Child doesn't understand
[00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:56.200]   because he's not done enough problems to understand it,
[00:57:56.200 --> 00:57:59.200]   how to do it just instinctively.
[00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:02.120]   Because he doesn't understand, the problems are painful.
[00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:03.520]   And then because he doesn't wanna do it,
[00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:04.480]   he doesn't do enough problems,
[00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:05.880]   and you get into this downward cycle
[00:58:05.880 --> 00:58:09.600]   where you're just not doing enough of the actual effort.
[00:58:09.600 --> 00:58:10.800]   Think of it like this.
[00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:15.360]   Let's use a weightlifting, or let's use a running analogy.
[00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:17.220]   If you wanted to be an accomplished runner,
[00:58:17.220 --> 00:58:19.520]   you don't become an accomplished runner
[00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:23.380]   by once a month going out for a really long run.
[00:58:23.380 --> 00:58:25.300]   You become an accomplished runner
[00:58:25.300 --> 00:58:28.660]   by doing lots and lots of systematic runs
[00:58:28.660 --> 00:58:30.840]   that are well within your ability
[00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:35.620]   to build the overall muscular strength and stability
[00:58:35.620 --> 00:58:38.100]   and stamina, et cetera, and lung strength, et cetera.
[00:58:38.100 --> 00:58:42.480]   And then you then challenge yourself on occasion,
[00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:44.520]   or excuse me, instead of saying on occasion,
[00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:46.840]   I say you challenge yourself regularly.
[00:58:46.840 --> 00:58:49.380]   So a runner works diligently
[00:58:49.380 --> 00:58:52.160]   to build up a solid base under his running,
[00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:54.800]   and then he challenges himself with a long run
[00:58:54.800 --> 00:58:57.040]   or a fast run, et cetera.
[00:58:57.040 --> 00:59:00.120]   Mathematics should be done on the same principle.
[00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:02.760]   There should be lots and lots of consistent
[00:59:02.760 --> 00:59:04.000]   putting in the miles,
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:06.040]   putting in the problems of things that you know,
[00:59:06.040 --> 00:59:07.720]   and then there should be challenges
[00:59:07.720 --> 00:59:10.020]   where you learn a new concept, it's really challenging,
[00:59:10.020 --> 00:59:11.760]   then you do it, do it, do it, do it, do it,
[00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:12.800]   and then it becomes old hat,
[00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:14.880]   and then you challenge it, et cetera.
[00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:18.220]   And that leads to confidence with mathematics.
[00:59:18.220 --> 00:59:20.840]   And so we don't give students generally
[00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:23.160]   enough time to do problems.
[00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:24.840]   And I understand why.
[00:59:24.840 --> 00:59:27.360]   The teacher, how can, if the teacher enforces
[00:59:27.360 --> 00:59:29.160]   too many problems, she's gonna complain,
[00:59:29.160 --> 00:59:32.920]   but that's the key to doing very, very well.
[00:59:32.920 --> 00:59:36.640]   Math mastery comes from doing the work
[00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:39.920]   versus just somehow magically understanding it.
[00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:43.200]   Now, this is not, these opinions are not without controversy,
[00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:45.480]   but I've read and listened to a lot of people,
[00:59:45.480 --> 00:59:48.760]   and I'm reflecting my own insight
[00:59:48.760 --> 00:59:51.520]   as a self-aware student who struggled with math,
[00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:53.720]   who got better, but who never got as good
[00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:55.740]   as he could have become.
[00:59:55.740 --> 00:59:57.960]   So what's necessary is consistency
[00:59:57.960 --> 01:00:00.360]   and working lots of problems.
[01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:02.520]   Now, to your child's abilities,
[01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:04.920]   if you want to help your child succeed,
[01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:07.300]   whether your child is in a homeschool environment
[01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:09.480]   or in a traditional school environment,
[01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:12.720]   one of the best things you can do with his math abilities
[01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:15.900]   is to require consistent work from him
[01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:20.040]   so that he doesn't go into the summertime slump.
[01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:21.800]   One of the worst things about the way
[01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:24.840]   at least the American educational calendar is set up
[01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:26.980]   is that you have a school year
[01:00:26.980 --> 01:00:29.120]   with a huge long summer break.
[01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:31.620]   And what results is that students think
[01:00:31.620 --> 01:00:33.920]   that they should only do work five days a week
[01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:35.880]   for the 180 days of school.
[01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:39.360]   And then the last couple of weeks are wasted, generally.
[01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:41.920]   You have wasted weeks of test prep,
[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:43.560]   and then the first few weeks are wasted
[01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:45.920]   trying to catch the child back up.
[01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:48.160]   And if math is like a language,
[01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:51.840]   it's more important to have daily consistency
[01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:56.280]   than it is to have massive levels of work
[01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:57.460]   on an ongoing basis.
[01:00:57.460 --> 01:00:59.300]   Meaning if you could only do,
[01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:03.040]   if you could only, if you try to study a language
[01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:06.960]   for a three-hour stretch, and then you wait a week,
[01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:09.720]   you would be better off with just 20 minutes every day
[01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:11.680]   or 30 minutes every day,
[01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:14.240]   even if your total time invested is less
[01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:16.280]   because of the value of consistency.
[01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:21.280]   And I think math has the same basic focus and need.
[01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:24.080]   And so I think that if you want your child
[01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:25.460]   to develop his brain,
[01:01:25.460 --> 01:01:28.480]   regardless of the school environment,
[01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:31.960]   you should require as much math
[01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:34.660]   as can be practically exercised.
[01:01:34.660 --> 01:01:38.240]   And here, I think a good inspirational example
[01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:40.600]   would be that of Art Robinson
[01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:43.280]   and what he did with his children.
[01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:44.720]   You can read about his story
[01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:48.440]   at a website called robinsoncurriculum.com.
[01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:51.080]   But the short version of it is that Art Robinson
[01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:53.880]   was a, is a scientist,
[01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:56.300]   and he and his wife were both research scientists
[01:01:56.300 --> 01:01:57.140]   working together.
[01:01:57.140 --> 01:01:59.440]   His wife, Lori, they had six children,
[01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:01.560]   and they were committed to homeschooling.
[01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:05.040]   And then Lori died, developed this illness
[01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:07.400]   that killed her in something like 24, 48 hours.
[01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:11.000]   And he was left as a father of six children,
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.440]   including one baby, with no wife,
[01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:16.600]   who was desirous and committed to homeschooling
[01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:19.040]   while also needing to work.
[01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:24.040]   And basically, he applied a very simple system
[01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:27.820]   to his own family,
[01:02:27.820 --> 01:02:31.340]   and he required his children to learn math facts.
[01:02:31.340 --> 01:02:35.460]   Then he wound up accidentally creating a system
[01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:39.020]   of self-education for mathematics.
[01:02:39.020 --> 01:02:40.900]   What he would do is he would require his children
[01:02:40.900 --> 01:02:41.900]   to learn math facts.
[01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:44.380]   Once they had mastered their math facts,
[01:02:44.380 --> 01:02:48.080]   then he handed them a Saxon 5-4 book,
[01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:50.300]   which is basically the fifth grade book,
[01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:51.340]   and they started,
[01:02:51.340 --> 01:02:54.340]   and they would just work their way through the problems.
[01:02:54.340 --> 01:02:58.320]   And what they did was they did math six days a week,
[01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:00.580]   usually about one to two hours a day,
[01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:02.820]   and the students were required
[01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:04.380]   to teach themselves the lesson
[01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:06.820]   and just proceed through the problems.
[01:03:06.820 --> 01:03:08.340]   And if it was going too long,
[01:03:08.340 --> 01:03:09.340]   they would lower the problem.
[01:03:09.340 --> 01:03:10.420]   Normally, they would do,
[01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:13.420]   a Saxon lesson usually has 30 problems on a daily basis,
[01:03:13.420 --> 01:03:16.060]   so a 30-problem set would take about an hour to two,
[01:03:16.060 --> 01:03:17.080]   one to two hours.
[01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:18.660]   If they were going to,
[01:03:18.660 --> 01:03:21.700]   if it was too hard for them,
[01:03:21.700 --> 01:03:23.140]   they would drop it to 15 problems.
[01:03:23.140 --> 01:03:24.100]   If it was too easy for them,
[01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:26.820]   they'd increase it to 45 or 60 problems.
[01:03:26.820 --> 01:03:31.100]   But the outcome of this approach
[01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:33.740]   led to quite impressive,
[01:03:33.740 --> 01:03:38.660]   quite impressive educational results
[01:03:38.660 --> 01:03:40.020]   and educational outcomes.
[01:03:40.020 --> 01:03:42.660]   He developed a homeschool system
[01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:45.100]   that created,
[01:03:45.100 --> 01:03:46.580]   that focused on the basics,
[01:03:46.580 --> 01:03:48.460]   reading, writing, and arithmetic.
[01:03:48.460 --> 01:03:50.000]   In essence, he required his students
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.180]   to do two hours of math a day,
[01:03:52.180 --> 01:03:54.980]   to read off of an assigned book list for two hours a day,
[01:03:54.980 --> 01:03:56.940]   and then to write a page a day for an essay,
[01:03:56.940 --> 01:04:00.280]   which wound up basically being an hour a day.
[01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:01.340]   Following this model,
[01:04:01.340 --> 01:04:02.980]   his children all completed calculus
[01:04:02.980 --> 01:04:05.940]   at around 14 or 15 years old.
[01:04:05.940 --> 01:04:07.340]   Following the study of calculus,
[01:04:07.340 --> 01:04:10.060]   they went on and studied physics and chemistry.
[01:04:10.060 --> 01:04:12.620]   They all passed AP calculus exams, et cetera.
[01:04:12.620 --> 01:04:14.200]   And today, of his six children,
[01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:16.340]   it may be all six of them now have PhDs,
[01:04:16.340 --> 01:04:18.420]   but four or five of them do.
[01:04:18.420 --> 01:04:20.380]   And you can read more about his story.
[01:04:20.380 --> 01:04:23.620]   You can find some old lectures of him lecturing
[01:04:23.620 --> 01:04:26.340]   on his homeschooling approach.
[01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:27.260]   Very inspirational.
[01:04:27.260 --> 01:04:28.620]   In fact, maybe I'll pull in the audio
[01:04:28.620 --> 01:04:29.980]   from some of his old lectures
[01:04:29.980 --> 01:04:32.100]   and release it to you here in the feed.
[01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:35.860]   But very, very inspirational in terms of his story.
[01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:38.940]   And I first read that story before I ever had children,
[01:04:38.940 --> 01:04:41.020]   and I have planned since then
[01:04:41.020 --> 01:04:42.260]   to do this with my own children,
[01:04:42.260 --> 01:04:44.700]   and I'm in the process now of doing it,
[01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:46.380]   a couple of modifications.
[01:04:46.380 --> 01:04:49.060]   At its core, I wanna emphasize
[01:04:49.060 --> 01:04:52.820]   that the key is to do math every day.
[01:04:52.820 --> 01:04:56.060]   And one point that Robinson uses,
[01:04:56.060 --> 01:04:57.580]   or used, always used,
[01:04:57.580 --> 01:05:01.380]   is that he always required his children to start with math.
[01:05:01.380 --> 01:05:04.580]   And his theory on that was you need to,
[01:05:04.580 --> 01:05:08.580]   because math is hard, children need to be trained
[01:05:08.580 --> 01:05:11.200]   that the first thing you do when you wake up in the morning
[01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:13.120]   is you do something hard.
[01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:15.700]   And I am convinced of the value of this.
[01:05:15.700 --> 01:05:17.460]   So this is what we do in our homeschool.
[01:05:17.460 --> 01:05:18.860]   We get up in the morning.
[01:05:18.860 --> 01:05:20.980]   As soon as we start, we start with math,
[01:05:20.980 --> 01:05:22.100]   and we start with a hard thing,
[01:05:22.100 --> 01:05:23.940]   and we stay at it until we're done.
[01:05:23.940 --> 01:05:28.120]   Because at its core, this success skill
[01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:29.860]   is something that needs to be developed,
[01:05:29.860 --> 01:05:32.980]   and we can use math to develop it in our children.
[01:05:32.980 --> 01:05:34.260]   I don't wanna start my morning
[01:05:34.260 --> 01:05:35.860]   with something that's pleasurable
[01:05:35.860 --> 01:05:38.460]   or trying to figure out what do I really wanna do first.
[01:05:38.460 --> 01:05:41.120]   I wanna start with the hardest thing on my list.
[01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:43.140]   Brian Tracy would call this eat that frog,
[01:05:43.140 --> 01:05:44.700]   coming from the old saying,
[01:05:44.700 --> 01:05:46.300]   maybe attributed to Mark Twain,
[01:05:46.300 --> 01:05:48.540]   that if you've gotta eat a frog every day,
[01:05:48.540 --> 01:05:49.900]   you know that's gonna be the worst thing
[01:05:49.900 --> 01:05:51.100]   that's gonna happen to you.
[01:05:51.100 --> 01:05:53.400]   If you know that you need to eat a frog,
[01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:54.340]   that's probably the worst thing
[01:05:54.340 --> 01:05:55.880]   that's gonna happen in a day,
[01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:58.300]   so you might as well get up and face it and eat the frog,
[01:05:58.300 --> 01:06:00.940]   and then you know everything's better from there.
[01:06:00.940 --> 01:06:02.740]   So basically the same principle.
[01:06:02.740 --> 01:06:05.140]   And so with children, as I see it,
[01:06:05.140 --> 01:06:08.420]   this should be a fundamental tool that we use,
[01:06:08.420 --> 01:06:10.060]   is we want our children to be smarter,
[01:06:10.060 --> 01:06:11.900]   we want them to gain all of the benefits
[01:06:11.900 --> 01:06:15.580]   of a rigorous mathematical occasion, education, excuse me.
[01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:17.620]   We want them to gain strict thinking skills,
[01:06:17.620 --> 01:06:19.700]   we wanna understand the world very clearly,
[01:06:19.700 --> 01:06:22.220]   we want them to have true and fundamental knowledge,
[01:06:22.220 --> 01:06:24.020]   not appreciation,
[01:06:24.020 --> 01:06:26.660]   and we want them to be trained to do something hard,
[01:06:26.660 --> 01:06:29.860]   and to do it first thing every single day.
[01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:33.960]   And so mathematics to me seems the ideal way to do it.
[01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:37.380]   The next point though,
[01:06:37.380 --> 01:06:41.220]   is that the pace of math progression
[01:06:41.220 --> 01:06:46.220]   should be tailored individually to the child.
[01:06:46.380 --> 01:06:48.220]   Math, because it is something
[01:06:48.220 --> 01:06:51.900]   that involves cumulative knowledge and skills,
[01:06:51.900 --> 01:06:54.020]   we don't just try to push the child forward
[01:06:54.020 --> 01:06:55.820]   or pull the child back.
[01:06:55.820 --> 01:06:59.120]   If the child is struggling with something, we slow down.
[01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:00.300]   We master the concept
[01:07:00.300 --> 01:07:01.960]   until the child is no longer struggling,
[01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:03.700]   and then we press on.
[01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:08.220]   Now I'm fairly young in my own tutoring of this
[01:07:08.220 --> 01:07:10.180]   with my children,
[01:07:10.180 --> 01:07:13.300]   but I have observed this,
[01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:18.300]   and the importance of proceeding at the rate of the student
[01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:20.260]   when teaching long division
[01:07:20.260 --> 01:07:24.140]   and practicing long division to my eldest child.
[01:07:24.140 --> 01:07:25.680]   Long division is of course a skill
[01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:28.220]   that probably for most of us was intimidating at first.
[01:07:28.220 --> 01:07:31.180]   It can be difficult, it takes time to develop.
[01:07:31.180 --> 01:07:32.740]   And I was tutoring and working,
[01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:35.860]   I wasn't requiring an entirely self-taught system
[01:07:35.860 --> 01:07:36.820]   at that time,
[01:07:36.820 --> 01:07:38.980]   but I was tutoring with my student
[01:07:38.980 --> 01:07:40.840]   and working with him, et cetera.
[01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:43.880]   And I realized that it doesn't matter
[01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:47.000]   how many problems I help him with.
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.920]   What matters is that I help him
[01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:51.600]   until he's able to do it himself,
[01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:54.900]   and that he does it himself then until he is confident.
[01:07:54.900 --> 01:07:58.320]   I was tempted early in the experience
[01:07:58.320 --> 01:08:00.000]   to say, "Well, I'm just gonna help you with a few things,
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:01.520]   "then you gotta figure it out."
[01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:03.400]   But I realized my student is quite young,
[01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:06.440]   not at the age yet where I'm willing to be so hardcore.
[01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:09.280]   And I realized it doesn't matter
[01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:12.000]   whether a student needs 10 problems
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.560]   of me working them with you,
[01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:15.660]   or 110 problems.
[01:08:15.660 --> 01:08:18.480]   What matters is that you see the examples
[01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:20.000]   and you work the examples
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.760]   and you're helped with it until you master it.
[01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:25.340]   And then that you have enough practice examples
[01:08:25.340 --> 01:08:26.520]   to master it.
[01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:27.920]   And that's the principle that I think
[01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:29.400]   we should all apply with our children,
[01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:31.540]   regardless of who their teacher is,
[01:08:31.540 --> 01:08:35.760]   regardless of the curriculum, et cetera.
[01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:37.960]   Help as much as is necessary
[01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:40.880]   until the child's brain grasps it,
[01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:43.840]   and then require mastery of the concept.
[01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:48.200]   I do believe that requiring the child's brain
[01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:51.440]   to figure it out is a tool
[01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:54.680]   that we should consistently use.
[01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:56.880]   Back to the book, "Equation for Excellence,"
[01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:59.120]   chapter four, "Incentive and Struggle,
[01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:02.240]   "The Art of Developing the Mind."
[01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:04.080]   When taught right, math builds the mind
[01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:06.160]   in the way that lifting weights builds the muscles.
[01:09:06.160 --> 01:09:09.080]   But not all methods of teaching math do this equally.
[01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:11.360]   In fact, some of the more recently adopted methods
[01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:13.720]   of teaching math actually do the reverse.
[01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:16.840]   Not only do these methods fail to build cognitive skills,
[01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:19.360]   but they actually cause skills
[01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:23.060]   that the student has already built to atrophy.
[01:09:23.060 --> 01:09:26.380]   Three things cause cognitive skills to develop.
[01:09:26.380 --> 01:09:28.140]   The first is age.
[01:09:28.140 --> 01:09:30.160]   Even with the worst education available,
[01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:32.420]   human biology will make a 16-year-old
[01:09:32.420 --> 01:09:34.760]   more intelligent than a two-year-old.
[01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:37.720]   The second thing that causes cognitive skills to develop
[01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:39.560]   is exposure.
[01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:42.060]   Children who are exposed to interesting ideas
[01:09:42.060 --> 01:09:44.600]   and problem types can freely stretch their minds
[01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:46.840]   and explore new modes of thought.
[01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:49.680]   As a simple example, a child who plays with a Rubik's cube
[01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:53.320]   may develop a surer sense of three-dimensional reasoning.
[01:09:53.320 --> 01:09:56.180]   The third consideration is incentive.
[01:09:56.180 --> 01:09:57.920]   A child who plays with a Rubik's cube
[01:09:57.920 --> 01:10:01.240]   may develop the foundation for strong spatial reasoning.
[01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:02.880]   However, without a strong incentive,
[01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:05.280]   he may never push his mind to the limit.
[01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:07.920]   If he cannot figure out how to solve the Rubik's cube,
[01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:09.880]   he will probably just give up.
[01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:12.080]   For the mind to have the incentive to develop,
[01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:13.880]   two things are necessary.
[01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:18.880]   First, it must encounter a problem that it is unable to do.
[01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:24.320]   The process of figuring out how to solve
[01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:27.620]   this initially unsolvable problem
[01:10:27.620 --> 01:10:30.240]   causes the mind to develop.
[01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:32.720]   If a student is only given problems
[01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:34.640]   at his current ability level,
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:37.800]   what incentive does the mind have to improve?
[01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:40.000]   Just as lifting a half-pound weight
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.540]   will not make a person physically stronger,
[01:10:42.540 --> 01:10:44.280]   doing an easy math problem
[01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:47.400]   will not make a person mentally stronger.
[01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:50.160]   Parents and teachers of gifted students often overlook this
[01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:52.700]   and just allow them to work at a comfortable pace.
[01:10:52.700 --> 01:10:54.520]   The result is that the gifted students
[01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:57.600]   never get the opportunity to realize their full potential.
[01:10:57.600 --> 01:10:59.880]   Like natural athletes who never train hard,
[01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:02.840]   they end up squandering their innate talents.
[01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:04.760]   No matter how smart a student is,
[01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:07.480]   he must be given some challenging math problems
[01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:10.120]   that he is initially unable to do.
[01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:11.800]   If he can solve the problem in five minutes,
[01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:13.920]   it is not a real challenging problem.
[01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:15.600]   An appropriate challenging problem
[01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:19.520]   should take anywhere from 20 minutes to a week to solve.
[01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:23.360]   Once you have a sufficiently challenging problem,
[01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:26.300]   the next thing you need is incentive.
[01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:27.640]   If the student has no incentive
[01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:29.160]   to figure out a difficult problem,
[01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:30.920]   he will simply walk away.
[01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:33.840]   However, by understanding what motivates your child,
[01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:37.600]   you can design the right kinds of incentives.
[01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:40.880]   So we will pause there, but the key is
[01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:45.780]   we want the child's brain to struggle with something hard
[01:11:45.780 --> 01:11:47.720]   in order for it to grow,
[01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:51.180]   just like we want the child to struggle
[01:11:51.180 --> 01:11:55.620]   while lifting a heavy weight so that his muscles may grow.
[01:11:55.620 --> 01:11:58.980]   When you're looking at math curricula,
[01:11:58.980 --> 01:12:01.420]   you may just have one that's exposed to you
[01:12:01.420 --> 01:12:03.860]   with your school.
[01:12:03.860 --> 01:12:05.440]   There are a couple of philosophies
[01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:09.160]   into which most math curricula are segmented.
[01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:11.640]   One is what is called mastery,
[01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:14.440]   and the other is what is called spiral.
[01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:16.460]   I don't like the word mastery in a name,
[01:12:16.460 --> 01:12:17.720]   but let me explain what it means.
[01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:20.760]   Basically, the concept is we're going to introduce a concept
[01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:22.360]   and we're gonna drill it and drill it and drill it
[01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:23.840]   and drill only that concept
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:26.000]   until the student masters that concept.
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:27.580]   Then we're gonna go on to something else
[01:12:27.580 --> 01:12:28.920]   and we're gonna drill it, drill it, drill it
[01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:31.320]   until the student masters that concept.
[01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:32.880]   That's contrasted with,
[01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:34.080]   and then we're gonna go on to something else.
[01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:38.960]   So the concepts are given as a block
[01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:40.180]   and you go through them.
[01:12:40.180 --> 01:12:42.320]   That's contrasted with what is often called
[01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:43.500]   the spiral approach.
[01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:46.480]   The spiral approach is we're gonna introduce a new concept,
[01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:48.240]   you're gonna do some practice problems,
[01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:50.640]   and then the next day you're gonna do a couple of problems,
[01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:53.080]   but it's gonna be intermixed with everything else.
[01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:54.760]   And we're gonna just spiral around
[01:12:54.760 --> 01:12:55.960]   going up and up and up and up,
[01:12:55.960 --> 01:12:58.280]   and you're gonna master the concept over time
[01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:01.240]   because you're doing it a little bit every day.
[01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:05.380]   I've read enough parents' results to recognize
[01:13:05.380 --> 01:13:07.800]   that probably both can be fine.
[01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:09.320]   It seems like people will go through
[01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:11.760]   different math curricula searching for something
[01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:13.480]   that works for them.
[01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:15.400]   And of course, finding something that works for you
[01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:17.320]   is the key.
[01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:22.320]   I'm no expert on that field.
[01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:29.600]   Right now, we are using the ABECA math curriculum
[01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:32.480]   and what I like about it,
[01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:34.880]   it's actually for one specific reason.
[01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:36.960]   First, it is a spiral methodology.
[01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:39.800]   I'm more attracted to the concept of the spiral methodology
[01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:43.400]   'cause it fits with my concept of math as a language.
[01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:45.640]   Introduce something new, learn it, drill it, use it,
[01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:46.960]   and don't stop using it.
[01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:49.920]   Just continually build, build, build little by little.
[01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:51.480]   So I find that attractive,
[01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:53.080]   but I would be open to other things.
[01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:55.440]   I just have never needed to try anything else.
[01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:56.840]   What I specifically like,
[01:13:56.840 --> 01:13:59.120]   the reason we're not using Saxon math,
[01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:00.440]   which I appreciate,
[01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:05.440]   is that Saxon math being a non-consumable textbook
[01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:11.240]   requires the math student to write a significant amount
[01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:13.920]   'cause all the problems have to be copied out on paper.
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:18.720]   And the specific hangup that I faced with my eldest
[01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:21.380]   is a lack of desire to write.
[01:14:21.380 --> 01:14:24.040]   Many young boys are allergic to pencils
[01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:25.280]   and we have that disease.
[01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:27.840]   Now we make progress in it, good progress over time,
[01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:31.240]   but the Abeka math is a very discrete,
[01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:32.840]   and I mean that in the mathematical concept,
[01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:35.880]   meaning confined, limited, a very discrete thing.
[01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:37.480]   There's a page front and back,
[01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:39.000]   and once you're done with the page, you're done.
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:40.880]   And yet that page seems to fit well,
[01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:42.480]   and it doesn't require a lot of writing
[01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:44.080]   because the work is done on the page.
[01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:45.960]   So that's been a winner for us.
[01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:48.720]   I'm impressed with the arithmetic curriculum of the Abeka.
[01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:51.440]   I don't intend to continue at past arithmetic,
[01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:53.160]   but time will tell.
[01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:56.460]   You go and choose something that you like.
[01:14:56.460 --> 01:14:58.520]   I do think there is value
[01:14:58.520 --> 01:15:02.220]   in learning concepts of mathematics.
[01:15:02.220 --> 01:15:06.660]   And so I have also supplemented the Abeka curriculum
[01:15:06.660 --> 01:15:09.640]   with something called Life of Fred.
[01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:13.480]   I stumbled into Life of Fred in a very organic manner.
[01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:15.960]   I was actually looking for a high school level
[01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:17.200]   personal finance curriculum.
[01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:19.040]   I was researching the market on personal finance,
[01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:20.840]   trying to understand what was out there.
[01:15:20.840 --> 01:15:25.240]   And I stumbled across the Life of Fred personal finance book.
[01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:27.440]   And I was browsing the table of contents
[01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:28.840]   and the sample book,
[01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:31.800]   and I was amazed at the quality of the book
[01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:33.720]   as a personal finance curriculum.
[01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:35.820]   I thought to myself, like, this guy's teaching concepts
[01:15:35.820 --> 01:15:37.800]   that I'm the only one I know who teaches this stuff,
[01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:39.040]   and this is great.
[01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:40.560]   So I immediately went and started looking
[01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:43.360]   at the rest of his math curriculum.
[01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:45.720]   And Life of Fred, the author Stanley Schmidt,
[01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:47.000]   something like that,
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:50.100]   has developed a complete math curriculum
[01:15:50.100 --> 01:15:52.320]   that takes a student through
[01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:55.280]   from the very basics of arithmetic
[01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:58.520]   through and past college level calculus
[01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:00.280]   to some of the advanced higher linear,
[01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:02.440]   I think he has a linear algebra book.
[01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:05.040]   He might have a differential equation book, I'm not sure.
[01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:08.000]   And he does it all in a literary format
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:12.120]   where he uses this goofy character
[01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:16.580]   that kids seem to love, this goofy character.
[01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:20.380]   And basically this goofy character
[01:16:20.380 --> 01:16:22.340]   has these various adventures,
[01:16:22.340 --> 01:16:24.980]   and the various adventures and goofy stories
[01:16:24.980 --> 01:16:28.700]   that he goes through require him to develop
[01:16:28.700 --> 01:16:30.680]   and exercise math skills.
[01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:33.900]   So it shows the application of the math skills.
[01:16:33.900 --> 01:16:37.620]   And he's an experienced math teacher,
[01:16:37.620 --> 01:16:40.420]   and my children have loved reading the books.
[01:16:40.420 --> 01:16:43.800]   He's very strong on the idea that his math curriculum
[01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:46.260]   is the only thing that somebody needs.
[01:16:46.260 --> 01:16:47.920]   I'm sure it's maybe so,
[01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:52.920]   but I like seeing the output of the Beka,
[01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:54.820]   and so we're doing both of them.
[01:16:54.820 --> 01:16:57.660]   But I really love that, and the children really enjoy it.
[01:16:57.660 --> 01:16:59.660]   And I like it because it deals with math
[01:16:59.660 --> 01:17:01.300]   from an understanding level
[01:17:01.300 --> 01:17:05.200]   and in a story way to see the application.
[01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:07.620]   And he weaves in all these incredible
[01:17:07.620 --> 01:17:10.100]   little extra tidbits of knowledge and fact
[01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:12.260]   into his stories, really, really remarkable.
[01:17:12.260 --> 01:17:14.580]   So we've become big fans of Life of Fred.
[01:17:14.580 --> 01:17:16.020]   It's not our exclusive curriculum,
[01:17:16.020 --> 01:17:17.180]   but we've become big fans of that.
[01:17:17.180 --> 01:17:20.020]   And that can be something I think that you may enjoy.
[01:17:20.020 --> 01:17:22.100]   So I think that math, what can help with math
[01:17:22.100 --> 01:17:25.300]   is learning the concepts, gaining tutoring, et cetera.
[01:17:25.300 --> 01:17:29.700]   A narrative approach can help to supplement
[01:17:29.700 --> 01:17:31.900]   the drill and kill approach.
[01:17:31.900 --> 01:17:35.060]   Doing math consistently, daily,
[01:17:35.060 --> 01:17:38.900]   consistently with shorter breaks, it's fine.
[01:17:38.900 --> 01:17:41.840]   I think if your student needs a few weeks off, fine.
[01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:43.620]   But I struggle with the idea that students
[01:17:43.620 --> 01:17:47.460]   somehow need four months off a year.
[01:17:47.460 --> 01:17:49.460]   Doesn't make any sense to me that a student
[01:17:49.460 --> 01:17:51.740]   would need four months off at a time.
[01:17:51.740 --> 01:17:53.740]   It does make sense to me that a break,
[01:17:53.740 --> 01:17:55.540]   a vacation, is appropriate.
[01:17:55.540 --> 01:17:58.700]   So I look at it and say, if I go on vacation, fine.
[01:17:58.700 --> 01:17:59.800]   We'll take the family on vacation.
[01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:01.620]   That's a good time to have a vacation from school.
[01:18:01.620 --> 01:18:03.820]   But the idea that you need four months off
[01:18:03.820 --> 01:18:07.620]   from any kind of schooling seems to me a little bit silly.
[01:18:07.620 --> 01:18:09.720]   And so I think that students should
[01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:11.440]   at least do math all summer.
[01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:14.760]   Even if they just do math and free reading
[01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:16.920]   or limited reading.
[01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:18.760]   Again, a vacation is fine, but it doesn't need
[01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:20.080]   to be a vacation from thinking.
[01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:22.300]   We should never have a vacation from thinking.
[01:18:22.300 --> 01:18:23.920]   And then lots of consistent work
[01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:25.580]   and challenging self-teaching, et cetera,
[01:18:25.580 --> 01:18:29.260]   should help a child to be very skilled with mathematics.
[01:18:29.260 --> 01:18:32.200]   Now I want to, I'm not concluding the episode.
[01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:34.600]   There's gonna be quite a lot of time after this point.
[01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:36.680]   But the last concept I wanna focus on,
[01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:39.300]   or the last topic I wanna address with you,
[01:18:39.300 --> 01:18:42.520]   is at what age should we start teaching math and how?
[01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:45.660]   Because this is important.
[01:18:45.660 --> 01:18:50.660]   And I arrived at my current opinion somewhat on my own.
[01:18:50.660 --> 01:18:58.020]   And then I have since found people that agree with me,
[01:18:58.020 --> 01:19:00.620]   which helps me to feel increasingly confident.
[01:19:00.620 --> 01:19:02.660]   But my comment is basically
[01:19:02.660 --> 01:19:06.240]   that formal study of mathematics,
[01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:08.180]   I'm not sure that early is better.
[01:19:08.180 --> 01:19:09.480]   Now, I'll tell you the story
[01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:10.860]   of how I arrived at this conclusion.
[01:19:10.860 --> 01:19:12.860]   First, I have a brother
[01:19:12.860 --> 01:19:17.000]   who has a bachelor's degree in mathematics.
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:20.980]   And his observation and experience of learning mathematics
[01:19:20.980 --> 01:19:25.560]   and teaching mathematics is that a whole lot of time
[01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:28.980]   is wasted trying to teach math to the young.
[01:19:28.980 --> 01:19:33.180]   And that why do we spend a month teaching a concept
[01:19:33.180 --> 01:19:35.780]   and drilling a concept for a very young child,
[01:19:35.780 --> 01:19:37.540]   when if we just waited a few years,
[01:19:37.540 --> 01:19:40.240]   the child could grasp that same concept in a day.
[01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:44.580]   And I have often wondered if he was right.
[01:19:44.580 --> 01:19:47.840]   Now, I'm persuaded, I was always persuaded of the idea
[01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:50.500]   that we should teach children things at a very young age.
[01:19:50.500 --> 01:19:51.900]   But I heard him say that,
[01:19:51.900 --> 01:19:54.540]   and I filed that away and paid attention to it.
[01:19:54.540 --> 01:19:57.700]   Secondly, I've come across various math teachers
[01:19:57.700 --> 01:19:58.980]   who talk about the right age
[01:19:58.980 --> 01:20:01.260]   to start learning something like algebra.
[01:20:01.260 --> 01:20:04.860]   And one math teacher who runs a curriculum that I like,
[01:20:04.860 --> 01:20:07.180]   and will probably use in high school,
[01:20:07.180 --> 01:20:09.060]   he had this comment, he said,
[01:20:09.060 --> 01:20:11.100]   "Children shouldn't study algebra
[01:20:11.100 --> 01:20:13.300]   until they have hair in their armpits."
[01:20:13.300 --> 01:20:16.120]   Basic idea being, your brain needs a certain degree
[01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:21.120]   of physical maturity before it can completely and fully
[01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:26.020]   is ready for abstract concepts like algebra.
[01:20:26.020 --> 01:20:29.060]   So don't try to teach algebra to your child prodigy
[01:20:29.060 --> 01:20:30.460]   and just push, push, push.
[01:20:30.460 --> 01:20:33.980]   Just wait until the child is emotionally mature
[01:20:33.980 --> 01:20:35.720]   and it'll be easy.
[01:20:35.720 --> 01:20:38.940]   And I developed, based on these ideas
[01:20:38.940 --> 01:20:42.180]   and hearing various math teachers say things like this,
[01:20:42.180 --> 01:20:46.140]   this is why I developed the personal philosophy
[01:20:46.140 --> 01:20:50.300]   that our primary focus in the early years should be language
[01:20:50.300 --> 01:20:53.140]   because there are disadvantages to many subjects
[01:20:53.140 --> 01:20:54.180]   that are taught in school,
[01:20:54.180 --> 01:20:55.980]   teaching them at too young of an age.
[01:20:55.980 --> 01:20:57.540]   If the math teachers are correct
[01:20:57.540 --> 01:21:01.020]   and a student needs a certain ability with abstract thinking
[01:21:01.020 --> 01:21:03.940]   that comes with the maturity of the brain,
[01:21:03.940 --> 01:21:06.040]   then our goal is not to get our seven-year-old
[01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:07.720]   doing algebra.
[01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:09.960]   And similarly, if we look at science, right?
[01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:12.960]   I think it's crazy why we spend all kinds of times
[01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:16.360]   on kinds of time on science education, quote unquote,
[01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:17.500]   for very young children.
[01:21:17.500 --> 01:21:20.280]   I'm personally persuaded that science education
[01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:21.680]   should follow math education.
[01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:24.700]   Robinson makes this point very heavily.
[01:21:24.700 --> 01:21:25.820]   In order for you to do physics,
[01:21:25.820 --> 01:21:28.880]   you can't do physics without math, without calculus.
[01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:31.320]   Newton invented calculus to do physics
[01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:32.500]   or chemistry, et cetera.
[01:21:32.500 --> 01:21:34.580]   You need high-level math to do it.
[01:21:34.580 --> 01:21:36.320]   Now, many teachers have dumbed it down
[01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:39.520]   and taught things without math, but why?
[01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:40.720]   Just wait.
[01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:45.720]   Doing science, you should master math and then do science.
[01:21:45.720 --> 01:21:47.560]   And it's not that there shouldn't be
[01:21:47.560 --> 01:21:50.120]   generalized scientific knowledge, but why?
[01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:52.000]   Why spend all this time drilling it?
[01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:55.200]   And so I think the primary emphasis with young children
[01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:59.120]   should be language because the brain
[01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:01.920]   is wired for language acquisition
[01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:03.440]   at an early age.
[01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:05.280]   And so for very young children,
[01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:08.080]   our academic focus should be language.
[01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:11.280]   Our parenting focus should be character,
[01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:16.100]   building within them and practicing the skills of character.
[01:22:16.100 --> 01:22:18.360]   But from an academic perspective, it should be language.
[01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:21.400]   And so it can be your primary language.
[01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:25.880]   It can be ancient languages, Greek, Latin, Hebrew, fine.
[01:22:25.880 --> 01:22:27.440]   It can be modern languages.
[01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:29.840]   We've done a lot with modern languages
[01:22:29.840 --> 01:22:31.740]   and are now doing classical languages.
[01:22:31.740 --> 01:22:34.480]   But emphasizing math at an early age
[01:22:34.480 --> 01:22:37.560]   doesn't seem super necessary.
[01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:40.880]   Rather, mathematical concepts can and should
[01:22:40.880 --> 01:22:44.240]   simply be taught in a very straightforward way.
[01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:47.360]   So if you go and you look at the Montessori people,
[01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:49.160]   if you look at some of the stuff they do
[01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:50.320]   with mathematical appreciation,
[01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:51.920]   or just playing with your child,
[01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:53.160]   teaching your child to count,
[01:22:53.160 --> 01:22:55.760]   teaching your child the basic concepts of addition
[01:22:55.760 --> 01:22:57.680]   and subtraction and multiplication, et cetera,
[01:22:57.680 --> 01:23:00.280]   with physical objects, lots of physical stuff,
[01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:01.960]   and not a lot of workbook math
[01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:04.220]   at the early years is appropriate.
[01:23:04.220 --> 01:23:06.380]   So last year I was reading a book.
[01:23:06.380 --> 01:23:08.580]   I found this fascicle, excuse me,
[01:23:08.580 --> 01:23:11.640]   this fascinating book called "Teaching the Trivium,
[01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:13.800]   Christian Homeschooling in a Classical Style"
[01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:15.920]   by Harvey and Laurie Bluedorn.
[01:23:15.920 --> 01:23:18.460]   And I was interested in the book primarily
[01:23:18.460 --> 01:23:20.860]   because while I appreciate a lot
[01:23:20.860 --> 01:23:24.620]   of what the so-called classical educators have to say,
[01:23:24.620 --> 01:23:28.800]   I'm not a big fan of the so-called classical cultures.
[01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:32.400]   I think that Greek thinking has damaged many aspects
[01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:35.320]   of our modern world, especially Christianity.
[01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:36.920]   Not a big fan of St. Augustine
[01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:38.800]   and the Greek thinking that has been applied.
[01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:42.380]   I see it as a major problem in much of modern Christianity.
[01:23:42.380 --> 01:23:44.520]   And the Roman and Greek societies
[01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:47.040]   were just disgusting societies
[01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:50.320]   that maybe I appreciate some aspects
[01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:52.080]   of the architecture and art and whatnot,
[01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:54.480]   but I'm no Hellenist and I'm no Latinist myself.
[01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:55.460]   I'm no Roman.
[01:23:55.460 --> 01:24:00.200]   They were disgusting, evil, horrifically sinful societies.
[01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:02.160]   But I've always found that if you go
[01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:05.680]   into the world of educational pedagogy,
[01:24:05.680 --> 01:24:07.960]   you find some of the most serious thinking
[01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:13.360]   in this space from classical educators.
[01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:14.800]   And so I've never quite figured out
[01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:16.640]   how to resolve this conflict.
[01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:20.920]   My, I don't wanna be too strong,
[01:24:20.920 --> 01:24:25.920]   but my lack of appreciation for Greek and Roman cultures
[01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:28.540]   while simultaneously appreciating many
[01:24:28.540 --> 01:24:31.140]   of the aspects of classical education.
[01:24:31.140 --> 01:24:32.880]   So I found this title of this book
[01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:34.420]   and I bought it not knowing what to expect.
[01:24:34.420 --> 01:24:35.800]   And I was blown away by how good it is.
[01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:37.460]   Again, it's called "Teaching the Trivium,
[01:24:37.460 --> 01:24:39.100]   Christian Homeschooling in Classical Style"
[01:24:39.100 --> 01:24:40.420]   by Harvey and Laurie Bluedorn.
[01:24:40.420 --> 01:24:44.060]   It's a fairly old book, published in 2001.
[01:24:44.060 --> 01:24:49.060]   So more than 20 years old.
[01:24:49.060 --> 01:24:52.760]   But in this book, they included an appendix
[01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:54.960]   on math instruction.
[01:24:54.960 --> 01:24:58.440]   And so in this book, they talk about basically
[01:24:58.440 --> 01:25:00.080]   the philosophy that I've just described to you,
[01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:02.520]   which is a philosophy I arrived at independent.
[01:25:02.520 --> 01:25:03.960]   And then I came across their thoughtful,
[01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:06.360]   well-researched position and it blew me away.
[01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:11.360]   And their basic idea is that children should not start
[01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:13.560]   what they call workbook math,
[01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:16.520]   which means a formalized workbook-based math curriculum
[01:25:16.520 --> 01:25:18.440]   until about the age of 10.
[01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:21.280]   And their experience with their children
[01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:26.040]   is that their children have been easily able to start
[01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:29.160]   their math instruction with basically fifth grade
[01:25:29.160 --> 01:25:31.000]   around the age of 10.
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:34.600]   So instead of spending hours and hours doing
[01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:36.680]   first, second, third, fourth grade stuff,
[01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:38.440]   just wait until your children are 10,
[01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:42.360]   do informal math instruction through real life living,
[01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:43.200]   and then around the age of 10,
[01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:46.280]   just start with a fifth grade math book.
[01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:48.040]   And that if any of their children,
[01:25:48.040 --> 01:25:49.360]   I think they had six children go through this,
[01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:51.560]   if any of their children struggled at all,
[01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:53.760]   in a few weeks, you can iron out and catch up
[01:25:53.760 --> 01:25:55.240]   on anything that was necessary
[01:25:55.240 --> 01:25:57.280]   in order to do the fifth grade textbook.
[01:25:57.280 --> 01:25:59.680]   Interestingly, this compares also with Robinson,
[01:25:59.680 --> 01:26:00.920]   Art Robinson's experience,
[01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:04.160]   his idea about math instruction as a scientist.
[01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:06.720]   Just simply have children learn their math facts.
[01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:07.720]   When they know their math facts,
[01:26:07.720 --> 01:26:09.340]   start with a fifth grade textbook.
[01:26:09.340 --> 01:26:13.000]   But they, in this book, include this remarkable appendix,
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.280]   which I think is really beautifully researched.
[01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:16.960]   And I wanna share it with you.
[01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:21.640]   Because while I have not chosen to put off intentionally
[01:26:21.640 --> 01:26:25.440]   all kind of formalized workbook instruction
[01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:27.000]   until fifth grade,
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:28.720]   I think that if your young children
[01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:30.380]   are struggling with math,
[01:26:30.380 --> 01:26:35.880]   it should not be a big focus for you if they're seven.
[01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:37.680]   I don't think you should expect your seven-year-old
[01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:39.760]   to sit down and do two hours of math a day.
[01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:43.200]   And so I wanna share this lengthy appendix with you
[01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:46.680]   as a tempering commentary on what I have said,
[01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:50.880]   and also something that is perhaps educational
[01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:54.320]   as far as some areas where perhaps we are wrong
[01:26:54.320 --> 01:26:56.400]   in our modern day on the teaching of math.
[01:26:56.400 --> 01:26:59.920]   I'm changing my mind on what I've just said to you.
[01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:03.080]   Looking at how far we are into this episode,
[01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:07.600]   I'm going to release this appendix as a separate audio file
[01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:08.800]   in the podcast feed here,
[01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:10.960]   rather than including it at the end of this episode.
[01:27:10.960 --> 01:27:13.560]   If I include it here, too many people will avoid the episode
[01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:15.400]   for sake of it being too long.
[01:27:15.400 --> 01:27:16.840]   And I don't want what I've said to be missed.
[01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:19.720]   So let me instead sum up this
[01:27:19.720 --> 01:27:23.000]   and hope you'll listen to that appendix separately.
[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.040]   At its core, we're trying to strengthen
[01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:27.200]   our children's minds.
[01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:29.400]   We want them to be smarter
[01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:31.400]   so that they will be better learners
[01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:34.840]   and be able to lead themselves to greater success.
[01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:38.760]   Numeracy, encouraging and developing numeracy
[01:27:38.760 --> 01:27:42.520]   is a fundamental way for us to accomplish that.
[01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:47.000]   So we want our children to do lots and lots of math.
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.120]   It will grow their gray brain
[01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:51.640]   into be a bigger and more powerful muscle.
[01:27:51.640 --> 01:27:54.920]   And regardless of whether they ever enter
[01:27:54.920 --> 01:27:58.800]   a scientific career or a career in which they use the math,
[01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:01.960]   the practice of doing math every day
[01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:04.240]   will increase their intelligence.
[01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:06.440]   Frankly, you and I should be doing math every day
[01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:08.560]   for these same benefits.
[01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:11.760]   And if math is not your thing,
[01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:16.560]   doing Sudoku or crossword puzzles or something is key.
[01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:19.400]   In terms of staving off dementia,
[01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:21.240]   helping us to be smarter, et cetera,
[01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:24.480]   we need to be challenging our brain and making it think.
[01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:26.880]   And math is perhaps the best way to do that.
[01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:30.320]   So don't force too much math on your children.
[01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:31.440]   If your children are young
[01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:33.480]   and they're not doing well with math, back off.
[01:28:33.480 --> 01:28:38.040]   Focus on language at an early age rather than mathematics.
[01:28:38.040 --> 01:28:39.920]   But as your children get into math,
[01:28:39.920 --> 01:28:42.720]   require them to do math every day
[01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:45.480]   so that they will develop the character
[01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:48.440]   of doing hard things first thing every day,
[01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:51.360]   and so that they will become deeply numerate
[01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:54.320]   and become smarter, more accomplished,
[01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:56.120]   better educated individuals
[01:28:56.120 --> 01:28:58.960]   who know how to teach themselves the things that matter.
