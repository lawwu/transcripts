[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.680]   Hi, I'm Abner Chow, one of the translators for the Legacy Standard Bible.
[00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.000]   We've been laboring and praying over this translation, and we've been encouraged because
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.040]   the Lord has graciously even begun to answer our prayers through you because of your response,
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:22.560]   and we've been encouraged by your heart and love for the Word of God and the God of the
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.560]   Word.
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.400]   And along with your responses, you've raised some really good questions, and we're very
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.480]   thankful for that because it reflects the heart that seeks after the Word of God, and
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.200]   it provides us some opportunity for edification, and that's what we like to do at this time.
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.440]   I've been asked to answer some of these questions in a little bit more casual, a little bit
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.320]   more personal environment, and so I'm in my office right now, one of the locations where
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:54.880]   I have worked on this translation to deal with and to respond to some of your questions,
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:00.460]   and I hope that this time will be one of great edification and learning.
[00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:06.040]   So without further ado, let's walk through four questions that you all have posed to
[00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.440]   us.
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.920]   Here's the first one.
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.960]   Why does the Legacy Standard Bible italicize certain words?
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.600]   Well, that's a really important question.
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.560]   That's a very, very vital question because any translation, including the Legacy Standard
[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.080]   Bible, it's a tool.
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:32.560]   It's an instrument that we use to study God's Word more, and so we want to know how to use
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.560]   it.
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.800]   And in light of that, the whole purpose, the whole design of the tool of the Legacy Standard
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:47.640]   Bible is to understand what was originally written in Greek, Aramaic, and Hebrew.
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:54.080]   It is supposed to be a window into the original languages, and so the words and the phrases
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:00.720]   found in the Legacy Standard Bible are designed to correspond exactly with the words and grammatical
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.360]   features of the original languages, and that's where italics comes in.
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.560]   Words that are in italics are telling you that while this word is inferred by the original
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:18.620]   text and needed to make sense of things in English, the word itself in italics does not
[00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:27.080]   inherently correspond to a word found in the original language or grammatical feature therein.
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.960]   That's what italicized words indicate, something that is there and has a function to help make
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.920]   sense of something in English but not found in the original.
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.000]   And that's important for Bible study because we don't want to base our theology or make
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.560]   a huge point on italicized words.
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.960]   They have a purpose, but it's not that.
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:53.040]   Here's a second question that has come across my desk, and that is, "Why does the Legacy
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.340]   Standard Bible put Old Testament quotations in small caps?"
[00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.920]   That's another really excellent question because, again, it helps us to understand how to use
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.300]   this resource, the Legacy Standard Bible, better.
[00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:13.640]   As you probably know, the Legacy Standard Bible, even by its name, is designed to preserve
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:20.160]   the New American Standard Bible, and that translation upheld the notion of putting Old
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.880]   Testament quotes in small caps because in Greek New Testaments that modern-day scholars
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:32.600]   use, we designate and delineate Old Testament quotations in one way or another, and so the
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:37.840]   New American Standard, and by extension, the Legacy Standard Bible, brings that over to
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.740]   the English reader.
[00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.000]   And that really has two benefits.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.200]   Fundamentally, it has the benefit of alerting us as readers when the Old Testament is being
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.600]   quoted by the New Testament so that we catch some very important cross-references and connections
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.480]   and we see how the new is connected with the old and importing the theology from old to
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.480]   new.
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.080]   We might not be able to detect these normally otherwise, and so this is just a helpful tool
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.640]   for us to make those important and vital associations.
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:16.520]   And secondly, what we call "typography," the different typesetting, helps us to quickly
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.000]   locate certain passages.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.240]   You might think, "Oh yeah, I was looking for this one verse and I remember there's this
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:27.260]   Old Testament quote nearby, it's in small caps," and that helps us to find texts faster.
[00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.880]   So those are some tools and tips for you.
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.480]   Here's a third question.
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:38.920]   Why does the Legacy Standard Bible capitalize pronouns referring to deity?
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:44.020]   That's another great question, and again, it goes back to preserving what the New American
[00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.120]   Standard Bible did.
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:50.120]   The Legacy Standard Bible is not the only translation that does this, and it does this
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.820]   for two reasons.
[00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:57.160]   One is because we want to show honor, in at least a very small way, we want to show honor
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.240]   to our God, who is far greater than man.
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:06.740]   And second, it helps you to track along with what the original author intended.
[00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:13.000]   The author might have, and does often, clearly delineate grammatically that a pronoun refers
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.400]   to God, and so we wanted to show that so you know when this pronoun is talking about God,
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.620]   and when a pronoun is not talking about God, it's talking about man.
[00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:29.220]   So when it was grammatically clear and unambiguous, we capitalized pronouns that referred to deity.
[00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:34.320]   When there was any debate or possibility otherwise, we wanted to be safer than sorry, so we left
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.460]   it lowercase but designated it by a footnote.
[00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:45.100]   A final question, the fourth and final question, and this is a longer and more involved question,
[00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.060]   but it's an excellent question, and it's this.
[00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:55.800]   Why does the Legacy Standard Bible retain "only begotten" in its translation of John 3:16?
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.700]   Like I said, this is a really great question, and I empathize with it, because we know how
[00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:07.820]   the cults have abused and misused the phraseology of "only begotten" to wrongly insinuate that
[00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:10.200]   Jesus is created or made.
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.400]   That is completely false.
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:17.080]   And so I can understand our desire to want to translate it something like "one and only"
[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.840]   or "the only one."
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:23.580]   That's a quick and clear conclusion that you can draw from a translation, and there's definitely
[00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.220]   room for that for that very reason.
[00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:31.840]   But part of what is in translation, and particularly with the Legacy Standard Bible, is to communicate
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:39.600]   what the text says, and also through that to be a window into why it says fully what
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:40.600]   it says.
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:44.240]   It's a platform for theology in that way.
[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:50.480]   And to be clear, research has demonstrated without a shadow of a doubt that the word
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:57.020]   "only begotten" in Greek does not inherently and certainly does not always denote creation
[00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:58.660]   or being made.
[00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:04.740]   There are plenty of times when the Greek Old Testament translates using this word for "only
[00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:10.520]   begotten" a Hebrew word which means "only one," "exclusive," "one and only."
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:17.840]   And so to be sure, the Greek word does not necessarily or inherently mean creation at
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:18.840]   all.
[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:20.600]   That's a false implication.
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.480]   It does move toward uniqueness.
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:28.200]   But it's not just good enough to say what a word does not imply or does not mean.
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:31.740]   We need to know what it does mean and means fully.
[00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:36.860]   And recent research, say in the last five to ten years, has really brought this forth
[00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:38.240]   once again.
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:42.840]   For instance, we know that in John, he makes a big deal about birth.
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.200]   John chapter 3, "born again."
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:48.560]   That's the very context of John 3, 16.
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:53.200]   And in 1 John, we have the language of "having been born of God."
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:59.080]   John really does, as the apostle, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, emphasize
[00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.080]   the notion of birth.
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:05.080]   And that matters because that ties into the notion of begotten.
[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:06.920]   And we need to recover this notion.
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:13.440]   And a good illustration of that is found in Psalm chapter 2, Psalm 2.
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:19.080]   And that passage says, "Today I have begotten you."
[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:23.200]   Now the background of that passage, the historical background of the whole text and the whole
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:30.040]   concept of begetting, comes from coronation, coronation, a son becoming king because he's
[00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:32.080]   begotten of his father.
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:33.480]   Now think about this with me.
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.160]   How do sons become kings?
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:37.480]   It's because their dad was a king.
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:40.480]   Because they share the same family heritage.
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:43.360]   Because they're of the same genealogical line.
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:47.320]   Because they have the same royal blood flowing through their veins.
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:53.200]   And so the declaration of begetting is a declaration, "Son, we share something together.
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.440]   We're united in something.
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:00.680]   And that's why you have the same status that I do, even though we're distinct persons,
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:02.000]   father and son."
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   It's unity even though there is distinction.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.400]   Well what makes then Jesus so unique, so exclusive in John 3:16?
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:18.700]   It is because he perfectly shares, he absolutely shares with his father the exact same nature
[00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:23.480]   and essence because they are one in nature and essence.
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:29.080]   That is what is going on with the idea of begetting even as they are distinct persons.
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:35.040]   They perfectly share, they are perfectly in union in their essence even as they are distinct
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:36.520]   persons.
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:39.860]   That is the notion of begetting and we need that.
[00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:41.120]   We need that.
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:45.520]   Remember, John talks a lot about the new birth, about birth.
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:47.040]   How are we born again?
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:55.120]   Why and how can we be changed so that we can share in God's holiness and commune with him?
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:10:04.360]   It is because God always, internal to himself, eternally, forever, has shared himself with
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:05.360]   his son.
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:12.920]   They are one in essence, one in nature, even as they are distinct persons.
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:18.800]   And it is because God has always done that internally and eternally to himself that you
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:25.480]   can have the conceptualization for why God can do that in a derivative way with those
[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:30.040]   who are created actually and external to God.
[00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.120]   That would be like you and me.
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:35.860]   And so, only begotten, there is a lot of theology in there.
[00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:42.080]   It not only affirms wholeheartedly the deity of Christ, maybe counter to our first instinctive
[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:47.960]   reactions, but that is what it says, union between the two even as distinct persons,
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:54.560]   the connection and union and sharing absolutely between Father and Son, but it also tells
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:57.280]   us why that matters, why we need it.
[00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:01.480]   Because if you don't have that Trinitarian interaction, then there's no platform, there's
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:09.800]   no foundation, no conceptualization for how we are saved and we can relate to the Father
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:13.240]   and the Son and the Holy Spirit and the entire Godhead.
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:19.600]   Put it simply, God's relationship eternally with his Son is the only reason why we can
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:23.600]   have a relationship with God himself.
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:29.280]   And so it shows us that every word of Scripture matters and your questions are great because
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.600]   they remind us of that.
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:36.620]   And so along that line, while we definitely encourage you to read the preface to the Legacy
[00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:42.060]   Standard Bible and visit our FAQs on the website, which can answer a bunch of questions.
[00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:47.800]   If you or your friends or a bunch of you have a question, please get in contact with us
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:54.560]   through the Contact Us part of the LSB website and send us your questions so that we can
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:57.000]   have more opportunities for edification.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.760]   Well, I hope that's exactly what has happened.
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:01.280]   Thank you for your questions.
[00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:06.760]   Thank you for investing yourself in the Scripture and I hope to learn more with you all soon.
