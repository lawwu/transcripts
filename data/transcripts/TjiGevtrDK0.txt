[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.460]   - Did you always know you wanted to be a neuroscientist
[00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:06.100]   from the time you started college?
[00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.000]   What was your trajectory?
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.500]   I should know this, but you were an undergraduate at?
[00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.340]   - At Princeton.
[00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.780]   - At Princeton, that right, studying?
[00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:13.620]   - Math.
[00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:14.780]   - Math.
[00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.180]   So you could have just done all your work
[00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:17.380]   with a piece of paper and a pen,
[00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.160]   but you had to try and engineer all these electrodes.
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.620]   Okay, that's a pen and paper pen.
[00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.580]   - I took a very random route.
[00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.620]   I studied math as an undergrad.
[00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.140]   I spent a few years running around playing music
[00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.120]   and traveling and living a bohemian life.
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.220]   - Tell me more about that.
[00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.440]   - Oh, it was, I basically just told you
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.940]   all I'm going to tell.
[00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.900]   - Following the Grateful Dead.
[00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.340]   - No, not quite following them,
[00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.120]   but that was an important part of the story.
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.100]   - Was that an important part of your personal development?
[00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.100]   - Yes, very much so.
[00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:54.100]   Free expression, dance, music, creative, exploratory music,
[00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.540]   all that kind of stuff.
[00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.460]   - Such a contrast to the EJ that comes forward
[00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.700]   when we're talking about the precision
[00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.920]   of neural stimulation in specific retinal cell types.
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.860]   But I think it's useful for people to hear
[00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.000]   both young and old, like that one's nervous system
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.100]   can be partitioned into these different abilities.
[00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.560]   You're like, go and dance and travel,
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.100]   and you weren't doing anything academic at that time.
[00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.500]   - No, for a few years I wasn't doing that,
[00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.060]   programming computers to make a living.
[00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.240]   And then I started three different PhD programs
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.460]   at Stanford before I started-
[00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:26.300]   - Simultaneously?
[00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.140]   - No, no, no.
[00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.960]   - Oh my goodness.
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.540]   - In sequence, I started in the math PhD program.
[00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.500]   I learned that was not really for me.
[00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.820]   And I started in an economics PhD program
[00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:35.980]   in the business school there.
[00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.220]   And I realized after less than a year,
[00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.380]   that was not for me.
[00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.180]   I worked in a startup company for a while.
[00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.900]   I did a lot of stuff for a few years
[00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.400]   and took some settling.
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.300]   But then I decided to go into neuroscience.
[00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.940]   And there were a couple of formative things.
[00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.940]   One is that I had gotten a really formative experience
[00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.180]   as an undergraduate from a wonderful guy
[00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.000]   called Don Reddy,
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.980]   who taught an introductory neuroscience course,
[00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.920]   who was really inspiring mentor.
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.000]   And then when I was at Stanford,
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.880]   I met Brian Wandel, my PhD advisor,
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.740]   and I was inspired by him.
[00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.940]   I thought, I didn't know why he was studying,
[00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:14.760]   what he was studying,
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.720]   but I just knew I wanted to learn from this man.
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.780]   And I wanted to study with him.
[00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.260]   I just knew this was the person who should be my mentor.
[00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.420]   - Based on something about him.
[00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.320]   - Yes.
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.620]   - Can I ask you about these three PhD programs?
[00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.020]   Because I think people here,
[00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.740]   or see what you're doing
[00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.740]   and probably imagine a very linear trajectory.
[00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.180]   But now I'm hearing you like tour around playing music.
[00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.100]   Then you start a PhD program.
[00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.940]   Nope.
[00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:40.760]   Then another one.
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:41.600]   Nope.
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.420]   Then another one.
[00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.260]   Without getting into all the details.
[00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.700]   I mean, were there nights spent lying awake,
[00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.100]   thinking like, what am I gonna do with my life?
[00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.060]   Or did you have the sense
[00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.780]   that you knew you wanted to do something important,
[00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.940]   and you just hadn't found the right fit for you?
[00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.340]   Like how much anxiety on a scale of one to 10,
[00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.060]   10 being total panic,
[00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.620]   did you experience at the apex of your anxiety
[00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:00.860]   in that kind of wandering?
[00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.220]   - Am I allowed to go above 10?
[00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.180]   Like turning up the amp to 11?
[00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.020]   - Sure.
[00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.800]   I just think it's really important for people to hear
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.220]   whether or not they want to be scientists or not.
[00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.600]   This idea that people that are doing important things
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.280]   in the world, in my view,
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.300]   rarely if ever understood that that's the thing
[00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.180]   that they were gonna be doing.
[00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.620]   There was some wandering about.
[00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.220]   - That sure seems like it, doesn't it?
[00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.060]   Yeah, I experienced the same when I talked to other people,
[00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.880]   and it seems like that.
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.660]   And for sure, for me.
[00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.460]   It just took a while of trying different things
[00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.180]   to see, number one, what I was really good at,
[00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.020]   and where I felt I could make a difference.
[00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:41.020]   And I realized I studied math, and I was okay at math,
[00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.500]   but I know, I have known mathematicians
[00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.620]   who are really talented, gifted mathematicians,
[00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.100]   the one who really make a difference.
[00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.180]   I wasn't gonna be one of those people.
[00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.580]   Likewise, playing music.
[00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:52.940]   I don't have that intrinsic talent.
[00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:53.760]   It's fun.
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.700]   I can play songs in front of people and do stuff.
[00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.560]   I like it and stuff like that,
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.220]   but I don't have that kind of talent.
[00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.020]   In fact, I'll say something that I say to friends sometimes,
[00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:04.620]   and you're a good friend of mine.
[00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.300]   If I had the talent to get a few thousand people
[00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.000]   on their feet dancing by playing music,
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.340]   I'd probably just do that.
[00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.300]   - Really?
[00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.940]   As long as we've been friends, I knew none of this.
[00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.040]   I knew none of this.
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.740]   Mostly because I think we always end up talking
[00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:22.020]   about neuroscience or other aspects of our life,
[00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:26.140]   but I didn't know, I mean, I know a great many things
[00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:27.620]   about you, but I had no idea.
[00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.100]   It's so interesting.
[00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.420]   Do you still do dance?
[00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.540]   We had Eric Jarvis on the podcast, by the way,
[00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.380]   professor at Rockefeller who studies,
[00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:40.220]   at one point was studying speech in birds,
[00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.480]   as in song in birds.
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.780]   And then he's done a great many other things now
[00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.740]   in genetics of vocalization.
[00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.740]   And he actually danced with or was about to dance
[00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.900]   with the Alvin Ailey Dance Company.
[00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.940]   So he had really, really talented dancer.
[00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.540]   And so dance seems to be like a theme that comes up
[00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.460]   among the neuroscience guests on this podcast.
[00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:04.620]   Do you still dance?
[00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:05.500]   - Yeah, I love to dance.
[00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:06.660]   I'm a free form dancer.
[00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.020]   I'm not a skilled dancer, but I love music.
[00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.860]   I love dancing.
[00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.340]   I think it's part of the human spirit.
[00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:12.940]   I someday will understand the neuroscience
[00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:13.900]   behind dancing, right?
[00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.480]   Dancing is a universal human thing in all cultures.
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.700]   What is this dancing thing?
[00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.700]   Why do we do this and other creatures don't?
[00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:23.020]   - Well, Jarvis thinks that perhaps it's one
[00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.660]   of the more early forms of language.
[00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.380]   And that song came before spoken language.
[00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.580]   It's sort of interesting that birds
[00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:36.380]   that can actually recreate human speech
[00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.980]   oftentimes have the ability to dance as well.
[00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:39.820]   - Oh, wow.
[00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.140]   - And so there's some common circuitry there.
[00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:44.820]   We'll provide a link to that episode.
[00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:45.860]   Jarvis, a really interesting guy.
[00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.520]   - I would love to hear that.
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.880]   But if I may, I'd like to riff on that in a different way.
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.780]   I did spend some time wandering around, as many people do.
[00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:58.020]   And I think particularly for your young listeners
[00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.700]   and viewers who don't know, wow, could I ever be a scientist
[00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:03.300]   and develop new things, stuff like that?
[00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.140]   Yes, you can.
[00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:05.620]   And if you're messing around in your life,
[00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:08.460]   trying this, trying that, trying the other thing,
[00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:09.940]   definitely stick with it.
[00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.260]   Keep looking for the thing that works for you.
[00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.140]   I really deeply believe that.
[00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:15.260]   You gotta play around.
[00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.820]   You gotta find what it is that works for you.
[00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:21.580]   Interestingly enough, at least it's interesting for me,
[00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.060]   I spent a lot of years studying the retina
[00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:26.580]   in a pure basic science,
[00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.680]   just curiosity-driven research way,
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.940]   as you and I have both done in the past.
[00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:37.700]   And as it turned out,
[00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:41.880]   I learned all the stuff I needed to know about the retina
[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:46.880]   to develop a high-fidelity adaptive retinal implant
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.420]   of the type that I'm talking about in that process.
[00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:51.340]   The technology, the stimulation, recording,
[00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:52.180]   figuring out the cell types,
[00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:53.780]   how do you stimulate, all that stuff.
[00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:55.820]   I learned all that stuff.
[00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:59.060]   And I have come to a point in my life where I realize,
[00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:03.140]   wow, if somebody's gonna do what I think needs to be done,
[00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:05.620]   which is to take everything we've learned about the retina
[00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:09.020]   and instantiate that in smart technology
[00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:10.020]   that can restore vision
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.920]   and do all the things we've been talking about,
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.780]   who are the people in the world
[00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:16.920]   who have the right training and background
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:19.460]   and know-how to do that stuff?
[00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:21.740]   I'm one of them.
[00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:22.820]   I know that.
[00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:25.860]   And it's totally by chance that I picked up and learned,
[00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:27.780]   or it seems by chance that I picked up and learned
[00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:30.360]   the things that I need to know for this.
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:33.620]   But I definitely have the right know-how to do this
[00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.740]   based on all my training and the research that I've done.
[00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:37.360]   And it feels accidental sometimes.
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:38.700]   I look back on my own history.
[00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:40.420]   I'm like, how did I get here
[00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:43.060]   where this is obviously the thing I need to do?
[00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:44.900]   Was this on purpose?
[00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:46.420]   It didn't seem like it was on purpose,
[00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:48.300]   but now I gotta do this
[00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:50.020]   because I know what needs to be done
[00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:51.380]   and it's something that needs to be done.
[00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:55.860]   So that's my mission for the coming decade or so.
[00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:56.700]   - Wow.
[00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:00.220]   I mean, I knew you had this engineer, mathy,
[00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:01.340]   geeky neuroscience.
[00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:02.180]   I don't wanna say geeky,
[00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:04.300]   'cause it makes it sound like I'm not right there
[00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:06.500]   in the same raft with you.
[00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:10.820]   But I didn't know about this more free-spirited
[00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:11.940]   move in all directions,
[00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:15.580]   depending on what one feels in the moment, dancing EJ.
[00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:16.640]   It's very cool.
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:22.060]   Are you still a absolute level 11 coffee snob?
[00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:22.900]   - Yes.
[00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:23.720]   - Okay, yeah.
[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:24.560]   I used to go to meetings
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.300]   and EJ would bring his own coffee maker
[00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:29.180]   and coffee to meetings.
[00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:30.780]   We're not talking about an espresso machine.
[00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:34.420]   We're talking about like extreme levels of coffee snobbery.
[00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:36.500]   - Press pot, the correct ground coffee,
[00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:37.820]   the correct kind of press pot, yeah.
[00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:39.100]   - Good, good, good.
[00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:40.620]   I expect nothing less.
[00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:43.620]   Proof that not all circuits in the brain are neuroplastic,
[00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:44.580]   nor should they be.
[00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:45.420]   - That's right.
[00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:48.900]   - But to bridge off of that in a more serious way,
[00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:55.540]   despite the free exploration aspect to yourself
[00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:59.940]   and that hopefully other people don't suppress,
[00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:04.900]   it seems like you really are good at develop,
[00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:05.980]   like knowing your taste.
[00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:08.420]   Like it seems like the,
[00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:09.780]   I think it was the great Marcus Meister,
[00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:12.340]   a colleague of ours who has also worked
[00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:14.260]   on the neural retina extensively, of course,
[00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.580]   who once said that there's a coding system in the brain
[00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:20.260]   that leads to either the perception,
[00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:25.260]   the feeling of yum, yuck, or meh.
[00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.220]   And that so much of life is being able to register that
[00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:30.540]   in terms of who you interact with and how,
[00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:33.140]   and the choices or problems to work on.
[00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:37.100]   It seems like you have a very keen sense of like, yes, that.
[00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:38.500]   And you move toward that.
[00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:41.300]   You've always been very goal-directed
[00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:42.580]   since the time I've known you.
[00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:46.540]   So, and you've picked such a huge problem,
[00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:49.820]   but going about it in such a precise way,
[00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:53.220]   hence the analogy to the space mission.
[00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:57.200]   So like when you experience that,
[00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:00.620]   may I ask, does it come about as like a thought?
[00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:02.100]   Like, oh yeah, that has to be the thing,
[00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:03.900]   or is it like a whole body sensation?
[00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:04.940]   - What a great question.
[00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:06.100]   I love that question.
[00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:08.140]   I have two things to say to that.
[00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:11.360]   The first is that for me, it's all feeling.
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:17.500]   I don't make hardly any decisions out of thoughts.
[00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:21.700]   I think, I process, I put it all into the hopper,
[00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:23.660]   and the hopper comes out and spits out a feeling,
[00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:26.460]   and the feeling's like, yeah, that's the thing to do.
[00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:27.380]   A hundred percent.
[00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:29.260]   And I know not everybody's like me.
[00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:30.580]   Lots of people aren't like me,
[00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:33.140]   and particularly lots of scientists aren't like me.
[00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:35.660]   But I definitely roll that way.
[00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:37.740]   That is absolutely how I work.
[00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:39.620]   There's something that's related to that
[00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:42.540]   that I think is philosophically,
[00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:43.980]   and in terms of personal development
[00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:45.660]   and spiritual development stuff,
[00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:48.500]   I think is quite relevant that I think you'll relate to.
[00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:53.920]   My favorite aphorism is know thyself, the oracle.
[00:10:55.460 --> 00:11:00.160]   And I think, because if you don't know yourself,
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.700]   you can't do anything.
[00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:03.780]   You don't even know where to go.
[00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:06.260]   You can't even orient yourself
[00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.360]   at the next thing in your life.
[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:13.800]   And I think it deserves to have two corollaries
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:16.460]   that go with it, or addenda.
[00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:21.980]   Know thyself, be thyself, which is not easy.
[00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:24.500]   It's not easy to really be yourself in this world.
[00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:26.340]   There are all sorts of things telling us
[00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:28.300]   to be something other than what we are.
[00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:31.500]   And the third one is love thyself.
[00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:36.660]   And it's, you know, having gone through much exploration
[00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:41.700]   of yourself and your life and your values and me too,
[00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:43.980]   and all the things we've talked about over time,
[00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:45.140]   that's not easy.
[00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:48.500]   Some of us are not necessarily programmed to love ourselves.
[00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:50.700]   And it's a skill.
[00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:55.060]   And I really, I try my best
[00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:57.400]   to be with those three things all the time.
[00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:00.220]   Know thyself, be thyself, love thyself.
[00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:02.380]   - Could you elaborate a little bit more
[00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:04.460]   on your process for the third?
[00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:08.760]   This is a concept that has been very challenging for me,
[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:10.500]   and I think for many other people.
[00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:15.900]   And it gets kind of opaque
[00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:17.660]   when it starts getting conflated
[00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:20.100]   with like self-respect and et cetera.
[00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:23.740]   Like loving thyself, do you have practices?
[00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:25.460]   Do you meditate?
[00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:26.760]   Do you journal?
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:31.460]   Do you spend time trying to cultivate a love for self?
[00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:32.580]   - Yeah.
[00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:35.020]   Yeah, I meditate in an informal way
[00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:36.920]   in the morning with my coffee.
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:40.620]   Every morning I make a fantastic cup of coffee.
[00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:43.660]   And I sit with it for five or 10 minutes
[00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:46.180]   and take in my world as it's coming toward me
[00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:49.100]   and start to, as I come into the day
[00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:52.700]   and come into consciousness, I meditate like that.
[00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:56.100]   And I have a Ashtanga-related yoga practice.
[00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:58.900]   Many of your viewers and listeners
[00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:00.180]   will know about Ashtanga yoga.
[00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:04.840]   It's a very physical, spiritual, traditional yoga practice
[00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:08.100]   that has a deep meditative and breath-focused component.
[00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:09.940]   I know you've had lots of episodes and discussion
[00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:13.140]   about the breath and the importance of that for awareness.
[00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:18.760]   You know, at the end of many Western yoga practices,
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:21.900]   you end with namaste, which is expressing your respect
[00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:26.180]   and for the connectedness of what is in front of you
[00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:27.580]   to the whole universe
[00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:31.380]   and what's common to all of us and everything.
[00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:34.100]   And I usually practice yoga by myself.
[00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:37.100]   When I say namaste at the end of my yoga practice,
[00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:40.020]   a part of that is to myself.
[00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:42.180]   - Earlier, when I asked you about
[00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:46.620]   how you guide your decisions, you said, "It's all feel."
[00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:48.660]   And you provided a beautiful description
[00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:51.480]   as to how and why that occurs for you
[00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:52.740]   and your trust in that.
[00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:56.640]   I don't recall you saying whether or not
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:59.840]   the feeling is in your head or it's a whole body feeling.
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:01.640]   Does it have a particular signature to it
[00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:02.920]   that you'd be willing to share?
[00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:05.080]   Is it excitement that makes you want to get up and move
[00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:06.640]   or is it a stillness?
[00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:09.920]   I think I ask because we've been talking
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:12.320]   throughout today's episode about the precision
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:13.840]   of neural coding and the signals
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.440]   that are at the level of individual cells.
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:17.860]   And yet, when it comes to feeling,
[00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:21.860]   we actually have a pretty crude map
[00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:23.620]   and certainly a deficit in language
[00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:25.860]   to explain what this feeling thing is.
[00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:28.300]   And I know that people experience life
[00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:29.200]   and feelings differently,
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:31.380]   but I think it's often insightful
[00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:35.020]   when somebody with your understanding
[00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:38.300]   of the nervous system and yourself can share a bit.
[00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:40.020]   What does it feel like?
[00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:42.980]   - I love that question.
[00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:45.260]   And it relates to something you said to me
[00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:46.180]   years ago.
[00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:51.600]   What it feels like is ease.
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:54.920]   And I remember years ago when we were talking
[00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:56.340]   about challenging things that each of us
[00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:59.420]   was facing in our lives, you said to me something like,
[00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:02.640]   "I wish for you some ease with all of this."
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:06.240]   It was very moving, touching.
[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:07.960]   As that's what a good friend does
[00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:11.120]   is to give that to somebody who they love.
[00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:16.120]   And it sticks with me probably 10 years later.
[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:22.580]   So the feeling I feel when I'm on the path
[00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:26.340]   that makes sense for me is ease.
[00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:31.340]   It's, there's just, it's just, okay, this is it.
[00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:32.660]   - Thank you for tuning in
