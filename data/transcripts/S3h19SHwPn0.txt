[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.380]   Professor John, last time you talked
[00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:07.760]   about the changes you have watched
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.720]   develop in the racial landscape in America
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.920]   over the last 50 years, since you were a boy in South Carolina.
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.520]   Do you have any predictions or longings
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.600]   as you look into the future?
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.840]   Well, I don't have as many predictions as I do longings,
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.640]   but let me make a go of it.
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.160]   When it comes to ethnic diversity,
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.960]   we should never forget one massive certainty.
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.240]   This gospel of the kingdom will be preached
[00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.040]   through all the world as a testimony
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.640]   to all the ethnicities.
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.840]   And then the end will come.
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.440]   Ethnic reality should be thought of globally,
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.400]   not just in narrow, local ways alone.
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.640]   And this certainly is true about the Great Commission,
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.720]   and the certainty of the success of the Great Commission
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.800]   is there because Jesus bought it with his blood,
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.080]   according to Revelation 5.
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.480]   Now, you were slain, and you bought people
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.640]   from every tribe and tongue.
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.440]   So that's going to happen.
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.880]   That's the first thing I think we should say about the future.
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.920]   All the ethnicities are going to bow their knee to Jesus someday.
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:31.760]   Number two, I see the continual unraveling
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.480]   of the historic, traditional overlay of biblical morality
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.640]   in America.
[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.920]   For years, there was an external conformity
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.280]   with significant biblical convictions
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.680]   left over from Christian influence in this country.
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.360]   This is collapsing, and will continue to do so, I think,
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.680]   so that true Christians who submit
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.720]   to the authority of God's Word in the Bible
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.640]   will feel increasingly alien.
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.280]   This collapse, it seems to me, is being accompanied, however,
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.400]   by profound renewal and reformation
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.240]   of many churches and schools and movements and families.
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.240]   Many, many will give way and show
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.360]   their true colors of compromise, and many others
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.360]   will grow stronger and clearer in their allegiance
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.720]   to the Lord Jesus.
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.160]   So the dark gets darker, and the light gets lighter.
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.440]   That's going to happen, I believe.
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:44.360]   Number three, there will be an ongoing increase
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.280]   of globalization and multi-ethnic, multicultural
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.040]   reality here at home.
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.040]   We will feel ourselves increasingly
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.120]   part of a global reality near and far
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.320]   that 50 years ago was almost inconceivable
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.360]   for our insulated American mindset.
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.920]   And that increase of global diversity at home
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.920]   means that by 2043, according to the census predictions
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:21.000]   after 2010, America will not be a majority white country.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.800]   And that is something that should be celebrated
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.280]   as the gospel works here, not feared.
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.160]   Number four, alongside all this diversity,
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.960]   will continue the outbreaks of evil from the human heart.
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.160]   Nothing has changed about the condition of the human heart.
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.400]   A lot of times people think with changes in society and changes
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.320]   in culture, people are getting better or worse.
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.560]   They're not.
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.880]   People get better through conversion to Christ.
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.080]   Apart from Christ, no one seeks for God.
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.520]   No one does good.
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.960]   There's just variations on the way
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.200]   our corruption expresses itself.
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.280]   The lynchings that happened 50 years ago
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.240]   come from the same heart that exists today.
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.240]   There is as much innate depravity as ever.
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.680]   It is constant.
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.560]   What changes is the kind of constraints
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.200]   society applies to inner sinfulness.
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.560]   So Eisenhower would have been impeached and removed
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.720]   from office for the immoral sexual behavior of Bill
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.560]   Clinton.
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.120]   And Bill Clinton would have been impeached and removed
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.440]   from office for the racial slurs that presidents
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.280]   got away with 50 years ago.
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.880]   What's changed is not their hearts,
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.320]   but what Americans will tolerate.
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.400]   Sinfulness doesn't change.
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.800]   Social restraints and tolerances change.
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.360]   But they can't restrain racism completely.
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.840]   And it will break out one form or another.
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.680]   That's who we are globally.
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.200]   Just a couple more.
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:06.400]   Alongside lukewarmness and open immorality and apostasy
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.800]   in the Church, the true bride of Christ
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.960]   will grow in conformity to Christ.
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.400]   She will be filled with the fruit of righteousness
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.840]   that comes through Jesus Christ.
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.360]   So the glory and praise of God, Philippians 1, 11.
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.240]   And that will include beautiful expressions
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.320]   of racial and ethnic togetherness and harmony,
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.400]   with many Christians globally and at home
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:40.080]   taking concrete steps to move toward differences in love,
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.400]   not away from them.
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.520]   And the last thing maybe to say would be,
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.200]   like Brian Lawrence and the Kainos movement
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.560]   that we've talked about before, I
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.960]   think many initiatives of thousands of pastors
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.480]   and ministry leaders and churches
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.040]   will give themselves to prayer and to study
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.960]   and to public effort to pursue Christ-exalting,
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:09.080]   God-centered, Bible-saturated, gospel-shaped ethnic diversity
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.520]   and harmony.
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:15.120]   It's a difficult, strategic time to be alive.
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.920]   And I pray the Lord keeps us faithful.
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:18.680]   Yes, and amen.
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.440]   Thank you, Pastor John, for that.
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.960]   This reminds me of an episode in the Ask Pastor John podcast
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.160]   series we released not too long ago titled "Churches Pursuing
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.240]   Ethnic Diversity," episode number 315.
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.320]   There you explain some very concrete ways
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.280]   a church can pursue racial diversity
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:34.960]   in their own community.
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.160]   And tomorrow is Friday, and we will wrap up the week
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.240]   by wrapping up this little four-part series of episodes
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:39.800]   on race.
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:43.320]   And we'll conclude by looking at Martin Luther King, Jr.'s most
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:44.720]   powerful words.
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:45.840]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.720]   We'll see you tomorrow.
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:50.840]   [NO AUDIO]
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.320]   [NO AUDIO]
[00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.380]   you
