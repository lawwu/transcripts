[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Why do my pre-conversion sins still haunt me?
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   That's the question today. Here's the email.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   "Hello Pastor John, my name is Rico and I have a question about past sins resurfacing.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   Before I was saved a little over a year and a half ago, I was pretty badly addicted to drugs.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   I met the Lord Jesus and literally all the desires to pursue drugs went away
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   until about April of this year.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   I've fallen a few times, but God has been very gracious and merciful to me
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   in carrying me through these rough times.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   So I guess what I'm asking is, how does this come about?
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   I thought I was done with that part of my life for good.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   Why are my pre-conversion sin patterns coming back now?"
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   Rico, let me give a short description of what the Bible teaches about what has already happened to you
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   as a born-again believer in Jesus and what has not yet happened to you.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   And this will give you some biblical ways of thinking about what you are actually experiencing.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   Let's put this description of the already of your life and the not yet of your life
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   into the larger biblical description of what Christ has already done in the world
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   and what he has not yet done in the world.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   When Christ came into the world, you know this, he preached the kingdom of God.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   And in that preaching, he said two things.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   Number one, the kingdom is here. It's here right now.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   "Behold, the kingdom of God is in your midst," Luke 17:21.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   "I am the king. My rule has arrived.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   I am showing in my miracles, in my teaching, in my perfections, in my love, in my death for sinners, in my resurrection.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   I am showing my kingdom, my rule, my saving reign is here.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   The long-hoped-for, waited-for kingdom has come."
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   That's the first thing, crucial thing, essential thing for Christianity to say.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Here's the second thing he said. "My kingdom is coming and is not yet here."
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Luke 22, 18, "I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes."
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   What? I thought you said it had come. Why are you saying it's coming?
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   It's coming, but not yet.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   So in the big picture of history, the kingdom of God has already come in the person and work of Jesus,
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   and yet, how should we say it, not yet fully come, completely come, not yet come with the fullest consummation.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   I remember reading one time in George Ladd, one of my New Testament professors years ago,
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   he said, "The mystery of the kingdom is fulfillment without consummation."
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Fulfillment without consummation. That captures the tension.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Yes, yes, the kingdom has come. Time is fulfilled. It is here. Repent. The king has come.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   But the consummation, so many things left that are not yet done that the kingdom promised to do.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   And that tension, Rico, affects virtually every part of the Christian life, including your struggle with past sins, including drugs.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   So how does this work itself out in the life of individual Christians?
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Here are just a few biblical descriptions of this already not yet reality in the Christian life.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   First, Colossians, Colossians 1, 3 and 4, God has delivered us from the domain of darkness
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved Son in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Wow. Already done, already transferred out of darkness into the kingdom of the Son.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   Glorious. That's awesome.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   And then verse 3 says, "You have died. Your life is hidden with Christ in God."
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   It's over. I mean, you've already passed beyond death. You are secure and hidden with Christ in God.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   But now comes verse 5 of Colossians 3 with this imperative that suggests something is very not complete.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   It says, "Put to death, therefore, what is earthly in youâ€”sexual immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, covetousness, which is idolatry."
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   And we could add drugs. That needs to be done, Rico. It needs to be done.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   You are in heaven with Christ. Now fight the sins of earth.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   You have died. Therefore put to death old habits.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   And notice the "therefore." The battle with sins that are not yet destroyed is because of the already being dead with Christ and being seated at his right hand.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   That's number one. Here's another picture of it in Romans 6. Here's verse 6.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   "We know that our old self was crucified with Christ." So death. We're done. It's over. We've died.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   Verse 11, "So you must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God."
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   Because something is not yet complete. You've got something to do with this.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   So again, the command to complete this, finish this, bring your life into accord with your deadness, is based on the fact that you're already dead.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   Here's the third picture of it later on in Romans 6. Verse 11 says, "Let not sin reign in your mortal body."
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   That's the "not yet." And now the "already" of verse 14.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   "For sin will have no dominion over you, since you're not under law, but under grace."
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   Don't let sin reign because it won't reign.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   There's the Christian way of life. Here's a fourth picture of it.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   1 Corinthians 5, 7, talking about getting sexual sin out of the Church and out of our lives.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   It says, "Cleanse out the old leaven, that you may be a new lump."
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   So it's picturing the Church and the Christian life as a lump of dough and leaven as sin penetrating the lump.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   It says, "Cleanse out the old leaven, that you may be a new lump, as you really are unleavened."
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   So again, the command about getting out the leaven is based on the fact that there's not any leaven.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   There's the glorious "already, not yet" mystery as it applies to the Christian life.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   We are becoming what we are.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   Here's one more, Ephesians 4, 24, "Put on the new self created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness."
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   So put on what already has been created.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   So your new self has been created. It's the work of God.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   You're not forging a new self in Christ. You're not. You're not forging a new self in Christ.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   God made that. He created that.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   It's already created, but you must put it on, own it, wear it, become in practice what you are in Christ.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   So, Rico, your ongoing struggle with sin is nothing new.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   You already are new in Christ, and you are not yet perfected.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   You are dead and must put sin to death.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   You are raised with Christ, and you must seek the things that are above.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   You are a new self, and you must put on the new self.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   You are unleavened, and you must cleanse out the old leaven.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   Sin will not be king in your life, and you must not let sin have dominion.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   And so here's the key. Every imperative, every command, every exhortation, every admonition given to a Christian
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   should be passionately pursued, obeyed on the basis of what's already true about us in Christ.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   We are commanded to become what we are, become in life what we are in Christ.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   So what you are experiencing is the reality of what Paul calls in Romans 7:20, "Indwelling sin,"
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   remaining in dwelling sin, the not yet of sanctification.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   And you are now to put that sin to death because you have already died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   So, Rico, may God take this biblical picture of salvation deep into your life and give you a great freedom.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   Amen. That's a great episode for us all to take with us into our battles with personal sin.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for the great question, Rico. I really appreciate that.

[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   That's the question coming up next time, and it has a very practical bent to it.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke. We'll see you next time on Wednesday.
