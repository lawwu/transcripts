[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.640]   - Are you a list maker?
[00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.160]   Like do you wake up in the morning and make lists
[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.940]   and cross things off and then decide
[00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:08.620]   what are the key items on that list?
[00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:09.900]   - No, I'm a time blocker.
[00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.580]   - Time blocker, okay.
[00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.420]   - Yeah, so I'm not a big believer in to-do list.
[00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.260]   I like to grapple with the actual available time.
[00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.660]   Like, okay, I have a meeting here.
[00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.500]   I have to like pick my kids up from school here.
[00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.220]   Here's the actual hours of the day that are free
[00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.460]   and where they fall.
[00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.420]   All right, what do I want to do with that time?
[00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.460]   Well, okay, now that I see that there's a lot of gaps
[00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.140]   in the middle of the day here, they're short.
[00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.540]   Maybe there I'm gonna do a lot of small,
[00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:31.780]   non-comically demanding thing.
[00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.460]   Oh, this first 90 minutes in the morning
[00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.460]   is like the main time I have uninterrupted.
[00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.020]   Okay, so this I'm gonna work on writing.
[00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.980]   So I've been a big believer of this since I was an undergrad.
[00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.540]   Like you give your time a job
[00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.920]   as opposed to having a list, which is somewhat orthogonal
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.220]   to what's actually happening in your day.
[00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.620]   And then just as you go through your day saying,
[00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:49.820]   what do I want to try to do next?
[00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.340]   Which I think is a lot less efficient.
[00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.580]   - I'm gonna try your method.
[00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.360]   I try and structure my days as much as I can,
[00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.900]   but it just never quite works.
[00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.180]   Do you work late into the night or are you, no?
[00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.240]   - No, I'm a 5.30 man.
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.900]   - Okay, so 5.30 PM, that's it?
[00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.140]   - Yeah, more or less, that's my cutoff.
[00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.640]   Now, the one exception is if I'm writing on deadline,
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.280]   I'll sometimes, like if I need to get more writing done,
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.720]   I can do an evening writing session,
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.840]   which I got used to through long experience.
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.380]   I used to write my blog post at night
[00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.800]   after like my kids went to bed.
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.560]   Now they're older and they don't go to bed as early.
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.600]   So it's like the one thing I have left
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.680]   that I'll do after 5.30 is like every once in a while,
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.920]   I'll do like a 90 minute evening writing block.
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.880]   But I call this, by the way, this whole philosophy,
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.480]   I call fixed schedule productivity.
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.540]   I've been doing it since I was a grad student.
[00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.480]   Fixed to work hour schedule.
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.680]   That's my commitment.
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.480]   I work in these hours.
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.540]   And then work downstream from that for everything else.
[00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.080]   So like this controls like even what you decide
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.920]   to bring into your life
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.200]   because you know I can't go past a schedule.
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.840]   And it drives you to be more innovative
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.460]   in how you deal with your time and schedule.
[00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.960]   You have to be efficient because you only have
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.680]   these hours here.
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.120]   That's been a signal for my life
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.520]   since I was in my early 20s.
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.700]   Fixed to schedule and don't work outside of that schedule.
[00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.040]   Now it's your move to figure out anything you wanna do,
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.880]   you have to make that work.
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:08.720]   You wanna become a professor,
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:09.960]   figure out how to make that work.
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.520]   You wanna write books while you're being a professor,
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.640]   figure out how to make that work.
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.880]   You don't have the option of just throwing hours at it.
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.200]   And you innovate a lot, I think,
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.940]   when you have the constraints.
[00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.680]   - Where do sleep and exercise fit into your schedule?
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.800]   What's your typical to bedtime, wake up time?
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.480]   What's your typical exercise routine?
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.080]   And the reason I ask about this is because
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.260]   I think nowadays we, hopefully people understand
[00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.560]   that exercise and cognitive function
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.160]   are inextricably linked.
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.240]   And we're all going to live longer lives
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.760]   and be sharper mentally by doing exercise.
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.600]   - Yeah, so I mean, my main, like actual working with weights,
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.280]   I do this pre-dinner, right?
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.080]   And this was an innovation in the last couple of years.
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.200]   It's fantastic psychologically for me.
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.320]   This is a transition from work
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.920]   to like family time after work.
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.520]   So I'll do like 45, 50 minutes garage gym,
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.240]   you know, that we built during COVID.
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.200]   After I'm done working, before dinner.
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.320]   And once you get used to that,
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.560]   like it also forces you like, I gotta finish work
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.240]   'cause I gotta get this in before dinner.
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.920]   But then I'll do also quite a bit of walking
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.280]   if it's not a teaching day, so I'm not on campus.
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.720]   I do a lot of thinking on foot, you know,
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.000]   walking my kids to the bus stop,
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.340]   which isn't particularly close and back.
[00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.200]   So I'll do a lot of walking,
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.360]   but that's when I, my serious exercise now
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.160]   is always pre-dinner.
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.720]   Then I wanna be up, you know, in our room by 10.
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.200]   And then at that point I don't track.
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.480]   So I have insomnia issues,
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.680]   which actually has been like key driver
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.200]   of a lot of the things I think about,
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.980]   especially with slow productivity,
[00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.720]   is I'm very wary because I can,
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.020]   without any control on my own,
[00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.920]   just find myself unable to sleep sometimes.
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.160]   - Fall asleep or stay asleep?
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.320]   - Fall asleep, yeah.
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.440]   I mean, I used to get it really bad.
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.900]   Not so bad now, but you know, it comes and goes.
[00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.640]   That really affected the way I thought about productivity
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.320]   because it seemed like to me,
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.120]   the definition of just,
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.460]   I get after it with a bunch of stuff
[00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.000]   wasn't really on the table
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.860]   because if my notion of productivity depended on me,
[00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.200]   like every day being able to just like hammer on
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.680]   a bunch of stuff, I'm very busy,
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.980]   I have lots of commitments,
[00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.080]   what would happen if I couldn't sleep?
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.120]   I wouldn't be able to do that.
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.880]   So I drifted naturally
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.480]   towards a definition of productivity,
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:20.160]   which was it doesn't really matter if you work tomorrow,
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.120]   but it is important that like this month you work,
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.960]   like writing a book.
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.840]   It doesn't matter if you work on your book chapter
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.320]   tomorrow in particular,
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.440]   but like this month you have to spend
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.400]   a lot of time working on it.
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.360]   So it was like an insomnia compatible
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.480]   definition of productivity
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.580]   was sort of morphed into this idea of slow productivity,
[00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.240]   taking your time with it.
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.080]   So it's interesting.
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.680]   So like sleep issues really shaped the way
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:40.520]   I thought about work
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.200]   and put me on these much longer timescales of productivity.
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.480]   Try not to be dependent on any particular day
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.480]   being critical to what you do.
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.360]   I don't want the high stress situation.
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.800]   I don't want the, like, I'm just gonna 10 hours a day
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.840]   for the next 10 days, we're gonna make this deal happen.
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.480]   Like I can't operate in that space
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.480]   'cause I worry about it anytime my brain could betray me
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.820]   and I could like lose sleep for a couple of days.
[00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.840]   - I think it's really important that you're sharing this
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.600]   because while people's challenges differ,
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.920]   I think oftentimes people hear the content of my podcast
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.400]   or other podcasts and think,
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.060]   oh gosh, I have to have everything dialed in just right.
[00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.680]   When in fact, most all of the tools and protocols
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.160]   that have been discussed on the Huberman Lab podcast
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.680]   are in response to a particular challenge that I've had
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.520]   or that others close to me have had.
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.960]   And I love this.
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.640]   Well, I'm sorry that you suffer from insomnia.
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.760]   We have a series on sleep with Matt Walker
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.000]   in which he lays out some great tools
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.560]   that we haven't yet discussed on the podcast.
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.240]   I'll just send you, I'll text you,
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.920]   I'll call you with a short list of those
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:42.760]   and hopefully they'll help.
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.240]   But as we do cover insomnia in some depth,
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.080]   but I think it's important that people realize
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.560]   that they can be very productive
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.840]   with the hours that they have
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:55.240]   and the moments or hours of high focus clarity
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.700]   that they have, even if they're not sleeping great,
[00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.320]   even if they're raising small children
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.360]   because that's the real world.
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.520]   And certainly that's the real world of deadlines
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:10.520]   and academia, but family and colds and flus
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.840]   and travel and jet lag and arguments
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.360]   and all the happy stuff too, vacations.
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:20.040]   So sounds like you're very good at adapting your day
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.720]   to what's going on around it,
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.640]   but that you have certain sort of committed time.
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.680]   Am I correct in assuming that you have
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:32.680]   at least one period of say 60 to 90 minutes of real,
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.720]   what you would call deep work,
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.320]   let's say at least five days a week.
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.760]   I know that might be an underestimate,
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.580]   but it seems like that's what I'm extracting from this.
[00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:42.420]   - That's the goal, right?
[00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:45.040]   So to me, depending on the season
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.580]   is how extreme that can get.
[00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.880]   So the busiest season would be like a teaching semester,
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.920]   right, but even then I'm gonna make sure
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.800]   that five days a week, I'm starting with deep work
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.720]   and the non-teaching days are more than the teaching days.
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.560]   Compare that to the summer, for example,
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.840]   where like all I do for the most part is deep work,
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.720]   no meetings on Mondays and Fridays,
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:06.320]   all admin stuff is midday to early afternoon,
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.000]   Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.680]   Everything else is deep work,
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.840]   just locked in hours at a time.
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.680]   But I want, if I'm not getting five days,
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.600]   five days of starting the day with deep work,
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.420]   I'm unhappy, right?
[00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:21.360]   Because I mean, I keep coming back to this is,
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.480]   okay, because I'm not gonna be able to,
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:24.960]   I mean, fortunately the insomnia doesn't bother,
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:25.800]   it hasn't bothered me in years,
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.280]   but the threat of it like completely shaped
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.560]   the way I think about things.
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:32.000]   And because I know I'm never gonna be,
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.240]   I have sort of like an Elon Musk style energy
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:36.080]   of like, I can just take on seven companies
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:37.000]   and make it happen, right?
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.040]   I just don't have that ability.
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.680]   I've always focused on the long game.
[00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.760]   And to me, the long game plays out with
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.640]   get your deep work time in.
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:47.880]   You know, just keep working on the stuff you do best
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:48.960]   and get better at it.
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.520]   You know, tomorrow doesn't matter.
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:53.040]   But if you're doing this most days for the next four months,
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.440]   like that's gonna matter, you know?
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.880]   And so I often think about productivity in my own life
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:58.400]   at the scale of decades.
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.040]   Like what do I wanna do in my 20s?
[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:01.680]   You know, okay, what do I wanna do in my 30s?
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.080]   You know, what do I wanna do in my 40s?
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:04.720]   You know, and that helps.
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.120]   Like in my 30s, I had a lot of young kids.
[00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:06.960]   Like it's, yeah.
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:10.160]   I mean, the amount of time I could spend total working
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.640]   is like much less, right?
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:12.560]   But I could still think about
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.320]   what do I wanna do in my 30s?
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:15.600]   How do I make that happen?
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:18.560]   Let me make sure I'm pushing like on those things.
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:19.920]   Then everything else I can adapt to,
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.000]   I can give here and there.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.120]   You know, it allows you to be very adaptable
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.760]   when you're thinking about what do I wanna do,
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:25.880]   you know, for the next 10 years.
[00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:29.160]   It also means you're not on a random Tuesday
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:30.720]   chiding yourself because like,
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.520]   why didn't I get three more hours of work?
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:34.800]   That becomes sort of a nonsensical question.
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:35.800]   And what you care about is like
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:37.120]   what happens in the next decade,
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:38.440]   which is, that's the long game.
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:41.720]   It's not about, you know, hustling today.
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:45.200]   It's about I came back to deep work day after day after day
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.000]   when other people got distracted by TikTok.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.360]   You know, like I gotta, you know, whatever.
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.960]   It's that coming back to what matters again and again.
