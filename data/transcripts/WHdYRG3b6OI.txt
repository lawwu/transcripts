[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.680]   Pastor John, in a previous podcast you expressed how important deep and rich
[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.880]   theology is in the fight against porn addiction and lust. That was the theme of
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.200]   podcast number 19, and I want to revisit this and look more closely at how
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.200]   Christian men can serve each other. What would you say to a man who has friends
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.000]   committed to helping him win the battle against lust and porn addiction?
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.080]   Yeah, I've been thinking a lot recently about Paul's text in 1 Corinthians 9
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:37.280]   where it says he pommels his own body. The word is literally, he gives his body a
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.400]   black eye. He says, "I don't box beating the air." In other words, "I know where to land
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.520]   my punches." And he's talking about the sins in his life that need to be
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:51.160]   punched out. They need to be put to death. And so he's talking about a kind of
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.880]   self-denial and a kind of self-opposition that stands up and pokes himself, and I
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:02.480]   think he's just extending Jesus' words where he says, "If your eye causes you to
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.720]   sin, tear it out." Well, that's a pretty good punch, you know, to the eye. I mean, it's
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.880]   taking your eye out. And if your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. Now, we
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.440]   know that's not meant to be literal because he says, "If your right eye
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.920]   causes you to sin, tear it out." Well, you've got your left eye left over, and you need to
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.440]   see the naked woman just as well with your left eye as your right eye. So we
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.760]   know that the literal tearing out of the right eye wouldn't solve the problem. He
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:35.120]   means be as vigilant and as forceful in your opposition of sin as you need to be
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:42.640]   in order to kill it in your life. Now, here's my new wondering. Why? Why does
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:49.480]   lust, why does seeing—I'm thinking mainly men, but not just men—why does seeing
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:58.160]   have such a force to draw us to click on pornography or to linger over some
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:05.480]   bathing suit issue of Sports Illustrated or to linger over some ad for a movie?
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:11.740]   Just what is it about us? And as I've tried to analyze my own body over the
[00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:19.360]   years, I've got this phrase that I use called "psychoerotic euphoria." I made
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:26.760]   that up. "Psychoerotic euphoria." What I mean is, I don't know what it is or where it
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.800]   is. I'm very localized in the body. It can get localized, but it isn't localized
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:41.160]   usually, and it's just like power in your body that makes you so pleased by the
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:49.240]   erotic, by the visual, that you are moving toward it visually with such a
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:55.600]   force that it starts to nullify moral conviction and puts you out of touch
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:02.100]   with all the arguments you had before to be pure and moves you into behavior that
[00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.180]   you then later are going to disapprove of. What in the world is that like? And my
[00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.440]   answer is, it's like drunkenness. So if you go to a bar, suppose me, I'm just
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.720]   making this up, you go to a bar with a buddy and you're a witness for
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.840]   Jesus tonight at the bar, and you sit there, and this guy that you're with
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:26.920]   starts drinking, and he drinks too much, and he gets drunk, and you say, "Well, this
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.840]   is obviously not working. We're going to win anybody to Jesus. Now we've just
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.200]   disobeyed Jesus by getting drunk, and so we're going to go out of here." So you grab
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.720]   his arm and say, "We're leaving." And he's the one who drove tonight, and so he wants to
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.320]   drive and go down and watch a movie downtown while he's drunk. And you say, "You're not
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.960]   driving. I'm not going to let you drive. It's my driving. I'm going to drive this car." And you
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:52.000]   bend his arm back behind his back and throw him in the backseat and grab his
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.560]   key, and since he's your friend, he doesn't hit you. And you drive him home
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.120]   and throw him in bed. Now that's a lot of manhandling for a drunken guy.
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.520]   Is that right? Should we do that? And I think most people would say, "Yeah, yeah, you
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.400]   should do that. I mean, he was drunk. He's going to kill himself." And my question is,
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.480]   is there something like that that we should do for each other? If this
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:22.680]   psycho-erotic euphoria is as powerful as drunkenness, and I think it is, then do we
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.840]   need people in our lives who will break our arm? I mean, not just, you know, Paul says, "I palm
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.160]   on my own body." I'm saying, "You should palm on me." In other words, should I have...
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.240]   You know, we often talk about accountability relationships, and a lot
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.360]   of people get all bent out of shape about legalism, and you're supposed to
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.920]   love Jesus from your heart and not have to be constrained. Look, if you're drunk
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.120]   and you're about to kill yourself, you better be glad somebody's in your life
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.400]   to throw you in the backseat of the car, and later on, when you wake up, you'll be
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.240]   glad they did, and then you can pray yourself back into some kind of
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.320]   appropriate stance where you obey freely from your heart. But this lust thing is
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.880]   much more like drunkenness than it is like anything else, and so we may need
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:10.360]   this kind of personal accountability where we have some kind of connection,
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.960]   some kind of special number on our cell phone, some way to push a button and say,
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.900]   "Knock me out if you have to in the next half hour because I'm about to lose it
[00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:25.640]   because of this psycho-erotic euphoria that's come over me like drunkenness." So
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:31.120]   I'm just throwing that out there to guys to say, compare it in your life. Analyze
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:40.160]   your own soul to see whether the sheer physical, erotic, psycho nature of this
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:45.960]   power is enough like drunkenness that you would put a thing in your
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:51.480]   life like, "Drive me home." Yeah, I can see how this point gets applied to a
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:55.960]   brother stumbling in sin in our presence. So much of pornography and lust, however,
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:00.080]   is a private struggle in the darkness of isolation. How does this principle work
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:05.800]   out there? Right, so I'm saying when Hebrews 3:13 says, "Exhort one another
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:10.560]   every day as long as it is called today, lest there be in you an evil heart of
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:17.000]   unbelief," you would extend that out and say, "Perhaps throw one another in a cold
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.640]   shower every now and then so that there won't be an
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:30.360]   acted-out heart of inebriated psycho-erotic drunkenness in a person's
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:35.560]   life." If a guy is fighting a losing battle and most of the guys know who
[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:40.000]   they are, or gals know who they are, about, "Okay, I'm supposed to fight this. I'm
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.560]   supposed to win it. I'm regularly losing this battle." If they know that, they need
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:50.400]   to say that to their small group, and then one idea would be, "I'm going to put
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:56.160]   your number at the top of my favorites on my iPhone. It'll take one punch, and I
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:01.280]   want you to give my number a special ringer on your phone, okay?" So it goes, "Do,
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:06.480]   do, do, do, do," and you say, "Okay, the only time he ever hits that number is when he
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:10.560]   needs me to intervene." And so you get on the phone, and you get on the phone and
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:18.520]   say, "Stand up. Go outside in the snow," or "I'm coming over right now," or
[00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:22.280]   something. You just have it worked out just the way you would if you were an
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:27.040]   alcoholic, you know, and he were saying, "I'm just moving towards this bottle on
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:30.760]   my wall. I don't know what it is. I want you to come smash the bottle for me." I mean,
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:37.000]   it's that weird. I mean, why else would Jesus say things like, "Cut your eye out"?
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.360]   I mean, that's just wild. If somebody says, "Oh, that's wild to put a special
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:44.760]   number on your phone." Really? Like, take a screwdriver and poke it in your face?
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:52.360]   That's not wild? So I'm saying, when Hebrews 3:13 says, "Exhort one another
[00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:57.080]   every day as long as it is called today, lest there be in you an evil heart of
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:03.480]   unbelief," you would extend that out and say, "Perhaps throw one another in a cold
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:09.120]   shower every now and then so that there won't be an
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:16.800]   acted-out heart of inebriated, psycho-erotic drunkenness in a person's
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:20.880]   life." Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for listening to this podcast. Please
