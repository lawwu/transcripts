[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320]   I think this goes to the question that you talk about in your books, which is like, I
[00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.160]   want to do something great, but I don't know what that is.
[00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.640]   And you just said you have a number of vague sort of passions or interests.
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:18.440]   Well, I think I think what I would do in that position is sort of first off, where do I
[00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.040]   have time that I'm wasting?
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:33.040]   I'm Cal Newport, and this is Deep Questions, episode 215.
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:40.840]   I'm here in my Deep Work HQ, joined by my producer, Jesse.
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.280]   Jesse, one of the things I'm excited about today is we have a guest.
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.760]   Which has been a little while, but it's definitely been one of our ambitions to have
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.680]   more interviews on the show, so to help kick off a season in which we may have more of
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.640]   those coming, I sat down with our friend of the show, good friend of the show, Ryan
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.240]   Holliday.
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.920]   Exciting stuff.
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.320]   Yeah, he has a new book coming out.
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.160]   Discipline is Destiny.
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.960]   It comes out this week, the week that this podcast comes out.
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.640]   He is on track to sell, and this is the official number I just got from Bookscan, all
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.120]   the copies, what that says there.
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.400]   He has quite the following, so I think this book's going to do quite well, but it was a
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.960]   good, good chance to good chance to catch up.
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.600]   I'll say the long-term plan for guests, in case you're wondering, is in the future, what
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.960]   we would like, it might take us again a couple of months till we're really there, two
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:38.880]   episodes a week.
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.880]   Always the standard Q&A episode, like you know and love Deep Questions.
[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.680]   It's us answering questions from you, taking calls from you.
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.560]   Other episode each week, doing a deep dive with a guest on a particular type of topic that we
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.960]   would cover normally on the show.
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.280]   So guest, Q&A, guest, Q&A.
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.920]   That's ultimately where we want to end up.
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.520]   The other exciting thing about today's guest episode is the first time in the history of
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.200]   the show that we have, knock on wood, video of guests.
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.280]   So that should be nice.
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.640]   I'm excited about that format.
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.280]   I can't wait to hear you talk to other people.
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.040]   Yeah.
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.440]   It's going to be great.
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.360]   Well, and I love the, you know, I love video.
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.280]   And so I like that we can also watch it.
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.600]   So at the youtube.com/countyreportmedia, we'll be able to release the video of Ryan and I
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.800]   talking as well as clips from our interview.
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.720]   And there's a lot of cool people I want to talk to.
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.200]   For me, my goal here is not so much of, I just want to have a bunch of famous people on.
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.840]   I'm happy having people return again and again.
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.240]   What I want to do is bring in other interesting thinkers that tackle the type of issues that we
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.920]   do on the show, that we tackle on the show.
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.360]   I want to bring in the most interesting brains, the people with the biggest experiences, the
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.600]   people who come at things from completely different angles.
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.440]   We could have certainly repeat guests.
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.640]   We tackle different topics each time they're here.
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.480]   We can have guests that are just here one time.
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.560]   I think there's a whole universe of interesting conversations to add into the mix.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.080]   So the Q and A is not going anywhere.
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.920]   And it might just be Q and A for a little while, more or less, but we're going to be
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.040]   adding more, more guests in the not too distant future.
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.600]   So, I mean, this conversation we had today was a great one.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:14.440]   We start by talking about, you'll hear the book, Discipline is Destiny.
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.040]   So we talk about discipline and why Ryan is writing about that, his main ideas.
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.840]   We do a little bit of advice by proxy.
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.560]   I say, OK, assume I'm a reader and this is my issue and I need more discipline.
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.080]   I'm in this circumstance. What would you do?
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.480]   OK, assume I'm in this circumstance.
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:30.440]   How should I think about this?
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:37.160]   And then as often happens when I get together with Ryan, we end up veering off to get in
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.000]   the weeds and play a little insider baseball on the publishing industry.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.280]   His and I similar rise through becoming writers and having media companies and how to
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.320]   balance that all. So we we end up covering, I think, a fair amount of topics.
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.280]   We kept it tight, right, Jesse, because he had a hard out.
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.520]   Yeah, we got a good, I think, one hour.
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.200]   Get in, get out, keep it tight.
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.760]   Yeah, it was a good conversation.
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.200]   No Joe Rogan style three hours here, but I think it's fine.
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.080]   I think it's good. So that's the plan.
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.240]   So what we're going to do is we'll cut to the interview and then after the interview,
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:16.440]   Jesse will join me again and we'll do a little bit of a post game analysis before we get
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.880]   the Ryan, though. Let me just mention one of the sponsors that makes this show possible.
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:26.360]   A new sponsor, but one I have really been enjoying in my own life, and that is Hinson
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.920]   shaving. This is a great idea.
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:38.280]   What they figured out at Hinson is that the issue with getting a good shave is not the
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:44.000]   blade itself, as the one of the founders of the company, so I talked to on the phone, told
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.920]   me we're perfectly capable of manufacturing very good, hard, sharp, stainless steel
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.160]   razor blades. They cost a dime and they're great.
[00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.400]   The blade is not the problem.
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.400]   The problem when it comes to getting a good shave and not getting nicks and cuts is
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.520]   stabilizing the blade, right?
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.800]   Just having a little bit of the edge appearing that you use to do the shaving with.
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.280]   If you have too much blade sticking out, it's like a diving board.
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.000]   It wobbles. And that's where you get the burn, the scrapes and the nicks.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.600]   So it's a blade holding problem is the problem, not the blade problem itself.
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:22.560]   So the way that most men shave is they buy these disposable razors either at the drug
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.760]   store through a subscription service where they're the blades are put in plastic.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.120]   And it's not super precise.
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.560]   So in order to try to get a better shave, they put many different blades into the
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:38.280]   plastic. So when I first started shaving, you had one blade and then at some point
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.440]   there was three blades.
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:45.960]   I think now the state of the art is a a wall of 74 blades and that you actually just
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.000]   slide down the wall and it tries to shave your face.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.840]   That's just compensating for the fact that you have these very expensive plastic
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.360]   enclosures aren't super precise.
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.600]   All right. Enter Hinson Shaving.
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:03.560]   This is a company that specializes in making precision parts for the aerospace
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.840]   industry. This is what they do is make very precision parts.
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.520]   So using their high end.
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:13.080]   CNC routing machines, they have built these beautiful aluminum.
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:21.560]   Razors that very precisely hold a standard 10 cent sharp razor blade such that I have
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:26.760]   the number here only point zero zero one three inches of the blade emerges beyond the
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.800]   metal edge. One blade.
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.480]   You get a great shave.
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.120]   I shaved with it this morning.
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:37.760]   So, yeah, you pay more to get the original beautifully made metal razor, but then you
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.040]   have that for life.
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:42.920]   You know how much it costs to get a year supply of standard blades?
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.680]   Like five or ten dollars.
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:49.840]   So, yes, it feels like it's a little bit more money up front, but it takes, what, three
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.120]   months of not having to buy the things at the drugstore, three months of the subscription
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.440]   service. You're already making money.
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:58.080]   And also, I just love the idea of getting rid of the plastic, getting rid of the
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:02.560]   disposability and just having one beautifully made thing that can work with a 10 cent
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.280]   razor blade and give you a great shave.
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.560]   So I'm a big fan of Hinson Shaving.
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.920]   So it's time to say no to subscriptions and yes to a razor that will last you a

[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:54.160]   Justin, do you remember there was a while in the disposable razor war days where at one
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:55.720]   point there was a razor that vibrated?
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:58.480]   No. Yeah, it made all men nervous.
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:01.880]   It was like, all right, not only do we have five blades, but for some reason you have a
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:06.880]   battery in this and the whole razor shakes to like, you know, it's going to get you a
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.200]   better whatever. It's like, that's just nerve wracking.
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:12.480]   Yeah, it's going to slice your face.
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.040]   So it's good to Hinson.
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:15.080]   Hinson razor, you'll be fine.
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:21.000]   I also want to talk about Wren, W-R-E-N, which is a startup that's making it easy for
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.400]   everyone to make a meaningful difference in the climate crisis.
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:28.240]   It is a simple idea, but a very effective one.
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:36.600]   You go to Wren's website, which is Wren.co, W-R-E-N.co.
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:43.400]   They help you calculate your carbon footprint, your personal carbon footprint, and then
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:48.360]   you can purchase offsets that match the amount of carbon that you are producing in your
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:50.520]   standard day to day life.
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:56.240]   So it is a concrete way for you to actually try to improve your impact on the
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:58.840]   environment in a very quantitative way.
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:02.680]   So right now, the service is focused on monthly subscriptions where you do that
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:06.280]   calculation, your carbon footprint, and then you offset it.
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:12.120]   The projects that they're working on now to offset it as tree planting, rain forest
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.760]   projects that plant trees and protect rain forest.
[00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:16.840]   So those are the type of offsets you're going to get.
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:21.160]   The goal of Wren is to unlock the collective action of millions of individuals to drive
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:25.080]   the systemic change needed to end the climate crisis.
[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:26.440]   So that's what you do.
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:34.640]   You go to Wren, calculate, offset, and you will feel better about your impact on the
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:35.120]   environment.
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.240]   It is an easy way.
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:42.600]   Sign up for Wren is an easy way to do something meaningful about the client crisis.
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:43.920]   It's a good idea.
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:46.960]   So it's gonna take all of us to end the climate crisis.
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.600]   Do your part today by signing up for Wren.
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:55.200]   Go to Wren.co/deep, sign up, and they will plant an extra 10 trees in your name.
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:58.280]   That's W-R-E-N.co/deep.
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.120]   Start making a difference.
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.040]   All right.
[00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:02.920]   So enough sponsors.
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:10.560]   It is time now to get to my conversation with author extraordinaire Ryan Holiday.
[00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:18.360]   works yes it's just I'm bored so the new book discipline is destiny it's coming
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:22.620]   out the same week that this podcast releases so if you're hearing this it's
[00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:26.920]   out or about to come out let's start there I want to get into the book so
[00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:32.960]   this is one of four books based around the four Stoic virtues it's the second
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:37.460]   one you had the first book was courage is calling so the stoic virtue it's it's
[00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:42.360]   often translated the relevant virtue is temperance yeah what's going on here
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:46.340]   what's the thinking behind discipline is the term you used for the title well the
[00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:52.480]   problem is in America because of the temperance movement around the turn of
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:58.520]   the 20th century which sought to forbid the sale and consumption of alcohol
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:05.400]   people think that temperance means not having any of something right temperance
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:10.520]   is is really rooted in the idea of balance or moderation like finding the
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:16.440]   right amount a better word for this a Greek word is soft for Sinai which means
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:22.560]   or self self mastery so when you see the Stoics talk about this one of the four
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:28.040]   virtues courage temperance justice wisdom you often see it rendered as
[00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:35.600]   self-discipline which I think is a much more accessible and practical and and I
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:40.960]   would say urgent of the topics and so I decided not to spend a whole book
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:45.600]   talking about you know how do you find the right amount of something and
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:50.280]   instead talk about what you do once you know the right amount of something which
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:55.720]   is be disciplined about it so the book pivoted around that which I tend to find
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:12:01.360]   is the critical question on all all book projects which is you have this general
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:06.600]   vague idea of something you want to write about but what is the handle that
[00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:10.040]   the book is built around or what's the shelf that it's on like when you wanted
[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:15.160]   to talk about sort of devices and our relationship with screens etc I've got
[00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.720]   to imagine it wasn't till you sort of come up with the idea it's like this is
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:22.820]   about minimalism applied to technology that you sort of figure out what it is
[00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:26.960]   you're going to say and how you're gonna say it I mean that is interesting that
[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:32.080]   that's a shift if it with this specific topic and you talk about it in the book
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:35.840]   and in you know various interviews you've done when you go back to let's
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:40.840]   say Aristotle yeah right we get a lot of the the mean that we go to the
[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:44.960]   Nicomachean ethics it's all about trying to find the what you should be pursuing
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:49.000]   that middle ground between excess and and and paucity and there was a lot of
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.080]   focus on that and you're right that seems less relevant to people today it's
[00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:58.600]   not the I know this is what the amount of exercise I should do this is where I
[00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:02.280]   should be with drinking this is the actual self mastery so where the Stoics
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:05.920]   because I don't know him as well as you obviously so where the Stoics locked
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:10.360]   into that self-control self-discipline piece of this more than you would see in
[00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:13.960]   let's say the non-stoic ancient Greeks like you would see an Aristotle for
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:18.100]   example I think so yeah it's a good question I mean and for me what's
[00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:21.440]   interesting is so much of like the knowing what the right amount of
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:28.880]   something also to me that fits pretty neatly under the under the the
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:36.480]   discipline or the virtue of wisdom or prudence right and so I I have taken
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:40.240]   some liberties in moving separate I'll give you another example so the Stoics
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:48.160]   typically rendered endurance as one of the elements of courage right so like
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:51.520]   that when they were talking about all the the sub virtues of courage they
[00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:57.160]   would talk about endurance but to me endurance quite clearly falls under the
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:00.720]   virtue of self-control or self-discipline right it's it's how do
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:04.520]   you hang on how do you how do you last through something how do you push
[00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:09.040]   through something so I I haven't really felt any compunction about moving stuff
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:14.120]   around I feel more than entitled to do that especially when you're thinking
[00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:21.880]   about temperance as a topic that probably isn't on its own big enough or
[00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:29.200]   interesting enough to go the distance for someone for a perspective reader so
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:32.200]   I really wanted to talk about self-discipline which I think most
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:38.360]   people believe they don't have enough of do you differentiate between the
[00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:42.320]   different flavors of this because people and I think discipline there's these
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:45.960]   broad categories that come up there's physical obviously yeah there's
[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:50.040]   self-control in terms of addictions and consumptions there's self-control in
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:55.240]   terms of productive focused application to effort what's the ontology that you
[00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:59.600]   find useful with this idea so I ended up splitting the book in three parts that's
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:02.760]   how I'm kind of doing each structure I'm kind of thinking in it even in the terms
[00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:07.720]   of like beginning intermediate advanced but the way I did it here was the first
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:12.320]   is sort of physical discipline so that's like what you eat that's what you do
[00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:16.680]   that's what your environment looks like then it then it goes into sort of
[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:24.320]   temperament or the sort of emotional mental discipline so focus you know
[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:31.960]   controlling your temper you know push it pushing oneself and then the third part
[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:37.320]   is kind of a fusing of those together where sort of in the real world someone
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:44.280]   is has that sort of almost monk like or or transcendent level of self-discipline
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:49.160]   like kind of under fire so that's that's kind of the the structure I was thinking
[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:54.680]   about and and you're right it's self-discipline isn't just not doing
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:59.840]   things it's also doing something so the epigraph of the book I have a quote from
[00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:06.560]   Epictetus and he basically is trying to sum up like two words that function as
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:13.560]   your advice for life these are two words that you should always follow and
[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:18.360]   observe and he says it's persist and resist and so some things you're
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:22.480]   resisting and then some things you're pushing through and doing and I like
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:28.280]   that sort of tension and to me it actually kind of does go back to the
[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:33.520]   the origins of the idea of of temperance or self-discipline there's kind of a
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:38.160]   contradiction there it's this sort of paradox of like do some things don't do
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:45.080]   some things and you've got to know what which is what and when right and so do
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:50.400]   you think is the reason why you started with physical for approaching that
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:53.960]   whatever that that tension that dichotomy is physical the right entry
[00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:58.880]   way I mean because it's it's so clear you know yeah I'm exercising I'm
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:02.480]   whatever I whatever it is it's clear and so that is that meant to be
[00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:07.040]   foundational is that where people should start I think so I mean unless you're
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:10.480]   asking me a sort of an editorial question which it's too late for me to
[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:15.040]   change if I should have moved that the part two of the book to part one which I
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:22.080]   certainly thought about but no I do like I start so I start with the physical and
[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:26.520]   then I start with like just what time do you wake up in the morning or the idea
[00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:31.040]   of like starting the day sort of intentionally and deliberately I make a
[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:36.040]   case for waking up early but I do think you want to start with with something
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:41.680]   very simple very straightforward something very clear you know if I say
[00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:45.400]   like master your emotions well what does that actually look like and what does
[00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:51.800]   that mean that's a vaguer that's a vaguer command then like wake up early
[00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:56.120]   go to sleep you know try to get eight hours of sleep every night or you know
[00:17:56.120 --> 00:18:01.320]   don't eat fatty foods or exercise regularly right like I wanted to talk
[00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:05.920]   about something very concrete very clear very tangible not just because I think
[00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:11.040]   it's simple but I also think momentum or sorry I think discipline is it's a
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:16.320]   muscle so the more disciplined you are able to be in I don't even want to call
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:20.360]   them trivial but in the these sort of straightforward parts of your life I do
[00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:27.120]   think it is transferable or the muscle once built allows you to be more
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:32.880]   disciplined in other facets of your life right I was thinking about this because
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:38.480]   we did a question on the show I'm only two weeks ago where someone was asking
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:42.000]   about being more disciplined and of course the short answer was get Ryan's
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:48.800]   book but it wasn't out yet so the longer answer was I ended up stumbling on this
[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:54.200]   construction that that discipline is not it's not an adjective it's more an
[00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:59.160]   identity so instead of saying I'm going to I need to go apply discipline to this
[00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:02.600]   thing I'm doing it's an identity you build as I'm a disciplined person
[00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:06.160]   disciplined people are then able to actually go forward and do other things
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:12.000]   with discipline and if that is true then the obvious the physical the clear is
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.520]   probably a really good way into into identity building and the reason why I
[00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:18.960]   was thinking about this I want to get your take on this is there seems to be
[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:25.480]   in the last let's say five years a pretty powerful online community I guess
[00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:31.440]   we could call it built around discipline and I'm talking about Cam Haines whose
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:36.280]   book I just read or David Goggins or rich role you know it's really how rich
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:41.120]   role got started before before he shifted more guru etc these type of
[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:46.880]   characters who who demonstrate extreme physical typically that's right
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:50.480]   discipline and it's very popular is very popular and so what's going on is it
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:55.800]   what's this tapping into why is this so popular well I let's say a monk is
[00:19:55.800 --> 00:20:02.040]   equally impressive in terms of their dis let's let's say to be a monk you know
[00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:06.960]   you take your vow of poverty you detach from society where your robes you shave
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:11.400]   your head etc you meditate multiple hours a day let's let's let's stipulate
[00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:16.800]   an environment in which that demands as much discipline as running an ultra
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:22.880]   marathon perhaps more well one is much more cinematic than the other right one
[00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:28.120]   is much more followable than the other so I do think that's why you see sort of
[00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:34.760]   the feats of strength or the the sort of physical fitness influencers the sort of
[00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:39.400]   discipline manifesting itself whether it's hunting or running or lifting
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:43.600]   weights or what time you wake up this is easier to track and watch so I think
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:50.000]   there's some just sort of filter bias there but I do think it goes back to the
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:55.200]   idea that it is a transferable skill and you you want to build you want to build
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:59.720]   it up and and you know this is why the Stokes would talk about taking cold
[00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:04.280]   baths or you know wearing coarse clothing they were trying to build up a
[00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:09.160]   kind of a toughness right Seneca Seneca talks about treating the body
[00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:13.440]   rigorously so that it's not disobedient to the mind right like if you're the
[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:18.000]   kind of person that can say when your body is tired and you're in the middle
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:23.440]   of a run and your body saying you should stop doing this it is hard and you have
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:27.920]   the ability to override that I think that is a skill that then when your
[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:33.280]   phone says hey you should pick me up and tune out the world for the next 45
[00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:39.400]   minutes ideally you have cultivated again the ability to be like no I decide
[00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:45.880]   what I'm gonna do not the impulse not the urge etc and to go to go to your
[00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:49.200]   point about discipline being an identity I think it's an identity but I would also
[00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:53.400]   argue that it is a habit and this goes back to Aristotle he says like if you
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:58.600]   want to be a jet if you want the virtue of say generosity he says you get that
[00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:03.880]   by being generous right this isn't like a state that you arrive at it is a thing
[00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:10.600]   that you do and so again if you want to be more disciplined it starts by being
[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:16.400]   disciplined and insisting on discipline and making discipline a habit so you
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:19.600]   know what are you gonna quit what are you gonna push yourself to do persist
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:25.440]   and resist this is how one develops the identity of discipline I don't think
[00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:32.680]   it's something you assert just like call calling yourself a writer is not as
[00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:41.240]   important as regularly writing we've already talked about that before yes
[00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:46.680]   yeah yeah I have the pen I mean I think that all makes sense right like it's
[00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:51.120]   it's tractable to get 10% more disciplined than you were before for
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:55.240]   example as a tractable goal so if you start by being as disciplined as you can
[00:22:55.240 --> 00:23:01.240]   you can then be six months later 20% more disciplined than six months later
[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:05.240]   20% more disciplined than that I mean you that's tractable increasing by a
[00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:09.320]   modest amount whereas jumping from you know I'm out of shape I'm on my phone
[00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:14.320]   all the time I'm gonna be elk hunting you know marathon elk hunting or
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:19.000]   whatever for six days next week it's not gonna happen which it by the way I think
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:23.280]   this is I don't know what your take is on this but you know I know various
[00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:27.200]   people who have been involved in we could think of as like manhood or
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:33.360]   manliness style online communities where yeah they're into it was you know was
[00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:37.240]   weightlifting I think after Rogan's influence definitely into bow hunting
[00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:40.040]   like everyone's bow yeah right so they're working out their bow hunting
[00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:45.280]   and I think it's easy for people around here like suburban DC to kind of roll
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:49.000]   their eyes and like oh come on what is this what do you think you are caveman
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.040]   yeah something like this but what I'm observing and what I hear from the
[00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:57.680]   people who run these communities is yeah you get in the door hunting because you
[00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:02.040]   saw cam Haines do it on like the Rogan podcast and lifting out because Jaco
[00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:07.120]   yes does it but what you then get six months down the line is also now they're
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:10.000]   drinking less also now they're showing up more for their kids also now they're
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.160]   you know a better father is like this the the pornography is gone it was this
[00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:18.600]   this entryway it's like entry entry drug to to greater discipline you got to
[00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:21.840]   start somewhere and as you say it's cinematic I can have a drone shot of me
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:25.760]   trail run well you know what's funny about it too is like there is a certain
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:29.360]   amount of fattishness to it it's like you can as you just said you can trace
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:34.880]   it like exactly to what influencer popularized what activity but it's not
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:41.160]   like they're it's some fad that came out of nowhere like they invented it's not
[00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:46.240]   like pickleball which wasn't a game you know even just a few years ago right
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:51.560]   like it is these are timeless activities you could say they're timeless
[00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:57.040]   disciplines right like bow hunting it taps into something immensely primal
[00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:02.160]   about the human experience hunting being outdoors you know sort of getting the
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:08.360]   endorphins from exerting oneself like the Brazilian Brazilian jiu-jitsu which
[00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:14.240]   a lot of people do these are these are traits activities that would not only
[00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:19.520]   have not been unfamiliar but were in fact practiced by Marcus Aurelius and
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:23.560]   Epictetus and Seneca and like they talk about these things not in the
[00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:29.200]   metaphorical sense but in the real sense when Marcus really says you know you
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:35.280]   know you should face life like a like a wrestler dug in for sudden attacks like
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:40.320]   he's saying that as a person who trains in the discipline of wrestling and had
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:44.520]   his whole life so I I think there is something you know when you look at our
[00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:50.640]   very modern sheltered sort of unchallenging lives there's something
[00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:57.760]   refreshing and invigorating about these activities like I just again kind of a
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:03.080]   fad I just got like a cold plunge at my house and you know there's there's some
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:05.600]   part of me that feels a little ridiculous because it's like everyone's
[00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:09.520]   doing it and who actually knows what the health benefits are like they're there I
[00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:14.440]   think they're there but they're not like I would I would not be shocked to find
[00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:20.560]   they were overstated but like in a world where you have hot water on demand at
[00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:27.480]   all times a certain softness comes from that and the ability to do uncomfortable
[00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:33.640]   challenging things on purpose and subject yourself to it it toughens you
[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:38.320]   up and then when you know the hot water isn't there because you're staying in a
[00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:43.880]   hostel in Europe while you're traveling or something you you have a layer of
[00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:48.520]   resiliency or discipline there that a person who gets everything they want all
[00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:54.000]   the time doesn't have right I mean this is what I always used to think about my
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:00.080]   parents like my dad for example way less affected by hardship than I think we
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:04.080]   were I would be at my current age like oh you got to wake up early to pick
[00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:07.400]   someone up at the airport at 5 a.m. or this is inconvenience like whatever like
[00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:10.760]   just do the thing you need to do and and my long theory had always been well he
[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:15.560]   had the you know right after college Vietnam was going on and yeah the leave
[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:20.320]   college and be in Louisiana at an army base you know sleeping on tarps and
[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:25.480]   crawling through the through the jungle and when that type of stuff happens later
[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:31.080]   in life you say whatever I'll wake up at 4 to pick you up like being tired for a
[00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:35.360]   day is not though it's not the worst thing so let me put on a put on the
[00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:38.300]   lens of I'm one of my listeners they write about this fun a lot to me what
[00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:42.000]   we'll try to extract some they write me about this one a lot so try to extract
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.560]   some some reasonable advice so where do you tell someone to start if I'm
[00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:52.040]   calling in saying Ryan I watch those videos they resonate I watch you know
[00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:55.200]   discipline videos I know I want this in my life I know I'm missing and I'm all
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:28:01.320]   over the place what do I do tomorrow yeah I guess it would depend on where
[00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:06.400]   that person is I don't mean like that's interesting geographically but I mean
[00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:09.920]   like where are you in your life right are you a hundred and fifty pounds
[00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:15.080]   overweight I might say let's start with a walk right if you're in pretty decent
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:20.080]   shape I might say let's start with the run right like so I do think it depends
[00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:24.520]   like if I walked into your office and it was a disaster I might say let's start
[00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:30.920]   by cleaning up your desk right if you were someone who was over committed and
[00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:37.280]   and overbooked I might say well let's start by eliminating one thing from your
[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:42.160]   to-do list each day not doing it right but like what is a task that we're gonna
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:47.440]   delegate or outsource or eliminate from your purview so you know what do you
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:50.720]   know what I'm saying like I think some people the discipline is you've got to
[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:55.360]   get off your butt and start moving and then someone else I was just reading
[00:28:55.360 --> 00:29:01.280]   about Tom Brady like Tom Brady had to have the discipline to start taking one
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:06.400]   day off a week right like so so those are very opposite ends of the spectrum
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:11.840]   right here's a person whose discipline has taken them incredibly far but
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:17.360]   perhaps endangered or jeopardized other things that they're they really care
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:21.720]   about and then you have another person who doesn't have the life they want
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:27.120]   haven't hasn't realized the potential they they have and so they need to start
[00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:31.040]   small and build and so I guess maybe the first thing we want to look at is like
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:35.520]   are you a person who you don't have enough discipline or are you a person
[00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:42.760]   who is perhaps too driven too active too busy I would I probably personally lean
[00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:46.480]   more towards that end of the spectrum and so when I have thought about
[00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:51.520]   discipline it's been more like I'll give you an example I'm working on this book
[00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:58.000]   now and trying to say hey how can I do this book at the level that I want to do
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:05.560]   it but do it more sustainably do it not not not hate the process so much but do
[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:09.440]   it more enjoyably at the same time and so I think it really depends on where
[00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:14.720]   you are on that spectrum oh interesting okay so so let me give you a specific
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:18.560]   scenario I'll give you two all right so so scenario number one because I hear
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:26.040]   this one a lot 23 out of school has a job is you know like I don't know maybe
[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:29.920]   it's what I want to do maybe I don't doesn't have any real serious hobbies
[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:32.960]   but sort of just out there in the world on their phone playing a little bit too
[00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:37.360]   much video games and they're in there early early in life like okay foundation
[00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:41.120]   lane time I'm feeling type a I don't know what to do with my energy I have
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:44.840]   ambition I have no target well start with that scenario maybe that's an easy
[00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:50.480]   one yeah so I think this goes to the the question that you talk about in your
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:53.360]   books which is like I want to do something great but I don't know what
[00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:58.080]   that is and you just said it have a number of vague sort of passions or
[00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:03.960]   interests well I think I think what I would do in that position is sort of
[00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:08.200]   first off where do I have time that I'm wasting right and video you've mentioned
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:11.120]   video games so it's like okay I'm gonna make this decision instead of video
[00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:18.360]   games I'm going to read or instead of video games I'm going to volunteer or
[00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:23.400]   attend this class or well I think what that person to me is really needing it's
[00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:32.360]   not more discipline per se but exposure to or an avenue to go down that begins
[00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:38.040]   to direct that energy and effort towards something constructive or positive right
[00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:42.320]   like for me the pivotal moment in my life my development of as a writer and I
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:47.480]   was in that position where I sort of like talented interested wanted to do
[00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:52.520]   something that wasn't you know it's sort of a normal nine-to-five job and I I end
[00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:56.320]   up starting to write for my college newspaper and this college newspaper
[00:31:56.320 --> 00:32:00.480]   introduces me to a number of people allows me to develop my skills and and
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:06.000]   thus puts in motion that thing so let's say I was out of school well you know
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.440]   maybe this is an email to someone that you admire that you want to you know do
[00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:15.320]   so you want to intern for maybe this is you know committing to some sort of
[00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:19.440]   charity project or some sort of group activity or I think you you've got to
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:23.520]   find something that you're directing this towards and it it might turn out
[00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:26.280]   that you don't like that thing as much as you think you do and you end up going
[00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:30.400]   in another direction but you've got to stop this sort of idea of like I'm just
[00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:35.440]   sitting around and that task or that thing is going to reveal itself to me
[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:39.080]   that's not how it's gonna go interesting I mean so you're saying you need a
[00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:44.000]   target for disciplined energy discipline can apply in a vacuum again just okay
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.600]   I'm disciplined today you need to have things that you're directing your
[00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:50.680]   attention towards that seem valuable but then that's something now that you can
[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:54.280]   you can okay pursue all right so then here's the harder scenario I guess is
[00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:57.080]   like you and I and you mentioned this before but like think about you and I
[00:32:57.080 --> 00:33:03.520]   are in a similar situation we're writers that has sort of spun out into sort of
[00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:08.280]   media companies we have you have the painted porch bookstore I have my
[00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:14.240]   academic career we we have a lot going on our issue is not laziness but our
[00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:19.240]   issue might be lack of lack of hitting potential in one particular area
[00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:24.000]   because of crowdedness so how do how do you and I think about discipline as
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.440]   people who do a lot we're not short on accomplishment but maybe you're doing
[00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:34.920]   too much I think you met less need the GM of the Rams right I don't know if I
[00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:39.640]   connected you guys anyway see the GM of the Rams and I went and I spoke to them
[00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:43.840]   maybe two three years ago and he he was sort of going over with me like the
[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:48.480]   rules of the organization and one of the rules of the organization is the main
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:53.080]   thing is to keep the main thing the main thing which I love I just love I love
[00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:58.960]   that phrase and so I think for people like you and me as you have multiple
[00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:04.000]   things you're good at multiple things that produce revenue multiple things
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:10.640]   that produce rewards of all kinds you know it's it's it can be difficult to
[00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:17.480]   recall or remember or prioritize what the main thing is and so for me I've I
[00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:22.720]   like to do lots of things I have lots of interests but I have to sort I the
[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:27.160]   discipline for me is the reminder of like what is the thing that drives all
[00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:33.120]   the other things what is the thing that only I can do right and so that's the
[00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:39.600]   actual writing of the books and the ideas right and so I've had that were
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:43.880]   you do you focus that your answer that question is just books I would you say
[00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:47.360]   it's podcast other things like someone else can't host your show but is it just
[00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:51.280]   books how do you answer it well it's someone else can't host the show but if
[00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:57.240]   I want to do the podcast then it's gonna mean organizationally or system wise I
[00:34:57.240 --> 00:35:04.200]   have to set up systems so the podcast takes as little time as possible right
[00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:07.920]   so it's like I have to hire a producer I have to hire a scheduler I have to hire
[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:12.320]   this is one of the reasons that we were talking about this earlier why I did a
[00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:18.160]   deal with a network like I want to limit the imposition of that thing as much as
[00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:24.080]   possible so that it does not impede on the main thing which is me sitting down
[00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:29.080]   and writing but then also even that like okay what is a research assistant cost
[00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:33.440]   right what are the what's an office that I need to set up I just I just think
[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:39.080]   about like how how do the decisions I make the schedule I have the priorities
[00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:45.720]   I have how are at the end of the day they facilitating the main driving thing
[00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:53.200]   and and I can't really compromise on that do you have a rule in terms of
[00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:57.880]   timing for writing is it this is what gets the time first it's it's this many
[00:35:57.880 --> 00:36:03.320]   hours it's the first mornings yeah I'll give you a good example of me not not
[00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:07.800]   falling being able to fulfill it completely so last week because of
[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:15.280]   publicity for the book and because I had three different talks I had one full
[00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:24.280]   morning to write and I missed like five out of seven bedtimes or something like
[00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:28.680]   that right so like for my two main things which would be writing and family
[00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:35.520]   I I agreed to things that took me away from those main things and that's not
[00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:39.360]   how I want my life to be I also as an adult understand sometimes you're
[00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:44.440]   temporarily out of balance and you know it but I could I remember what I was
[00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:47.960]   thinking about as it was happening was how easily this could become the norm
[00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:53.440]   and how I'm going to have to be even more disciplined as fees go up as
[00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:59.960]   opportunities increase as asks increase that I don't allow that week to be the
[00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:05.000]   norm the week the norm has to be this week which is that I have written every
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.200]   morning and done every bedtime so it's it's really about I think it begins
[00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:13.900]   ironically you talked about the the sort of two different ends like a someone
[00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:17.560]   just starting and someone who's in it at the core it's like what it what are you
[00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:21.040]   trying to do what is the what is the important thing what's the target you're
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:26.640]   aiming at because if you don't know that it's really hard to be disciplined right
[00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:31.080]   well I mean how do you figure out this is insider baseball yeah but there's
[00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:36.160]   this this weird tension in both of our worlds between the writing is the main
[00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:40.000]   thing right that that's the core of our our success and the thing that can't be
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:47.080]   replicated the the online media the podcast etc really supports the writing
[00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:52.840]   in the sense of it it's what you know it's what allows stillness or courage to
[00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:56.920]   hit number one it's what allows the publishers will keep giving us money to
[00:37:56.920 --> 00:38:01.080]   write books or what have you and so then it's this weird tension and I haven't
[00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:04.120]   quite been able to figure that out so on the one hand I'm like the the online
[00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:07.720]   media company piece of it needs to be contained but it's very important
[00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:10.680]   because that's what will allow you to keep doing the books but there's this
[00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:14.320]   other counterfactual of what if you said no I'm just going straight care Robert
[00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:18.160]   Caro mode or McCullum only I'm just gonna think and write and put out the
[00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:21.880]   best books and some will sell better than others and I don't know what
[00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:26.440]   happened that counterfactual you I think that yeah I I think the key to being
[00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:31.800]   Robert Caro is to be born 90 years ago right like that's the key part of that
[00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:37.240]   strategy right like he comes from another like he has been putting out
[00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:42.920]   books since 1970 right he has a 50-year or I guess a 40-year head start on us so
[00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:46.760]   that is it it came out in a different environment it came out of a certain
[00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:52.680]   kind of scarcity it's like like if you want to be Steve McQueen like you're
[00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:55.640]   gonna have to find a different way to be Steve McQueen because the way Steve
[00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:59.680]   McQueen was Steve McQueen was from a different media environment right so I
[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:05.040]   think understanding that some of the the just like people want to go back to
[00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:08.960]   living in the 19 you know America in the 1950s like that's not gonna happen right
[00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:15.480]   like fundamentally things have changed for the better right but one of the
[00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:19.760]   things I am sort of heartened by and it highlights the tension you're talking
[00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:25.080]   about which is like the number of people that I hear now that tell me they heard
[00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:30.360]   about me from YouTube is like probably it's probably the dominant way that I
[00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:33.800]   hear from people now or that people discover the work now what you're not
[00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:39.040]   just we're not subscribers now there it's high now right it's like 750,000
[00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:43.040]   something like that and it wasn't long ago that it was a hundred I remember
[00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:48.360]   thousand yeah it was very low yes it's been it grew very very fast and that is
[00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:54.840]   the power of the algorithms and you know the immense size of those
[00:39:54.840 --> 00:40:00.600]   platforms so I understand that people are not walking through bookstores and
[00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:05.680]   randomly discovering authors for the most part that's that's a reality so so
[00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:09.080]   yes if you want the work to resonate and reach people you have to have these
[00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:13.800]   online tools or you have to access these different platforms it's just thinking
[00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:19.280]   about it in a way that you know the mask doesn't eat the face so to speak right
[00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:25.520]   like that that you don't it here's here's the weird thing YouTube is easier
[00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:31.120]   than writing right like the I've worked on a couple of books for people where we
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:34.600]   tried to take a YouTube channel and turn it into a book or a podcast and turn it
[00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:38.760]   into a book now you might think this would be really easy it's actually quite
[00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:44.400]   hard because the visual side of the medium does most of the work like if you
[00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:49.120]   think about like what a dramatic drone shot to go to the rituals and the Cameron
[00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:54.800]   Haynes of the world a dramatic drone shot in an exotic location you know
[00:40:54.800 --> 00:41:02.720]   inspirational music and you know a voiceover right that paints a scene that
[00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:10.680]   is extraordinarily difficult to do in just words and so I see people more
[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:15.880]   often than not start with writing which is a tough medium and then get seduced
[00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:23.320]   by or stolen away from these other mediums and what gets relegated or
[00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:28.920]   abandoned is the hard day to day miss of sitting down in front of a blank page so
[00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:33.560]   I have tried to set up systems where I take advantage of the platforms and I
[00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:39.040]   benefit from them and I'm I'm agnostic as to what medium the message is getting
[00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:45.520]   out but as an artist or a creator what I love is the craft of the writing and
[00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:51.000]   that's the thing that I feel like I am world-class at so I want to be
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:57.440]   uncompromising on my protection of that space and that skill I mean I think that
[00:41:57.440 --> 00:42:01.960]   all is right I was I was thinking you know the other day that why don't
[00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:05.960]   fiction writers have this issue if you think about well-known fiction writers
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:13.080]   for the most part do not have large online platforms John Grisham does two
[00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:18.680]   weeks of publicity once a year when his book comes out he semi famously when his
[00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:23.320]   assistant retired didn't bother to hire a new one because he said no one has my
[00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:26.880]   number only my editor has my number you know yeah but on the other hand when I'm
[00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:31.720]   thinking about fiction it it looks like yeah but it's incredibly more narrow the
[00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:35.520]   past to actually being successful there so either you're a Grisham or a king or
[00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:39.520]   you're selected for a book club and so that's probably the price we pay to be
[00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:44.800]   nonfiction writers is we don't have the option that fiction writers have of I
[00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:48.280]   disappear and right I really don't do anything else except for the two weeks
[00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:52.040]   of publicity when my book comes out we don't have that option but many more of
[00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:56.400]   us I guess can make a living at this than fiction writers I mean you know the
[00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:59.520]   I think that's better but yeah I think that's right I wouldn't I wouldn't say
[00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:04.240]   that that nonfiction is more a meritocracy than fiction but I would say
[00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:10.760]   that the individual has more agency in nonfiction so like and I don't want to
[00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:14.280]   dismiss the the fiction authors who have been successful and say that it's luck
[00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:19.280]   but I would say that it is a industry in which breaking through is a side of
[00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:24.960]   publishing in which breaking through requires more gatekeepers more breaks
[00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:33.800]   going your way and more sort of institutional support or I feel like an
[00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:39.800]   interesting self-help author with a somewhat new or you know a unique
[00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:45.160]   message has a reasonable chance of breaking through getting a toehold and
[00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:52.920]   like developing an audience whereas like the the fiction world is littered with
[00:43:52.920 --> 00:44:00.600]   talented potentially brilliant authors or creators who their books sell 66
[00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:05.880]   copies and they'll they'll they'll never get in front of an audience and there's
[00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:09.840]   really no and it's it's not because they're not working hard enough it's
[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:14.920]   because there isn't the pathways that you're talking about to do that like for
[00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:20.040]   you and I like we write a book and then we can go make videos about the same
[00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:24.840]   ideas in that book and those videos can reach people in and thus sell the book
[00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:31.080]   if I wrote a sci-fi book about you know some planet in another solar system and
[00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:36.040]   it's this complex universe interesting characters it's a whole world it could
[00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:40.440]   be brilliantly done but I can't make videos about a world that nobody knows
[00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:45.440]   about and nobody cares about to draw attention to a book that nobody knows
[00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:50.960]   about and nobody cares about whereas me making videos about self-discipline you
[00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:54.720]   know there are people who are looking for help with self-discipline who then
[00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:59.600]   in watching the video might read the book and that that I I do think you want
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:04.480]   to as you seek out career paths obviously there's callings and you can't
[00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:10.120]   ignore a calling but I think you want to go towards places where you have agency
[00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:15.680]   it's like do you want to be the 50th Mexican restaurant in your town that's
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:19.600]   gonna be a hard way to break through and so when I think about what I'm doing I
[00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:26.960]   try to think like you know is is success here in my power or not right so so
[00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:31.680]   nonfiction right not meritocracy but many more paths many more paths to to
[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:35.880]   non-trivial sales than fiction but you would almost say look if you want to be
[00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:41.840]   a fiction writer to face face the reality of this is how the gatekeepers
[00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:44.200]   work this is their credentialing that works if you want to be a literary
[00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:47.920]   novelist and be like well I have to have these proximate goals first of getting
[00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:53.920]   to the Iowa workshop or having an editorial position at in plus one or at
[00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:57.600]   Harper's I mean that's that's where you would need to be to get through the
[00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:01.160]   gatekeepers and and it's a world where you can't just say I want the world to
[00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:04.840]   be the way I want it to be so I want to just write my brilliant novel during
[00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:08.840]   National Novel Writing Month and and it break through you have to say oh here's
[00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:12.960]   the hurdles I have to get through and if I'm not making those hurdles then it's
[00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:16.160]   probably not going to work out where we're nonfiction writing right we do
[00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:20.040]   have we do it we do have more paths I mean I don't know what I hear from
[00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:23.040]   novelists you say like their their agents or their editors are really
[00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:25.920]   pushing them to be on social media and they don't want to be distracted they
[00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:28.600]   don't know what to do and and I don't really know how to answer because in my
[00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:32.440]   mind is like I don't think it's gonna matter either way right right they're
[00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:35.720]   just giving you general advice because they don't really there are no
[00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:39.240]   publishers gonna be like hey it's inherently a crapshoot let's hope that
[00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:43.480]   the gatekeepers you know anoint you it's funny because you know you talk about
[00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:47.760]   you know be so good they can't ignore you I I don't think anyone means that in
[00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:52.160]   the sense of like just make something amazing and then the world will beat a
[00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:58.360]   path to your door as Emerson said it's it's also figuring out in like who is
[00:46:58.360 --> 00:47:04.160]   the they so you know so good they can't ignore you who is it and then what is it
[00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:08.680]   that they want to see and how do you get in front of them you have to have the
[00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:12.580]   ability to break down that world like it's like if you wanted to run for
[00:47:12.580 --> 00:47:18.460]   office okay what are the qualifications I don't mean like can you do the job
[00:47:18.460 --> 00:47:22.360]   because we all know that's not really a qualification these days but like front
[00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:26.280]   what are what are the filtering mechanisms what are the gatekeepers and
[00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:31.600]   what do you need to bring to them to stand out or to distinguish yourself
[00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:38.080]   from other people so they can't ignore you it's not simply just being what you
[00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:42.520]   think you want to be and knowing that that has something to offer the world
[00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:49.800]   you have to figure out the peculiar logic or you know roadmap of the thing
[00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:55.720]   you're trying to break through that that that is what's so key about it right you
[00:47:55.720 --> 00:48:01.080]   have to find find your entryway which is hard and it might take experimentation
[00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:05.280]   and you see this pattern a lot when something clicks and it might not be the
[00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:09.240]   first three things you try then being willing to do the battering ram model
[00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:14.940]   hey this is working now we have to smash through that that opening we have to put
[00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:19.440]   all of our energy we have to run with it so no when something is working you have
[00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:22.480]   to run with it I would this is the advice I was giving to a young writer
[00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:27.840]   the other day is I was saying it's two things it's a it's the search and
[00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:32.480]   exploration and exploitation it's hard to tell like what's the package of the
[00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:35.960]   what you're talking about who you are how you're presenting it that's going to
[00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:41.040]   catch and so you the thing you try might not work but when you do find something
[00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:46.000]   that catches then it's the exploitation part you have to then really with
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:50.400]   discipline pursue that and so let me ask you about that as long as we're getting
[00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:53.960]   sort of insider baseball down there needs and all the other metaphors here
[00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:58.160]   you're very good at that and and you know I've known your work forever I mean
[00:48:58.160 --> 00:49:01.800]   I remember I don't know if I knew you specifically but we had friends in
[00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:06.280]   common back then probably probably through Ferris I remember when word got
[00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:11.760]   around that Ryan holiday the marketer the author of hello online is going to
[00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:16.120]   write a book about stoicism and I remember having that conversations with
[00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:18.280]   someone thinking you were going to write a text but I don't know what you were
[00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:22.400]   doing but like this is never going to work and I don't know how that's an
[00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:24.960]   interesting story to get into but at some point I don't think was right away
[00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:29.080]   that's what I want to ask you about at some point when you realize bringing
[00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:34.960]   this particular philosophy alive was was clicking you yeah really got focused so
[00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:41.040]   the daily stoic became a brand it became a focus it became a structure you you
[00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:44.760]   had a format that people could anticipate for the book so maybe walk us
[00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:49.600]   through how your exploration exploitation story when it came to kind
[00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:54.720]   of coming across this and then how you disciplined and diligently built up this
[00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:59.120]   like really powerful Empire around it well I knew I wanted to write about
[00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:03.200]   stoicism that's what I was interested in that's what I was excited about that's
[00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:07.560]   the style of writing I liked but I also understood that you know people were not
[00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:14.540]   lining up to give book deals to you know at that time like 23 24 year old college
[00:50:14.540 --> 00:50:21.520]   dropouts who had not even studied philosophy right and so I knew that to
[00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:26.840]   break into publishing I probably had to do something else first to then have a
[00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:30.200]   little bit of leverage or power to transition towards what I wanted to write
[00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:34.600]   about and so I said you know what are my strengths and my strengths were I was a
[00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:39.960]   marketer and I had I had seen a lot of stuff I had interesting opinions about
[00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:43.960]   how marketing work and I had a lot of connections and a track record as a
[00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:48.120]   marketer so my first book was about media and marketing I did I like an
[00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:52.600]   e-book in between there but then the next book was this book about so
[00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:56.600]   philosophy and even then I was thinking look I want to really nerd out about
[00:50:56.600 --> 00:51:00.640]   philosophy but that is not what the audience wants but the audience wants
[00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:05.800]   is something to help them be better at what they do to solve their problems so
[00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:11.120]   the obstacle is the way you know the word stoicism appears like maybe once or
[00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:16.560]   twice in the entire book that is a book about overcoming obstacles I happen to
[00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:21.280]   be using and basing it on stoic philosophy but that is not what the book
[00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:30.080]   is explicitly about and that's for a good reason and so I what I was really
[00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:34.640]   doing was getting more and more power more and more leverage more and more
[00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:40.680]   control over an audience as I went and then got closer and closer to what I
[00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:47.840]   wanted the daily stoic happened to be a breakthrough both platform wise but also
[00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:54.320]   like process wise because it was a page a day in the book but then I started the
[00:51:54.320 --> 00:52:00.040]   email list which was also a page a day and the ability to just have somewhere
[00:52:00.040 --> 00:52:04.560]   to direct that energy something to be very disciplined about that was like
[00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:09.480]   huge for me well that's a good case study too for people or think about
[00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:13.680]   exploration versus exploitation is that for years and years and you still have
[00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:17.160]   it today it's one of my favorite newsletters you have this very high
[00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:21.440]   quality newsletter the reading list and I recommend that everyone sign up for
[00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:26.200]   that I guess at Ryan holiday net and it's where you would share what you read
[00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:30.480]   each month which is like a great concept it's on brand for you as someone who
[00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:34.180]   reads a lot and you sort of lives this intellectual life and but I watched it
[00:52:34.180 --> 00:52:38.960]   sort of slowly grow towards you know a hundred thousand people or whatever it
[00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:44.160]   was over years over years and when the daily stoic idea came out after a year
[00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:47.040]   that thing was it was a hundred thousand three hundred thousand six hundred
[00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:50.800]   thousand and and to me that really encapsulate there's there's there's two
[00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:55.200]   things that play I mean just having a really good idea isn't necessarily going
[00:52:55.200 --> 00:53:00.840]   to explode it's the the right idea push there's some concept of sort of feeling
[00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:04.760]   out what's working what's working with with my audience and then same thing
[00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:09.480]   with your YouTube page it's built around the daily stoic not around like it was
[00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:12.760]   before Ryan holiday and there's something if there's a clarity in that
[00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:16.560]   that works for people and it's hard to predict in advance what structure is
[00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:21.160]   going to work with people but but when they do I mean you pushed on those with
[00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:24.280]   a lot of effort once they were working so to me that's a really valuable case
[00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:29.720]   study that I'm studying when thinking it comes down to your network really and if
[00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:32.680]   you think about like let's say you really love investing you you trade
[00:53:32.680 --> 00:53:36.680]   stocks on the side you're building up this small portfolio you know you're
[00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:41.520]   you're learning and then you know one day you want to strike out on your own
[00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:46.120]   right it can't be the moment that you strike out on your own that you're like
[00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:50.160]   oh I should meet people who might be interested in investing you know in my
[00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:54.960]   fund that you have to be doing these two things simultaneously which is you have
[00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:59.520]   to be developing your competence and your skill and your confidence but you
[00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:08.120]   also have to be developing a network of colleagues of patrons of you know
[00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:12.440]   resources of potential investors etc and then it's there's a moment where you
[00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:17.960]   transition you you call you call all those chips in and so for me like the
[00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:24.360]   the daily stoic was as you said like I had written about so philosophy I had an
[00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:28.720]   online audience etc and then I wanted to launch this daily newsletter but that
[00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:32.840]   newsletter didn't start at zero right that that newsletter I emailed the
[00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:37.960]   hundred or so thousand subscribers to daily to the to the reading list email
[00:54:37.960 --> 00:54:40.920]   maybe it's 50 I don't know where it was at that time but let's say it's in the
[00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:45.920]   high five figures low six figures I told them about the daily stoic the day that
[00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:52.320]   it launched and I believe we started the daily stoic in let's call it September
[00:54:52.320 --> 00:55:00.760]   of 2016 with roughly 10,000 people right so that 10,000 is now about 500,000 and
[00:55:00.760 --> 00:55:05.160]   you know it's like almost 2 million on Instagram it's almost a million on
[00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:09.720]   YouTube it's different on different platforms but I wasn't starting at zero
[00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:16.040]   I was starting with a large number of which a percentage were interested in
[00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:22.080]   betting on me on this thing and that was enough to jumpstart that process so you
[00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:26.960]   have to you you can't just be developing the so good they can't ignore you thing
[00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:30.680]   that we're talking about you can't just be developing the discipline of how to
[00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:35.640]   do it you also have to be cultivating the resources in the relationship and
[00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:39.600]   the audience and the platform that you're gonna need to support you when
[00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:43.880]   you go do that thing right but there's a discipline to the idea
[00:55:43.880 --> 00:55:52.440]   yes daily stoic I want to be more I want more stoicism in my life I like Ryan
[00:55:52.440 --> 00:55:57.960]   holidays writing about stoicism if I got an email about this every day it would
[00:55:57.960 --> 00:56:01.800]   help me accomplish the goal of remembering to be more stoic in my
[00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:06.040]   everyday life so that there's a the properly disciplined idea so what I'm
[00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:09.280]   doing now is basically taking the concept of your book and stretching it
[00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:15.320]   in the places that is inappropriate but I just a plain idea yeah I would just
[00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:20.080]   say but the the actual discipline of the daily stoic the real beneficiary of it
[00:56:20.080 --> 00:56:26.800]   is me like the having to make a thing every day and I have for four years
[00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:33.880]   wait no six years so that's basically a free book every year that I that I write
[00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:40.800]   that process and then doing the videos about it and doing the the daily podcast
[00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:46.440]   version of it like my game has exponentially improved as a result of
[00:56:46.440 --> 00:56:51.680]   the forcing function of the output or the thing that I signed up for so like
[00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:56.520]   you know the discipline like one of the one of the great stoic lines is
[00:56:56.520 --> 00:57:02.480]   well-being is realized by small steps but it's no small thing I have gotten so
[00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:05.840]   much better I think one of the problems with writing compared to a lot of
[00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:09.120]   professions it's probably maybe it's similar to like being a movie director
[00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:15.400]   is that you only get so many reps like I've written more books than most people
[00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:21.080]   and even I only have like a dozen at bats right like that's it's hard to be
[00:57:21.080 --> 00:57:25.760]   great at something when you only get to do it so many times yeah you're doing
[00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:30.840]   the little pieces of it but you're not like actually getting the stage time the
[00:57:30.840 --> 00:57:35.840]   way a comedian would or an investor would or a you know a leader would
[00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:40.800]   you're not getting like the day-to-dayness of it and so I I have
[00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:46.640]   very much benefited from the function or the process of like having to be
[00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:51.160]   disciplined about making this thing all the time well those reps was the exact
[00:57:51.160 --> 00:57:55.920]   word a friend of mine who's a magazine editor former magazine editor when I was
[00:57:55.920 --> 00:57:59.760]   first deciding whether I was going to sign my first contract with the New
[00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:04.360]   Yorker and I was like well it's going to be a lot of writing to do that was
[00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:08.040]   exactly his terminology is no no you need to do that and actually put a
[00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:11.760]   pretty big word count in the contract because it's reps like yes and that was
[00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:16.760]   the way he conceptualized the the advantage of of that writing setup is
[00:58:16.760 --> 00:58:21.080]   you're going to get reps to editing it has to be at a high level or you know
[00:58:21.080 --> 00:58:24.320]   they're not even going to sniff it and you can do it again and again and again
[00:58:24.320 --> 00:58:28.240]   then when I was deciding should I do a column for four or five months where it
[00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:31.960]   was every twice a month again it was all about reps so yeah I hear you on that
[00:58:31.960 --> 00:58:37.240]   is and then you're doing you're doing the work again and again yeah so that's
[00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:42.080]   interesting well sorry audience to write like from an audience yeah the the the
[00:58:42.080 --> 00:58:47.560]   tightrope of like if it doesn't work like you know very quickly whether it's
[00:58:47.560 --> 00:58:50.880]   not working or not and that that makes you better because you have to be alive
[00:58:50.880 --> 00:58:54.720]   and alert to it yeah so it's interesting so we're getting some nuances here
[00:58:54.720 --> 00:58:59.120]   around different applications of discipline so like an idea being
[00:58:59.120 --> 00:59:03.640]   disciplined meaning that it's it's very clear but then the discipline as a means
[00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:07.800]   of actual career development it means of reps as a means of actually you know
[00:59:07.800 --> 00:59:13.320]   building out skills there's a lot that comes out of this so I know we're
[00:59:13.320 --> 00:59:16.760]   getting short on time so I know you have a another interview coming out but I
[00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:20.920]   would be remiss if I did it on a podcast we talk a lot about the deep life and
[00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:25.200]   making radical decisions to affirm things that are really valuable to you
[00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:30.120]   you have to tell us about you're in what year one year in or one and a half years
[00:59:30.120 --> 00:59:35.000]   into owning your own bookstore which yes to me as a writer is very romantic so so
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:40.000]   are you going to fan the flames of my romance here or crash crash think down
[00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:42.120]   the reality I don't know which way you're gonna go with this but tell us
[00:59:42.120 --> 00:59:47.760]   about being a writer who now owns their own small-town bookstore I I love every
[00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:53.240]   every part of it so I will I will perpetuate the the romanticism of it I
[00:59:53.240 --> 00:59:59.000]   have no regrets so far but that that may well be because it's it's gone well so
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:02.400]   far I mean it was certainly difficult the pandemic made it more expensive take
[01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:07.040]   longer the elements have not been particularly cooperative we had to you
[01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:10.280]   know spend a bunch of money putting on a new roof and new ACs and all sorts of
[01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:20.920]   stuff but I would say the bookstore as a home base HQ sort of multi-use space has
[01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:26.320]   been one of the best not even decisions but investments I've ever made in myself
[01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:31.400]   and I think it's helped me up my game across the board so I guess I'm not
[01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:37.560]   saying everyone should open a bookstore but like in a world where everyone tends
[01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:43.840]   to default to doing digital things at scale I've actually really liked having
[01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:51.200]   something physical tangible rooted in a place that is my base of operations for
[01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:56.760]   for all the stuff that I do I would say the the if if I am trying to in effort
[01:00:56.760 --> 01:01:03.720]   of full disclosure the hardest thing has been actually the success of it you know
[01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:07.640]   people come from like all over and they they want to see me and so I kind of
[01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:12.040]   have to like hide out a little bit like it's not the the first year and a half
[01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:16.000]   from the pandemic was wonderful because it was like I had this huge space and
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:21.800]   then I had a reason why it was empty and now you know like even my wife because
[01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:25.800]   it's in this small town you know my wife will come to work and she'll be like I
[01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:30.080]   didn't get anything done because like everyone kept coming to say hi to me not
[01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:35.960]   like fans just like people who live here and so having to be disciplined and set
[01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:41.200]   boundaries has been you know one of the the lessons that I've been learning you
[01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:44.680]   know the last couple months for sure
[01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:53.200]   that we love you the rain oh sorry sorry what was the last right at you are right
[01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:58.680]   at saying having to set boundaries oh yeah so so having to set boundaries and
[01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:04.040]   be disciplined about you know protecting personal space protecting workspace like
[01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:10.800]   protecting like the bubble so to speak for both of us has been a challenge that
[01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:16.200]   I think we're getting better as a result of having to do and and that's that's
[01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:21.320]   part of being you know public in your work but it's also just like somebody
[01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:24.920]   working at an office right now has to be like look I can't say hi to you every
[01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:27.680]   time I walk to go fill up my water bottle like I'm never gonna get anything
[01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:31.680]   done so what are you say home base so what are the different activities is it
[01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:35.040]   is it writing podcasting videoing like when you says your home base for
[01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:38.640]   everything you're doing what what happens there yeah I mean my it's my
[01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:43.600]   office where I write it's where all the employees that work at my company have
[01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:49.000]   office have offices in it's right down the street from my house so like it's
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:53.440]   you know when it's where I get packages delivered or you know it's it's like
[01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:58.880]   it's the HQ which was helpful also you know I think we may have talked about
[01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:03.600]   this last time but like getting this stuff out of my house has also helped me
[01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:09.640]   be more have better boundaries at home right so like I'm not coming home from
[01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:15.160]   work and then getting lost in work because work is here and home is here
[01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:23.040]   and and so I just I think that there's something there's a reason that you know
[01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:26.680]   you don't want your desk to be in your bedroom you don't you want to separate
[01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:30.640]   these things yeah well I mean we talked about this last time but I definitely
[01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:35.560]   blame you for the HQ where I work because again it was you early pandemic
[01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:40.720]   yeah see me photos I was like man you have a place to go yeah and and even
[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:45.080]   pandemic aside like you have a place to go that's not your not your house and
[01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:51.080]   yeah you corrupted but it's been great I love this notion it has worked for me
[01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:55.640]   you know my producer Jesse who's here will tell you we're only now because it's
[01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:58.880]   post pandemic more people are coming through only now really doing the
[01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:04.080]   serious renovation we should have done a year ago but every church painted we've
[01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:07.800]   re we're re hanging things you know professionally this afternoon Jesse and
[01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:12.920]   I are building tables that should be fun and it feels on the one hand it feels
[01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:18.280]   like a huge indulgence yes on the other hand it feels like what a necessary
[01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:23.800]   investment for this particular type of life I mean yeah you you invest and I
[01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:27.760]   think the podcast helped me segment things financially because I just think
[01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:31.480]   oh I'm just taking ad money from the podcast and reinvesting it into the
[01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:34.440]   space right through the podcast so it can be sort of conceptualized it doesn't
[01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:38.440]   feel like I'm taking money out of the you know kids college fund or something
[01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:42.200]   like this and so that that is helpful but but that was yeah that was your
[01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:46.440]   influence and I think that's been that's been great so place matters is basically
[01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:52.040]   the lesson there yeah the experience the place matters for your work yeah it's
[01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:58.960]   like a vibe or a headspace that you get into and I think it just it creates some
[01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:05.200]   separation that's required also to be balanced into it to have to have
[01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:09.400]   boundaries too so like like for instance like if I was walking down the street
[01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:13.000]   and someone said recognized me and said hello I'd be like hello but when when
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:18.400]   someone comes to the office and tries you know they're like hey is Ryan here
[01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:22.720]   can I see them I actually don't feel bad saying like you know passing a message
[01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:27.720]   no I can't because like I'm at work right like I'm working this is where I
[01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:32.360]   go to work it's not a it's I've hung out here before but it's not a hangout space
[01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:39.760]   right and so the ability to sort of know what each thing is for I also think is
[01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:45.440]   sort of a function of discipline yeah exactly I mean having the formal location
[01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:48.640]   having the formal address having the formal office and people's expectations
[01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:53.160]   yeah expectations are different well Ryan I think we're at the we're at the
[01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:57.600]   top of the the hour so it's promised we'll wrap it up but but this has been a
[01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:04.480]   pleasure as always so the book is discipline is destiny I'm gonna I'm
[01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:07.640]   gonna list the places I tell people to go for you and you tell me what I'm
[01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:15.200]   missing okay so okay so you have the daily stoic newsletter which is very
[01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:19.360]   popular you get the email every day with this touch of stoicism to keep things
[01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:25.000]   going and that's daily stoic net dot-com dot-com there we go dot-com there's a
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:30.640]   daily stoic podcast where it's a daily most days a short podcast and then you
[01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:35.440]   have interviews once or twice a week that are longer fantastic podcast
[01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:40.560]   YouTube is daily stoic and there you have videos it's Ryan against like the
[01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:44.760]   email but visual you get the videos pushing on different parts of stoicism a
[01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:51.240]   lot of aspirational views of your ranch of your bookstore and then there's a
[01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:54.200]   whole mess of social media that you know you can all ignore do I have that about
[01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:58.000]   right is that yeah you know you're so sure though I do point you by the way is
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:02.280]   my example of social media done right I mean you you post things on there it's a
[01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:07.640]   good way to reach people but you're not on there battling with people you're not
[01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:10.920]   on your phone trying to see what your mentions I always point to your Twitter
[01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:14.160]   page when authors ask me what they should do on Twitter I was like do what
[01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:18.600]   Ryan is doing it's very clear it's a stoic quote it's once a day it works
[01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:25.440]   well with how people use Twitter and he doesn't have to be in battles with you
[01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:30.920]   know QA of all the networks the one to personally spend the least amount of
[01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:35.120]   time on it's definitely Twitter yeah yeah it's the one that's the one that
[01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:38.600]   will break your brain yeah Twitter will break your brain Instagram will just
[01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:43.280]   melt your brain into like not very useful I'm just watching these videos
[01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:47.680]   yes but Twitter is going to make your make you feel like the apocalypse is
[01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:50.240]   here you need to fight someone or you're about to die I mean Twitter has a
[01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:53.760]   dynamic I love your Twitter approach which is I don't even know if you even
[01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:57.760]   touch it I mean it's just these quotes I imagine you have a document somewhere
[01:07:57.760 --> 01:08:01.360]   with these quotes and there's someone who's putting them out there and I love
[01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:04.560]   to imagine all the people who are angrily I don't know the terminology for
[01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:08.000]   Twitter but you know replying like well Ryan blah blah blah and then like so
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.020]   yes I like yeah when he sees that that's really gonna get him and then when they
[01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:14.560]   realize you never see it I get a little bit of joy out of that no even like I've
[01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:17.760]   been doing Twitter threads recently where I'll like I'll take an article or
[01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:21.720]   an idea and I'll try to break it down into like a 20 tweet thread like I write
[01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:26.160]   that in in Google Docs I never see Twitter you know I don't even upload it
[01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:31.280]   into the thing that then posted on Twitter because it's a toxic cesspool
[01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:35.160]   that you should spend as little time as possible and but if people are there I'm
[01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:40.400]   happy to deliver up some ideas yeah just follow Ryan get me Ryan's yeah once a
[01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:46.560]   inspiring quotes and and and never ever just as able to send button yes or
[01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:48.720]   whatever I don't know the buttons I don't know how it works people have
[01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:51.520]   learned them don't look at me for advice about social media all right well Ryan
[01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:54.560]   thank you very much this is this is great I know the books going to be the
[01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:59.640]   monster my audience loves this topic so appreciate it as always and we'll talk
[01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:03.160]   again soon thanks man all right and that was my
[01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:10.280]   conversation with Ryan holiday I'm back here now with Jesse we're gonna talk
[01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:15.360]   about some of our main takeaways from that interview before we do let me first
[01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:22.320]   mention another sponsor that I am excited about and that is notion this
[01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:26.960]   ad almost seems superfluous because I know there's so many hardcore
[01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:31.160]   productivity practitioners of my audience that no notion and love notion
[01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:34.040]   so they already will know what I'm talking about here but for those who
[01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:41.960]   don't if you have any interest in building better smarter systems in your
[01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:45.960]   workplace or in your personal life to organize your work to get things done in
[01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:50.520]   a way that avoids messiness and unnecessary distraction you have to know
[01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:56.080]   about notion now formally we can call it an all-in-one and I'm reading their text
[01:09:56.080 --> 01:10:00.160]   here all-in-one team collaboration tool that combines note-taking document
[01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:03.840]   sharing wikis project management and more in the one space that simple
[01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:07.720]   powerful and beautifully designed informally it's like a productivity
[01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:12.520]   nerds dream sandbox it's a shared online interface where yeah you can capture
[01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:16.320]   notes and connect notes and build things like wikis but you can also build these
[01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:22.080]   custom templates and interfaces for specific processes that you have for
[01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:26.440]   yourself or for your organization here is checklist that go here here's a
[01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:30.920]   calendar events that come over here we assign these tasks over here you can
[01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:34.720]   build almost anything you want in the system that's going to help you keep
[01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:40.560]   track of information and organize your efforts with other people now you know a
[01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:44.960]   big believer in this it's one of the key ideas in my book a world without email
[01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:49.160]   that the way to get away from a world in which we're drowning in constant back
[01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:54.400]   and forth messaging is to build bespoke processes for what we do again and get
[01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:57.840]   in the office where we figure out in advance where does the information go
[01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:01.560]   when do we talk about it how do we talk about it notion is going to be one of
[01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:08.520]   your most effective tools for actually accomplishing that goal so you can do
[01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:14.280]   many things with these workplaces such as workplace OCRs or organizing major
[01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:17.960]   life events there is a worldwide network of millions of users already who are
[01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:22.520]   creating these custom templates and tutorials for notion so you can borrow
[01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:26.360]   what they're already doing to build even more advanced interfaces or
[01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:31.840]   functionality in to notion it'll make you more efficient and productive at
[01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:35.280]   work but what really sets notion apart is that it also seamlessly transitions
[01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:40.200]   from a workplace power tool into a game changer for your personal life I know
[01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:46.480]   many people who use notion for fitness tracking organizing a hobby keeping up
[01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:50.400]   with what they're reading a place to capture a collection of this is a
[01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:55.760]   specific example I have in mind now clips video clips and notes on movies
[01:11:55.760 --> 01:12:01.160]   that people are studying you can do almost anything again it is the ultimate
[01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:06.960]   sandbox for the productivity aficionado so you can get started for free at
[01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:13.560]   notion.com that's notion.com to start today for free that's notion.com to take
[01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:20.240]   the first step towards an organized productive work and life today all right
[01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:26.000]   I also want to mention our longtime sponsor my body tutor if you want to get
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:32.600]   in better shape the key element you need is accountability someone who not only
[01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:35.320]   gives you the right information oh here's how you should eat here's the
[01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:38.360]   workout that makes the most sense for you but actually ask you every day how
[01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:43.760]   did it go where are you struggling did you do the workout today did you do the
[01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:46.560]   diet they was there an issue with your eating today what's going on maybe this
[01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:49.440]   is not realistic what we planned it's that back-and-forth accountability that
[01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:54.720]   makes a difference now if you're training for a Marvel movie the studio
[01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:58.660]   will send someone to come live at your house and do all of this for you but if
[01:12:58.660 --> 01:13:03.080]   you're anyone else you can use my body tutor the idea here is that you get that
[01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:08.240]   type of coaching but it is on line so it's not nearly as expensive as having
[01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:13.000]   an actual dietitian or trainer there's a simple app you get that you use to
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:16.280]   interact with your coach every day you check in on what you ate you check in on
[01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:22.720]   how you move they give you feedback it's a simple idea but it works very well so
[01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:29.240]   if you're serious about getting fit go to my body tutor calm and if you
[01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:33.800]   mentioned deep questions when you sign up you'll get $50 off your first month
[01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:39.920]   all right so that's my body tutor comm t-u-t-o-r comm mentioned deep questions
[01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:45.860]   when you sign up and you will get $50 off your first month all right Jesse
[01:13:45.860 --> 01:13:49.520]   that was our first videotaped interview we just did I think it was a great
[01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:53.960]   conversation we've had Ryan on the show before it's been a minute since since
[01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:58.520]   we've had them so it's good to catch up I'm curious about your main takeaways
[01:13:58.520 --> 01:14:05.600]   I would say one of the things I really picked up out of this interview was this
[01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:13.480]   I have two ideas but first this notion of discipline needs a target so like if
[01:14:13.480 --> 01:14:17.440]   you want to be more disciplined what you actually first need is activities that
[01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:22.720]   you care about which can then be the target or receptacle for the discipline
[01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:24.800]   that you're going to build up so you need the right things to become
[01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:28.560]   disciplined about at first that that made a lot of sense to me also what made
[01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:32.760]   a lot of sense was this idea that discipline is cumulative that it is a
[01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:37.800]   reasonable goal to say I want to be 20% more disciplined than I am right now but
[01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:41.000]   it's not a reasonable goal to say I want to be David Goggins next month and so
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:46.200]   getting started somewhere reaching a certain level then moving to the next
[01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:49.680]   level to move to the next level that's how you work your way up to be a very
[01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:55.480]   disciplined person not just going from from zero to 60 yeah I don't think it
[01:14:55.480 --> 01:15:00.960]   really ever ends either I think it just keeps on going you know yeah and I think
[01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:05.160]   it's also interesting that we we ended up discussing for a while a notion of
[01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:09.320]   discipline that was actually about doing less and I don't know if that's just
[01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:11.920]   unique to me and Ryan I think it's probably not I think there's a lot of
[01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:15.840]   people in a similar situation but you Ryan and Tom Brady baby me Ryan and Tom
[01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:20.640]   Brady who was mentioned also in the interview we all share many things the
[01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:26.880]   three of us including needing to be disciplined about not doing too much and
[01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:30.280]   focusing on the things that matter I mean between the three of us it's not
[01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:33.520]   that we haven't been successful between the three of us we have like what six
[01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:38.880]   Super Bowl rings seven seven yeah so between me Ryan holiday and Tom Brady
[01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:44.240]   seven Super Bowl rings I don't know how many league MVP so you know we know what
[01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:49.360]   we're talking about - I think - league MVPs you know that he's got a 30 million
[01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:53.440]   dollar year for an ouncer after he stops playing did you know that is it really
[01:15:53.440 --> 01:16:00.000]   yeah he's making bank what's he what was his a Tampa Bay he always takes a little
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:04.960]   bit less so he's probably making 40 this year I would think right so he's gonna
[01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:10.640]   have to cut back his life Roger signed one for 50 he's so he's making bank - I
[01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:14.200]   think he's the highest right now so Brady okay so Brady's got to cut back
[01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:18.320]   his lifestyle is what you're saying when he becomes an announcer exactly you go
[01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:22.520]   from 40 to 30 million between here's what I'll just say I mean between me
[01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:27.080]   Ryan holiday and Tom Brady we're averaging more than 40 million dollars a
[01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:31.080]   year salary right now so like we know something something's going on between
[01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:34.840]   the three of us we have over 30 million dollars worth of media contracts next
[01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:39.120]   year so again let's just use that as social proof but I thought that was
[01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:42.080]   interesting because you know Ryan and I have very similar trajectories he's a
[01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:46.000]   little younger than me but I got started writing a little younger so we we line
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:51.200]   up pretty well so we've gone through a lot of this together coming up in
[01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:57.000]   writing building out these other things around writing really desperately trying
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.520]   to make sure that the writing itself is protected because without it nothing
[01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:02.480]   else matters but also recognizing that without the other stuff you're gonna
[01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:06.160]   disappear as a writer it's a really hard tightrope and you guys have the same
[01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:11.600]   publisher right yeah yeah we both are portfolio which is an imprint at
[01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:17.120]   Penguins we're both portfolio writers yeah I had four things I wanted to kind
[01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:22.560]   of ask you about from the interview all right one is cold bass what do you do
[01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:25.120]   you take cold showers are you doing that you hear people talk about all the time
[01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:29.640]   yeah I know it's big now or like cold plunge and then like sauna cold punch
[01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:32.560]   sauna or just even cold shower some people do that if they don't have the
[01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:35.520]   access to the other facilities and stuff well you're more up on these type of
[01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:40.280]   things to me is any of this in your routine yet yeah I started taking cold
[01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:43.360]   showers but then I didn't really like it Gonzaga just got brand new weight room
[01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:49.400]   with new cold tubes plunges so I'm gonna start going on that well so from what I
[01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:53.720]   understand and from what I understand let me let me cite my sources here I have
[01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:59.880]   one source so I just coincidentally like the other day was reading my friend
[01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:04.440]   Steve Magnus who's been on the show before he's a Brad Stolberg's the co-host
[01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:09.840]   of growth EQ podcast together and he's a athletic he's a running coach and was a
[01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:14.640]   high-level runner he did a Twitter thread about cold plunges because
[01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:17.600]   they're so popular and basically the takeaway from his thread seemed to be
[01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:23.160]   okay the and Huberman he timed in on this thread was interesting data is
[01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:26.880]   accumulating but we still don't completely understand it Steve's best
[01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:35.280]   guess is yes there are some these various benefits exist they're probably
[01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:41.040]   no different than what you get from like any sort of exercise mm-hmm so there's
[01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:45.800]   like some so if you do both yeah like it but but it's probably not doing
[01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:49.240]   something special I know if you hear like Laird Hamilton talk about it I
[01:18:49.240 --> 01:18:55.760]   think Laird has really influenced like how Joe Rogan talks about it they have a
[01:18:55.760 --> 01:18:59.280]   lot of claims yeah I think where it's like a very specific reaction that's
[01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:03.560]   causing all this and and Steve was saying maybe but like the best evidence
[01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:06.440]   they have now it's probably like it does you know it releases some chemicals to
[01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:09.360]   feel good there is a stress response that that you know all these things are
[01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:12.680]   kind of positive but you get the same thing running for 20 minutes you get the
[01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:16.720]   same thing from doing your your workout probably a lot of it is psychological
[01:19:16.720 --> 01:19:21.920]   but I think Ryan was saying there's a discipline aspect to it yeah I like this
[01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:26.040]   line treating the body rigorously so that it's you're not disobeying your
[01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:29.280]   mind and that's where I think there's probably the big advantage yeah like
[01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:32.600]   you're like I do the sauna I do the cold plunge it's part of it's part of the
[01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:36.160]   identity of being a disciplined person like I am the type of person who takes
[01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:39.360]   care of takes care of my body's willing to do things that are that are
[01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:43.160]   uncomfortable or non-obvious they get some sort of benefit out of it there's
[01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:48.280]   probably a huge psychological mm-hmm to it we have no space my wife's interested
[01:19:48.280 --> 01:19:53.800]   in the idea of a sauna etc but yeah we don't have space at our house right the
[01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:57.200]   second thing that I thought was really interesting is when he was talking about
[01:19:57.200 --> 01:20:00.520]   the network and I would actually ask this follow-up question to you because
[01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:04.280]   you asked him a question about discipline for like a 23 year old you
[01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:11.280]   know that scenario yeah so how would you talk to the 23 year old about you know
[01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:14.920]   creating that discipline but also establishing a network yeah that was
[01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:19.160]   interesting right because he was saying it's really important when you make the
[01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:23.960]   when like he made us leap the daily stoic calm like what he was doing before
[01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:28.000]   it helped that he had an audience but he knew all these people he had all these
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:31.960]   contacts the the pull on that I think that's it that's an interesting point
[01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:35.760]   that you know part of what you want to do is you're coming up is accumulate
[01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:39.040]   people who are on your side or on your team and I think a lot of that honestly
[01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:45.560]   is deliver be a good person be an interesting person have integrity
[01:20:45.560 --> 01:20:52.040]   deliver to stuff you say you're going to deliver be organized like be be a man a
[01:20:52.040 --> 01:20:55.320]   character a woman of character basically people remember that and it's actually
[01:20:55.320 --> 01:20:59.800]   pretty rare like most people they can't help themselves there's you know I'm
[01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:02.880]   just hung up on this or I have to mention this or get upset at someone
[01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:06.360]   about this and there's all that type of stuff that comes out if you're in the 10%
[01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:09.880]   of people who is just very reasonable and is able to be upset about something
[01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:12.320]   without making a big deal about something who's able to approach a
[01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:16.600]   social situation from the context of like what's appropriate here gonna be
[01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:21.840]   most effective not like I feel upset about this I can't not mention it or I
[01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:25.880]   have to brag they need to know I did this thing because you know and it just
[01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:29.480]   comes across terribly so there's probably something about in your 20s
[01:21:29.480 --> 01:21:33.920]   being a person that people like to be around yeah like authentic with
[01:21:33.920 --> 01:21:38.320]   integrity deliver you don't drop the ball you just do good work people want
[01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:40.880]   to work with people like that it's one of the things I've learned about
[01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:46.840]   publishing by the way is like that makes a difference mm-hmm and editors can
[01:21:46.840 --> 01:21:49.280]   write in and see if this is actually true or not but I've heard this time and
[01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:54.280]   again if you're a writer or a musician definitely for athletes I've heard this
[01:21:54.280 --> 01:21:58.320]   being someone that people like to work with or be around actually does make a
[01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:01.880]   difference you know I mean you could again if you're great at something
[01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:06.320]   Stephen King is if he was a jerk people are still gonna publish his books but I
[01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:09.520]   do think it makes an epsilon difference then eventually over time your network
[01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:13.880]   gets bigger it's bigger yeah yeah be willing to pull from it the next
[01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:19.560]   takeaway is I loved how he mentioned the Rams GM and the NFL I'm just a huge NFL
[01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:23.760]   fan so I always loved hearing about I know did they won the Super Bowl last
[01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:28.580]   year right last year yeah so they've been in it twice with McVay so Ryan spoke to
[01:22:28.580 --> 01:22:33.360]   them like three years ago all right two years later they win the Super Bowl I
[01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:37.400]   don't want to say trade for Stafford that was a big deal so he he helped
[01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:42.160]   training for Stafford and Ryan Ryan's talk yeah I think I think those two I
[01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:47.480]   do this two things I was telling Jesse off off-air deep work is more popular I
[01:22:47.480 --> 01:22:51.920]   guess in the NBA than the NFL but I did have an opportunity that I was not able
[01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:55.360]   to take advantage of just because I wasn't around we're one of the assistant
[01:22:55.360 --> 01:22:59.620]   coaches of an NBA team that was here to play the Wizards in DC who liked my book
[01:22:59.620 --> 01:23:04.000]   was like hey could you just come over to the team hotel and like talk to them
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:07.000]   about deep work and I couldn't do it I wasn't there well I think it goes hand
[01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:12.160]   in hand I mean you have a lot of golfers who are fans of your show and I think
[01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:15.820]   that you know even when we've talked you've answered some of the questions
[01:23:15.820 --> 01:23:19.320]   about time blocking as an athlete I think it goes it's really important
[01:23:19.320 --> 01:23:23.400]   because I mean they have certain things mapped out for them in terms of practice
[01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:27.480]   and lifts and whatnot but then when they're outside of that realm there some
[01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:32.440]   of them can have a tendency to be lost and yeah I think it helps hearing your
[01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:36.560]   message I mean that's what types of scenarios that's what a Mickelson was
[01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:39.960]   saying or no who was it Mickle Roy actually yeah Mickle Roy's the Mac
[01:23:39.960 --> 01:23:46.840]   McElroy sorry Rory but he's the digital minimalism fan yeah yeah and he was
[01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:50.440]   saying it made a big difference yet the outside not just during the game but the
[01:23:50.440 --> 01:23:57.040]   outside of game yeah yeah Ryan was great about that Ryan definitely did more with
[01:23:57.040 --> 01:24:00.560]   professional sports teams and kind of got the word out more that he was doing
[01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:04.360]   things with professional sports team and I think that helped yeah definitely
[01:24:04.360 --> 01:24:07.720]   expand expand his message because a lot of those athletes they want to like
[01:24:07.720 --> 01:24:11.880]   learn you know they're very like motivated yeah and they want to learn
[01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:17.120]   about discipline to these are disciplined guys yeah so yeah and then
[01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:20.960]   the fourth takeaway I found was I really liked his line about knowing what each
[01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:26.200]   thing is for you know he was talking about the office and like distinguishing
[01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:32.200]   work from home and that sort of thing yeah well that that's why we have the HQ
[01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:37.680]   with him that theory of his have a space if you can afford it spend the money on
[01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:42.040]   it have a space that's for the work it's different than home and you know now I
[01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:47.560]   have three spaces because I I have a space for writing at the home and then
[01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:51.440]   here is all for business so that gives me actually a separation between writing
[01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:54.840]   and all the business around our media business to me that's really important I
[01:24:54.840 --> 01:25:01.880]   know Ryan writes at his HQ I write in our study at home that we kind of custom
[01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:07.300]   built to be centered on writing and then I come here for the business side of
[01:25:07.300 --> 01:25:10.400]   things yeah and the writing where I write at home is a room that's kind of
[01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:14.360]   you know so it's all each place has its own place I think it goes hand in hand
[01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:19.880]   with your concept of time blocking too because you say a lot of times go to
[01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:25.320]   different areas for different spaces so and that that's important you know like
[01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:29.040]   I I think I gave you this example how I just went to like a different area for
[01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:32.600]   like a one of my online Spanish classes like a couple weeks ago and it was like
[01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:36.240]   cool because then you get motivated you're in there then you leave and you're
[01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:40.680]   done yeah yeah yeah keep it keep this place is separate so I think that's cool
[01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:46.160]   that's definitely something he said before about his bookstore too is it's
[01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:50.480]   not a super profitable endeavor to run a bookstore so like if you want to become
[01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:54.040]   rich or this or that but I really think the way he thinks about that whole thing
[01:25:54.040 --> 01:25:58.880]   is he he has a building in which lots of things that is useful to his life
[01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:03.100]   happens they sell books he records podcast he writes he has his staff is
[01:26:03.100 --> 01:26:09.800]   there and the bookstore offsets some of the cost of that mm-hmm but it's but
[01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:14.120]   also he just loves that the main benefit I think he gets from the actual selling
[01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:17.140]   of the books it's just that he loves bookstores yeah and like I have a bunch
[01:26:17.140 --> 01:26:20.920]   of books in here and I can bring books to people and curated and I love that
[01:26:20.920 --> 01:26:24.520]   and I think the space of a bookstore is highly motivating and it was really
[01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:27.640]   interesting way to think about it so if you just were doing a dollar and cents
[01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:32.920]   analysis on painted porch as a source of income I'm sure in the Ryan Holiday
[01:26:32.920 --> 01:26:37.640]   Empire that's like yeah way down way down towards this down there with the
[01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:42.960]   mint Oh Mori coins or something like that but if you see it as the bookstore
[01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:48.480]   as the center of his professional existence and a home for all the
[01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:53.000]   existence then suddenly it makes a lot of sense mm-hmm you can make the
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:57.520]   Republic a bookstore and it already has a bar built into it we just this is the
[01:26:57.520 --> 01:27:01.080]   thing if only if we had a bigger podcast we talked about it before a big enough
[01:27:01.080 --> 01:27:05.800]   podcast to be able to take over that space that's what that's what we'd have
[01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:10.920]   to do it's a big bar for a bookstore we'd have to cut that in half yeah it's
[01:27:10.920 --> 01:27:14.920]   a big bar for a bookstore maybe a book bar like you just have this would be so
[01:27:14.920 --> 01:27:18.920]   non-profitable if you had like multiple people behind a bar to like to help
[01:27:18.920 --> 01:27:24.760]   curate book selections for you it's like the the opposite we do need a bookstore
[01:27:24.760 --> 01:27:27.680]   in Takoma Park so look if someone is looking to start a bookstore and needs a
[01:27:27.680 --> 01:27:32.560]   partner let me know I think we need one I just can't do that work on my own all
[01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:37.400]   right well we should probably wrap this up but uh there you have it Ryan holiday
[01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:41.280]   by his book or check out his book discipline is destiny if you're near
[01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:47.120]   boss drop Texas you guys stop in on the painted porch bookstore we will be back
