[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.480]   - Welcome back to the podcast.
[00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.840]   We have been doing this podcast for almost a decade now.
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.040]   And over those 10 years,
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.720]   there have been some moving pastoral moments
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.740]   throughout those episodes.
[00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.960]   I remember one from a long time ago.
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.260]   I looked it up.
[00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.940]   It's way back in episode 131,
[00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.320]   episode 131 in Oldie.
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.920]   There, Pastor John was talking about
[00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.440]   important Bible verses to memorize,
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.080]   ones that he's found particularly useful in serving others.
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.960]   One such text was Psalm 130, verse three.
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.000]   If you, O Lord, should mark iniquities,
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.720]   O Lord, who could stand?
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.200]   There, Pastor John testified,
[00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.460]   quote, how many times have I knelt down,
[00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.800]   put my arm on somebody who has just been broken
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.320]   over some sin that they have committed,
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.400]   and I have been able to just pray over them this text.
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.400]   Lord, if you would mark iniquities, who could stand?
[00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:13.600]   That's a moving picture of a word spoken pastorally.
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.800]   And that image and that text comes to my mind
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.660]   when I think of today's sermon clip,
[00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.680]   because there's a question over
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.120]   how do we approach God in the midst of our brokenness,
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.400]   particularly in the brokenness we experience
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.360]   over our own sins.
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.280]   This very question gets answered robustly
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.840]   in Nehemiah chapters nine and 10.
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.200]   God's people are in distress,
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.840]   distress caused by their own sins.
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.400]   They know it, and they know they deserve
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.640]   the distress itself.
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.000]   So how do we approach God now?
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.180]   Here's Pastor John to explain,
[00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.480]   looking at Nehemiah chapter nine.
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:55.480]   - Starting with verse six, to the end of verse 37,
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.560]   the Levites are praying.
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.920]   This chapter is a prayer.
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.440]   They're praying to the end of verse 37,
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.720]   and they're crying out to you, oh God.
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.200]   The word you, in reference to God,
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.200]   occurs 30 times in these verses.
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.840]   What did they do?
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.320]   What did they say?
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.320]   How did they deal with God in great distress?
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.240]   And that's what we wanna know.
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.200]   How did they do that?
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.200]   Before we ask further,
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.320]   let's get more specific about the distress,
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.000]   'cause this will clarify your situation.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.240]   'Cause there's some of you right now
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:50.240]   who are perhaps arguing with yourself,
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.400]   if not with me, what you're about to say
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.760]   is not gonna apply to me,
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.240]   'cause you don't understand how I got where I am.
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.000]   So let's just see whether that's true or not.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.460]   Back to verse 37.
[00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.360]   They're not just in distress.
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.360]   They are in a distress that they deserve to be in
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.200]   because of their sin.
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.160]   And they are in a distress that God himself
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.440]   put them in.
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.920]   So let's look at verse 37 to see that.
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.240]   The land, its rich yield
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.080]   that we're supposed to inherit as a promise.
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.440]   This land goes to the kings
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.800]   whom you set over us.
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:49.640]   The slave masters, you put them over us, God,
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.200]   because of our sins.
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.320]   In other words, the great distress that we are in,
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.400]   we deserve to be in.
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.720]   And not only do we deserve to be in,
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.960]   it's judgment sent from you.
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:11.400]   So now we get clarity for you on this.
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.380]   Some of you might be tempted to say,
[00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.000]   the rest of you in here,
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.480]   you can call upon God in your distress,
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.600]   but not me, because I sinned my way
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:25.900]   into the mess I'm in.
[00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.300]   And number two, God put me here
[00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.320]   as a discipline or a punishment.
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.400]   So the rest of you can go on about your merry way
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.160]   following this preacher and learn how to call upon God
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.160]   in your distress, because it just came upon you.
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.440]   It didn't just come upon me, I brought it on me.
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.800]   That's their situation.
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.720]   So if you're in that category,
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.240]   you dare not talk like that.
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.900]   Don't talk to God like that.
[00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.900]   Do not say to God, this text is not addressing my need
[00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.200]   'cause I sinned my way into the mess I'm in
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.680]   and you brought it on me.
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.720]   That's irrelevant, that's the point of this text.
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.840]   These people are in a distress they deserve to be in,
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.480]   God put them in.
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:23.480]   None of you may escape the good news of this text.
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:28.720]   You have no right to tell God
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.920]   he can't give you good news.
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:38.440]   Oh, how many people I have dealt with over the years
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:43.440]   who tried to tell God they are beyond good news.
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.480]   And I get upset with them
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.920]   because they are belittling the cross,
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:55.000]   diminishing the blood, crying down the mercy,
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.360]   exalting themselves in their self pity.
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:03.680]   I won't have it, neither in this room
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.800]   nor in the counseling chamber.
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:10.800]   Don't tell God that he can't give you good news
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.480]   because you've sinned your way into your misery
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:18.660]   and God himself brought you under his discipline.
[00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:21.480]   That's exactly their situation.
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:26.480]   So we're in this together and we want desperately to know,
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.600]   so how do you approach God now?
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:34.400]   How do you talk to God in that situation?
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.040]   'Cause that's what they're doing
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:41.040]   and I want to learn as best I can how they do it.
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.280]   So what do they do?
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.280]   It's astonishing what they do.
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.560]   They pray back to God
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:54.280]   the entire history of the Old Testament.
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.080]   This is the longest,
[00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.760]   maybe the right word is,
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:02.720]   this is the fullest retelling
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.400]   of the Old Testament in the Old Testament.
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:10.000]   So Jim Hamilton says in his new commentary,
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.820]   this is the fullest retelling of the Old Testament
[00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:17.560]   in a short space in the Old Testament.
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:18.840]   And it's a prayer.
[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:23.040]   So they're telling God what God did for a thousand years,
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.280]   more than a thousand.
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:29.600]   That's a remarkable way to approach God
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:34.600]   in a deserved God ordained distress.
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:41.000]   So verses six to 31,
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   they're telling the story of the Old Testament.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.480]   Why would they do that?
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:51.080]   Here's why.
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:56.080]   God does not exist so that we can enjoy Bible stories.
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:02.860]   Bible stories exist so that we can enjoy God.
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:08.560]   And they desperately, desperately need to know
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:12.360]   is our God the kind of God
[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:16.640]   in whom there's any possibility of enjoyment
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:21.640]   in our great distress, well-deserved, given by God.
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:26.440]   Any hope at all that there's a God in heaven
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:30.800]   that would give us hope that He could be enjoyed in this.
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.200]   That's what they need to know.
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:36.220]   And they know where to find the answer in the story
[00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:41.220]   'cause that's what the stories are for, to reveal God.
[00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:43.680]   And they desperately need to know
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:45.720]   what kind of God do we have?
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:47.560]   Is it over for us?
[00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:52.640]   Or is He the kind of God that perhaps
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:57.640]   there might be some hope in a deserved, God-given distress?
[00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:05.100]   That's why they're retelling the stories back to God.
[00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:12.060]   Verses six to 15, the Levites celebrate the power of God,
[00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:18.720]   the righteousness of God,
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:22.680]   and the covenant-keeping salvation of God.
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:27.680]   Verse six, "You are," all caps, "the Lord."
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:32.220]   And you know what that refers to.
[00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:35.040]   Yahweh, "You are," that's His personal name.
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:37.740]   It's like, "You are James."
[00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:39.560]   Well, it's not James, it's Yahweh.
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:41.960]   You are Yahweh, and you know where the name came from.
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:44.160]   Exodus chapter three, verse 14,
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.860]   "Tell them I am sent you.
[00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:49.040]   "I am who I am."
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:52.320]   And the name Yahweh built on I am who I am,
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:55.680]   which means every time you see big L-O-R-D,
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.760]   this is God saying, "I am God."
[00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:03.800]   And I have no competitors, and I depend on nobody,
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:08.800]   and nothing, I had no beginning, I will have no end.
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:12.360]   Deal with me, because that is reality.
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:16.740]   That's God, every time He says, "You'll know I'm the Lord,"
[00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:19.960]   so they begin, "You are Yahweh."
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.840]   It's a good place to begin.
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:24.320]   You are absolute God.
[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:28.640]   There's no negotiation going on here, at all.
[00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:30.800]   You don't negotiate with God.
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:33.020]   He is absolute reality.
[00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:37.680]   We are defined.
[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:40.040]   He is definer.
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:41.360]   We are dependent.
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:44.000]   He is totally independent.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.920]   Our being comes into being.
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:51.920]   His being has always been as inconceivable as that is,
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:55.240]   and how glorious.
[00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:56.520]   So we just begin here.
[00:10:56.520 --> 00:11:01.200]   This is a place of reverence, and humility, and lowliness.
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.680]   You begin your dealing with this God
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:05.240]   in your great distress.
[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:10.240]   You are Yahweh, the great, and only, and absolute God.
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:14.600]   Verse six in the middle.
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:18.260]   "You have made heaven, and heaven of heavens,
[00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:22.780]   "with all their hosts, the earth, and all that is on it,
[00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:25.600]   "the seas, and all that is in them,
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:29.920]   "and you preserve them all."
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:31.600]   So you made everything.
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.600]   You uphold everything.
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:37.040]   "Therefore, the hosts," I like the translation,
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:41.080]   "armies, the armies of heaven, worship you."
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:43.600]   You are exalted.
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:48.080]   Verse five, "Exalted above all blessing and praise."
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:50.560]   So that's where you begin, right?
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:53.480]   In dealing with God, just lift him up.
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:57.800]   Now remember, these are people who are totally guilty,
[00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:03.920]   under distress, given by God, okay?
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:06.400]   So you lift up your soul in your guilt,
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.880]   and you lift up your soul in your distress,
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:12.400]   and you lift up your soul under the mighty hand of God,
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.240]   and you say, "You are God."
[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:17.000]   That's a great place to begin.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:17.840]   - Yeah, amazing.
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:19.640]   Don't tell God that he can't give you good news
[00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:22.520]   because you've sinned your way into your misery.
[00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:24.040]   That's a great point from a sermon preached
[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:27.080]   on June 27th, 2014 at the Gospel Coalition
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:29.520]   Women's Conference in Orlando, Florida.
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:31.640]   It covered Nehemiah 9, verse one,
[00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:33.920]   all the way to Nehemiah 10, verse 39,
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:38.240]   and it is titled, "Responding to God According to His Word."
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:41.560]   If you have a great sermon clip for me, send me an email.
[00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:43.520]   Give me your name, hometown, the sermon title,
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:45.880]   and the timestamp of where the clip happens in the audio,
[00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:47.280]   and make a note of what stands out to you.
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:49.880]   Put the word clip in the subject line of an email
[00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:53.920]   and send it to me at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:58.120]   That's an email address, askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:04.280]   Well, do unbelievers get a second chance
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:07.300]   at salvation after death?
[00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:10.160]   It's a common question, very important one,
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:12.360]   one that means we need to look carefully
[00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:14.440]   at 1 Peter 3:19.
[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:15.400]   I'm your host, Tony Rehnke,
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:17.080]   and we are rejoined in studio with Pastor John
[00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:19.640]   when we return on Friday to look at that text,
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:21.880]   1 Peter 3:19.
[00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:22.840]   We'll see you then.
[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:25.420]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:28.000]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
