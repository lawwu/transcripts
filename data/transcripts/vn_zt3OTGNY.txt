[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.200]   the second epistle of Peter, the first chapter, and the fourth verse.
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:16.840]   The fourth verse in the first chapter of the second epistle of Peter, "Whereby given unto
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:25.200]   us exceeding great and precious promises, that by these ye might be partakers of the
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:31.840]   divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust."
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:37.680]   But let us remind ourselves of the connection of this statement with what has gone before.
[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:44.400]   Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, "To them that have obtained like
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:51.120]   precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ, grace
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.240]   and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:04.320]   According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.640]   through the knowledge of him that hath called us by his glory and virtue, whereby are given
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:18.840]   unto us exceeding great and precious promises, that by these ye might be partakers of the
[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.840]   divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust."
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.280]   Now, last Sunday morning we were looking at that phrase in the first verse, "Precious
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.440]   faith, like precious faith with us."
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.760]   And this morning I would like to call your attention to the precious and exceeding great
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:39.760]   promises.
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:48.440]   Now, I call attention to this as I was explaining last Sunday morning because it seems to me
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:54.800]   that here the apostle reminds us, as he reminded those first Christians to whom he was writing,
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:03.160]   of the things that are essential to our enjoyment of the Christian life.
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.320]   These people to whom the apostle writes were Christians.
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:12.880]   They were some of these first, these early Christians, but they were in difficulties,
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:13.880]   they were in trouble.
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.760]   It has never been an easy thing in this world to be a Christian.
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.160]   The world is against the Christian.
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.680]   In the world ye shall have tribulations, says our Lord just before the end of his life.
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.120]   In the world ye shall have tribulations.
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.240]   But you see, he does not leave it at that.
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.280]   He says, "Fear not, I have overcome the world."
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:42.320]   And this is what has been necessary, therefore, for Christian people at all times, to be reminded
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:49.080]   that provision has been made for them, that they can be more than conquerors through him
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.080]   that has loved them.
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.480]   We are not promised that there shall be no difficulties and trials.
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.680]   And it is always a confession of complete failure to understand the Christian life when
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.720]   people who are in trouble begin to grumble and to say, "Why should this happen to me?
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.720]   Why do the ungodly never have these troubles?
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.360]   Why must it always be happening to us?"
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:16.680]   That just betrays, I say, a fundamental failure to understand what is really quite basic in
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.800]   the whole of the Christian life.
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:25.840]   And it is entirely without excuse, because after all, most of these New Testament epistles
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.080]   were written in order to deal with that very situation.
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.360]   That is how they have ever come into being.
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:40.280]   They are addressed to believers, but to believers who, for various reasons, have got into trouble
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.600]   and have become a little bit dejected and discouraged and unhappy.
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.720]   They are all designed to deal with such a situation.
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.560]   And that is the very thing that the Apostle Peter does here.
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.840]   I was reminding you last Sunday morning that he says, "Now I have got nothing new to say
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:58.840]   to you.
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.400]   I am simply here to stir you up, to rouse you, to stimulate you, to lay hold upon the
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.280]   things you already know."
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.880]   That is all you need, is to be reminded of what you have already heard, what indeed you
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:12.880]   know.
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.680]   You are already established in this present truth, but the trouble is you are not reminding
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.920]   yourselves of it.
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:25.360]   You are allowing yourselves to revert to an old form of worldly, un-Christian thinking,
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.680]   and the result is you become depressed.
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:34.880]   Now his statement is that the antidote to all that is just, again, to remind themselves
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.440]   of who they are and what they are.
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:41.560]   And as we saw last Sunday morning, the first thing he gives them at once is that as Christians
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.960]   they have been given this gift of precious faith.
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.760]   And we looked at that and saw why faith is so precious.
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.720]   He gives us the reasons for that.
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.600]   It is precious in and of itself.
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:59.960]   It is precious because of that which it does for us, and above all because it links us
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.600]   to God and to our blessed Lord and Saviour.
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:09.360]   But you notice the apostle does not leave it at that.
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:16.160]   In a sense it can be said that the most precious thing of all about faith is that it leads
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:21.040]   us to know the promises of God.
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:27.120]   And so he goes on at once to say here in the fourth verse, "Whereby, by means of faith
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:39.320]   and everything that has been provided for us for life and godliness, whereby are given
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:46.920]   unto us exceeding great and precious promises."
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.960]   And he holds this before them.
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:56.040]   Well now you notice that he uses the same word again, this favorite word of his.
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:01.440]   Everything about this Christian life to the apostle Peter was precious, priceless, beyond
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.000]   any computation or any attempt at evaluation.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.640]   It is such a glorious, such a wonderful thing.
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:14.880]   And as he said that faith is precious, he says these promises are precious also.
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.400]   But he cannot leave it at that this time.
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.400]   He has got to add to it.
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.400]   It is because they are so wonderful.
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.280]   They are not only precious but they are exceeding great.
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:27.920]   Of course they are because they are precious but there is no end to them, he says, these
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:33.120]   exceeding great and precious promises.
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:37.880]   And what he is really saying in effect is this, that they have no right to be in the
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.640]   condition that they are.
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:44.840]   They have no right to be discouraged and apprehensive and troubled like this.
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.920]   He says where is your hold upon the promises?
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:51.800]   Where is your understanding of the promises?
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:56.800]   Don't you know, he says, that according to his divine power he has given unto us all
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:00.920]   things that pertain to life and godliness.
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:06.000]   There is nothing that you can ever need but that it is already provided for you.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.920]   Why don't you lay hold on these things, says the apostle, instead of merely looking at
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:16.000]   your circumstances and then beginning to faint and to falter and perhaps to grumble and to
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   complain.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.320]   Oh, he says, stop for a moment and look at the promises.
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.880]   Get the whole thing into perspective.
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:26.920]   Don't look at one side only, look at the other side.
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.240]   Take a complete view.
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:34.920]   Now this is in many ways the glorious thing about the Christian life, that it does enable
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:41.080]   us to take a whole view of life and all its attendant circumstances.
[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:46.440]   And above everything else that is important for us as Christian people is that we should
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:53.280]   know about these promises and never be holding on to them, or if you prefer it, resting upon
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:54.280]   them.
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:08:02.880]   So now let us approach this, and let us do so by my asking you a question.
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:05.280]   Are you living by the promises?
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:12.040]   Are the promises of God precious in your sight?
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:16.240]   Do you regard the promises of God this morning as the most important thing in your life,
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:18.160]   the most wonderful thing that you know?
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:22.280]   That's how it should be, says the apostle.
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:23.800]   We should live on the promises.
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:26.280]   We should regard them as precious.
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:31.540]   We should always be counting them, realizing how exceedingly great they are in number and
[00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:32.540]   in their character.
[00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:43.000]   And here I say, is the great question to us, are we thrilled by these promises of God?
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:49.200]   Are these the thing this morning that really make us what we are and make us especially
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.200]   more than conquerors?
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.000]   Well, now all the apostle says he's doing is this.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.160]   He says, "I just want to remind you of these things."
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:00.320]   He'd been given an intimation, obviously, that his death was not far distant.
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:03.720]   He'd been told something about the manner of his death, and tradition has it that he
[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:07.360]   was crucified upside down in a particularly painful manner.
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:10.560]   All this has been revealed to him, he says, but he says, "While I'm left here, while
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:15.840]   I'm still in this tabernacle, I'm going on to remind you of these things so that after
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:23.160]   my decease, you may always have these things in remembrance.
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:27.880]   And there is nothing more important for us this morning than the promises of God."
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:32.120]   Now, what does this mean?
[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:37.320]   I'm asking again, I'm putting it in an experimental and a very practical manner.
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:39.320]   Are these absolutely vital to us?
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.800]   Are they precious to us?
[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:47.200]   Do we say, "Well, I don't care if the world were to deprive me of everything and I found
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:54.000]   myself finally completely bereft, I'd still be happy, I'd still be triumphant, I would
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.800]   still have the promises of God."
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:01.080]   That's how we should be as Christian people.
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:02.960]   Who knows what we may have to face?
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:06.380]   Christian people have often had to face the loss of all things.
[00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:12.280]   These early Christians did, and Christians in other times of cruel persecution have had
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:13.280]   to face this.
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:18.880]   There are Christian people in various countries of the world today that are in this position,
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:23.600]   and yet you will find that throughout the running centuries, their testimony has been
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:29.440]   unanimous, it's been universal, and it has been to this effect, that when the world has
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:34.920]   done its worst and has robbed them of everything, it was then, perhaps, that they found the
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:42.720]   greatest moments of their happiness, because then they realized as never before, the exceeding
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:45.760]   great and precious promises of God.
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:49.440]   Well, now then, why does the apostle describe them like this?
[00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:50.720]   Well, let me put it like this.
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:56.960]   Let me say something general, first of all, about these promises.
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:04.600]   These were what the Jews, the children of Israel, regarded as, in one respect, their
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.560]   greatest possession of all.
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:14.440]   Do you remember how the apostle Paul, in writing to the Romans, gives us at the beginning of
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:23.640]   chapter 9 a list of the peculiar privileges of the Jews, the children of Israel?
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:24.640]   What were they?
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:26.740]   Well, this is how he puts it.
[00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:32.760]   He says, "I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ, for my brethren, my
[00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:39.040]   kinsmen, according to the flesh," listen, "who are Israelites, to whom pertaineth the
[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:46.040]   adoption and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law and the service of God
[00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:53.480]   and the promises, whose are the fathers, and of whom, as concerning the flesh, Christ came,
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:56.900]   who is over all God blessed forever."
[00:11:56.900 --> 00:12:03.640]   Now you notice that in the list he mentions particularly the promises, and of course,
[00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:08.840]   this was the thing which the Jews prized above everything else.
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:16.380]   Now, there is a sense in which it can be said that the Bible really is nothing but the kind
[00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:23.740]   of casket in which God has stored his promises.
[00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:27.020]   The Bible is the book of God's promises.
[00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:28.340]   What is this book?
[00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:34.980]   Well, it is the revelation of God's purpose of salvation and of redemption, his promises
[00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:38.000]   with respect to that.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.780]   That is the main function of the Bible.
[00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:43.560]   It is the history of salvation and redemption.
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:48.900]   It tells us what it is, how God purposed it, how he carries it out, what is going to happen.
[00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:53.380]   That is really the Bible, and all its history and everything else that you have in it, it
[00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:55.420]   is all incidental to that.
[00:12:55.420 --> 00:13:01.980]   So it can be described, as I say, as the kind of casket into which God has put his exceeding
[00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:04.300]   great and precious promises.
[00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:11.300]   So you start, you see, by reading Genesis 3.15, where God came down into the garden
[00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:17.940]   after the fall of Adam and Eve and gave them the first great promise.
[00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:22.380]   Having warned them that their life because of their sin and rebellion was now going to
[00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:27.940]   be one of strife and of turmoil, that there would be enmity between the seed of the woman
[00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:33.980]   and the seed of the serpent, he went on to say this, that the seed of the woman shall
[00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:36.860]   bruise the serpent's head.
[00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:43.220]   Now in a sense, that is a summary of all the exceeding great and precious promises.
[00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:45.300]   They're all there.
[00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:48.500]   They're all there in that one great promise.
[00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:54.420]   You divide them up, but they all really ultimately come to that.
[00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:59.900]   Now this, then, I say, is the great theme of the Bible.
[00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:05.140]   The next, perhaps great statement of this promise is to be found in God's dealings
[00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:06.140]   with Abraham.
[00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:08.740]   There are other incidental aspects of it.
[00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:13.180]   After the flood, God gave a promise that he'd never drown the world again.
[00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:16.260]   There would never be a universal flood anymore.
[00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.020]   That's a part of it, if you like.
[00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:24.740]   But the great statement again of the promise is that which is made to Abraham.
[00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:28.980]   So you will always find in the Scriptures that when they deal with this question of
[00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:33.580]   the promises of God, Abraham is always given prominence.
[00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:37.620]   And you remember how it was put to him.
[00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:41.660]   God called out Abraham from Ur of the Chaldees, and he dealt with him in a certain way.
[00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:48.660]   But then one great night came when God called Abraham out of his tent.
[00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:53.180]   And he said, "Now look up into the heavens and count the stars if you can.
[00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:57.740]   Or think," he said, "in imagination of the sand on the sea shore."
[00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:01.860]   Try to count the grains of sand upon the sea shore.
[00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:06.300]   Try to count the number of the stars in the heavens.
[00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:14.020]   He said, "Look here, in thee and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth of
[00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:16.700]   the world be blessed.
[00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:23.500]   You are going to bear a spiritual progeny that will be as great as the stars innumerable,
[00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:26.980]   or as the grains of sand upon the sea shore."
[00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:33.700]   Now there is this great statement to Abraham, and the most important statement it is.
[00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:37.900]   You will find that, well, there is a sense in which, as I say, you just don't understand
[00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:43.980]   the Bible at all unless you understand this teaching about the promises of God.
[00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:49.780]   You see, the whole trouble with the Jews at the time of our Lord and the apostles was
[00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:51.580]   that they got muddled about these promises.
[00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:53.180]   They got tied up with the law.
[00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:58.860]   So the apostle, for instance, in the third chapter of the epistle to the Galatians, he
[00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:01.580]   puts it like this, beginning at verse 16.
[00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:07.340]   Now he says, "To Abraham and his seed were the promises made.
[00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:13.980]   He saith not unto seeds as of many, but as of one, and to thy seed, which is Christ.
[00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:22.500]   And this I say, that the covenant that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law
[00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:28.260]   which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disavow, that it should make the promise
[00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:29.260]   of none effect.
[00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:33.140]   For if the inheritance be of law, it is no more of promise.
[00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:36.700]   But God gave it to Abraham by promise."
[00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:40.540]   And you get the same argument in the fourth chapter of the epistle to the Romans.
[00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:41.540]   What does it mean?
[00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:44.060]   Well, it means this.
[00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:48.240]   The thing that matters, argues the apostle, is the promise of God.
[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:53.700]   The promise given originally in the garden, the promise particularly repeated and ratified
[00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:56.020]   to Abraham.
[00:16:56.020 --> 00:17:00.460]   He says the law only came in four hundred and thirty years after that.
[00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:02.060]   It isn't the law that saves.
[00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:05.500]   That was the mistake of the Jews, that they thought by keeping the law they were going
[00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:06.500]   to save themselves.
[00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:07.500]   No, no.
[00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:11.060]   Salvation, he says, is by promise, it's by the grace of God.
[00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:12.620]   This is the thing to hold on to.
[00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:13.940]   The law is incidental.
[00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:16.020]   It comes in, it finishes.
[00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:20.620]   It's the grace, it's the promise, this is the continual thing.
[00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:26.180]   So you see, it is absolutely vital that we should be clear about this whole question
[00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:29.860]   of the promises.
[00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:32.980]   Let me put it like this to you.
[00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:40.100]   There is no question at all but that the thing that sustained the saints of the Old Testament
[00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:43.580]   was just this great question of the promises.
[00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:47.140]   You think of those great giants of the faith.
[00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:55.260]   Think of people like Abel and Enoch and Noah and Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and Moses
[00:17:55.260 --> 00:18:00.580]   and David, all these great heroes and giants of the faith.
[00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:01.580]   What made them the men they were?
[00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:06.620]   Take a man like Abraham, as I say, living in Ur of the Chaldeas.
[00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:10.700]   God comes to him and says, "Come out."
[00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:11.700]   He's got to leave everything.
[00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:12.700]   He's got to leave his family.
[00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:16.220]   He's got to leave his old traditions and surroundings.
[00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:19.060]   God called him and said, "Come out."
[00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:26.140]   The astounding thing is we are told that Abraham went, not knowing whether he went.
[00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:28.060]   Well, how did he do it?
[00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:29.060]   What made him do it?
[00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:30.060]   What enabled him to do it?
[00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:35.260]   Oh, the answer is he believed the promises of God.
[00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:40.060]   So you see, when you come to the great eleventh chapter of the epistle to the Hebrews, it's
[00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:44.580]   just a great exposition of this doctrine of the promises.
[00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:50.460]   Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen, for by it
[00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:53.400]   the elders obtained a good report.
[00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:56.620]   In other words, what he's saying is this.
[00:18:56.620 --> 00:19:01.420]   The faith of these people enabled them to believe and to hold on to the promises of
[00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:02.420]   God.
[00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:04.900]   So he puts it in two striking statements.
[00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:07.260]   Listen to the thirteenth verse.
[00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:17.020]   These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off
[00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:23.020]   and were persuaded of them and embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and
[00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:26.420]   pilgrims on the earth.
[00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:28.660]   You see, that's the thing that kept them going.
[00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:31.040]   God says, "Come out, leave all."
[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:36.260]   He says to Moses, "No, you're not to become the great leader of the Egyptians, though
[00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:39.220]   you've been brought up as the son of Pharaoh's daughter.
[00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:41.220]   No, no, you're to come out.
[00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:43.740]   You're to go out into a wilderness.
[00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:45.580]   You're to come out and do what I tell you."
[00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:46.740]   Why did he do it?
[00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:48.700]   Well, the answer is by faith.
[00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:54.500]   "Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter,
[00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:58.300]   choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures
[00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:02.380]   of sin for a season, esteeming the reproach of Christ."
[00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:08.220]   Greater riches, more precious than the treasures in Egypt.
[00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:09.220]   Why?
[00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:14.300]   Oh, he had respect and to the recompense of the reward.
[00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:17.500]   The promises of God, he held on to them.
[00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:19.340]   He was ready for anything and everything.
[00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:22.420]   The promises, it was the same with David.
[00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:25.980]   And listen to how this man goes on to say, "What shall I more say?
[00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:30.660]   The time would fail me to tell of Gideon and of Barak and of Samson and of Jephthah, of
[00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:35.980]   David also and Samuel and of the prophets, who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought
[00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:40.980]   righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the violence
[00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:45.980]   of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant
[00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:49.500]   in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.
[00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:52.020]   Women received their dead raised to life again.
[00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:57.820]   Others were tortured, not accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection.
[00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:03.860]   And others at trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover, of bonds and imprisonments,
[00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:08.980]   they were stern, they were sworn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword, they
[00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:14.820]   wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins, being destitute, afflicted, tormented, of
[00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:16.980]   whom the world was not worthy.
[00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:22.940]   They wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of the earth.
[00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:32.460]   And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, obtained not the promise, God
[00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:39.180]   having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.
[00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:44.220]   You see, they didn't receive the fulfillment of the promise, but they believed in them,
[00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:49.180]   they were ready to endure and to suffer all that, because they believed the promise of
[00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:50.180]   God.
[00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:56.860]   So, you see, it can be said quite rightly and truly, that the secret of all the great
[00:21:56.860 --> 00:22:02.060]   saints of the Old Testament was that they lived on the exceeding great and precious
[00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:04.480]   promises of God.
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:08.740]   They held on to them at all costs.
[00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:13.300]   Indeed, this thing is made abundantly clear in so many places.
[00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:19.620]   I'm trying to show you the centrality of this doctrine of the promises in the whole
[00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:22.140]   of the scriptures.
[00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:27.580]   What made the Jews the special people of God was, as I've reminded you in the quotation
[00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:34.060]   from Romans 9, that the promises were given to them, not to anybody else.
[00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:39.620]   And the truth, therefore, about the Gentiles is that they didn't have the promises.
[00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:46.540]   Listen to the Apostle Paul reminding the Ephesians of this in chapter 2, in verses 11 and 12.
[00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:53.260]   "Wherefore, remember," he says, "that you being in time past Gentiles in the flesh,
[00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:57.340]   who are called uncircumcisioned by that which is called the circumcision in the flesh made
[00:22:57.340 --> 00:23:06.700]   by heaven, that at that time, before your conversion, you were without Christ, being
[00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:15.980]   aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenant of promise, having
[00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:21.660]   no hope, and without God in the world."
[00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:26.780]   You see, that is the great distinction, if you like, between a Christian and a non-Christian.
[00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:27.780]   What's a Christian?
[00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:32.140]   Oh, a Christian is a man who believes in the promises of God.
[00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:33.140]   What's the non-Christian?
[00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:35.780]   He's a man who knows nothing about them.
[00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:38.900]   And you see, that's the tragedy of the world this morning.
[00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:43.060]   Men and women in the main in this country know nothing about the promises of God, and
[00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:46.580]   that is why they're without hope.
[00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:49.220]   They're without God, they're in the world.
[00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:54.100]   They have no hope whatsoever, so they have to try to buy themselves up by drinking and
[00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:57.940]   stimulating themselves with drugs and filling themselves with pleasure.
[00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:00.740]   They've got no promises to hold on to, and what do they see?
[00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:06.700]   Well, they see bombs being piled up, but they've no hope, they've no promises.
[00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:10.980]   The thing that differentiates the children of God from the children of this world is
[00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:16.300]   that the children of God have got promises, and they live by them.
[00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:22.820]   The others are strangers from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants
[00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:26.940]   of promise, having no hope and without God in the world.
[00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:31.460]   And you see, when a man becomes a Christian, this is what happens to him.
[00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:34.880]   He is brought in amongst the people who've got the promises.
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:39.180]   So the apostle at the end of that second chapter of Ephesians puts it like this, "You are
[00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:44.380]   now therefore no more strangers and foreigners, you are now fellow citizens of the saints
[00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:46.900]   and of the household of God."
[00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:50.660]   And then in the third chapter he puts it still more plainly.
[00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:53.660]   He says, "You know, my position is this.
[00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:59.940]   By revelation he made known unto me the mystery, which in other ages was not made known unto
[00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:05.300]   the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit."
[00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:06.300]   What is it?
[00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:15.380]   The mystery that the Gentiles should be fellow heirs and of the same body and partakers of
[00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:19.340]   his promise in Christ by the gospel.
[00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:22.660]   So you see, that is what makes a man a Christian.
[00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:27.700]   He was out in the world with no hope because he didn't know about the promises of God,
[00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:29.220]   and they didn't apply to him.
[00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:32.980]   When a man is converted, when a man becomes a Christian, what happens?
[00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:37.500]   Oh, he is introduced into the realm of the promises of God.
[00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:44.660]   He becomes a sharer in the promises of God with all the saintly Jews of the past, all
[00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:46.180]   that began in Abraham.
[00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:47.580]   He enters into that.
[00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:54.780]   He becomes a son of Abraham, a child of Abraham, a child of faith at the same time.
[00:25:54.780 --> 00:26:01.420]   So you see, it is obvious, isn't it, from the whole of the scriptural teaching that
[00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:10.260]   this question of our relationship to the promises of God is basic and fundamental and central.
[00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:12.180]   Had we realized that?
[00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:14.020]   Do we realize that?
[00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:19.700]   It is because he did that Peter says, "These promises are precious.
[00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:21.980]   They are exceeding great."
[00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:27.220]   Let me say just a word in the second place about the relationship between faith and these
[00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:30.180]   promises.
[00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:34.060]   And I think it is quite clear, isn't it, from what I have been quoting.
[00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:38.460]   Indeed the apostle Peter puts it here.
[00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:41.780]   Faith leads us to believe the promises.
[00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:45.260]   That is the relationship.
[00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:49.220]   Faith is not something that ends in and of itself.
[00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:56.660]   Faith is a kind of channel that leads us to or links us to the promises and the riches
[00:26:56.660 --> 00:27:00.700]   of God's grace and glory.
[00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:03.540]   Faith is that which makes the promises real to us.
[00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:07.660]   That is the meaning of that first great verse in the eleventh chapter of the epistle to
[00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:09.020]   the Hebrews.
[00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:15.380]   Faith is the substance of things hoped for.
[00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:20.340]   It is the evidence and the witness of things not seen.
[00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:23.700]   That is what faith is.
[00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:28.860]   Faith is that which enables a man to know that the promise of God is true and that it
[00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:32.860]   is sure that it will never be broken.
[00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:37.180]   Faith is that which enables a man to see these promises so clearly that he says, "I will
[00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:41.420]   risk my whole life and eternal future upon it."
[00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:45.980]   It makes them so real to him that he is prepared to live on them and by them.
[00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:50.700]   Well now let me give you the statement of that again as the apostle puts it so clearly
[00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:52.740]   in the epistle to the Hebrews.
[00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:59.580]   In many ways this is the one great theme of the epistle to the Hebrews.
[00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:04.660]   There again you see were a number of unhappy and miserable Christians.
[00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:09.140]   And what the author is teaching them is that they are unhappy because they had not understood
[00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:11.460]   the teaching about the promises.
[00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:15.240]   And so you see he gives them that great eleventh chapter which I have read to you.
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:18.100]   But he has already done the same thing in chapter six.
[00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:20.500]   Listen to this.
[00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:25.540]   Chapter six verses eleven and twelve, "We desire that every one of you do show the same
[00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:31.820]   diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end.
[00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:41.340]   That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit
[00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:42.340]   the promises."
[00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:43.340]   That's it.
[00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:46.060]   He says, "Now what you've got to do is this.
[00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:47.900]   You've got to be diligent in this matter.
[00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:49.540]   You've got to study your scriptures.
[00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:50.820]   You've got to know your facts.
[00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:52.560]   You must live on your feelings.
[00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:55.420]   Look at the objective promises of God.
[00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:57.620]   Read the story of your great forefathers.
[00:28:57.620 --> 00:28:59.980]   Put diligence, put energy into this."
[00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:05.940]   And then he says, "You will find that as the result of this faith and patience you
[00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:13.580]   will be followers of them who by now have entered into the glory everlasting."
[00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:20.620]   And then he goes on to remind them how God has given us a great security with regard
[00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:21.620]   to these promises.
[00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:26.580]   He says, "When God made promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater, he swore
[00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:32.700]   by himself, saying, 'Surely, blessing, I will bless thee, and multiplying, I will multiply
[00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:33.700]   thee.'
[00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:36.780]   And so after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.
[00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:41.140]   For men verily swear by the greater, and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of
[00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:50.140]   all strife, wherein God, willing more abundantly to show unto the heirs of promise the immutability
[00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:57.020]   of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath, that by two immutable things, in which it was impossible
[00:29:57.020 --> 00:30:04.500]   for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold on the
[00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:07.820]   hope which is set before us."
[00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:13.540]   Now then, you see God has not only given the promises, he has pledged himself, he has taken
[00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:17.540]   a double oath, his own character is behind it, it cannot fail.
[00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:23.460]   By these two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we might have
[00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:30.180]   a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon this hope that is set before
[00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:31.920]   us.
[00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:40.600]   So you see, the business of faith is to give us a profound assurance with regard to these
[00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:42.260]   promises of God.
[00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:44.040]   So Peter is right, isn't he?
[00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:48.020]   He starts with precious faith, because it is the thing that is essential before we will
[00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:55.140]   ever know and enjoy the exceeding great and precious promises.
[00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:58.300]   Very well, that leads me to my last heading, which is this.
[00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:04.980]   What then are these promises?
[00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:08.420]   Obviously I cannot answer that question exhaustively, I have told you, it is the theme of the whole
[00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:09.740]   Bible from beginning to end.
[00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:11.860]   Let me summarize it.
[00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:14.460]   What are these promises?
[00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:18.980]   They are all God's promises to us in Jesus Christ.
[00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:23.020]   They are all the promises with regard to redemption.
[00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:28.620]   They are the promise of God that the works of the devil are going to be undone.
[00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:30.900]   The promises of God, what are they?
[00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:33.040]   This is what they mean.
[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:37.820]   The perfect world that God made, the paradise in which he put men, perfect men, it is all,
[00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:41.340]   we have lost it, we are out of paradise, paradise lost.
[00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:42.340]   What are the promises?
[00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:44.340]   Oh, paradise to be regained.
[00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:47.620]   That is what they mean.
[00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:53.780]   It is all that God has purposed to bring us from paradise lost to paradise regained.
[00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:59.980]   All the works of the devil are to be undone, the grand regeneration, the restoration of
[00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:06.900]   all things in Christ Jesus to their original glory and even beyond it.
[00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:11.140]   So you see the apostle Paul again in writing the second epistle to the Corinthians in the
[00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:17.660]   first chapter says, "All the promises of God in him are yea, and in him are amen to
[00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:19.780]   the glory of God the Father."
[00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:25.380]   Jesus Christ is the fulfillment of all the promises of God.
[00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:33.300]   He is the everlasting yea, he is the amen to all the promises of God.
[00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:36.100]   That is in essence what the promises mean.
[00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:41.260]   But in order that you and I may be comforted with the comfort which Peter says we ought
[00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:45.860]   to be enjoying, let me divide it up just a little for you.
[00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:51.740]   Obviously here in this second epistle of Peter, the promises have a very particular and special
[00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:54.460]   meaning and application.
[00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:58.940]   The promises in the Old Testament refer to the coming of Christ, his life, his death,
[00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:03.700]   atoning death, his burial and resurrection, the glory that should follow.
[00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:08.380]   Well, by when Peter wrote this he had been, he had come, that had been fulfilled as he
[00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:13.580]   tells them in verse 16, "They saw the glory and the holy month."
[00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:17.980]   So what does he mean here then by special promises, these precious and exceeding great
[00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:18.980]   promises?
[00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:27.420]   Well, he means this, the guarantee that all that he then began is ultimately going to
[00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:29.300]   be completed.
[00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:33.940]   You remember how the book of the Acts of the Apostles begins.
[00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:37.260]   It is a most significant and important introduction then.
[00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:47.560]   The former treaties have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach.
[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:51.500]   But it is going on and it will go on until the final consummation.
[00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:53.620]   Now there are the promises for us.
[00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:58.460]   We know that Christ has been, he has done the work, the great redemption has been accomplished
[00:33:58.460 --> 00:33:59.860]   there upon the cross.
[00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:00.860]   It is finished.
[00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:04.140]   And yet you and I are struggling.
[00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:09.380]   We are tempted, we are tried, we are in tribulations, we faint and falter and we tend to fall by
[00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:10.380]   the wayside.
[00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:11.380]   Why?
[00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:15.900]   Well, because we are not aware of the promises that still apply to us.
[00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:16.900]   What are they?
[00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:20.260]   Well, I have tried to divide them like this.
[00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:25.020]   These exceeding great and precious promises can be divided into ultimate and immediate.
[00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:29.060]   That is how I like to think of them.
[00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:30.060]   The ultimate.
[00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:36.620]   Here I am, I am a journeyman, I am traveling, I am in a pilgrimage.
[00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:37.620]   Where am I going?
[00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:40.340]   Ah, that is the ultimate.
[00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:41.340]   What are these promises?
[00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:46.700]   Well, the ultimate promise is this, the promise of his coming.
[00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:51.020]   You see, that is the thing that the apostle deals with in the third chapter of this second
[00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:52.020]   epistle.
[00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:56.620]   He says, "Knowing this first, that they shall come in the last day scoffers, walking after
[00:34:56.620 --> 00:35:02.340]   their own lusts and saying, 'Where is the promise of his coming?'"
[00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:03.340]   The scoffers.
[00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:09.380]   "And the answer is, 'Beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day with the Lord
[00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:13.340]   is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.
[00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:19.020]   The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness, but is longsuffering
[00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:23.860]   to usward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.
[00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:30.740]   But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night."
[00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:31.740]   And so on.
[00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:34.420]   Now then, the ultimate can be summarized in that way.
[00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:41.920]   It is all that is involved in the promise of his coming.
[00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:47.740]   This is the thing to which the whole of the New Testament is looking forward.
[00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:52.700]   Every word in the New Testament is looking forward to this.
[00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:56.260]   This is the thing, I say, by which they live.
[00:35:56.260 --> 00:36:00.260]   You remember what was told of the apostles there on Mount Olivet?
[00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:08.580]   As they saw him ascending unto him, they said, "Jesus shall so come even as he is now departing."
[00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:12.540]   The promise of his coming.
[00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:13.540]   What is this?
[00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:22.500]   Well, I say it is the final consummation and completion of his blessed work of redemption.
[00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:26.500]   He is the Savior of the world.
[00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:36.500]   God has handed it over to him, God's great purpose and plan of redemption, regeneration,
[00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:39.740]   restoration.
[00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:41.020]   Certain things have happened.
[00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:42.760]   Certain things are to happen.
[00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:45.580]   When we meet at the communion table, what do we do?
[00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:50.420]   We declare the Lord's death till he comes.
[00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:51.420]   That is it.
[00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:57.380]   We have the promises, the covenants, which sustain us until he shall come again.
[00:36:57.380 --> 00:37:01.620]   But now, how does this affect us in particular?
[00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:04.020]   Why should I be interested in his coming?
[00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:07.980]   Well, the apostle gives us the answer in this one verse.
[00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:13.660]   He says, "Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises, that by these,
[00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:19.820]   by means of these, through these, the outworking of these, you might be partakers of the divine
[00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:25.840]   nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust."
[00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:27.620]   This is why I am interested.
[00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:30.140]   Look at the negative first.
[00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:36.760]   Escaping the corruption that is in the world through lust.
[00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:39.920]   This is what the promise is holding out to me.
[00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:41.260]   I believe in Christ.
[00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:42.580]   My sins are forgiven.
[00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:43.580]   I am redeemed.
[00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:47.320]   I am a child of God, but I am not perfect.
[00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:50.460]   There is corruption still within me.
[00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:53.340]   There is corruption in the world in which I live.
[00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:56.460]   We fight the world, the flesh, the devil.
[00:37:56.460 --> 00:38:01.140]   We are involved in this whole evil that is in the world round and about us, and do what
[00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:02.140]   we will.
[00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:03.460]   We cannot escape out of it here.
[00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:04.580]   But this is the promise.
[00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:08.180]   I am going to be entirely delivered from it.
[00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:10.300]   I am being delivered from it.
[00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:14.220]   I have been separated from it spiritually, but I am not free from it.
[00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:20.300]   But there is a day coming when I shall be absolutely free from it.
[00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:30.060]   "Knowing," says Paul in Romans 6, 6, "that the old man was crucified with Christ,
[00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:37.340]   that the body of sin might be destroyed," disemboweled, finally disintegrated.
[00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:40.740]   So you see, this is the great promise.
[00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:47.380]   Are you weary in the struggle, the struggle against sin and temptation and evil?
[00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:51.580]   Do you hate the pollution that you feel is round and about you and that gets into your
[00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:57.100]   mind and disturbs you and makes you feel unclean and ashamed?
[00:38:57.100 --> 00:39:00.180]   Is this the thing that every Christian is conscious of?
[00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:02.260]   And the longing to be delivered from all this?
[00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:03.260]   Well, it is all right.
[00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:04.260]   You have got a promise.
[00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:05.500]   He is going to do that.
[00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:08.060]   That is the ultimate end and object of it all.
[00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:09.060]   Well, now there is the negative.
[00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:12.180]   And it is a very good way of starting, isn't it?
[00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:16.820]   What a terrible thing it would be to contemplate having to live to all eternity in a kind of
[00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:19.820]   atmosphere such as you have got in this world this morning.
[00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:22.700]   But that is what is going to be the lot of all who are not Christians.
[00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:24.780]   That is hell.
[00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:29.940]   Going on with all this in its ugliness and foulness and putrefying element.
[00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:31.820]   That is it.
[00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:34.500]   But the Christian is promised entire deliverance from it.
[00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:35.500]   But look at the positive.
[00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:39.300]   Partakers of the divine nature.
[00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:43.500]   And this is a glorious and a wonderful thing.
[00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:50.380]   That by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption
[00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:53.260]   that is in the world through lust.
[00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:54.260]   What does it mean?
[00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:56.940]   It does not mean that we are going to be gods.
[00:39:56.940 --> 00:40:00.480]   It does not mean that we are going to partake of God's essence.
[00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:03.940]   But it does mean this.
[00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:14.140]   That we are going to be sharers in, participators in, and partakers of the holiness of God himself.
[00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:17.660]   His righteousness, his truth.
[00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:18.980]   We are going to enjoy that.
[00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:20.480]   We are going to be like that.
[00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:24.060]   When God made man at the beginning, he made him in his own image and likeness.
[00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:26.460]   That is what we have forfeited in the fall.
[00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:30.340]   We have not got it any longer, but we are going to have it back.
[00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:35.300]   That is what he means by partakers of the divine nature.
[00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:39.500]   We shall be delivered from everything that is unworthy and sinful and unrighteous and
[00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:41.940]   unclean and foul.
[00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:46.980]   Be ye holy even as I am holy, and we shall be.
[00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:52.300]   Now this is the thing that the scripture keeps on promising us from beginning to end.
[00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:56.740]   And that is why they are so exceedingly great and precious.
[00:40:56.740 --> 00:41:00.580]   Christian people, this is the thing I say again that should put us on our feet and make
[00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:04.480]   us shout in exultation and sing in endless praise.
[00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:05.480]   What is it?
[00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:08.140]   Well, listen to Paul putting it.
[00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:15.100]   I am persuaded, he says, I reckon, that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy
[00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:20.380]   to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.
[00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:23.420]   He talks about the manifestation of the sons of God.
[00:41:23.420 --> 00:41:24.420]   What does it mean?
[00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:28.620]   This is what the Bible calls glorification.
[00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:31.220]   Do you know that you and I were in Christ?
[00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:36.980]   There is a day coming when we shall neither have spot nor wrinkle nor any such thing.
[00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:40.220]   We shall be entirely whole and entirely holy.
[00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:45.020]   Our very bodies shall be perfected.
[00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:50.140]   The apostle says about himself and other Christians that our condition at the moment is this.
[00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:56.300]   "Even we," he says, "who have received the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves
[00:41:56.300 --> 00:42:04.980]   groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body."
[00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:10.260]   To Corinthians 5, "In this tabernacle we do groan, being burdened, earnestly desiring
[00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:15.860]   to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven."
[00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:17.660]   The very body is going to be redeemed.
[00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:22.220]   There will be no infirmity, there will be no disease, there will be no failure.
[00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:28.020]   It shall be entirely perfect and whole, partakers of the divine nature.
[00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:30.220]   Listen to the apostle John putting this.
[00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:34.540]   I seem to find a wonderful competition in these New Testament writers.
[00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:37.820]   Each one is trying to put it in a more glorious manner than the other.
[00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:38.820]   Listen to John.
[00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:43.140]   "Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called
[00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:44.820]   the sons of God.
[00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:47.580]   Therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew not him."
[00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:50.460]   Is there somebody in this congregation who does not know what I am talking about this
[00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:51.460]   morning?
[00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:56.140]   If so, my dear friend, you are in the world, you are dead, you are putrefied, and you will
[00:42:56.140 --> 00:43:00.620]   go on to endless putrefaction unless you suddenly realize the truth of these things.
[00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:01.620]   Listen.
[00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:05.780]   "Beloved, now are we the sons of God.
[00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:13.420]   It does not yet appear what we shall be, but we know that when he shall appear we shall
[00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:21.300]   be like him, for we shall see him as he is."
[00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:27.540]   We shall see him, we shall be like him, we shall share something of his wonderful glory.
[00:43:27.540 --> 00:43:33.180]   Do you remember how he put it himself, "Let not your hearts be troubled, ye believe in
[00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:35.420]   God, believe also in me.
[00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:38.620]   In my Father's house were many mansions."
[00:43:38.620 --> 00:43:40.980]   If it were not so, I would have told you.
[00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:43.100]   I go to prepare a place for you.
[00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:47.620]   And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you unto myself,
[00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:51.700]   that where I am, there you may be also.
[00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:55.420]   Exceeding great and precious promises, that is what is awaiting you.
[00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:57.380]   Are you grumbling and complaining?
[00:43:57.380 --> 00:43:59.620]   Are you telling to say, "Why is God dealing with me like this?"
[00:43:59.620 --> 00:44:01.100]   Do you know what is happening?
[00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:03.700]   He is just preparing you for that.
[00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:07.100]   And he sometimes has to chastise you because you are fool enough not to believe what he
[00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:08.180]   says.
[00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:11.100]   But he, you are his child, and he is preparing you for that.
[00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:13.220]   He is purifying you, he is perfecting you.
[00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:14.900]   You are going to see him as he is.
[00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:17.220]   You are going to share with him the glory everlasting.
[00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:20.660]   Do you not remember our Lord's great high priestly prayer?
[00:44:20.660 --> 00:44:26.580]   He puts it like this, "Father, I will that they also whom thou hast given me be with
[00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:34.060]   me where I am, that they may behold my glory which thou hast given me, for thou lovest
[00:44:34.060 --> 00:44:38.020]   me before the foundation of the world."
[00:44:38.020 --> 00:44:42.580]   I shall see him face to face.
[00:44:42.580 --> 00:44:44.540]   I shall look into the glory.
[00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:45.900]   I shall be like him.
[00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:49.860]   I shall share it with him.
[00:44:49.860 --> 00:44:54.100]   Indeed we are told in 1 Corinthians 6 that we shall reign with him.
[00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:55.460]   We shall judge angels.
[00:44:55.460 --> 00:44:57.140]   We shall judge the world.
[00:44:57.140 --> 00:45:02.100]   In other words, we shall govern with him and share in his eternal glory.
[00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:04.220]   That is the ultimate of the promise.
[00:45:04.220 --> 00:45:06.700]   Those are the things that are held before you.
[00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:09.100]   These are the things by which we ought to live.
[00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:10.100]   What about the immediate?
[00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:12.020]   Let me just give you my headings.
[00:45:12.020 --> 00:45:16.140]   "All right," says someone, "that is very wonderful, you know, and while I am
[00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:20.220]   in the chapel I feel uplifted, but then I go back into the world and I am down again.
[00:45:20.220 --> 00:45:21.820]   My dear friend, you have no right to be.
[00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:23.260]   Keep these things before you.
[00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:24.740]   Hold on to them," says Peter.
[00:45:24.740 --> 00:45:26.460]   "Do not forget them."
[00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:29.820]   But then listen to what he gives you in the meantime.
[00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:35.660]   Everything that is necessary to life and godliness is already provided for you.
[00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:39.060]   Go to John 14, verse 15 to the end.
[00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:41.380]   "I will send you another comforter," he says.
[00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:43.140]   "I will not leave you orphans.
[00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:47.540]   I am going, but I will send him and he will be in you and he will lead you and guide you
[00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:48.740]   into all truth.
[00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:51.340]   I will come and manifest myself unto you.
[00:45:51.340 --> 00:45:53.500]   I will take up my abode in you.
[00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:55.260]   God the Father will do the same."
[00:45:55.260 --> 00:46:02.060]   These are the promises, even while we are here.
[00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:07.460]   "Not only that, the very hairs of your head are all numbered and nothing can happen to
[00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:09.280]   you apart from God."
[00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:10.280]   Listen to this.
[00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:14.820]   "He that spared not his own son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him
[00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:20.180]   also freely give us all things?"
[00:46:20.180 --> 00:46:21.180]   Are you troubled?
[00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:22.300]   Well, listen, this is what he says to you.
[00:46:22.300 --> 00:46:25.780]   "I will never leave thee nor forsake thee."
[00:46:25.780 --> 00:46:28.740]   Whether you are healthy, whether you are ill, whether you are running down the road, whether
[00:46:28.740 --> 00:46:35.900]   you are dying on a bed of pain and of sickness, "I will never leave thee nor forsake thee."
[00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:36.900]   Never.
[00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:41.860]   But you say, "But I still fall and I fall into sin."
[00:46:41.860 --> 00:46:43.580]   All right, my friend, listen.
[00:46:43.580 --> 00:46:49.820]   "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse
[00:46:49.820 --> 00:46:51.540]   us from all unrighteousness."
[00:46:51.540 --> 00:46:55.300]   Do not remain there weeping, crying, whimpering on the ground.
[00:46:55.300 --> 00:46:57.660]   Accept his cleansing in the blood of Christ.
[00:46:57.660 --> 00:46:58.660]   Get up and go on.
[00:46:58.660 --> 00:47:06.420]   "If any men sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous, and
[00:47:06.420 --> 00:47:12.340]   he is the propitiation of our sins and not of ours only, but also of the sins of the
[00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:13.340]   whole world."
[00:47:13.340 --> 00:47:15.300]   Well, there are the promises.
[00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:19.700]   There is the summary, there is the outline, the ultimate, and all you are given in the
[00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:24.140]   present and the immediate to bring you to that and to guarantee that you will arrive
[00:47:24.140 --> 00:47:25.140]   there.
[00:47:25.140 --> 00:47:30.780]   Are these things precious to you?
[00:47:30.780 --> 00:47:35.980]   Are you rejoicing in these exceeding great and precious promises?
[00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:37.840]   Are you absolutely certain of them?
[00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:42.540]   Are you able to say with Top Lady the work which is goodness begin, the arm of his strength
[00:47:42.540 --> 00:47:44.280]   will complete?
[00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:48.780]   His promise is yea and amen and never was profited yet.
[00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:55.340]   His future nor things that are now, nor all things below nor above can make him his purpose
[00:47:55.340 --> 00:47:59.620]   forgo or sever my soul from his love.
[00:47:59.620 --> 00:48:05.740]   My name from the palms of his hands eternity shall not erase.
[00:48:05.740 --> 00:48:11.700]   Impressed on his heart it remains in marks of indelible grace.
[00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:12.700]   Very well.
[00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:19.940]   Yes, I to the end shall endure as sure as the earnest is given.
[00:48:19.940 --> 00:48:27.620]   More happy but not more secure the glorified spirits in heaven.
[00:48:27.620 --> 00:48:33.660]   Oh, this is the thing that has thrilled the saints of the ages, the contemplation of the
[00:48:33.660 --> 00:48:39.500]   exceeding great and precious promises, that final coming, the ultimate consummation.
[00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:44.980]   Listen to one of them crying out, "Oh day for which creation and all its tribes were
[00:48:44.980 --> 00:48:53.380]   made, oh joy for all its former was a thousandfold repaid.
[00:48:53.380 --> 00:49:00.420]   Bring near thy great salvation, thou lamb for sinners slain.
[00:49:00.420 --> 00:49:07.100]   Fill up the role of thine elect, then take thy power and reign.
[00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:16.860]   Appear, desire of nations, thine exiles, long for home.
[00:49:16.860 --> 00:49:27.100]   Show in the heavens thy promised sign, thou prince and saviour.
[00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:29.420]   Come."
[00:49:29.420 --> 00:49:40.740]   And so the Bible ends with these words, "Even so come, Lord Jesus."
[00:49:40.740 --> 00:49:42.540]   Are you saying that?
[00:49:42.540 --> 00:49:48.020]   If not, it's because you haven't realized the exceeding great and precious promises.
[00:49:48.020 --> 00:49:53.580]   But if you have, well there with all the saints on earth and even with the spirits under the
[00:49:53.580 --> 00:50:05.500]   altar you are crying out and saying, "Even so come, Lord Jesus, and let all the exceeding
[00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:17.420]   great and precious promises receive their final full, complete, and abiding fulfillment."
[00:50:17.420 --> 00:50:19.940]   Amen.
[00:50:19.940 --> 00:50:23.860]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
