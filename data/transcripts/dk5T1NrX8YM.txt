[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.880]   All right, let's move on to a question from Philip.
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:16.960]   Philip asks, where should I start with long-term planning?
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.040]   He elaborates, I admire your work a lot.
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.520]   Your advice has been useful.
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.480]   And on the short to medium term, he thinks he's doing well.
[00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.160]   But when it comes to longer-term planning on the scale of years,
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.000]   it is, quote, "quite daunting to me,
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   and I have no idea where to begin," end quote.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.240]   So Philip, I don't know that I would
[00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:44.960]   recommend that you have detailed plans on the scale of years.
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.120]   The short to medium term you talk about,
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.880]   I think, is the sweet spot, where you have
[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.000]   some vision to the future.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   You're out of the short-term context of just reactivity,
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.040]   but it's still tractable.
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.600]   So as you know, I have semester plans,
[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.800]   so plans on the scale of a current season,
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.360]   three of those a year.
[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.860]   And I typically have-- I've talked about this on the show--
[00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.760]   I typically have some sort of birthday project.
[00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.000]   So that's an annual plan.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.520]   By the time I get to my next birthday,
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.000]   these are some bigger picture changes
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.680]   I want to have happen in my life.
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.800]   So right now, I'm 39.
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.520]   Project 40 is ongoing.
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.040]   It's a collection of major changes
[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.640]   I want to work on by the time I turn 40.
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.200]   So I have a semester plan, and I have an annual plan.
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.960]   I don't really go much farther beyond that.
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.680]   I don't go much farther beyond that.
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.120]   So how do you think about the big picture future?
[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.240]   Well, one, this is where having your values nailed down
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.160]   in those semester plan documents is really important.
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.760]   There, you're laying out the properties of your vision
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.040]   of a life well-lived.
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.200]   But it's not specific.
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.620]   It's not, and I'll be in this job,
[00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.960]   and this place, and I'll have this much money,
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.280]   and be able to run a mile at this time.
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.280]   It's not that specific.
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.400]   It's talking about, these are the values I want,
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.160]   the properties I want in my life.
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.860]   And you look at those when you think about your annual birthday
[00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.960]   goals, and you look at those when you build your semester
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.120]   plan to make sure you're making progress towards a life that's
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.080]   more like that.
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.960]   But it's vague and more general than these
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.320]   are very specific things I want to do.
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.480]   The other thing I typically recommend to people,
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.240]   especially early on, is you want to aim yourself
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.960]   not towards an incredibly specific outcome,
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.760]   but towards a direction that's going
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.160]   to have a lot of options that are
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.400]   going to be useful to the type of things you value.
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.760]   When I was coming out of college, for example,
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.040]   and trying to figure out what I wanted to do,
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.040]   I aimed myself towards graduate school and potential
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.160]   professoredom because I thought, at least
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.520]   in the short term of multiple years,
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.920]   this is going to give me a lot more flexibility.
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.520]   I can keep writing books.
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.240]   I'm going to have much more time affluence.
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.880]   I was looking at other options, including going to Microsoft.
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.200]   I had an offer from Microsoft.
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.960]   This seemed like it would be much more structured,
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:04.960]   and have much less time.
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:05.960]   It'd be much more hard charging.
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.840]   I had these other interests I was trying to figure out,
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.520]   but I didn't know exactly where they were going to go.
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.020]   I just thought the options of that direction would be better.
[00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.320]   I like intellectual work.
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.360]   I seem to be doing well intellectually
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.040]   with computer science.
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.920]   Let's take that for a spin.
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:17.960]   I like this writing thing.
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:18.960]   I want to take that for a spin.
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.080]   I want some autonomy there.
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.600]   Let's go down the grad school path.
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.000]   It's the right direction towards more options.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.040]   And then over time, it gets refined.
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.000]   And OK, I'm definitely going to do this with my writing.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.160]   I'm definitely going to do a professoredom.
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.320]   Here's the type of professoredom I'm going to do.
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.120]   The details of my life today were not on the docket
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.760]   when I was 22 years old.
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.260]   But I pointed myself in a direction
[00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.040]   that situations like my current situation would be possible.
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.120]   So that's what I would say.
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.400]   You don't need detailed plans beyond a semester,
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.560]   plus maybe some goals for your life
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.800]   for each year at your birthday.
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.240]   Beyond that, just aim yourself towards directions
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.120]   that will be congruent with your values
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.480]   and figure things out as it unfolds.
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.840]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
