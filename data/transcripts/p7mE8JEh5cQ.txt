[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - Are there any sex differences, male-female differences
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.320]   in sort of these dopamine levels, working memory,
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:18.360]   injuries, concussion, like things that would direct people
[00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.680]   toward different routes of treatment given that, you know,
[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.560]   maybe there's more susceptibility in one case,
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:25.740]   maybe less susceptibility,
[00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.820]   maybe certain neurotransmitters are more effective
[00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.280]   in improving symptoms in men versus women.
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.780]   Do you see that in the clinic?
[00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.600]   - Yeah, that's a great question.
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.440]   There was Emily Jacobs, who's a professor
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.540]   at UC Santa Barbara now in the psychology department,
[00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.200]   when she was a graduate student in my lab,
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.680]   studied the role of estrogen on working memory
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.600]   and dopaminergic function.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.560]   And what she brought to my attention at the time,
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.720]   and it was embarrassing that I didn't know,
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.340]   was that the frontal lobes are full of estrogen receptors.
[00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.200]   There's probably more estrogen receptors
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.800]   in the frontal lobes than any other part of the brain.
[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.640]   - In men and women.
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.360]   - Estrogen boosts dopamine.
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.280]   So higher estrogen levels correlates
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.440]   with increased dopamine levels.
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.920]   And there was some anecdotal evidence
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.600]   that in postmenopausal women who were put on estrogen
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.560]   that their working memory improved,
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.740]   and there was a kind of evolving link
[00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.000]   between estrogen and frontal lobe function.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.960]   She did this amazing study where she studied
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.960]   healthy Berkeley undergraduates at two points in time
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.280]   during their menstrual cycle when estrogen was at its lowest
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.200]   and what was its highest, and she also genotyped them
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.920]   for this enzyme they were talking about
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.120]   to know if they were sort of lower or higher
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.240]   on the dopamine level, and then put them in the scanner
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.800]   and measured frontal lobe function,
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.440]   and showed that there was a clear,
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.900]   the frontal lobe function was modulated
[00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.700]   by where they were in their estrogen cycle.
[00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.160]   When they were low estrogen, they were low dopamine,
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.680]   and if they were low estrogen and low dopamine to start,
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.760]   they really had decreased frontal lobe function
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.640]   and decreased working memory ability.
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.760]   So it fluctuated based on this interaction
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.120]   between estrogen and dopamine,
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.040]   suggesting that not only is dopamine important,
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.160]   but hormones are clearly important,
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.800]   and they work synergistically.
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.220]   So as we're developing this cocktail,
[00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.840]   we certainly have to bring hormones into the equation
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.460]   and learn more about it.
[00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.080]   There's just so little information
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.640]   about hormones and cognition.
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.280]   - Yeah, one of the themes that's come out
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.280]   of some of the episodes we've done with MDs
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.360]   who specialize in endocrine health
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.840]   is that for both men and for women,
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.360]   optimizing estrogen levels is really important
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.120]   for cognition and vascular function.
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.360]   I think people mistakenly hear,
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.320]   okay, testosterone, men, estrogen, women,
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.540]   obviously both hormones are present in men and women.
[00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.400]   In fact, I think, I know that testosterone levels in women
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.560]   are actually higher than their estrogen levels
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.560]   when you sort of use the same units of measure.
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.800]   It just so happens that they still have lower testosterone
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.800]   on average than the typical male,
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.280]   but that men whose estrogen levels are too low
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.240]   suffer cognitive defects and vascular defects.
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.000]   So this idea that more testosterone,
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.480]   lower estrogen in men is the ideal,
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.280]   and it just doesn't hold, it doesn't hold.
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.040]   I mean, unless you want to be dumb and have a heart attack,
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.220]   it just doesn't hold, very interesting.
[00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.800]   Do we know what estrogen is doing there?
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.080]   Is it, it's specifically raising dopamine.
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.000]   We don't have to get into the synaptic biology,
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.740]   but it's so interesting.
[00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.740]   - Yeah, it's actually boosting dopamine activity.
[00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.240]   - So it's making more dopamine available.
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.960]   - Yeah, yeah, it's really amazing.
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.960]   And to think about it sort of fluctuating,
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.400]   certainly during the menstrual cycle,
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.040]   we can think about how much it fluctuates
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.000]   in an individual woman over 30 days,
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.960]   but then you can think across individuals,
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.480]   you can think about how much it can account
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.800]   for individual differences.
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.600]   So not only sort of knowing your dopamine level,
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.960]   but just knowing sort of estrogen and serotonin
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.800]   is really going to be important.
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:14.640]   - Interesting.
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.740]   (upbeat music)
[00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:20.320]   (upbeat music)
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.420]   (upbeat music)
