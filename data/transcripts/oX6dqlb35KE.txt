[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.800]   So it sounds like any form of cold to the skin that people register as what you call
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.040]   the cold shock or uncomfortable, like, oh, like this is kind of jarring, activates the
[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.040]   brown fat.
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.680]   Do we know what the pathway is from cold receptors on the skin to the brown fat?
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.200]   I mean, how does the brown fat know that we're cold?
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.200]   Yeah, really good question.
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.340]   And it seems that I, I think that of course, in the future, we will know much more about
[00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.340]   these pathways.
[00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.040]   But what we do know is that the cold receptors will send a signal to our temperature regulating
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.480]   center in the brain, so hypothalamus.
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.640]   And that's going to be taking in this message.
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.520]   And we have so many cold receptors in the skin.
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.360]   So it's going to be very fast.
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.820]   As you can say, if you immerse the body into cold water, this is going to be so rapid.
[00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:58.280]   So it will have a rapid increase in neurotransmitters in the brain from noradrenaline, adrenaline
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.320]   cortisol, and which is not that much, but it's but it's still there.
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:08.360]   So you have this increase in noradrenaline, which will then immediately activate the brown
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.360]   fat.
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.080]   And because the you can say the activator is the most potent one, cold and noradrenaline,
[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.080]   that's going to activate the brown fat.
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.840]   But there's also a direct pathway from the cold receptors in the skin to the to the brown
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:26.880]   fat, which really shows that if because of these different pathways, it shows that that
[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:35.520]   it could be that this tissue to keep us warm, or was developed in our involvement as humans
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:42.000]   to keep us warm and to save us whenever the temperature on our skin varies just a little
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.580]   bit to keep us in that right homeostatic balance.
[00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.660]   So we don't get hypothermic.
[00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.800]   But also so we don't get hyperthermic, because it seems that the brown fat is also activated
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.180]   when we get warm on our skin.
[00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:02.380]   So it's also maybe a temperature regulator in our in our body, but the pathways is different.
[00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.380]   I think it's also a third pathway from directly from the muscles.
[00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:12.140]   So the brown fat is also activated, even though the muscles are starting to shiver.
[00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.660]   So there's an extra pathway that way to keep our, our temperature up.
[00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.040]   So muscles and brown fat are working together to to keep us warm.
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.180]   So we don't suffer too much in the in the cold water.
[00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.180]   Super interesting.
[00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.460]   And what I hear you pointing to is the existence of three parallel pathways.
[00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.060]   And this notion of parallel pathways comes up over and over again in biology, as you
[00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.820]   and I know, and I mean, I think it's important for people to know about because, as you said,
[00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:46.540]   so so eloquently, the when something is very important to our survival or end or evolution,
[00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:52.060]   the brain and body install multiple mechanisms for it, not just one.
[00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:58.360]   And and so it sounds like it's cold skin, cold on the skin, triggers and a response
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.800]   in the hypothalamus, which then activates brown fat, cold receptors in the skin directly
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:08.020]   to the brown fat, and then shivering in the muscle to the brown fat.
[00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:14.180]   I want to talk about brown fat in depth and learn from you more about brown fat.
[00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.920]   Before that, however, I want to ask about shiver.
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:26.260]   I've heard that shiver causes the release of succinate, which then activates the brown
[00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.260]   fat.
[00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.500]   Is it known whether or not inducing shiver is important?
[00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.900]   And when should people shiver?
[00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.960]   I mean, I've gotten into cold plunges and shivered while I was in there.
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.860]   And then I've also had the experience of getting into a cold plunge or a cold shower, then
[00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.540]   getting out when even standing outside on a warm day after swimming in a pool and then
[00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:46.580]   starting to shiver.
[00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.020]   So the shiver comes later.
[00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.420]   So how important is shiver?
[00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.260]   And does it matter when shiver happens?
[00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:57.220]   Yeah, it was shivering is good, because that increases your metabolism, and that's going
[00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.420]   to burn some calories in your body.
[00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.300]   You shouldn't be so afraid of shivering, I think, because the shivering, as long as you
[00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.740]   don't get too hypothermic.
[00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:09.780]   So if you don't, if you don't sit in the cold water for too long, and and what you just
[00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.820]   said by shivering after you get up, that is because of the after drop something called
[00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:19.900]   the after drop is when your core temperature decreases even after you get out of the cold
[00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:20.900]   water.
[00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:26.300]   And it always does that your body because it as soon as you get into the cold water,
[00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:32.140]   all your blood vessels is going to constrict because you need to keep your blood in your
[00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.700]   core and keep your vital organs warm.
[00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:40.220]   So as soon as you get up that those blood vessels will open again, and the warm blood
[00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.700]   would flow out and get colder and then flow back again into the core.
[00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.460]   And that's going to decrease the temperature in your core, of course.
[00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:48.660]   So that's the drop.
[00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:49.660]   So that's the drop.
[00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:50.660]   Yeah.
[00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:51.660]   I'm so glad you explained that.
[00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.140]   I've heard years ago, Wim Hof, I heard him talk about the drop.
[00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.100]   And I've heard colleagues of mine talk about the drop.
[00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.020]   But that's the first time I've ever heard it explained clearly.
[00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.140]   Let me make sure I understand this.
[00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:05.860]   So I get into cold water, obviously, I'm cold.
[00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.980]   Vessels constrict to keep blood near the center of my body, keep me alive.
[00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:17.460]   I get out, the warming up of my body allows those vessels and capillaries to dilate again,
[00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.860]   the blood goes out to the surface, but the surface is still cold.
[00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.600]   And so that blood is cooled.
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.780]   And then my core body temperature drops.
[00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.580]   And that's what you're referring to as the drop.
[00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.020]   And that's what induces shiver.
[00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:30.020]   Exactly.
[00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.020]   Great.
[00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.980]   And then, am I right in thinking that then the shiver activates brown fat, which then
[00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:35.220]   warms me up again?
[00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:36.220]   Yes.
[00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:37.220]   Got it.
[00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:38.220]   That's why you should end on the cold.
[00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:39.220]   We can get back to that.
[00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:40.220]   Let's talk about it.
[00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:41.220]   Yes.
[00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:46.540]   Ending on cold, it's what I refer to as, and what has now become known as the Soberg principle,
[00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:51.860]   which is a really important principle about the importance of ending on cold and not doing
[00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.940]   what I do, which is to get into a hot shower or back in the sauna, but we'll get back to
[00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.420]   that in a few minutes.
[00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:04.020]   So that's wonderful that you can explain that so clearly, because I think that shiver is
[00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.260]   something that a lot of people do avoid.
[00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:11.500]   People think, "Oh, I don't want the chattering of the teeth," and it feels like a loss of
[00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.540]   bodily control, which really it is.
[00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:14.820]   It's an autonomic response.
[00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:18.340]   Yes, but I don't think that people should avoid it that much.
[00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:24.040]   It's just like seeing shivering as a way of your body, it's training.
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:29.140]   It's training for all your cells, it's training for your muscles, it's training of your metabolism,
[00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:32.580]   and that's going to increase what's called the insulin sensitivity.
[00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:39.500]   So if you can, in your mind, get used to the thought of shivering, it's just like when
[00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:44.380]   you go exercising in the training center and get that feeling of like, "Oh, this is tough.
[00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:45.380]   Now it hurts a little bit."
[00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:49.780]   Yeah, it's going to hurt because that's what shivering also does, but it's just a different
[00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:52.100]   way of training your cells in your body.
[00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:55.900]   It's going to create what is healthy stress, it's called homesis in the cells.
[00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:01.580]   And the more you expose your muscle cells or your brown fat cells to these kind of healthy
[00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:07.900]   stresses, exercise, cold, heat, exposure, it's going to make them better at activating
[00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.700]   and also at keeping you healthy.
[00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:16.580]   So as long as the cells get exposed to this, it's going to keep them on its toes, you can
[00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:22.760]   say, because it becomes more robust, increasing these heat shock proteins and cold shock proteins
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:28.340]   in the cells to make you more robust for the next time.
[00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:31.360]   And that is also what happens when you go to the training center.
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:36.420]   And I keep drawing that parallel, because people today know more about, we know more
[00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:42.780]   about exercise and what that is going to do to your muscle cells.
[00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:48.180]   But the same kind of training is also what you do when you go out into the cold water
[00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:52.900]   and submerge into cold water, because that is just your cold training center, you can
[00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:53.900]   say that.
[00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:58.620]   And also your heat training center going into the sauna, because the cells are getting stronger
[00:07:58.620 --> 00:07:59.620]   with hormetic stress.
[00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:01.900]   So it's the same process, just different practices.
[00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:10.140]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
