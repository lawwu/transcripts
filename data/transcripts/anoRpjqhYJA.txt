[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040]   Define posture for me, because I think that's a really great place to start, right?
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.040]   Yeah.
[00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.800]   I can define bad posture as when you catch yourself in a reflection and you realize,
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.000]   "Wow, I'm starting to look more like a C than a not."
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   That's so great.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.160]   The question is, is that a matter of aesthetics or pain?
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:28.720]   Well, certainly for me, it's not pain, but, you know, I notice that unless I pay attention
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:34.240]   to my posture while sitting, unless I do, you know, like bridge my fingers together
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:39.600]   and pull my chin back a few times a day, that I'm just naturally starting to tip over forward
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.540]   towards my text messages that aren't even in my hands right now.
[00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.960]   And I think this is, you know, the younger generation, I mean, now that I'm 49, I can
[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:48.960]   talk like that, right?
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:49.960]   I mean, it's striking.
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.960]   Were you born in the 1900s?
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:52.960]   They are.
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:53.960]   Late 1900s?
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:54.960]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.800]   And I think they're starting to look like they're shaped like a C. And I'm a big believer
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.160]   in people, especially men, doing neck work.
[00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.960]   I feel like if you especially-
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.080]   How about especially people doing neck work?
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.080]   Yeah.
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.080]   Well, here's the thing.
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.600]   Anytime, I'm happy to go there with this one, maybe even at the risk of being politically
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.600]   incorrect.
[00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.640]   Anytime I've suggested that women also do neck work, they say no.
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.360]   You should see my goalie daughter because for every pound stronger your neck is, your
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.040]   reduction in concussion risk drops huge, a pound.
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.040]   Thank you.
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.480]   So we keep the iron neck by the door and she walks in.
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.600]   And we have a video in our family where she's doing her iron neck training.
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.600]   She looks at me.
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.440]   She's like, "Dad, this is why I don't have a boyfriend."
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.440]   Thank you.
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.440]   Sorry, Caroline.
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.440]   But that's the way it goes, right?
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.440]   Because she's like, "Look at me.
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.440]   I look like an idiot."
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.880]   But she loves having a big, strong neck that can take the shot from the ball.
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:46.880]   Yeah.
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:47.880]   Listen, I wish everyone would train their neck.
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.840]   I had an accident where I fell off a roof, walked away from it.
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.960]   My neck was sore, but I heard it and felt it.
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:54.960]   And I was like, "Oh, goodness."
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.720]   But it was actually from skateboarding stuff and falling and that I started training my
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.480]   neck years ago and realized that, wow, when I train my neck, I'm one of the few people
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.640]   in my age cohort that doesn't complain about shoulder pain.
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.480]   Now, maybe I don't have full range of motion, maybe I'm hanging out with the wrong people,
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:16.040]   but anytime I see somebody with really broad shoulders where their neck is really inside
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.000]   of their jawline, it looks like a head was placed on the wrong action figure body, I
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.680]   just want to go over to them and say, "Listen, A, it's aesthetically ridiculous.
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.120]   It looks like one of those flip books in the kids where you can change the head, the body,
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.520]   and the legs to be different animals.
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.200]   More seriously, it's a hazard because it's your upper spine.
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.220]   It's clearly not in line with the rest of your strength profile."
[00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.920]   And the other one is the more incentive-based thing is, "Hey, listen, if you train your
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.400]   neck, everything else gets stronger and your brain is going to be safer."
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.960]   And as a neuroscientist, I usually listen to the last piece.
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:47.960]   Love it.
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:48.960]   Love it.
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:49.960]   I'm so glad we're talking about this.
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.400]   When I do bridges, I know that it can be risky with tongue in the roof of my mouth, I do
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.160]   bridges to the back, and then I do have a four-way neck machine or I use a plate.
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.480]   Jeff Cavalier has got a great video of how to do this that we can link to, how to do
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.480]   it safely.
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.160]   You got to close the chain by having a hand on the ground, this kind of thing to do it
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.160]   safely.
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.720]   But I've just found that neck work also serves posture.
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.280]   Posture serves the ability to make eye contact when you have those things we call conversations
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.200]   with people in real life.
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.640]   And I do think these things stack up to, we won't call it like psychological confidence,
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.480]   but the ability to meet somebody, like firm handshake, you're not trying to crush the
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.500]   other person's hand, look people in the eye, stand up straight, whatever your height.
[00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.240]   These things really matter in subtle ways or not so subtle ways.
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:38.520]   I think that I do feel like, yes, that the younger generation and the older generation,
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.180]   they kind of drop out of certain elements of life.
[00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.920]   If you're looking down at the ground or your phone all the time, you can't look people
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:45.920]   in the eye.
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.680]   You're posturally not right, you're in pain, you're not as strong as you could be.
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.640]   I mean, these things stack up to being like in an aquarium full of fish.
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.760]   You're becoming the fish in the background that's like, it was kind of sickly and the
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.600]   other fish are getting all the good stuff.
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:08.360]   If you define posture as like the Latin word root is position.
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:13.160]   So what we're really saying is I have good position, I have bad position.
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:19.960]   One of the ways I think we've lost the narrative a little bit is we try to give people these
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:24.080]   extrinsic cues to correct their posture, shoulders back and down, check your tent.
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.560]   So all of a sudden you're like, well, when am I going to be a human being?
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.600]   How do I practice this when I'm doing a complex skill?
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:35.300]   So the organization of your body, the organization of your spine particularly, really is a reflection
[00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.320]   of your movement habits, your behaviors, your self-identity.
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.280]   There's a lot of things in there, right?
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.840]   You didn't get the job.
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.280]   You won the, you got the number from Juliette.
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.360]   Or you're sleep deprived even, or, and I'm going to call myself out because people are
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.360]   going to do it.
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.840]   There are many times on this podcast when I go and I look at the, because I do listen
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.520]   to the podcast, try and see places I can improve, et cetera.
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.080]   And I'll be like, wow, my posture, I'm like hunched over.
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.080]   And I think to myself, and I'll go and I look-
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.600]   You're just reflecting my posture.
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:01.600]   No, no.
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.600]   And I track my sleep.
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.080]   So, you know, I'll go back and look and I'll be like, yeah, I wasn't sleeping as well those
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.240]   days or whatever it is, right?
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.320]   I mean, I think that we're, we are all guilty of not paying enough attention to our posture.
[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:20.560]   So what we can do is we could define posture as there is a median range of the joint positioning
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.520]   where we simultaneously have most access to our physiology, right?
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:29.480]   And I'll explain that a little more, but also those shapes aren't associated with increased
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:33.140]   pain risk and increased injury risk, which is real.
[00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:39.200]   The research does bear that, that there are positions and shapes that lead to less effective
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.760]   movement and are more likely to experience pain.
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:46.360]   It's probabilistic, it's not guaranteed, there's more likely.
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:51.680]   So one of the things that I think you could understand is, hey, do you want to have access
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.000]   to all of the machinery?
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.560]   So go ahead and slouch.
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.560]   Go ahead with me.
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:57.640]   And then just turn over your shoulder.
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:58.640]   How far can you turn?
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:59.640]   Yeah, not very far.
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:00.640]   Now watch this.
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:01.640]   Get into a position where you take a huge breath.
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.960]   Get into the biggest position where you take the biggest breath.
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.840]   Okay, so that's a pretty rocking shape.
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.700]   Now turn your head, it goes further.
[00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:18.400]   So by you being cued, can you adopt a shape, an organization of your trunk that allows
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.680]   you to ventilate a little bit more effectively?
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:26.040]   You completely change and reorganize your structure, which led to an improvement in
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.640]   output.
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:31.920]   So when I'm working with people, there's only two things I really can wrap my head around.
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:34.360]   One is, do you have normative range of motion?
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.360]   Yes or no?
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.800]   Do you have the tools we have to restore that and improve that?
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.000]   And does that expression give us greater biomotor output?
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.360]   Because those are objective measures.
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:48.040]   When biomotor output, I mean range of motion, force production, power, I see that I can
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:53.160]   express the physiology in a unique way that makes me more effective.
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:58.080]   And that is why you'll see suddenly we have this definition that is maintaining the physiology
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.360]   and aspects.
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:03.600]   I'm not going to have as good shoulder flexion with my arm over my head as when I'm sitting
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:07.160]   up taller or in a position where I can take a bigger breath.
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:11.040]   And I think that's what's really great because that gets us away from good posture, bad posture
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:16.200]   into, hey, that position doesn't serve you as well in these circumstances.
[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:21.400]   And in this position, I'm working with the pararescue team in the Air Force.
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:26.520]   The number one reason they were having back injuries was getting the litter out of the
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:31.960]   helicopter because they have a litter, the soldiers there with all their gear on, they've
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:36.240]   got to lift from a totally weird flexed position, right?
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:41.520]   And this just turns out it's not a really effective posture, position, shape that transfers
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.360]   to handle these higher loads.
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.360]   So what do we do?
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.360]   We work on the range of motion.
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:49.160]   We give them skills to try to organize more effectively in that shape.
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:55.460]   And lo and behold, we can reduce injury risk and injury incident in those soldiers, right?
[00:07:55.460 --> 00:08:00.080]   So what we're always thinking about here is let's get away from good and bad and posture
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:01.320]   doesn't matter.
[00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:04.480]   And it also doesn't matter at low load, low speed.
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:06.880]   And I want to be very clear about that.
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:12.640]   So you can get away with murder at low velocities and low speeds, but speed kills.
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:14.000]   Oh, everyone's fine.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:20.320]   But when that speed wobble starts to happen, we start to see greater likelihood of deflection
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:21.560]   from posture.
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:23.440]   Your abs don't work as effectively.
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:26.240]   You can't create the same intra-abdominal pressure, right?
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.820]   Check, check, check, check, check.
[00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:32.660]   So that's why we always are saying, hey, is this true that you're saying under high load,
[00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:34.700]   high speed when there's consequence?
[00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:39.700]   Because maybe this set of conditions works under these conditions, but it doesn't work
[00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:40.940]   across all conditions.
[00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:45.720]   And for me, I'm trying to take the best information I have working in sports and performance and
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:49.500]   trying to transmute that to my family, transmute that to my neighborhood and to the kids I'm
[00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:58.300]   working with.
