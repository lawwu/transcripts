[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.460]   I noticed there was a discount for the hiking app AllTrails, and so I put that in the newsletter.
[00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:09.100]   But as I was reading the comments on Doctor of Credit, I noticed that everyone in the comments
[00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.980]   said, this is a terrible deal. Yes, AllTrails might normally be $50. Yes, it's on sale for $20.
[00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.220]   But don't forget that their pricing is country specific. So if you're currently traveling in
[00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:25.020]   India, you could get AllTrails for much less than $20. I think it was something like $5 or $6.
[00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.400]   And also, did you know that you can use a VPN to see that? And it just got me thinking,
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.720]   should I be using a VPN to basically not just sometimes price shop flights, which I've done in
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:40.940]   the past, but also to go and price shop anything I'm buying to see if the price is better? That's
[00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.780]   something I'm going to add to my routine of all of the things I do before I'm shopping online,
[00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.400]   because I thought it was pretty cool.
