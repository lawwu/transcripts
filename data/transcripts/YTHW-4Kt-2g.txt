[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.920]   Well, what's coming to America?
[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:14.680]   Can we anticipate widespread spiritual revival or should we expect a deepening social degeneracy?
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.600]   It's a question from a listener named Cole.
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.040]   "Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.440]   I'm a 21-year-old recent college graduate and I've noticed over the past few years among
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:29.920]   younger believers, especially in the college setting, a lot of encouraging talk of revival.
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.440]   Everyone seems to be expecting an awakening, that is, a lot of non-believers repenting
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.240]   and coming back to God.
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.360]   However, the more I read scripture, it seems like we should actually be expecting things
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.080]   in this world to get worse.
[00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:48.600]   There are so many instances in the Bible where it says that in those days there will be more
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.280]   egregious sins, even within the church and a lot of deceptive teaching and people walking
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.560]   away from the faith.
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.880]   Should we really be expecting revival and where did that notion come from or should
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.000]   we be expecting the number of believers to dwindle up until the coming of Christ?"
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.920]   Pastor John, what would you say to Cole?
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:20.160]   I surely do not want to in any way discourage prayer for and God-given expectation of a
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:30.680]   great move of God in our church, our denomination, our city, our ministries, our nation, or the
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.520]   world.
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:43.040]   But I want to provide a biblical orientation, perhaps, for how to think about such prayers
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.560]   and expectations.
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:51.520]   So I've got seven positions that I hold and I'll try to show that they're biblical, just
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.200]   briefly for you to think about, Cole.
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:03.160]   One, this age, until Christ returns to establish his kingdom, will draw to a close with an
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:10.200]   intensification of evil and a great outward rebellion against God.
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:18.400]   And the reason I say that is mainly because the Apostle Paul in 2 Thessalonians 2 says
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.940]   this, "Now concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered together
[00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:34.560]   to him, let no one deceive you in any way, for that day will not come unless the rebellion
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.560]   come first."
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.920]   And I think "rebellion" is the right translation there, as opposed to just kind of a gradual
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.560]   drifting away.
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.560]   Rebellion come first.
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:52.640]   "And the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of destruction, who opposes and exalts
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.880]   himself against every so-called God or object of worship, so that he takes his seat in the
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.400]   temple of God, proclaiming himself to be God.
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:10.120]   For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work; only he who restrains it will do
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:16.640]   so until he is out of the way, and then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:22.760]   Jesus will kill with the breath of his mouth and bring to nothing by the appearance of
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:23.760]   his coming."
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:31.980]   So my conclusion from that is a great rebellion and a singular figure of great arrogance claiming
[00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:41.760]   to be God will arise at the end of the age, and then the Lord comes and slays him by the
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.000]   sword of his mouth.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.500]   That's position number one.
[00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:53.680]   Number two, this time of intensified evil and rebellion is already happening in some
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.840]   measure in Paul's day.
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.760]   He says the mystery of lawlessness is already at work.
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.600]   There's a man of lawlessness coming, there's a great rebellion and lawlessness coming,
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:10.840]   but the mystery of lawlessness is already at work, or as John says in 1 John 2.18, "Children,
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.020]   it is the last hour."
[00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:18.840]   And as you have heard that Antichrist is coming, so now many Antichrists have come, therefore
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.640]   we know it is the last hour.
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.740]   So we have been living in the last hour for 2,000 years.
[00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.220]   That's the biblical perspective since the time of the apostles.
[00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:37.580]   But a final upsurge of lawlessness and rebellion, a man of lawlessness, is yet to come.
[00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:44.480]   Number three, there's no teaching in the Bible that I'm aware of which says that a great
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:54.020]   rebellion will come by a steady, irreversible decline of the church through history.
[00:04:54.020 --> 00:05:00.620]   So we have no authority for saying there can be no great revival.
[00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:10.100]   The gospel has advanced in the last 2,000 years in history mainly by great awakenings
[00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.340]   and great declines.
[00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.220]   And I just assume that's the way it's going to happen until Jesus comes.
[00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:23.420]   There will be seasons of remarkable awakening, and there will be seasons of sad decline.
[00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:30.140]   No teaching about a gradual worsening with no interrupted blessing.
[00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:40.620]   Number four, Jesus describes the progress of the gospel to all the nations in and through
[00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:49.040]   the very time when the love of many grows cold, which means that not all have grown
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:56.580]   cold at the end of the age, because it will not be cold people who take the gospel to
[00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.140]   the nations at the cost of their lives.
[00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:02.060]   So I'm getting all that from Matthew 24, 11 and following.
[00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:03.420]   Here's what it says.
[00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:07.780]   "Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and put you to death."
[00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:08.940]   This is Jesus talking.
[00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:13.280]   "And you will be hated by all nations for my name's sake.
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.380]   And because lawlessness will be increased."
[00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:20.540]   Now that sounds a lot like the man of lawlessness in that season of outbreak at the end, because
[00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:23.260]   lawlessness will be increased.
[00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:27.140]   The love of many will grow cold.
[00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:33.900]   But the one who endures to the endâ€”he's not going to be coldâ€”will be saved.
[00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:40.060]   And this gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the whole world as a testimony
[00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.700]   to all the nations, and then the end will come.
[00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:47.540]   That gospel proclaimed in the face of great tribulation is not going to be proclaimed
[00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:51.060]   by cold people, but white-hot people.
[00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:57.680]   So many may grow cold at the end, but not all, because only those with a passion for
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:03.260]   Jesus will endure to the end through martyrdom, required to finish the Great Commission, and
[00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:11.220]   therefore there will never be a time when the church is completely cold and ineffective.
[00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:18.100]   She rises with faith and passion and mission, and she declines in church history, but there's
[00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:27.420]   never a time when there are not people who are red-hot for God and pursuing his mission.
[00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:29.620]   Here's number five.
[00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:36.940]   Is there biblical warrant for knowing that a revival, a great revival, millions repenting
[00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:42.660]   and coming to Christ, a great purifying of the churchâ€”is there biblical warrant for
[00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:45.100]   believing that's going to happen?
[00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:49.820]   Can we expect this with biblical certainty?
[00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:54.980]   And my answer is, I don't know of any such promise in the Bible.
[00:07:54.980 --> 00:08:00.660]   The many promises, for example, in the Old Testament that all the nations will worship
[00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:07.620]   the Lord may simply refer to the time when Christ has established his kingdom in person
[00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:08.700]   on the earth.
[00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:15.140]   For example, Psalm 22, 27, "All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to the
[00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:21.180]   Lord, and all the families of the nations will worship before you, for kingship belongs
[00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:23.580]   to the Lord, and he rules over the nations."
[00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:27.500]   Amen, amen, come Lord Jesus, that's going to happen.
[00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:33.820]   I don't think we can assume that refers to a great revival on this side of the Second
[00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:35.260]   Coming.
[00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:41.340]   It certainly is an encouragement to press on with world evangelization, because Jesus
[00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:46.860]   underlined that promise, that people from every tribe and tongue and nation are going
[00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:53.140]   to be saved because they're bought with the blood of Jesus, Revelation 5, 9.
[00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:56.980]   You were slain, and by your blood you bought people from every tribe and tongue.
[00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:58.340]   They are going to worship.
[00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:03.380]   All of them, sooner or later, are going to worship the Lord.
[00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:13.580]   Six, there is one great awakening that we may expect, and that is a great turning of
[00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:18.660]   the Jewish people to the Messiah, Jesus.
[00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:22.780]   That's what Romans 11 promises.
[00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:30.140]   Romans 11, 15, "If the Jews' rejection means the reconciliation of the world, what
[00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:34.100]   will their acceptance mean but life from the dead?
[00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:41.060]   If the dough offered as firstfruits," that's Abraham and his people, "is holy, so is
[00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:46.320]   the lump," Jewish people as a whole, "and if the root is holy, so are the branches.
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:54.460]   Or even more clearly, if you," the Gentiles, "were cut from what is by nature a wild
[00:09:54.460 --> 00:10:00.220]   olive tree and grafted contrary to nature into a cultivated olive tree," that's
[00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:05.980]   the Abrahamic covenant, "how much more," here's the key sentence, "how much more
[00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:13.540]   will these," the natural branches, that is ethnic Judaism, "be grafted into their
[00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:15.080]   own olive tree?"
[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:23.100]   So that "much more," in my understanding, is a great movement of God in this world.
[00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:27.460]   And then he adds, "A partial hardening has come upon Israel until the fullness of
[00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:33.660]   the Gentiles comes in, and in this way all Israel will be saved," which I take to
[00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:41.300]   mean corporate Israel turns remarkably, amazingly, to their Messiah, Jesus.
[00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:42.580]   That is a great awakening.
[00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:46.900]   I think we should work toward, pray toward, and hope in.
[00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:51.140]   And lastly, number seven, so how should we live?
[00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:55.580]   Picture the endâ€”this is my conception, this is how I have done my ministry for the
[00:10:55.580 --> 00:11:03.460]   last 40 yearsâ€”picture the end coming like a glacier over the world, because it says
[00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:05.500]   the love of many will grow cold.
[00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:09.420]   It doesn't tell us how fast it's coming, it doesn't tell us whether it can come
[00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:12.220]   and recede, it's just coming like that.
[00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:14.080]   Matthew 24, 12.
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:22.020]   But there is no requirement, none, no biblical warrant, mandate, demand that your church
[00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:30.460]   or your city or even your people or nation be frozen by the glacier.
[00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:38.400]   Instead we should live by God's command for white hotness, not His providence.
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:45.820]   We don't live trying to sniff out God's providence, we live by the commands of Scripture,
[00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:49.260]   not His providence that brings cold on the earth.
[00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:57.780]   Who knows, but that you and your church could be among the wide awake white hot servants
[00:11:57.780 --> 00:11:58.780]   when Jesus comes.
[00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:04.140]   So my picture for ministry is wherever I'm speaking, wherever I'm living, wherever
[00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:07.640]   I'm pastoring, I'm going to torch the glacier.
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:13.280]   So if it looks like a glacier is coming over Minneapolis, I've got my torch, my torch
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:17.740]   of the Word of God, and I'm poking it, picture me now, poking it up into the glacier, and
[00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:19.960]   I'm melting big holes in the glacier.
[00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:25.040]   So the glory of God is shining through, and who knows, but that enough churches poking
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:32.440]   holes in the glacier would make your city a vibrant white hot witness being found faithful
[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:33.440]   when He comes.
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:34.440]   Amen.
[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:35.920]   That's very hopeful and hope-giving.
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:38.680]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:43.960]   Well it is not uncommon for us to get emails from listeners who are wearied by this life
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:49.160]   and who want to know if it's okay to anticipate death.
[00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:54.120]   Sometimes the thought of a world where suffering and pain is over is a hope so strong that
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:59.280]   we can feel inside of us a strong longing to be released from this life.
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:02.880]   It's such a desire, sinful.
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:06.640]   And at what point does that desire become a sinful desire for escape?
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:12.200]   It's a really tricky pastoral question, but that's what Pastor John is known for on this
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:16.360]   podcast, and that question is up next when we return on Monday.
[00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:17.360]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:18.200]   We'll see you then.
