[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.120]   We are launching this episode on Thanksgiving evening, so happy Thanksgiving.
[00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.260]   But you may be hearing this the day after Thanksgiving on Friday. In either case,
[00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:14.000]   we need to talk about giving gratitude to God for his abundant mercy to us in our lives and for his abundant
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.500]   promises to us. And the next question on the docket
[00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.980]   comes from Michael in Massachusetts.
[00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:24.040]   "Dear Pastor John, you speak a lot against the prosperity gospel, which I appreciate.
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:31.720]   However, there are texts such as Psalm 3527 which state that the Lord has "pleasure in the prosperity of his servant."
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.720]   That's from the KJV.
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.680]   When I try to encourage other believers,
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.660]   I will sometimes use verses like this one to show them that God has their best interest at heart, also like Romans 8 32 as well.
[00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:48.800]   Yet at times, I think they are hesitant to believe a verse like this because of our response to the heresy of the prosperity gospel.
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.000]   How can we properly and faithfully to the truth of the gospel
[00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.820]   comfort other believers using prosperity texts like this one in Psalm 35
[00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.900]   without then falling off the other side of the boat in light of a verse like Luke 12 15?
[00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.520]   What would you say, Pastor John, to Michael?"
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:14.160]   Well, I'm gonna get exactly at his question in Psalm 3527 in a minute, but
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.020]   let me start by saying in all my
[00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.000]   criticism of the so-called
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.440]   prosperity gospel, I
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:29.320]   don't wish for or pray for poverty on anyone. I don't wish for or
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:35.040]   pray for sickness on anyone. I don't wish for or pray for
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:41.920]   persecution or calamity on anyone. No one, I think, should make it his aim to suffer
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.600]   from poverty or sickness or calamity or persecution. Those are not
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:55.320]   the goals of life, and we rejoice when people are delivered from them into Christ-exalting
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.000]   well-being or what the Bible calls
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.840]   shalom.
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.160]   To be sure, we should be willing
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.160]   always to endure
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:11.680]   suffering or sickness or poverty for Christ. We should be ready to embrace it
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.400]   joyfully when God calls us to it as part of a larger vision.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.280]   But
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.080]   Jesus makes it very clear, seek the kingdom of God
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.400]   first, the hallowing of God's name, the pursuit of God's
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:34.680]   saving rule, the doing of God's holy will, the pursuit of purity, the
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:41.600]   glorifying of God's name, the rescue of the perishing, and loving our neighbors ourselves. These are the
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.040]   great, all-consuming
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:50.360]   goals of life. Whether we're rich or healthy or safe are
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.440]   secondary issues.
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.360]   Praying that God would give us our daily bread is
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.480]   subordinate, just our daily bread, let alone lots of bread, is
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:08.520]   subordinate to praying that his name would be hallowed and his kingdom would come. And God may will
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:15.200]   that we hallow his name through poverty and sickness and persecution and death.
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.520]   He has done that often for his people. He'll decide
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:27.160]   that. We won't make that choice for ourselves. And our job is to trust him in all of his
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:34.640]   providences and rejoice in the hope of the glory of God. So my issue with so-called
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.240]   prosperity gospel or teaching or churches is
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:45.440]   threefold, and I need to clarify this so that I can answer Michael's question about Psalm 35. One,
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.200]   the prosperity preaching tends to bring into this life
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.760]   greater expectation of
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.880]   prosperity than is intended for this life and only intended for the next life.
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.520]   It means crystal clear that in the next life, in the age to come,
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:07.120]   there will be no sickness, no poverty, no persecution, no calamity, no evil, no
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.480]   discouragement of any kind.
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:15.040]   In other words, the gospel does include health, wealth, and prosperity. It's coming.
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.320]   Namely, in the age to come when we are so spiritually
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:25.880]   mature and perfected that we're suited to enjoy these things to the full with no hint of
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.720]   idolatry. But
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.240]   prosperity preachers tend to
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:37.040]   bring this promise into the present in a way that is out of
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:44.960]   proportion with the way the New Testament describes the embattled position of the Christian in this fallen world.
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.160]   And it's
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.160]   it's not just
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.080]   prosperity preachers who make this mistake. I think it permeates
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:05:00.160]   most of the modern church. As far as my limited eyes can see, most of us, us,
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:08.280]   love this world too much and live in a compromised situation that does not
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.200]   comport
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:17.840]   with the wartime situation in which we find ourselves with millions of people perishing eternally and millions suffering in this life. And
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:23.680]   most of us using our resources to make ourselves more comfortable rather than relieve temporal and eternal
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:31.240]   suffering. So my first criticism of prosperity preaching cuts across most of Christianity, not just prosperity,
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.640]   preachers, and I don't elevate myself
[00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:39.320]   above that criticism. We all need great help and
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.680]   deliverance from
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:46.600]   the love of this world that John warns about in 1 John 2 15.
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:54.160]   My second problem with the prosperity churches is a lack of clear deep biblical teaching on the necessity of
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:01.120]   suffering in this life and the goodness of God in it and his control
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:07.160]   over it. Not just Satan, God's control over it and the benefits that may come
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:12.360]   from it that God decides we don't. It's a
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:19.640]   missing note, it seems to me, that gives the legitimate promises of God's earthly help a
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.640]   superficial ring because
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:26.920]   through many tribulations we must enter the kingdom. That was
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:30.200]   Discipleship 101 in Acts
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:35.240]   1422 as Paul taught the churches. The New Testament is
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:42.120]   replete with the teaching that nothing can separate us from the love of Christ including
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:46.520]   tribulation, persecution, famine, nakedness, danger, sword, even
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:51.040]   Paul says when we're being killed all day long in
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.800]   Romans 8 35. And
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.320]   right alongside
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:01.600]   those assurances that faithfulness will be accompanied by suffering
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:07.420]   are the promises of forgiveness and acceptance with God and peace and joy and hope that are worth
[00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:09.600]   10,000 times
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:15.560]   more than physical prosperity and health and safety in this life, which leads me now to my third
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.760]   difficulty with
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:25.660]   prosperity teaching and my answer to Michael's question, finally, about Psalm 37.
[00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:29.840]   All of this, everything I've said so far, I think tends
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:33.200]   to lead prosperity preachers
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.880]   to comfort people
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:42.040]   not with the presence of Christ in suffering and his rescue
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:45.440]   from suffering in the age to come
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.720]   but rather to comfort people with the assurance
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:56.480]   that they'll get out of suffering in this life if they follow the right prescription.
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:00.160]   I was just in what I would call a
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:05.440]   Prosperity Light Church last Sunday in Florida and
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:13.960]   the first thing that happened in that service, and there were thousands of people in the room and it was the second service,
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.800]   and by the way, the sermon was good.
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:23.160]   I mean, I was helped by this sermon.
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.120]   But the first thing that happened in
[00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:31.440]   that service was that the lead pastor stood up and made a case for
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:36.680]   tithing and that students shouldn't get into debt because then they can't tithe, and if they don't tithe,
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:39.840]   they're not going to experience God's blessing in their lives.
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:45.240]   And so the note struck from the beginning is that there's a strategy of
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:52.880]   getting God's material blessing in their lives, and that happens to be giving to this church enough to pay for this gigantic
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:58.240]   building, and I think that's really
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:02.800]   dangerous. Now, I think God does very often
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:08.360]   regularly bless people who give sacrificially in ways they could never imagine
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:12.560]   because he delights in cheerful givers and he loves Christ-like
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:15.000]   generous hearts.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.240]   But instead of attaching a sure material blessing
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:21.920]   to an act of tithing, I
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:26.160]   think we need to cultivate a love for Christ,
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.640]   for Christ,
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:36.200]   not his gifts, for Christ, that would tithe and double and triple and quadruple the tithe that God prospers
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:42.400]   even when the hoped-for physical blessing does not come, or even when there is no
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.880]   double and triple and quadruple tithes
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:47.840]   seemingly
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:50.920]   possible from a human standpoint. Paul says
[00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:56.360]   because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ, he counts everything,
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:59.200]   everything as loss.
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.480]   So,
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.560]   this is what Paul praises,
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:07.160]   it seems to me, about the Macedonians, which are an
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   unbelievably precious example of what I want to be, 2 Corinthians 8. In a severe test of affliction,
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:22.320]   their abundance of joy and their extreme poverty have overflowed in a wealth of generosity on their part.
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:30.640]   This is the joy that we should emphasize, the joy that flows from saving grace in spite of
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:33.960]   affliction, in spite of
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:40.720]   poverty. So Michael asks, "How can we help people feel that God has their best
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:45.040]   interest at heart?" Or to use the words of Psalm 35, 27,
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:53.000]   "How can we help people believe and enjoy the truth? Great is the Lord who delights in the welfare of
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.480]   his servant, all of his welfare." And
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:11:00.060]   surely the answer is—this is my
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:05.680]   answer, really, to Michael's question—surely the answer is
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:08.240]   walk with people through
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:10.920]   Romans chapter 8,
[00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:13.800]   memorizing it together
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:19.560]   because there is no greater chapter to prove that God is for us,
[00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:23.480]   100% for us, not 99%, and
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:31.000]   not against us, and no greater chapter to show that when he gave Christ for us,
[00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:37.640]   it was not to remove suffering in this life, but to assure us with
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:44.880]   unshakable joy and hope that in all our pain and in all our sorrow and frustration and disappointment,
[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:51.720]   nothing can separate us from the love of God in Christ. So my short answer to Michael is
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:54.640]   let Romans 8,
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:57.080]   perhaps the greatest chapter in the Bible,
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:00.040]   put Christian gladness and
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:05.240]   Christian groaning in their painful and precious
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:07.960]   relationship in this age.
[00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:13.520]   That's a wonderful perspective. Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you listeners for your attentiveness.
[00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:18.880]   We deeply appreciate your financial support and your prayers for us and for your
