[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.840]   When Jesus talks about fruitfulness, he is not afraid to throw around numbers,
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:14.280]   real numbers, numbers like 100 fold and 60 fold and 30 fold.
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.720]   So does this mean pastoring a small church that is not growing less fruitful
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.000]   than pastoring a large growing church?
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.920]   It's a question from a listener named Wilson, who is a discouraged pastor.
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.840]   Dear pastor, John, I was told by a seminary professor that to bear fruit
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.880]   is to reach an increasing number of souls with the gospel.
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.720]   I think he gets this from Matthew 13, 23.
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.960]   Basically, if you only serve a handful of people, a congregation of 40, for example,
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.000]   you're not bearing as much fruit as a larger church.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.200]   God is investing in you and seeing less significant fruit in return.
[00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.640]   He wants big fruit measured in the hundred folds.
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.920]   I believe many pastors, especially from small churches, struggle
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.560]   with the weight of this pressure.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.400]   What is the fruit that Jesus meant when he says bearing fruit?
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.240]   Is it number of converts?
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.440]   Is it personal holiness or repentance?
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.120]   And how did you define success and fruit in your own pastoral labors?
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:16.840]   Well, I sure want to be used by God at this moment to help the discouraged
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.640]   pastor keep his hand on the plow.
[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:27.160]   When John the Baptist comes in preparation for Jesus, one huge part of his
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.760]   message is bear fruit in keeping with repentance.
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.280]   Even now, the ax is laid to the root of the trees.
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:44.400]   Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.320]   And the crowds ask him, what should we do?
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.400]   And he answered, whoever has two tunics, share with him who has none.
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.440]   The tax collectors ask, what should we do?
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.760]   And he answers, collect no more than you're authorized to do.
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.120]   Soldiers ask, what should we do?
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.800]   And he says, don't extort money from anyone.
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:16.120]   In other words, what is completely clear is that bearing fruit in John the Baptist
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.800]   ministry, as he intends it, is a new kind of love.
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:27.520]   It's unselfish, it's loving, it's kind, it's sacrificial, it's generous, and it
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.960]   flows from a heart of repentance and trust in God.
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:38.040]   Now, Jesus picks up the same language, Matthew 12, and says, either make the tree
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.560]   good and its fruit good or make the tree bad and its fruit bad, for the tree is
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.560]   known by its fruit.
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.800]   You brood of vipers.
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.120]   How can you speak good when you are evil?
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.440]   The tree is evil.
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.800]   It's not going to bear good fruit for out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.320]   speaks.
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.800]   So the specific fruit that Jesus has in mind here is language coming out of the
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:08.960]   mouth that is loving or kind or honest or gracious or helpful or upbuilding rather
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:14.960]   than damning and condemning, putting people down.
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:20.560]   You will know them by their fruit means that there's an internal condition of the
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.880]   heart that expresses itself in outward words and actions.
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:32.200]   So fruit for Jesus at this point then is new kinds of words and actions that accord
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.920]   with faith and repentance.
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.720]   Then we come to John 15, which I think is probably the most important section on
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:40.840]   fruit.
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:47.800]   And he's using the imagery of fruit and the vine being grafted into the vine.
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:53.400]   And I think he's talking about a transformed life of sacrificial love, but
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:04:02.640]   probably also it flows over into people being influenced by this and coming to do it
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:03.760]   themselves.
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.480]   So here are the key verses.
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.920]   "I am the vine," this is verse 5, "I'm the vine, you are the branches.
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:16.920]   Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit for apart from me
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.240]   you can do nothing."
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:21.160]   So fruit is the opposite of nothing.
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:27.920]   In other words, fruit is everything we do which can only be done by the power of
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:35.240]   Christ, which would include our entire moral transformation by the power of the
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.840]   Spirit flowing through Christ and the effect it has on other people.
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:47.040]   And then he goes on in verse 8 and says, "By this is my Father glorified that you
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:52.200]   bear much fruit and so prove to be my disciples," which sounds a lot like
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.920]   Matthew 5:16, "Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:02.000]   deeds and give glory to your Father in heaven," which would incline me to think
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:09.040]   he has in mind here a real significant transformed, visible, new kind of behavior.
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.760]   And then he goes on and says, "Abide in my love.
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.440]   If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love."
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.440]   And then he adds in verse 12, "This is my commandment that you love one another
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:22.760]   as I have loved you.
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:27.200]   Greater love is no one than that he laid down his life for his friends."
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.880]   And the paragraph ends in verse 17, "These things I command you so that you
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.200]   will love one another."
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:42.640]   So, the very least we can say about the fruit that Jesus is saying will be
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:49.040]   produced by his disciples is that they love each other, that they love people,
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:55.520]   which I think is confirmed in verse 2 where it says, "Every branch in me that
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.920]   does not bear fruit, he takes away."
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:05.040]   In other words, love is absolutely essential to confirm that we are truly
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.600]   abiding in the vine, truly born again.
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:12.200]   And that's exactly what John says in his epistle, "By this we know that we have
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:16.600]   passed from death to life, that we love the brothers."
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:21.320]   And, of course, then we turn to the apostle Paul, we find almost the same
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:26.680]   kind of thing as he uses the imagery of fruit bearing over and over again,
[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:30.960]   and it's a transformed heart of love and joy and peace.
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:36.440]   For example, Galatians 5:22, "The fruit of the Spirit is joy, love, joy,
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:40.640]   peace," and Colossians 1:10, "Walk in a manner worthy of the Lord,
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.120]   bearing fruit in every good work."
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:48.640]   Philippians 1:11, "Be pure and blameless, fill with the fruit of righteousness."
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:56.400]   Ephesians 5:9, "The fruit of light is found in all that is good and right and true."
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:05.680]   Titus 3:4, "Let our people learn to devote themselves to good works so as to help in
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:09.880]   cases of need and not be unfruitful."
[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:15.280]   Now, to what degree this kind of faith-filled, self-denying,
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:22.480]   fruit-bearing love and good deeds will lead to the conversion of sinners and grow
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:28.040]   a big church is decisively in God's hands, not ours.
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.400]   We pray for this.
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:33.880]   Of course, we want this to happen, and we strive for this.
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.480]   This is God's intention.
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:40.360]   He says that others may see your good deeds and give glory to your Father.
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:46.280]   There is no artificial disconnection between our bearing the fruit of love and others being
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:51.800]   moved by it, changed by it, but they're not identical, and we don't have ultimate
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:55.840]   control over the response of other people.
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:02.720]   So, the decisive assessment of the success of our ministry, now this is Wilson's
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:10.880]   question, the decisive assessment of our success in ministry, that is, whether we have
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:17.280]   been faithful, is not determined by the number of our converts.
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:26.000]   What God will hold pastors accountable for, indeed, all of us, is have we fought the good
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   fight of faith?
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:34.480]   Have we put to death evil deeds in our own hearts and bodies by the power of the Spirit?
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:36.720]   Have we walked in love?
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:43.640]   Have we preached the Word with faithfulness and courage and without compromise?
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:49.920]   Have we maintained a life of earnest prayer for ourselves and for our people?
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:53.200]   Have we loved and pursued lost people?
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:58.680]   Have we been faithful with the ordinances of the church and with the right ordering
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.560]   of church discipline?
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:06.320]   Have we kept the global purposes of God in world missions and the Great Commission before
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:10.280]   us with concern and prayer and advocacy?
[00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:17.320]   Have we cared about suffering people inside, outside the church, and done what we could
[00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:20.560]   in acts of compassion and justice?
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:27.520]   These are the things that we should devote ourselves to because we can, by the power
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:29.520]   of the Spirit.
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:36.640]   For some, God blesses this faithfulness with many converts.
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:39.480]   For others, fewer.
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:47.260]   But the joy of the Lord will be our strength, and the triumph over sin and the loving of
[00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:53.200]   other people and faithfulness to God's Word rooted in the gospel.
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:55.640]   This will be our peace.
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:57.240]   Amen.
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:59.040]   Gospel-rooted peace in it all.
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.040]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:02.080]   And thank you, Wilson, for the question.
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.720]   And thanks for joining us on the podcast.

[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:21.960]   Well, speaking of things that Jesus said, the theme of the kingdom is a big one for
[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:22.960]   him.
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:28.080]   In the ESV translation, kingdom gets mentioned 126 times in the gospels, but just 34 times
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.360]   after that in the rest of the New Testament.
[00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:33.880]   So why does Jesus give the kingdom such prominence?
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.360]   And what is the kingdom of God to begin with?
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:39.040]   Two questions for the price of one APJ.
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:40.040]   That's on Friday.
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:41.040]   I'll be your host, Tony Reik.
