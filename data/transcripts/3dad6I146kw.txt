[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.700]   So, this Christmas was just past, really for the first time, I found myself watching multiple
[00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.760]   Hallmark and Netflix Christmas movies.
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.440]   This all transpired because I came across an interesting article written by the New
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.680]   York Times cultural critic, Amanda Hess.
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.620]   The article was titled, "How I Aged Into the Bad Christmas Movie."
[00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.960]   It was an interesting discussion which piqued my interest, so I decided to go watch some
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.320]   of these movies over the break.
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.460]   And what I want to argue today is that in watching these movies, I identified an unexpected
[00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.280]   but interesting connection to one of the major ideas we talked about on the show, an idea
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.220]   that is very relevant to the New Year season where we are right now.
[00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:43.220]   So let's start with this article.
[00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.900]   I'll pull it up on the screen here for those who are watching instead of just listening.
[00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:53.240]   Here is the article from the New York Times, "How I Aged Into the Bad Christmas Movie,"
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.100]   written by Amanda Hess.
[00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.820]   So I want to start for those who are, like I was until recently, uninitiated with these
[00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.260]   movies.
[00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.320]   What are they about?
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.960]   So I'm going to read from this article up here on the screen.
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:12.500]   This is Amanda Hess's summary of the typical Hallmark Christmas movie.
[00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.200]   So quote, "The protagonist will be a pastry chef or a gift wrap shop owner or a candy
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.620]   cane company CEO.
[00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.980]   She will acquire an Alaskan inn or she will inherit a Scottish castle or her flight will
[00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.180]   be diverted to a Christmas-themed town."
[00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:31.020]   By the way, Jesse, I watched both the Scottish castle movie and the flight being diverted
[00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.180]   to the Christmas-themed town.
[00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.420]   I saw both those movies.
[00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.940]   "She will become a recent widower.
[00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.260]   She will meet a recent widower."
[00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.660]   I feel a lot more dark if early in the movie she becomes a widower.
[00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.340]   "She will meet a recent widower or a handsome woodworker or a charming earl.
[00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.740]   His home will be aggressively bedecked with Christmas lights and decorative bowls of frosted
[00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:50.740]   pine cones.
[00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:51.740]   He'll wear a scarf.
[00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:52.740]   He'll wear another scarf.
[00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.060]   At some point he will gift the protagonist a seasonally appropriate necklace.
[00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.980]   Together they will be forced to put on a strudel fest or locate a missing antique nutcracker.
[00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.460]   In the end she will abandon her professional ambitions in order to join him in his small
[00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.740]   town or in a more recent plot reversal he will forgo his small town life to join her
[00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:10.740]   in the big city.
[00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.240]   It will snow and they will kiss."
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.020]   So that's kind of the plot of most of these movies.
[00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.820]   A few observations with my cinematic hat on.
[00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.740]   The production values are not great.
[00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.820]   I think at their worst they look very bad and at their best it's sort of network TV
[00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.020]   show quality.
[00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.420]   They're shooting fast and quick, like a Clint Eastwood movie.
[00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.380]   The writing is very bad in these movies, I will say that.
[00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.660]   No one's really caring much about the dialogue.
[00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.480]   The acting also tends to be very bad as well.
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.700]   No one really seems to care about this.
[00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.860]   The Netflix movies, they try to be more funny.
[00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.820]   They're like more ironic and then the Hallmark movies are much more earnest.
[00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.260]   And a lot of the Hallmark movies are on Netflix, so it's kind of confusing.
[00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.420]   All right, so why are these movies popular?
[00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:03.940]   Well, again, I'm going to go back to Amanda Hess explaining her conversion from someone
[00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.740]   cynical about these films into someone who grew to like them.
[00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:13.020]   So here's what Amanda said, "When I first discovered the existence of made-for-television
[00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.180]   Christmas movies maybe 15 years ago, they struck me as sentimental and anti-feminist.
[00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:24.700]   Recently, I have felt so pummeled by stress and responsibility that I have found it difficult
[00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.060]   to turn on a compelling new television show at the end of the day.
[00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.980]   I have no extra energy to expend familiarizing myself with unknown characters, deciphering
[00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.820]   twists or even absorbing scenes of visual interest.
[00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.580]   What I've been looking for instead is a totally uncompelling new television show, one that
[00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.940]   expects nothing from me and that gives me little in return.
[00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.740]   The bad Christmas movies' beats are so consistent, its twists so predictable, its actors and
[00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.260]   props so loyally reused.
[00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.740]   It's easy to relax drowsily into its rhythms.
[00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.580]   The genre is formulaic, which makes for a kind of tradition.
[00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.820]   Now it plays through the winter like a crackling fireplace in my living room.
[00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.460]   This is clearly a big part of the appeal.
[00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.380]   You watch for six weeks or so.
[00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:06.380]   It's traditional.
[00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.380]   It's escape."
[00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.220]   So, look, you wouldn't be able to keep this up for a full year because these movies aren't
[00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.220]   very good.
[00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.020]   But this idea, she's saying that it's something that you look forward to in the season.
[00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:17.260]   It's supposed to be corny.
[00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.380]   It doesn't make much demands from you.
[00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.380]   That makes sense.
[00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.920]   She then, Amanda then elaborated in a podcast I listened to, she did a daily episode.
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.060]   She talked about this article and she elaborated the, she was pummeled by stress and responsibility
[00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.980]   in part because a friend had gotten a potentially very scary medical diagnosis and they were
[00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:39.620]   sort of fearing the worst that it ended up okay, but it was a stressful time.
[00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.220]   So you can kind of set that context.
[00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.220]   All right.
[00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.300]   That's what these movies are.
[00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.100]   That is why Amanda Hess came around to them.
[00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:52.260]   What I want to add today is that I think there is another reason for the appeal of these
[00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:57.380]   movies, especially to people of our generation, that is not only relevant to us, but underscores
[00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.460]   one of the big lessons we talk about on this show.
[00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.780]   So what is this hidden lesson in these movies?
[00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.500]   Well, look, there's this funny SNL skit.
[00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:11.660]   I remembered it vaguely and I found it earlier today, it was from five years ago, that made
[00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:18.220]   fun of Hallmark movies and it set up was, it was a dating game where the, it was the
[00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.500]   sort of the female protagonist and dating the sort of classic characters from these
[00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:27.320]   movies and the dating game was titled A Winter Boyfriend for Holiday Christmas.
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:33.620]   And toward the end, the host named Emily Kringle delivers sort of the joke line, the true reason
[00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.180]   for Christmas is husband.
[00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:41.800]   And I think that matches a curve of common misunderstanding about these movies that they're
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:47.220]   basically visual romance novels where the thrill is in imagining sort of finding true
[00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.500]   love and giving up everything for it.
[00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.420]   This was sort of the original understanding that led Amanda Hess to think like, hey, these
[00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.260]   movies are anti-feminist.
[00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:59.620]   I want to argue for millennial viewers, this is not why these movies are largely appealing.
[00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:03.900]   A lot of these viewers already are married, already have families.
[00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:09.660]   It's not the, the fantasy of the Christmas tree lot owner that captures them.
[00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:14.820]   The real value I think these movies have, the real aspiration is in their portrayal
[00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.340]   of lifestyle centric planning.
[00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:21.780]   So yes, Jesse, I brought this all back to my favorite deep life topic, lifestyle centric
[00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:22.780]   planning.
[00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:23.780]   All right, so hear me out.
[00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:28.860]   The most common plot for these movies, think about this, is a lead that has a stressful
[00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:32.140]   job in the big city.
[00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:38.600]   They end up in a small town where they do not have the stresses of that job.
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.100]   They connect with the community, which tends to be like tightly knit around.
[00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.540]   They all are coming together around a holiday.
[00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:50.280]   The holiday itself gives them exposure to sort of escapism and fantasy.
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:54.780]   The town is beautifully lit up and they just sort of appreciate the way it looks.
[00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:57.820]   They appreciate the people in the town.
[00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.820]   The pace is slower.
[00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:01.700]   The days are unpredictable.
[00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:03.020]   There's adventure going on.
[00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:07.020]   They're hunting down an antique nutcracker, trying to put on the strudel fest.
[00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:11.900]   The escapism in here, therefore, is not, hey, maybe I can find a husband who owns a Christmas
[00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:15.940]   tree farm, but instead the idea that you might be able to reduce your work hours, spend more
[00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:20.780]   time outside, walk down the street through the snow to the coffee shop that has the quirky
[00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:25.800]   owner who knows you and get lost that evening in some like town tradition or they like light
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:31.360]   up the tree in a way that is really over the top attractive.
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:36.480]   So one way to recast these movies then is the struggle between two approaches to trying
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:38.060]   to cultivate a meaningful life.
[00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:42.540]   The protagonists at the beginning of these movies are often implicitly deploying what
[00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:48.220]   here on the show we call the grand goal strategy, which is where you pursue a single big and
[00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:52.180]   impressive goal that you hope will make everything in your life good.
[00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:53.180]   Right?
[00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:57.620]   So in the movies, as it is for many people, that ambitious goal is usually some sort of
[00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:59.340]   focused, impressive professional goal.
[00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:06.440]   They're trying to get the CEO slot there, whatever it is, it's the big city job ambition.
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:10.560]   By the end, the protagonist has found happiness deploying something more like the lifestyle
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:16.720]   centric approach in which it's not a singular goal that's going to make their life better,
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:20.300]   but they're identifying the properties of an ideal lifestyle and then finding ways to
[00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:21.440]   move closer to it.
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:25.440]   And then so often what they are discovering is that this new life that is presented to
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:31.440]   them in the town, which is usually called like Jingle Bell City or something, this new
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:34.600]   life hits a lot of beats of a lifestyle that's more attractive.
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:37.960]   So there's no one thing about the new lifestyle.
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:46.120]   They realize a lifestyle that day to day resonates, has more value than the pursuit and accomplishment
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.580]   of a single grand goal.
[00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:53.600]   So let's recap then lifestyle centric planning since these movies are implicitly endorsing
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:54.600]   it.
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.920]   So let's see how this actually works.
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:01.360]   To do lifestyle centric planning, you begin by imagining a typical day, like what it's
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.360]   like, it's rhythms.
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:03.360]   It's not specific.
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.320]   I'm in this town, I have this job, but what's it like?
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:06.560]   Are you walking to the coffee store?
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:09.040]   Are you going through a trail walk through the woods?
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:12.040]   Are you in a busy city and you're, it's like this really active scene.
[00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:14.000]   You kind of get a sense of like, what are the rhythms?
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.320]   How does this resonate?
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:18.400]   You use specific imagery that also resonates.
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.320]   You imagine yourself in this scene or that scene.
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:24.440]   You're really playing with these internal resonance, trying to imagine sort of like
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.880]   a day in an ideal lifestyle.
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:32.200]   You then identify and isolate the properties that make these images, that make these scenes
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.200]   resonate.
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:39.060]   So what is it about the sort of day I've constructed in my head that makes it resonate so much
[00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:40.560]   for me?
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:44.360]   You can then survey your full landscape of opportunities and obstacles to figure out
[00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.940]   what's your best bet for moving towards those properties in your life.
[00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:49.200]   And it's here where like really interesting options come up.
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:53.840]   I'm just giving all the obstacles I have and opportunities I have, how can I move closer
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:55.380]   to these particular properties?
[00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:58.080]   You're able to explore a wider range of options.
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.360]   Would you do this with my job?
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.640]   I move this work to this work.
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:01.640]   We move here.
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:02.640]   I start doing this.
[00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:07.280]   If I, if I move this over here, if we, you begin to come up with these interesting configurations,
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:11.120]   which you probably never would have thought of from scratch.
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:15.020]   It's not necessarily like, oh, here's the obvious big thing to do.
[00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:20.400]   But it ends up in the end having the effect of making your lifestyle overall more congruent
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:23.220]   with things that actually resonate.
[00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:29.460]   So I think that's what, that's one of the true messages of these movies.
[00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:30.460]   Lifestyle centric planning.
[00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:36.160]   They're happy because in the end, they better aligned your lifestyle with stuff that matters.
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:43.920]   And I've realized that the pursuit of the singular grand goal wasn't making them happy.
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:47.300]   And so we're seeing, I think millennials in particular, because they're at that stage
[00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:50.600]   of life are saying, huh, there's something here.
[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:55.380]   And so that's where I think we have our hidden value of these movies.
[00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:56.640]   Hey, it's Cal.
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:01.140]   I wanted to interrupt briefly to say that if you're enjoying this video, then you need
[00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:08.600]   to check out my new book, Slow Productivity, The Lost Art of Accomplishment Without Burnout.
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:14.040]   This is like the Bible for most of the ideas we talk about here in these videos.
[00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:19.400]   You can get a free excerpt at calnewport.com/slow.
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:21.200]   I know you're going to like it.
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.200]   Check it out.
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:24.340]   Now let's get back to the video.
[00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:27.460]   So yes, you know, somehow in the end, as I always do, I've made the leap from Hallmark
[00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:31.600]   movies to lifestyle centric planning, like one of my, one of my favorite topics.
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:35.560]   And as I always argue, all this stuff comes back to the modern digital landscape of the
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.360]   modern digital environment one way or the other.
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:41.800]   And one of the reasons why lifestyle centric planning is so important is because in our
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:46.240]   current digital environment, work has become more abstract.
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:52.040]   It's moving symbols around on a screen, so it's much less able to sort of directly provide
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:54.560]   us a sense of concrete meaning.
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:56.800]   Work can follow us everywhere.
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:00.240]   So these sort of modern symbolic knowledge jobs now have the way of sort of infusing
[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:04.760]   more and more of our life and therefore bleaching from those parts of our lives are things that
[00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:05.760]   are meaningful.
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:07.040]   So this helps create a meaning crisis.
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:09.640]   So we have that going on.
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:13.960]   We also have all of this sort of electronic distraction that subverts our deeper instincts
[00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:14.960]   for meaning.
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:21.720]   So when we feel connection and wonder and all this type of stuff, we get a very attenuated
[00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:23.640]   form of this through social media in our form.
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:27.200]   I'm kind of like talking to people on Twitter or I'm seeing these TikToks that are kind
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:30.560]   of pressing the button of like, "Whoa, that was kind of cool to see."
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:34.200]   And it subverts those instincts just enough that the drive doesn't push us to actually
[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.720]   like change our lives in meaningful ways to get there.
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:42.380]   So the modern digital environment did help set up this sort of meaning crisis that we
[00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:43.560]   have right now.
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:45.760]   It also opens up new opportunities.
[00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:49.880]   That abstract work that persists as sort of you're just on a screen moving symbols can
[00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:50.880]   be pretty portable.
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:52.400]   It can give you a lot of autonomy.
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:58.840]   It's something that's compatible with a much greater variety of day-to-day lifestyles than
[00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:02.040]   maybe work would have been 40 years ago, where it's like, where's your office building?
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:05.660]   You need to be within 10 miles and that's just what your day is going to be.
[00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:09.480]   So all of this comes back to the modern digital environment, but that's the lesson I think
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:10.480]   is there.
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:13.540]   So I've connected Hallmark movies to email and social media because I always find a way
[00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:14.680]   to do that.
[00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:18.240]   So I would say my work here is done.
[00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:19.240]   So I don't know.
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.720]   Have you ever seen these movies, Jesse?
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:21.720]   Yeah.
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:22.720]   A long time ago, though.
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:23.720]   A long time ago.
[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:24.720]   Yeah.
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:25.720]   I watched several.
[00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:30.600]   I would say my, I think the best example this year of this year's crop that kind of hit
[00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:37.640]   my theory and just the best production values was Christmas Island, which has a no-nonsense
[00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:42.280]   plot, a very ambitious young pilot.
[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:46.780]   And this doesn't quite track if you look at the plot line.
[00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:51.720]   This very ambitious young pilot, she wants to be a very successful pilot, but she's flying
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:56.960]   just the regional routes and gets hired to be a pilot of a private plane for like a rich
[00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:57.960]   couple.
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:03.280]   Now, for some reason, the first flight she's given on the private plane is LA to Switzerland.
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:06.800]   So she's been doing regional flights and now she's flying for LA to Switzerland, whatever.
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:11.960]   As things go, the flight gets diverted to Christmas Island, which is like a small island
[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:15.360]   off the coast of Canada that's really into Christmas.
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:19.080]   And the air traffic controller that was sort of snippy with her while she was in the air
[00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:23.440]   also for some reason lives on Christmas Island.
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:28.480]   Classic movie, you know, ends up falling in love with Christmas and becoming less blah,
[00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:29.480]   blah, blah.
[00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.480]   But I liked it.
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:35.320]   It had good scenes of the island and they had a really good decorated downtown.
[00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:38.080]   It often comes to like how Christmassy they can decorate the sets.
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:39.080]   So that was a good one.
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:48.560]   I watched another one where they were in Ireland maybe or Scotland and Scott Wolfe and Lucy
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:52.760]   was her name, who were both in Party of Five, are like the siblings and they find out their
[00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:56.720]   mom I guess owns a castle or something.
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:00.160]   But they have a newspaper clip.
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:01.160]   These are things I noticed.
[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:05.200]   They have a newspaper clip of the mom being born.
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:10.520]   It was like 1963, right, mom, you know, Duke has a baby or something.
[00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:13.800]   They show that clip because I guess the actress liked the idea of like whatever age that was
[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:15.000]   she wanted to be.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.520]   The problem is Scott Wolfe is playing her son and Scott Wolfe was born in like 1967.
[00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:24.000]   So like for this to actually work, she would have had to been five years old when she had
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   Scott Wolfe.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.280]   I think that's more Scott Wolfe trying to play 20 years younger than the mom trying
[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:29.280]   to play too young.
[00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:32.160]   Anyways, I don't think I'll be watching a lot of these movies now that we're in the
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:36.480]   new year, but I think that's what's going on, lifestyle-centric planning captured in
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:37.480]   a movie.
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:40.800]   I did see the red one on Amazon Prime with The Rock.
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.480]   Who is that movie for?
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:48.120]   A PG-13 Santa movie.
[00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:49.120]   Who is it for?
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:50.120]   That's a good question.
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:51.680]   It's like a Santa movie with cursing.
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:54.560]   Oh, because they're usually PG?
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:59.040]   Yeah, because, you know, it seems like it's aimed more like a teenage crowd, but teenagers
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:00.440]   don't want to watch a Santa movie.
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:02.960]   And was it good?
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:03.960]   It was entertaining.
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:04.960]   Yeah.
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:05.960]   I'm glad I watched it.
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:06.960]   All right.
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:07.960]   I might watch it.
[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:08.960]   I watched Carry On.
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:09.960]   That was another good new one.
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:10.960]   Jason Bateman.
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:11.960]   Oh, that was horrible.
[00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:12.960]   I couldn't stand it.
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:13.960]   You didn't like it?
[00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:14.960]   Yeah.
[00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:16.280]   I mean, let's say the plot didn't completely check out.
[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:18.120]   It didn't completely check out.
[00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:19.120]   You liked that movie?
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:20.120]   It was fun.
[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:25.240]   I didn't completely understand the plan, but it was good.
[00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:26.240]   It was fun.
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:27.240]   They spent some money on that.
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:28.240]   They filmed at the airport.
[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:29.960]   Have you seen the new Dylan movie?
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:30.960]   Not yet.
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:31.960]   Yeah.
[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:32.960]   I do.
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:33.960]   I do want to see that, though.
[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:35.920]   A Complete Unknown.
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:40.080]   It won't hold a candle in an Oscar competition perspective, probably.
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:45.320]   A Complete Unknown will probably struggle to beat out, for best picture, Christmas Island,
[00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:47.440]   which I think is going to make a big push.
[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:48.440]   All right.
[00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:49.440]   Enough of that.
[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:55.480]   We've got cool questions, but first, let's hear from a sponsor.
[00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:56.480]   So here we are.
[00:16:56.480 --> 00:17:01.880]   It's 2025, and you're probably thinking, "How am I going to make this year different?
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:08.520]   What am I going to do to move closer to my ideal lifestyle?"
[00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:11.320]   Maybe you're dying to be your own boss, or you have some business idea that you want
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:12.720]   to get up and running.
[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:17.760]   This is the time to make it into reality, but you don't know how to get started.
[00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:23.960]   Let's get Shopify involved, because it could help you make this happen.
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:27.440]   The best time to start your new business is right now, and Shopify will make it simple
[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:31.640]   to create your brand, open your business, and get that first sale, so you can focus

[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:39.840]   getting that stuff to your customers and getting money back in return.
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:43.560]   So you can get your store up and running easily with thousands of customizable templates.
[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:46.400]   You have no coding needed, no design skills required.
[00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.160]   All you're doing is drag and dropping.
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:52.040]   Their powerful social media tools let you connect to all your channels and create shoppable
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:56.120]   posts and help you sell everywhere that people are scrolling.
[00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:58.120]   Shopify makes it easy to manage your growing business.
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:02.200]   They help with the details like shipping, like taxes, like payments, all from one single
[00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:07.960]   dashboard, allowing you to focus on the important stuff, like growing your business.
[00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:08.960]   What happens if you don't act now?
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:09.960]   Will you regret it?
[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:11.440]   What if someone beats you to your ideas?
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:15.320]   Don't kick yourself when you hear this again in a year because you didn't do anything.
[00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:16.920]   Take action now.
[00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:21.160]   Shopify will handle the details for you, so you can get focused on actually doing the
[00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:23.520]   thing you do best.
[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:26.440]   With Shopify, your first sale is closer than you think.
[00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:31.660]   So I think established in 2025 has a nice ring to it.
[00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:36.400]   So sign up for your $1 per month trial at shopify.com/deep.
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:44.080]   Type that in all lowercase, that's shopify.com/deep to start selling with Shopify today, shopify.com/deep.
[00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:51.840]   I also want to talk about our friends at Element LMNT, a zero sugar electrolyte drink mix and
[00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:55.720]   sparkling electrolyte water born from the growing body of research revealing that optimal
[00:18:55.720 --> 00:19:01.400]   health outcomes occur at sodium levels two to three times government recommendations.
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:05.520]   You can either get the stick pack, so it's a stick of powder you add to your water bottle,
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:10.320]   or you can get the can of sparkling water that already has electrolytes in it, so you
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:14.920]   can grab it cold straight from the fridge to get meaningful doses of electrolytes.
[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:20.720]   Why I like LMNT is that it is free of sugar, it is free of artificial colors, or other
[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:21.720]   dodgy ingredients.
[00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:24.100]   I never feel bad about using it.
[00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:26.320]   Don't let winter trick you.
[00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:30.260]   You get just as dehydrated, if not more, in the dry air of winter than you do in sort
[00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:36.080]   of the wet heat of summer when you're talking all day on Zoom in a meeting in that dry room,
[00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:39.460]   when you're out shoveling snow, when you're doing your normal exercise, but it's incredibly
[00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:40.520]   dry out there.
[00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:45.960]   You just don't realize you're as dehydrated because you don't feel that typical cues of
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:46.960]   heat, but you do.
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:49.440]   And the best way to get hydrated again is with LMNT.
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:50.440]   I use the stick packs.
[00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:51.480]   I have a big box of it.
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:52.760]   We keep it in the kitchen.
[00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:54.960]   I'll have it in the morning if I wake up dehydrated.
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:59.440]   I'll have it after working out, and I'll do it after a long day of podcasting or lecturing.
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:04.240]   I want to mention briefly they have the new LMNT chocolate medley that includes chocolate
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:08.840]   mint, chocolate chai, and chocolate raspberry, which you can enjoy hot.
[00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:14.600]   So if you're been outside exercising, add some to some hot water to both warm up and
[00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:16.800]   hydrate at the same time.
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:18.920]   I have a nice offer here.
[00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:22.360]   You'll receive a free element sample pack with any order.
[00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:30.960]   When you purchase through the URL drinkelement.com/deep, that's drinkelementlmnt.com/deep to get that
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:33.420]   free sample pack with any orders.
[00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:38.720]   And keep in mind that their LMNT is a no questions asked refund policy.
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:39.720]   It's totally risk-free.
[00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:42.120]   If you don't like it, give it away to a salting friend, and they'll give you your money back.
[00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:43.940]   No questions asked.
[00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:44.940]   That's drinkelement.com/deep.
[00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:50.620]   All right, Jesse, let's do some questions.
[00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:51.860]   First question's from Michael.
[00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:55.980]   I just finished reading Where Good Ideas Come From by Steven Johnson.
[00:20:55.980 --> 00:21:00.760]   Johnson talks about the Commonplace book, a notebook to record interesting ideas.
[00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:04.140]   The idea is that you can revisit this book to examine incomplete ideas.
[00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:05.820]   Does Cal keep a Commonplace book?
[00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:08.380]   And if so, what form does it take?
[00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:09.380]   I like Steven.
[00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:14.660]   Actually, I was trading emails with him not that long ago.
[00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:18.300]   Cool writer, one of that like original idea writers who came up in the '90s and early
[00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:21.100]   2000s, and written a lot of cool books.
[00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:29.540]   Okay, so Steven, if I remember, was really early to these ideas of using technology to
[00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:31.860]   help manage partial ideas.
[00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:37.300]   He was big on a tool called DevinThink that you could enter in ideas and it would help
[00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:38.780]   make connections.
[00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:42.580]   I think that's now since been more subsumed by these Zettelkasten-specific techniques
[00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:47.140]   that are all about storing ideas even when you don't know what to do with them in a way
[00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:51.620]   that like connections can be formed and excavated, and the tool can work with your ideas to help
[00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:52.620]   you come up with new connections.
[00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:54.060]   He was really excited about that.
[00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:58.140]   Right now, a lot of other people are excited about that as well.
[00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:03.580]   I don't tend to do that, so I don't keep any sort of digital equivalent of a commonplace
[00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:05.900]   book, at least with that type of rigor.
[00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:11.860]   My problem is not coming up with an idea when it comes to writing.
[00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:14.800]   It's having too many ideas, right?
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:17.580]   It takes a long time to write something.
[00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:21.700]   There's only so many things I can write, and the limiting factor is almost always time
[00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:25.340]   to write for me, not scarcity of ideas.
[00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:30.060]   So I actually tend to just use my brain as a commonplace book, informally speaking.
[00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:31.060]   I read lots of stuff.
[00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:32.060]   I talk to lots of people.
[00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:34.180]   I listen to lots of stuff.
[00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:38.580]   What I look for, for ideas, is something that becomes insistent.
[00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:40.180]   It kind of sticks around in my mind.
[00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:42.620]   I'm using my brain as its own informal filter.
[00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:47.460]   An idea really sticks around in my mind, and it keeps coming back, and I'm like, "Yeah,
[00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:48.460]   I like that.
[00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:51.980]   Oh, I just heard this new thing that supports what I was thinking about before.
[00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:53.660]   Oh, listen to that interview over there.
[00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:55.220]   My idea would be very relevant there."
[00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:59.500]   If an idea has really stuck around, then that's usually when I'll write about it.
[00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:03.140]   Now once I'm writing on an idea, like, "Okay, I'm going to do an article on this.
[00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:07.300]   I'm going to write a book chapter on this," then I start collecting information systematically.
[00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:13.780]   I typically just put that right into the Scrivener project I'm using for that particular writing
[00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:14.780]   objective.
[00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:16.100]   So I don't have a separate system.
[00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:20.140]   If I'm writing an article, the research folder of the Scrivener project for that article
[00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:25.100]   is where I'll start throwing any sort of ideas I have, any sort of links, clips, movies.
[00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:28.740]   So once I'm specifically working on something, I do collect everything, but not in a highly
[00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:29.740]   structured way.
[00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:31.120]   I just throw them all into some folder.
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:35.300]   So I lean more into my mind's informal ability to sort through ideas.
[00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:41.740]   I lean into that quite a bit and don't really use outside structures to help me structure
[00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:42.740]   my information.
[00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:43.740]   Steven Johnson.
[00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:48.100]   He had an op-ed in The New York Times this morning.
[00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:49.100]   Oh, he did?
[00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:50.100]   Yeah.
[00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:51.100]   All right.
[00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:52.100]   Let's go.
[00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:53.100]   All right.
[00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:54.100]   Who we got next?
[00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:55.100]   Next question is from Mark.
[00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:56.100]   "I'm looking for some advice on a weekly template.
[00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:59.440]   I'm a high school teacher and need to set aside time for prep.
[00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:02.700]   I'm also learning web design with a view to starting a side business.
[00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:06.340]   I train in the gym three times per week and run two times per week.
[00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:08.700]   I train in the gym in the mornings before school.
[00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:11.940]   At the moment, I get some school prep done at school, but most in the evenings.
[00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:14.540]   I would like to use the mornings more for cognitive work."
[00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:18.540]   Well, let's just remember real quick what's meant by a weekly template.
[00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:21.900]   We talked about this earlier in the fall in an episode.
[00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:27.900]   So a weekly template is where you've set aside certain times of the week to sort of work
[00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:30.660]   on certain things on a regular basis.
[00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:34.780]   So when you make your weekly plan for a week, you apply the template first.
[00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:35.780]   Oh, yeah.
[00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:37.260]   Monday mornings, I always work on this.
[00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:39.220]   I always go to the gym in the afternoons.
[00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:41.520]   On Thursdays afternoons is when I work on this.
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:44.960]   So when you're making your weekly plan, you start with that template, then you can fill
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:45.960]   in the rest.
[00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:49.440]   You can add some regularity to your work, and I always argue if you have stuff you're
[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:54.560]   going to do on a regular basis, have a weekly template, and then that can change season
[00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:55.560]   to season.
[00:24:55.560 --> 00:25:02.800]   I change my weekly template every semester because depending on my teaching schedule,
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:06.340]   the days and times I want to do certain work is going to change.
[00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:13.560]   I'm constructing a weekly template now for the upcoming spring/winter semester.
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:18.980]   The good thing about designing a weekly template is that it forces you to use terminology from
[00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:22.140]   earlier in the show to face the productivity dragon.
[00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:24.980]   That's the situation I think Mark is in.
[00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:27.040]   Mark says, "I want to learn web design.
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:28.980]   I want to start a side business.
[00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:30.620]   I want to train at the gym.
[00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:35.100]   I want to run and have a bunch of prep to do."
[00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:39.720]   Setting up a weekly template for all those regular occurring activities will help you
[00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:41.960]   figure out, is it even possible?
[00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:42.960]   Time is time.
[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:46.820]   You might as well go through this exercise of, where am I going to actually make this
[00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:47.820]   happen?
[00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:52.300]   If you're hitting up against hard constraints, like, "I really don't have enough time.
[00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:56.580]   So much of my day is spent in the classroom, and then prepping takes a lot of time, and
[00:25:56.580 --> 00:26:00.620]   I'm not just seeing enough time unless I wake up at four in the morning," that's an important
[00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:01.620]   signal.
[00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:02.620]   Time is time, and you don't have it.
[00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:04.980]   Some sort of change has to be made.
[00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:08.580]   Maybe that change is dropping something from this ambition, or it's alternation, or it's
[00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:14.380]   finding a way to mix cardio with strength training in a more intense way, or whatever
[00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:15.380]   it is.
[00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:19.380]   It might look different or be more effective about prep.
[00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:24.220]   The time is time, and that signal is going to force you to be sort of innovative.
[00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:30.940]   So I can't tell you a specific template because I don't know your exact details of your schedule.
[00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:35.100]   But I think coming up with the template is important because it's a way for you to actually
[00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:37.680]   just move your time around like chess pieces.
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:42.580]   If you were just going to take each day as it came, say, "What do I want to work on today?"
[00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:45.380]   Just imagine how much less you would get done.
[00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:48.980]   You would have such a lower probability of actually fitting these various things into
[00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:49.980]   your life.
[00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:54.560]   So the weekly template, we can see in examples like this, is really important for figuring
[00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:59.420]   out the puzzle that is your week and can be really important as a reality check.
[00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:01.260]   I mean, I'm just starting that now.
[00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:04.900]   I mean, we're recording this on the, what, January 2nd.
[00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:08.200]   And so I have like a week until the semester starts.
[00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:13.080]   So I'm working on my weekly template now, Monday-Wednesday teaching.
[00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:14.080]   And so I'll work around.
[00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:16.540]   Like, I'm doing Monday-Wednesday teaching.
[00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:20.620]   I'm probably going to use the space in between the classes as office hours.
[00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:22.900]   Like, I'm trying to, like, piece together.
[00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:27.940]   And then, like, what day we're going to podcast and versus, like, what days—I often like
[00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:31.980]   to have a meeting afternoon on my weekly template, on-campus meeting afternoon.
[00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:34.780]   Like, I'm still trying to figure out where that's all going to fit.
[00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:41.660]   In terms of, Mike, in terms of the question in terms of cognitive work in the mornings
[00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:47.020]   and going to the gym in the mornings, do you think that working out in the afternoon would
[00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:48.780]   be better than doing all this stuff in the morning?
[00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:51.420]   I think more people should work out in the afternoon, yeah.
[00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:56.580]   I think for most people, the natural rhythm, all things being equal, cognitive work in
[00:27:56.580 --> 00:28:00.380]   the morning, exercise is a transition from work to non-work.
[00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:05.500]   That might not be logistically possible for everyone, but just from, like, a physiological
[00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:10.460]   standpoint, I would say for probably the majority of people, that's best.
[00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:14.180]   Get up—I mean, you could stretch or do some things in the morning, but take advantage
[00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:19.700]   of, like, that first rush of coffee and have good thoughts.
[00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:22.100]   And then, like, serious exercise, use that to transition.
[00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:23.820]   I mean, that's what I try to do.
[00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:25.260]   I think that works well for a lot of people.
[00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:28.020]   Some people really do swear by, like, the early-morning run.
[00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:32.620]   But cognitive work in the afternoon is hard for a lot of people.
[00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:36.780]   I mean, when you hear about writers who are night owls, the reality is typically what
[00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:43.500]   they mean is not 4 o'clock, but, you know, 10 p.m. to 3 a.m. or something like that,
[00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:46.780]   where they find this, like, completely blank bit of time.
[00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:51.540]   But for most people, afternoon's hard, early evening—I sometimes do early evening writing
[00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:52.540]   sessions.
[00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:56.460]   I call them happy hour sessions because it falls, like, in the time that you would normally
[00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:59.260]   have happy hour at a bar, and it sometimes works.
[00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:04.900]   I'll often come here to the HQ so that it's, like, a definitive break from, you know, home.
[00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:05.900]   It feels different.
[00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:06.900]   I work.
[00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:07.900]   I'm done.
[00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:08.900]   I come home.
[00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:09.900]   And I'll use that sometimes.
[00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:10.900]   But it's always a stretch.
[00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:13.580]   It's always much harder than just coming over in the morning and writing.
[00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:16.280]   What do we got?
[00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:17.280]   Next question's from Gonzalo.
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:22.180]   "Are the five books you read every month separate from the reading you do for book and article
[00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:23.180]   research?"
[00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:25.240]   Yeah, it's a good question.
[00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:30.440]   If I finish a book—I read a book in its entirety—I will count it on my list of books
[00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:32.400]   read.
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:38.160]   So you will see, you'll notice—the astute listener will notice—that in my monthly
[00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:42.640]   book collection, you can often pull out, like, "Oh, I think these books were being read for
[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:43.840]   something he's working on."
[00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:44.840]   It'll be kind of one-off.
[00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:49.800]   You'll see a couple books on similar themes that I read, like, one after another.
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:54.440]   But when I'm researching a book or an article, oftentimes I'm not reading an entire book.
[00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:57.620]   I'm reading certain chapters of a book, or I'm skimming a book, or trying to get out
[00:29:57.620 --> 00:29:58.620]   of it what's important.
[00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:02.640]   And that's a lot of research, and those don't get counted.
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:06.600]   So yeah, I will count the book if I finish it, regardless of the cause.
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:11.200]   But when it comes to research, there's a lot less finishing a book than you might imagine.
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:14.640]   You get very good at, like, "This chapter's what's important of this book.
[00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:15.640]   Let me read these 10 articles.
[00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:19.860]   Oh, I remember reading this book 10 years ago, and this section is relevant to what
[00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:20.860]   I'm doing."
[00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:26.620]   I'll give you an example for the deep life book I'm working on now.
[00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:29.860]   The first part of the book, and especially the first chapter, the first part of the book,
[00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:32.040]   I'm drawing some from the history of monasticism.
[00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:35.180]   I'm actually sort of using the history of monasticism—we've talked about this on the
[00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:43.340]   show before—I'm using that as an analogy for understanding, preparing for the deep
[00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:44.340]   life.
[00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:48.180]   The idea being in the history of monasticism, just very, very briefly, you see very early
[00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:52.260]   on, Christian monasticism was kicked off.
[00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:57.380]   Its precursors were the so-called desert fathers, the hermits, essentially, that went out into
[00:30:57.380 --> 00:31:04.660]   the desert and led aesthetic lives, going to just be in a cave and eschew everything
[00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:07.680]   and have these religious experiences.
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:12.540]   What they discovered is, okay, this just, like, throw everything out and just go out
[00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:15.660]   there and be aesthetic and try not to die, and you'll eventually have a religious experience.
[00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:17.380]   It wasn't very replicatable.
[00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:21.680]   So the monastic system was built up, where they said, "Okay, we have to have structure.
[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:26.260]   We have to kind of help people prepare, the monks prepare to have these religious experiences
[00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:28.260]   with some structure.
[00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:30.740]   Here's how we run our days, and here's our rules.
[00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:36.380]   We have these short-term goals and structures to help get you ready for the big encounter
[00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:39.460]   with divinity, as opposed to just, like, let's just go for it."
[00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:42.940]   I have this whole analogy in the first part of the book, is this is the same when it comes
[00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:45.340]   to overhauling your life and overhauling a deep life.
[00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:47.620]   Don't just do the equivalent of going to the desert.
[00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:48.760]   Don't just make the big changes.
[00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:52.700]   You actually need short-term goals and structure that get you ready, that prepare you for making
[00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:53.700]   that big change.
[00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:56.980]   So the first part of the book is about, like, preparing yourself and practicing to get ready
[00:31:56.980 --> 00:31:58.380]   for big changes.
[00:31:58.380 --> 00:31:59.380]   Okay.
[00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:05.420]   I wanted to pull from Jamie Creener's book, The Distracted Mind, which is this, like,
[00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:06.420]   great book.
[00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:07.420]   She's a medievalist.
[00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:08.860]   I think she might be at Emory.
[00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:12.980]   I might have that wrong, but a medievalist that studies monks and wrote this good book.
[00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:14.060]   I think I blurbed it.
[00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:17.540]   So I had read it years ago, and I said, "This book is – she's a great medievalist.
[00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:21.180]   It's got a great sort of history about monks and how they think about distraction."
[00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:23.540]   But I didn't read that whole book.
[00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:27.560]   I read selected chapters that really had what I needed.
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:30.860]   It's like, that book didn't show up – I wrote this in July.
[00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:35.780]   That book did not show up on my July books I read, but I got really good information
[00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:36.780]   out of it.
[00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:39.300]   So a lot of research for books and articles is like that.
[00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:42.260]   You've heard of a book, you've read it a long time ago, and you're pulling out
[00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:44.100]   what you need.
[00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:50.220]   On the other hand, there are some books – I think, was it last month or the month before?
[00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:51.220]   Or is it this month?
[00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:52.780]   Let me see.
[00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:54.460]   What books are we reading this month?
[00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:55.460]   I don't know.
[00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:59.500]   I can't remember when I read what, but there's been a couple of these memoirs I've been
[00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:00.500]   reading recently.
[00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:07.700]   Like, Zena Hertz's – what was that book called?
[00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:11.540]   Not The Intellectual Life, that's Churchill and Jeans, but whatever – Lost in Thought,
[00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:13.100]   I think her book was called.
[00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:15.060]   And that was like a memoir of like an intellectual life.
[00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:19.620]   I reread Rich Roll's memoir recently, and that might be in the January books.
[00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:22.860]   I don't remember where these things are.
[00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:27.420]   I finished – you'll see there's like a bunch of memoirs that are coming up soon,
[00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:31.300]   and that's because I was preemptively like, I'm reading these various memoirs that have
[00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:34.460]   particular properties because I might want to pull something from them for my book.
[00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:40.460]   So what I'm trying to say, my peak inside the writing process here is a lot of times
[00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:44.260]   when researching stuff, you're not reading full books, and then sometimes you are, and
[00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:45.740]   I only report them when I do.
[00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:49.300]   And is that research done during deep work hours?
[00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:50.300]   Yeah.
[00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:56.740]   I mean, I worked on that – most of that monk writing was when we were up in the mountains
[00:33:56.740 --> 00:34:00.180]   and at the house that had the writing shed, that like really cool writing shed.
[00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:03.300]   Again, in the morning were my deep work hours, and I would go down to that writing shed with
[00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:05.180]   my coffee, and I was like reading that book.
[00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:09.220]   I have very strong connections with that book and that place, really.
[00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:12.140]   But that I was largely reading in deep work hours.
[00:34:12.140 --> 00:34:16.860]   I would be there with my laptop and I would read a chapter and underline it and then pull
[00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:18.500]   from it and write a little bit and read.
[00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:21.500]   It was really intertwined with the writing.
[00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:25.420]   Other books, if I'm lost in thought, that book, that was just reading during my normal
[00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:26.420]   reading hours.
[00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:27.420]   Yeah.
[00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:28.420]   Good question.
[00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:33.860]   I haven't really thought so systematically about how and when I read, so that's cool.
[00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:34.860]   All right.
[00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:36.260]   Who do we got next?
[00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:37.500]   Next question is from Heath.
[00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:43.980]   I'm a third year mechanical engineering student at Georgia Tech, and I've failed integral
[00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:44.980]   calculus twice.
[00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:48.500]   I spend over 30 hours in the library every week trying to study and never seem to get
[00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:50.980]   the results that one would expect from that effort.
[00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:56.300]   I bought How to Become a Straight A Student, but would appreciate an overview of the best
[00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:59.060]   strategies to learn high-level math.
[00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:00.900]   All right.
[00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:01.900]   Integral calculus.
[00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:05.260]   I was just reading about that in that math class book.
[00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:06.260]   Oh, yeah.
[00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:07.260]   Yeah.
[00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:11.180]   I'm going to go back to the remember multivariate integration.
[00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:12.500]   Okay.
[00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:19.260]   So Heath, when I see you say, "I spend over 30 hours in the library every week trying
[00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:23.700]   to study," that's meaningless to me.
[00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:27.300]   And I think the fact that that's meaningless is important because this really is one of
[00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:31.340]   the key messages I had for students in books like How to Become a Straight A Student.
[00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:32.740]   The term study is meaningless.
[00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:36.040]   It can mean all sorts of things, many things which aren't very useful at all when it comes
[00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:38.100]   to learning information.
[00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:42.580]   Studying is not a self-evident activity that you either do or don't do.
[00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:47.220]   A lot of students get into similar trouble like you get into by "studying for hour
[00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:51.100]   after hour," but what they're really doing is actually very ineffective when it comes
[00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:54.700]   to cementing in their mind understanding of knowledge.
[00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:59.260]   So a lot of people just have this mindset of like, "I spent a ton of time in the
[00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:04.060]   library the weekend before the exam," and that this is like penance.
[00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:08.700]   The pain of being in the library for 30 hours should transmute into a better grade.
[00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:13.500]   But your exam doesn't care like how painful your weekend was or how many hours you spent
[00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:14.500]   in the library.
[00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:16.180]   It cares how much you understand the material.
[00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:20.820]   And so all that really matters is activity that cements your understanding of the material.
[00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:25.100]   And as it turns out, the activities that best cement understanding of the material don't
[00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:27.160]   tend to be extremely time-consuming.
[00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:31.460]   The very best students don't tend to be the students who "study" the most, but they
[00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:34.680]   can be unpleasant because they're demanding.
[00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:39.360]   So for example, in your case, integral calculus, I write about this in the book How to Become
[00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:40.360]   a Straight A student.
[00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:44.640]   I also wrote a blog post you can find on my blog from way back when.
[00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:47.940]   It's titled something like "How I Got the Highest Grade in My Discrete Mathematics Course."
[00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:52.820]   I wrote this not long after I graduated from college, so I remembered getting the highest
[00:36:52.820 --> 00:36:56.620]   grade in my discrete math class, which was 50 or 60 students.
[00:36:56.620 --> 00:37:02.980]   My number one tool for studying in that class was a big stack of white printer paper.
[00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:06.400]   And what I would do, I had written down, and this method is in How to Become a Straight
[00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:11.660]   A Student, I had for every topic we covered sort of sample problems taken from lectures
[00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:13.860]   and/or problem sets.
[00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:19.460]   And I would copy one of the problems without the answer onto a sheet of white paper and
[00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:26.340]   then solve it on that paper while solving it, annotating it as if I was lecturing to
[00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:27.340]   a class.
[00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:28.340]   All right, so next we're going to do this.
[00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:32.860]   Well, hey, if we're doing this integration, what we're looking for here is the anti-derivative.
[00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:36.540]   And notice when doing the anti-derivative here that we can sort of ignore those terms
[00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:39.740]   because those would be constant, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:44.100]   If I could do that, I could get the answer right, show the proof, get to the right answer
[00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:47.620]   without looking at my notes, explaining my steps so I'm clearly indicating to myself
[00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:49.020]   I understand it.
[00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:50.020]   That topic's done.
[00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:51.020]   I don't come back to it.
[00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:55.260]   If I struggle, I go back and review it and try again later.
[00:37:55.260 --> 00:38:00.820]   Once I can actually teach from scratch sample problems from every topic I need to know,
[00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:02.340]   then I know it and I'm ready to take the class.
[00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:05.740]   And that got me the highest grade in my math class.
[00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:09.220]   Now the problem you might be having if you try this approach is that you might find that
[00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:11.660]   you're not able to answer many of the questions.
[00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:15.020]   Because what a lot of people do, and this is a huge problem I think with undergraduate
[00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:19.100]   education in general, a lot of people don't attend lectures or sort of tune out in lectures
[00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:23.580]   and then sort of implicitly hope that in the two days before the exam that they can not
[00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:28.740]   only study but teach themselves all the material from scratch.
[00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:32.260]   This is going to be the trap that I think really captures people.
[00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:36.260]   If I had to guess, the problem with your 30 hours is partially that what you're doing
[00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:37.260]   is ineffective.
[00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:40.460]   You're probably reading notes silently to yourself as opposed to trying to recreate
[00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:43.660]   problems from scratch, and partially you're spending most of that time trying to teach
[00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:44.660]   yourself the material.
[00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:46.180]   But the material's hard to teach.
[00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:48.460]   That's why they pay us professors the big bucks.
[00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:50.760]   It's not obvious how to teach yourself this stuff.
[00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:55.820]   So the other thing you have to do is the 48-hour rule, and again, this comes from how to become
[00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:56.820]   a straight-A student.
[00:38:56.820 --> 00:38:57.820]   But the idea is this.
[00:38:57.820 --> 00:38:59.620]   You go to lecture, you pay attention in lecture, you take notes.
[00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:03.460]   In a math class, you want to capture every sample problem, every step to the solution
[00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:06.340]   and annotate those steps to the best of your ability.
[00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:10.940]   When you don't understand something, this step in this integration problem, I don't
[00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:15.020]   understand how they did that, you put a question mark and you circle it.
[00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:16.740]   Now the clock is ticking.
[00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:21.600]   You got 48 hours to replace that question mark with understanding, not deferring it
[00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:22.600]   till the day before the exam.
[00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:28.120]   You got 48 hours to fill in that question mark right then, 40 hours from right then.
[00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:33.500]   Now you have various circles of time, sort of concentric circles of time to stretch out
[00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:35.600]   that you can work with here.
[00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:37.920]   So the very tightest circle is right away raise your hand.
[00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:39.820]   Hey, I don't understand what you just did.
[00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:42.520]   The next tightest circle is right after class.
[00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:43.520]   Go up to the professor.
[00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:45.240]   Hey, I don't understand what was happening here and here.
[00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:46.880]   Can you explain this to me?
[00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:50.020]   The next tightest circle would be office hours.
[00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:55.620]   Like when is the next time that there's office hours with either a TA or the professor?
[00:39:55.620 --> 00:39:58.840]   Also in between those circles is like talking to a friend or looking at the textbook to
[00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:00.220]   try to figure it out.
[00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:04.760]   So typically why we call it the 48 hours rules is that you're no more than 48 hours away
[00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:08.060]   from all of those circles being done, that you're no more than 48 hours away from probably
[00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:11.320]   the next office hours and all these other things can happen quicker.
[00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:14.720]   So by that point, you should have resolved those question marks.
[00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:20.920]   Now when you do this, when it comes time to "study for the exam," you already at some
[00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:23.080]   point understood all of the techniques.
[00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:26.840]   You actually went through the mental effort of grokking the technique already.
[00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:28.640]   There's nothing you're learning from scratch for the first time.
[00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:32.440]   You might have to review it, but there's a huge difference between remembering something
[00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:38.060]   you actually did the mental activity of learning than there is actually learning it from scratch.
[00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:42.120]   The effort to learn from scratch is intense, so you want to spread that out over the semester
[00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:44.400]   so you're not doing too much of it at once.
[00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:45.400]   And so "study," now you're reviewing.
[00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:48.760]   And then when you're reviewing, you want to use the white paper method of just, "I'm recreating
[00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:49.760]   things from scratch.
[00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:50.760]   If I can, I understand that.
[00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:51.760]   If I can't, I don't.
[00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:52.760]   Go back and review again."
[00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:55.680]   That's how you study for math class.
[00:40:55.680 --> 00:41:01.960]   It's all about distributing the understanding of the material as you learn it, and then
[00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:05.880]   you're reviewing being all what we call active recall, as that's the most effective way to
[00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:07.840]   actually cement knowledge.
[00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:13.720]   So if you can absolutely pass integral calculus, and integrals are not actually that complicated,
[00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:17.700]   but I think what's happening is you're probably trying to teach yourself this material from
[00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:19.800]   scratch a couple days before the exam.
[00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:20.800]   All right.
[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:24.040]   What do we got next?
[00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:25.040]   We have our corner.
[00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:27.540]   Hey, slow productivity corner question.
[00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:31.980]   We like to have one question every week that is related to my new book, "Slow Productivity,
[00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:33.640]   the Lost Art of Accomplishment Without Burnout."
[00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:39.520]   We mainly do this corner because we have theme music, which we're going to hear right now.
[00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:47.680]   All right, what's our slow productivity corner question of the week?
[00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:48.680]   It's from Dylan.
[00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:52.360]   In addition to your books, do you have any book recommendations for cultivating a deep
[00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:56.520]   life or to embrace slow productivity?
[00:41:56.520 --> 00:42:00.940]   What I often recommend, like if you're interested broadly in the deep life or more specifically
[00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:08.200]   in more of a slow productivity approach, find real stories that resonate.
[00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:10.640]   Usually this means memoir.
[00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:15.320]   Look for memoir that resonates because what happens is the written form, when you're reading
[00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:21.760]   a nonfiction book like a memoir, the written form can put you inside the head and experience
[00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:22.760]   of someone else.
[00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:26.460]   You get a sort of step into another life.
[00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:29.320]   When you're in that life, you've stepped into someone else's shoes.
[00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:34.360]   You really get a visceral sense of what resonates and what doesn't.
[00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:36.480]   It's really informative.
[00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:38.160]   There's a lot of self-discovery to be made.
[00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:41.240]   There's a lot of motivation or inspiration to be made about what's important to you,
[00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:44.000]   what's not important to you, what about this life is important to me, what's not.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:48.600]   I'm a big believer of finding memoirs where the life of the person being lived in the
[00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:51.240]   memoir speaks to you in some way.
[00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:55.000]   When I say memoir, I use that broadly.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:59.360]   It could be a book that is specifically a memoir, but sometimes it could be like a nonfiction
[00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:04.200]   book where it's a certain part of a person's life and they're doing some adventure or something
[00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:05.200]   like that.
[00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:08.600]   It could be anything that's actually about someone's life that resonates.
[00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:12.560]   I often think that's the right way to better understand yourself and what you're looking
[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:19.120]   for, what the possibilities are for pursuing it, as opposed to just straight-up advice.
[00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:22.280]   The obvious exception, of course, would be my books, which you need to buy many, many
[00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:23.280]   copies of.
[00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:24.280]   All right.
[00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:26.360]   Do we have a call this week?
[00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:27.360]   We do.
[00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:28.360]   Oh, wait.
[00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:29.360]   Should we hear the music one more time?
[00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:30.520]   Do we play ourselves out with the music?
[00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:32.200]   We do it half the time.
[00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:36.960]   I think in 2025, we should commit to playing ourselves out of the slow productivity corner
[00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:38.240]   by hearing the music one more time.
[00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:42.600]   Are we going to have a slow productivity for the whole year?
[00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:46.720]   That's a good question, at least for the next couple of months.
[00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:48.680]   I want to get to the one-year mark of the book.
[00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:49.680]   How about that?
[00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:50.680]   Oh, that's fair.
[00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:51.680]   That's only three months.
[00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:52.680]   The book came out in March?
[00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:53.680]   Yeah.
[00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:54.680]   Yeah.
[00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:55.680]   OK.
[00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:57.680]   So we're going to keep the corner alive until we get to the one-year anniversary of the
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:02.840]   book and in 2025, in the three months that are between now and that anniversary, we're
[00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:03.840]   going to play the music twice.
[00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:04.840]   So let's hear it one more time.
[00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:05.840]   All right.
[00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:14.360]   She said we have a call this week, Jesse.
[00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:15.360]   Yes, we do.
[00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:16.360]   All right.
[00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:17.360]   Let's hear it.
[00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:18.360]   OK.
[00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:19.360]   Hey, Cal.
[00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:20.360]   This is Trevor.
[00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:24.080]   I'm a digital product manager and earlier this year, I left my full-time position and
[00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:25.880]   started my own business.
[00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:32.040]   I'm offering consulting and fractional product management.
[00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:37.440]   Where I'm struggling is applying multi-scale planning to the growth of my own business.
[00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:45.080]   Previously, as an employee, I've gotten pretty good at applying the principles and prioritizing
[00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:48.640]   and time blocking toward our company goals.
[00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:54.480]   And even now, I feel like I'm doing a decent job applying that to my client work and helping
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:57.400]   them achieve theirs.
[00:44:57.400 --> 00:45:03.440]   Last week, I spent a day trying to work on multi-scale for my own business.
[00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:12.880]   And while I was able to develop the values, which I want to develop my lifestyle, career
[00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:21.000]   plan around, putting together that career strategic plan, I kept banging my head against
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:22.760]   the wall.
[00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:29.960]   So I'm curious if you could share more details in terms of what kinds of things are in your
[00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:42.960]   career strategic plan, because it's that middle piece between the values and principles into
[00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:49.240]   the weekly and daily planning that I'm struggling with in terms of growing my own business and
[00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:52.680]   career capital now as a solo printer.
[00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:53.680]   Thanks as always.
[00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:54.680]   All right.
[00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:58.440]   So in multi-scale planning, we have three levels.
[00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:02.840]   There's that strategic plan, which is maybe covering the next season.
[00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:06.880]   Then you have weekly planning, then you have daily planning.
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:11.040]   So the caller today is talking about that biggest scale, thinking through that more
[00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:16.560]   strategic plan that's maybe existing at the scope of something like a season.
[00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:20.240]   And it sounds like, if I'm understanding him properly, he's not sure what to put in there,
[00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:21.240]   right?
[00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:22.240]   Like, what is it?
[00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:24.200]   Like, what are my strategic goals?
[00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:29.320]   What am I working on, more specifically, you know, if you're writing this plan right now,
[00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:30.320]   for the winter and the spring?
[00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:32.600]   Like, what am I trying to get done by June?
[00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:34.440]   Where do I want to steer this ship?
[00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:39.120]   Well, I think there's two things that are relevant here that hopefully are helpful.
[00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:49.400]   One, it's OK for this to seem relatively underspecified if you're doing something new.
[00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:58.160]   In particular, it is sometimes not even clear what the potential opportunities to pursue
[00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:02.960]   are, what, like, you should put the pedal down on and what you should put the brake
[00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:04.360]   pedal down on.
[00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:08.180]   Sometimes this is not even clear yet when something is relatively new.
[00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:11.560]   You're still feeling out your client base and what's working and what the opportunities
[00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:12.560]   are.
[00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:14.240]   So it's completely fine if you're like, "I don't have this crystal clear.
[00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:15.240]   We need to try to...
[00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:19.780]   My goal for the next four months is to try to introduce this product or move this."
[00:47:19.780 --> 00:47:24.960]   You might actually be very sensically gathering data on this new setup and trying to just
[00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:27.080]   look for your moments, look for your spots.
[00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:31.480]   So that's completely fine to be underspecified, especially when something is new and you're
[00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:32.720]   still feeling yourself around.
[00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:37.040]   So your strategic plan, let's say, for this upcoming semester or season, for something
[00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:42.440]   new like you're talking about, might really seem very mundane.
[00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:50.820]   You know, it's continuing to polish your client management setup and to get your some sort
[00:47:50.820 --> 00:47:57.680]   of logistical pieces that you're using to bill or deliver assets, like, get those cleaned
[00:47:57.680 --> 00:47:58.960]   up and operating smoother.
[00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:00.320]   It might seem very mundane.
[00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:01.320]   And that's fine.
[00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:02.440]   That doesn't mean your ambitions are mundane.
[00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:08.400]   It means you're waiting to choose your spot to make a bigger move.
[00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:12.600]   The other thing I would say when it comes to these plans, the key is working backwards,
[00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:15.080]   especially when you're doing something like you're doing, which really is a lifestyle
[00:48:15.080 --> 00:48:16.080]   play.
[00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:19.880]   Fractional project management, for example, clearly you're looking for autonomy.
[00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:22.100]   You're looking for more flexibility.
[00:48:22.100 --> 00:48:27.640]   You really want to have this clarity about the properties of the ideal lifestyle that
[00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:29.520]   you're aiming towards.
[00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:37.600]   And you can keep coming back to that and asking the question, "What's going to move me closer
[00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:38.600]   towards those?
[00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:40.440]   What's going to move me farther away?"
[00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:44.280]   And this can lead you to some objectives that you might not otherwise come up with if you're
[00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:47.640]   just trying to say, like, "What's good for this business?" or "What's a big idea I can
[00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:48.640]   pursue?"
[00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:52.680]   So, like, one of the analyses you might be doing the new year, for example, is you have
[00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:55.680]   these properties identified that you're looking for in your ideal lifestyle and be saying,
[00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:58.000]   "Is there any big disconnects right now?
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:02.640]   Is there, like, one of these properties I'm really far away from or one that I seem to
[00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:04.280]   be moving farther away from?
[00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:09.700]   What changes could I imagine that could stop that erosion or move me closer to it?"
[00:49:09.700 --> 00:49:13.600]   So when you're specifically working backwards from properties of ideal lifestyle, specific
[00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:18.000]   changes can emerge that wouldn't normally show up if you were just taking an approach
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:21.120]   of, "Hey, what's something good to do with my business?" or "What's the natural next
[00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:22.120]   step to take with this?"
[00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:23.120]   Right?
[00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:24.120]   So those are my two answers.
[00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:27.120]   If you're doing something new, it's okay to—don't feel underspecified.
[00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:28.560]   That's okay.
[00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:32.440]   Sometimes you're just trying to, like, get the lights on and the invoice is sent out.
[00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:34.880]   And once you really get to know what you're doing, then the opportunities will become
[00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:37.120]   clear six months, a year down the line.
[00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:41.360]   And number two, work backwards from the properties of ideal lifestyle and just keep asking the
[00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:44.920]   question, "Am I on track towards getting closer to these?
[00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:49.560]   And in the places where I'm not, do I yet see a change I could make that would correct
[00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:50.560]   that?"
[00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:54.280]   And the answer might be, "Not yet, but at least I have it at the top of my mind."
[00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:55.600]   Or the answer might be, "You know what?
[00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:59.640]   I could do this completely unexpected thing that makes no sense financially, makes no
[00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:03.480]   sense strategically, but from the point of view of, like, it's really important to me
[00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:07.920]   that I can, you know, ski every day, makes a lot of sense.
[00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:11.280]   When I'm working backwards from my lifestyle image, this change I'm making makes a lot
[00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:12.280]   of sense."
[00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:13.840]   So those are the two things I would say keep in mind.
[00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:14.840]   All right.
[00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:16.960]   Well, we have a case study here.
[00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:20.520]   This is where people send in a description of how they've applied the type of advice
[00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:22.360]   we talked about on the show into their own life.
[00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:25.120]   So we can see the advice we discuss in action.
[00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:28.440]   If you have a case study, you can send it to jesse@calnewport.com.
[00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:29.440]   All right.
[00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:32.760]   The next case study comes from Holden.
[00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:36.000]   Holden says, "Long time listener, first time writer.
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:39.760]   I'm 28 years old and a gardener by trade.
[00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:42.600]   Out of high school, I fell for the follow your passion narrative.
[00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:46.880]   At the time, I was not ready to pursue a degree and elected to move across the country and
[00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:51.200]   pursue my dream of working in the mountain bike industry.
[00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:55.040]   I graduated from a certification program related to the mountain bike industry, got my foot
[00:50:55.040 --> 00:51:00.200]   in the door and accomplished what dreams I had for the industry by the time I was 22.
[00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:04.920]   I shortly became embittered by the industry and realized that regardless of one's passion,
[00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:07.060]   work eventually becomes just that.
[00:51:07.060 --> 00:51:10.840]   I left the bike industry at 23 and having established connections and friendships in
[00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:15.220]   a town that I love, I took the best job available to me at the time.
[00:51:15.220 --> 00:51:18.480]   This was a landscape gardening job where I could leverage the trail building and construction
[00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:22.000]   skills that I had gained over the preceding years.
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:25.400]   In the five years since leaving the mountain bike industry, I started my own landscaping
[00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:27.400]   company and enjoyed some success at that.
[00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:31.120]   For the last year and a half or so, I began to feel unfulfilled in my business venture
[00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:35.920]   and unhappy with the path I was on and had set for myself the past decade.
[00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:40.540]   This sense of unfulfillment as well as economic circumstances motivated me to begin to shutter
[00:51:40.540 --> 00:51:44.240]   my business and take a job with the local government as a gardener.
[00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:48.600]   I had fun in my early 20s, but I'm unfulfilled with where that has left me in my late 20s.
[00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:52.600]   I found that I enjoyed being a business owner/entrepreneur, but did not like my future in the particular
[00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:54.360]   industry I was in.
[00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:58.880]   I began doing lifestyle-centric career planning a few months ago.
[00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:02.860]   I have taken your advice and started a single-purpose notebook to jot down anything that resonates
[00:52:02.860 --> 00:52:05.960]   with me as it pertains to my ideal lifestyle.
[00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:09.000]   These things then inform my lifestyle-centric career plan.
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:12.360]   I have found the career path that I have been on since high school is not in alignment with
[00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:14.360]   where I want to be in life.
[00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:17.960]   I am called to more intellectual pursuits and work in which my mind as opposed to my
[00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:20.720]   body is the main tool I use to produce value.
[00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:25.720]   I am unsure how to make this transition or begin this transition towards a knowledge-based
[00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:26.720]   professional life.
[00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:30.640]   I do feel ready to pursue a degree now, but have trouble determining what I may study
[00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:32.760]   as I have an embarrassment of intellectual interest.
[00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:36.680]   I also cannot shake the small cow on my shoulder telling me that I am falling for the trap
[00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:41.240]   of grand goals, but I really enjoy studying for studying and knowledge's sake and do believe
[00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:45.880]   a degree would set me up better for a professional life where my mind is the main producer of
[00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:46.880]   value.
[00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:54.120]   All right, Holden, we see a pretty realistic case study here of lifestyle design in both
[00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:56.960]   its positives and negatives in action.
[00:52:56.960 --> 00:53:02.640]   I'm going to zoom in early on this story where he talked about my, quote, "dream of working
[00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:04.440]   in the mountain bike industry," end quote.
[00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:09.560]   That's like a classic passion trap type move, as Holden correctly identifies.
[00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:14.960]   The interest was in mountain biking, and our mind tricks us into thinking, well, if I had
[00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:20.560]   a job related to this thing I like, that must be my dream.
[00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:23.960]   And as Holden quickly learned, a job is a job.
[00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:28.720]   What matters for a job are the properties of the job, not the content, not the subject
[00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:29.720]   of that job.
[00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:33.000]   So the fact that your job is related to mountain biking probably doesn't matter so much as
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:39.120]   like what are the properties of that job—engagement, autonomy, connection, mastery, et cetera.
[00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:41.640]   So kind of a classic passion trap.
[00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:45.960]   All right, so he fell out of that, went into gardening where he could start his own business,
[00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:47.320]   use skills that he had built up.
[00:53:47.320 --> 00:53:48.720]   You have some rare and valuable skills.
[00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:52.640]   Now you have something you can put in the marketplace and you seem to do well with that.
[00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:59.120]   The government job doing gardening simplified probably his life, got rid of some autonomy,
[00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:00.240]   but simplified his life.
[00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:03.920]   Like I can just sort of do the work that I'm given.
[00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:06.880]   And now he's doing lifestyle-centric career planning and realizing there's parts of his
[00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:07.880]   life.
[00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:09.960]   Like if he really sits and says, well, what is it that I'm looking for in my life?
[00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:10.960]   He feels like there's a lack.
[00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:13.760]   All right, so now there's the complicated piece.
[00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:14.760]   Because yes, hold on.
[00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:18.800]   The small cow on your shoulder has a point.
[00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:23.280]   You want to be careful here of being like, OK, maybe what I'm missing is intellectual
[00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:24.280]   work.
[00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:27.720]   So let me just make a big swing and go get a degree and hope that this somehow leads
[00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:30.200]   to something that is better.
[00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:32.040]   I would be way more specific about this.
[00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:37.080]   I would really try to clarify what your ideal day looks like.
[00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:39.480]   Like is it sitting in an office?
[00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:44.320]   Is it writing poetry by the pond?
[00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:49.080]   Is it being outside but having a lot of flexibility with your hands?
[00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:54.860]   It could be that the government gardening job is this very stable base on top of which
[00:54:54.860 --> 00:54:58.960]   you are a writer, that you teach yourself to be a writer, which doesn't involve you
[00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:01.720]   like quitting everything and spending years going back for a degree.
[00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:05.160]   Or maybe really it's like you're tired of working with your hands and it's exhausting.
[00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:10.600]   And you say I would be very happy to have like a shed in my backyard that I convert
[00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:14.200]   into an office that I can go to and like work on a laptop and like five hours a day.
[00:55:14.200 --> 00:55:16.760]   And it's like kind of engaging that I could be done and go mountain biking.
[00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:17.760]   OK, great.
[00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:18.760]   That's a very specific other vision.
[00:55:18.760 --> 00:55:21.520]   You can start asking, what's the quickest way to get there?
[00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:26.000]   What are skills I can learn effectively and efficiently that allow me to try to find a
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:27.000]   job that can do that?
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:31.600]   So I would get very specific about what you want your day to be like and then figure out
[00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:33.560]   what are your opportunities and obstacles.
[00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:36.480]   You know, I'm concerned that you might just say I'll just go get a degree and then maybe
[00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:37.480]   this will all work out.
[00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:41.120]   You should be way ahead on your planning than that.
[00:55:41.120 --> 00:55:44.760]   I want to know how to do this because then I could do this type of work which allows
[00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:47.400]   my day to unfold in this type of way and that's what I'm really looking for.
[00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:51.760]   So you need to sort out like what is this like this appeal of the intellectual?
[00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:52.840]   What does this really mean?
[00:55:52.840 --> 00:55:56.440]   Is it really related to your actual day to day work?
[00:55:56.440 --> 00:55:59.160]   Is it related to what you do in your time outside of work?
[00:55:59.160 --> 00:56:03.240]   What are you actually looking for in work in terms of like how it feels and the autonomy
[00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:05.160]   or the financial remuneration?
[00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:08.000]   You need to keep thinking about your career capital.
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:11.520]   You're starting from scratch with career capital is very hard to compete in the marketplace
[00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:14.340]   with people that have more, etc.
[00:56:14.340 --> 00:56:21.760]   So this is a time not to get caught up in like a singular move because it can be seducing
[00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:24.600]   the move itself, right?
[00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:28.360]   You'll feel good if you do something big for a little while.
[00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:30.820]   Go back to school, you'll feel good because you made a big change.
[00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:31.820]   That's exciting.
[00:56:31.820 --> 00:56:32.820]   There's opportunity.
[00:56:32.820 --> 00:56:37.800]   That goodness wears off and you're still pursuing that change and it doesn't necessarily lead
[00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:39.400]   you to somewhere better.
[00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:44.560]   So this is the time to do careful lifestyle centric planning.
[00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:48.160]   Don't be seduced by any one particular change or move.
[00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:51.480]   That's a complicated case study there, Jesse.
[00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:56.000]   I love the reference of the little cow on the shoulder.
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:58.640]   That's what we're going to sell in our Shopify store.
[00:56:58.640 --> 00:57:03.180]   Little cows you place on your shoulder that basically just chastises you for looking at
[00:57:03.180 --> 00:57:06.860]   Instagram and says, "Don't get a master's degree."
[00:57:06.860 --> 00:57:07.860]   And don't make grand goals.
[00:57:07.860 --> 00:57:08.860]   Don't make grand goals.
[00:57:08.860 --> 00:57:09.860]   Stop looking at Instagram.
[00:57:09.860 --> 00:57:11.700]   Couldn't you be reading right now?
[00:57:11.700 --> 00:57:13.700]   That would sell well.
[00:57:13.700 --> 00:57:14.700]   That would sell well.
[00:57:14.700 --> 00:57:15.700]   All right.
[00:57:15.700 --> 00:57:20.500]   Well, speaking of books, we got a final segment coming up where I talk about the books I read
[00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:21.500]   in December.
[00:57:21.500 --> 00:57:25.260]   But first, another brief word from our sponsors.
[00:57:25.260 --> 00:57:31.420]   I want to talk about in particular our sponsor, Defender.
[00:57:31.420 --> 00:57:39.260]   We have the multiple Defenders, the 90, the Defender 110, the Defender 130, which can
[00:57:39.260 --> 00:57:41.920]   seat up to eight.
[00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:45.580]   These are very slick looking vehicles.
[00:57:45.580 --> 00:57:48.340]   They have that classic sort of durability.
[00:57:48.340 --> 00:57:53.340]   You can drive these things wherever, go seek out adventure with them.
[00:57:53.340 --> 00:57:54.340]   They're going to hold up.
[00:57:54.340 --> 00:57:55.340]   They're going to take you where you want to go.
[00:57:55.340 --> 00:57:56.340]   But they also look great.
[00:57:56.340 --> 00:58:00.340]   They have that timeless lines as well.
[00:58:00.340 --> 00:58:03.780]   Very nice looking brand of vehicle.
[00:58:03.780 --> 00:58:07.960]   What I want to briefly mention today is that like famous durability on the outside is now
[00:58:07.960 --> 00:58:16.500]   matched on the inside with the type of technology features that makes the modern driving comfortable.
[00:58:16.500 --> 00:58:20.740]   Talking about 3D surround cameras, including clear sight ground view, which lets you see
[00:58:20.740 --> 00:58:24.420]   underneath the vehicle and anticipate obstacles and rough terrain.
[00:58:24.420 --> 00:58:27.540]   It has the clear sight rear view mirror, got a bunch of stuff in the back of your car that's
[00:58:27.540 --> 00:58:29.420]   blocking your rear view mirror.
[00:58:29.420 --> 00:58:34.220]   You can still see in your mirror using a camera on the back of the car what is behind you.
[00:58:34.220 --> 00:58:39.500]   It has driver aid technologies to make driving and even parking much simpler.
[00:58:39.500 --> 00:58:42.620]   You got intuitive driver displays and the PIVI Pro infotainment system.
[00:58:42.620 --> 00:58:45.300]   That's a next generation system gets you to all that stuff.
[00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:51.020]   So it's just like kind of luxurious driving experience with a car that can take you wherever
[00:58:51.020 --> 00:58:52.020]   you need to go.
[00:58:52.020 --> 00:58:54.940]   So the Defender is a cool line of cars.
[00:58:54.940 --> 00:58:58.320]   Take you where you want to go and try to cultivate your deep life.
[00:58:58.320 --> 00:59:03.340]   You can visit LandRoverUSA.com to learn more about the Defender.
[00:59:03.340 --> 00:59:11.020]   I also want to talk about our friends at Roan and in particular their commuter collection.
[00:59:11.020 --> 00:59:15.220]   Look starchy stiff work wear is not optimal when you need to get through your busiest
[00:59:15.220 --> 00:59:17.520]   most important days.
[00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:23.180]   With Roan's commuter collection, your clothing looks professional, but performs like active
[00:59:23.180 --> 00:59:27.220]   wear and feels very comfortable.
[00:59:27.220 --> 00:59:30.920]   This is why I really like the commuter collections because you get that comfort and performance
[00:59:30.920 --> 00:59:34.980]   that breathability and flex and stretch of active wear, but it looks great.
[00:59:34.980 --> 00:59:39.780]   And you can wear it like right into that meeting or right to give that talk or my case to teach
[00:59:39.780 --> 00:59:41.460]   that class.
[00:59:41.460 --> 00:59:43.460]   Roan has premium pieces to elevate every occasion.
[00:59:43.460 --> 00:59:47.100]   We're talking about the world's most comfortable pants, dress shirts, quarter zips, polos,
[00:59:47.100 --> 00:59:49.020]   and blazers.
[00:59:49.020 --> 00:59:51.540]   All boosted with functional performance properties, right?
[00:59:51.540 --> 00:59:54.920]   So their signature technical fabrics stretch in every direction they breathe.
[00:59:54.920 --> 00:59:55.920]   This is important for me.
[00:59:55.920 --> 00:59:58.020]   I get hot when I'm like roaming the stage and giving talks.
[00:59:58.020 --> 01:00:00.960]   I need to look good, but I need to breathe.
[01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:02.780]   Roan commuter collection does this well.
[01:00:02.780 --> 01:00:03.780]   It fights odor.
[01:00:03.780 --> 01:00:07.960]   It allows you to effortlessly work everywhere so you can stay calm and collected even as
[01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:11.700]   your day gets demanding.
[01:00:11.700 --> 01:00:16.180]   It's time for unparalleled confidence without the hassle.
[01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:20.200]   Each piece in Roan's commuter collection is made to coordinate and layer for an instantly
[01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:21.200]   elevated look.
[01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:22.200]   She's buy a bunch of this stuff.
[01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:23.200]   It's all gonna look good together.
[01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:27.220]   A little colder, put on the quarter zip, you know, put on the blazer, put over the quarter
[01:00:27.220 --> 01:00:28.220]   zip.
[01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:29.220]   It all looks good together.
[01:00:29.220 --> 01:00:31.220]   You don't have to waste time thinking about that.
[01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:34.340]   Probably the part I like the most is the wrinkle release technology.
[01:00:34.340 --> 01:00:36.220]   So this is machine watchable clothes.
[01:00:36.220 --> 01:00:37.220]   Don't worry about dry cleaners.
[01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:41.660]   Hang it up, wrinkles, release, no ironing, travel with it, hang it up when you get to
[01:00:41.660 --> 01:00:42.660]   hotel.
[01:00:42.660 --> 01:00:44.500]   Don't have to worry about the wrinkles.
[01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:47.820]   It has made my life for sure simpler.
[01:00:47.820 --> 01:00:50.260]   It's a great collection of clothes.
[01:00:50.260 --> 01:00:54.480]   The commuter collection can get you through any day and straight into whatever comes next.

[01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:13.620]   All right, let's get on to our final segment.
[01:01:13.620 --> 01:01:14.860]   All right.
[01:01:14.860 --> 01:01:19.180]   So I like to report in the first episode of each month, the books I read in the preceding
[01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:21.540]   month as longtime listeners.
[01:01:21.540 --> 01:01:24.500]   No, I read, I try to read five books a month.
[01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:25.500]   Okay.
[01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:30.460]   So it's January 2nd when we're recording this, so we're gonna be talking about the books
[01:01:30.460 --> 01:01:34.460]   from December 2024.
[01:01:34.460 --> 01:01:38.020]   There's no, I like in December because of the holidays as a way to kind of unwind from
[01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:39.380]   the fall to be thrillers.
[01:01:39.380 --> 01:01:41.500]   I love thrillers in particular, techno thrillers.
[01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:45.860]   So I call December thriller December.
[01:01:45.860 --> 01:01:49.580]   And this December did not disappoint, especially because I was dealing with these medical,
[01:01:49.580 --> 01:01:50.980]   this injury I've been recovering from.
[01:01:50.980 --> 01:01:54.180]   I was like, the thrillers were like, I went two ways with this.
[01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:56.260]   I read a bunch of thrillers early on.
[01:01:56.260 --> 01:02:02.380]   And then, and these books are all gonna show up in the January list because I was just
[01:02:02.380 --> 01:02:03.380]   finishing them now.
[01:02:03.380 --> 01:02:06.860]   So I turned to books that were like hardcore intellectual because I couldn't exercise.
[01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:09.340]   So I was like, well, what can I do still?
[01:02:09.340 --> 01:02:10.380]   I can still think.
[01:02:10.380 --> 01:02:13.300]   So like I read a bunch of math stuff, which we'll get into at the next book.
[01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:15.260]   But I started December with a bunch of thrillers.
[01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:21.900]   All right, here's the first thriller I read was Brad Meltzer's book, Midnight Ride.
[01:02:21.900 --> 01:02:25.780]   So Brad is known, he's a Boston based writer that's known for writing these sort of narrative
[01:02:25.780 --> 01:02:27.800]   nonfiction books.
[01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:32.020]   He got famous with Bringing Down the House, which was about the MIT Blackjack Club that
[01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:34.060]   got made into the movie 21.
[01:02:34.060 --> 01:02:40.260]   But he also wrote the book The Social, no, The Accidental Billionaires about Mark Zuckerberg,
[01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:45.860]   which was the book on which the movie The Social Network was based.
[01:02:45.860 --> 01:02:50.460]   So this was his style was he wrote these nonfiction books, but he would write the nonfiction books
[01:02:50.460 --> 01:02:53.140]   in a novelistic style, like with dialogue and interior thoughts.
[01:02:53.140 --> 01:02:55.340]   So he was like, he kind of just like guesses.
[01:02:55.340 --> 01:02:58.220]   So it's like this mix of like fiction and nonfiction.
[01:02:58.220 --> 01:03:07.740]   But during the pandemic, he serialized in a Boston newspaper, a thriller like each week,
[01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:08.740]   like another chapter.
[01:03:08.740 --> 01:03:10.640]   It's kind of cool, like Dickens used to do.
[01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:12.900]   And then he collected into this book, The Midnight Ride.
[01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:16.340]   So this is like a National Treasure style plot line.
[01:03:16.340 --> 01:03:18.360]   It takes place in Boston.
[01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:21.060]   It's a Harvard professor and a Tufts professor.
[01:03:21.060 --> 01:03:23.780]   It has to do with the colonial periods.
[01:03:23.780 --> 01:03:27.940]   They're going to all these different historical sites in Boston to try to collect clues that
[01:03:27.940 --> 01:03:29.140]   are hidden in them.
[01:03:29.140 --> 01:03:30.780]   One of those type of one of those types of books.
[01:03:30.780 --> 01:03:32.660]   And it was a lot of fun.
[01:03:32.660 --> 01:03:36.620]   It doesn't end at the end of this book as part of a longer series, so you're going to
[01:03:36.620 --> 01:03:37.620]   have to keep going.
[01:03:37.620 --> 01:03:39.380]   And, you know, I thought it was well done.
[01:03:39.380 --> 01:03:41.540]   I mean, it's the style he was writing his nonfiction books in.
[01:03:41.540 --> 01:03:48.060]   So when it's purely fiction, he can just let it unfold in any crazy way he wants.
[01:03:48.060 --> 01:03:50.940]   And so there's some cool Boston history in there, some good villains.
[01:03:50.940 --> 01:03:51.940]   I don't know.
[01:03:51.940 --> 01:03:52.940]   I think it was well done.
[01:03:52.940 --> 01:03:53.940]   Midnight Ride.
[01:03:53.940 --> 01:04:00.780]   Then I went and read one of the few Michael Crichton books that I haven't yet read.
[01:04:00.780 --> 01:04:03.540]   Was Eaters of the Dead.
[01:04:03.540 --> 01:04:04.540]   Have you heard of this one?
[01:04:04.540 --> 01:04:05.540]   No.
[01:04:05.540 --> 01:04:10.300]   So, I mean, this was written in this period post Andromeda Strain, but really before Crichton
[01:04:10.300 --> 01:04:12.180]   was like a huge writer.
[01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:14.380]   Andromeda Strain was a big deal.
[01:04:14.380 --> 01:04:16.660]   But he wasn't a huge writer right away after that.
[01:04:16.660 --> 01:04:19.900]   He was he was much more eclectic in his writing style.
[01:04:19.900 --> 01:04:25.500]   He was still doing some kind of cheaper thrillers under nom-de-guerres, like under fake names
[01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:26.500]   at this period.
[01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:30.620]   And he was also going all around stylistically.
[01:04:30.620 --> 01:04:32.500]   This is when he wrote like The Great Train Robbery.
[01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:35.220]   He was doing nonfiction.
[01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:38.660]   He wrote a book about like a memoir of his travelings.
[01:04:38.660 --> 01:04:40.980]   He wrote a biography of Jasper Johns.
[01:04:40.980 --> 01:04:45.340]   And in that period, that early experimental period, he wrote The Eaters of the Dead, which
[01:04:45.340 --> 01:04:47.620]   is it's a book about Vikings.
[01:04:47.620 --> 01:04:50.820]   It's told, it's written like you've discovered a historical document.
[01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:58.700]   The whole conceit is like this is a document, written by someone who is part of this trip
[01:04:58.700 --> 01:04:59.700]   with these Vikings.
[01:04:59.700 --> 01:05:02.020]   And this is like in the year 600 or something.
[01:05:02.020 --> 01:05:04.700]   And we've translated this from the Arabic.
[01:05:04.700 --> 01:05:06.540]   And you're reading a historical document, right?
[01:05:06.540 --> 01:05:08.100]   Like that's the conceit.
[01:05:08.100 --> 01:05:13.740]   He actually built it off of a real document that talked about the travel of someone from
[01:05:13.740 --> 01:05:18.780]   like, I don't know, some court in the Middle East all the way towards Scandinavia.
[01:05:18.780 --> 01:05:23.260]   And then once they actually get to Scandinavia, it's basically Beowulf.
[01:05:23.260 --> 01:05:25.340]   So there's like grindles in there.
[01:05:25.340 --> 01:05:27.260]   So then it becomes full out fantastical.
[01:05:27.260 --> 01:05:32.440]   So he kind of is in the style of like a real historical account that existed of traveling
[01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:36.780]   with Vikings back then that turns into Beowulf and they're fighting monsters or whatever.
[01:05:36.780 --> 01:05:39.260]   And it's, you know, it's interesting.
[01:05:39.260 --> 01:05:45.760]   It's weird because it's like in the style of a translated 7th century travelogue.
[01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:48.100]   He wrote weird stuff back then.
[01:05:48.100 --> 01:05:49.100]   So it's okay.
[01:05:49.100 --> 01:05:50.460]   It's okay.
[01:05:50.460 --> 01:05:55.580]   Then following this theme, the third thriller I wrote was The Andromeda Evolution, a follow
[01:05:55.580 --> 01:05:59.620]   up to Michael Crichton's breakout book, The Andromeda Strain, written after Michael Crichton
[01:05:59.620 --> 01:06:02.660]   died by Daniel Wilson.
[01:06:02.660 --> 01:06:05.260]   That's a pretty good thriller.
[01:06:05.260 --> 01:06:06.540]   Pretty good straight up thriller.
[01:06:06.540 --> 01:06:13.620]   Man, it gets a little crazy, you know, it makes me respect early Crichton more.
[01:06:13.620 --> 01:06:20.380]   The Andromeda Strain had some like big, big high concept ideas in it, but it still felt
[01:06:20.380 --> 01:06:21.620]   very grounded.
[01:06:21.620 --> 01:06:23.920]   Like you're reading like a cool New Yorker piece.
[01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:25.580]   This thing, it gets pretty crazy.
[01:06:25.580 --> 01:06:26.580]   It's an outer space.
[01:06:26.580 --> 01:06:27.900]   Like it gets pretty crazy.
[01:06:27.900 --> 01:06:30.420]   Like it's pretty high octane.
[01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:35.580]   The biggest issue I had with it is not everything is well motivated.
[01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:41.060]   There's this like mission to go investigate this thing and it's unclear like why these
[01:06:41.060 --> 01:06:44.420]   people have to do it and why they have to like go through the woods to do it and why
[01:06:44.420 --> 01:06:45.420]   they can't just drop them off.
[01:06:45.420 --> 01:06:50.320]   Like there's, there's some, we just need these people to be in the woods and so action can
[01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:53.180]   take place and it doesn't really, there's some lack of motivation that Crichton was
[01:06:53.180 --> 01:06:54.180]   fantastic at.
[01:06:54.180 --> 01:06:56.140]   Like everything is always motivated in a Crichton book.
[01:06:56.140 --> 01:06:59.660]   You completely believe why someone is doing what they're doing.
[01:06:59.660 --> 01:07:03.380]   They play a little fast and loose with this here, but it gets wild and it was fun.
[01:07:03.380 --> 01:07:04.380]   It was good.
[01:07:04.380 --> 01:07:05.380]   It was pretty good.
[01:07:05.380 --> 01:07:06.380]   So evolution.
[01:07:06.380 --> 01:07:07.380]   All right.
[01:07:07.380 --> 01:07:12.260]   Then I read, leaving the thriller theme, I read Open.
[01:07:12.260 --> 01:07:13.860]   That's Andre Agassi's memoir.
[01:07:13.860 --> 01:07:18.580]   Man, tough to be a professional athlete.
[01:07:18.580 --> 01:07:22.380]   He grew up in a situation where his dad was like, I'm going to make you into a tennis
[01:07:22.380 --> 01:07:23.820]   player.
[01:07:23.820 --> 01:07:26.740]   And it wasn't necessarily like the best childhood.
[01:07:26.740 --> 01:07:33.620]   And then he builds these entourages where it's like very needy and I don't think, I
[01:07:33.620 --> 01:07:37.380]   don't think Agassi even realizes this where he'll, he'll just glom on to these people
[01:07:37.380 --> 01:07:40.580]   and then give them these big speeches of like, you have to be in my life and my life means
[01:07:40.580 --> 01:07:41.580]   nothing without you.
[01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:44.940]   And he creates these like entourages of big trainers and stuff that just like follow him
[01:07:44.940 --> 01:07:45.940]   around.
[01:07:45.940 --> 01:07:46.940]   And it was interesting.
[01:07:46.940 --> 01:07:53.340]   The main issue is I'm dealing with some pain from my injury I'm recovering from and like
[01:07:53.340 --> 01:07:56.580]   Agassi's whole life becomes pain after a while, you know, a professional athlete who plays
[01:07:56.580 --> 01:07:57.580]   well into their thirties.
[01:07:57.580 --> 01:07:59.060]   So I was like, that's a little close to home.
[01:07:59.060 --> 01:08:01.820]   And it was, what's his face?
[01:08:01.820 --> 01:08:02.820]   He wrote the book, right?
[01:08:02.820 --> 01:08:03.820]   Yeah.
[01:08:03.820 --> 01:08:04.820]   He wrote it with the ghostwriter.
[01:08:04.820 --> 01:08:05.820]   Yeah.
[01:08:05.820 --> 01:08:06.820]   Yeah.
[01:08:06.820 --> 01:08:08.820]   It was the guy who wrote, well, Henry Barr.
[01:08:08.820 --> 01:08:09.820]   Yeah.
[01:08:09.820 --> 01:08:10.820]   And Prince Harry's.
[01:08:10.820 --> 01:08:11.820]   Yeah.
[01:08:11.820 --> 01:08:12.820]   Yeah.
[01:08:12.820 --> 01:08:13.820]   Prince Harry's.
[01:08:13.820 --> 01:08:14.820]   Yeah.
[01:08:14.820 --> 01:08:15.820]   So it's a great, good ghostwriter.
[01:08:15.820 --> 01:08:16.820]   He kind of takes on his voice.
[01:08:16.820 --> 01:08:18.700]   It was a good story though.
[01:08:18.700 --> 01:08:20.420]   You really learn about the world of professional tennis.
[01:08:20.420 --> 01:08:24.580]   I mean, it's a problem with all these sports memoirs is they sometimes have a hard time
[01:08:24.580 --> 01:08:31.060]   really capturing at that level what makes you so good.
[01:08:31.060 --> 01:08:36.980]   And, you know, this book had the issue of there was a lot of like, just, I was feeling
[01:08:36.980 --> 01:08:39.020]   it today.
[01:08:39.020 --> 01:08:40.020]   And so I beat Pete Sampras.
[01:08:40.020 --> 01:08:43.700]   And then other days, like, I just wasn't feeling it that day.
[01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:47.380]   They often make it seem like in these books that winning at this level is like a matter
[01:08:47.380 --> 01:08:50.700]   of just, you really extra commit.
[01:08:50.700 --> 01:08:54.420]   And then, you know, you turn it on and like some sort of abstract sense.
[01:08:54.420 --> 01:08:57.540]   And I'm much more interested, like they give hints that like, no, no, no.
[01:08:57.540 --> 01:09:03.980]   It's like, I guess he had like the serve return that his dad had forced into him that like
[01:09:03.980 --> 01:09:08.300]   this was his advantage or his quickness or it's like, you know, I really love when a
[01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:10.500]   book gets to that.
[01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:11.700]   What makes a great athlete great?
[01:09:11.700 --> 01:09:17.580]   So if you look at levels of the game, by contrast, John McPhee's book about tennis, the US Open,
[01:09:17.580 --> 01:09:24.300]   that's much better at capturing like what made the tennis player good, like what they
[01:09:24.300 --> 01:09:27.940]   did, what the other player did, what that cat and mouse game was like, how this all
[01:09:27.940 --> 01:09:28.940]   works.
[01:09:28.940 --> 01:09:32.060]   Like that was a much better book at capturing like what, what makes you good at the sport.
[01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:33.780]   A lot of times you support memoirs don't get there.
[01:09:33.780 --> 01:09:37.180]   Well, you still have to be on the, in that level, right?
[01:09:37.180 --> 01:09:38.180]   Yeah.
[01:09:38.180 --> 01:09:40.500]   And then it's amongst the level where it gets distinguished.
[01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:41.500]   Yeah.
[01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:43.540]   So like at that level, like why, yeah.
[01:09:43.540 --> 01:09:47.140]   What did he have that even when he's like a little bit older and achy that like he could
[01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:48.940]   turn it on and beat so many of these other people?
[01:09:48.940 --> 01:09:49.940]   I just looked it up.
[01:09:49.940 --> 01:09:50.940]   He had eight majors.
[01:09:50.940 --> 01:09:51.940]   I didn't realize he had so many.
[01:09:51.940 --> 01:09:52.940]   Yeah.
[01:09:52.940 --> 01:09:53.940]   Yeah.
[01:09:53.940 --> 01:09:54.940]   Yeah.
[01:09:54.940 --> 01:09:55.940]   Yeah.
[01:09:55.940 --> 01:09:56.940]   He was good.
[01:09:56.940 --> 01:09:57.940]   He was good.
[01:09:57.940 --> 01:09:58.940]   I mean, the other problem about the book, it's not a problem, the book, but just about
[01:09:58.940 --> 01:10:01.560]   tennis, like most of the time he's losing because most of the time you lose, you know,
[01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:04.420]   so there's like these whole long sweatshirt and you just lose, lose, lose, lose because
[01:10:04.420 --> 01:10:09.500]   it's so minor that a little edge you're required to win that you can just lose for a year.
[01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:10.500]   Yeah.
[01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:12.940]   I guess in individual sports is you lose a lot like golf, you lose a lot.
[01:10:12.940 --> 01:10:13.940]   You just lose a lot.
[01:10:13.940 --> 01:10:14.940]   Yeah.
[01:10:14.940 --> 01:10:15.940]   Yeah.
[01:10:15.940 --> 01:10:18.940]   Like if you read a memoir of golf, like you lose most of the matches or tournaments, whatever
[01:10:18.940 --> 01:10:19.940]   they're called.
[01:10:19.940 --> 01:10:20.940]   Yeah.
[01:10:20.940 --> 01:10:21.940]   So he was, he was good.
[01:10:21.940 --> 01:10:23.380]   But yeah, he won a bunch of, he won a bunch of majors.
[01:10:23.380 --> 01:10:24.420]   He was very good.
[01:10:24.420 --> 01:10:33.180]   He was not, the sense I got is like the, he's a great, but like the super greats were more,
[01:10:33.180 --> 01:10:36.580]   not organized, but like their life was much more structured around.
[01:10:36.580 --> 01:10:38.420]   He was more fast and loose, right?
[01:10:38.420 --> 01:10:42.060]   It's like Pete Sampras was more just regimented.
[01:10:42.060 --> 01:10:46.860]   Like his life was much more carefully built around what you need to do to do well at tennis.
[01:10:46.860 --> 01:10:51.020]   What do you need to do with like your body and your recovery and the, and it was very
[01:10:51.020 --> 01:10:54.100]   like locked in and Augusty was sort of all over the place.
[01:10:54.100 --> 01:10:57.580]   There's a part of this book where he's, he's taking meth.
[01:10:57.580 --> 01:11:00.020]   Did he talk about his hair?
[01:11:00.020 --> 01:11:01.020]   Yeah.
[01:11:01.020 --> 01:11:02.020]   Yeah.
[01:11:02.020 --> 01:11:03.780]   His hair fell out early and then he would wear, he was wearing wigs and stuff like that.
[01:11:03.780 --> 01:11:04.780]   Yeah.
[01:11:04.780 --> 01:11:05.780]   Yeah.
[01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:06.780]   It's interesting.
[01:11:06.780 --> 01:11:11.260]   The final book I read in December is called The Future Was Now by Chris Nashawati.
[01:11:11.260 --> 01:11:16.460]   This is from this genre of book that I like that there's a lot of similarity to it, right?
[01:11:16.460 --> 01:11:20.520]   It's a movie book where it'll be about a movie or a group of movies and it's kind of basically
[01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:21.620]   oral histories, right?
[01:11:21.620 --> 01:11:26.180]   Like we're just going to like tell you a lot about, like it's not, I discovered there's
[01:11:26.180 --> 01:11:30.340]   a whole genre of these I've been reading where we're going to talk about this movie year
[01:11:30.340 --> 01:11:32.700]   or this particular movie and it's just like an oral history.
[01:11:32.700 --> 01:11:34.180]   Like here's what happened.
[01:11:34.180 --> 01:11:38.120]   Here's, they collect quotes from like a lot of other sources and pull it together.
[01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:39.580]   But I find them comforting.
[01:11:39.580 --> 01:11:44.220]   The Future Was Now is about the sci-fi movies from 1989.
[01:11:44.220 --> 01:11:47.660]   So there's like all of these like big sci-fi movies came out in the same year.
[01:11:47.660 --> 01:11:52.820]   This is like ET, this is the year that Blade Runner came out, it's the year that Conan
[01:11:52.820 --> 01:12:01.140]   the Barbarian came out and Tron came out and so there's all of these, these big sci-fi,
[01:12:01.140 --> 01:12:04.900]   like the idea of the big sci-fi movie became a thing in this one year.
[01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:08.260]   And so he kind of tells the stories of all these movies and how they came about or whatever.
[01:12:08.260 --> 01:12:09.700]   So it's interesting.
[01:12:09.700 --> 01:12:12.620]   You learn, you hear about the directors and what was happening and this was sort of the
[01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:13.620]   year that changed movies.
[01:12:13.620 --> 01:12:17.200]   It was like, oh, we could, these like big sci-fi movies can be like huge box office
[01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:20.180]   and that it kind of helped kicked off that idea.
[01:12:20.180 --> 01:12:21.180]   So it was great.
[01:12:21.180 --> 01:12:25.380]   If you like movies and like these sort of oral history style movie books, this one was
[01:12:25.380 --> 01:12:26.380]   good.
[01:12:26.380 --> 01:12:28.780]   I listened to this one instead of read it and finished it.
[01:12:28.780 --> 01:12:29.780]   So it's good.
[01:12:29.780 --> 01:12:30.780]   All right.
[01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:32.540]   That's what I got.
[01:12:32.540 --> 01:12:38.740]   Those are my books from December and at the end of January, I'll report what I read in
[01:12:38.740 --> 01:12:39.740]   January.
[01:12:39.740 --> 01:12:43.820]   As I mentioned, it's a lot more mathy because I was sort of punishing myself, I don't know,
[01:12:43.820 --> 01:12:48.200]   trying to compensate for lack of physical activity with more intellectual activity.
[01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:56.060]   So more on that, but let's just say I can tell you now about how support vector machines
[01:12:56.060 --> 01:13:02.160]   and machine learning are really using kernels to help do multidimensional dot products to
[01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:06.400]   help figure out optimal margin algorithms in multidimensions without the computational
[01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:07.400]   power.
[01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:11.040]   I can talk to you about infinite dimension calculus and why you want to use this on vector
[01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:15.840]   representations of functions as a dual way of thinking about function calculus, etc.
[01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:19.720]   All stuff I learned after Thriller December to try to compensate for my body not doing
[01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:20.720]   what I wanted to do.
[01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:24.000]   You'll learn all about that in a few weeks, but we'll be back next week with just a normal
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.000]   episode.
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:28.800]   And until then, as always, stay deep.
[01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:33.760]   If you like today's episode, and in particular, the part where I talked about weekly templates,
[01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:38.200]   you might want to check out episode 316, where I give a much more detailed discussion of
[01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:40.480]   that particular productivity technique.
[01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:41.480]   Check it out.
[01:13:41.480 --> 01:13:43.160]   I think you'll like it.
[01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:45.160]   So what is this tool we're going to talk about?
[01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:47.320]   I call it the weekly template.
