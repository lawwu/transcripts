[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.560]   Welcome back to the podcast.
[00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.880]   Last Wednesday, we looked at the fact
[00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.040]   that God makes much of us, his children.
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.000]   He really does make much of us.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.520]   Why does he make so much of us?
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.960]   He makes so much of us because he is glorifying himself
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.080]   by redeeming us.
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.040]   In ABJ 1772, we looked at that point in detail.
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.200]   But in that same sermon, we get another point added.
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.920]   It's a follow-up, and one essential
[00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.000]   to the overall argument Pastor John is making.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.880]   And it's worth reflecting on here in the podcast
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.680]   because Pastor John knows that for many people,
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.080]   to hear that they were saved
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.760]   so that God would glorify himself in us
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.540]   seems to take away some of the luster of that love.
[00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.400]   Pastor John will directly push back against that point
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.240]   a little bit later.
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.640]   He'll answer that question and that concern
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.160]   and show clearly why it's not less loving
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.260]   for God to love us for himself.
[00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.520]   But before we get there, and we'll get there soon,
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.520]   Pastor John wants to simply dwell
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.660]   on this previously stated fact.
[00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.120]   If you are God's blood-bought child,
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.680]   God makes much of you.
[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.040]   He does, he really does.
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.300]   In fact, he makes more of you and more of me
[00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.820]   than we could ever dare imagine.
[00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.740]   Here's the biblical proof he was eager to share
[00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.840]   with his church, and this is what he told them.
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.540]   So that's what I meant when I said,
[00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.140]   why does the Bible relentlessly reveal
[00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.000]   the love of God for us in a way
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.460]   that constantly calls attention to the fact
[00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.140]   that it is done for his glory?
[00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.580]   Because so many people, when they hear that,
[00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.160]   feel it as not loving.
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:50.100]   The point of those texts throughout the Bible
[00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.100]   where God performs his love for us for his glory
[00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.160]   is to show that he loves us in the greatest possible way.
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.920]   Why?
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.760]   How does that show that it's a greater love?
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.000]   How is it a greater love when he loves me for his glory
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.080]   than if he just loved me and it all terminated on me?
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.920]   Well, before I answer that question,
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.960]   I will answer it.
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.580]   Before I answer it, let me dwell with you
[00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.580]   on the truth that evidently some have assumed,
[00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:34.320]   I denied, in asking, do you feel more loved by God
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.820]   when he makes much of you?
[00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.360]   Or do you feel more loved by God when he frees you
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.400]   at the cost of his son to enjoy making much of him forever?
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.500]   It's been assumed by some, oh, you don't think
[00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.800]   he makes much of us.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.200]   Well, that's a non sequitur.
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.300]   It doesn't follow from what I said, but okay,
[00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.820]   I don't want to defend myself.
[00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.960]   Some have gotten that idea and I would like to now fix it
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.760]   and keep fixing it.
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.920]   If I get things imbalanced, I'd like to get them
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.000]   back into balance, okay?
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   So here we are, trying to help those who heard it that way.
[00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.900]   The answer is yes, God makes more of you
[00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.080]   than you could ever imagine.
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.100]   And I will blow you away for the next five minutes, okay?
[00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:30.840]   Put your seatbelt on if you have trouble
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.080]   with being made much of by God
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.260]   because you might leave otherwise.
[00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.760]   Number one, I think I have seven of these
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.360]   and they'll go back quickly.
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.360]   Number one, God makes much of us by being pleased with us
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.760]   and commending our lives.
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.100]   Alan Jacobs wrote a great biography of C.S. Lewis
[00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.600]   and he says in C.S. Lewis's biography
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.420]   that the greatest sermon that C.S. Lewis ever preached
[00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.020]   was called the weight of glory.
[00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:08.500]   That is, believers will one day have a weight of glory
[00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.680]   that will be so heavy they will imagine,
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.400]   I don't know if I can bear this, it's so good.
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.220]   What do you think the weight of glory was in that sermon?
[00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:25.860]   It was the words, well done, good and faithful servant.
[00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.440]   And here's what Lewis said.
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:36.160]   To please God, to be a real ingredient
[00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.500]   in the divine happiness, to be loved by God
[00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.600]   not merely pitied but delighted in,
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:51.620]   as an artist delights in his work or a father in his son,
[00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.460]   it seems impossible.
[00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.420]   A weight or a burden of glory
[00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:04.420]   which our thoughts can hardly sustain, but so it is.
[00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.100]   But so it is and he's right.
[00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.980]   That's number one.
[00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:17.860]   God makes much of us by being pleased with us,
[00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.860]   making us an ingredient, ingredient in the divine happiness.
[00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:29.140]   Like a artist with something he painted
[00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:32.100]   or like a father, a son.
[00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.880]   Number two, God makes much of us
[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.880]   by making us fellow heirs with his son who owns everything.
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:48.780]   Blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the what?
[00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.220]   I wonder if you believe that.
[00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:56.580]   I do, mine.
[00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.780]   I don't need it now therefore, right?
[00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:02.860]   I don't need it now, I don't need to scrounge
[00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.780]   to get a piece of earth for about 50 years
[00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:09.460]   and then maybe lose everything.
[00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.260]   I am very happy to belong to King Jesus,
[00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.220]   be a fellow heir of Jesus Christ who owns the universe
[00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:20.220]   and get my globe at death or maybe at the resurrection.
[00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:24.700]   And I won't mind sharing it with you.
[00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:28.020]   And if that's a problem, he'll make another globe.
[00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:29.860]   In fact, he won't have to make another globe,
[00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:30.900]   they're out there.
[00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:36.820]   You get quasar 10, which is probably greener.
[00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:42.540]   The promise to Abraham, I'm reading another text
[00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:45.700]   on this point, the promise to Abraham and his offspring
[00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:49.860]   is that he would be heir of the world.
[00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:51.100]   Are you an heir of Abraham?
[00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:52.420]   You indeed are an heir.
[00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:55.380]   In Christ, we are Abraham's offspring
[00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:58.660]   and Abraham was promised the world, Romans 4, 13.
[00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.580]   One more, 1 Corinthians 3, 21.
[00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:01.620]   Is this the best of all?
[00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:03.100]   Probably.
[00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:04.900]   Let no one boast of men.
[00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:10.660]   He's trying to help Bethlehem not boast.
[00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:13.180]   Boast in pastors, boast in elders,
[00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:15.740]   boast in buildings, boast in anything.
[00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:19.300]   Let no one boast in men for, here's the argument,
[00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.380]   all things are yours.
[00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:24.940]   Whether Paul or Cephas or Apollos or life or death
[00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:27.460]   or the world or things to come, all are yours
[00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:30.260]   and you are Christ's and Christ is God's.
[00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:31.500]   What an argument.
[00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:36.180]   These rag tag Corinthians are being told,
[00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:40.020]   would you stop saying I'm of Paul, I'm of Cephas
[00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:43.180]   and realize you own everything.
[00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:48.520]   It's just a matter of time, very short time.
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:53.340]   Number three, God makes much of us by having us sit
[00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:58.220]   at table when he returns and serving us
[00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:03.020]   as though he were the slave and we are the masters.
[00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:07.180]   This is the parable of the second coming
[00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:09.540]   that is the most unbelievable.
[00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:13.460]   It's Luke 12, I'll just read you verse 37.
[00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:15.900]   He's describing the second coming and he says,
[00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:20.900]   "Truly I say to you, he will dress himself for service
[00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:26.940]   and have us sit at table and he will come and serve us."
[00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:31.220]   What will it take to make you feel much of?
[00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:32.460]   Feel made much of?
[00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:36.780]   I used to think until I saw that parable
[00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:40.500]   that he did that on the earth, right?
[00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:43.260]   Last supper, bound a towel, got up, washed their feet.
[00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.260]   That's an incarnation action but now,
[00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.980]   name above every name, he's coming on a white horse,
[00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:51.740]   sword out of his mouth, slaying his enemies,
[00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:54.260]   making everybody serve him at table.
[00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.180]   And that's not what it says.
[00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:03.300]   He will never cease to be our servant.
[00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:07.020]   We will tremble, we will say with Peter,
[00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:09.780]   "You can't wash my feet, get your towel off,
[00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:11.820]   I'm going to, sit down."
[00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:14.000]   And he will say, no he won't.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.300]   I wanna say he'll say, "Get behind me Satan."
[00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:20.680]   But I think probably at that point,
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:23.700]   we will be sanctified enough that we won't be satanic
[00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:24.760]   like Peter was.
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:29.660]   So there we are sitting at table,
[00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:34.660]   shortly with Jesus serving us.
[00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:35.620]   That's number three.
[00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:39.700]   Number four, God makes much of us by appointing us
[00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:42.000]   to carry out judgment of angels.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.300]   1 Corinthians 6 verse three,
[00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:50.300]   "Do you not know that we are to judge angels?"
[00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:53.260]   Take a deep breath and say,
[00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.740]   "Why I don't think I could do that."
[00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:56.740]   (laughs)
[00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:59.460]   You will, you will.
[00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:05.660]   Number five, God makes much of us by ascribing value to us
[00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:09.960]   and rejoicing over us as his treasured possession.
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:15.860]   Two verses, Matthew 10, 30, 31.
[00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:19.500]   "Are not two sparrows sold for a penny
[00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:21.620]   and not one of them will fall to the ground
[00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:23.340]   apart from your father?
[00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:27.060]   Fear not, therefore you are of more value
[00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:29.340]   than many sparrows.
[00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:32.980]   I attend to the minutest detail of a sparrow's life.
[00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:34.540]   You don't compare.
[00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:39.380]   You are, I would say, infinitely more valuable than a bird.
[00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:43.940]   So don't worry, I've got your back.
[00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:48.680]   I won't let anything happen that's not for your good.
[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:50.980]   I love you, I value you.
[00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:51.980]   You're coming home.
[00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:55.300]   I decided this before the foundation of the world."
[00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:59.900]   Number six, oh, I said there were two verses there.
[00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:03.420]   I said, "Values you and sings over you, rejoices over you."
[00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:05.360]   This is Zephaniah 3, 17.
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:08.820]   "The Lord your God will rejoice over you with gladness.
[00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:10.700]   He will quiet you by his love.
[00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:13.540]   He will exult over you with loud singing."
[00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:16.180]   You ever heard God sing?
[00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:18.580]   I haven't.
[00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:23.620]   I suppose Jesus sang a hymn when he went out
[00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:24.460]   into the garden.
[00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:27.020]   When everybody else sang, he didn't sit there quiet.
[00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:30.120]   But when God sings, universes come into being.
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:33.280]   God's gonna sing, and it's gonna be a sound
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:35.780]   like you've never heard over you.
[00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:41.660]   Over the blood-bought bride of his son.
[00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:45.220]   He will lead the song at the wedding feast.
[00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:51.980]   Number six, "God makes much of us by giving us
[00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:57.900]   a glorious body like Jesus' resurrection body.
[00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:02.600]   He will transform our lowly body to be like
[00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:04.940]   his glorious body by the power that enables him
[00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:09.160]   to subject all things to himself," Philippians 3:21.
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.160]   But here's the one that has captured me
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:14.000]   for all the years since I saw it.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.040]   In the parable in Matthew 13, 43,
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:20.600]   the righteous will shine like the sun
[00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:23.300]   in the kingdom of their father.
[00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:26.380]   Remember seeing Jesus in Revelation 1?
[00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:30.500]   Hair white like snow, girded, brass belt,
[00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:33.860]   truth, just pillars for legs, and his face,
[00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:36.900]   it says, "We're shining like the sun,"
[00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:40.080]   and John was on his face.
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:41.040]   So will you.
[00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:45.600]   We would not be able to look at each other
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:48.880]   in the resurrection unless God had given us
[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:52.640]   new spiritual resurrection eyes.
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:55.600]   We will be so bright.
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:13:00.080]   No more wheelchairs, no more depression,
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:05.000]   no more fallen countenances, no more discouragement,
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.880]   no more disease, no more alienation,
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:15.120]   everything new, and your face shining like the sun.
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:17.960]   So that C.S. Lewis said, "We would be tempted to bow down
[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:22.200]   and worship each other if God hadn't given us an eyes
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:25.160]   and a heart to know better."
[00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:31.580]   Most amazingly, I think, maybe not,
[00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:34.160]   God makes much of us by granting us to sit
[00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:36.160]   with Christ on his throne.
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:42.560]   Revelation 321, "The one who conquers,
[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:47.880]   I will grant to sit with me on my throne
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:55.920]   as I also conquered and sat down on my father's throne."
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:58.920]   I don't know what to do with that.
[00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.800]   So I'll try.
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:03.520]   Maybe Ephesians 1:23 helps.
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:08.920]   "The church is Christ's body, the fullness of him
[00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:11.680]   who fills all in all."
[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:14.240]   The fullness, meaning--
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:17.880]   OK, we're going to sit on the throne of God with Jesus
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:20.040]   because the thrones merge.
[00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:21.120]   We're on Jesus' throne.
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.400]   He sits on the father's throne.
[00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:26.640]   Now we're all on the same throne, God, the son, and us
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:29.960]   sitting on the throne of the universe.
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.320]   If I put those two texts together,
[00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:33.720]   I think it means something like everywhere
[00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:36.720]   the father extends his rule in the universe,
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:39.600]   he will do it through you.
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:44.800]   God created the world, you, for a reason.
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:47.280]   And it isn't to throw you away at the end.
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:48.800]   It's so that you would fulfill what
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:50.280]   he gave you to do in the beginning,
[00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:52.280]   namely to be a governor of the universe.
[00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:56.400]   Subdue it, multiply, fill it, enjoy it, make something of it.
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:57.320]   Now I've made you new.
[00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:58.320]   I'll make the world new.
[00:14:58.320 --> 00:14:59.320]   Now get about it.
[00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:02.120]   And any place I stick my hand to rule,
[00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:03.880]   I'm ruling through people.
[00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:04.880]   I'm ruling.
[00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:08.680]   He's going through people.
[00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:14.640]   So let it be known loud and clear, God makes much of us.
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:17.840]   God makes much of his son's bride.
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:20.560]   God loves his church with a kind of love
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:27.440]   that will make more of her because he makes much of her
[00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:30.320]   for his glory.
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:31.680]   Stunning, so rich.
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:36.040]   This is from John Piper's April 18, 2010 sermon on Psalm 79,
[00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:39.600]   titled "How Much Does God Love This Church?"
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:40.880]   The whole thing is online.
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:42.260]   I'd encourage you to listen to it.
[00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:43.160]   I found this clip.
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:44.720]   But if you find one, email it to me.
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:47.560]   Give me your name, hometown, the sermon title, the time stamp
[00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:48.840]   of where the clip happens in the audio,
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:51.240]   and make a note of what stands out to you in the clip.
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:53.320]   Put the word "clip" in the subject line of the email
[00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:56.680]   and send it to me at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:02.040]   That's an email address, askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:04.540]   Well, we're going to end the week with a heartbreaking email
[00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:06.880]   from a young woman recently widowed.
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:09.740]   And she may be newly widowed because she
[00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:15.840]   made a bad medical decision about her husband's sickness.
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:16.840]   He's now gone.
[00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:20.160]   And she's now left with a very heavy burden on her soul.
[00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:21.880]   And she writes in for counsel.
[00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:24.640]   Pastor John will answer that when he returns to the studio
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:26.600]   with us on Friday.
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:28.600]   We'll see you then.
[00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:31.960]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:35.320]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:37.380]   you
