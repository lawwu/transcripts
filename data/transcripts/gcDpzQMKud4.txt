[00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.540]   I greatly enjoyed my conversation with J.L.
[00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.140]   and hope you do too.
[00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.820]   So with no further ado, let me introduce J.L. Collins.
[00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.580]   Welcome to the "Bogleheads on Investing" podcast.
[00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.460]   Rick, thank you for the invitation.
[00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:50.740]   I'm delighted to be here.
[00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.140]   Well, I'm great to finally have a chance
[00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.420]   to sit down and talk with you about your books
[00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.580]   and all the work that you've done on simple investing
[00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.140]   and with the FIRE movement, which
[00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.140]   we'll get into in a little bit.
[00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.140]   But before we do that, you and I are close to the same age.
[00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.740]   And let's say that we're on Medicare.
[00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.220]   And so before either one of us got
[00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.660]   into talking about investment things and finance things,
[00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:21.620]   we did other things.
[00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.580]   So could you tell us a little bit about your journey
[00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.820]   and what brought you to this career
[00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.300]   and what you did before then in your younger days?
[00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.700]   You're talking about my professional career
[00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.180]   in my younger days?
[00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.780]   Your professional life before you became a financial guru.
[00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.260]   Wow, I cringed at the term guru, but--
[00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.300]   Oh, OK, well, I take that back.
[00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.100]   Yeah, I just take that back.
[00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.980]   I thank you for it.
[00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.460]   That's a nice compliment.
[00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.180]   No, I was in the magazine publishing business
[00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.820]   until 2011 is when I finally left my last corporate job
[00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.260]   in business-to-business magazines.
[00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.140]   I started on the sales side, and then I became a publisher
[00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.260]   and wound up my career back in the sales side of things.
[00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.460]   And you were an English major back in college.
[00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.420]   I was an English major, absolutely.
[00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.420]   Well, that certainly comes out in your writing,
[00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.340]   because when I read anything that you wrote,
[00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.500]   it's so crystal clear, unambiguous.
[00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.980]   You have a really great talent for writing,
[00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.020]   making very complex things simple.
[00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.780]   You're very kind to say that.
[00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.500]   Actually, I would say that I got my start writing,
[00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.020]   I suppose, as an English major.
[00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:37.140]   But to the extent that I have any ability in writing,
[00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.500]   I think it was a skill I developed in business,
[00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.460]   writing business letters and proposals
[00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:43.980]   and that kind of thing, where you do
[00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.580]   have to be clear and succinct.
[00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.260]   And so, yeah, I think to the extent
[00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.780]   that I have that ability, I actually honed it
[00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.540]   in my decades in business.
[00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.500]   You wrote The Simple Path to Wealth,
[00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.780]   and you've sold half a million copies,
[00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.580]   and it's still selling strong.
[00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.420]   I found myself the other day when a client of mine
[00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:07.240]   asked me, my young son has just graduated from college.
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.820]   Can you recommend a book?
[00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.440]   The first one that came out of my mouth
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.460]   was The Simple Path to Wealth, because it's so easy to read.
[00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:16.620]   It's a great book for people who are just getting started.
[00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.500]   It clears up a lot of misconceptions.
[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.980]   In fact, when I read all of the accolades in your book
[00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.900]   from the various financial bloggers out there,
[00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.460]   everyone said the same thing.
[00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:27.620]   That you were able to take something
[00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.060]   that was very complex and make it very simple
[00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.900]   for somebody who is new to all this
[00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.860]   and overwhelmed by all of the acronyms and terms
[00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.800]   and all the stuff that Wall Street throws at you.
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.140]   You're able to cut through all of that,
[00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.840]   just get right down to the bottom line
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.760]   with the way you write, and that comes out very clearly
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.140]   in The Simple Path to Wealth,
[00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:49.660]   which we'll get into in a minute.
[00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.600]   Before we get there, I do have some more questions
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.420]   about the earlier background, and I'd like to hear about
[00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:00.100]   how you ended up coming to the altar, if you will,
[00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:04.300]   of index investing and all of the mistakes du jour
[00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.380]   that you may have made prior to getting there.
[00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.220]   - Yeah, well, the answer to that question
[00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:12.560]   is kind of embarrassing.
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:19.060]   Strictly by chance, I started investing in 1975,
[00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.380]   and that was, of course, the year that Jack Bogle
[00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.180]   brought out the very first index fund.
[00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.660]   My excuse for not investing in it right away
[00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.940]   is that I just didn't know that.
[00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.300]   But about 10 years later, in the mid '80s,
[00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.220]   a friend of mine who was a financial analyst
[00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.020]   and I were talking, and he was the one
[00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.980]   who introduced me to this whole concept
[00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:44.280]   of indexing, investing in efficient markets
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.120]   and all that kind of stuff.
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.180]   I was a stock picker in those days,
[00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.580]   and by extension, I would pick actively managed funds
[00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.620]   that were run by stock pickers.
[00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.100]   And actually, I did pretty well.
[00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:58.580]   In fact, my dirty little secret
[00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.160]   is I achieved financial independence doing that,
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.380]   not through indexing.
[00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.140]   So the key is it's not like picking stocks
[00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.740]   or active management doesn't work.
[00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:14.100]   It's just that indexing works better, more easily,
[00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.740]   and it's a whole lot less expensive.
[00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:18.920]   So I learned about it in the mid '80s,
[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.580]   but I was not smart enough,
[00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.060]   candidly, to make the change then.
[00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:26.700]   It took me another probably 15 years,
[00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:31.700]   probably not until 2000 before I switched over to indexing.
[00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:35.540]   And it was a slow transition.
[00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.260]   I think pretty quickly, once I embraced it,
[00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.100]   indexing was doing the heavy lifting,
[00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.980]   but I probably, I'm trying to think
[00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:45.500]   of the last individual stock I owned,
[00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:50.120]   was probably as recently as 2013, somewhere in there.
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.160]   So I had and have the disease.
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.020]   I'm kind of a recovering stock picker.
[00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:58.340]   - You know, it's interesting that you said
[00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.340]   it took you about 15 years.
[00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:03.900]   It's not unusual, and I hate using double negatives,
[00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:07.900]   for someone to hear about indexing
[00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:12.180]   and not right away have that aha moment.
[00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:15.500]   It took me, I mean, I worked in the industry
[00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:19.780]   for eight years before I had my aha moment.
[00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:22.660]   And prior to that, I was also trying to figure out
[00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:24.680]   which mutual funds were going to outperform,
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:29.380]   and I had my bout of picking bad stocks and all of that.
[00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:31.740]   Oh, you know, you hear about indexing.
[00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:33.540]   You're like, okay, it's there.
[00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:36.580]   It doesn't really mean that much.
[00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:38.180]   Got to go on to the next thing.
[00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:39.300]   And then you circle back.
[00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:42.220]   In fact, I didn't really embrace indexing
[00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:45.420]   until I had read every other book out there on investing.
[00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:47.340]   And finally, the last book on the bookshelf
[00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:49.860]   at Barnes and Noble was Jack Bogle's book,
[00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:51.820]   "Bogle on Mutual Funds."
[00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:54.860]   And that was in 1996, and then I picked up that book
[00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:57.400]   and finally read it, and then it finally dawned on me.
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:58.500]   I had my aha moment.
[00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:02.660]   It's like, hey, wow, this is pretty powerful stuff.
[00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:05.320]   You know, I was a financial advisor at the time,
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.700]   and you must have worked with some financial advisors
[00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:09.500]   during your lifetime as well, correct?
[00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:10.780]   I don't, never have.
[00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:11.700]   Oh, good for you.
[00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:13.260]   Yeah, yep.
[00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260]   That's one disease I've never had.
[00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:16.100]   Okay.
[00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:19.220]   Well, you have some things to say
[00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:21.100]   about financial advisors in your book,
[00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:24.100]   and it all centers around the same thing that I talk about.
[00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:26.660]   And I am a financial advisor, been one for 35 years,
[00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:31.660]   but you talk about the complexity of the industry
[00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:34.900]   and how that might be intentional.
[00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:36.620]   Can you elaborate on that?
[00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:39.460]   Well, yeah, I think that just in general,
[00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:42.900]   I think one of the reasons that most people
[00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:44.980]   are intimidated by investing
[00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:49.040]   is that there's a lot of jargon surrounding it.
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:54.040]   And Wall Street is filled with genuinely complex investments.
[00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:56.740]   I mean, they've created investments notoriously
[00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:59.820]   when it led up to the '08, '09 crash
[00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:02.300]   that they didn't understand themselves,
[00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:04.660]   and they were still selling and marketing
[00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:07.420]   to people who obviously didn't understand them either.
[00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:09.660]   And these were professionals.
[00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:12.900]   And I think that happens for a couple of reasons.
[00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:15.020]   One, the more complex an investment is,
[00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:17.700]   the more you could charge for it.
[00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:20.780]   And the more you can convince people
[00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:25.420]   that you just need to go with the program and pay our fees,
[00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:26.460]   and we'll take care of it,
[00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:28.500]   and don't worry your pretty little head about it.
[00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:31.100]   But I contend that the vast majority,
[00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:32.420]   in fact, not the vast majority,
[00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:36.020]   I'll go so far as to say 100% of those complex things,
[00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:38.580]   you can put your arm on the table
[00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:40.940]   and sweep them all onto the floor
[00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:42.780]   and leave only that corner
[00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:46.980]   with the simple, broad-based, low-cost index funds,
[00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:49.460]   because that's all you need.
[00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:51.260]   I've been asked in the past,
[00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.540]   "Why is your advice so specific?"
[00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:56.700]   And it's, "Well, it's because I'm writing for my daughter.
[00:09:56.700 --> 00:10:00.380]   "This is exactly what I tell my kid to do.
[00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:03.620]   "It's about what kicked me in the ass and what's worked."
[00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:06.140]   - You just recently wrote another book, though,
[00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:07.900]   on real estate investing.
[00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:12.900]   And there, harking back to your previous investments,
[00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:16.140]   it was titled "How I Lost Money in Real Estate
[00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:18.020]   "Before It Was Fashionable."
[00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:20.980]   And you wrote that back in 2021.
[00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:23.780]   And it talks about your trials and tribulations
[00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:25.700]   in the renter real estate market,
[00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:28.180]   buying real estate and as a landlord.
[00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:29.940]   Tell us why you wrote that book
[00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:32.460]   and what were some of the main points of it.
[00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:35.620]   - So I wrote that book because it was kind of fun
[00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:40.620]   and it's illustrated with some humorous illustrations.
[00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:44.220]   So it was, I wrote it to amuse myself,
[00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:47.340]   but also the subtitle is "A Cautionary Tale."
[00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:50.460]   It's the story of the first piece of real estate
[00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:52.860]   I ever bought, which was a condominium.
[00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:56.100]   And it was an unmitigated disaster
[00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:58.300]   from the moment I bought it
[00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:00.500]   until the moment I finally got rid of it.
[00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:02.180]   And in that period of time,
[00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:05.460]   it was my personal residence initially.
[00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:08.380]   And then when, for a variety of reasons,
[00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:11.140]   it was time to move on from there, I was stuck with it
[00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:14.300]   because the condo market in Chicago had crashed.
[00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:17.220]   And so then it became a default rental.
[00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:19.220]   And there are a few worse ways
[00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:22.780]   to get into rental real estate than by default.
[00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:26.260]   So it was, you know, hemorrhaging cash every month
[00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:30.220]   in what I've learned since was called an alligator.
[00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:31.860]   Alligator is a real estate investment
[00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:33.900]   that's eating you alive.
[00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:37.460]   Real estate can be a wonderful investment done correctly.
[00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:39.020]   And if you know what you're doing
[00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:40.580]   and you operate it as a business,
[00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:44.020]   but I cringe at some of the advice that's out there
[00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:47.540]   and this common attitude that it is easy
[00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:52.340]   and that it's a slam dunk, and it's not.
[00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:56.340]   I mean, you know, real estate can be deadly to your wealth,
[00:11:56.340 --> 00:12:00.100]   but if you take the time to learn how to do it properly
[00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:04.980]   and you go into it intentionally looking
[00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:07.420]   at whatever you're buying as an investment
[00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:10.220]   that meets certain financial parameters,
[00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:13.100]   then yeah, that can work out very well.
[00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:16.220]   If you did it the way I did it that first time,
[00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:17.420]   yeah, not so much.
[00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:19.860]   And in my defense, by the way,
[00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:21.500]   I did learn from that experience
[00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:24.500]   and I continued investing in real estate for a little while
[00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:26.900]   and did much better on those things.
[00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:30.220]   But eventually I decided it's just way too much like work
[00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:33.740]   for my taste and I haven't owned investment
[00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:35.660]   in real estate in decades.
[00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:39.740]   - A lot of people become interested in real estate
[00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:44.540]   because they hear that you can get really great returns
[00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:48.500]   from rental properties and that it is a diversification,
[00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:50.700]   which it's true, both of those things are true.
[00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:55.180]   But when I asked them, "So do you want to be a landlord?"
[00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:58.380]   They say, "No, not particularly."
[00:12:58.380 --> 00:12:59.900]   And I said, "Well, okay."
[00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:01.980]   I mean, have you ever been a landlord?
[00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:03.540]   And they said, "No, never have."
[00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:06.060]   How good are you at fixing plumbing?
[00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:08.940]   Not at all, right?
[00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:10.700]   And I said, "Okay, well, you might wanna think twice
[00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:12.820]   about getting into real estate
[00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:15.700]   just because it sounds like it's a great investment."
[00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:18.100]   And there are other ways of doing real estate
[00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:19.540]   through syndicated deals
[00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:22.220]   and you could do real estate investment trust mutual funds.
[00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:24.420]   So I mean, if you really want to be in real estate,
[00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:25.300]   there's other ways.
[00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:28.140]   But I do have these conversations a lot with people
[00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:30.500]   who, in my opinion, when I talk with them,
[00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:32.260]   I don't really think they should be
[00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:33.300]   getting into that industry.
[00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:34.980]   And a lot of them do have to back into it.
[00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:36.980]   Like you said, there's a piece of property
[00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:41.180]   that didn't get sold, usually in a different city,
[00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:43.100]   sometimes in a different state,
[00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:45.860]   and they're trying to manage this piece of property.
[00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:50.020]   And it's just, it can be very difficult to do.
[00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:51.900]   - Yeah, that wound up being exactly my case
[00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:53.100]   with this condo.
[00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:57.020]   I also wound up, for job career reasons,
[00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:58.380]   moving away from Chicago.
[00:13:58.380 --> 00:13:59.820]   So suddenly I owned this thing
[00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:01.940]   that at the time was unsellable.
[00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:04.580]   I couldn't even get a real estate agent
[00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:05.780]   to take the listing.
[00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:08.660]   If you know anything about real estate,
[00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:10.260]   you know that real estate agents
[00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.540]   fall all over themselves to take a listing.
[00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:16.740]   But condos in Chicago were so depressed in those days
[00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:19.340]   that they wouldn't even take the listing.
[00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:21.220]   - What you just hit on with the fact
[00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:24.580]   that the market in real estate was so bad
[00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:27.220]   that you couldn't even get a real estate agent
[00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:28.820]   to take the listing.
[00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:31.180]   You know, you write a lot to the FIRE community,
[00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:34.740]   and they're generally younger investors,
[00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:37.620]   people who are, you know, in their 30s,
[00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:39.420]   perhaps 40s, even their 20s.
[00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:43.100]   And they're looking to become financially independent,
[00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:45.300]   not necessarily retire early.
[00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:46.460]   But they hear the stories,
[00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:49.420]   and they've seen only really a bull market in real estate
[00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:53.260]   for the past 15 years after the financial crisis,
[00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:57.020]   and haven't really seen what you saw
[00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:58.900]   where there are real estate markets
[00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:00.740]   where there's no market.
[00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:02.260]   - You're absolutely right.
[00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:04.180]   You know, and of course,
[00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:06.940]   what you typically hear out there
[00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:08.900]   from people touting real estate
[00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:12.300]   is the places in the country where it's done really well.
[00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:14.900]   Obviously, if you bought San Francisco 10 years ago,
[00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:15.820]   you've done well.
[00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:19.180]   If you bought Detroit, you know, not so much.
[00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:21.820]   And there have also been times in history,
[00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:26.820]   like Chicago back in the late '70s, early '80s,
[00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:28.460]   when I had this condo
[00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:30.180]   where the condo market in particular
[00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:32.740]   was just, didn't exist.
[00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:35.580]   Younger people don't necessarily have the experience
[00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:38.900]   or even the awareness that that has happened in the past
[00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:40.740]   and can happen in the future.
[00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:42.340]   - Let's move on to your writing.
[00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:45.740]   You started your blog in 2011,
[00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:50.180]   and it was because you were trying to give your daughter
[00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:51.980]   good financial advice.
[00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:53.980]   But why start the blog, though, to do that?
[00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:56.660]   I mean, couldn't you just hand her a piece of paper?
[00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:59.420]   - Well, handing her a piece of paper,
[00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:02.540]   or more specifically, a series of piece of paper,
[00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:04.180]   was actually the plan.
[00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:07.940]   I had managed to turn her off to all things financial
[00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:09.220]   when she was young.
[00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:10.060]   (laughing)
[00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:12.580]   I just pushed it too hard and too fast,
[00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:13.580]   'cause it's so important.
[00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:15.780]   You know, if you get this stuff right,
[00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:17.460]   your life is so much better.
[00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:18.820]   It's so much easier.
[00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:20.900]   You have so many more options.
[00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:24.100]   And if you get money wrong in our modern world,
[00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:26.900]   your life is real hard.
[00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:29.300]   So, you know, obviously, like every parent,
[00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:31.060]   I want it the best for my kid,
[00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:33.140]   and I just pushed it too hard.
[00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:36.180]   So I found that she stopped listening to me,
[00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:38.900]   and I had started to write this stuff down
[00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:42.420]   so it would be available to her, even if I wasn't,
[00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:43.820]   at some point in the future
[00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:46.740]   when hopefully she would be able to hear it.
[00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:49.700]   And a friend of mine that I shared it with said,
[00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:50.900]   you know, this is kind of interesting.
[00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:52.820]   You ought to put this on a blog
[00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:54.940]   and share it with your friends and family.
[00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:59.380]   And I'd never actually seen a blog before.
[00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:03.100]   I'd heard of them, so I kind of knew what they were.
[00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:04.340]   But what appealed to me
[00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:06.660]   was not sharing it with my friends and family,
[00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:08.020]   although I did that.
[00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:10.540]   This is a great way to archive this information
[00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:13.100]   in a way that'll be readily accessible to her,
[00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:15.500]   to my daughter when the time comes.
[00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:17.780]   So that's why I chose to put it on a blog.
[00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:20.540]   And I never, never in my wildest dreams
[00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:24.540]   did I think that people who didn't know me
[00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:27.220]   would become my audience for this material.
[00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:30.140]   You know, I sent the link, when I put the blog up,
[00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:32.300]   I sent a link to it around to friends and family,
[00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:34.700]   and of course, none of them cared.
[00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:38.180]   But then, you know, it started to develop traction
[00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:43.180]   with the wider world, and I still am amazed by that.
[00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:46.020]   But it's been a very gratifying journey.
[00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:47.980]   - Well, yeah, your followers,
[00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:52.780]   many of them from the FIRE movement, as I said earlier,
[00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:55.940]   financial independence, retire early.
[00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:56.900]   You and I are alike.
[00:17:56.900 --> 00:18:00.140]   I think that financial independence is so important,
[00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:03.060]   but retiring early, not so much important.
[00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:05.300]   I mean, you're still working, I'm still working.
[00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:06.420]   But, you know, the FIRE movement,
[00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:08.660]   like we said, are a lot of younger people,
[00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:13.060]   and they took everything you wrote, and they adopted it,
[00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:14.820]   or it was already being adopted,
[00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:19.740]   and you just added some fuel to the fire, pardon the pun.
[00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:20.740]   You know, how did they find you?
[00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:25.660]   I mean, all of the people who wrote comments in your book
[00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:29.700]   were all young FIRE enthusiasts,
[00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:32.020]   like Mr. Money Mustache, and so forth.
[00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:35.780]   And they found you, and they started touting you,
[00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:37.800]   and publishing you, or republishing,
[00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:39.620]   and telling people about you.
[00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:41.260]   It must have been interesting for you
[00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:44.180]   to become involved with these young people
[00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:45.940]   when that was all going on.
[00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:48.660]   - Yeah, it's been wonderful.
[00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:51.700]   I now have friendships with many of these people,
[00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:55.260]   and I don't think there are very many people my age
[00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:59.140]   who have friends who are in their 20s, or 30s, or 40s.
[00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:01.820]   So it's been an incredibly gratifying journey.
[00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:04.140]   It's also led to my third book,
[00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:08.340]   which I just finished the manuscript on a week ago,
[00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:10.020]   and that's "Pathfinders."
[00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:10.860]   - Oh.
[00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:13.260]   - We can talk about it later, but if you want.
[00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:14.100]   - Sure.
[00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:16.060]   - But yeah, it's been an incredible journey,
[00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:17.820]   and one that I didn't anticipate.
[00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:22.540]   I think the main driver of the blog developing an audience
[00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:25.500]   was when I started writing my blog,
[00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:28.380]   I started paying attention to some of the other blogs
[00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:31.660]   that were out there, and I came across Mr. Money Mustache.
[00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:35.660]   And I liked his work, and I would make some comments
[00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:39.540]   on some of his posts, and evidently he liked the comments
[00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:41.220]   because one day he reached out to me,
[00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:45.260]   and he asked me if I would do a guest post on his blog.
[00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:48.700]   And to give you an idea of how ignorant I was
[00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:51.020]   of blogging and the whole concept,
[00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:54.000]   my initial reaction to that was, I didn't say this to him,
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.100]   but I'm thinking, "Of course not.
[00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:58.720]   "If I'm gonna write a post, I'm gonna put it on my blog.
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:02.580]   "Why would I write a post and put it on your blog, right?"
[00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:04.940]   I know that displays an appalling level of ignorance,
[00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:07.940]   but there you go, and that's where I was.
[00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:09.740]   But finally, I reached out to him.
[00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:11.620]   I said, "Well, what exactly do you have in mind?"
[00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:13.580]   He said, "Well, you know, you're older
[00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:15.260]   "than most of the people reading this,
[00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:18.100]   "and you've already walked the path,
[00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:22.340]   "and maybe just sort of talk about that."
[00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:24.540]   And the title of my guest post was,
[00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:28.460]   "It's Never Been About Retirement," to our previous thing,
[00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:31.900]   'cause for me, it never has been about retirement.
[00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:36.900]   And I think that guest post, well, I remember I sent to him
[00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:40.100]   and I said, "Is this kind of what you have in mind?"
[00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:41.020]   He said, "Yeah, this is great.
[00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:43.660]   "I'm gonna put it up on Sunday."
[00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:45.140]   And this was probably on a Thursday,
[00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:47.220]   and I emailed him back, said, "Great."
[00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:49.860]   And then Monday, it suddenly occurred,
[00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:53.680]   "Oh, I wonder if Pete ever put it up on his blog."
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:55.700]   And I logged onto my blog.
[00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:57.940]   Well, my traffic had exploded.
[00:20:57.940 --> 00:20:59.260]   - (laughs) Okay.
[00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:01.380]   - And then suddenly I realized why it's a good idea
[00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:04.260]   to do guest posts on incredibly popular blogs
[00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:06.580]   if you're offered the opportunity.
[00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:08.140]   But yeah, I think that was the beginning
[00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:13.060]   of my blog getting extended traction in the wider world.
[00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:15.060]   - And then you had more and more followers,
[00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:17.900]   and it grew and grew, and then you decided,
[00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:19.980]   "I had enough material.
[00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:22.260]   "I need to put together a book."
[00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:26.220]   And so what was the idea of this paperback book?
[00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:27.460]   What was the idea of doing that?
[00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:30.340]   - I think the idea behind that was twofold.
[00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:34.700]   One, my overarching goal for all of this
[00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:37.940]   is to have this information available to my daughter,
[00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:42.140]   so I had a lot of this information on the blog
[00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:44.860]   that had kind of developed organically,
[00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:48.020]   and I thought, "Wow, I do have the material for a book,
[00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:49.540]   "and I can pull this book together
[00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:52.320]   "and make it more concise, better organized,
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:54.420]   "polish the writing a bit,
[00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:59.180]   "and now I can have a book that I can hand her,"
[00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:01.820]   in addition to access to the blog.
[00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:06.100]   And the other factor was I'd always harbored
[00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:08.100]   an ambition to write a book,
[00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:09.700]   probably since my days of being
[00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:12.060]   an English major at university,
[00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:17.060]   and suddenly I had the subject and the material to do it,
[00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:20.340]   so there you go.
[00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:21.560]   - Yeah, it's great.
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:24.780]   Books that are personal finance books
[00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:28.340]   tend to maybe sell, if you're lucky, 5,000 copies,
[00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:31.460]   and you've sold, I know, at least a half a million.
[00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:35.260]   - I never dreamed it would be as well-received as it was.
[00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:37.660]   I was just hoping my daughter would read it.
[00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:39.560]   - So have you sold the movie rights yet?
[00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:43.240]   - (laughs) Well, no, and nobody's offered to buy them.
[00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:45.280]   - (laughs) Okay.
[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:46.620]   - I hope to sell the movie rights,
[00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:50.540]   'cause Brad Pitt keeps bugging me to play the lead role,
[00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:52.140]   and I keep telling Brad,
[00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:54.500]   "Just 'cause we look alike doesn't mean you're the right."
[00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:58.060]   - (laughs) Okay.
[00:22:58.060 --> 00:22:59.900]   In preparing for the podcast, of course,
[00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:02.600]   I go back and take a look at all the notes that I took,
[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:06.160]   and as I started to redo the book again,
[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:08.880]   I realized I didn't have to go very far.
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:13.880]   I mean, you very conveniently put the key information
[00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:16.860]   in the first three pages, which I really appreciate.
[00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:18.080]   - (laughs)
[00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:20.160]   - Do you not want people to read this book,
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:21.960]   because all I have to do is read these pages,
[00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:23.160]   and it tells me everything that I need to know.
[00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:24.160]   - Oh, yeah, you just stand in the bookstore
[00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:25.780]   and read for a couple of pages.
[00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:28.760]   - (laughs) Right, I said, "This is not good marketing.
[00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:30.040]   "I mean, you're not supposed to do this."
[00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:31.620]   You know, you're supposed to wait to the last chapter
[00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:33.560]   to find out what the conclusion is.
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:34.840]   I mean, as I read through these,
[00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:39.000]   it occurred to me very clearly that your ideas
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.440]   and the Boglehead's ideas
[00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:43.340]   are very much aligned with everything.
[00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:45.120]   Starting out right from the beginning,
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:48.680]   we have this 10 things that make you a Boglehead,
[00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:50.040]   and you can see it on video,
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:52.280]   you can see it on the boglehead.org website,
[00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:53.900]   on boglecenter.net.
[00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:55.240]   It's just these 10 things,
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:57.760]   and all 10 of those things are in your list.
[00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:01.820]   So we are right in line with thinking.
[00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:02.740]   But the first thing you have,
[00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:04.060]   and I just want to go over a few of these,
[00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:06.100]   and you could elaborate on them,
[00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:09.140]   is there's a few key things
[00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:12.940]   that make you good with money, good with money.
[00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:15.540]   And I think that the very first one you put up here
[00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:17.880]   is spend less than you earn,
[00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:20.380]   invest the surplus, avoid debt.
[00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:22.020]   Now, there's three different things there.
[00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:22.860]   - Right.
[00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:24.880]   - You know, comment on your first point,
[00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:26.460]   and then we can go to other points.
[00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:28.960]   - Yeah, I mean, that's the formula.
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:31.720]   And I say in the book
[00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:34.040]   that if you do just those three things,
[00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:35.200]   you'll wind up wealthy,
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:37.280]   and not just in money.
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:39.200]   You'll wind up wealthy in life
[00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:41.520]   if you live below your means,
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:44.160]   invest the surplus, and avoid debt.
[00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:46.480]   And of course, avoid debt is the first step,
[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:49.080]   and then, but yeah, that's the formula.
[00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:50.720]   - And then put something in here
[00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:54.040]   that needs to be said,
[00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:57.380]   although a lot of people would never say it.
[00:24:57.380 --> 00:24:58.900]   Like, I think the benefit that we have
[00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:02.100]   of being in our Medicare and overage
[00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:03.140]   is that we can say things
[00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:05.680]   and people let us get away with it, right?
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:07.100]   (laughs)
[00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:08.980]   But you put here,
[00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:13.300]   avoid fiscally irresponsible people.
[00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:14.940]   Never marry one,
[00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:19.820]   or otherwise give him or her access to your money.
[00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:21.700]   That was brilliant.
[00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:23.180]   I mean, I don't know even today
[00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:24.520]   if I would actually say that,
[00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:25.760]   but I guess I could,
[00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:28.460]   given my advancing age.
[00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:30.380]   But tell us about this.
[00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:31.700]   - You know, so first of all,
[00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:33.980]   I appreciate the comment that it's brilliant.
[00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:37.540]   To me, it just seems painfully obvious.
[00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:40.500]   And the idea that it would be controversial to say it
[00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:43.020]   is, it strikes me as odd,
[00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:44.100]   but you're not wrong.
[00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:48.480]   I have gotten pushback on that very comment.
[00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:50.100]   There was one woman in particular,
[00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:53.140]   I forget what format it might have been,
[00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:54.100]   but on my blog,
[00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:56.300]   or probably was a comment on the blog,
[00:25:56.300 --> 00:26:00.140]   but you know, she said something effective.
[00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:01.580]   You lost me immediately.
[00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:04.460]   You know, the only reason to get married is for love
[00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:06.940]   and money should have nothing to do with it
[00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:07.780]   or something like that.
[00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:10.180]   She was very incensed.
[00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:11.940]   But of course the truth is that
[00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:14.060]   if there are problems in a marriage,
[00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:15.980]   money is the most often,
[00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:19.060]   the most common of all causes of that.
[00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:21.980]   If you and your spouse are not on the same page
[00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:25.000]   when it comes to how you spend and invest your money,
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.460]   it's going to be an incredibly difficult path.
[00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:29.780]   And if God forbid,
[00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:34.220]   you're married to someone who squanders your money,
[00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:35.420]   that's a leaky bucket.
[00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:36.900]   You're never going to be able to fill.
[00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:38.420]   I said it, I stand by it.
[00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:41.860]   I certainly, it's the advice I give my daughter
[00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:43.960]   and it's the advice I would give anybody.
[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:48.540]   And, but it's not advice that everybody wants to hear
[00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:50.580]   or agrees with.
[00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:54.060]   The next one is something that I agree with,
[00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:56.420]   even though I am one.
[00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:59.180]   And I've been one for 35 years.
[00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:02.140]   It says avoid investment advisors.
[00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:06.440]   Too many have only their own interest at heart.
[00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:07.340]   And then you go on to say,
[00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:10.500]   by the time you know enough to pick a good one,
[00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:13.020]   you know enough to handle your finances yourself.
[00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:16.600]   It's your money and no one will care for it better than you.
[00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:17.660]   Absolutely true.
[00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:19.580]   I mean, you're not going to hurt my feelings.
[00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:21.980]   Go ahead and tell me about investment advisors.
[00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:24.260]   Well, I think that pretty much summed it up.
[00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:26.480]   You know, one thing I will add is
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:30.020]   during that, the big crash in '08, '09,
[00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:32.780]   one of the arguments for investment advisors
[00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:36.100]   that I've heard from investment advisors, not surprisingly,
[00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:38.460]   is that, well, okay, you know, maybe we're expensive
[00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:42.460]   and maybe we're not offering investments
[00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:45.820]   that you couldn't do less expensively on your own.
[00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:48.820]   But, but boy, when the market crashes, you know,
[00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:50.620]   we're going to be the one holding your hand
[00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:52.180]   and telling you to stay the course
[00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:55.380]   and keeping you from making a mistake.
[00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:56.220]   Well.
[00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:57.060]   Absolutely.
[00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:57.880]   Yeah.
[00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:59.700]   You better, you better pay us a lot of money to do that.
[00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:02.380]   But it turns out, at least statistically speaking,
[00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:03.380]   that's not true.
[00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:04.420]   Investment advisors.
[00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:05.260]   Oh, what?
[00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:08.420]   Investment advisors actually panic more readily
[00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:10.060]   than their clients.
[00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:11.500]   I am shocked.
[00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:13.580]   So, yeah, I,
[00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:18.060]   so now I'm going to go a little bit positive
[00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:19.180]   on investment advisors.
[00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:23.420]   If you have a specific issue that you're dealing with
[00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:26.460]   and you want some professional advice,
[00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:28.660]   then an advisor can be useful.
[00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:31.620]   I think you should find one that charges by the hour
[00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:35.100]   and pay for the advice that you want.
[00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:37.060]   That was not a paid advertisement, by the way.
[00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:38.780]   No, not a paid advertisement at all.
[00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:40.180]   (laughing)
[00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:42.620]   I've had a lot of advisors tell me, you know,
[00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:47.020]   JL, this hourly thing is, you know, that's a good idea
[00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:48.580]   and maybe that's best for the clients,
[00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:51.140]   but the clients don't like it, you know,
[00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:53.580]   because they see that when I send them the bill.
[00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:57.700]   You know, if I'm charging them a fee that comes out,
[00:28:57.700 --> 00:29:00.140]   you know, that's, they, it might be a lot more money for me,
[00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:02.140]   but they don't see it and they're more comfortable with it.
[00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:03.540]   No, that's a bunch of nonsense.
[00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:06.780]   So I sort of understand the advisors saying,
[00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:09.060]   well, you know, I can go for this,
[00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:12.840]   I can charge fees that the customer really doesn't see
[00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:15.860]   that put a lot more money in my pocket,
[00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:18.040]   or I can charge an hourly amount
[00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:19.740]   that's less money to the customer,
[00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:22.380]   but that they do see and that they're gonna complain about.
[00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:23.220]   (laughing)
[00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:25.180]   You know, I mean, I can kind of see it
[00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:26.760]   from the advisor's point of view too,
[00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:29.180]   but I'm not writing for advisors,
[00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:31.220]   I'm writing for the clients.
[00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:33.780]   - Well, sure, you're writing for individual investors.
[00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:36.780]   And by the way, I mean, the whole bogal head
[00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:39.680]   is about, you know, individuals managing their own money,
[00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:42.220]   basically, although there are some who will use an advisor
[00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:45.140]   and some who need an advisor for various reasons,
[00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:47.780]   because they need to have a professional
[00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:52.320]   by the trust document or whatever particular document
[00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:53.660]   is driving those investments.
[00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:54.980]   Or maybe they've come of age
[00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:57.900]   where they can no longer manage their own portfolio,
[00:29:57.900 --> 00:29:58.900]   they don't feel comfortable,
[00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:01.200]   there might be some cognitive decline there,
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:02.980]   and they're worried about their spouse
[00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:04.540]   or their family managing the money.
[00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:08.220]   So they find an advisor that is reasonably priced,
[00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:10.460]   maybe a flat fee advisor who'll manage the money
[00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:14.020]   for a low fee, you know, using the same ideas that they have.
[00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:16.660]   So, and most people probably listen to this podcast
[00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:17.580]   are gonna do it themselves,
[00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:21.140]   but there are reasons why people hire an advisor,
[00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:25.700]   but they do need to look for the one that fits their need.
[00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:26.700]   - Right.
[00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:28.740]   - Let me go on to the next thing.
[00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:33.740]   You own the things you own, and they in turn own you.
[00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:35.860]   Now, a lot of people talk about boats,
[00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:38.100]   but I think you're talking about a lot of things.
[00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:38.940]   - Right.
[00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:39.900]   - Could you elaborate on that one?
[00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:42.380]   - Owning things takes time and energy.
[00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:44.820]   And the more things you own,
[00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:48.060]   the more of your life they occupy.
[00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:50.420]   And, you know, the title of my book
[00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:52.900]   is "The Simple Path to Wealth."
[00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:56.100]   I believe in simplicity in life, you know,
[00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:59.460]   in organizing my finances the way I have.
[00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:03.020]   When I pass on, it will be a lot easier
[00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:05.980]   for my wife and my daughter,
[00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:09.980]   because I don't have a multiple houses.
[00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:13.620]   I don't have boats, I don't have all this stuff.
[00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:16.540]   I had a friend of mine who was a client of mine,
[00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:17.740]   actually, back in the day.
[00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:20.020]   And, you know, he liked to go out
[00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:23.180]   and to pick things and buy things.
[00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:26.860]   And he had a barn that was just full of stuff
[00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:29.220]   that he'd found and bought and stored.
[00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:31.260]   And I remember I said to him at one point,
[00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:34.180]   "Do you ever sell any of this stuff?"
[00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:36.360]   And his reply was, "Theoretically."
[00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:40.580]   And I said, "What's going to happen when you die?"
[00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:42.220]   By the way, he has passed away since.
[00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:43.340]   "When you die," I said,
[00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:45.780]   "Well, you know, what's your wife going to do with this?
[00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:47.380]   What are your kids going to do with it?"
[00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:49.260]   He said, "Well, that's their problem."
[00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:50.860]   But it is a problem.
[00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:54.380]   I mean, so, yeah, I just, you know,
[00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:57.820]   I want my life as simple as unencumbered as possible.
[00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:00.140]   Now, having said all that, I mean,
[00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:04.020]   I know people who own lots of stuff,
[00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:05.460]   and as far as I can tell,
[00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:09.420]   are perfectly comfortable with that arrangement.
[00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:12.980]   You know, it doesn't seem to bother them at all.
[00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:16.000]   Maybe they, I don't know, I don't know how they do it.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.500]   It would drive me up the wall.
[00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:21.580]   But yeah, I think that, you know, when you own things,
[00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:23.700]   then they're part of your life,
[00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:26.340]   and they wind up owning you.
[00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:28.740]   - So I saw a cartoon recently,
[00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:33.460]   and it was a picture of an older gentleman
[00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:35.820]   standing in front of a storage unit,
[00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:37.420]   and the storage unit was open,
[00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:41.260]   and all of this junk was in the storage unit.
[00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:43.980]   You know, broken lamps and, you know, paper, books,
[00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:48.160]   all this stuff's flowing out of the storage unit,
[00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:50.300]   and it's clearly just junk.
[00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:53.480]   And he's talking to his son, and he says to his son,
[00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:57.180]   "Someday, son, this will all be yours."
[00:32:57.180 --> 00:33:00.220]   And this is the look on the son's face
[00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:02.020]   as he's looking at all this.
[00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:04.900]   - You can have all of this stuff when you're alive,
[00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:07.900]   but please get rid of it before you die,
[00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:10.540]   because it's gonna end up,
[00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:12.820]   you're just creating a real mess
[00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:14.860]   for whoever has to clean up your estate.
[00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:17.780]   - Yeah. - Very good.
[00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:19.740]   Anyway, all right, next thing.
[00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:21.980]   You put in here savings rate,
[00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:25.200]   and you talk a lot about savings rate in your book.
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:30.200]   And you wrote, "Try saving and investing 50% of your income
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:34.600]   with no debt.
[00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:36.180]   This is perfectly doable."
[00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:39.600]   And I'm assuming you meant 50% of your after-tax income.
[00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:42.520]   You put down, "The beauty of a high savings rate
[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:43.760]   is twofold.
[00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:48.240]   You learn to live on less, even as you have more to invest."
[00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:50.800]   Yeah, so comment on a high savings rate
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:53.500]   and the extra benefit of a high savings rate.
[00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:57.400]   - So, first of all, this is another thing
[00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:58.960]   that I get a lot of pushback on.
[00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:00.720]   I mean, I've had people say
[00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:02.920]   that I don't put any credence in this book,
[00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:04.160]   "The Simple Path to Wealth."
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:07.160]   You know, he lost me the moment he said, "Save 50%."
[00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:12.120]   Nobody can possibly save 50% of their income.
[00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:14.240]   So there is a contingent of people
[00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:15.880]   who come across that idea
[00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:20.020]   and just dismiss it out of hand as being impossible.
[00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:24.120]   By the same token, especially in the fire community,
[00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:27.000]   I have people routinely say to me,
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.040]   "50%? That's way too low.
[00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:33.280]   I saved 60, 70, 80%, you know?
[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:37.140]   I mean, you're setting your sights way too low, JL," you know?
[00:34:37.140 --> 00:34:38.000]   (laughing)
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   So it's certainly, 50% is absolutely doable.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.040]   I've done it.
[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:46.600]   There are lots of people who tell me
[00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:48.420]   that it's much too modest
[00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:50.080]   because they're doing something
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:54.740]   considerably larger percentage.
[00:34:54.740 --> 00:34:57.480]   It's just a matter of how you organize your life.
[00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:00.160]   And, you know, when I got out of college
[00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:03.520]   and I got my first professional job in the '70s,
[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:06.520]   I was making $10,000 a year.
[00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:07.440]   And I thought to myself,
[00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:08.880]   "You know, there are people out there
[00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:10.480]   living on $5,000 a year,
[00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:12.960]   and there's no reason I can't do that."
[00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:14.640]   And that's what I did.
[00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:18.120]   And I had a perfectly good life doing it,
[00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:20.220]   not as extravagant as some of my friends
[00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:22.120]   who were spending all their money.
[00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:25.980]   But it was, I had a great young adulthood,
[00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:29.540]   and then I invested the rest of it.
[00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:31.220]   And then as my income grew, you know,
[00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:32.740]   and I was making $20,000,
[00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:35.620]   now my lifestyle had also doubled
[00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:39.140]   because I'm spending 10 and my investments doubled.
[00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:43.980]   So I think 50% for me is the sweet spot.
[00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:46.660]   But, you know, again, I get it from both directions
[00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:49.740]   that, you know, nobody can do that at all,
[00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:52.760]   and nobody should only save 50%,
[00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:54.120]   they should be saving much more.
[00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:57.000]   So I'm caught in the middle.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:03.120]   - Okay, so I'm going to deviate a little bit from this list
[00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:07.720]   and talk about how much is enough.
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:10.200]   So you're saving 50%, it's accumulating,
[00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:12.880]   you're putting it in index funds, it's growing.
[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:15.800]   You know, you're reaching this FI,
[00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:17.600]   financial independence stage,
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:20.620]   but how much is that?
[00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:23.780]   - Well, that's a very individual thing.
[00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:26.180]   So as you mentioned, as you know,
[00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:29.040]   when you're talking about the savings rates,
[00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:32.260]   one of the beauties of having a high savings rate
[00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:34.620]   is you learn that you're living on less
[00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:37.380]   and you figure out, at least I did,
[00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:40.920]   that you can have a very enjoyable life.
[00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:43.140]   Let's say you're making $100,000 a year.
[00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:45.700]   So you're spending $50,000,
[00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:49.280]   you can have a very enjoyable life spending 50,000.
[00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:50.860]   I did back in those days.
[00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:56.100]   And that also means that 50,000 is now,
[00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:58.420]   if you want to continue having that same life,
[00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:01.700]   that's the amount of money you need in retirement.
[00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:03.820]   And it's a whole lot easier, of course,
[00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:06.660]   to have enough money to generate 50,000
[00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:08.260]   than it is 100,000.
[00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:11.280]   The basic formula is what's come to be known
[00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:13.500]   as the 4% rule, which says,
[00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:17.500]   if you have enough money that you can live on 4% of that
[00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:20.740]   drawn each year, then you are financially independent.
[00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:22.140]   So if you have a million dollars
[00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:25.460]   and you can live on 4%, which is 40,000,
[00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:27.680]   you have enough, you're financially independent.
[00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:30.700]   Or you turn the math around and you say,
[00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:33.900]   well, I'm living on 40,000, how much do I need?
[00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:37.060]   You multiply that by 25, you get a million.
[00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:37.940]   It's the same thing.
[00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:40.180]   So that's the basic formula.
[00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:44.020]   - Let me ask you about Social Security.
[00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:49.660]   I'm not taking it yet, but you are there
[00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:50.500]   and you're married,
[00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:52.940]   so your wife is getting Social Security also,
[00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:55.980]   either on her own or a spousal benefit.
[00:37:55.980 --> 00:38:00.980]   I believe Social Security is going to be around for us,
[00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:03.960]   who are Medicare age and older,
[00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:07.140]   but a lot of young people have a belief
[00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:08.900]   that it won't be there.
[00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:11.820]   It's going to be non-existent.
[00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:15.060]   Everything that we paid in is just going to be a tax
[00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:17.100]   or it's going to get cut so considerably
[00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:21.780]   that I can't even factor it into my retirement program.
[00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:24.060]   I think that's a little overstated.
[00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:26.800]   How do you feel about younger people saying
[00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:27.900]   it's not going to be there
[00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:30.580]   or it's not even going to be enough
[00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:32.780]   to make any difference in my retirement?
[00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:36.980]   - So I actually wrote a post about this a number of years ago
[00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:38.560]   and it's a chapter in the book.
[00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:43.060]   So my post had to be before 2016.
[00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:45.620]   And I would say the same thing today
[00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:47.580]   that I said in that post,
[00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:50.260]   which is when I was young,
[00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:53.240]   I also had no confidence that Social Security
[00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:54.260]   was going to be around.
[00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:58.600]   And I invested my money assuming that it wouldn't be.
[00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:02.780]   And if it was, that it'd just be kind of a nice benefit.
[00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:06.540]   Well, now I'm drawing Social Security, as is my wife.
[00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:09.380]   And so obviously it is around.
[00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:13.640]   And I'm surprised candidly at how generous it is.
[00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:15.700]   And you were never intended to live on Social Security
[00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:19.920]   by the way, but we have a pretty modest life.
[00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:21.300]   We do a lot of traveling.
[00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:26.300]   If you pulled that travel off and we have a paid for house,
[00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:29.020]   we'd probably live on Social Security without a problem.
[00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:31.180]   So I'm kind of stunned that it was,
[00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:35.540]   that how generous it is in my retirement.
[00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:37.580]   My advice to young people would be,
[00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:40.460]   and I guess I'm kind of conservative in some ways,
[00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:41.820]   would be to do what I did,
[00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:45.220]   which is to invest assuming
[00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:48.140]   that it's not going to be around.
[00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:52.340]   But my bet would be that it will be in some format
[00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:54.660]   because doing away with Social Security
[00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:57.180]   would be such a politically different thing,
[00:39:57.180 --> 00:40:01.420]   difficult thing to do because old people vote.
[00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:02.940]   - Oh yes, absolutely.
[00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:07.140]   - And politicians, the thing that politicians care about
[00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:11.100]   is they're keeping their position, their job.
[00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:11.920]   - It's staying a politician.
[00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:13.060]   - It's staying a politician.
[00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:16.980]   And, you know, 'cause those are pretty sweet gigs.
[00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:17.820]   - Yes.
[00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:20.340]   - And most politicians don't want to give them up.
[00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:23.500]   And, you know, if you start talking about doing away
[00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:26.540]   with Social Security or severely cutting it,
[00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:30.140]   even if that's the right fiscal thing to do for the country,
[00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:31.300]   you're going to lose your job.
[00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:32.140]   - Absolutely.
[00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:34.300]   - Or there's a high likelihood of it.
[00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:37.900]   So that means that my guess is somehow
[00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:43.740]   we're going to figure out how to keep Social Security going.
[00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:45.420]   But so my, you know, my advice is,
[00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:47.900]   hey, assume it's not going to be there.
[00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:50.540]   My guess is, like me, when the time comes,
[00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:52.740]   you'll be pleasantly surprised.
[00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:54.980]   - I agree with what you just said.
[00:40:54.980 --> 00:40:57.300]   And I believe that, number one,
[00:40:57.300 --> 00:41:00.280]   for at least for people who are, say, over the age of 50,
[00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:02.300]   Social Security is not going away.
[00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:03.620]   - Oh, absolutely, yeah.
[00:41:03.620 --> 00:41:06.020]   - It may change a little bit, but not much.
[00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:08.540]   There are just way too many people in this country
[00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:11.500]   who that's all they have is Social Security.
[00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:13.460]   So it's not going anywhere.
[00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:17.380]   But for younger people, if you want to calculate in
[00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:22.380]   a 20 or 25% reduction in what you would get today,
[00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:25.300]   I think that's reasonable.
[00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:26.980]   But I work with a lot of young people
[00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:28.900]   and they put down zero, you know, none.
[00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:29.720]   We're not going to get any.
[00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:32.220]   And I think that's, I think that is a little unrealistic.
[00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:33.380]   You are going to get something.
[00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:35.740]   It may not be exactly the generous benefits
[00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:36.980]   that are given today.
[00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:39.220]   And they are quite generous, as you said.
[00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:42.580]   Especially if you have a spouse who doesn't have
[00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:45.700]   a work history and can get a spousal benefit.
[00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:47.000]   It's kind of amazing.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.540]   You look at it, I get my regular Social Security
[00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:53.620]   and my spouse who isn't, didn't work enough quarters
[00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:57.020]   to get it herself, she's going to get 50%
[00:41:57.020 --> 00:42:01.600]   of my full retirement amount when she hits
[00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:02.440]   full retirement age.
[00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:04.800]   And I said, "Where does this money come from?"
[00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:05.640]   (laughs)
[00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:06.560]   She didn't put any money in.
[00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:08.540]   I didn't put any extra in.
[00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:09.380]   Where does it come from?
[00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:11.960]   And so it comes from other people.
[00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:14.760]   - If I can make one final comment.
[00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:18.840]   You know, my, and this is probably going to be germane
[00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:22.960]   to the sort of people who will be listening to this podcast.
[00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:25.960]   And it's, and I think it's a little bit of bad news.
[00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:30.960]   My best guess is the way they will solve Social Security
[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:36.260]   in the future is if you are wealthy,
[00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:39.780]   they will take it away from you.
[00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:42.740]   And so the kind of people who listen to a podcast
[00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:45.180]   like this and who read my book and what have you
[00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:48.680]   are probably going to wind up pretty wealthy
[00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:52.680]   when they retire because these approaches work.
[00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:55.920]   And already, if you look at what Social Security,
[00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:59.400]   what they do with Social Security, and I feel this myself,
[00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:02.600]   if you have been successful in your life,
[00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:04.640]   your Social Security is going to be taxed.
[00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:08.480]   So you're going to give back some of this money
[00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:11.160]   that was your money that was put in.
[00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:13.520]   They're going to take, they're going to confiscate from you
[00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:15.120]   in the form of taxes.
[00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:18.120]   Your Medicare payment will be adjusted
[00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:20.640]   depending on your income.
[00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:23.760]   If you make more money, if you have been successful
[00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:27.160]   and you go into your retirement prosperous,
[00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:29.360]   you are going to pay a whole lot more for your Medicare,
[00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:31.960]   which is taken right out of your Social Security
[00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:33.680]   than otherwise.
[00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:36.840]   And I expect that that's the trend that will continue.
[00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:40.880]   And it could be very likely that people like you and me
[00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:44.320]   30 years from now hitting their retirement
[00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:46.600]   might indeed have no Social Security
[00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:50.280]   because the law will be written in such a way
[00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:53.800]   that if you are too rich, quote unquote,
[00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:56.840]   then we're just going to keep your benefit
[00:43:56.840 --> 00:43:59.880]   and distribute it to somebody else.
[00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:03.160]   - Well, it already is a tax for many people who are,
[00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:08.160]   let's say, reached the point with the amount of money
[00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:09.600]   they paid into Social Security
[00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:11.360]   and the amount of years that they've paid in
[00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:12.760]   where they're maxed out.
[00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:15.240]   Because it doesn't matter how much you pay in,
[00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:18.000]   there's only a maximum amount that you can get out.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:22.520]   It's like $4,200 a month if you wait till age 70 now.
[00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:23.360]   - That's a good point.
[00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:25.440]   - So no matter how much you put in after that,
[00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:27.960]   it's not going to change how much you get out.
[00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:31.640]   And so it's just a tax after that.
[00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:32.640]   - Right.
[00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:37.640]   - So you're working on a new book, "Pathfinders."
[00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:41.320]   I have to tell you, you have some great titles for books.
[00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:43.880]   (laughing)
[00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:46.040]   "Pathfinders" is something I would just pick up
[00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:49.640]   and start reading because, gee, I want to find my path.
[00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:54.240]   It's like the book, "What Color is Your Parachute,"
[00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:56.160]   when you're looking for your career, right?
[00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:59.280]   It's like just the title attracts you to the book.
[00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:01.200]   And you read the book because the title is so good.
[00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:03.000]   I think "Pathfinders" is a great title.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:03.840]   So I wish you luck.
[00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:06.640]   But tell us what's in "Pathfinders."
[00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:09.520]   - So the subtitle of "Pathfinders"
[00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:10.760]   kind of answers that question.
[00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:13.480]   The subtitle being, "Extraordinary Stories
[00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:15.120]   "of People Like You on the Quest
[00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:17.280]   "for Financial Independence."
[00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:19.040]   Ever since I started writing the blog,
[00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:23.480]   but even more so once "The Simple Path to Wealth" came out,
[00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:27.160]   people have shared with me their stories
[00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:29.840]   about how they've adapted the principles
[00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:34.920]   to their own unique situations and lives.
[00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:37.720]   And I wrote this book, as we mentioned earlier
[00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:40.240]   in the conversation, for my daughter.
[00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:42.320]   Now, my daughter is an American,
[00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:43.760]   and she's at the beginning,
[00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:46.200]   or was at the beginning of her financial journey.
[00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:49.480]   And "The Simple Path to Wealth" kind of reflects that.
[00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:52.960]   But most people who read that book
[00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:55.600]   are not at the beginning of their journey.
[00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:57.960]   They're not in college or about to come out.
[00:45:57.960 --> 00:46:01.880]   Most of them are in their 20s, 30s, 40s.
[00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:06.600]   They've already followed other investment ideas and paths,
[00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:08.880]   or maybe they've gotten themselves into debt,
[00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:12.360]   or a lifestyle they need to unwind
[00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:17.000]   to pursue financial independence.
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:20.160]   Many of them, you know, I have an international readership.
[00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:22.280]   So I have a lot of readers
[00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:24.000]   who are not in the United States,
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:27.920]   and who have different investments available to them,
[00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:30.160]   and different kinds of investment vehicles.
[00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:31.800]   And I've always been fascinated
[00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:34.240]   at how all these diverse people
[00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:36.960]   with their unique situations
[00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:40.240]   have successfully taken the concepts in that book
[00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:42.240]   and made it work for them.
[00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:46.040]   And so this has been an idea
[00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:49.360]   that has kind of tickled around in the back of my mind
[00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:53.480]   ever since I came out with "The Simple Path to Wealth."
[00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:56.160]   And a year ago, a little better than a year ago,
[00:46:56.160 --> 00:47:00.360]   Harriman House, the publishers of Morgan Housel's book,
[00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:03.800]   "The Psychology of Money," a great book, by the way.
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:07.480]   And they were the publishers of that.
[00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:10.320]   And they reached out to me about doing something,
[00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:13.360]   and we started kicking around an idea
[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:17.600]   that was not quite as fleshed out as what I just described.
[00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:20.120]   It took us some time to get there.
[00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:22.480]   But then they were very helpful in that process.
[00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:27.480]   And so anyway, last year, we came to terms.
[00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:31.920]   And in the spring, I sent out a request
[00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:35.080]   on the blog to my readers and said,
[00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:37.840]   "Hey, we're putting this book together.
[00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:40.400]   "And if you have a story you want to share."
[00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:42.360]   And we got a huge response.
[00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:43.200]   - I saw that.
[00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:45.240]   I saw that post that you made
[00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:47.800]   asking for people to contact you, yeah.
[00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:50.080]   - Yeah, and we got a wonderful response
[00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:51.960]   and some incredible stories,
[00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:55.880]   which we've then edited.
[00:47:55.880 --> 00:47:59.360]   And I think we've done a really good job
[00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:01.200]   of keeping their voice.
[00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:05.040]   Well, editing it for space and content, what have you.
[00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:08.320]   And so it's a collection of just
[00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:10.880]   under a hundred of those stories.
[00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:12.640]   Interestingly, and I'm gonna be putting up
[00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:16.640]   a couple of blog posts come January, samples of these.
[00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:19.840]   We have a story from a guy in Ukraine
[00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:22.840]   that's about how do you stay the course
[00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:24.280]   on the simple path to wealth
[00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:28.160]   when your country's at war and it's been invaded.
[00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:33.040]   And we also have a story from a guy in Russia
[00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:35.760]   who's like, "How do you stay on the simple path to wealth
[00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:39.320]   "and stay the course when your country's become a pariah
[00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:42.240]   "in the international community?"
[00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:44.680]   I'm gonna publish those two stories separately
[00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:49.160]   as blog posts, 'cause they're ripped out of the news,
[00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:51.360]   right, it's just incredible.
[00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:56.040]   And so, yeah, that's what Pathfinders is all about.
[00:48:56.040 --> 00:48:59.440]   Pre-orders are gonna be available in the very near future
[00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:01.120]   and I'll be announcing that.
[00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:02.960]   And then the book itself will come out
[00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:05.960]   in October of this coming year.
[00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:07.320]   Well, that's great.
[00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:10.560]   The book that I've been working on for a long time
[00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:12.240]   is called "A Few Good Funds,"
[00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:14.080]   "The Majesty of Simple Investing."
[00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:19.080]   And I break down the way in which you get
[00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:23.800]   to a simple portfolio, 'cause as having the philosophy,
[00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:25.600]   which is what you write about in your book,
[00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:27.520]   you know, low-fee indexing, so forth,
[00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:30.880]   as having that low-fee philosophy.
[00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:33.880]   But the second part of that is strategy.
[00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:37.520]   And what strategy is is using the philosophy,
[00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:39.440]   as you wrote in your book,
[00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:41.960]   how do you apply it to your situations,
[00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:45.160]   which sounds exactly about what this book is about.
[00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:49.840]   How do you create a strategy based on where you are
[00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:51.680]   and what you have available to you,
[00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:54.520]   say, the person in Russia, the person in Ukraine.
[00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:56.640]   They have very different things available to them
[00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:59.640]   than what we have available to us here in the United States.
[00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:01.880]   So how do you take the philosophy
[00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:03.600]   and apply it to your situation?
[00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:05.200]   And that is your strategy.
[00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:07.240]   And then the third thing is discipline,
[00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:08.360]   which is to stay the course.
[00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:10.680]   So those three things, have the philosophy,
[00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:13.240]   come up with the strategy, and then stay the course.
[00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:16.200]   It's really gonna be interesting to read that book
[00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:19.840]   because it's all about how each one of us
[00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:23.120]   has to come up with our own way or our own path
[00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:26.000]   to get to where we need to go,
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:28.000]   but at least you have a north star, you know,
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:31.440]   a guiding light to follow this direction.
[00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:33.560]   - The other thing that I find inspirational
[00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:36.160]   about reading these stories is,
[00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:37.880]   and we've talked about this a little bit earlier
[00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:39.160]   in our conversation, you know,
[00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:42.360]   people who say it's just not possible.
[00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:44.440]   You know, normal people can't do this.
[00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:48.320]   And, you know, and then you read these stories
[00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:52.720]   and you realize that it absolutely can be done.
[00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:57.720]   And no, you don't have to be a tech engineer to do it.
[00:50:57.720 --> 00:51:00.160]   People from very modest circumstances,
[00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:04.880]   from very difficult circumstances are able to do this.
[00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:08.520]   And so it just really drives home the point
[00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:12.440]   that there's no excuse other than you don't,
[00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:13.640]   you choose not to do it.
[00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:14.480]   And that's fine.
[00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:18.520]   I mean, if you choose not to, you know,
[00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:21.240]   to move towards financial independence,
[00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:22.640]   it's your life, it's your money,
[00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:25.440]   and that's, I have no problem with that choice.
[00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:28.560]   If you tell me it's not possible to do it,
[00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:30.160]   I have a problem with that assertion
[00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:32.680]   because it's absolutely possible.
[00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:37.440]   And I can guarantee that anybody who says it's not possible,
[00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:41.520]   there's somebody who has a much more difficult road than you
[00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:43.720]   who is currently doing it or has done it.
[00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:46.040]   - So one last question,
[00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:50.240]   and this has to do with passing it on.
[00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:54.240]   You know, we at the Bogle has a very big on education.
[00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:57.600]   That's a nonprofit organization.
[00:51:57.600 --> 00:52:01.560]   We are trying to educate people.
[00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:02.960]   And a lot of times,
[00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:06.960]   parents are trying to educate their children
[00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:10.720]   or aunts and uncles are trying to educate
[00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:12.280]   their nieces and nephews,
[00:52:12.280 --> 00:52:16.600]   and they're trying to introduce them to this idea.
[00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:19.440]   And it's difficult, right?
[00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:23.440]   Because they don't want to listen to you
[00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:25.440]   or they have other things on their mind,
[00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:28.280]   or maybe, you know, they just bought Bitcoin
[00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:30.880]   and it went up 5% in one day and they sold it
[00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:33.280]   and this is how you make money or what.
[00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:36.960]   So as the reason, the whole purpose
[00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:41.720]   for your existence on the internet and with the books
[00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:44.880]   is to educate your daughter who did not want to listen,
[00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:47.160]   you know, after a while, heard too much of it.
[00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:49.640]   Could you pass on some advice to the parents
[00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:51.440]   and the aunts and the uncles who are trying to help
[00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:54.640]   their younger generation understand this?
[00:52:54.640 --> 00:53:00.520]   - Oh, you know, I don't feel like I'm qualified to do that
[00:53:00.520 --> 00:53:05.360]   because the whole reason that the blog and the books exist
[00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:09.280]   is because I did such a poor job of that myself.
[00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:11.600]   No, my daughter, my daughter likes to tease me now.
[00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:13.040]   She says, you know, dad,
[00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:15.320]   if I had listened to you when I was young,
[00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:17.840]   there'd be no blog, there'd be no books.
[00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:20.400]   He's absolutely right.
[00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:24.720]   If I had been more skilled at delivering the message to her
[00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:27.440]   when she was young so she could listen to it
[00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:29.240]   without being turned off,
[00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:31.640]   then you and I wouldn't be having this conversation.
[00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:33.800]   I would not have started the blog,
[00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:35.120]   I wouldn't have started the books.
[00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:38.960]   So I guess my only advice would be don't do what I did,
[00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:42.280]   which was to push it too hard, too fast.
[00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:43.120]   - Yes.
[00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:44.840]   - One of the things that's very gratifying to me
[00:53:44.840 --> 00:53:47.400]   and is parents will tell me all the time
[00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:50.320]   that they are gifting "The Simple Path to Wealth"
[00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:51.560]   to their kids.
[00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:54.360]   And obviously I'm gratified by that.
[00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:55.680]   I don't know, candidly,
[00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:57.920]   how many of those kids wind up reading it.
[00:53:57.920 --> 00:53:59.320]   What's even more gratifying
[00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:03.320]   is when I hear from young people themselves
[00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:05.960]   who say that they have read the book
[00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:09.000]   and that it resonates with them.
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:10.280]   And, you know, you and I talked about
[00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:12.960]   how long it took us to come to indexing.
[00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:16.280]   Well, I'm hearing from people in their late teens and 20s
[00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:20.000]   who have read my work and the work of other people
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:24.160]   who are investing in their index funds now.
[00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:25.000]   - Yes.
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:25.840]   - At that age.
[00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:29.480]   And I think to myself of all the decades I wasted,
[00:54:29.480 --> 00:54:31.280]   sounds like the decades you wasted,
[00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:35.320]   sounds like probably a lot of people listening to this,
[00:54:35.320 --> 00:54:38.640]   the huge advantage that it's going to be
[00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:42.240]   to these people coming out in their late teens or 20s
[00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:43.720]   who embrace this stuff early
[00:54:43.720 --> 00:54:45.760]   and don't wander through the wilderness
[00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:47.480]   making the mistakes that I made.
[00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:51.640]   So that's what's really gratifying when I hear that.
