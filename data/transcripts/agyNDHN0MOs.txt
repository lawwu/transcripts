[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - What are some common mistakes people are making
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.960]   when they try to find information online?
[00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.400]   - I think most people get wrong
[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.520]   is that they operate the same way online
[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.040]   as they do in person.
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.920]   Instead of thinking that your idea is the best,
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.520]   why aren't you in a subreddit
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.120]   seeing what the most upvoted posts are
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.760]   over the last month, the last year, et cetera, all time?
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.560]   A lot of people don't use any data.
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.840]   And if they do, they also tend to use survey data,
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.760]   which is skewed for many reasons.
[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:28.920]   People are familiar with that.
[00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.680]   There's a whole lot more search data,
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:31.880]   which I think is much better,
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.840]   both in terms of scale and the fact
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.080]   that people are actually searching it on their own terms,
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.400]   not being asked a question.
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.920]   And then there's a third bucket, which is sales data,
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.240]   which is, you could actually argue even better
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.280]   because people aren't just searching for something
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.400]   or curious about it,
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.400]   but they're actually putting their money
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.560]   where their ideas are.
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.800]   And so that's kind of like the very baseline thing
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.000]   that I think people get wrong.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.880]   Simple as it sounds,
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.040]   they're just not using the data that's accessible to them.
