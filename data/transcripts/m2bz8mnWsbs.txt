[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Well, what is grace?
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   It seems like such a simple question, but the answer has a lot of different angles to it.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   It is a recent email from a podcast listener named Heather.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   "Hello Pastor John, I'm shy to ask this question because I'm embarrassed to admit
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   that I struggle to understand one of the most commonly used words in the church today.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   That word is grace.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   I often hear it defined as unmerited favor or getting what you don't deserve,
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   and I do understand it this way in the context of Ephesians 2.8.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   But I don't understand it in the context of texts like 2 Corinthians 12.9.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   My grace is sufficient for you, for my strength is made perfect in weakness.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   Or in 1 Corinthians 15.10.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace towards me was not in vain.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   On the contrary, I worked harder than any of them,
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   though it was not I, but the grace of God that is within me."
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   I don't understand grace in these two verses.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   Can you explain it to me?
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   Well, one of the reasons I love this question, and I know I say that a lot.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   Yeah, we get some good questions.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   Exactly, I love what we do here.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   I love all these questions, but actually some of them are too hard to love.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   But this one is a softball to me.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   Because those verses that she is troubled by are some of my favorites.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   But here's one of the reasons I love this question,
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   and it's because it gives me a chance to say to Heather and to everybody,
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   "You know, we're all really in this together,
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   and I don't have any special advantage over you in answering these questions,
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   except maybe that I've had a little more practice."
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   In other words, what I do when I hear a question like this
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   is something Heather could do or anybody could do.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   I open my Bible, and I get out my concordance,
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   and I look up all the words for grace.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   I mean, all the words "grace" in the Bible.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   There's 131 of them, 131 uses of "grace" in the ESV English translation.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   And 124 of those are in the New Testament,
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   and 86 of them are in the Apostle Paul,
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   which means two-thirds of all the uses of the word "grace" in the Bible
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   are in one author.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Paul. No wonder he's called the Apostle of Grace.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   So I say that to encourage Heather,
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   not that she shouldn't have written in, I'm glad to have the question,
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   but rather to encourage her and everyone that there's nothing magical
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   about to hold an office in the church, like pastor,
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   or nothing magical to have a degree in scholarship in the academy.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   We all go about answering questions pretty much the same way.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Look at all the Bible has to say,
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   and then do your best to see how it all fits together,
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   all the while being humble and submitting your mind
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   to what the Bible teaches.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   So you are always bracketing your preconceptions
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   and trying to build your conceptions out of all the pieces of the Bible.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   It's like a puzzle that you're trying to put the picture together,
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   put all the pieces, and you know because it's God's Word,
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   these pieces are going to fit.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   If they don't fit in this life, they're going to fit in the next,
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   but we work on it as much as we can.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   So to answer her question, let's just limit ourselves to Paul,
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   that she quoted, and to the two kinds of grace use that she saw.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   On the one hand, grace is called,
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   and I think it's an absolutely wonderful word or phrase,
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   undeserved favor.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   We are justified, this is Romans 3:24,
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   we are justified by His grace as a gift through the redemption
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   that is in Christ Jesus.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   So grace is what inclines God to give gifts that are free
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   and undeserved by sinners.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Or Romans 5:15, "If many died through one man's trespass,
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   much more have the grace of God and the free gift by grace
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   of that one man, Jesus Christ, abounded for many."
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   So grace is that quality in God that produces free gifts
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   for guilty sinners in salvation.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   Or Romans 11:5, "At the present time,
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   there is a remnant chosen by grace,
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   but if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works,
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   otherwise grace would no longer be grace."
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   That's Romans 11, 5 and 6.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   So you can't work to earn grace, it is free and undeserved.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   Now that's what most of us have in our minds when we say
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   God is a God of grace.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   And that's true, it's wonderful.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   Our eternal lives depend on it.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   None of us would be saved if grace were not undeserved favor
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   and were not a quality in the mind of God,
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   in the heart of God, in the nature of God.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   But then Heather rightly notices another group of passages,
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   these also in Paul, where he comes at grace a little differently.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   He says in 2 Corinthians 9, 8, "God is able to make all grace
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   abound to you so that having all sufficiency in all things
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   at all times, you may abound in every good work."
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   That seems to picture grace as a power or an influence for obedience.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Here it is again in 2 Corinthians 12, 9.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   Jesus says to Paul, "My grace is sufficient for you.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   My power is made perfect in weakness."
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   Or again in verse 10 of 1 Corinthians 15, "By grace I am what I am,
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   and His grace toward me was not in vain.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   On the contrary, I worked." That was the effect of grace.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   "I worked harder than any of them, though it was not I,
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   but the grace of God that was with me."
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   So in all three of those texts, and they're not the only ones,
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   grace is not only a disposition or quality or inclination
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   in the nature of God, but is an influence or a force
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   or a power or an acting of God that works in us
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   to change our capacities for work and suffering and obedience.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   So what I do when I see things like this in the Bible
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   is to adjust my categories in my head.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   And I don't say, "Oh, that can't be because I've got this category in my head."
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   No, no, no. You fix the categories in your head.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   If once I only thought of grace as a character trait
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   or a disposition or an inclination in the nature of God,
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   which moved Him to treat sinners better than they deserve,
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   if that was my only conception once upon a time,
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   now, having seen all the texts, I broaden my understanding of grace
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   as the Bible uses the term.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   And now I say, "Well, it appears that the word 'grace' in Paul's use
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   not only refers to God's character trait or disposition or inclination
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   to treat people better than we deserve,
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   but the word 'grace' also refers to the action or the power
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   or the influence or the force of this disposition,
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   which produces real practical outcomes in people's lives,
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   like being sufficient for good deeds or enduring a thorn in the flesh
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   or working harder than everybody else, Paul says about his own apostolic work.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   Now, that does not mean you have to give up that simple definition
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   of undeserved favor. That's true. That's a good definition.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   It just means that the word also embraces the encouraging truth,
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   at least I love the truth. That's why these verses are so precious to me.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   The encouraging truth that this favor overflows in powerful,
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   practical helpfulness from God in your daily life where you most need it.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   That help is also called grace because it's free and it's undeserved.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   So let me end with a precious verse that we all know and love
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   and maybe have never thought about it in this term of grace.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   Hebrews 4.16, "Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace."
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   So that's a throne with the quality and the character and the inclination
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   to treat people better than they deserve. That's the kind of throne we're coming to.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   But then it says, "That we may receive mercy and find grace to help,
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   grace to help in time of need," or more literal translation,
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   "find mercy and grace for a well-timed help."
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   It is incredibly encouraging that God's grace is both the inclination of the divine heart
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   to treat us better than we deserve and is the extension of that inclination in practical help.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   Wonderful. Thank you for the survey of grace in the Bible.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   And thank you for the wonderful question, Heather.
