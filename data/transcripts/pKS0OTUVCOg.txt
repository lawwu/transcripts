[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.680]   Pastor John, it seems you have traditionally placed the emphasis on
[00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.600]   Bible memorization for the personal benefits derived from the discipline. Is
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:17.880]   there a community dimension to Scripture memory as well? Tony, usually when I
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.120]   try to defend memorizing Scripture, I'll go right to the soul work that it does
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:27.800]   in my heart. I love to memorize Scripture because something happens to my soul. I
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.600]   feel like I know God better. I have a more intimate relationship with Him. His
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.680]   fellowship is more steadfast as I take it with me through the day, but that
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.880]   that's not what I want to say this time in answering this question because
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.480]   something that happened last night, just to remind me of something that's happened
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:50.040]   many times, I want to encourage people to memorize Scripture, say two or three
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.880]   verses or a chapter, some precious unit, and then be on the lookout for what I
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:03.640]   would call immeasurable moments. Moments where the insertion of that text from
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.080]   your heart, eyeball to eyeball, without having to open a book and read it, coming
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:16.400]   from your soul, would make that moment explode with significance. So for example,
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:22.400]   we had over last night a missionary family who's going to be leaving
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.760]   actually tomorrow to go back to Southeast Asia, and we just wanted to
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:33.680]   one, save them having to make a meal, and the other is just to bless
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.440]   them as they go. And as we stood in the kitchen before we got our taco salad, we
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.360]   held hands, and they thought I was just gonna pray, and I said, "Let me give you a
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:49.880]   word from the Lord that I think is for you." And then I recited Psalm 121. I lift
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.360]   up my eyes to the hills, from where does my help come? My help comes from the Lord
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.040]   who made heaven and earth. He who keeps you will not slumber. He who keeps Israel will
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.600]   not slumber or sleep. The Lord is your keeper. The Lord is your shade upon your
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.800]   right hand. He won't let your foot be moved. He's your helper. He's your keeper.
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:13.120]   He will keep your going out, and he will keep your coming in from this time,
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.920]   forth, and forever. I got it right last night. But you can see the relevance of
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:23.320]   that. For you're going out, and you're coming in. He's gonna keep you. And they
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:28.000]   were looking right at me, I think, with some surprise as I gave it to them. And
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.040]   my prayer is now, with that immeasurable moment, they'll look back and
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:39.000]   remember, Pastor John didn't just pray with us before the meal. He sent us off
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.880]   by reminding us God's gonna keep us on the airplane, keep us in the airport, keep
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.440]   us on the ground in Southeast Asia. He's gonna keep us when we go. He's gonna keep
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:54.320]   us when we come. And so my plea for folks is that they would take a few
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:03:07.360]   Psalms, Psalm 46, Psalm 16, Psalm 130, Psalm 121. For me, Psalm 130, "If you, O Lord,
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.160]   should mark iniquities, who could stand? Could not." How many times have I knelt
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.800]   down, put my arm on somebody who's just been broken for some sin that they've
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.840]   committed, and I've been able to just pray, "Lord, if you would mark
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.000]   iniquities, who could stand?" So I'm not elevating myself above this person. With
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.240]   the very Word of God, there's forgiveness with you that you may be feared. And how
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.760]   many times when I've been asked to pray in public, in some setting, my
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.720]   default prayer, "Whom have I in heaven but you? And on earth there's nothing that I
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:48.960]   desire besides you." So my point is this. There are situations in life that just
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:55.320]   cry out for a word from God from your soul. Not just, "Let me get my Bible out
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.400]   and read you a text," but rather give it from the soul. And I would just encourage
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:04.840]   folks, if they would memorize a half a dozen special passages of Scripture
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:10.560]   that fit a bunch of situations, and then look for those immeasurable moments, they
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.560]   would become an emissary of grace beyond all their expectations.
