[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   And how similar or different are the brain areas
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.800]   controlling speech and language in say a songbird
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.800]   and a young human child?
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.440]   - Yeah, so going back to the 1950s
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.800]   or even a little earlier and Peter Mahler and others
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.840]   who got involved in neuroethology,
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.160]   the study of neurobiology of behavior in a natural way,
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.160]   right, you know, they start to find that behaviorally,
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.960]   there are these species of birds like songbirds and parrots
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.440]   and now we also know hummingbirds, just three of them
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.080]   out of the 40 something bird groups
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.360]   out there on the planet, orders,
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.040]   that they can imitate sounds like we do.
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.720]   And so that was a similarity.
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.560]   In other words, they had this kind of behavior
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.660]   that's more similar to us than chimpanzees have with us
[00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.060]   or than chickens have with them, right,
[00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.560]   their closer relatives.
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.040]   And then they discovered even more similarities,
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.540]   these critical periods that if you remove a child,
[00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.720]   you know, this unfortunately happens where a child is feral
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.080]   and is not raised with human
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.360]   and goes through their puberty phase of growth,
[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.600]   becomes hard for them to learn a language as an adult.
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.400]   So there's this critical period where you learn best.
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.760]   And even later on when you're in regular society,
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.900]   it's hard to learn.
[00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.760]   Well, the birds undergo the same thing.
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.360]   And then it was discovered that if they become deaf,
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.880]   we humans become deaf, our speech starts to deteriorate
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.420]   without any kind of therapy.
[00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.600]   If a non-human primate or, you know,
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.900]   or let's say a chicken becomes deaf,
[00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.800]   their vocalizations don't deteriorate,
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.800]   very little, at least.
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.280]   Well, this happens in the vocal learning birds.
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.200]   So there were all these behavioral parallels
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.920]   that came along with the package.
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.320]   And then people looked into the brain,
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.920]   Fernando Nadava, my former PhD advisor,
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.720]   and began to discover the area X you talked about,
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.280]   the robust nucleus of the archipelagium.
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.360]   And these brain pathways were not found
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.720]   in the species who couldn't imitate.
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.520]   So there was a parallel here.
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.800]   And then jumping many years later, you know,
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.760]   I started to dig down into these brain circuits
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:12.160]   to discover that these brain circuits
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.160]   have parallel functions with the brain circuits for humans,
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.600]   even though they're by a different name,
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.280]   like Broca's and laryngeal motor cortex.
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.340]   And most recently we discovered not only
[00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.880]   the actual circuitry and the connectivity are similar,
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.560]   but the underlying genes that are expressed
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.200]   in these brain regions in a specialized way,
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.800]   different from the rest of the brain are also similar
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.200]   between humans and songbirds and parrots.
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.520]   So all the way down to the genes,
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.640]   and now we're finding the specific mutations
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.240]   are also similar, not always identical, but similar,
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.400]   which indicates remarkable convergence
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.760]   for a so-called complex behavior
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.920]   in species separated by 300 million years
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.240]   from a common ancestor.
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.780]   And not only that, we are discovering
[00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.720]   that mutations in these genes
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.520]   that cause speech deficits in humans, like in FOXP2,
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.280]   if you put those same mutations or similar type of deficits
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.120]   in these vocal learning birds, you get similar deficits.
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.160]   So convergence of the behavior is associated
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.000]   with similar genetic disorders of the behavior.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.280]   - Incredible.
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.400]   I have to ask, do hummingbirds sing or do they hum?
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.320]   - Hummingbirds hum with their wings
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.160]   and sing with their syrinx.
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.540]   - In a coordinated way?
[00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.980]   - In a coordinated way.
[00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.820]   There's some species of hummingbirds
[00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.580]   that actually will,
[00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.860]   Doug Oshawa showed this,
[00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.420]   that will flap their wings
[00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.400]   and create a slapping sound with their wings
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.700]   that's in unison with their song.
[00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.620]   And you would not know it,
[00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.960]   but it sounds like a particular syllable in their songs,
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.740]   even though it's their wings
[00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:50.500]   and their voice at the same time.
[00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.900]   - Hummingbirds are clapping to their song.
[00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.660]   - Clapping, they're snapping their wings together
[00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.260]   in unison with the song to make it like,
[00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.100]   if I'm going,
[00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.460]   ♪ Ba-da-da-da-da, ba-da ♪
[00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.160]   You know, and I banged on the table.
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.500]   Except they make it almost sound like their voice
[00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:07.440]   with their wings.
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.420]   - Incredible.
[00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:10.260]   - Yes.
[00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.080]   - I'm-
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.920]   - And they got some of the smallest brains around.
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.740]   - I guess as a kid, you would say mind blown.
[00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:14.580]   - Yes, yes.
[00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:15.400]   - Incredible.
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.240]   - Yes.
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.100]   - Incredible, I love hummingbirds.
[00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.500]   And I always feel like it's such a special thing
[00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.820]   to get a moment to see one because they move around so fast
[00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.500]   and they flit away so fast in these ballistic trajectories
[00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.100]   that when you get to see one stationary for a moment,
[00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.220]   or even just hovering there,
[00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:32.780]   you feel like you're extracting so much
[00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.540]   from their little microcosm of life.
[00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.100]   But now I realize they're playing music, essentially.
[00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.940]   - Right, exactly.
[00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.420]   And what's amazing about hummingbirds,
[00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.740]   and we're gonna say vocal learning species in general,
[00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.620]   is that for whatever reason,
[00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.260]   they seem to evolve multiple complex traits.
[00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.260]   You know, this idea that evolving language,
[00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.240]   spoken language in particular,
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.140]   comes along with a set of specializations.
[00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:59.700]   - Incredible.
[00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.020]   When I was coming up in neuroscience,
[00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.960]   I learned that, I think it was the work of Peter Marler,
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.660]   that young birds learn, songbirds,
[00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.660]   learn their tutor's song and learn it quite well,
[00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.900]   but that they could learn the song of another tutor.
[00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.580]   In other words, they could learn a different,
[00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.260]   and for the listeners, I'm doing air quotes here,
[00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.020]   a different language, a different bird song,
[00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:25.980]   different than their own species song,
[00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.060]   but never as well as they could learn
[00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.860]   their own natural genetically linked song.
[00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:33.680]   - Yes.
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.540]   - Genetically linked, meaning that it would be like
[00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.260]   me being raised in a different culture,
[00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:41.300]   and that I would learn the other language,
[00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.140]   but not as well as I would have learned English.
[00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:45.140]   This is the idea.
[00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:45.980]   - Yes.
[00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:46.800]   - Is that true?
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:47.640]   - That is true, yes.
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.540]   And that's what I learned growing up as well,
[00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.880]   and talked to Peter Marler himself about before he passed.
[00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.880]   Yeah, he used to call it the innate predisposition to learn.
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:02.240]   All right, so, which would be kind of the equivalent
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.780]   in the linguistic community of universal grammar.
[00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:09.580]   There is something genetically influencing
[00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.860]   our vocal communication on top of what we learn culturally.
[00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.980]   And so there's this balance between
[00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:19.780]   the genetic control of speech, or a song in these birds,
[00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.860]   and the learned cultural control.
[00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:25.620]   And so, yes, if you were to take,
[00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:29.980]   I mean, in this case, we actually tried this
[00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:33.100]   at Rockefeller later on, take a zebra finch
[00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.640]   and raise it with a canary, it would sing a song
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:38.260]   that was sort of like a hybrid in between,
[00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.240]   we call it a caninch, right?
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.820]   (laughing)
[00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:43.640]   And vice versa for the canary,
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:44.700]   because there's something different
[00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:48.940]   about their vocal musculature or the circuitry in the brain.
[00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:52.140]   And with a zebra finch, even with a closely related species,
[00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:55.700]   if you would take a zebra finch, a young animal,
[00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:57.220]   and in one cage next to it,
[00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:00.500]   place its own species, adult male, right?
[00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.860]   And in the other cage, place a Bengalis finch next to it,
[00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:06.060]   it would preferably learn the song
[00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:08.780]   from its own species neighbor.
[00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:10.540]   But if you remove its neighbor,
[00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:13.300]   it would learn that Bengalis finch very well.
[00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:14.780]   - Fantastic. - So there's,
[00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:17.380]   it has something to do with also the social bonding
[00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:18.740]   with your own species.
[00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:19.960]   - Incredible.
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:21.820]   That raises a question that I,
[00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:23.220]   based on something I also heard,
[00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:25.620]   but I don't have any scientific,
[00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:27.340]   peer-reviewed publication to point to,
[00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:29.860]   which is this idea of pigeon, not the bird,
[00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:34.140]   but this idea of when multiple cultures and languages
[00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:36.040]   converge in a given geographic area,
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.780]   that the children of all the different native languages
[00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:41.580]   will come up with their own language.
[00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.380]   I think this was in island culture,
[00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.020]   maybe in Hawaii, called Pidgin,
[00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:47.940]   which is sort of a hybrid of the various languages
[00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:49.740]   that their parents speak at home,
[00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:51.740]   and that they themselves speak,
[00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:54.980]   and that somehow Pidgin, again, not the bird,
[00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:57.780]   but a language called Pidgin for reasons I don't know,
[00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:03.020]   harbors certain basic elements of all language.
[00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:04.180]   Is that true?
[00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:05.060]   Is that not true?
[00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:07.780]   - I haven't studied enough myself
[00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:09.900]   in terms of Pidgin specifically,
[00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:12.540]   but in terms of cultural evolution of language
[00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:15.940]   and hybridization between different cultures and so forth,
[00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:18.940]   even amongst birds with different dialects,
[00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:20.460]   and you bring them together,
[00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:26.340]   what is going on here is cultural evolution
[00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:29.540]   remarkably tracks genetic evolution.
[00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:31.620]   So if you bring people
[00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:33.460]   from two separate populations together
[00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:35.740]   that have been in their separate populations,
[00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:39.740]   evolutionarily at least, for hundreds of generations,
[00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:42.940]   so someone speaking Chinese, someone speaking English,
[00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:46.620]   and that child then is learning from both of them,
[00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:49.060]   yes, that child's gonna be able to pick up
[00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:54.060]   and merge phonemes and words together
[00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:56.940]   in a way that an adult wouldn't,
[00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:00.100]   because why they're experiencing both languages
[00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:04.420]   at the same time during their critical period years
[00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:08.060]   in a way that adults would not be able to experience.
[00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:09.940]   And so you get a hybrid.
[00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:11.980]   And the lowest common denominator
[00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:13.740]   is gonna be what they share.
[00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:16.180]   And so the phonemes that they've retained
[00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:18.900]   in each of their languages
[00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:21.660]   is what's gonna be, I imagine, used the most.
[00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:24.780]   (upbeat music)
[00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:27.360]   (upbeat music)
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.540]   (upbeat music)
