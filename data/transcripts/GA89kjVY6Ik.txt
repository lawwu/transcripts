[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.720]   where we discuss science
[00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.920]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.120]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.160]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.280]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.140]   Recently, the Huberman Lab Podcast hosted a live event
[00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.320]   at the Sydney Opera House in Australia.
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.480]   The event was called the Brain-Body Contract
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.680]   and featured a lecture,
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.480]   followed by a question and answer session with the audience.
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.360]   We wanted to make the question and answer session
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.440]   available to everyone, regardless if you could attend.
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.900]   So what follows is the question and answer session
[00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.240]   from the Sydney Opera House in Australia.
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.680]   I also would like to thank the sponsors for the event.
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.920]   They are 8Sleep and AG1.
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.640]   8Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.080]   with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.300]   And one of the key aspects to getting a great night's sleep
[00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.960]   is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment.
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.440]   And that's because in order to fall
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.840]   and stay deeply asleep,
[00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.620]   your body temperature actually has to drop
[00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.240]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.220]   And in order to wake up in the morning feeling refreshed,
[00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.360]   your body temperature actually has to increase
[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.960]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.320]   8Sleep makes it extremely easy to control the temperature
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.880]   of your sleeping environment at the beginning, middle,
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:07.720]   and throughout the night,
[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.280]   and when you wake up in the morning.
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.120]   I've been sleeping on an 8Sleep mattress cover
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.640]   for nearly three years now,
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.000]   and it has dramatically improved my sleep.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.240]   If you'd like to try 8Sleep,
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.360]   you can go to 8sleep.com/huberman
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.440]   to save $150 off their Pod 3 cover.
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.360]   8Sleep currently ships to the USA, Canada, UK,
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.700]   select countries in the EU, and Australia.
[00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.720]   Again, that's 8sleep.com/huberman.
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.200]   The other live event sponsor, AG1,
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.240]   is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.880]   that also contains adaptogens
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.860]   and other critical micronutrients.
[00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.720]   I've been taking AG1 daily since 2012,
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.640]   so I'm delighted that they decided to sponsor the live event.
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.920]   The reason I started taking it,
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.680]   and the reason I still take it every day,
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.680]   once or twice a day,
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.040]   is that it ensures that I meet all of my quotas
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.840]   for vitamins and minerals,
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.680]   and it ensures that I get enough prebiotic and probiotic
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.760]   to support gut health.
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.460]   Now, of course, I strive to consume healthy whole foods
[00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.880]   for the majority of my nutritional intake every single day,
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.840]   but there are a number of things in AG1,
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.520]   including specific micronutrients
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.080]   that are hard to get from whole foods,
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.960]   or at least in sufficient quantities.
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.400]   So AG1 allows me to get the vitamins and minerals
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.160]   that I need, probiotics, prebiotics, the adaptogens,
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.180]   and critical micronutrients.
[00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.080]   To try AG1, go to drinkag1.com/huberman,
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.220]   and you'll get a year's supply of vitamin D3K2
[00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.320]   and five free travel packs of AG1.
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.120]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman.
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.400]   Thank you to the Sydney Opera House for hosting us
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.320]   and for making this event possible.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.900]   [upbeat music]
[00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:53.320]   What are the latest findings on the physiological mechanisms
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.760]   behind stress's impact on the body and brain,
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.540]   and what are some practical tools or techniques
[00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:59.700]   for managing stress effectively?
[00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.320]   Well, thank you for that question.
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.300]   I'll deliberately not repeat what I said earlier
[00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.760]   about physiological size, panoramic vision, et cetera,
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.120]   and raising stress threshold,
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.520]   because we covered that already.
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.660]   But I think that one of the most interesting findings,
[00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.520]   two most interesting findings in the field of stress
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.560]   in the last five years, or even three years,
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.000]   I think the work from my colleague, Allie Crum at Stanford,
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.040]   she's been a guest on the podcast, she works on mindsets,
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.280]   is the following result.
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.960]   Students, Stanford students, that is,
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.640]   come into the laboratory, they view a,
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.240]   I think it's a five-minute movie
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.840]   about how awful stress is for the mind and body,
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.760]   all the things it does, like deplete your immune system,
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.880]   make you miserable, deplete certain aspects
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.420]   of the reproductive axis, and on and on,
[00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.320]   and then a separate group comes in
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.940]   and watches a video, also five minutes, also true,
[00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.540]   about all the things that stress can do
[00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.600]   to enhance performance, both cognitive or physical,
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.600]   like additional energy, additional cognitive power,
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.920]   access to certain memory sets,
[00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.080]   albeit narrow memory sets, et cetera,
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.040]   and what you find is that the results
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.680]   point directly to the fact
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.200]   that whatever you believe about stress,
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.120]   provided the information you have is true,
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.400]   is what happens.
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.400]   So if I tell you that stress improves
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.000]   your memory-focused attention, one observes that.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.440]   If I tell you that stress depletes
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.200]   your immune system, et cetera, one observes that.
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.800]   So this is something that we don't quite yet understand
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.560]   as neuroscientists, and the psychology of it
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.000]   makes more sense, frankly, than the mechanisms,
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.920]   but it's becoming very clear that what we believe
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.120]   about a given phenomenon strongly impacts
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.360]   how it shapes our response to that.
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.020]   So I find that very interesting.
[00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.640]   Now, of course, you can't delete information
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.320]   about stress being bad for you,
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.560]   so what does that mean if you want stress
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.400]   to be enhancing, as it's called?
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.560]   There's literally now called
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.480]   the stress is enhancing mindset.
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.840]   The thing you can do is to learn more
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.160]   about how stress can be enhancing.
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.480]   We're not talking about lying,
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.520]   we're not talking about placebo effect,
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.240]   we're talking about real knowledge
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.960]   based in fact that one can absorb,
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.560]   and I find it amazing and wonderful
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.960]   that the mere learning of something
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.120]   can actually change how we respond
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.960]   to something at a core physiological level.
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.280]   The second, I think, very important set of findings
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.760]   on stress relate to a structure
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.720]   that I've talked about recently on the podcast,
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.080]   and I talked about with the one and only David Goggins.
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.280]   Most people presumably have heard,
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.440]   like, he's on his way, he's running here right now
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.780]   from Central America.
[00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.800]   Yeah, that guy, I'll tell you,
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:48.480]   that guy is every bit as intense as he comes across.
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.160]   I met him for the first time in 2016
[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.520]   at a gathering, it was in Silicon Valley,
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.400]   we're just doing a little bit of work for this company.
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.320]   At the end of the day, he leaves Terminate
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.720]   and he changes into his shorts and his shirt.
[00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.360]   He's like, I'm going running, I gotta go to the airport.
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.720]   I'm thinking, I'm gonna go running,
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:08.800]   then I'm gonna go to the airport.
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.040]   He was running to the airport.
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:15.320]   Seriously, only like 14 miles from the airport,
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.640]   which I realize 14 miles for a marathon are no big deal,
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.840]   but he's got his bags, and I'm thinking to myself,
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.080]   this guy, he's nuts, and I love him.
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.080]   I mean, he's really that guy.
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.300]   It's actually very refreshing.
[00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.960]   I think one reason we love the Rick Rubens
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:36.600]   and the David Goggins is they truly are different,
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.520]   but from one basic standpoint,
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.560]   is they just don't give a shit.
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.280]   They just do what they're gonna do,
[00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.380]   and they trust that they're doing right for them
[00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:47.000]   and for the people around them, and it's awesome.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:47.880]   It's really awesome.
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:52.680]   I think that it, again, brings about that word
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.500]   that doesn't come about very often for me,
[00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.760]   but it just kind of stuns you into like,
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:01.480]   behold, David Goggins, Rick Ruben,
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.760]   the cuttlefish, whatever, you know?
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.280]   (audience laughing)
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.940]   But I talked about this with David.
[00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:10.240]   There's this structure in our brain,
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.520]   and these are recent discoveries, not by my lab.
[00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:13.440]   I wish I had discovered these,
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.440]   but actually a colleague of mine at Stanford, Joe Parvizzi,
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.440]   who's in the Department of Neurosurgery,
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.360]   has made these beautiful discoveries
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.360]   about the anterior mid-cingulate cortex.
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.640]   The anterior mid-cingulate cortex
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:27.600]   is a structure in the brain that has a lot of subdivisions,
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:31.200]   but when Joe put a little stimulating electrode
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.240]   into this area, because he had patients
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:35.720]   that needed neurosurgery, and they probe around,
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:36.860]   asking questions, what do you feel?
[00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:37.700]   How do you feel?
[00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:38.520]   What are you gonna do?
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:39.360]   And sometimes they hit an area.
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:40.180]   I've seen these experiments.
[00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:41.280]   They're unbelievable.
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:44.500]   Stimulated an area, and the person says,
[00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:46.760]   you know, I feel like I'm about to go into a rage.
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:48.320]   And you're like, okay, let's back off.
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:49.320]   Let's move over here.
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:51.840]   Anterior mid-cingulate cortex is stimulate,
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:54.240]   and the patient, the person says,
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:57.520]   I feel like I'm heading into a storm.
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.920]   You go, oh, that doesn't sound good.
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.720]   And they say, nope, but I'm ready.
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.200]   I'm leaning in.
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:04.760]   A different patient, you stimulate their
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:06.960]   anterior mid-cingulate cortex, and the person says,
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.040]   I feel like I'm gonna get up out of my chair
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.400]   and do something really, really difficult.
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:12.560]   Okay, so this is interesting.
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:15.460]   Across multiple people, you're seeing the same general
[00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:19.260]   kind of forward center of mass kind of response,
[00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.940]   kind of leaning into challenge, and challenge specifically.
[00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:23.980]   And then there's now scores of studies
[00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:26.300]   in just the last three to five years
[00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:28.580]   showing that, for instance, people who successfully
[00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:30.900]   overcome a challenge of any kind,
[00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:33.300]   fitness challenge, cognitive challenge,
[00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:35.340]   anterior mid-cingulate cortex expands,
[00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:37.860]   or at least increases its baseline levels of activity.
[00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:39.780]   You see people that fail to meet that challenge,
[00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:41.820]   less anterior mid-cingulate cortex activity.
[00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:43.780]   So there's a bidirectionality of the response.
[00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:47.140]   And on and on, and it seems that doing things
[00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:49.580]   that are difficult, that we don't enjoy,
[00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:51.580]   or that we have to push ourselves to do,
[00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:55.460]   grow and enhance the activity within
[00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:56.900]   this anterior mid-cingulate cortex.
[00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:59.840]   And the beauty of it is that it generalizes,
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:03.360]   that the anterior mid-cingulate cortex can be applied,
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.680]   or the growth of it can be directed
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.920]   towards lots of different things,
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:11.220]   which is, I think, a call for, of course,
[00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:14.700]   seeking pleasure, seeking comfort, seeking relaxation,
[00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:16.580]   seeking sleep every night, seeking sunlight
[00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:17.980]   in the morning, et cetera.
[00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:21.220]   But also, deliberately seeking out challenges,
[00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:23.020]   that is, challenges for us.
[00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:26.300]   The importance of doing hard things in a safe manner,
[00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:29.460]   psychologically and physically safe manner, of course,
[00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:32.020]   is truly beneficial toward our ability
[00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:34.740]   to manage ourselves in what would
[00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:36.340]   otherwise be called stress.
[00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:38.860]   So I think those, the work of Ali Crum
[00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:40.940]   and the work on the anterior mid-cingulate cortex
[00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:42.980]   by Parvizzi and a bunch of other labs,
[00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:46.340]   I think are the two areas where I feel like
[00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:47.940]   things are happening really quickly,
[00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:50.020]   we're making big strides as a field,
[00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:54.260]   and we're moving away from kind of conjecture
[00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:59.260]   about how to better ourselves in lots of different ways.
[00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.700]   Can you talk about time perception?
[00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:06.440]   Why is it that in some instances time moves very slowly,
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.780]   while in others it seems to move very fast?
[00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:10.260]   Thank you, tonight has been so fun.
[00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.360]   Thank you, I've had fun too.
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:16.940]   This is something I'm trying to do more of,
[00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:18.500]   not necessarily live, so that too,
[00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:23.500]   but someone recently, who I love and admire very much,
[00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:27.020]   said to me, "We're gonna have so much fun."
[00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:32.020]   And I thought, whoa, behold, no one's ever said that to me.
[00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:34.020]   No one's ever said that to me.
[00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:36.740]   All my years growing up, I mean, I love,
[00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:38.100]   with all due respect to my parents,
[00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:40.220]   I can't remember anyone ever turning to me and saying,
[00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:42.220]   "We're gonna have so much fun."
[00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:45.780]   So I'm trying, that to me just kind of blew me away.
[00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:48.340]   I'm thinking, yeah, like, you're allowed to have fun.
[00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:52.460]   So time perception is a topic that I am, you know,
[00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:55.040]   as obsessed by as I am many other topics,
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:58.460]   but one that is really near and dear to my heart
[00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:03.460]   because I've always been struck by this observation
[00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:06.920]   that is certainly not uniquely mine,
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:10.160]   that, you know, if you're sitting waiting
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.200]   for an appointment at the doctor's office,
[00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:15.560]   it feels like time goes by really slowly,
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:16.980]   like really slowly.
[00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:21.620]   Whereas if you have a really full day
[00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:23.880]   with lots and lots of activities,
[00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:27.080]   it seems like time went by really fast.
[00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:28.280]   Like, oh my God, I can't believe it.
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:29.900]   So much time has gone by.
[00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:33.200]   Sorry, so much has happened, excuse me,
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.400]   but not a lot of time has gone by,
[00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:38.760]   which means that our frame rate on life is highly dynamic.
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:39.880]   And in fact, it is.
[00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:42.620]   And in fact, it's set by, you guessed it,
[00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:44.980]   our visual system, at least for sighted folks,
[00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:46.940]   for people who are low vision or no vision.
[00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:49.000]   And by the way, I always reference that
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.520]   because my laboratory has worked on low vision,
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:53.380]   no vision issues for a number of years.
[00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.960]   It's through the auditory system.
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:12:00.240]   But for sake of generalizing now and for simplicity,
[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.360]   we'll talk about the visual system.
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:06.360]   So it is a fact that when we focus on things up close,
[00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:10.200]   think a watchmaker, think about looking into your phone,
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:12.960]   our perception of time is more fine-grained.
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:15.680]   That is, our frame rate is higher.
[00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:17.820]   Okay, so more frames per second
[00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:20.000]   than when we view things at a distance.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.320]   You might think, well, how could that possibly be?
[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:23.620]   How could that possibly be?
[00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:24.720]   But it makes perfect sense.
[00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:25.800]   You know, when we think about
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:29.340]   the time-space coding in the brain,
[00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:31.220]   we need to anchor ourselves to something,
[00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:33.480]   the rising and setting of the sun, of course the,
[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:35.280]   you know, I mean, unless you're a flat earther,
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:37.080]   you know, we're going around the sun.
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:39.320]   No, what's that?
[00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:41.120]   No, someone, we got no flat earthers?
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:42.840]   One flat earther in the audience.
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:43.720]   Okay, cool.
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:47.480]   I don't think that's what they were saying,
[00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:52.200]   but we need to anchor ourselves in time,
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.600]   and our visual system is the way
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:54.960]   that we anchor ourselves in time.
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:57.660]   We have facts about past, present, and future,
[00:12:57.660 --> 00:12:59.200]   so we have knowledge.
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:02.220]   But at an unconscious level,
[00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:06.320]   we need to anchor our frame rate, set our frame rate.
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.840]   And so this is why, if you go down to Bondi,
[00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:11.500]   and you lie back, and you look up at the clouds,
[00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:14.280]   and the clouds are kind of moving in an unpredictable way,
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:15.880]   whenever we're looking at a landscape
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:20.120]   which has some lack of predictable features,
[00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:23.160]   like waves, or rustling of trees,
[00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:25.720]   where you could predict that if the wind's blowing this way,
[00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:28.400]   that the tree's gonna go this way, and then back again,
[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.280]   but you're not really in a mode
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:31.880]   of trying to anticipate just how far,
[00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:32.920]   in the same way that, for instance,
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:35.480]   if you call an Uber, or you're waiting on a text message,
[00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:36.960]   you know, if you're ever waiting on a text message,
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.200]   you notice you'll fine slice.
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:39.880]   Okay, dot, dot, dot, when's that thing coming,
[00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:41.840]   when's that thing, you're fine slicing time.
[00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:44.280]   As your level of autonomic arousal goes up,
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:49.200]   your frame rate goes up.
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:52.120]   As your level of autonomic arousal goes down,
[00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:55.200]   so you're sleepy, or if you're viewing things
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:59.240]   that have kind of an unpredictable aspect to them,
[00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:04.240]   then your frame rate expands, the passage of time changes,
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.480]   or your perception of the passage of time changes.
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:10.280]   This is why, one of the reasons why I love aquaria.
[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:12.240]   You know, and one of my favorite things to do,
[00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:14.460]   since I don't have a fish tank at home right now,
[00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:19.160]   but that's gonna change soon, is I'll go on YouTube,
[00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:21.640]   and there's this beautiful live video
[00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:26.640]   of this aquarium in Japan, and I'll just zone out.
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:28.240]   It's like the most relaxing thing ever,
[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:30.800]   and every once in a while, a whale shark,
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:32.600]   they have a whale shark in an aquarium.
[00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:34.480]   Every once in a while, a whale shark will go through,
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:37.920]   and you go like, whoa, and then it disappears,
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:39.480]   and then the little fish, and the kelp,
[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.160]   and it's immensely relaxing.
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:45.440]   What it does is it slows your frame rate down,
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:47.280]   and then I find that resets me
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:48.840]   after just five or six minutes to go back
[00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:51.000]   to doing this high frame rate type stuff,
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.420]   which is what we're doing when we're texting,
[00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:54.280]   when we're typing, when we're social media.
[00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:56.260]   It, by the way, is tuned to a frame rate
[00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:59.040]   that's really interesting that keeps us engaged
[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:00.880]   just up into the point where then we wanna swipe
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:02.000]   to the next thing.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.600]   The algorithms are designed, and by the way,
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:08.400]   I have a somewhat benevolent, semi-benevolent view
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:09.240]   of social media.
[00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:10.060]   I think it'd be used for good.
[00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:12.520]   I think it'd be used for not good.
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:15.500]   I think limiting one's time on there is good,
[00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:17.760]   but there's some good content on there for sure.
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:20.400]   A lot of my life is spent on there indeed.
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:23.080]   So frame rate is set by where you're looking.
[00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:24.960]   The further out you're looking,
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:29.560]   the larger, the longer sort of time bins you're capturing,
[00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:32.160]   bigger time bins, okay, less resolution.
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:34.880]   Closer in, and the more you're trying to predict
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:37.680]   the next outcome, sort of fine-grained analysis,
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:40.440]   predicting what we call DPOs, duration, path, and outcome,
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.440]   what's gonna happen for how long,
[00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:44.760]   and what's gonna happen is something
[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:46.880]   that you're thinking about and wondering about.
[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:48.840]   Then frame rate goes up.
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:52.320]   And there's actually a wonderful movie, a Hitchcock movie,
[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:54.040]   the name escapes me at the moment,
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:56.880]   in which Hitchcock understood this.
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:59.560]   And it's a movie that's only about 90 minutes long,
[00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:02.680]   but in the background, the sun rises and sets,
[00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:05.520]   and the way that people move through the scenes
[00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:08.200]   of this movie gives you the feeling by the end
[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:12.720]   of this 90-minute movie that a full 24 hours passed.
[00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:14.180]   It's really interesting.
[00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:17.660]   You feel it in your body as if it was a much longer movie,
[00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:19.760]   even though if you look at your watch, that happens.
[00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:21.800]   And now the cannabis smokers, again, are thinking,
[00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:23.000]   like, yeah, like where you sit there,
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.520]   and you're like, whoa, that was a really long time
[00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:27.720]   you looked at, and it's like three minutes went by,
[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.880]   and you're like, whoa, like, wow.
[00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:32.540]   Psychedelics will do this as well.
[00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:34.420]   They certainly do, they distort our time perception,
[00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:37.160]   mainly through the deployment of large amounts
[00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:38.800]   of the neuromodulator serotonin,
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:41.080]   which is intimately involved in our kind
[00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:42.720]   of clock perception mechanisms.
[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:44.680]   There are a bunch of other things that can set
[00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:48.660]   sort of intrinsic rhythmicity of our auditory system
[00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:50.180]   that also adjust our frame rate.
[00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:52.380]   I think one of the reasons why 40 hertz tones
[00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:54.180]   can be valuable for doing cognitive work
[00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:57.860]   is that they tend to entrain certain circuits
[00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:00.020]   within the brain for doing the kinds of work
[00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:02.060]   that most people call work, okay,
[00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:03.860]   where you have to type things out, think logically,
[00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:07.100]   kind of if-then kind of analysis.
[00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:10.540]   Very different than, say, writing new sheet music
[00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:12.740]   or coming up with poetry where, you know,
[00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:15.280]   here again, we can think back to the, you know,
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:16.680]   the Rick Rubin thing or the, you know,
[00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:18.040]   being stationary, right, you know,
[00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:19.680]   like the wall or sitting with a movement
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:20.960]   in the brain going forward.
[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:23.120]   There's something about adjusting frame rate
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:27.720]   for capturing new ideas versus implementing ideas.
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.960]   Implementation of ideas tends to be carried out
[00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:33.200]   on higher frame rate type time perception,
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:36.560]   and now you can understand why our visual perception
[00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:38.360]   set about the distance of a laptop or phone
[00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:41.480]   would be good for that or a conversation.
[00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:42.680]   You know, remember that whole thing of, like,
[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:44.940]   looking at somebody's face and having a conversation
[00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:46.820]   as opposed to looking off into the distance,
[00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:49.580]   walking, and allowing one's gaze to go panoramic.
[00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:51.980]   So, hopefully, now you're starting to sense some themes.
[00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:54.020]   So, that's all I'll say about time perception now,
[00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:56.900]   but, of course, humans have throughout history
[00:17:56.900 --> 00:18:00.180]   and still now, frankly, also embarked
[00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:02.180]   on a lot of pharmacology, if we're honest,
[00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:03.780]   in order to try and adjust frame rate
[00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:05.860]   for sake of productivity, but, you know,
[00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:07.780]   caffeine will adjust frame rate
[00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:09.920]   in the predictable direction,
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:12.580]   but also things like alcohol and various drugs
[00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:15.660]   like, you know, cannabis in order to adjust frame rate.
[00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:17.380]   I'm certainly not suggesting you do those things.
[00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:18.940]   I'm not a cop, you do what you want,
[00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:20.700]   just know what you're doing.
[00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:22.700]   Can you please talk about the jet lag protocol
[00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:24.900]   you followed when arriving in Sydney?
[00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:28.940]   Oh, yeah, well, this one was a little bit easier for me
[00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:32.500]   because, obviously, it's not that far off,
[00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:35.020]   it's just you're a full day ahead
[00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:38.420]   from where I live back home in California,
[00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:41.420]   but, nonetheless, I suffer tremendously from jet lag
[00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:44.180]   and once, actually, in 2017, I went to Abu Dhabi,
[00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:48.700]   it's a 12-hour flip from where I was living
[00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:51.180]   at that time in the Bay Area, and I was a wreck.
[00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:53.620]   I could barely make it to the meeting, I was crying,
[00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:55.580]   I was, it really messes me up.
[00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:57.340]   I slept great the first night
[00:18:57.340 --> 00:19:00.340]   and then just didn't sleep for two days, I was a mess.
[00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:04.060]   So, jet lag is something that I really had to work hard on
[00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:06.580]   and there are a couple things worth noting.
[00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:08.000]   I mean, we've done a whole episode about this,
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.020]   so I'll kind of hit a few key bullet points
[00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:12.940]   and maybe it's relevant to you
[00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:15.420]   even if you're not traveling at any point soon
[00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:17.500]   because many people are jet lagged without traveling
[00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:19.500]   because of the way that they stay up late.
[00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:21.660]   In fact, most everybody in the world now
[00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:24.140]   qualifies as a shift worker, did you know that?
[00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:26.740]   And here, no disrespect, only reverence and gratitude
[00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:28.600]   to the actual shift workers that stay up all night
[00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:30.740]   doing emergency work and hospital work
[00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:32.580]   and caring for children and things like that
[00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:33.420]   throughout the night.
[00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:34.940]   So, I'm not trying to take anything away from them,
[00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:37.140]   but we are all shifted enough by virtue
[00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:41.960]   of artificial lighting and electronic devices
[00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:46.960]   that we are effectively shifted and shift working
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:49.520]   because we're staying up, engaging our cognitive systems
[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:51.240]   in ways that, frankly, we didn't evolve to,
[00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:53.520]   which I'm not saying is bad, but it's just the reality.
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:56.440]   Okay, what to do for jet lag.
[00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:58.440]   The key thing is this, and actually,
[00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:00.640]   this is very valuable in general for sake of sleep.
[00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:03.080]   So, this is something I haven't talked enough about
[00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:07.880]   on the podcast, ask yourself what time you normally wake up
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:09.360]   without an alarm.
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:12.640]   I realize there's some variance day to day,
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:16.920]   but for me, it would be about, let's say 6 a.m.
[00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:18.320]   So, let's say for you, it's seven.
[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:21.200]   Just pick your typical wake up time.
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:26.060]   If you subtract from that number, so for me, 4 a.m.,
[00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:29.920]   that almost with certainty is what's called
[00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:31.200]   your temperature minimum.
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:34.320]   Your temperature minimum, we could measure it.
[00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:36.320]   You could put a thermometer in your mouth,
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:37.760]   or if you come to the laboratory, unfortunately,
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:39.360]   they have to do it rectally.
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:42.720]   4 a.m. would be my temperature minimum.
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.800]   Maybe for you, if you wake up at seven,
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:48.800]   typically, or around seven, it's gonna be 5 a.m., okay?
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:50.920]   So, we're not actually measuring your temperature
[00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:53.200]   in this kind of gedanken, this thought experiment.
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:55.020]   What we're doing is we're trying to find a time.
[00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:57.560]   So, here's what's interesting.
[00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:01.200]   If you expose your eyes, not your skin,
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:06.200]   but your eyes to bright light in the two hours or so,
[00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:11.600]   maybe three hours prior to that temperature minimum time,
[00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:12.600]   so if you wake up at 7 a.m.,
[00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:14.420]   5 a.m. is your temperature minimum.
[00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:17.320]   So, in the two hours, maybe three hours prior to that,
[00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:20.740]   you're going to shift your wake up time
[00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:24.440]   and your to bed time, what's called a phase delay,
[00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:28.720]   a shift in your circadian rhythm, by about an hour.
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:31.840]   Interesting.
[00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:34.960]   Given that, if you view bright light
[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:38.860]   in the two to three hours after your temperature minimum,
[00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:43.300]   you advance your clock, meaning you pull back your clock
[00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:45.960]   to wanna wake up a bit earlier
[00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:50.080]   and go to sleep a little bit earlier, by about an hour,
[00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:52.120]   for every time you do that.
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:54.400]   You think, well, okay, I wake up in the morning
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:56.760]   at seven, let's say I'm using you as an example,
[00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:00.280]   or me at six, and I usually try and get some sunlight
[00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:02.600]   in my eyes, especially on overcast days, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:04.160]   You've heard me blab about this many times before
[00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:05.600]   on the podcast and elsewhere.
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:09.480]   So, how come I'm not going to bed earlier and earlier
[00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:13.160]   every night and waking up earlier and earlier every morning?
[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:15.360]   And indeed, you would.
[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:18.800]   You would keep phase advancing your clock if you did that,
[00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:20.400]   except that in the afternoon,
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:21.840]   if you got sunlight in your eyes,
[00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:22.800]   as presumably you did today,
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:25.120]   this beautiful sunny day on your way here,
[00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:28.080]   you phase delayed your clock a little bit,
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:30.280]   and as a consequence, you wake up and go to sleep
[00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:32.840]   at more or less the same time every day.
[00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:35.000]   It's an amazing mechanism, and guess what?
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.880]   Viewing sunlight in the middle of the day
[00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:38.200]   does not do the same thing.
[00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:39.700]   It doesn't shift your circadian clock.
[00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:42.320]   They don't tell you that in school, but they should.
[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:44.860]   They're telling you all the other stuff.
[00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:49.160]   The reason it doesn't do it is that middle of the day period
[00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:51.080]   is what's called the circadian dead zone.
[00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:53.760]   Sounds very dramatic, very ominous.
[00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:54.920]   Getting sunlight in your eyes
[00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:56.920]   during the middle of the day is great for mood.
[00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:58.800]   It's evident that it's also important
[00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:02.200]   if it gets on your skin in healthy, not burning amounts,
[00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:04.880]   levels that would induce burn,
[00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:07.720]   then it can enhance testosterone, estrogen levels, et cetera,
[00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:09.960]   in healthy ways, healthy ratios.
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:13.020]   Nonetheless, that morning sunlight viewing
[00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:15.560]   after your temperature minimum advances your clock,
[00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:18.320]   makes you want to get up earlier, go to bed earlier.
[00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:21.840]   Viewed before delays your clock,
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:23.780]   makes you want to get up later, go to bed later.
[00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:27.280]   So this is very useful if you ever want to shift your clock
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:29.920]   at home before you travel to get onto a new schedule
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:32.520]   for work or school, or if you're traveling.
[00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:35.640]   What it means is that when you arrive in a new location,
[00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:39.800]   like I did in Melbourne the other day,
[00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:43.020]   believe me, I practiced that for like at least an hour,
[00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:45.000]   and with two Aussies,
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.400]   and they kept telling me I was doing it wrong
[00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:48.480]   until finally they're like, "No, I'm just joking with you.
[00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:50.640]   "You got it right like the fourth time."
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:53.040]   You guys have a wicked sense of humor down here.
[00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:57.200]   The, once again, I'm tougher than I look.
[00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:02.200]   The key thing is that if you land,
[00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:06.760]   you have to ask, let's say at 8 a.m. local,
[00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:10.400]   or noon local time, the key is to ask yourself,
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:13.200]   hmm, what does my body think,
[00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:18.520]   what is my temperature minimum from back home?
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:22.480]   So for instance, if you land at 5 p.m.,
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:26.880]   but it corresponds to time before your temperature minimum,
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:28.240]   and you go outside, and you're like,
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:30.320]   whoa, beautiful setting sun,
[00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:32.840]   I'm supposed to get sunlight in my eyes.
[00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:33.680]   Well, guess what?
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:34.660]   You might delay your clock.
[00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:35.720]   If you want to go to bed earlier,
[00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:37.200]   that's probably not a good idea.
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:41.040]   Whereas if you want to advance your clock,
[00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:42.880]   you would view sunlight at a time
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:45.160]   that is corresponding to the two hours
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:46.400]   after your temperature minimum.
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:47.960]   I realize it's a little bit tricky,
[00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:49.280]   but that's all you have to ask yourself
[00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:51.320]   for the first three days,
[00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:54.040]   first three days that you travel to some location,
[00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:55.660]   because then you can shift very fast.
[00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:57.280]   So what that requires is sometimes saying,
[00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:59.000]   oh, I don't want to shift myself,
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   so I'm actually going to wear sunglasses and a brimmed hat
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.540]   to avoid shifting,
[00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:04.040]   because I'd like to be on the local schedule.
[00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:05.320]   Or in some cases, you think,
[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:07.160]   oh, I really want to wake up here,
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:09.440]   and I'm in the perfect opportunity to wake up,
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:11.880]   because it's the middle of the afternoon in Sydney,
[00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:16.480]   and back home, I would have just hit my temperature minimum,
[00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:18.400]   and so I'm going to get sunlight in my eyes.
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:20.120]   Well, that's going to wake me up,
[00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:21.760]   and it's going to actually make me want to go to bed
[00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:23.640]   a little bit earlier so I can go to bed at local time,
[00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:25.880]   so I'm not going to be up until, you know, 3 a.m.
[00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:28.120]   So you might have to work this out a little bit on paper,
[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:30.760]   but this is the way that military,
[00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:32.560]   and this is the way that shift workers
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:35.680]   who are educated in the mechanisms of this stuff,
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:36.680]   that's the way they do it.
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:38.480]   It also helps to eat on the local schedule,
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:41.360]   because food is another what we call zeitgeber,
[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:43.960]   another one of the timekeepers for the circadian clock,
[00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:46.000]   so if you force yourself to eat on the local schedule,
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.160]   that can help you shift.
[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:49.360]   Activity can help you shift,
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:51.840]   and social rhythms can help you shift as well.
[00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:54.760]   But that temperature minimum and the role of light
[00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:56.600]   before or after the temperature minimum,
[00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:59.760]   either delaying or advancing your clock,
[00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:04.080]   that's the heavy hammer in this whole process.
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:05.800]   So I did that, and these days,
[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:08.760]   I do a lot of red light time in the evening
[00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:09.680]   when I want to go to sleep,
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:12.480]   and I don't mean red light panels,
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:14.120]   like the expensive stuff.
[00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:15.600]   That has a whole other set of uses.
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:17.040]   What I'm talking about is just getting a red light,
[00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:18.080]   like a party light.
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:20.680]   We turn off the lights and put in a red light,
[00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:22.840]   and that is known to reduce cortisol levels
[00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:24.840]   as opposed to other kinds of lighting.
[00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:26.480]   So it only takes about half hour
[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:27.920]   before you go to sleep or so.
[00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:28.920]   You want to just mellow out.
[00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:30.600]   You just switch over to red light.
[00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:32.920]   It's actually very pleasant, right?
[00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:34.280]   As long as you can go about the activities
[00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:35.640]   you want to do safely,
[00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:38.440]   you just put a red light up.
[00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:39.560]   And by the way, Rick's house
[00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:40.920]   is like all red lights at night.
[00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:43.280]   No artificial lighting past sundown.
[00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:44.720]   It's like a plant.
[00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:45.920]   Can you elaborate on the science
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:49.320]   between psychedelic psilocybin and neuroplasticity?
[00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:50.160]   Yes.
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:53.040]   This is a topic that just a few years ago
[00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:55.720]   I was too frightened to talk about.
[00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:57.580]   I was afraid to lose my job, frankly.
[00:26:57.580 --> 00:27:02.360]   These are still scheduled drugs in the United States,
[00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:06.860]   although they are being explored for therapeutic reasons,
[00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:09.760]   mainly for the treatment of severe depression,
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:11.600]   but among other things,
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:13.520]   smoking cessation, eating disorders.
[00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:17.920]   By the way, anorexia nervosa still is the highest morbidity
[00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:19.880]   of any psychiatric challenge.
[00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:20.960]   It's just really tragic.
[00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:24.440]   So there's a real need for treatments that work.
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:29.440]   And psychedelics like psilocybin, LSD to some extent,
[00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:33.700]   MDMA, which technically is not a psychedelic,
[00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:34.880]   it's an empathogen,
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:37.740]   but we can talk about that, also called ecstasy.
[00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:41.560]   So these sorts of compounds have been explored
[00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:43.060]   quite extensively in the last few years.
[00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:45.860]   And I've completely revamped my stance on them
[00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:47.300]   for a couple of reasons.
[00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:48.620]   I'll just come clean.
[00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:52.860]   As a kid, too young, I explored these things.
[00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:54.560]   I do not recommend that.
[00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:57.140]   I had some pretty bad experiences on LSD
[00:27:57.140 --> 00:28:01.340]   as a young teenager, and I don't recommend it.
[00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:03.600]   I think the brain is highly plastic that time.
[00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:06.220]   In fact, being an adolescent, a kid or a teen
[00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:08.740]   is a psychedelic experience.
[00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:12.060]   You do not need psychedelics, and I don't recommend them
[00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:15.500]   unless some very qualified clinician
[00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:17.380]   can convince you otherwise.
[00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:20.420]   There, I would also seek a second opinion.
[00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:22.340]   But they clearly have their role.
[00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:25.840]   And I think a couple of things have changed my stance.
[00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:28.620]   First of all, there are a lot of federally funded studies
[00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:32.060]   taking place at Stanford and elsewhere on these compounds.
[00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:35.360]   Second, for whatever reason, and I don't quite understand
[00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:38.080]   the sociology of it, but for whatever reason,
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:42.280]   psychedelics are no longer associated
[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:46.100]   with the kind of counterculture the way they used to be,
[00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:48.560]   and are, in fact, heavily associated
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:49.800]   with some of the veterans groups
[00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:52.240]   that are using these for PTSD with groups in the States,
[00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:53.460]   groups like Veterans Solutions,
[00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:56.280]   which are doing amazing work with different psychedelics,
[00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:59.240]   including Ibogaine, Eboga,
[00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:01.980]   which is a 22-hour-long psychedelic journey.
[00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:05.340]   I've never done it, truly, where you close your eyes
[00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:09.900]   and you get essentially real-life-like recollection
[00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:11.740]   of your experiences, but you have agency
[00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:13.380]   inside these experiences.
[00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:15.460]   There's some cardiac issues with Ibogaine
[00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:17.500]   that require constant monitoring of the heart,
[00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:19.940]   but they've got some really impressive outcomes.
[00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:21.100]   This is all work by my colleague,
[00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:22.360]   Nolan Williams at Stanford.
[00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:24.740]   So things like psilocybin,
[00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:26.720]   we view a little bit differently nowadays.
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:28.220]   What is psilocybin?
[00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:32.360]   Psilocybin, if you look at it chemically,
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:37.020]   looks a lot like serotonin, a lot like serotonin,
[00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:41.700]   and it tickles, that is, it binds nearly selectively
[00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:43.540]   to a specific serotonin receptor,
[00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:45.360]   and it seems to create more
[00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:47.540]   what we call resting-state lateral connectivity,
[00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:50.220]   which means more brain areas connected to other brain areas
[00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:52.540]   or at least talking to those brain areas
[00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:55.540]   after the psilocybin journey, as it's called,
[00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:57.340]   as opposed to before.
[00:29:57.340 --> 00:30:02.200]   Now, these journeys, and I have done them as an adult,
[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:03.960]   I did this as part of a clinical trial,
[00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:06.320]   I participated in a psilocybin trial,
[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:08.620]   and I participated in an MDMA trial.
[00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:13.600]   They can be terrifying while they're happening,
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:16.880]   but often there's great insight from those experiences,
[00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:18.880]   provided the right support is provided,
[00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:21.160]   and they always say set and setting.
[00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:22.880]   So I'm not providing all these caveats
[00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:26.000]   about safety for no reason or to protect me.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:26.960]   I'm saying to protect you.
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:30.840]   I mean, it can be, and it was for me, absolutely terrifying,
[00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:33.200]   and then you do it again as part of these trials.
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:34.280]   The second time, I'm like, okay,
[00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:35.360]   this time when it's gonna be good,
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:37.720]   it gone, boom, terrifying.
[00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:40.240]   It was horrible, but I learned a lot,
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:42.640]   and there does seem to be an antidepressant effect.
[00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:44.520]   I wasn't clinically diagnosed with depression,
[00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:47.800]   but prior to that, or after, thank goodness,
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:52.640]   but I think what we're seeing with these compounds,
[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:55.520]   and from my own experience, if I may,
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:31:00.240]   is that they allow us to see relationships
[00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:04.800]   between events of past and present,
[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:07.580]   and hopefully anticipate certain actions
[00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:09.680]   and changes into the future,
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:12.920]   while experiencing the fullness of the emotionality
[00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:15.480]   of those experiences in real time.
[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:18.280]   So as somebody who's done an immense amount of therapy,
[00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:21.320]   I can tell you that I find great value in talk therapy.
[00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:25.040]   I do, especially of the, I think,
[00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:28.240]   what's called insight-oriented psychoanalysis,
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:31.520]   or psychotherapy, doesn't have to be classic psychoanalysis.
[00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:33.320]   Not just support, you need that,
[00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:34.800]   not just rapport, you need that,
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:38.920]   but insight as well is the goal, those three things.
[00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:40.680]   But one of the issues is,
[00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:42.520]   unless you get on the phone with your therapist,
[00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:43.620]   or you talk to them in person,
[00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:45.500]   in a moment where something is really acute,
[00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:47.740]   like it's really getting you right at that moment,
[00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:49.760]   sad, or happy, or whatever it may be,
[00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:55.680]   it's hard to experience the fullness of that issue
[00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:58.480]   in that moment, while also parsing it cognitively.
[00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:00.940]   And it does seem that the psychedelics,
[00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:02.360]   and to some extent MDMA,
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:05.500]   allow people to get into the full amplitude,
[00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:08.320]   maybe even enhanced amplitude,
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:10.360]   emotionality of an experience.
[00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:12.800]   And at the same time, allow people to reflect,
[00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:16.220]   and with the help of a so-called guide, or the therapist,
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:18.800]   take notes in a way that leads
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:22.560]   to specific actionable outcomes.
[00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:24.200]   And I think that's the real value,
[00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:27.360]   you can get real-time experience with insight,
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:28.860]   and of course you need support as well,
[00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:30.600]   and of course set, and setting, and safety
[00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:32.120]   are absolutely key.
[00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:34.320]   So psilocybin seems to do that in one manner,
[00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:37.000]   MDMA does it in a different way.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.960]   MDMA, by the way, we know,
[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:42.220]   dramatically increases serotonin and dopamine,
[00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:44.400]   but it seems to be the serotonergic effect
[00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:47.680]   that is responsible for most of its therapeutic effect.
[00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:51.880]   By the way, MDMA is methylenedioxymethamphetamine,
[00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:54.240]   which isn't necessarily saying that it's bad,
[00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:57.440]   what's actually interesting is that MDMA,
[00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:59.600]   ecstasy, provided that it's pure,
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:01.620]   and in the appropriate dosage range,
[00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:03.960]   does not seem to be neurotoxic,
[00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:05.240]   as it once was thought to be.
[00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:07.480]   The paper claiming that was retracted,
[00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:10.880]   they accidentally were giving the subjects in that study
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:17.200]   methamphetamine, not MDMA, and, right, yes, right,
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:18.480]   and they retracted the paper,
[00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:19.640]   but nobody talks about that paper,
[00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:21.060]   but do you know, it's kind of interesting,
[00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:23.160]   do you know where most of the data
[00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:26.520]   on the lack of toxicity of MDMA comes from?
[00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:28.960]   There's a beautiful set of studies
[00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:32.180]   that were carried out on subjects
[00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:36.040]   who were exclusively from the Church of Latter-day Saints,
[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:38.280]   sometimes referred to as Mormons, right?
[00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:41.200]   Mormons are an excellent test population
[00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:44.400]   for a study like that, because they don't do other drugs.
[00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:50.420]   But MDMA is not on the no-fly list.
[00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:53.220]   So apparently, according to these papers,
[00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:54.960]   and by the way, I have a lot of friends who are LDS,
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:57.120]   and they're wonderful people,
[00:33:57.120 --> 00:34:00.320]   according to these papers, which I believe,
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:01.540]   'cause they're published and peer-reviewed,
[00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:03.720]   and they still are in the literature,
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:05.640]   you can find subjects in that community,
[00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:10.200]   not all LDS folks are taking ecstasy, I don't think,
[00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:13.320]   but presumably no, but people who have taken
[00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:18.320]   anywhere from one to two to 50 to over 100 doses of MDMA
[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:19.480]   in a short period of time,
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:22.360]   and aside from a mild deficit in attention
[00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:24.880]   in the people who have taken the large doses,
[00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:26.960]   or frequent doses, that is,
[00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:30.240]   there do not seem to be many cognitive deficits
[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:33.880]   that are detectable, and certainly no apparent neurotoxicity,
[00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:36.600]   which is not to say go do MDMA as much as you like.
[00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:38.880]   I think there is the potential for neurotoxicity
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:41.600]   if it's taken too often, and things of that sort.
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:43.440]   So a lot to still figure out.
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:48.440]   But MDMA seems to have a slightly different trajectory
[00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:54.040]   than psilocybin, it tends to be less scary,
[00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:57.480]   although it is very sympathetic arousing, that is,
[00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:58.920]   so people can get afraid,
[00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:01.320]   or if they're elevated heart rate, et cetera.
[00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:04.560]   But the empathogenic component is really interesting,
[00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:07.460]   because ultimately, with PTSD,
[00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:11.320]   it's really about developing empathy for one's self.
[00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:13.880]   It's really about developing empathy for one's self,
[00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:16.160]   and resolving one of the core issues of trauma,
[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:17.600]   which is often not discussed,
[00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:20.120]   which is that at an unconscious level,
[00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:22.120]   at an unconscious level,
[00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:24.760]   trauma seems to be a confusion to the nervous system
[00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:26.680]   about who's responsible.
[00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:29.000]   So that even if somebody knows and understands,
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.160]   hey, that was them, they're the perpetrator,
[00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:36.160]   I'm the victim, somehow the nervous system gets confused
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:40.260]   about responsibility in a way that leads to triggering
[00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:43.760]   of some of the negative feelings around that event,
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:45.900]   or events, as the case may be.
[00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:49.980]   And MDMA seems to be able to intervene in that confusion,
[00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:53.100]   and short-circuit that confusion through this self-empathy.
[00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:55.040]   Self-empathy is something that I think
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:57.300]   deserves more exploration in the years to come.
[00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:59.060]   So a lot's happening there in the United States.
[00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:02.140]   MDMA is now being registered with the FDA
[00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:06.320]   for additional, perhaps for legalization.
[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:08.400]   Right now, it is still illegal.
[00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:11.120]   So if you take any of what I said tonight and go buy MDMA,
[00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:13.480]   I'm not at fault, okay?
[00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:15.440]   Getting in the sauna about two hours before going to sleep
[00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:16.640]   really improves my quality of sleep.
[00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:17.600]   What's going on here?
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:19.360]   Ah, love this.
[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:20.640]   This one can be pretty simple.
[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:23.720]   The relationship between temperature and sleep
[00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:26.440]   is a well-established one.
[00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:30.200]   To fall asleep, you need to cool down by one to three degrees.
[00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:31.440]   You've probably heard me say that before.
[00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:36.440]   To wake up, you need to heat up by about one to three degrees.
[00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:40.880]   And when you get into a sauna, or you take a hot bath,
[00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:44.500]   or even to a lesser degree, you wash your face
[00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:47.920]   with warm water in the evening, hands with warm water
[00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:51.640]   because of the way that the body thermoregulates,
[00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:54.160]   you actually end up cooling yourself off.
[00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:55.560]   You think, no, I got in the sauna.
[00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:56.920]   Actually, I've been going to the sauna
[00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:59.120]   at this place here, Recovery.
[00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:00.600]   They have a wonderful sauna, cold plunge.
[00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:02.760]   And then they have this bed where you float on the thing.
[00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:03.920]   Have you tried this thing?
[00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:05.040]   This thing is so cool.
[00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:07.360]   It's like a water bed, but it floats you.
[00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:08.720]   They're amazing, amazing.
[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:10.000]   By the way, they don't pay me to say that.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.280]   I'm just grateful that they let me sit in this bed.
[00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:14.120]   I've been sleeping in there as much as possible,
[00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:15.520]   but they shut down at night eventually,
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:16.640]   and then I gotta go home.
[00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:19.840]   So the sauna's a great tool before sleep,
[00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:24.000]   or a warm shower, or a hot bath, or a warm bath,
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.640]   for the following reason.
[00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:28.680]   The brain area that controls thermoregulation
[00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:30.400]   is the medial preoptic area,
[00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:32.000]   which operates like a thermostat.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.680]   So if you warm the external portion of the body,
[00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:37.400]   the brain has to then, what?
[00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:39.200]   Cool down your core body temperature.
[00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:40.440]   It doesn't happen right away,
[00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:42.720]   but it happens as you get out of the sauna,
[00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:45.320]   and maybe you take a warm, a shower, a cool shower.
[00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:48.200]   So what ends up happening is that you warmed up,
[00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:50.440]   which allows you to cool down internally,
[00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:51.680]   and then you're able to fall asleep
[00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:53.840]   and stay more deeply asleep.
[00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:55.120]   That's probably what's improving your sleep.
[00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:57.480]   In fact, a kind of mantra that I learned
[00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:58.600]   from the great Matt Walker,
[00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:00.400]   who wrote the great book "Why We Sleep,"
[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:01.800]   and by the way, we have a sleep series
[00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:05.000]   with the mighty Matt Walker coming out later this year.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.440]   We record six episodes,
[00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:08.360]   every aspect of sleep you can imagine.
[00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:13.120]   He says, and I hope I'm getting this right,
[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:18.120]   he says, "You need to warm up to cool down to go to sleep,
[00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:21.480]   "or to fall, warm up to cool down to fall asleep.
[00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:25.720]   "Stay cool to stay asleep, warm up to wake up."
[00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:26.600]   There you go.
[00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:30.800]   That's a straight bite out of Matt Walker's mouth,
[00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:34.000]   so he deserves that citation, not me.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.720]   So that's what's happening when you get in the sauna.
[00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:38.760]   Now, when you get into the cold plunge, you're cold,
[00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:39.600]   but guess what?
[00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:42.880]   Same thing, the surface of your body is cooler,
[00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:45.640]   those thermoreceptors transmit information
[00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:47.480]   to the medial preoptic area of your body,
[00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:50.800]   and your core body temperature eventually goes up,
[00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:51.920]   provided you don't stay in there
[00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:54.240]   and get hypothermic, of course, okay?
[00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:55.320]   People are always asking me,
[00:38:55.320 --> 00:39:00.320]   I have a good friend who just so happens to be straight edge.
[00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:03.040]   He's like, never even has a sip of caffeine.
[00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:05.320]   I don't know, it's a good thing because he's extreme,
[00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:07.960]   and he got a cold plunge, and he went in for a minute,
[00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:09.560]   and then the next day, he's like, "I did three minutes."
[00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:12.720]   And then pretty soon, he's like, "Hey, I got sick."
[00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:13.560]   And I was like, "What'd you do?"
[00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:14.720]   And he's like, "I got naked in the cold plunge
[00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:16.360]   "for 45 minutes."
[00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:18.280]   I was like, "Well, listen, first of all,
[00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:19.560]   "thank goodness you don't do drugs,
[00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:23.520]   "and second of all, easy does it, easy does it."
[00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:26.640]   The cold is a very powerful stimulus, as is heat.
[00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:30.480]   So minimal effective dose, have some fun with it,
[00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:31.720]   but don't go wild.
[00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:33.240]   I still don't know why you got in there naked,
[00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:34.480]   but who knows?
[00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:36.720]   If we expose ourselves to the same stress
[00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:38.680]   over and over again,
[00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:40.560]   do we release the same amount of adrenaline
[00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:41.920]   and it's positive negative impact
[00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:43.040]   and just becomes less receptive?
[00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:46.080]   Do we release less adrenaline, and hence, it's less harmful?
[00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:47.200]   It's a great question.
[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:48.360]   Depends on the context.
[00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:50.720]   Typically, you'd release less and less adrenaline.
[00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:53.000]   And actually, this relates to a really important fact
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.640]   about the ever-famous structure, the amygdala,
[00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:56.800]   which means almond.
[00:39:56.800 --> 00:40:00.200]   I don't know why I told you that.
[00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:02.880]   The, happens to be shaped like an almond.
[00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:05.120]   The amygdala, people associate
[00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:07.200]   with threat detection and danger,
[00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:10.960]   but it's actually a novelty detector, essentially.
[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:13.280]   And it's involved with a bunch of other brain circuits
[00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:16.080]   that anytime we experience something novel,
[00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:21.440]   we have an elevated level of autonomic arousal.
[00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:23.120]   Like earlier tonight, before the show,
[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:25.840]   there was a kind of a repeating dong, dong, dong.
[00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:27.440]   And the first time it happened, I'm like,
[00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:28.280]   "Fire alarm?
[00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:29.120]   "Like, what's going on?"
[00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:31.040]   By the time it happened five times,
[00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:32.200]   I was kind of like, "Meh."
[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:33.440]   So that sort of, if we had,
[00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:35.640]   I'd be willing to bet both amygdalas
[00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:38.440]   that had recorded from my amygdalas,
[00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:39.560]   it's got one on each side of the brain,
[00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:42.120]   you would find that the first time
[00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:43.360]   there's a big increase in activity,
[00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:45.280]   lesser, second, third, fourth, fifth,
[00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:47.720]   and you attenuate, you habituate.
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:51.360]   So if the stressor is one in which you don't care,
[00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:54.720]   it doesn't have much relevance to you, like that alarm,
[00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:58.840]   probably less and less adrenaline, I'd be willing to bet.
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:02.360]   However, if with each subsequent exposure,
[00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:04.880]   like somebody you really can't stand or something like that,
[00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:07.640]   it's decreasing your life satisfaction
[00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:09.800]   and increasing your level of cognitive
[00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:10.960]   or psychological stress,
[00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:12.520]   then it would go in the opposite direction.
[00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:15.240]   I think that's fair to say.
[00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:16.680]   Hey, hey, Andrew.
[00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:18.360]   I like that.
[00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:19.200]   I like that.
[00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:20.920]   Hey, that's cool.
[00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:21.760]   Yeah.
[00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:22.720]   The other day, it was really interesting.
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:24.200]   Every once in a while, someone will walk up and be like,
[00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:25.880]   "Hey, listen to the podcast, it's always nice.
[00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:27.120]   "It's always nice to meet people."
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:28.880]   And this kid walks up to me,
[00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:30.640]   this was in Melbourne, in the gym,
[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:32.640]   like this has never happened to me before.
[00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:33.480]   It was really cool.
[00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:35.800]   He just walks up, he goes, "Hey, Andrew."
[00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:36.640]   I'm like, "Cool."
[00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:37.480]   He just said, "That's it."
[00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:38.320]   And he just walked away.
[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:40.960]   I was like, "All right, cool."
[00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:43.440]   And I was like, "That kid is so mellow."
[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:44.280]   It was really cool.
[00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:45.920]   Like, I was like, we would have been friends.
[00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:46.760]   Actually, I would have been friends
[00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:47.680]   with all the wild ones,
[00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:49.560]   but it was a really interesting phenotype.
[00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:51.440]   Again, human phenotypes fascinate me.
[00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:53.000]   So if we run into each other on the street
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.480]   and I ask your name and we talk,
[00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:55.640]   I'm genuinely interested.
[00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:57.960]   I'm not studying you, I'm not taking notes or data,
[00:41:57.960 --> 00:41:59.400]   but people are so different.
[00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:00.240]   But hey, Andrew.
[00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:01.240]   Okay, so maybe it's him.
[00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:02.680]   (audience laughing)
[00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:03.560]   Hey, Andrew.
[00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:05.160]   Hey, Adi.
[00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:08.020]   I've found that I'm able to focus far better
[00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:09.420]   when I bounce my legs up and down
[00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:10.600]   while sitting on the balls of my feet.
[00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:11.440]   What's going on here?
[00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:12.900]   You got a lot of energy.
[00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:13.740]   That's what's going on.
[00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:15.580]   No, I think, you know,
[00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:19.780]   there isn't a ton of science on this,
[00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:23.040]   but it's very clear, as I mentioned earlier,
[00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:26.700]   that people have different spontaneous movement rates.
[00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:28.240]   And some people, you know,
[00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:30.240]   some people are a little bit more jittery.
[00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:33.960]   If you look, if you go into a classroom,
[00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:36.760]   young children, see them sitting around,
[00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:41.140]   boys and girls, let's say somewhere between four and six,
[00:42:41.140 --> 00:42:44.180]   oftentimes you'll notice that some of the kids
[00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:46.020]   can sit extremely still.
[00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:48.260]   And then some of the kids are like really like.
[00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:52.980]   And there is a chromosomal difference there.
[00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:57.980]   The boy, it's known that boys have a slower development
[00:42:57.980 --> 00:43:01.100]   of the so-called top-down inhibition from the forebrain.
[00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:03.140]   The prefrontal cortex, which frankly we hear about
[00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:04.700]   over and over again, many podcasts,
[00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:06.940]   a lot of description of the prefrontal cortex,
[00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:08.880]   its main job, the best description
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:10.080]   I've ever heard of it anyway,
[00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:12.940]   is from a friend who's a neurosurgeon at Neuralink
[00:43:12.940 --> 00:43:14.820]   who came up through my lab, Matt McDougall.
[00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:15.780]   He's been on the podcast.
[00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:18.380]   He says the job of the prefrontal cortex
[00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:22.340]   is to send connections to the rest of the brain
[00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:27.340]   and say, "Shh," basically, to the appropriate circuit.
[00:43:27.340 --> 00:43:30.720]   So that's why people with damage to the prefrontal cortex
[00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:33.140]   for any reason or degeneration of the prefrontal cortex
[00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:35.200]   find themselves doing things,
[00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:36.340]   or we find them doing things
[00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:38.620]   that are a little bit context inappropriate.
[00:43:38.620 --> 00:43:40.940]   And in some cases, dramatically inappropriate,
[00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:42.860]   but in most cases, just kind of context inappropriate.
[00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:45.820]   They don't suppress behavior very well.
[00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:50.700]   So it may be that a certain level of autonomic arousal
[00:43:50.700 --> 00:43:52.580]   brings us into that optimal,
[00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:53.980]   some people call it a flow state.
[00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:56.140]   A flow state is a little bit of a nebulous thing.
[00:43:56.140 --> 00:43:57.820]   I mean, I have great respect for Stephen Kotler
[00:43:57.820 --> 00:43:59.660]   and those that have talked about and written about flow,
[00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:02.820]   but what I really can just say about flow
[00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:04.120]   as it relates to neuroscience
[00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:06.420]   is that like backwards, it spells wolf.
[00:44:06.420 --> 00:44:08.400]   Like we don't really know that much more
[00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:10.460]   about like the neural basis of a flow state.
[00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:12.860]   But for each of us, we have these kind of tunnels
[00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:16.820]   that we like to be in where we find
[00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:19.180]   that our level of focus and action is just right.
[00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:23.060]   And so I don't think I'm going too far out on a limb here,
[00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:25.740]   Hadi, by saying that if you find that you focus best
[00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:28.800]   when you can dispel a little bit of that energy
[00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:31.980]   by moving your body, that you're able to do your best work,
[00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:33.560]   that makes sense to me.
[00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:34.840]   I don't do them so much anymore,
[00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:36.560]   but for years I would do surgeries,
[00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:38.460]   lots and lots of surgeries down the microscope,
[00:44:38.460 --> 00:44:40.180]   dissecting retinas, dissecting retinas.
[00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:41.900]   Like if you got an eyeball, I can dissect it,
[00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:44.740]   I'm good at it, I can do them in my sleep.
[00:44:44.740 --> 00:44:48.480]   And I would find that if I had a little bit too much energy
[00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:51.660]   that the forceps would jiggle a little bit
[00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:53.100]   and it wasn't a caffeine thing.
[00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:56.140]   And a friend of mine who's a world-class neurosurgeon,
[00:44:56.140 --> 00:44:58.300]   Eddie Chang, he's the chair of neurosurgery at UCSF,
[00:44:58.300 --> 00:45:00.020]   he's been on the podcast, and he said,
[00:45:00.020 --> 00:45:01.220]   ah, there's a solution to that
[00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:02.980]   that we learn in neurosurgery.
[00:45:02.980 --> 00:45:05.500]   They're like the astronauts of medicine.
[00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:07.820]   He said, you know, you tap your foot.
[00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:10.340]   I thought, oh, that's kind of cool, why would that work?
[00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:11.660]   He said, well, basically,
[00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:13.740]   you've got some sort of anticipatory activity
[00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:15.580]   in an area of the brain called the basal ganglia,
[00:45:15.580 --> 00:45:18.420]   which is involved in these go, no-go type actions.
[00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:21.540]   Like all of our actions are yes-go and no-go,
[00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:22.660]   don't do something else.
[00:45:22.660 --> 00:45:24.620]   So flexor extensor, there's all kind of stuff,
[00:45:24.620 --> 00:45:28.180]   very complicated, but it's seamless for most people.
[00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:31.780]   And when you have a bit too much anticipatory activity,
[00:45:31.780 --> 00:45:34.900]   you're getting ready to go like a sprinter out the blocks,
[00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:37.060]   and you're doing something that's very important,
[00:45:37.060 --> 00:45:39.500]   like a brain surgery, in his case,
[00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:42.880]   or a microsurgery, in my case, for research purposes,
[00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:45.100]   that if your activation state is too high,
[00:45:45.100 --> 00:45:46.660]   that you can dispel some of that energy
[00:45:46.660 --> 00:45:48.660]   by just simply tapping your foot
[00:45:48.660 --> 00:45:50.180]   or doing some sort of rhythmic activity
[00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:51.660]   with another part of your body,
[00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:53.580]   appropriate to that context, of course.
[00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:57.820]   Last question, I don't know.
[00:45:57.820 --> 00:46:04.620]   Hey, Andrew, yeah, oh, oh, they skipped that one.
[00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:05.820]   I guess that's the new thing.
[00:46:05.820 --> 00:46:08.020]   I'll never forget when I got my lab for the first time.
[00:46:08.020 --> 00:46:10.780]   I came up in an era when it was still pretty formal.
[00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:13.100]   Neuroscience, you'd say, "Hey, Professor so-and-so,"
[00:46:13.100 --> 00:46:14.820]   and then they'd say, "You can call me Barbara,"
[00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:15.980]   and I'd be like, "Hey, Barbara."
[00:46:15.980 --> 00:46:18.540]   But before that, no one, you don't need the hey or that,
[00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:20.060]   and I'll never forget that in my lab,
[00:46:20.060 --> 00:46:21.860]   my first graduate student, who's now a professor,
[00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:23.520]   he's a very, very talented scientist
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:25.220]   at the University of Utah,
[00:46:25.220 --> 00:46:27.420]   and I got a text from him, and it just said,
[00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:29.960]   she called me Andy, she said,
[00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:33.060]   "Hey, Andy, when are you gonna buy us an espresso maker?"
[00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:35.220]   It was like the second day, and I was like, whoa.
[00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:36.900]   Times have changed, so I think it's good.
[00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:38.780]   I think the lack of formality is actually good.
[00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:40.020]   At first, I was like, wait a second,
[00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:41.660]   I waited my whole life to become a professor,
[00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:43.100]   and now it's, hey, Andy?
[00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:46.580]   But I think, you know, with the years,
[00:46:46.580 --> 00:46:48.860]   I've realized that it's actually kind of nice.
[00:46:48.860 --> 00:46:50.680]   I'm 17 years old.
[00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:52.940]   Congratulations, man, I wish I,
[00:46:52.940 --> 00:46:55.100]   you didn't wanna know me when I was a nice kid,
[00:46:55.100 --> 00:46:57.020]   but I was just, I had a lot of confusion.
[00:46:57.020 --> 00:46:58.500]   I'm 17 years old,
[00:46:58.500 --> 00:47:01.020]   so you're in a psychedelic experience of youth.
[00:47:01.020 --> 00:47:03.420]   What is your biggest advice on finding your passion?
[00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:08.420]   Oh, well, goodness gracious, I think you know,
[00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:11.020]   if I'm honest, I think,
[00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:12.180]   we talked about it a little bit earlier,
[00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:17.020]   I think your passion is rooted in a feeling state
[00:47:17.020 --> 00:47:21.060]   that you've already accessed, hopefully many times,
[00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:23.840]   but at least one time earlier in your life,
[00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:27.260]   when, for whatever reason or circumstances,
[00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:30.300]   you weren't thinking about what your parents
[00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:32.980]   wanted you to do, what was cool or not cool
[00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:37.420]   in school, you were in a pure feeling state of yum.
[00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:45.620]   That's really cool, behold.
[00:47:45.620 --> 00:47:51.060]   And so I can't answer the question for you,
[00:47:51.060 --> 00:47:54.260]   but I'll tell you, yes, continue to forage.
[00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:58.260]   I do believe that learning is among the most wonderful
[00:47:58.260 --> 00:48:00.380]   things that we can do for ourselves,
[00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:05.380]   but that if you spend some time in your memory banks,
[00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:08.780]   that you'll be able to remember a feeling,
[00:48:08.780 --> 00:48:11.480]   and maybe the feeling was about a board game you played
[00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:13.660]   or something you observed,
[00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:17.920]   or maybe it just came about through some other activity
[00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:20.020]   and the feeling is unrelated to the activity.
[00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:22.380]   That's where it gets a little tricky.
[00:48:22.380 --> 00:48:24.280]   And we're answering this question for a 17-year-old,
[00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:25.900]   but it's true for all of us.
[00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:26.980]   This is where it gets a little tricky,
[00:48:26.980 --> 00:48:29.680]   is that sometimes we think it's the activity,
[00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:31.220]   but it's not the activity.
[00:48:31.220 --> 00:48:34.640]   Lord knows, I stay out of the Aquaria stores these days.
[00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:38.060]   Because if I go near one, it's all over.
[00:48:38.060 --> 00:48:43.060]   No, it's the delight in something that is very personal,
[00:48:43.060 --> 00:48:46.420]   in fact, I think is very unique to you,
[00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:48.880]   to the extent that, and I do believe this,
[00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:53.820]   that it's not capable of being created by anybody else,
[00:48:53.820 --> 00:48:56.980]   and that feedback from other people about what we should do
[00:48:56.980 --> 00:48:59.320]   or what we're good at, while it can be useful,
[00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:05.260]   it's merely a calibration point for saying,
[00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:07.060]   like someone says, "Maybe you should do this,"
[00:49:07.060 --> 00:49:11.000]   and you go, "Eh," or like, "Meh," or like, "Yuck."
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:14.200]   Those are all just calibration points on this compass
[00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:16.580]   to take you back to that feeling state.
[00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:18.220]   So I apologize for not having
[00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:21.800]   a more concrete mechanistic works-the-first-time-works-every-time
[00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:26.000]   kind of instant tool, like a physiological sigh.
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.940]   Rather, this is going to have to be some self-exploration,
[00:49:28.940 --> 00:49:31.780]   but the good news is, you're 17, your brain's still plastic.
[00:49:31.780 --> 00:49:35.140]   The good news is, all of us are capable of neuroplasticity
[00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:37.420]   throughout the lifespan, and the good news is,
[00:49:37.420 --> 00:49:39.500]   all of us are capable of introspection
[00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:40.940]   throughout the lifespan.
[00:49:40.940 --> 00:49:44.420]   So even if you can't remember, you can sense,
[00:49:44.420 --> 00:49:47.140]   and if you can sense, what you're doing is you're feeling.
[00:49:47.140 --> 00:49:47.960]   What is this?
[00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:50.020]   I don't want to turn this into a neuroscience lesson,
[00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:54.860]   but I'd be remiss if I didn't say that you're perceiving
[00:49:54.860 --> 00:49:58.100]   and feeling on the basis of converting
[00:49:58.100 --> 00:50:00.240]   physical information in your environment,
[00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:04.180]   sound waves, photons, mechanical pressure,
[00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:06.860]   chemicals going in through your nose and mouth.
[00:50:06.860 --> 00:50:09.620]   You're converting that into electrical and chemical signals.
[00:50:09.620 --> 00:50:14.620]   That's what being and perceiving really is.
[00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:16.820]   It can't be anything else.
[00:50:16.820 --> 00:50:21.820]   So there's something about the way that you're wired, Oscar,
[00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:26.920]   that is different and leads you to say yum.
[00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:32.480]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that, that, that.
[00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:33.920]   And for me, I've always associated
[00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:36.360]   with a certain physical sensation in this arm.
[00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:37.680]   Don't ask me why.
[00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:39.120]   I don't even know.
[00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:43.220]   And if you can sense into what it is
[00:50:43.220 --> 00:50:45.380]   that gets you going in that direction,
[00:50:45.380 --> 00:50:47.620]   if any and all of us do that,
[00:50:47.620 --> 00:50:52.100]   then I really believe you can sense into your unique gifts.
[00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:53.260]   Or maybe you just need to sit back
[00:50:53.260 --> 00:50:56.020]   and think in deliberate, complete sentences for an hour
[00:50:56.020 --> 00:50:57.780]   like Rick or one of those other geniuses.
[00:50:57.780 --> 00:50:59.020]   I don't have a better answer.
[00:50:59.020 --> 00:51:00.240]   That's the best I can do.
[00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:01.960]   Thanks so much, yeah.
[00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:05.120]   (audience applauding)
[00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:08.500]   Thank you, thank you so much.
[00:51:08.500 --> 00:51:13.800]   Thank you, thanks so much.
[00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:17.300]   Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:18.300]   Thank you so much.
[00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:23.540]   So just as a final note this evening,
[00:51:23.540 --> 00:51:25.660]   I just want to thank everyone for coming out.
[00:51:25.660 --> 00:51:28.420]   As Rob mentioned, you know, come out.
[00:51:28.420 --> 00:51:29.980]   As far as I know, there's no alcohol here.
[00:51:29.980 --> 00:51:31.460]   People are here, amazing.
[00:51:31.460 --> 00:51:34.960]   An event with no alcohol on a Saturday night
[00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:39.960]   in this beautiful Sydney summer where we talk science.
[00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:42.260]   Thanks for letting me tell some stories, learn some stories.
[00:51:42.260 --> 00:51:44.100]   My real wish, my deep wish,
[00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:47.700]   is that everyone do some level of introspection,
[00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:50.160]   if not tonight, going forward.
[00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:53.180]   And I so appreciate that people are interested
[00:51:53.180 --> 00:51:55.340]   in the concepts around science and health.
[00:51:55.340 --> 00:51:58.040]   And the really big, big wish for me,
[00:51:58.040 --> 00:51:59.780]   maybe I'll even just call it an ask,
[00:51:59.780 --> 00:52:03.780]   is that I truly don't develop the protocols.
[00:52:03.780 --> 00:52:05.280]   I mine them.
[00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:06.460]   Occasionally I develop them,
[00:52:06.460 --> 00:52:11.020]   but I mine them from the rich sources of information
[00:52:11.020 --> 00:52:14.860]   in papers and elsewhere and put them into a format
[00:52:14.860 --> 00:52:18.180]   that I'm deeply appreciative people enjoy digesting
[00:52:18.180 --> 00:52:20.220]   and hopefully apply, but hopefully share.
[00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:22.080]   And I certainly don't need attribution.
[00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:24.060]   None of them are named after me intentionally
[00:52:24.060 --> 00:52:26.440]   because that's not gonna give them any information
[00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:28.500]   about what they do or how they work.
[00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:30.820]   And last but certainly not least,
[00:52:30.820 --> 00:52:32.740]   thank you for your interest in science.
[00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:35.900]   (audience applauding)
[00:52:40.020 --> 00:52:41.660]   - Thank you to the Sydney Opera House Trust
[00:52:41.660 --> 00:52:44.820]   for their hospitality and for making this event possible.
[00:52:44.820 --> 00:52:46.820]   And last but certainly not least,
[00:52:46.820 --> 00:52:48.820]   thank you for your interest in science.
[00:52:48.820 --> 00:52:51.400]   (upbeat music)
[00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:53.460]   you
