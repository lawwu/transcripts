[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.460]   When Italians moved to America, that got Americans eating more spaghetti, right?
[00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.060]   And if you just did a simple assimilation analysis, you'd say, "Wow, everybody in
[00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.060]   America eats the same now, like they eat burgers and spaghetti.
[00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:12.620]   So look, the Italians assimilated."
[00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.660]   But migrants assimilate us.
[00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.440]   Native Americans certainly changed in response to the movement of Europeans.
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.940]   English Americans certainly changed in response to the migration
[00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.140]   of German and Irish Americans.
[00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.440]   So this meeting in the middle is something that happens all the time, and not just
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.360]   through democratic channels, just through the sort of soft contact of cultural
[00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.860]   norms that sociologists and psychologists would understand.
