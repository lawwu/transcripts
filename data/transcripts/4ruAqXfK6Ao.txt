[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   - Jason, do you wanna go up to the bedroom,
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.040]   knock on the door and wake Chamath up?
[00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.360]   - Where is he?
[00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.040]   - You're in his house, go get him.
[00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.080]   Let's go. - He's at the office.
[00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:07.920]   He went to the office.
[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.600]   He's not here. - Oh, he went to the office.
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.600]   - We're trying to find Chamath at the moment.
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.240]   Oh, here's Chamath, okay.
[00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.920]   - Are you wearing my goddamn sweater?
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.820]   What is, what is?
[00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:17.660]   Is that my, you're in my house.
[00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:18.760]   - Chamath, Chamath. - Is that my sweater?
[00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.080]   No, I am so tilted.
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.040]   Where is my wife?
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.680]   What the (beep)?
[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.120]   - Don't worry about your wife.
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.880]   - Oh, oh my God. - Amore.
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.040]   Amore, this part is great.
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.400]   - Where is Nat? - Hold on,
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.880]   hold on, Nat. - I didn't get anything else.
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.360]   - Take off my sweater. - Oh, Amore.
[00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.200]   - It's okay. - Amore.
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.560]   - Don't touch my wife. - Amore.
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:35.380]   - Oh my God. - There she is.
[00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:36.220]   - Oh my Lord. - I didn't get
[00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.060]   anything else.
[00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.560]   - Oh my Lord, she's tainted. - Oh my God, no.
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.400]   I'm so tilted, I thought I was tainted.
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.800]   - Amore. - Hey, don't you worry,
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:42.640]   Amore.
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.720]   - You know your cashmere sweater, it's so, so soft.
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.680]   - Take my sweater off. - It's so soft, Amore.
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:48.920]   - It's great. - This is so tilting.
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:49.760]   Get out of my house. - I hope you have
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:50.600]   everything you need. - I have everything.
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.420]   - Take my sweater. - Good Lord.
[00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.220]   - We've done at one o'clock, so I'll see you then.
[00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.640]   - Please let me know if-- - Should we have lunch
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.420]   in the garden? - Yes, please.
[00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.260]   - Lunch in the garden.
[00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.100]   Wear something simple.
[00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.220]   Don't get all, something simple is great.
[00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.020]   - Is that the cashmere sweater with the rhino horn buttons?
[00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:06.320]   - It is, you know what?
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.060]   I did some shopping while I was here.
[00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.420]   I did a little shopping, so I just, I filled up.
[00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.460]   You know, I just, these Aesop's are great,
[00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:16.740]   'cause I don't have these at my house.
[00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.420]   I have ivory soap, so I got a couple of these
[00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.260]   from the guest room. - Put it back, it's sticky.
[00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:22.140]   - But you know what, I agree.
[00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.220]   This sweater's not so great.
[00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.040]   I think I'm gonna switch to this one.
[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.380]   - Oh my God, don't touch that sweater, Jason.
[00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.940]   - This one's incredible. - I cannot.
[00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.800]   - You're actually tilting him, J.K.L.
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:30.640]   - Don't, don't, don't. - He's actually tilting.
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.460]   - I think I'm gonna switch sweaters.
[00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:32.300]   - Don't put it on, please, don't.
[00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.380]   - All right, I won't put it on, but you know what?
[00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.140]   This port, I'm not so sure.
[00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.300]   Sean?
[00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.140]   Sean, yes.
[00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.620]   - Oh my God, the port's in. - Don't do it, Sean.
[00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.500]   - Sean, the port's great, but any other options?
[00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.380]   - We do have a delicious ice wine for you.
[00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.780]   - Come around here, let's present.
[00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.260]   Let's present, so we just put them away.
[00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.080]   - Disloyal people. - So what do we have?
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.920]   Come on, you're not on camera.
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.980]   - My wife, my chef, Sean. - Don't, don't, don't.
[00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.320]   - Yeah, Sean. - There's Sean.
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.620]   - This is, it looks like a deep pull.
[00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.140]   1986 Chateau Coutet Balsak?
[00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.340]   I mean, this looks like it's worth opening.
[00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.860]   I mean, it was in the rack that said don't open,
[00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:09.980]   right, Sean? - Yes, sir.
[00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:10.820]   - All right, so let's put this on ice.
[00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.020]   - Well, that's no good, just pour it out.
[00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.460]   - But you know what, pour half out,
[00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.420]   'cause I like the bottom half, the texture.
[00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.580]   So just pour half into the garden here with the spinach,
[00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:20.660]   and then I'll take the bottom half.
[00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.540]   Thank you. - Please take off my sweater.
[00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.480]   Oh my God, this is so brutal.

[00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.860]   - Don't let your winners ride.

[00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.380]   - And instead, we open-sourced it to the fans,
[00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.100]   and they've just gone crazy with it.
[00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.300]   - Love you guys. - Ice Queen of Quinoa.

[00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.340]   - Did you have a good night's sleep at Chamath's house?
[00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.620]   How did you sleep last night?
[00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:46.900]   - I slept so good.
[00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.220]   Let me tell you something.
[00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.180]   I will compare my sleep here tonight.
[00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.740]   The lady of Sax Manor just texted me,
[00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.100]   and she would like me to stay there tonight.
[00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.780]   So you know, when I'm in the valley,
[00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:56.980]   I get a lot of different invites.
[00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.620]   I have to spread the wealth.
[00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.860]   So I'll be dining with the Saxes tonight,
[00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.660]   and I may be staying at Sax's,
[00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:03.500]   so that will help me with the wardrobe.
[00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:04.700]   - Put your silverware away, Sax.
[00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.140]   Hide the Aesop soap from the bathroom.
[00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.540]   - I'm hoping he doesn't have Aesop.
[00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:09.380]   I'm hoping he has something else.
[00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:10.220]   - Keep the closet locked.
[00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.020]   - This is like when he stole the Papi van Winkle
[00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.340]   from my plane, remember that?
[00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.340]   (laughing)
[00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.420]   - No, that was good.
[00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.980]   - Yeah, I mean, it was three quarters of a bottle.
[00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.020]   It's just sitting there.
[00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.820]   I mean, when are you gonna drink it?
[00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.260]   - Sax, how do you prepare
[00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.660]   for J. Cal coming over to your house
[00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.020]   to visit and spend the night?
[00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.020]   I mean, what do you do?
[00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.980]   - He thinks that anything that's not bolted down
[00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.740]   is basically, it's like a gift.
[00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.140]   It's like a freebie.
[00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.300]   (laughing)
[00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.180]   - How do you think I got that love seat in my kitchen?
[00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.140]   I got that love seat off the kitchen?
[00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.340]   That came from Sax's designer, yeah.
[00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.780]   Yeah, I just had two guys.
[00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.900]   My brother Josh came, we took it out the back.
[00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:45.740]   It was fun.
[00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:46.580]   (laughing)
[00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:47.420]   - We took it out the back.
[00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.540]   - If I'm a guest, I'm leaving with something.
[00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:50.780]   - Why don't you wanna moderate today?
[00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:51.660]   You're on fire.
[00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.060]   Just moderate the show.
[00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:54.660]   - Well, no, I was gonna be traveling
[00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:55.820]   and I wanted to do a good job
[00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.940]   and I thought maybe you would love
[00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.380]   to get your chance at moderation, so.
[00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.980]   Lead us off here, fearless Dave Friedberg.
[00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.260]   - Okay, well, so that is the announcement
[00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.100]   to start the show.
[00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.220]   Jason, taking a week off from moderating.
[00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.060]   - Yes.
[00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:12.100]   - Gonna be a bestie guestie.
[00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.340]   Gonna be a participant on the panel this week

[00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.740]   but a lot of people said they wish
[00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:34.580]   they could have been a part of it.

[00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.580]   - Is our attendance required at this thing?
[00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:26.420]   (laughing)
[00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:27.620]   - I knew that was coming.
[00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.660]   - I have no desire to participate in this.
[00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.140]   - You don't wanna be able to hold a party at SACS.
[00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:36.260]   - Everybody in the world wants to do something except SACS.
[00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.700]   - I thought I was signing up for a podcast.
[00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.060]   I don't know why I need to do all these events.
[00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.580]   - This is literally a two minute drive
[00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:45.060]   from your house in San Francisco.
[00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.020]   We are gonna load you in a van.
[00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.060]   J. Cal and his brothers are gonna come and grab you,
[00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.860]   throw you in the back, drag you down there.
[00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.540]   We're gonna prop you up on stage for a couple hours
[00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.580]   and then we'll put you back in the van and you can go home.
[00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.500]   - The good news is we might drink some tequila, SACS.
[00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:00.340]   - That's true.
[00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:01.180]   - We might have some tequila,
[00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.540]   so we have something to look forward to.
[00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.420]   And you get to see your friends.
[00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:06.620]   You get to see your friends.
[00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.260]   That's worth it, right?
[00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:09.100]   - Say yes, Dave.
[00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:10.700]   That's what you say once.
[00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.540]   - No comment, he says.
[00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:14.060]   - For those of you listening.
[00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.220]   - I'm happy seeing you guys through Zoom.
[00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.980]   You know, we can minimize the in-person stuff.
[00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.940]   - Pandemic was his favorite holiday of all time.
[00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:24.420]   What's your favorite holiday, SACS?
[00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:25.660]   Pandemic.
[00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.300]   Can we have that back?
[00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:28.140]   - Pandemic.
[00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:30.820]   - He celebrates the pandemic for six months every year.
[00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:33.580]   It's part of his new ritual
[00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.380]   to not see anybody for six months.
[00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.020]   Bring back the pandemic.
[00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:40.300]   SACS, are you serving wagyu tonight?
[00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.420]   - I mean, that's possible.
[00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:43.540]   I'm gonna tell him not to do anything
[00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:45.780]   that nice, though, for J. Cal.
[00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.500]   - Keep it simple.
[00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.020]   Burgers and dogs.
[00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:50.500]   - Have you put your order in, J. Cal?
[00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:51.340]   J. Cal, what did you put your order in at?
[00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:53.620]   - Well, you know, I talked to Chef,
[00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:56.540]   and he said morels, not in season,
[00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:59.900]   but we are on the tail end of black truffle,
[00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:00.940]   so we have that locked in,
[00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:02.460]   but we're too early for morels, obviously.
[00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:03.300]   That's a spring.
[00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.140]   - Okay, Jason, Jason, let's give feedback
[00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:07.420]   about last night's dinner.
[00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:08.260]   Sean's--
[00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.500]   - I mean, let's be honest.
[00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:13.260]   Picanha is an underrated cut of meat.
[00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.820]   It's a very, people say it's like a serviceable meat,
[00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:18.660]   but when cooked properly, with proper technique,
[00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:20.260]   it will stand right up there
[00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.420]   with a ribeye or a New York strip.
[00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:23.260]   - It's the best.
[00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:24.100]   - But people don't believe that.
[00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:24.940]   - What's a picanha?
[00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:25.780]   I've never even heard of that.
[00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:27.620]   - It's like the shoulder.
[00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:29.860]   - It's like, it's the Brazilian word for it,
[00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:31.220]   but it's like a specific kind of meat.
[00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:32.700]   Sean did it last night.
[00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:33.940]   Honestly, David, I'm telling you,
[00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:36.340]   it's better than any other cut of meat you could get.
[00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:39.620]   If it's properly made, Sean crushed it yesterday,
[00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:42.260]   but it is bananas.
[00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.100]   It's so good.
[00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:44.940]   - You call this--
[00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:45.780]   - I think I like--
[00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:46.620]   - It's a sirloin.
[00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:47.940]   - Oh, it's a rump steak.
[00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:48.780]   It's like a rump steak.
[00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:49.620]   - I like it more than ribeye.
[00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:50.460]   - Yeah.
[00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:51.340]   - I like it more than ribeye, 100%.
[00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:53.660]   I like it more than the New York strip.
[00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:54.540]   That's terrible.
[00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:56.380]   Filet, terrible.
[00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:57.620]   No fat.
[00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:00.860]   - It's got a fat cap on it,
[00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:04.100]   which can sometimes be a little overwhelming for people,
[00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:07.820]   but Sean did a great job of kind of meeting us halfway.
[00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:10.700]   So it wasn't so fatty, just a nice layer of fat,
[00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:13.260]   crisped perfectly, cooked to perfection.
[00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:14.540]   Carrots were great.
[00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:16.620]   - I would eat that every day if I could.
[00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:17.460]   Every day.
[00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:18.300]   - I had no notes.
[00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:19.900]   I talked to Sean after, I had no notes.
[00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:20.740]   - Okay.
[00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:21.580]   - What about the apple tart?
[00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:23.220]   - The apple tart was ridiculous, too.
[00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:24.060]   - Oh my God.
[00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:24.900]   - I only like New York.
[00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:25.720]   - The burnt sugar apple.
[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:26.620]   - The burnt sugar apple tart.
[00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:27.460]   What the fuck?
[00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:28.460]   - You're a New York steak guy?
[00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:29.580]   - I'm a New York steak guy.
[00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:30.420]   Well done.
[00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:31.260]   - Oh my God.
[00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:32.080]   - Oh my God.
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:32.920]   - What?
[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:33.760]   - Oh.
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:34.580]   - Oh.
[00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:35.420]   - Oh, that's disgusting.
[00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:36.260]   - You guys are savages.
[00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:37.620]   I think you just lost, like,
[00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:39.380]   I think you just lost three swing states
[00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:41.820]   by saying you want to overcook a shrimp steak.
[00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:43.700]   - If you're going to do something au poivre,
[00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:44.860]   I would go to the New York.
[00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:46.900]   I'm fine to deal with the New York in an au poivre,
[00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:49.060]   but well done, David Sacks.
[00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:50.860]   That is unacceptable.
[00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:54.140]   - Shout out to Raul's and Balthazar,
[00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:57.900]   two best steak au poivres in Manhattan, in my estimation.
[00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:59.140]   - All right, everybody.
[00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:00.060]   - Let's get started.
[00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:00.980]   - Welcome to--
[00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:02.540]   - Why don't we call an audible tonight
[00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:04.060]   and go for steak au poivre, yeah.
[00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:06.540]   Just throw out the miso cod and the wagyu
[00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:08.220]   and let's just redo it.
[00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:10.100]   - Boys, welcome to the All In Pod.
[00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:13.020]   This is episode 201,
[00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:14.100]   and we're going to kick it off
[00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:16.540]   by talking about what's going on in markets,
[00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:20.220]   which is one of the kind of most interesting,
[00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:23.300]   challenging enigmas of the day,
[00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:26.020]   or maybe it's not, maybe it's pretty simple.
[00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:28.620]   But there seems to be a diversion in assets
[00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:31.900]   that is pretty unusual that hasn't been seen in some time,
[00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:34.540]   and a lot of market commentators, analysts, economists
[00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:38.300]   are kind of trying to figure out what's going on and why.
[00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:39.980]   The first is that bonds are falling.
[00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:42.420]   So U.S. treasury yields,
[00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:46.380]   as a result of bonds declining in price, have spiked up.
[00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:48.740]   We nearly hit the 10-year yield,
[00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:53.060]   dropping as low as 3.5 in September,
[00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:57.340]   obviously leading up to the big 50-bit rate cut.
[00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:59.220]   And as of this morning,
[00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:02.460]   we're seeing the 10-year yield over 4.25.
[00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:06.340]   At the same time, we're seeing gold prices spike.
[00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:08.380]   So gold is typically a safe asset,
[00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:11.260]   and gold has moved considerably, as you all can see here,
[00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:12.180]   from the start of the year,
[00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:15.020]   where it was around 2,000 an ounce, up to 2,750 an ounce,
[00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:16.620]   an incredible run-up,
[00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:20.100]   one of the best-performing assets of the year.
[00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:22.100]   And then finally, in a market like this,
[00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:24.580]   you would typically see pain in equities,
[00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:25.980]   but we've seen the opposite.
[00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:29.100]   The S&P 500 is up considerably,
[00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:30.540]   has been on this endless run-up,
[00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:32.620]   all-time high, it's closing at all-time high.
[00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:33.900]   - Where's your Bitcoin chart, buddy?
[00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:35.340]   - And let's pull up Bitcoin.
[00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:37.100]   - Why are you showing gold?
[00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:39.620]   Nobody cares about gold, show Bitcoin.
[00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:41.460]   - Well, there's a lot more assets
[00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:42.660]   that have moved into gold than Bitcoin,
[00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:46.500]   but here's Bitcoin at, today, this morning, 68,000.
[00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:48.820]   - Who picked that at the beginning of the year?
[00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:51.060]   So was it me?
[00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:52.060]   - Hold on one second.
[00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:53.860]   - Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.
[00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:54.700]   (laughing)
[00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:57.500]   Hold you up, give us your read on what's going on.
[00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:59.580]   - There's another couple of nuances here
[00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:00.940]   that I think are important.
[00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:06.140]   The US dollar complex is thriving,
[00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:08.340]   which means the US dollar is strong.
[00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:12.660]   Back-end yields are rising.
[00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:16.300]   And then another thing that I look at
[00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:17.820]   is this thing called put-call skews,
[00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:19.820]   so basically, on balance,
[00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:22.020]   how are people hedging in the short-term?
[00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:24.540]   And in the bond market,
[00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:27.580]   they own a lot more puts than they do calls.
[00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:31.220]   I think that this is the entire
[00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:33.820]   financial infrastructure of the world
[00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:38.580]   repositioning itself from what was a toss-up election
[00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:40.060]   to a Trump win.
[00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:45.100]   And when you look at why,
[00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:46.420]   it's because when you,
[00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:48.580]   forget the candidates themselves for a second,
[00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:50.780]   but if you think about the actual policies
[00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:52.540]   and where the spending will occur,
[00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:56.060]   I think that there has been a very clear decision
[00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:59.340]   that the Trump economic plan
[00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:01.780]   will drive better growth than the Harris plan.
[00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:06.060]   And if you think that there is more growth coming,
[00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:09.860]   typically what will come with that
[00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:11.940]   is a little bit more inflation.
[00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:16.220]   The risk premium that you're going to need
[00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:18.060]   in a high-growth environment is higher.
[00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:19.020]   What is risk premium?
[00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:22.180]   That is, how much do I want to invest
[00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:24.340]   for a risky asset versus a safe asset?
[00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:29.020]   And so all of these things are coalescing.
[00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:33.340]   So I think that the short-term takeaway that I have
[00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:35.740]   just looking at all of this data
[00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:40.740]   is that in the economic distribution of outcomes,
[00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:44.700]   this is now tilted overwhelmingly to a Trump win.
[00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:46.500]   And this is not an emotional statement
[00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:48.140]   or what I want to happen,
[00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:49.660]   but this is just an observation
[00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:52.100]   of how tens of trillions of dollars
[00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:57.060]   of self-interested financial actors
[00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:59.500]   have now repositioned their risk.
[00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:01.060]   And if Trump wins,
[00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:04.460]   which it looks like he's increasingly going to do,
[00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:06.740]   and if he wins by the margins
[00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:08.700]   that it looks like it's going to do,
[00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:11.540]   you're gonna see a lot of these things exacerbate.
[00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:13.980]   Gold's gonna go up more probably.
[00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:16.380]   Bitcoin will probably go up.
[00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:19.540]   The short-term economic upside for the economy
[00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:22.260]   will probably get reflected in higher equity prices,
[00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.860]   but it'll also push out long-term rates.
[00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:29.020]   The inflation picture becomes a little bit murkier,
[00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:31.980]   but I think that that's what's happening.
[00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:33.580]   I think that the financial markets
[00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:35.100]   are pricing in a Trump win.
[00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:36.740]   - Sorry, just to understand better,
[00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:38.780]   why does gold go up in a Trump win?
[00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:41.180]   - I think in the short-term what happens
[00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:42.900]   is that you see more economic growth,
[00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:44.700]   but in the medium-term inflation goes up,
[00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:45.860]   and so you want to hedge.
[00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:46.700]   - Right.
[00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:49.340]   - So it's more about a durational balance of assets.
[00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:50.300]   So in the short-term,
[00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:53.060]   you'll be long the things that will generate earnings,
[00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:54.540]   but in the medium to long-term,
[00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:55.820]   you want to hedge yourself.
[00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:58.540]   So Bitcoin and gold, I think, will trade that way.
[00:13:58.540 --> 00:13:59.980]   - Well, let's pull up the video clip
[00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:01.460]   from Paul Tudor Jones, Nick.
[00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:03.140]   - Given all of the things you're saying,
[00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:05.740]   are you off buying gold and Bitcoin
[00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:06.580]   and hiding somewhere?
[00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:09.460]   - I think all roads lead to inflation.
[00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:11.980]   We're gonna end up, if you, so--
[00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:13.220]   - But does all roads lead to inflation,
[00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:14.460]   therefore gold is a good investment?
[00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:15.820]   Is Bitcoin a good investment to you?
[00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:18.180]   - I'm long gold, I'm long Bitcoin.
[00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:21.140]   I think commodities are so ridiculously under-owned,
[00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:23.260]   so I'm long commodities.
[00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.780]   I think most young people find their inflation hedges
[00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:28.340]   via the NASDAQ, that's also been great.
[00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:30.460]   It's probably some combination.
[00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:33.420]   I probably have some basket of gold, Bitcoin,
[00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:35.460]   commodities, NASDAQ, something like that,
[00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:37.540]   and I would own zero fixed income.
[00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:40.300]   If I had my cash, it'd be very short-term.
[00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:41.420]   - Sax?
[00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:43.620]   - Well, I think, as you heard right there,
[00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:45.700]   the key line that Paul Tudor Jones said
[00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:47.140]   was all roads lead to inflation.
[00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:49.180]   I mean, that's what's basically happening right now
[00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:54.180]   is that the market is afraid that inflation is not whipped
[00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:56.100]   and is gonna resurface,
[00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:59.140]   and the Fed may have to pivot from the pivot
[00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:00.380]   and raise interest rates.
[00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:03.220]   That's why he doesn't wanna own any treasuries.
[00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:07.380]   Separately, another financial legend, Stan Druckenmiller,
[00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:10.620]   gave an interview where he has something
[00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:13.140]   like a 20% short position,
[00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:15.740]   meaning 20% of his holdings
[00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:17.740]   are short U.S. treasuries right now.
[00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:21.940]   So he's betting that there are long-term inflation pressures
[00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:23.940]   and that rates are gonna have to rise,
[00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:26.340]   and you're seeing, again,
[00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:28.940]   that since the Fed cut rates on September 18th
[00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:33.060]   by 50 basis points, that the 10-year T-bills yield
[00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:35.820]   has risen by 60 basis points.
[00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:38.740]   So I think my interpretation
[00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:40.500]   is that this is less about the election
[00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:43.380]   and more about the markets
[00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:47.340]   not liking the Fed's rate cut on September 18th.
[00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:50.580]   I think that in hindsight, it was too big.
[00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:52.100]   We discussed it on the show,
[00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:54.420]   and I pointed out that the 50 basis point cut
[00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:56.660]   was contradictory in the sense
[00:15:56.660 --> 00:16:01.660]   that the only two times in recent history
[00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:04.860]   where the Fed began a rate-cutting cycle
[00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:08.740]   with a 50 basis point cut was in 2001 and 2008,
[00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:12.100]   which were on the verge of pretty big recessions.
[00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:16.500]   And so the Fed felt like it needed to cut dramatically
[00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:20.060]   in order to help stave off those recessions.
[00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:21.860]   But that was not Powell's rhetoric.
[00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:24.580]   What Powell said is the economy was doing very well.
[00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:26.060]   So what I said a month ago was,
[00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:27.140]   if the economy's doing really well,
[00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:30.220]   why wouldn't you just tiptoe into the rate-cutting cycle
[00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:32.620]   with, say, a 25 basis point cut
[00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:34.660]   and then see how the market absorbs it
[00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:37.380]   and get another month's inflation data?
[00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:39.300]   Well, we've gotten another month of inflation data,
[00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:42.740]   and it's showing that, these are not huge moves,
[00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:45.580]   but it's showing that inflation in,
[00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:48.500]   was it core CPI was just a little bit higher than expected.
[00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:50.300]   So again, the market is concerned
[00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:52.500]   that inflation is not whipped,
[00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:55.020]   that the Fed may have been overly precipitous
[00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:57.220]   in how it cut rates.
[00:16:57.220 --> 00:16:59.460]   And then the other thing is they just do not like
[00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:01.180]   the long-term fiscal picture of the US.
[00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:03.060]   One other chart we should bring up
[00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:05.220]   is interest on the national debt.
[00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:07.460]   What you can see here is that it has gone
[00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:10.860]   absolutely parabolic in the last couple of years.
[00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:12.100]   Our interest on the debt's something like what,
[00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:14.660]   like 1.3, 1.4 trillion a year?
[00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:16.540]   - 1.35 trillion run rate, yep.
[00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:20.460]   - $3,500 per American, per year.
[00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:23.940]   - And it's something like 20 to 25% of federal revenue now
[00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:25.980]   is going to debt service.
[00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:27.300]   And this continues to increase.
[00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:30.020]   Now, I think there was an expectation
[00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:32.460]   that we'd be able to get this line to go back down
[00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:34.340]   once we had rate cuts, right?
[00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:36.140]   Because if inflation's licked
[00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:38.580]   and the Fed can lower interest rates again
[00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:42.500]   and we can get back to a 2% 10-year bond,
[00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:44.620]   which is where we were a few years ago,
[00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:46.900]   then all of a sudden that national debt service
[00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:48.660]   becomes a little bit more reasonable, right?
[00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:52.460]   I mean, you could service that debt at half the cost.
[00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:55.540]   But now it looks like that may not happen.
[00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:57.780]   So just to wrap this up,
[00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:00.060]   I just think that the market doesn't like
[00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:02.620]   these fundamentals of the US fiscal picture.
[00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:06.580]   You've got rapidly increasing debt service costs.
[00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:09.300]   You've got an inflation picture that is murky
[00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:11.420]   and may not be going away.
[00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:14.100]   And the bond markets are starting to price in
[00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:16.260]   higher interest rates for longer.
[00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:19.260]   And this is why Paul Tudor Jones is saying,
[00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:20.380]   "All roads lead to inflation."
[00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:23.700]   And this is why Druckenmiller is shorting US treasuries.
[00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:27.180]   - J. Cal, do you think either party
[00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:31.220]   or either candidate in this presidential election
[00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:32.940]   is gonna drive a different outcome
[00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:34.060]   in terms of federal spending
[00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:38.740]   and the long-term impact on deficit and as a result rates?
[00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:42.620]   - Well, if we look at previous performance
[00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:45.020]   as an indicator of future success,
[00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:48.900]   the answer is no, they're not going to cut spending.
[00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:52.260]   Most of the reports out say they're gonna spend
[00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:54.260]   another 10 trillion in the next administration
[00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:56.140]   independent of who you vote for.
[00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:58.500]   And I think that's actually what you have to think about
[00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:01.380]   here is where does all that money wind up, right?
[00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:03.620]   It's certainly not gonna trickle down.
[00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:05.380]   And what's probably gonna happen
[00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:07.700]   is it's gonna find its way into equities.
[00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:09.620]   And that's why these equities are so high
[00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:12.740]   is because people are recognizing correctly
[00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:15.980]   that if we do spend another 10 trillion
[00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:18.100]   and go another 10 trillion into debt,
[00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:19.300]   that money winds up somewhere.
[00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:20.420]   Where does it wind up?
[00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:24.180]   Government salaries, contracts.
[00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:27.620]   And if we get a tax cut as well, that's going to goose.
[00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:29.940]   And I think one party will do a tax cut
[00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:31.780]   and spend eight, nine, 10 trillion.
[00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:33.140]   The other party will spend 10 trillion
[00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:34.900]   and maybe raise taxes a little bit.
[00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:37.300]   It's gonna net that into the same place.
[00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:40.220]   And then I think what we'll see on top of that
[00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:45.220]   is what I think could be cataclysmic contraction
[00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:49.180]   in white collar employment in the United States
[00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:52.580]   over the next four to 10 years next to administrations.
[00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:54.500]   And that's gonna exacerbate this problem
[00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:57.140]   and create, I think, some social tension
[00:19:57.140 --> 00:20:00.020]   because we've had record low unemployment.
[00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:01.700]   And so even though people feel bad
[00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:03.300]   about the economy generally,
[00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:05.860]   and some of that is related to which parties,
[00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:08.020]   which party you're a part of
[00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:10.740]   and how you perceive the economy and all this data.
[00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:13.300]   But just brass tacks, we had the lowest unemployment
[00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:16.340]   of our lifetime for the past five, 10 years.
[00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:17.940]   And it's been absolutely fabulous.
[00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:19.140]   The salaries have gone up.
[00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:23.300]   And this is going to result in, I think,
[00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:26.420]   a little bit of austerity measures coming at some point.
[00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:28.100]   It probably won't come in this next administration,
[00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:29.860]   but certainly the one after that
[00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:31.780]   is gonna have to do some belt tightening.
[00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:33.540]   And we're gonna have to address this issue
[00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:36.340]   because spending, everybody in America
[00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:40.340]   having to pay their share of that interest alone is $3,500.
[00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:42.020]   I mean, let that sink in.
[00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:44.980]   You're gonna spend, for every member of your family,
[00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:46.740]   $3,500 a year in interest.
[00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:47.780]   That's your part of it.
[00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:49.460]   Take the 1.3 trillion.
[00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:51.460]   It's just a lot of money.
[00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:53.460]   And if that is the case,
[00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:58.500]   it's gonna create a massive bubble in equities again.
[00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:00.740]   And then if you look inside of the big companies,
[00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:05.460]   three or four years ago, Uber, Airbnb, Google,
[00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:07.300]   and Facebook had more employees
[00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:09.860]   or the same number of employees they have now while growing.
[00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:12.580]   Those companies are all growing 20% year over year.
[00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:15.380]   So the earnings and the top line
[00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:17.220]   of these companies continue to grow
[00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:18.980]   while they have a static team size.
[00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:21.060]   This is like an extraordinary thing we haven't seen.
[00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:23.860]   So the two pieces here that we haven't seen before
[00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:25.780]   is what happens when you put another,
[00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:29.700]   I don't know, $20 trillion of debt into the US economy.
[00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:34.260]   And what happens when companies, the big ones, stop hiring
[00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:36.420]   and they just become wildly efficient
[00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:38.420]   and become wildly profitable.
[00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:42.340]   And this will be a renters, rentiers, you know,
[00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:45.780]   story where people who have equities
[00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:48.100]   and people who own property are gonna do fabulous
[00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:49.380]   over the next five to 10 years.
[00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:52.100]   And then the 40%, 50% of people who don't
[00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:54.980]   are gonna really be feeling a pinch.
[00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:57.620]   - Well, it does depend also on how levered they are.
[00:21:57.620 --> 00:21:59.220]   So just to give you guys a sense,
[00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:02.180]   total US household, corporate, and government debt,
[00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:03.860]   which includes state and local and federal.
[00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:06.820]   So household debt in the US is about 18 trillion.
[00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:09.140]   Corporate debt's about 11 trillion.
[00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:11.540]   State and local government debt's 3 trillion.
[00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:13.540]   Obviously the federal debt, 36 trillion.
[00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:16.820]   That adds up to a whopping $68 trillion
[00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:19.540]   of total debt across the US.
[00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:23.380]   Which if you assume a 6% average interest rate,
[00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:25.220]   you know, you got corporate debt and household debt,
[00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:27.220]   so it's a little more risky, so it carries a higher rate.
[00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:31.060]   That means we're spending about $4 trillion a year
[00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:34.820]   of an economy that's only 29 trillion a year
[00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:37.780]   to service the debt, just to pay the interest on the debt.
[00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:40.420]   So 15% of every dollar that trades hands
[00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:42.900]   is going towards interest payments
[00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:44.580]   on existing leverage, on existing debt.
[00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:46.580]   It's a highly levered system.
[00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:47.700]   And if you look around the world,
[00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:49.620]   this problem is not just a US challenge.
[00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:51.460]   Global leverage is a problem
[00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:54.900]   that's now becoming a crisis for countries everywhere.
[00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:57.380]   The UK is waiting on a big budget proposal this week.
[00:22:57.380 --> 00:22:59.060]   Higher taxes is what's going to be in there
[00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:00.340]   to make up for a budget deficit,
[00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:03.780]   which is currently 4.4% of GDP.
[00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:07.140]   The UK economy is only growing at 0.9% a year.
[00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:09.860]   France has a major budget crisis underway right now.
[00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:11.540]   They're struggling to reduce their deficit
[00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:14.180]   from 6% down to 5% of GDP.
[00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:16.260]   And they've got skyrocketing bankruptcies.
[00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:19.940]   74% of people that can work in that country are working.
[00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:22.660]   And that's because of large social programs
[00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:23.700]   that support the balance.
[00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:25.700]   7.3% technical unemployment.
[00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:30.260]   And they're raising taxes on 440 firms,
[00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:31.860]   440 companies in the country
[00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:33.140]   that make a billion or more in revenue
[00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:34.580]   with a "temporary tax."
[00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:38.100]   There's a 4% surcharge on income over 500K
[00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:39.140]   that's going into effect,
[00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:41.620]   second home real estate taxes, and so on.
[00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:42.980]   France is struggling to figure out a way
[00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:45.780]   to generate revenue to make up for the shortfall.
[00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:47.780]   In Brazil, there's a major budget crisis.
[00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:51.220]   States owe $130 billion to the federal government there.
[00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:53.140]   Inflation is accelerating at 4.6%.
[00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:55.700]   Rates are going to go higher and longer,
[00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:57.700]   complicating other economic growth opportunities
[00:23:57.700 --> 00:23:58.260]   in the country.
[00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:02.660]   So this is becoming kind of a global leverage problem,
[00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:04.740]   which might explain the flight to safety
[00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:07.220]   in assets like gold and Bitcoin.
[00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:10.740]   And it's going to present a lot of real struggles
[00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:12.020]   for every global economy.
[00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:13.940]   Now, the question is,
[00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:16.500]   does the U.S. dollar maintain its reserve status?
[00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:19.220]   Because ultimately, I think it is inevitable
[00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:21.300]   that the Federal Reserve in the United States
[00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:23.300]   is going to need to buy the debt.
[00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:25.220]   They're going to need to monetize the debt,
[00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:26.420]   which means printing money.
[00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:28.260]   There is no one else to buy the debt.
[00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:30.020]   So pull up the China chart, Nick.
[00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:31.780]   China's historically been the biggest buyer
[00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:32.980]   and owner of U.S. treasuries.
[00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:35.460]   But here's what's happened in the last couple of years.
[00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:38.580]   It peaked at about $1.3 trillion about 10 years ago.
[00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:42.020]   And then recently, particularly starting around COVID,
[00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:43.140]   they began selling down
[00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:45.300]   and have been selling down at an accelerated pace.
[00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:48.580]   Today, China is back to the level they were at
[00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:50.420]   nearly 15 years ago,
[00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:51.860]   in terms of their treasury holdings.
[00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:53.620]   And they have publicly declared
[00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:55.220]   that they are selling off U.S. treasuries
[00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:57.060]   and buying gold instead.
[00:24:57.060 --> 00:25:00.180]   So the biggest buyer of U.S. treasuries
[00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:01.540]   has kind of left the market
[00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:02.580]   or is leaving the market.
[00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:04.660]   Who does that leave?
[00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:05.620]   Well, at the end of the day,
[00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:07.220]   the Federal Reserve has been
[00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:08.900]   the kind of buyer of last resort.
[00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:11.460]   And if they end up buying treasuries,
[00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:12.580]   that's where we have a problem
[00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:14.820]   with too many dollars and inflation kicking up.
[00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:17.700]   And so it feels like a lot of the trades in assets
[00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:21.940]   are what's going to benefit from the inflation.
[00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:23.220]   And it's going to be gold.
[00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:24.180]   It's going to be Bitcoin.
[00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:25.780]   And in some cases,
[00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:27.380]   because you're pumping more money in the system,
[00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:28.500]   it's going to be equities.
[00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:30.740]   And that might explain why
[00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:31.940]   equities are moving up as well.
[00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:34.260]   Where do you guys invest here?
[00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:35.060]   I mean, Chamath,
[00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:38.180]   do you care about how the market's positioned
[00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:41.060]   or how you're positioned in this election right now?
[00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:43.220]   And based on how we're seeing markets trade
[00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:45.300]   and what these kind of macro indicators are telling us,
[00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:47.060]   are you just business as usual,
[00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:50.180]   heads down, invest and build as you always have?
[00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:53.300]   Yeah, I think that you can't trade these things.
[00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:56.660]   And any attempt to do it
[00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:58.500]   is probably a level of false precision
[00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:00.340]   where you're going to lose more money.
[00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:01.540]   And there's a lot of slippage
[00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:03.060]   and even just trying to execute it.
[00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:04.500]   I mean, at the beginning of the year,
[00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:08.260]   I said the breakout asset was going to be Bitcoin.
[00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:11.700]   I think it looks like it's going to be
[00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:14.340]   the resounding inflation hedge asset
[00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:15.940]   for the next 50 or 100 years.
[00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:18.980]   So that die has been cast.
[00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:21.460]   I think you're seeing the last vestiges
[00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:22.900]   of people using gold
[00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:27.380]   as a rational economic insurance policy.
[00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:29.540]   But I think the future
[00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:33.220]   is specifically Bitcoin on that dimension.
[00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:35.860]   So I guess you could trade that,
[00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:36.980]   you could speculate on that.
[00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:40.180]   I think the question that I've been grappling with is,
[00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:41.780]   in my scenarios,
[00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:43.460]   what happens if Kamal Harris wins?
[00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:44.580]   What do the markets do?
[00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:46.500]   And I actually think it would
[00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:48.340]   reverse a lot of these trends
[00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:49.780]   over the last month and a half.
[00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:50.900]   Like I said, I really do think
[00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:52.260]   that there's a repositioning,
[00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:53.540]   rebalance component to everything
[00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:54.500]   that's happening right now.
[00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:57.060]   So I don't think there's much to do,
[00:26:57.060 --> 00:26:59.940]   unless you have a very specific bet
[00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:00.740]   that you want to make.
[00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:03.700]   That would just keep my head down and keep building.
[00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:05.380]   Are you in the same place, Axe?
[00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:07.700]   Are you, Jekyll, are you guys trading at all?
[00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:09.620]   I mean, I think trading is a mistake.
[00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:11.140]   Time in market is better
[00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:12.420]   than trying to time the market.
[00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:13.540]   And as I said before,
[00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:15.060]   where is all this money going to flow,
[00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:15.860]   all this spending?
[00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:17.060]   But asset class, right?
[00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:18.660]   I mean, that's the key question, right?
[00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:20.740]   Like, do you change what assets you own?
[00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:21.860]   I don't think so.
[00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:25.060]   And I do think there's another thing
[00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:27.540]   that's worth sort of unpacking here.
[00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:30.580]   Because when you do see people feel
[00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:33.300]   like the economy is working against them,
[00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:35.460]   all kinds of interesting movements start,
[00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:36.900]   cultural movements, et cetera.
[00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:38.420]   And I think that's what we're seeing
[00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:40.020]   in this election is people who believe
[00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:41.540]   in capitalism and free markets
[00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:42.340]   and people who don't,
[00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:43.540]   people who believe in free speech,
[00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:44.260]   people who don't,
[00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:48.100]   people who see themselves as victims,
[00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:49.940]   and then other people who see them as creators.
[00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:53.140]   And I really study a lot of like,
[00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:54.500]   what young people are doing.
[00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:56.340]   And I don't know if you guys are watching
[00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:58.180]   sort of the anti-work movement
[00:27:58.180 --> 00:27:59.780]   or the fire movement,
[00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:02.580]   which is financial independence, retire early.
[00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:03.940]   A lot of young people now
[00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:07.700]   are looking at financial markets,
[00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:09.860]   whether it's Robinhood or Coinbase
[00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:11.540]   or price picks,
[00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:12.900]   whatever market it is,
[00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:14.340]   young men, especially.
[00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:14.980]   And they're saying,
[00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:16.420]   I need to control my destiny.
[00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:17.380]   I need to,
[00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:19.220]   this capitalism is not working for me.
[00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:20.260]   I need to own equities.
[00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:21.780]   I need to make trades.
[00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:24.420]   And I need to retire early
[00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:25.540]   and have experiences
[00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:26.660]   because the capitalist system
[00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:27.860]   is broken to some extent.
[00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:29.300]   And then there's another group of people
[00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:30.580]   who are just anti-work.
[00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:31.540]   And there was this term
[00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:33.940]   back in the day called NEET,
[00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:35.220]   not employed,
[00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:37.300]   not being educated
[00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:38.420]   and not in training.
[00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:39.860]   Basically the people
[00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:41.860]   who are called the unproductives.
[00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:43.300]   And if you look at the peak
[00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:45.140]   engagement and employment
[00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:45.860]   in our country,
[00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:48.100]   and Japan has similar trends,
[00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:49.220]   although they are probably
[00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:50.020]   10 years ahead of us.
[00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:51.860]   - Sounds anything but NEET.
[00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:53.300]   - Yeah, it's not NEET.
[00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:54.660]   - Sounds terrible.
[00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:58.260]   - But we peaked at 68, 69% labor participation.
[00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:00.260]   And we're 10% off that, maybe more.
[00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:02.340]   We were at 61 or 62.
[00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:03.140]   I think a lot of people
[00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:03.860]   are gonna give up
[00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:04.660]   because the debt
[00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:05.780]   is gonna be so crushing
[00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:07.140]   that the logical thing to do,
[00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:07.700]   if you don't think
[00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:09.140]   you can get out from under it,
[00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:10.340]   might be to move in with your parents
[00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:11.460]   or two or three other people,
[00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:12.820]   tighten your belts and enjoy life
[00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:13.380]   and go skiing
[00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:15.860]   and go have experiences.
[00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:16.900]   And a lot of young people
[00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:17.860]   are electing to do that.
[00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:18.340]   In other words,
[00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:19.940]   they're opting out of the American dream.
[00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:21.300]   - Sorry, to your point,
[00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:23.220]   the one thing that I realized
[00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:24.660]   with a lot of young men
[00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:26.020]   that Jason,
[00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:27.460]   I think you're really hitting
[00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:28.260]   the nail on the head
[00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:29.780]   is a lot of them now
[00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:31.700]   do not view the job that they do
[00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:34.900]   as their only path
[00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:36.820]   to economic independence.
[00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:37.780]   And if anything,
[00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:40.180]   they may do a job,
[00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:41.860]   but then they're actively trading
[00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:43.220]   on the side,
[00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:46.980]   something, crypto, options, whatever.
[00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:47.940]   They're on Robinhood.
[00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:48.900]   They're using Coinbase
[00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:50.580]   because it's almost like
[00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:52.180]   they've separated in their mind
[00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:53.140]   that the job they do
[00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:53.940]   will never give them
[00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:55.620]   the financial independence they want.
[00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:56.420]   And so instead,
[00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:58.020]   they're gonna do that job
[00:29:58.020 --> 00:29:58.820]   because they like it.
[00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:01.140]   Hopefully they love it.
[00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:01.860]   But then separately,
[00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:03.060]   they're gonna go and speculate
[00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:04.020]   to try to make money.
[00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:05.300]   It's a really interesting thing
[00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:06.980]   because I had always been taught
[00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:07.940]   you earn your wealth
[00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:09.060]   through the job you have.
[00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:10.580]   And so if you wanted to make more money,
[00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:11.460]   you have to ladder up
[00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:12.500]   and do something different.
[00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:14.900]   Yeah, I think that that's not true.
[00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:16.660]   That idea has been sort of decoupled now.
[00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:18.100]   That's a really interesting change
[00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:19.300]   in how people approach work.
[00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:21.700]   - I call them gen bet.
[00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:22.820]   Like they're the generation
[00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:23.620]   that believes on,
[00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:24.740]   there's just like subset of them.
[00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:25.860]   It's not all of them.
[00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:28.020]   A number of them are just quiet quitting
[00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:29.620]   and they just don't believe in capitalism.
[00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:30.420]   And then there's this other group,
[00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:32.340]   which are like trying to get control.
[00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:33.860]   I call them gen bet
[00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:35.700]   'cause they just want to bet on themselves.
[00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:38.500]   And if they don't get wrecked
[00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:40.100]   by the financial markets,
[00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:40.980]   trading options,
[00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:42.780]   and doing price picks.
[00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:44.340]   - Sorry, the other thing I'll say
[00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:46.420]   just in recruiting a bunch of people
[00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:49.780]   at 80, 90 over the last three or four months
[00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:51.460]   is there is an enormous difference
[00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:53.140]   that I have seen psychologically
[00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:55.700]   in the people that are 25 and older
[00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:59.220]   versus the people that are 25 and under.
[00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:01.540]   And I'm calling 25 as a rough number,
[00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:02.980]   but there are kids
[00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:05.540]   that are 18, 19, 20, 21 years old
[00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:09.060]   that are off the charts good.
[00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:11.300]   They're motivated, they're hungry.
[00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:12.820]   They're like, let's get after it.
[00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:15.380]   And they are honestly different
[00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:17.380]   in the way they approach their job
[00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:18.820]   than folks that are in their late 20s
[00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:19.460]   and early 30s.
[00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:21.380]   - I think they're the first generation
[00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:23.300]   who didn't go into debt in college
[00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:24.740]   and didn't buy into that.
[00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:25.780]   Like, so they might,
[00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:27.140]   the millennials ahead of them
[00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:29.140]   might have like taken the bullets
[00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:31.540]   - Yeah, the folks that are in their late 20s,
[00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:32.100]   early 30s,
[00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:34.820]   and I'm not trying to generalize or disparage,
[00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:36.740]   but they lack a level of motivation.
[00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:38.500]   Again, generally speaking,
[00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:41.460]   that the youngest folks in the workforce have.
[00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:43.060]   And that also that people
[00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:44.580]   in our generation sort of have.
[00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:46.580]   So they're sort of sandwiched in between
[00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:49.380]   a very different way of approaching work.
[00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:51.860]   And as a result, they stand out.
[00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:53.220]   And I don't think they're standing out
[00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:54.180]   for all the right reasons.
[00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:58.580]   - Well, the majority now of young people
[00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:00.580]   the number I believe,
[00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:02.020]   and Nick, if you could pull this up,
[00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:06.740]   57% of Gen Zers want to be influencers
[00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:09.140]   as their primary career now.
[00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:12.180]   That the idea of working a job
[00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:14.580]   is almost like a secondary option.
[00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:17.460]   The primary option that everyone would strive for
[00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:20.660]   is to be an influencer.
[00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:24.260]   And this number has grown considerably,
[00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:25.380]   continues to grow.
[00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:27.780]   And in fact, if you look at the rest of this report,
[00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:28.740]   this was out of a mining console.
[00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:34.100]   - Did you say 50% of Gen Zers aspire to be influencers?
[00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:36.500]   - Correct, 57%.
[00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:38.420]   - As their career,
[00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:39.940]   or just they want to be influential
[00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:42.020]   and build a brand around themselves, I wonder.
[00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:44.100]   - That's what they want to do for a living.
[00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:44.900]   That's what they would like to do.
[00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:46.660]   - That's what they want their paycheck to be, interesting.
[00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:47.700]   - That's what they want their paycheck to be.
[00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:48.900]   - They want to be independent.
[00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:50.180]   And I don't think they believe this.
[00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:52.020]   They believe the system's rigged against them.
[00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:52.820]   And why wouldn't you think
[00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:53.940]   the system's rigged against you
[00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:56.740]   if you went 150 or 250K in debt
[00:32:56.740 --> 00:32:57.940]   and you couldn't get a good job?
[00:32:57.940 --> 00:33:00.260]   - Sax, as a successful influencer,
[00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:03.140]   how would you advise the youth on their career choices?
[00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:04.820]   - I'll put it.
[00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:06.820]   - Yeah, look, I think that
[00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:08.420]   believing you're going to be an influencer
[00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:10.020]   is like believing that you're going to be
[00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:14.020]   like a rock star or movie actor or something like that.
[00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:14.820]   - Pro-athlete, yeah.
[00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:15.860]   - Pro-athlete, yeah.
[00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:17.300]   It's like a one in a million shot.
[00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:20.820]   It's just not a great thing
[00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:22.980]   to want to design your career around
[00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:26.340]   because it's just very unlikely to happen.
[00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:29.460]   So I think you're better off finding a career
[00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:30.740]   that you're passionate about,
[00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:32.500]   but where you're actually adding value.
[00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:34.660]   The world doesn't need 50 something percent
[00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:37.060]   of the population to become influencers.
[00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:38.100]   That's kind of crazy.
[00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:40.100]   It reminds me of a line from "Fight Club"
[00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:42.500]   where Tyler Durden says,
[00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:43.940]   "We've all been raised on television
[00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:46.020]   to believe that one day we'd all be millionaires
[00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:48.980]   and movie gods and rock stars, but we won't."
[00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:50.660]   And we're slowly learning that fact.
[00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:52.260]   And we're very, very pissed off.
[00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:53.700]   - And that was Gen X.
[00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:55.060]   - That was Gen X, yeah.
[00:33:55.060 --> 00:34:00.580]   So they're headed for a Fight Club-like realization
[00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:01.060]   about this.
[00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:03.060]   - Sax, how do you advise a young person
[00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:06.980]   on, there's this temptation to go
[00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:08.660]   and spend all this time making content
[00:34:08.660 --> 00:34:09.940]   and pursue that as your career
[00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:11.620]   and that's a life opportunity for you now.
[00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:13.460]   It's more free and open, they would think,
[00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:16.100]   than perhaps being a movie star
[00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:17.700]   or a basketball player used to be.
[00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:20.900]   - So I think it's just important to recognize
[00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:23.060]   that if we ourselves are influencers,
[00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:25.620]   the reason why we're not being hypocritical
[00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:27.940]   is that none of us here,
[00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:29.380]   with the possible exception of J. Cal,
[00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:30.900]   ever set out to be influencers, right?
[00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:33.140]   We did something different.
[00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:34.180]   We actually had a career
[00:34:34.180 --> 00:34:36.260]   and we did something interesting.
[00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:37.460]   And then as a result of that,
[00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:39.460]   maybe people wanna listen to our pod.
[00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:41.540]   The idea that you can just go be an influencer
[00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:44.580]   without having actually done anything interesting,
[00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:46.180]   what's your credential for that?
[00:34:46.180 --> 00:34:47.940]   So what I would advise
[00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:50.340]   is just people should go do something productive.
[00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:53.460]   And then if it leads to other people
[00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:55.300]   wanting to hear from them,
[00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:56.500]   then that's good.
[00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:59.060]   But setting out to be someone
[00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:00.260]   that other people should listen to
[00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:02.580]   without having any experience
[00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:04.260]   or having done anything productive in your life,
[00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:05.540]   it's like, why should we listen to you?
[00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:07.700]   - Yeah, one thing, I did build and sell
[00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:09.700]   two out of my three businesses over the years,
[00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:12.820]   but there are tens of millions of people
[00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:15.620]   making money in the long tail as a content creator
[00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:17.220]   and it's low thousands of dollars
[00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:18.340]   in some cases per month.
[00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:20.420]   But if you combine that with people
[00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:22.260]   who are gig economy workers
[00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:23.620]   and they don't believe in the system
[00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:25.700]   because they worked really hard,
[00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:27.300]   they got this job at Google,
[00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:28.820]   they went to the office,
[00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:30.740]   then they got laid off and nobody cares about them.
[00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:32.260]   Now they're getting dragged back into the office.
[00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:33.700]   They still have these payments.
[00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:35.540]   And then they look at this other system where,
[00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:37.380]   hey, they started to get 10,000 followers.
[00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:39.300]   They started to make $1,000 a month
[00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:41.060]   and $3,000 a month.
[00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:42.100]   They actually see a path
[00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:45.780]   to being independent of a system
[00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:47.140]   that has no loyalty to me.
[00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:48.420]   And that's what I hear from folks.
[00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:49.700]   And I think it's great.
[00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:51.380]   If we're not going to be loyal
[00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:53.460]   as like corporations to individuals,
[00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:56.980]   those individuals are now responding
[00:35:56.980 --> 00:35:59.140]   and the antidote to that poison
[00:35:59.140 --> 00:36:00.820]   of just being laid off randomly
[00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:02.100]   or being dragged back to the office
[00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:03.380]   after you told you to work from home,
[00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:04.020]   all that stuff,
[00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:06.180]   they now believe,
[00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:07.940]   hey, I can be independent
[00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:10.660]   and then you have to fight to get my services.
[00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:12.260]   And I think that's what this is about.
[00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:15.140]   If we're going to talk about Starbucks later,
[00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:16.580]   and I think that's a big part
[00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:17.860]   of the Starbucks problem,
[00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:20.500]   having a side hustle makes you anti-fragile.
[00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:22.900]   You have other sources of income
[00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:24.980]   and you can tell your boss to F off.
[00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:26.420]   And that's what young people are doing.
[00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:27.300]   I've seen it.
[00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:28.820]   I've seen people just quit jobs
[00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:29.780]   and just say, you know what?
[00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:31.460]   I've got other ways to make money
[00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:32.900]   and I don't have a big burn rate.
[00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:35.140]   And so that's smart for young people to do that.
[00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:36.580]   And I think my advice would be
[00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:37.460]   to build your brand,
[00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:39.140]   be as independent as possible
[00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:40.500]   and to make things in the world
[00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:42.100]   and show people what you mean.
[00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:43.220]   That's the best thing you can do.
[00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:45.140]   - Can I give you the other side of this
[00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:46.500]   before we go back to macro?
[00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:47.140]   - Yeah.
[00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:49.140]   - Imagine that Tom Brady,
[00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:51.860]   who really respected Bill Belichick,
[00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:54.740]   but I wouldn't say is super fond of him.
[00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:55.780]   They're not super close,
[00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:58.580]   but imagine that Tom Brady had a side hustle
[00:36:58.580 --> 00:37:01.940]   and let's just say he drove an Uber
[00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:03.620]   and he made enough money
[00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:04.820]   where when things got hard
[00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:06.740]   and he didn't get enough playing time,
[00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:07.460]   he opted out.
[00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:09.380]   Would that have made Brady the person he was?
[00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:11.140]   I think the answer is no.
[00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:13.540]   I think there are a lot of people
[00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:14.580]   who started companies
[00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:17.300]   after being in very difficult
[00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:18.500]   and challenging environments
[00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:21.060]   that stretched and pushed them
[00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:22.580]   beyond their comfort zone
[00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:24.820]   and they lived in that world for years
[00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:25.940]   before they started something.
[00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:30.420]   If all of a sudden the answer is
[00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:32.260]   let me have an escape hatch
[00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:34.100]   so that I can egress off
[00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:35.380]   whenever things get hard,
[00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:37.140]   I don't think you're going to accomplish
[00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:38.020]   much of anything
[00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:39.700]   because I'm not sure that that is
[00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:42.420]   the kind of boundary conditions
[00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:44.580]   that push greatness upon people.
[00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:46.420]   So I would just keep that in mind as well.
[00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:48.660]   I'm not sure the side hustle solves anything.
[00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:50.340]   It may actually allow you to quit
[00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:51.860]   before you actually get
[00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:52.900]   to the other side of something
[00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:54.260]   and realize what you're capable of.
[00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:57.300]   Yeah, I think that's a great point.
[00:37:57.300 --> 00:37:59.140]   You kind of have to mentally burn the boats
[00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:00.500]   when you do a startup.
[00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:01.220]   It's Cortez.
[00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:02.580]   You got to burn the boats.
[00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:03.460]   Yeah, I agree with that.
[00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:06.420]   Your life needs to be like Cortez.
[00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:07.620]   You got to burn the boats.
[00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:10.580]   If you keep the safety net with you
[00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:12.820]   as you move through life all the time
[00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:14.420]   and you never put yourself at risk,
[00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:16.260]   you're never going to figure out
[00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:17.220]   what you're capable of.
[00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:19.700]   And then you're going to look back at some point
[00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:21.860]   and the odds that you're going to be disappointed
[00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:24.420]   are higher than if you actually just tried
[00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:25.860]   and lived it and just said,
[00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:26.500]   "Okay, you know what?
[00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:28.420]   I'm really glad I'm betting on myself here."
[00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:30.500]   To wrap up the conversation
[00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:31.940]   about where markets are headed,
[00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:33.620]   Sax, I think we were going to just do
[00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:34.420]   a quick round the horn.
[00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:35.780]   Anything that you've repositioned
[00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:37.780]   in your portfolio around investing
[00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:39.380]   or asset classes that you shift
[00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:43.620]   as we face looming budget crises,
[00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:45.940]   the election cycle?
[00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:48.900]   I'm trying to sell every single SaaS startup
[00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:50.340]   I have in secondary markets.
[00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:52.660]   And you know how many bids there are
[00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:54.100]   for these SaaS companies?
[00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:55.060]   Negative one bid.
[00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:56.980]   That's interesting.
[00:38:56.980 --> 00:39:00.980]   I had a couple of my startups get offers.
[00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:03.060]   I've had three or four secondary offers
[00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:03.860]   in the last two weeks
[00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:05.460]   I've had to deeply consider
[00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:06.900]   and they weren't like 75.
[00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:08.180]   What kind of companies?
[00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:10.260]   Let's say two are SaaS
[00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:11.300]   and then one I can't say
[00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:12.420]   because it would be too easy to guess.
[00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:14.420]   But the bottom feeders went from offering
[00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:15.860]   like an 80% discount
[00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:17.540]   to now a 25% discount.
[00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:18.420]   So you know you're not allowed
[00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:20.900]   to sell your shares in all in, right?
[00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:21.540]   I'm trying.
[00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:22.100]   I'm trying.
[00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:24.100]   Brad Gerstner's bought 7% so far.
[00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:27.140]   So I'm quickly offloading to Gerstner
[00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:27.780]   as much as I can.
[00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:30.740]   You just super tilted Friberg there.
[00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:31.700]   Look at him, he's laughing
[00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:33.780]   but inside he's just about to explode.
[00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:34.900]   You're going to have the fifth best guy here.
[00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:36.260]   He's going to own 7%.
[00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:37.620]   He gets 16 minutes per episode.
[00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:38.340]   You know what?
[00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:39.700]   If he'll moderate, I'll have him.
[00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:42.020]   I mean, this is moderation going OK
[00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:43.620]   or should I jump in and save the show?
[00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:45.540]   He should write all in a get fit memo.
[00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:48.020]   Just on the question of
[00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:48.900]   how do you reposition?
[00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:50.980]   So first of all, the easy one to avoid
[00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:52.340]   is treasuries, right?
[00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:53.700]   I mean, do you really want to accept
[00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:56.820]   a 4.2% yield for 10 years
[00:39:56.820 --> 00:39:59.780]   to own a US bond
[00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:02.740]   and with the looming inflation
[00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:04.100]   that is still out there
[00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:05.620]   or the looming debt crisis
[00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:06.740]   that might be out there?
[00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:08.340]   So that's probably the easy one.
[00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:10.820]   I think the hard one is around equities
[00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:12.900]   because equities are at an all-time high.
[00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:15.540]   Part of the reason why they're an all-time high
[00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:17.620]   is because the Fed telegraphed
[00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:19.300]   that we'd have big rate cuts this year.
[00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:21.540]   Remember at the beginning of this year,
[00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:22.980]   they said there would be seven rate cuts.
[00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:26.100]   Those expectations have kept coming down.
[00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:27.300]   I think we had one,
[00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:29.860]   I guess we had a double rate cut last month
[00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:30.580]   and we were supposed to have
[00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:32.820]   one more 50-bit rate cut this year.
[00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:34.500]   I have to wonder if that's still going to happen.
[00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:36.660]   And more to the point,
[00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:39.060]   if you believe Druckenmiller and Paul Tudor Jones,
[00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:42.260]   we might be in for a extended period
[00:40:42.260 --> 00:40:45.780]   of higher interest rates for longer
[00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:47.380]   and that will be bad for equities.
[00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:50.420]   Equities normally are inflation protected
[00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:51.540]   in the sense that those companies
[00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:52.740]   can just raise prices over time
[00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:53.700]   and keep up with inflation.
[00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:55.940]   And so equities are generally
[00:40:55.940 --> 00:40:57.460]   a pretty good thing to own
[00:40:57.460 --> 00:40:59.780]   in the face of inflation.
[00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:02.180]   But if we're in for a period
[00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:03.300]   of high interest rates
[00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:04.980]   longer than anyone thinks,
[00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:06.340]   that's going to be bad for equities.
[00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:07.620]   Well, I would just argue one thing,
[00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:10.420]   which is except in the scenario
[00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:12.660]   where you believe the only inevitable path
[00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:15.700]   is for the central banks to monetize the debt,
[00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:18.020]   meaning the central banks step in
[00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:19.700]   to buy the outstanding treasuries
[00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:21.060]   that need to be issued,
[00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:22.900]   which both supports inflation,
[00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:25.220]   but also introduces capital into the system.
[00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:26.980]   And that's where both equities,
[00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:28.020]   that's where you could see a scenario
[00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:29.620]   where equities and gold go up
[00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:33.060]   while fixed income goes down to have higher rates.
[00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:36.340]   So it's effectively a money printing indicator or signal.
[00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:38.500]   Now, my personal position on this
[00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:40.820]   going into this new era,
[00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:43.700]   if it manifests as the markets are telling us it will,
[00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:46.260]   is kind of where Paul Tudor Jones is.
[00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:47.700]   I think that commodities have,
[00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:49.300]   and gold is a commodity.
[00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:52.500]   Everyone talks about it as being the safe haven asset,
[00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:54.420]   but there are other commodities out there
[00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:56.260]   that are much more fungible
[00:41:56.260 --> 00:41:58.260]   and used in production cycles
[00:41:58.260 --> 00:42:01.220]   to make food, to make energy, to make goods.
[00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:04.180]   And a commodity-linked businesses,
[00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:06.900]   meaning businesses whose revenue or profit grows
[00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:09.060]   with the underlying commodity price growing,
[00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:10.420]   will outperform other businesses.
[00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:11.780]   They're going to struggle to raise prices
[00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:14.020]   or struggle to pay higher labor costs
[00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:17.140]   or struggle to deal with higher cogs.
[00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:18.580]   Whereas commodity-linked businesses
[00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:20.180]   that effectively just make a margin on the commodity--
[00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:20.900]   - What's an example?
[00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:23.300]   - A mining business.
[00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:27.300]   So businesses that do mining of natural resources,
[00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:30.820]   businesses that trade agricultural commodities.
[00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:32.980]   So those businesses usually make kind of a fixed margin
[00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:34.260]   on the underlying commodity price,
[00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:36.820]   and they do well in these cycles.
[00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:39.220]   So anyway, I think that Paul Tudor Jones--
[00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:40.100]   'Cause if you own a commodity,
[00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:41.060]   it's not a productive asset.
[00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:42.580]   It's not generating yield for you.
[00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:44.580]   But if you own a business that's making a profit--
[00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:47.140]   - It just seems like it's easier to own Bitcoin.
[00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:48.820]   - That's one asset,
[00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:50.740]   but Bitcoin isn't a productive asset, right?
[00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:53.780]   I mean, so that's one way to kind of build a portfolio.
[00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:55.700]   But I personally like owning businesses
[00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:57.380]   where they're doing something and making value,
[00:42:57.380 --> 00:42:59.060]   and in the process, they earn a profit,
[00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:00.420]   especially if the profit grows
[00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:03.300]   with an underlying inflationary pressure.
[00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:05.300]   - On Sax's point about the equity markets,
[00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:06.900]   there is this thing that people look at
[00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:08.100]   called the Buffett indicator,
[00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:11.700]   which is the total value of the Wilshire 5,000
[00:43:11.700 --> 00:43:13.060]   divided by GDP.
[00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:15.700]   He mentioned it in 2000 and said
[00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:17.940]   it's probably the most reliable measure
[00:43:17.940 --> 00:43:21.780]   of where equities are and where they're about to go.
[00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:25.780]   And there is this long-run mean
[00:43:25.780 --> 00:43:28.660]   when you calculate it going back 50, 60 years,
[00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:31.780]   and every time it's had a short-term high,
[00:43:31.780 --> 00:43:34.580]   there's been a pretty meaningful retrade.
[00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:36.420]   So in 2000 in the dot-com bubble,
[00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:38.820]   in 2007 during the great financial crisis,
[00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:40.820]   during COVID,
[00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:44.420]   and now we've actually set an absolute new high
[00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:45.380]   in this thing,
[00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:47.860]   which, again, to the extent that you believe in
[00:43:47.860 --> 00:43:48.820]   indicators like this,
[00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:52.660]   would kind of tell you that at some point here,
[00:43:52.660 --> 00:43:56.180]   equities are probably going to be cheaper
[00:43:56.180 --> 00:43:57.700]   before they're going to get more expensive.
[00:43:57.700 --> 00:44:01.060]   - This is definitely the high end of normal.
[00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:02.980]   Nick, if you pull up the PE chart,
[00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:04.580]   this is the obvious one to look at,
[00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:09.140]   is not just how dramatic the stock market peaks are,
[00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:11.220]   but the price-to-earnings ratio.
[00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:13.540]   And it's at the high end of normal
[00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:18.340]   at like, I don't know, for a 25 PE ratio on average.
[00:44:18.340 --> 00:44:19.460]   - David's right.
[00:44:19.460 --> 00:44:21.140]   How can you get 4.25%
[00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:24.420]   when you have all of these risks looming
[00:44:24.420 --> 00:44:25.540]   over the next 10 years?
[00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:28.180]   Because Howard Marks, his letter,
[00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:31.780]   he had an investment letter that he published this week,
[00:44:31.780 --> 00:44:35.460]   and it was so great because it was so elegant
[00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:36.260]   in its simplicity,
[00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:38.500]   which is investing in an equity
[00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:39.700]   and investing in a bond
[00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:42.660]   are just completely opposite to each other,
[00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:44.500]   even though they're treated and spoken
[00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:46.820]   as if they're the same thing.
[00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:48.340]   And his concept is like,
[00:44:48.340 --> 00:44:49.940]   people need to understand exactly
[00:44:49.940 --> 00:44:52.340]   what the term's fixed income means.
[00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:55.860]   It means that you will get something reliably
[00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:57.060]   over a long period of time.
[00:44:57.060 --> 00:44:58.660]   And so the question is whether,
[00:44:58.660 --> 00:45:01.860]   is that fair knowing everything you know today?
[00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:04.740]   And I mean, all of you guys have said this now
[00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:06.660]   for it feels like years.
[00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:08.660]   And when you show these charts
[00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:12.100]   of like ballooning debts and deficits,
[00:45:12.100 --> 00:45:16.260]   is it reasonable that the market clearing price
[00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:19.940]   for government-issued debt over the next decade is 4%?
[00:45:19.940 --> 00:45:22.900]   I mean, my gosh, it could easily be 6%.
[00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:25.380]   It could easily be 7% or 8%.
[00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:26.500]   That is very scary.
[00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:26.900]   Totally.
[00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:28.660]   The big difference between a bond and a stock
[00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:30.420]   is that the bond provides you with,
[00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:32.340]   like you said, fixed income payments,
[00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:35.780]   and those would be horribly debased
[00:45:35.780 --> 00:45:36.980]   if you have high inflation.
[00:45:36.980 --> 00:45:39.060]   A stock gives you earnings
[00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:41.380]   and a company can always raise its prices.
[00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:44.420]   And so in theory, it should be hedged against inflation.
[00:45:44.420 --> 00:45:48.180]   But both a stock and a bond are similar
[00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:51.700]   in the sense that they're both hurt badly
[00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:53.060]   by rising interest rates, right?
[00:45:53.060 --> 00:45:54.740]   Because the discount rate is higher.
[00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:56.900]   So this is where I'm just not sure about equities
[00:45:56.900 --> 00:46:01.140]   is if we do head into a new regime of higher rates longer,
[00:46:01.140 --> 00:46:03.140]   does that hurt equities
[00:46:03.140 --> 00:46:06.820]   even though equities normally are pretty good inflation hedge?
[00:46:06.820 --> 00:46:08.340]   So I just don't know the answer to that.
[00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:12.980]   I do think we're headed for a period of constraints.
[00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:15.780]   I think that since 2008,
[00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:19.380]   we basically were living in sort of a consequence-free environment
[00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:24.100]   where the Fed could keep interest rates at or near zero.
[00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:26.740]   The federal government could spend as much as it wanted.
[00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:30.260]   We sort of normalized emergency conditions.
[00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:32.580]   First, we had trillion-dollar deficits
[00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:35.540]   as a result of the 2008 GFC,
[00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:36.980]   and then those got normalized.
[00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:40.260]   Then we had $2 trillion deficits as a result of COVID,
[00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:41.540]   and those got normalized.
[00:46:41.540 --> 00:46:44.020]   And then the Fed was also doing QE,
[00:46:44.020 --> 00:46:47.460]   which means that it's buying the US government's own bonds,
[00:46:47.460 --> 00:46:52.500]   thereby propping up US bonds and the bond market.
[00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:54.660]   - So now that's normalized. That's normalized.
[00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:56.580]   - Yeah, keeping interest rates lower
[00:46:56.580 --> 00:46:58.340]   than they otherwise would need to be
[00:46:58.340 --> 00:47:00.820]   to attract those bondholders.
[00:47:00.820 --> 00:47:02.980]   So for about 15 years,
[00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:05.300]   we kind of normalized emergency conditions
[00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:08.580]   and consequence-free spending by the US government.
[00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:12.660]   I think now we may be entering an era of consequences.
[00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:16.420]   And what that means is that you can't push on one aspect
[00:47:16.420 --> 00:47:18.580]   of the federal government's balance sheet
[00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:19.940]   without giving up on something else.
[00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:24.260]   So in other words, if you're going to allow higher inflation,
[00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:26.020]   basically monetizing the debt,
[00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:28.100]   the bond markets are going to make the government pay
[00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:29.860]   higher interest rates on its debt, right?
[00:47:29.860 --> 00:47:31.060]   Because they're not dumb.
[00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:33.140]   So we're going to be in a world of higher interest rates,
[00:47:33.140 --> 00:47:34.980]   which means that equities get clobbered,
[00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:36.980]   real estate gets clobbered,
[00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:39.300]   the value of people's homes gets clobbered.
[00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:41.220]   So there's real consequences from that.
[00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:43.700]   Or you can tackle inflation,
[00:47:43.700 --> 00:47:46.660]   which means that the Fed's going to have to tighten.
[00:47:46.660 --> 00:47:49.140]   But then I think what that means
[00:47:49.140 --> 00:47:50.900]   is the federal government's going to have to get religion
[00:47:50.900 --> 00:47:52.100]   around spending.
[00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:54.660]   They're not just going to be able to spend all of this money.
[00:47:54.660 --> 00:47:57.940]   - We've seen this, austerity measures in Europe, right?
[00:47:57.940 --> 00:48:01.540]   Were pretty hard for people in Greece and Spain
[00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:02.580]   and to get their heads around.
[00:48:02.580 --> 00:48:04.340]   And I think Americans are going to have to get used to,
[00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:07.140]   we can't just spend and give handouts constantly.
[00:48:07.140 --> 00:48:08.580]   On the equity side, though,
[00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:09.940]   there's also the concept, Sachs,
[00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:13.060]   that you can cut spending and increase earnings
[00:48:13.060 --> 00:48:16.100]   and that that's well within your control
[00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:17.380]   as a CEO and board.
[00:48:17.380 --> 00:48:19.620]   And that's exactly what we've seen coming out of COVID.
[00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:21.300]   And I said it here a couple of years ago,
[00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:22.660]   I think the earnings are going to do well
[00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:25.140]   because people have this other lever
[00:48:25.140 --> 00:48:27.780]   and they can just turn the dial and reduce spending
[00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:28.740]   and increase earnings.
[00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:30.180]   And it's like, oh, that's painful,
[00:48:30.180 --> 00:48:34.260]   but it's not so painful that it's not worth doing.
[00:48:34.260 --> 00:48:36.020]   And so corporations have gotten religion
[00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:40.180]   around cost-cutting and austerity and increasing earnings.
[00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:43.620]   The question is, and individuals have to,
[00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:45.460]   so they're pushing out buying new cars
[00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:48.020]   and spending on travel.
[00:48:48.020 --> 00:48:49.540]   - Well, let me just give you guys-
[00:48:49.540 --> 00:48:51.460]   - When does the government get that austerity
[00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:53.940]   that companies and individuals are forced to do?
[00:48:53.940 --> 00:48:56.340]   And that's the problem you keep talking about, Freeberg,
[00:48:56.340 --> 00:48:58.900]   is this entire election cycle
[00:48:58.900 --> 00:49:00.980]   is about who can give more free (beep)
[00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:02.020]   enough with the free (beep)
[00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:03.620]   like somebody has got to be an adult in the room
[00:49:03.620 --> 00:49:06.180]   and say, we don't have any more free (beep) left.
[00:49:06.180 --> 00:49:08.580]   - I think this is what the market is saying
[00:49:08.580 --> 00:49:10.580]   is that regardless of who gets elected here,
[00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:13.780]   they've both kind of shown that the deficit will increase,
[00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:16.580]   not decrease under their presidency.
[00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:19.460]   And look, maybe that is positioning to get elected.
[00:49:19.460 --> 00:49:22.340]   And maybe there is a kind of more rational
[00:49:22.340 --> 00:49:25.060]   underlying economic advisory group
[00:49:25.060 --> 00:49:26.980]   that is counseling a different path
[00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:28.180]   than what they are presenting.
[00:49:28.180 --> 00:49:31.300]   And I hope to whoever is listening
[00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:34.580]   that that is the case for both candidates,
[00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:36.740]   very deeply hope.
[00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:38.500]   If you look at what happened in Argentina,
[00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:40.260]   so we've talked a lot about Javier Mele,
[00:49:40.260 --> 00:49:41.380]   he came in as president.
[00:49:41.380 --> 00:49:44.420]   And his austerity measures
[00:49:44.420 --> 00:49:47.220]   by absolutely slashing government spending
[00:49:47.220 --> 00:49:50.500]   has reduced monthly inflation from 25%
[00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:52.260]   to around three and a half percent.
[00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:54.820]   So he's really kind of brought inflation under control.
[00:49:54.820 --> 00:49:56.100]   But the consequence of that
[00:49:56.100 --> 00:49:58.260]   is that the economy has now shrunk
[00:49:58.260 --> 00:49:59.620]   because the government is spending less.
[00:49:59.620 --> 00:50:01.540]   That means there's less revenue for certain businesses.
[00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:03.460]   There's less income for individuals.
[00:50:03.460 --> 00:50:04.740]   So they spend less.
[00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:08.100]   So the economy has shrunk by 1.7% in the last quarter.
[00:50:08.100 --> 00:50:11.060]   And unemployment has spiked.
[00:50:11.060 --> 00:50:13.620]   So now unemployment is at 8% in Argentina
[00:50:13.620 --> 00:50:14.740]   and it's rising fast.
[00:50:14.740 --> 00:50:18.500]   So for the US to actually execute this policy,
[00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:20.500]   when we have a fundamental mandate
[00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:24.340]   for the Federal Reserve to keep unemployment low,
[00:50:24.340 --> 00:50:27.220]   means that something is gonna have to break.
[00:50:27.220 --> 00:50:30.420]   You can't keep unemployment low and inflation low
[00:50:30.420 --> 00:50:32.980]   if federal spending gets too high
[00:50:32.980 --> 00:50:34.820]   and federal debt gets too high.
[00:50:34.820 --> 00:50:36.020]   So we are in a condition now
[00:50:36.020 --> 00:50:37.860]   where federal debt is too high.
[00:50:37.860 --> 00:50:40.420]   And if we cut federal spending too fast,
[00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:42.660]   we end up seeing unemployment spike.
[00:50:42.660 --> 00:50:44.580]   And if we don't, we're gonna have inflation spike.
[00:50:44.580 --> 00:50:46.100]   - Just one-- - Those are the two paths
[00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:46.660]   we could walk.
[00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:50.500]   - Just one thing to challenge what you say,
[00:50:50.500 --> 00:50:52.100]   'cause I actually, I disagree with it,
[00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:54.820]   is that I don't think that people view
[00:50:54.820 --> 00:50:58.100]   the spending packages of both candidates the same
[00:50:58.100 --> 00:51:00.820]   because the dollar is not created equal.
[00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:03.460]   So there are certain programs
[00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:05.060]   that the Republicans have proposed
[00:51:05.060 --> 00:51:07.860]   that are markedly different
[00:51:07.860 --> 00:51:10.740]   than the programs that the Democrats have proposed,
[00:51:10.740 --> 00:51:12.340]   even if the numbers look the same.
[00:51:12.340 --> 00:51:14.500]   And so this is why I think you have to look
[00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:16.180]   at how the short-term markets,
[00:51:16.180 --> 00:51:18.180]   when they thought Kamala was winning,
[00:51:18.180 --> 00:51:20.420]   behaved versus now the short-term markets,
[00:51:20.420 --> 00:51:22.580]   short-term mean, how do you hedge this risk?
[00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:24.180]   And that has completely changed.
[00:51:24.180 --> 00:51:27.700]   And this is why I mean, over the last 30 days,
[00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:31.780]   you've had a complete and absolute repositioning
[00:51:31.780 --> 00:51:32.980]   of the front end of the yield curve
[00:51:32.980 --> 00:51:35.860]   in terms of risk and who's making the bets.
[00:51:35.860 --> 00:51:38.900]   And I think why is because the Trump package,
[00:51:38.900 --> 00:51:42.660]   whether we agree with him or not,
[00:51:42.660 --> 00:51:45.460]   is viewed as more stimulative
[00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:47.140]   to long-term economic growth,
[00:51:47.140 --> 00:51:49.780]   which is why the inflation risk is being hedged out
[00:51:49.780 --> 00:51:51.780]   versus the Kamala risk,
[00:51:51.780 --> 00:51:53.700]   which is they're just gonna spend money.
[00:51:53.700 --> 00:51:55.780]   Now, on top of that, what I would say is
[00:51:57.380 --> 00:52:02.820]   this may be where Elon Musk being able to
[00:52:02.820 --> 00:52:05.540]   streamline the government
[00:52:05.540 --> 00:52:08.740]   could be an incredible gift for us,
[00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:11.300]   as well as our children and our children's children.
[00:52:11.300 --> 00:52:12.260]   And why is that?
[00:52:12.260 --> 00:52:16.100]   It's because if there's this sort of Damocles
[00:52:16.100 --> 00:52:18.420]   hanging over us constantly of billions
[00:52:18.420 --> 00:52:20.580]   and trillions of dollars of wasteful spending,
[00:52:20.580 --> 00:52:24.740]   he is probably in a position to show us
[00:52:25.540 --> 00:52:28.660]   that we have spent decades spending more
[00:52:28.660 --> 00:52:30.260]   and getting less.
[00:52:30.260 --> 00:52:34.020]   And now we can run the A/B test
[00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:36.900]   where we spend meaningfully, meaningfully less,
[00:52:36.900 --> 00:52:38.900]   cut regulation.
[00:52:38.900 --> 00:52:40.500]   And if we actually get more,
[00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:42.180]   you will have the proof.
[00:52:42.180 --> 00:52:45.860]   And that could set us on a long-term path
[00:52:45.860 --> 00:52:48.980]   of being more judicious in how we spend money.
[00:52:48.980 --> 00:52:51.060]   And I think that we deserve
[00:52:51.060 --> 00:52:52.500]   to run that experiment somehow.
[00:52:52.500 --> 00:52:54.980]   To just go back to your definition of GDP,
[00:52:54.980 --> 00:52:56.580]   it's true that if you cut government,
[00:52:56.580 --> 00:52:58.660]   that might cut GDP
[00:52:58.660 --> 00:53:01.060]   because GDP includes government spending.
[00:53:01.060 --> 00:53:04.420]   However, one could argue that,
[00:53:04.420 --> 00:53:06.660]   although technically that is how the definitions work,
[00:53:06.660 --> 00:53:09.700]   that by cutting government,
[00:53:09.700 --> 00:53:11.860]   you actually unlock resources
[00:53:11.860 --> 00:53:13.700]   that could be used by the private sector
[00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:16.580]   and that ultimately it would lead to more efficiency,
[00:53:16.580 --> 00:53:18.980]   but also stimulate the private sector.
[00:53:18.980 --> 00:53:21.460]   And I think that argument is particularly true
[00:53:21.460 --> 00:53:24.020]   when you've got an economy running at full employment.
[00:53:24.020 --> 00:53:26.340]   So if we had lots of unemployment,
[00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:27.620]   then cutting all these government workers
[00:53:27.620 --> 00:53:28.500]   would be very painful.
[00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:32.500]   But if you've got an economy that's doing quite well
[00:53:32.500 --> 00:53:35.140]   and there's a lot of job creation going on,
[00:53:35.140 --> 00:53:37.300]   then it's a good time to actually cut government
[00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:39.780]   because the private sector can reabsorb these people.
[00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:42.420]   We should use the fact that we still have that,
[00:53:42.420 --> 00:53:44.020]   we have a good employment picture,
[00:53:44.020 --> 00:53:46.180]   to make these painful cuts now,
[00:53:46.180 --> 00:53:49.300]   as opposed to waiting until it would be far more difficult.
[00:53:49.300 --> 00:53:50.900]   - Best point I've heard in a long time.
[00:53:50.900 --> 00:53:52.100]   That's a great point, Sax.
[00:53:52.100 --> 00:53:53.140]   Give us the election update.
[00:53:53.140 --> 00:53:53.620]   What's going on?
[00:53:53.620 --> 00:53:56.900]   Are we gonna get your guy in office?
[00:53:56.900 --> 00:53:59.620]   Is it gonna be Vice President Harris?
[00:53:59.620 --> 00:54:01.940]   What's the sense of what the polls are telling you,
[00:54:01.940 --> 00:54:05.140]   of what the markets are telling us?
[00:54:05.140 --> 00:54:06.260]   What's your read on where we're at?
[00:54:06.260 --> 00:54:08.820]   - All the data is basically pointing one direction,
[00:54:08.820 --> 00:54:10.740]   which is a Trump victory.
[00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:12.260]   And by data, I mean the polling,
[00:54:12.260 --> 00:54:13.540]   I mean the prediction markets
[00:54:13.540 --> 00:54:14.980]   and then the early voting numbers.
[00:54:14.980 --> 00:54:17.380]   So if you look at the polls,
[00:54:17.380 --> 00:54:20.260]   there were two new polls by mainstream media.
[00:54:20.260 --> 00:54:22.820]   One, the Wall Street Journal yesterday
[00:54:22.820 --> 00:54:26.020]   said that Trump was up three nationally.
[00:54:26.020 --> 00:54:29.220]   And I think CNBC had a poll this morning
[00:54:29.220 --> 00:54:31.860]   saying that Trump was up two nationally.
[00:54:31.860 --> 00:54:33.620]   That's very good because...
[00:54:33.620 --> 00:54:34.740]   - That's the popular vote.
[00:54:34.740 --> 00:54:36.100]   - That's the popular vote.
[00:54:36.100 --> 00:54:38.820]   So if Trump is winning the popular vote, it's a landslide.
[00:54:38.820 --> 00:54:41.220]   Most prognosticators say that
[00:54:41.220 --> 00:54:44.180]   because Republicans have a slight electoral college advantage,
[00:54:44.180 --> 00:54:47.220]   that Harris would need to win the popular vote
[00:54:47.220 --> 00:54:49.780]   by more than 2% to have a chance
[00:54:49.780 --> 00:54:50.980]   at winning the electoral college.
[00:54:50.980 --> 00:54:54.340]   So if Trump is winning the popular vote,
[00:54:54.340 --> 00:54:55.380]   then it's a landslide.
[00:54:55.380 --> 00:54:59.540]   Second area is if you look at the state-by-state polling,
[00:54:59.540 --> 00:55:01.220]   Trump has been advancing
[00:55:01.220 --> 00:55:04.500]   pretty much in every battleground state
[00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:05.860]   for the last couple of weeks.
[00:55:05.860 --> 00:55:09.460]   If you use RCP, Trump is now ahead slightly
[00:55:09.460 --> 00:55:10.660]   in every battleground state
[00:55:10.660 --> 00:55:12.660]   and the momentum is all towards Trump.
[00:55:12.660 --> 00:55:15.140]   And then the final data point is around early voting
[00:55:15.140 --> 00:55:17.540]   in states where they have this early voting
[00:55:17.540 --> 00:55:18.660]   and put out the numbers.
[00:55:18.660 --> 00:55:21.060]   The Republicans are tracking well ahead
[00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:22.900]   of where they were in 2020.
[00:55:22.900 --> 00:55:24.340]   Now, there's still a question of,
[00:55:24.340 --> 00:55:27.140]   does this mean that Republicans
[00:55:27.140 --> 00:55:29.620]   are just shifting their votes to voting earlier
[00:55:29.620 --> 00:55:32.180]   and then they'll do less well on election day?
[00:55:32.180 --> 00:55:33.380]   There's always that chance.
[00:55:33.380 --> 00:55:36.420]   But right now, if you're a Republican,
[00:55:36.420 --> 00:55:37.860]   it's what you wanna see.
[00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:38.820]   And if you're a Democrat,
[00:55:38.820 --> 00:55:40.580]   it's definitely not what you wanna see.
[00:55:40.580 --> 00:55:43.460]   - Yeah, and the essay that Nate Silver wrote
[00:55:43.460 --> 00:55:45.940]   that was published by the New York Times yesterday said,
[00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:48.020]   "It's a 50/50 toss-up.
[00:55:48.020 --> 00:55:49.140]   "Either candidate could win,
[00:55:49.140 --> 00:55:51.220]   "but my gut tells me it's gonna be Trump."
[00:55:51.220 --> 00:55:52.740]   He's kind of indicated that's where,
[00:55:52.740 --> 00:55:56.020]   as a guy who's obviously been a big prognosticator,
[00:55:56.020 --> 00:55:58.020]   it says the market's headed.
[00:55:58.020 --> 00:56:00.900]   J. Cal, do you think Sachs is right on this?
[00:56:00.900 --> 00:56:01.540]   Anything you're picking up for me?
[00:56:01.540 --> 00:56:02.900]   - Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot to mention prediction markets.
[00:56:02.900 --> 00:56:04.020]   Prediction markets have moved
[00:56:04.020 --> 00:56:06.180]   very, very sharply in favor of Trump.
[00:56:06.180 --> 00:56:09.620]   It's almost two-thirds, one-third now in favor of Trump.
[00:56:09.620 --> 00:56:12.340]   So there's been a huge move among bettors
[00:56:12.340 --> 00:56:13.460]   that Trump is gonna win.
[00:56:13.460 --> 00:56:14.500]   - On polymarket.
[00:56:14.980 --> 00:56:16.900]   - Yeah, polymarket and then Cal-she as well.
[00:56:16.900 --> 00:56:18.260]   - Do you think it's over, J. Cal?
[00:56:18.260 --> 00:56:19.380]   - I'll go with Nate.
[00:56:19.380 --> 00:56:23.940]   I mean, I think Nate's probably the best thinker on this
[00:56:23.940 --> 00:56:26.660]   who I think puts a lot of effort into it.
[00:56:26.660 --> 00:56:29.540]   And if he says it's 50/50 with a slight advantage to Trump,
[00:56:29.540 --> 00:56:31.300]   I think I would go with his gut.
[00:56:31.300 --> 00:56:34.100]   But he's saying don't trust anybody.
[00:56:34.100 --> 00:56:35.780]   I don't trust the prediction markets.
[00:56:35.780 --> 00:56:39.780]   And I think the prediction markets are closing that gap
[00:56:39.780 --> 00:56:40.820]   as we get closer
[00:56:40.820 --> 00:56:42.180]   'cause they are easily manipulated.
[00:56:42.180 --> 00:56:44.180]   Polymarket is only offshore, right?
[00:56:44.180 --> 00:56:47.620]   The U.S. market is not allowed to participate in polymarket.
[00:56:47.620 --> 00:56:49.460]   So it's all foreign investors.
[00:56:49.460 --> 00:56:52.340]   Now, of course, Americans could be putting money overseas
[00:56:52.340 --> 00:56:56.020]   somehow and using foreign accounts to place these bets.
[00:56:56.020 --> 00:56:57.620]   I'm guessing if you were a sharp
[00:56:57.620 --> 00:57:00.260]   and you really wanna make money, that's what you would do.
[00:57:00.260 --> 00:57:01.700]   So I don't know what percentage of it-
[00:57:01.700 --> 00:57:04.260]   - By the way, it was reported this morning
[00:57:04.260 --> 00:57:09.140]   that a French trader has bet $45 million on Trump
[00:57:09.140 --> 00:57:10.740]   on polymarket, that he is the whale.
[00:57:10.740 --> 00:57:11.780]   He's a French national
[00:57:11.780 --> 00:57:13.940]   with "extensive trading experience."
[00:57:13.940 --> 00:57:15.780]   He's not "manipulating the market."
[00:57:15.780 --> 00:57:17.620]   He just really is trying to build a big position.
[00:57:17.620 --> 00:57:19.300]   So he sounds like he's a pretty active trader
[00:57:19.300 --> 00:57:20.740]   that's made the big move.
[00:57:20.740 --> 00:57:22.260]   - I mean, it's a crypto-based site.
[00:57:22.260 --> 00:57:24.260]   So you get the benefit of like,
[00:57:24.260 --> 00:57:27.140]   you can track some amount of this on blockchains
[00:57:27.140 --> 00:57:28.900]   and then eventually find the person.
[00:57:28.900 --> 00:57:30.660]   But because it's crypto as well,
[00:57:30.660 --> 00:57:32.180]   you can also hide yourself pretty well
[00:57:32.180 --> 00:57:34.100]   with tumblers and other systems.
[00:57:34.100 --> 00:57:37.460]   So I would discount polymarket a bit.
[00:57:37.460 --> 00:57:39.540]   It's probably not as extreme as it seems,
[00:57:39.540 --> 00:57:44.340]   but it does seem like Kamala has not helped herself
[00:57:44.340 --> 00:57:45.300]   with the interviews.
[00:57:45.300 --> 00:57:46.260]   They haven't been great.
[00:57:46.260 --> 00:57:51.700]   And it is a toss-up.
[00:57:51.700 --> 00:57:52.180]   And so-
[00:57:52.180 --> 00:57:54.180]   - Jamal, any surprise?
[00:57:54.180 --> 00:57:54.660]   - Yeah.
[00:57:54.660 --> 00:57:56.340]   - Any October surprise still coming?
[00:57:56.340 --> 00:57:57.460]   I mean, there've been a few attempts
[00:57:57.460 --> 00:57:58.260]   the last couple of days.
[00:57:58.260 --> 00:57:59.300]   I mean, it seems like the rhetoric-
[00:57:59.300 --> 00:58:01.540]   - The last 24 hours, there've been some really gnarly ones
[00:58:01.540 --> 00:58:02.900]   that we shouldn't give it.
[00:58:02.900 --> 00:58:04.740]   I don't think we should give any credence to,
[00:58:04.740 --> 00:58:07.940]   but some Republicans have been coming out
[00:58:07.940 --> 00:58:09.860]   talking about like a really gnarly one
[00:58:09.860 --> 00:58:11.940]   about the Republican side.
[00:58:11.940 --> 00:58:15.300]   And I mean, it's not much more gnarly
[00:58:15.300 --> 00:58:17.620]   than other things that have been said about Trump already
[00:58:17.620 --> 00:58:19.940]   and judgments that Trump is against him already
[00:58:19.940 --> 00:58:20.900]   for a hundred million dollars.
[00:58:20.900 --> 00:58:22.260]   So it's in that vein.
[00:58:22.260 --> 00:58:25.620]   But I do think that that looks to me like it's cap.
[00:58:25.620 --> 00:58:28.740]   And I think there's gonna be a lot of fake news,
[00:58:28.740 --> 00:58:30.580]   maybe even deep fakes that come out,
[00:58:30.580 --> 00:58:32.180]   you know, in the last week or two.
[00:58:32.180 --> 00:58:34.260]   So I think people should not trust anything
[00:58:34.260 --> 00:58:35.540]   they see on social media.
[00:58:36.500 --> 00:58:38.100]   Be very careful with that information.
[00:58:38.100 --> 00:58:42.500]   - I'll tell you guys, my kind of view is like,
[00:58:42.500 --> 00:58:44.500]   things seem to be getting more inflammatory
[00:58:44.500 --> 00:58:46.100]   leading up to the election here.
[00:58:46.100 --> 00:58:48.740]   It's like, we've got 12 days left or whatever it is.
[00:58:48.740 --> 00:58:53.060]   And the rhetoric and the tonality of the stuff
[00:58:53.060 --> 00:58:56.100]   that's being said is getting so nasty on both sides.
[00:58:56.100 --> 00:59:02.260]   And I just worry more about the reconciliation,
[00:59:02.260 --> 00:59:04.740]   reconstruction phase that needs to happen in America.
[00:59:04.740 --> 00:59:06.100]   - Do you actually see it on both sides?
[00:59:06.100 --> 00:59:07.700]   Is it equal on both sides?
[00:59:07.700 --> 00:59:10.100]   That's your observation.
[00:59:10.100 --> 00:59:16.740]   - I think like Trump leaning out the window of McDonald's
[00:59:16.740 --> 00:59:18.340]   and it was, I mean, I laughed pretty hard
[00:59:18.340 --> 00:59:20.100]   when he was like, someone said to him
[00:59:20.100 --> 00:59:20.900]   when they interviewed Trump
[00:59:20.900 --> 00:59:22.260]   when he was serving French fries.
[00:59:22.260 --> 00:59:24.260]   And he said something like,
[00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:26.580]   "I've now worked in McDonald's 15 minutes longer
[00:59:26.580 --> 00:59:27.540]   than Kamala has."
[00:59:27.540 --> 00:59:28.900]   And then one of the reporters said,
[00:59:28.900 --> 00:59:30.580]   "Well, why do you think she would lie about that?"
[00:59:30.580 --> 00:59:31.460]   And he leans out the window.
[00:59:31.460 --> 00:59:33.460]   He said, "Because she's lying Kamala."
[00:59:33.460 --> 00:59:35.460]   And you know, it's a funny joke.
[00:59:35.460 --> 00:59:36.100]   That's his quip.
[00:59:36.100 --> 00:59:37.060]   He makes fun of everyone.
[00:59:37.060 --> 00:59:39.300]   But I think the whole thing about making fun of everyone,
[00:59:39.300 --> 00:59:42.340]   it's such a different tone and a different rhetoric
[00:59:42.340 --> 00:59:43.620]   than I think what's gonna be needed.
[00:59:43.620 --> 00:59:45.460]   'Cause imagine if she wins
[00:59:45.460 --> 00:59:48.340]   and he's painted her as being a liar
[00:59:48.340 --> 00:59:50.020]   and crooked and deep state.
[00:59:50.020 --> 00:59:51.220]   I mean, look, I'm not gonna try and-
[00:59:51.220 --> 00:59:53.060]   - I don't know how you can possibly compare that
[00:59:53.060 --> 00:59:54.420]   to what the Democrats are saying right now,
[00:59:54.420 --> 00:59:56.180]   which is that Trump is literally Hitler.
[00:59:56.180 --> 00:59:57.220]   - Literally Hitler.
[00:59:57.220 --> 00:59:57.940]   - They're calling him a fascist.
[00:59:57.940 --> 00:59:58.820]   She called him a fascist.
[00:59:58.820 --> 01:00:01.300]   - And now she said, "It's democracy's on the line."
[01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:03.380]   And obviously when you say something like that,
[01:00:03.940 --> 01:00:06.180]   when you say that the fundamental system
[01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:09.940]   of the electoral process is on the line,
[01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:14.180]   it implies that if he wins, we've ended democracy.
[01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:16.260]   That will inevitably lead people to feel
[01:00:16.260 --> 01:00:20.260]   like we are in a place of civil chaos.
[01:00:20.260 --> 01:00:21.940]   And I don't think that anyone's gonna feel good
[01:00:21.940 --> 01:00:23.140]   coming out of this.
[01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:26.340]   How do you guys think we kind of deal
[01:00:26.340 --> 01:00:28.660]   with the election outcome here?
[01:00:28.660 --> 01:00:29.620]   One side or the other?
[01:00:29.620 --> 01:00:30.100]   - I mean-
[01:00:30.100 --> 01:00:31.860]   - Half the country's gonna hate the president
[01:00:31.860 --> 01:00:34.180]   and half the country is gonna hate where we are
[01:00:34.180 --> 01:00:35.300]   and how we sit as a country.
[01:00:35.300 --> 01:00:36.340]   And half the country is gonna think
[01:00:36.340 --> 01:00:37.700]   that democracy is over.
[01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:40.500]   I mean, one half is gonna feel like this is the end.
[01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:42.820]   And is it just a temporary thing
[01:00:42.820 --> 01:00:44.980]   and everyone reconciled and we all get back to work
[01:00:44.980 --> 01:00:47.380]   and the election's over and whoever wins, wins?
[01:00:47.380 --> 01:00:50.740]   - I think, unfortunately, the mainstream media
[01:00:50.740 --> 01:00:53.220]   is responsible for giving roughly half the country
[01:00:53.220 --> 01:00:55.940]   a psychosis about Trump because they are pushing out
[01:00:55.940 --> 01:00:57.860]   this rhetoric nonstop that he's a fascist,
[01:00:57.860 --> 01:00:58.980]   that he's Hitler.
[01:00:58.980 --> 01:01:00.900]   They keep putting out all these fake stories.
[01:01:01.540 --> 01:01:04.180]   And they are basically training people
[01:01:04.180 --> 01:01:07.460]   or indoctrinating them that he's a threat to democracy.
[01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:08.820]   I was having dinner last night with someone
[01:01:08.820 --> 01:01:10.900]   who's a Democrat who pretty much gets all their information
[01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:13.780]   from mainstream media and she's terrified of this.
[01:01:13.780 --> 01:01:16.500]   It's just not who Donald Trump is.
[01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:17.860]   It's ridiculous hyperbole.
[01:01:17.860 --> 01:01:21.060]   But if you're locked in that media ecosystem
[01:01:21.060 --> 01:01:21.860]   and that's all you hear,
[01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:23.380]   you really are frightened by this.
[01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:27.380]   So I think that the media's irresponsibility,
[01:01:27.380 --> 01:01:29.940]   the way that they don't report honestly
[01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:31.700]   and that they gin up these threats
[01:01:31.700 --> 01:01:33.860]   has really terrified half the country.
[01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:37.140]   - Do you think that the Trump is Hitler rhetoric
[01:01:37.140 --> 01:01:38.740]   indicates that the Democrats feel--
[01:01:38.740 --> 01:01:40.900]   - Well, look, it's usually a part of lying.
[01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:42.980]   I mean, that's like pretty par for the course.
[01:01:42.980 --> 01:01:44.340]   What's so horrible about that?
[01:01:44.340 --> 01:01:46.180]   I mean, you could make the argument
[01:01:46.180 --> 01:01:47.860]   that she's lied about a lot of things.
[01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:51.060]   As Anderson Cooper interrogated her quite well
[01:01:51.060 --> 01:01:52.980]   just yesterday on that town hall,
[01:01:52.980 --> 01:01:55.060]   he pointed out that she had said 50 times
[01:01:55.060 --> 01:01:57.220]   that Trump's wall was a stupid idea
[01:01:57.220 --> 01:01:59.220]   and now she appears to be in favor of it.
[01:01:59.220 --> 01:02:01.620]   So I think that accusing your opponent of lying
[01:02:01.620 --> 01:02:03.700]   is pretty par for the course for a politician.
[01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:05.140]   What's not par for the course
[01:02:05.140 --> 01:02:07.780]   is saying that your opponent is literally Hitler
[01:02:07.780 --> 01:02:08.500]   and a fascist.
[01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:11.140]   That's just going to a whole different level of rhetoric.
[01:02:11.140 --> 01:02:13.620]   - Okay.
[01:02:13.620 --> 01:02:16.020]   Chamath, do you think we're in a nasty state
[01:02:16.020 --> 01:02:17.060]   and we're gonna be able to get out of it
[01:02:17.060 --> 01:02:17.700]   after the election?
[01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:19.860]   - I think we're gonna be fine.
[01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:20.660]   - Okay.
[01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:22.420]   - I'm actually pretty optimistic
[01:02:22.420 --> 01:02:24.260]   'cause I actually don't think it's gonna be that close.
[01:02:24.260 --> 01:02:25.940]   I mean, right now it's looking like
[01:02:26.820 --> 01:02:28.980]   maybe landslide's too strong a word,
[01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:31.060]   but a solid victory for Trump.
[01:02:31.060 --> 01:02:32.500]   That's what the polls are showing.
[01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:33.860]   That's what the prediction markets are showing.
[01:02:33.860 --> 01:02:35.380]   That's what the early voting is showing.
[01:02:35.380 --> 01:02:38.020]   And if you look at all the other data points right now,
[01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:41.060]   it's showing Trump winning pretty handily.
[01:02:41.060 --> 01:02:43.380]   The other data point that we haven't talked about
[01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:45.140]   is just how these campaigns are acting
[01:02:45.140 --> 01:02:46.260]   in the final stretch.
[01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:48.580]   If you look at the Trump campaign,
[01:02:48.580 --> 01:02:50.260]   it's pretty much steady as she goes.
[01:02:50.260 --> 01:02:52.180]   You look at the Kamala campaign
[01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:53.860]   and they're in this throwing spaghetti
[01:02:53.860 --> 01:02:55.140]   against the wall mode.
[01:02:55.140 --> 01:02:59.140]   They're back to kind of the dark Brandon type messaging
[01:02:59.140 --> 01:03:01.780]   where the reason to vote for us is Trump's a fascist.
[01:03:01.780 --> 01:03:04.500]   This is very different than their messaging
[01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:07.860]   when they made the switcheroo from Biden to Kamala, right?
[01:03:07.860 --> 01:03:09.700]   When they first made that switch,
[01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:12.580]   they said, okay, let's get away from this dark Brandon
[01:03:12.580 --> 01:03:14.180]   threat to democracy type messaging.
[01:03:14.180 --> 01:03:15.220]   It doesn't seem to be working.
[01:03:15.220 --> 01:03:19.220]   Let's emphasize Kamala Harris as a change agent,
[01:03:19.220 --> 01:03:21.060]   as a transformational candidate,
[01:03:21.060 --> 01:03:24.180]   as a candidate of joy and positive vibes.
[01:03:24.180 --> 01:03:26.500]   And they did get a big bounce in the polls because of that.
[01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:30.100]   The problem is that over the last couple of months,
[01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:33.460]   that sort of bounce in the polls has worn off
[01:03:33.460 --> 01:03:35.540]   as Harris has not been able to explain
[01:03:35.540 --> 01:03:37.700]   what she would change.
[01:03:37.700 --> 01:03:39.380]   She keeps getting asked in all these interviews,
[01:03:39.380 --> 01:03:41.060]   what would you do differently than Joe Biden?
[01:03:41.060 --> 01:03:44.260]   Anderson Cooper just asked her that yesterday
[01:03:44.260 --> 01:03:45.700]   for like the 19th time.
[01:03:45.700 --> 01:03:47.700]   And she still does not have an answer to that question.
[01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:50.340]   And so the problem she has is that
[01:03:50.340 --> 01:03:53.780]   this sort of veneer they gave her as this change agent
[01:03:53.780 --> 01:03:55.220]   has kind of worn off
[01:03:55.220 --> 01:03:58.580]   and she's seen as a continuation of Biden
[01:03:58.580 --> 01:04:00.980]   and the public does not want a continuation of Biden.
[01:04:00.980 --> 01:04:04.100]   And so now it feels like they're frantically
[01:04:04.100 --> 01:04:06.100]   trying to figure out how to reposition.
[01:04:06.100 --> 01:04:11.380]   They're back to the anti-Trump sort of hysterical messaging,
[01:04:11.380 --> 01:04:12.180]   which didn't work.
[01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:13.300]   It wasn't working three months ago
[01:04:13.300 --> 01:04:15.140]   when they made the switcheroo.
[01:04:15.140 --> 01:04:17.220]   So I tend to think that if you look at the behavior
[01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:19.940]   of these campaigns, it's pretty easy to see
[01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:23.540]   which one feels confident and which one is in a panic.
[01:04:23.540 --> 01:04:25.460]   - Okay, Jake, if you could go back in time
[01:04:25.460 --> 01:04:30.020]   and you were Kamala's advisor when she became the nominee,
[01:04:30.020 --> 01:04:33.540]   what would you have advised her to do differently
[01:04:33.540 --> 01:04:35.700]   than she has done in this campaign today?
[01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:37.220]   - I would have had a speed run primary
[01:04:37.220 --> 01:04:39.460]   and I would have let democracy play out.
[01:04:39.460 --> 01:04:40.500]   That was the big mistake.
[01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:43.860]   If the Democrats lose, I think they'll look back on it and say--
[01:04:43.860 --> 01:04:44.900]   - 100% agree with you, 100%.
[01:04:44.900 --> 01:04:47.780]   - And then in terms of thinking about
[01:04:47.780 --> 01:04:53.220]   why people believe that Trump is an existential threat
[01:04:53.220 --> 01:04:56.020]   to democracy, I encourage everybody who's a fan
[01:04:56.020 --> 01:04:58.820]   of this podcast to go back to episode 16
[01:04:58.820 --> 01:05:00.580]   of the "All In" podcast.
[01:05:00.580 --> 01:05:02.660]   And that's the episode where we all reacted
[01:05:02.660 --> 01:05:05.540]   the week of January 6th.
[01:05:05.540 --> 01:05:09.700]   And we all had great consensus amongst us
[01:05:09.700 --> 01:05:11.700]   that we thought this was one of the most disgusting,
[01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:14.340]   horrific days in the history of the country
[01:05:14.340 --> 01:05:19.620]   and that Trump was trying to overthrow the election results
[01:05:19.620 --> 01:05:22.740]   and that he was doing so in a non-democratic fashion.
[01:05:22.740 --> 01:05:24.420]   Now I know some people have re-underrided
[01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:25.380]   or changed their positions,
[01:05:25.380 --> 01:05:28.340]   but I encourage you all to pause this episode
[01:05:28.340 --> 01:05:31.060]   and go back and listen to our very thoughtful discussion
[01:05:31.060 --> 01:05:33.460]   on episode 16 of the "All In" podcast,
[01:05:33.460 --> 01:05:34.740]   'cause we were scared as well.
[01:05:34.740 --> 01:05:36.980]   - I think that things happen in a moment
[01:05:36.980 --> 01:05:38.900]   and you have to have enough compassion
[01:05:38.900 --> 01:05:40.500]   to say you react in a moment,
[01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:43.380]   but then you also have to have the intellect
[01:05:43.380 --> 01:05:45.300]   to separate yourself from the things that happen,
[01:05:45.300 --> 01:05:48.420]   learn more, and possibly and potentially change your mind.
[01:05:48.420 --> 01:05:51.380]   I don't want to be defined by a thing
[01:05:51.380 --> 01:05:52.500]   that I said in a moment.
[01:05:53.460 --> 01:05:55.220]   And I won't do that to other people.
[01:05:55.220 --> 01:05:58.420]   In that moment, I thought what happened was really terrible.
[01:05:58.420 --> 01:06:01.060]   And then since then, I've got to know the person
[01:06:01.060 --> 01:06:03.460]   and I don't think that he actually incited much of anything.
[01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:05.380]   That's my belief.
[01:06:05.380 --> 01:06:07.380]   - Yeah, and that's fine, that's your belief,
[01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:08.900]   but I do think there's another group of people
[01:06:08.900 --> 01:06:11.620]   who agree with your original assessment, yeah.
[01:06:11.620 --> 01:06:13.300]   - Well, I think that those people
[01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:15.060]   need to also re-underwrite the way I did
[01:06:15.060 --> 01:06:18.740]   because I'm not really want to flip for random reasons.
[01:06:18.740 --> 01:06:20.420]   But that's not the point.
[01:06:20.420 --> 01:06:22.980]   The point is, I think that if you still believe
[01:06:22.980 --> 01:06:23.940]   what you believed then,
[01:06:23.940 --> 01:06:26.020]   then you should tell people to listen to what you said.
[01:06:26.020 --> 01:06:27.540]   - Yeah, listen to what I said.
[01:06:27.540 --> 01:06:29.060]   - Okay, but there are a lot of-
[01:06:29.060 --> 01:06:29.860]   - And listen to what Zack said
[01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:30.740]   and listen to what Freeberg said.
[01:06:30.740 --> 01:06:32.340]   I thought we had a very productive discussion
[01:06:32.340 --> 01:06:32.900]   when it happened.
[01:06:32.900 --> 01:06:34.180]   I think people have memory hold it.
[01:06:34.180 --> 01:06:35.540]   - What you're trying to say,
[01:06:35.540 --> 01:06:37.780]   which I partially disagree with,
[01:06:37.780 --> 01:06:40.900]   is those beliefs have changed over time.
[01:06:40.900 --> 01:06:42.980]   And I think it's more balanced for you to say
[01:06:42.980 --> 01:06:45.780]   that that's a point in time.
[01:06:45.780 --> 01:06:49.220]   And if you believe that that point in time still exists,
[01:06:49.220 --> 01:06:50.900]   that's fine for you to say that.
[01:06:50.900 --> 01:06:52.660]   But I think that's the way that you should say it.
[01:06:52.660 --> 01:06:54.020]   The other thing that I would like to say
[01:06:54.020 --> 01:06:57.060]   about this election, which I find really interesting,
[01:06:57.060 --> 01:06:59.700]   is we are in the part of the cycle now
[01:06:59.700 --> 01:07:04.260]   where the side that's losing is going to panic.
[01:07:04.260 --> 01:07:07.460]   And I think it's happened a couple of times,
[01:07:07.460 --> 01:07:09.140]   but I would just remind everybody,
[01:07:09.140 --> 01:07:10.820]   we have run the A/B test.
[01:07:10.820 --> 01:07:13.300]   We know what the presidency
[01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:14.740]   is going to look like under Trump,
[01:07:14.740 --> 01:07:17.460]   except you get the real vice president
[01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:20.260]   plus RFK plus Elon Musk,
[01:07:20.260 --> 01:07:21.540]   whether you like them or not.
[01:07:21.540 --> 01:07:23.540]   But my point is, I think you need to consider
[01:07:23.540 --> 01:07:25.700]   that you're getting four for the price of one.
[01:07:25.700 --> 01:07:29.780]   And if the other side, if Harris wins,
[01:07:29.780 --> 01:07:34.820]   you mostly know what the trend will be,
[01:07:34.820 --> 01:07:36.340]   because you've seen the trend
[01:07:36.340 --> 01:07:37.620]   under four years of Biden.
[01:07:37.620 --> 01:07:40.100]   The second thing is,
[01:07:40.100 --> 01:07:42.820]   I think it's interesting to see
[01:07:42.820 --> 01:07:46.100]   that when you get into the home stretch,
[01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:48.500]   the losing side tends to turn on itself
[01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:50.740]   because they start to play protectionism
[01:07:50.740 --> 01:07:51.700]   for their own careers.
[01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:54.180]   And there's a lot of stuff
[01:07:54.180 --> 01:07:55.860]   that I think you can consume
[01:07:55.860 --> 01:07:56.980]   that starts to show that.
[01:07:56.980 --> 01:07:59.140]   And I think that's just an interesting observation.
[01:07:59.140 --> 01:08:01.540]   A lot of the tried and true,
[01:08:01.540 --> 01:08:04.260]   most reliable media sources
[01:08:04.260 --> 01:08:07.220]   that I think we're trying to navigate
[01:08:07.220 --> 01:08:10.180]   as much as possible for a pro-Harris presidency
[01:08:10.180 --> 01:08:12.900]   are starting to push back in a way
[01:08:12.900 --> 01:08:15.300]   that I find a little surprising.
[01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:17.300]   I think the CNN town hall yesterday
[01:08:17.300 --> 01:08:18.740]   was one of those moments for me
[01:08:18.740 --> 01:08:21.380]   where even people like David Axelrod,
[01:08:21.380 --> 01:08:23.940]   a little bit throwing Kamala Harris under the bus.
[01:08:23.940 --> 01:08:25.140]   I didn't expect that at all.
[01:08:25.140 --> 01:08:27.540]   So I think it's just important to observe
[01:08:27.540 --> 01:08:28.580]   that these things are happening.
[01:08:28.580 --> 01:08:30.180]   - I would agree with that.
[01:08:30.180 --> 01:08:32.340]   We're going to make it through whatever.
[01:08:32.340 --> 01:08:34.580]   Hold on, let me just give one thing to your point, Chamath,
[01:08:34.580 --> 01:08:36.820]   since I am challenging you
[01:08:36.820 --> 01:08:38.740]   with that episode 16 call out.
[01:08:38.740 --> 01:08:42.420]   I do hope that whoever wins,
[01:08:42.420 --> 01:08:44.100]   we all support that person
[01:08:44.100 --> 01:08:46.020]   to do the best they can for all Americans.
[01:08:46.020 --> 01:08:47.700]   And that's always been my commitment.
[01:08:47.700 --> 01:08:48.980]   And I did it the last two times
[01:08:48.980 --> 01:08:50.900]   and we will survive this one.
[01:08:50.900 --> 01:08:53.220]   I don't think we'll survive two or three of these cycles
[01:08:53.220 --> 01:08:54.500]   if we spend 10 trillion each time.
[01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:58.180]   - Just to add, since Jake,
[01:08:58.180 --> 01:08:59.140]   how you're referencing an episode
[01:08:59.140 --> 01:09:01.380]   that I participated in and said things.
[01:09:01.380 --> 01:09:03.700]   I mean, look, I think that the goal
[01:09:03.700 --> 01:09:06.820]   of the mainstream media has been to try and keep us
[01:09:06.820 --> 01:09:09.700]   in the heat of that moment for four years.
[01:09:09.700 --> 01:09:13.460]   I mean, if you've watched MSNBC for the last four years,
[01:09:13.460 --> 01:09:15.860]   it's like J6 is occurring every single day.
[01:09:15.860 --> 01:09:18.020]   I mean, this is all that they talk about.
[01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:19.140]   But I think like Chamath said,
[01:09:19.140 --> 01:09:21.860]   we have learned a lot of things since that day.
[01:09:21.860 --> 01:09:23.380]   I didn't know, for example,
[01:09:23.380 --> 01:09:27.380]   that Twitter had censored President Trump's tweets
[01:09:27.380 --> 01:09:29.620]   telling all of these people to go home,
[01:09:29.620 --> 01:09:32.180]   that basically he said to protest peacefully.
[01:09:32.180 --> 01:09:33.940]   And then when they rioted,
[01:09:33.940 --> 01:09:35.220]   that he actually published tweets
[01:09:35.220 --> 01:09:36.900]   to try and tell them to go home.
[01:09:36.900 --> 01:09:38.740]   So that was new information.
[01:09:38.740 --> 01:09:40.740]   And what that came out,
[01:09:40.740 --> 01:09:43.300]   remember at the beginning of the whole primary cycle,
[01:09:43.300 --> 01:09:47.220]   Trump did that town hall on CNN with Caitlyn Collins,
[01:09:47.220 --> 01:09:49.060]   where he dramatically pulled the piece of paper
[01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:50.820]   out of his pocket with the tweets
[01:09:50.820 --> 01:09:52.100]   and started reading them.
[01:09:52.100 --> 01:09:54.020]   That was a lot of new information for people.
[01:09:54.020 --> 01:09:55.780]   And I think that gave him a different picture.
[01:09:55.780 --> 01:09:57.060]   And then I think one other point
[01:09:57.060 --> 01:09:58.500]   that I think is important is that,
[01:09:58.500 --> 01:10:00.260]   imagine if the press had tried to keep us
[01:10:00.260 --> 01:10:04.100]   in the heat of the moment of the summer of 2020 riots,
[01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:05.860]   the George Floyd riots,
[01:10:05.860 --> 01:10:08.260]   then we'd have a very different perception
[01:10:08.260 --> 01:10:12.020]   of which party was in favor of riots.
[01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:14.020]   Because Tim Walz was the governor of Minnesota
[01:10:14.020 --> 01:10:15.140]   when those riots occurred.
[01:10:15.140 --> 01:10:17.700]   He did not want to send in the National Guard,
[01:10:17.700 --> 01:10:18.580]   Trump did.
[01:10:18.580 --> 01:10:22.580]   And then Kamala Harris tried to raise money for bail
[01:10:22.580 --> 01:10:24.420]   for an organization that was bailing out
[01:10:24.420 --> 01:10:27.060]   some of these protesters and rioters out of prison.
[01:10:27.060 --> 01:10:29.300]   So if the media was so inclined,
[01:10:29.300 --> 01:10:31.460]   they could portray Kamala Harris and Tim Walz
[01:10:31.460 --> 01:10:35.140]   as the party of the riots of the summer of 2020.
[01:10:35.140 --> 01:10:37.300]   I think at the end of the day,
[01:10:37.300 --> 01:10:40.340]   that both those takes are propagandistic
[01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:43.060]   and they happened four years ago.
[01:10:43.060 --> 01:10:45.540]   And it's certainly a piece of information
[01:10:45.540 --> 01:10:47.540]   that voters can take into account,
[01:10:47.540 --> 01:10:49.300]   but it's only one piece of information.
[01:10:49.300 --> 01:10:51.540]   And there's a whole lot of other issues
[01:10:51.540 --> 01:10:53.620]   and policies in this election.
[01:10:53.620 --> 01:10:54.740]   And I think at this point,
[01:10:54.740 --> 01:10:56.100]   everything that happened four years ago
[01:10:56.100 --> 01:10:57.620]   is kind of priced into the stock.
[01:10:57.620 --> 01:10:59.460]   And what voters want to know about now
[01:10:59.460 --> 01:11:02.500]   is what would you do on the issues?
[01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:03.940]   What would you do about immigration?
[01:11:03.940 --> 01:11:05.460]   What would you do about inflation?
[01:11:05.460 --> 01:11:06.900]   What would you do about the economy?
[01:11:06.900 --> 01:11:10.180]   And when you look at the polling on those issues
[01:11:10.180 --> 01:11:11.700]   that voters say matter to them,
[01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:13.540]   Trump has a decisive advantage
[01:11:13.540 --> 01:11:15.140]   and Kamala Harris cannot explain
[01:11:15.140 --> 01:11:16.740]   what she would do differently than Joe Biden.
[01:11:16.740 --> 01:11:18.740]   - David Axelrod, word salad city.
[01:11:18.740 --> 01:11:19.780]   That's what he said last night,
[01:11:19.780 --> 01:11:21.620]   which was very shocking that he would say that.
[01:11:21.620 --> 01:11:23.940]   - Totally, that is throwing her under the bus,
[01:11:23.940 --> 01:11:26.420]   but it's also just preserving his own credibility
[01:11:26.420 --> 01:11:27.460]   because it's hard to look.
[01:11:27.460 --> 01:11:28.900]   - But this is my point.
[01:11:28.900 --> 01:11:31.860]   Anderson Cooper now has to preserve his own credibility.
[01:11:31.860 --> 01:11:33.940]   You can only prop up a candidate so long
[01:11:33.940 --> 01:11:34.980]   and then at some point
[01:11:34.980 --> 01:11:37.060]   you have to prioritize your own media career.
[01:11:37.060 --> 01:11:39.300]   And I think Anderson Cooper last night
[01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:40.420]   had to start to push back.
[01:11:40.420 --> 01:11:42.660]   - That's what, it's like when everyone turned on Biden.
[01:11:42.660 --> 01:11:43.700]   - Yeah, it's like he started-
[01:11:43.700 --> 01:11:44.660]   - Remember that one night
[01:11:44.660 --> 01:11:46.820]   when everyone turned on Biden after the debate,
[01:11:46.820 --> 01:11:50.420]   all the journalists who had been covering Biden for so long
[01:11:50.420 --> 01:11:52.260]   that it was obvious in their face the whole time,
[01:11:52.260 --> 01:11:53.620]   they suddenly had to be like,
[01:11:53.620 --> 01:11:56.500]   okay, I guess we got to admit now he's not really there.
[01:11:56.500 --> 01:12:00.020]   - Yeah, look, and I think in one important way,
[01:12:00.020 --> 01:12:01.780]   Kamala Harris has been set up to fail here
[01:12:01.780 --> 01:12:03.380]   because on the one hand,
[01:12:03.380 --> 01:12:06.820]   she wants to distance herself from Joe Biden's record.
[01:12:06.820 --> 01:12:07.620]   But on the other hand,
[01:12:07.620 --> 01:12:09.540]   she won't say what she would do differently.
[01:12:09.540 --> 01:12:11.780]   So she's in this kind of like never, neverland,
[01:12:11.780 --> 01:12:12.340]   this limbo.
[01:12:12.340 --> 01:12:13.220]   - Yeah, that's right.
[01:12:13.220 --> 01:12:14.900]   - But that's also not her fault.
[01:12:14.900 --> 01:12:17.380]   That's the position the Democratic Party put her in.
[01:12:17.380 --> 01:12:19.460]   And this goes back to what J-Cal said,
[01:12:19.460 --> 01:12:20.900]   we should have run a primary.
[01:12:20.900 --> 01:12:22.500]   - They should have run a primary for sure.
[01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:23.860]   I think they could have had a better candidate.
[01:12:23.860 --> 01:12:26.020]   But also I think to go back to Freeberg's question,
[01:12:26.020 --> 01:12:27.780]   this is a little bit of a pre-mortem,
[01:12:27.780 --> 01:12:28.980]   what should they have done differently?
[01:12:28.980 --> 01:12:31.700]   I think you either defend Joe Biden's record
[01:12:31.700 --> 01:12:33.300]   or say what you would do differently.
[01:12:33.300 --> 01:12:36.020]   You can't be in this limbo state.
[01:12:36.580 --> 01:12:39.220]   And Joe Biden's gotta be in the White House there
[01:12:39.220 --> 01:12:40.100]   and gritting his teeth,
[01:12:40.100 --> 01:12:42.820]   like wanting to get out on the campaign trail
[01:12:42.820 --> 01:12:44.100]   and defending his record.
[01:12:44.100 --> 01:12:46.500]   'Cause I think Joe Biden thinks he has a good record.
[01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:47.780]   And there are things you could say
[01:12:47.780 --> 01:12:48.740]   in favor of that record.
[01:12:48.740 --> 01:12:50.740]   I mean, I personally don't think it's great,
[01:12:50.740 --> 01:12:53.380]   but you could talk about the full employment picture.
[01:12:53.380 --> 01:12:54.820]   You could talk about the fact that yes,
[01:12:54.820 --> 01:12:56.660]   we had 9% inflation,
[01:12:56.660 --> 01:12:57.780]   but now it's down to 3%.
[01:12:57.780 --> 01:12:59.540]   I mean, there are things you could say.
[01:12:59.540 --> 01:13:00.660]   - Equity markets.
[01:13:00.660 --> 01:13:02.580]   - Equity markets are an all time high.
[01:13:02.580 --> 01:13:04.180]   I mean, he signed a lot of legislation
[01:13:04.180 --> 01:13:05.540]   that he obviously believed in.
[01:13:06.260 --> 01:13:08.820]   So the Democrats do have a record to run on.
[01:13:08.820 --> 01:13:10.900]   It's not a record that I personally believe in,
[01:13:10.900 --> 01:13:12.980]   but it's certainly one that I think
[01:13:12.980 --> 01:13:14.900]   you could make an effort to defend.
[01:13:14.900 --> 01:13:17.060]   And I think Biden, if he was the candidate,
[01:13:17.060 --> 01:13:18.740]   would be defending that record.
[01:13:18.740 --> 01:13:21.300]   And it's very awkward to have a candidate
[01:13:21.300 --> 01:13:22.900]   who was part of this administration
[01:13:22.900 --> 01:13:24.420]   who will not defend that record,
[01:13:24.420 --> 01:13:27.460]   who distances herself from that record,
[01:13:27.460 --> 01:13:30.340]   but won't really say with any detail or conviction
[01:13:30.340 --> 01:13:31.780]   what she would do differently.
[01:13:31.780 --> 01:13:33.620]   That is just a losing proposition.
[01:13:33.620 --> 01:13:35.380]   And I think Anderson Cooper exposed it
[01:13:35.380 --> 01:13:36.980]   more than Bret Baier last night,
[01:13:36.980 --> 01:13:38.660]   because Anderson Cooper had the time.
[01:13:38.660 --> 01:13:40.500]   Bret Baier only had 26 minutes
[01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:42.180]   and Bret Baier was seen as adversarial,
[01:13:42.180 --> 01:13:43.300]   whereas Anderson Cooper
[01:13:43.300 --> 01:13:46.020]   is fundamentally a friendly interviewer.
[01:13:46.020 --> 01:13:48.420]   And when she can't answer those questions
[01:13:48.420 --> 01:13:49.620]   for Anderson Cooper,
[01:13:49.620 --> 01:13:50.660]   that's when you know you're done.
[01:13:50.660 --> 01:13:53.060]   - By the way, we've said this now consistently,
[01:13:53.060 --> 01:13:56.500]   almost monotonously now
[01:13:56.500 --> 01:13:58.500]   for about two or three months.
[01:13:58.500 --> 01:14:01.300]   She has to go into these swing states
[01:14:01.300 --> 01:14:04.260]   and answer about four or five critical questions.
[01:14:05.140 --> 01:14:06.580]   And I would just say,
[01:14:06.580 --> 01:14:09.460]   this is still the problem.
[01:14:09.460 --> 01:14:12.020]   So if she wants to try to close this gap
[01:14:12.020 --> 01:14:13.060]   in the next 12 days
[01:14:13.060 --> 01:14:15.140]   and have a legitimate chance of winning,
[01:14:15.140 --> 01:14:17.700]   I think there's still 12 days.
[01:14:17.700 --> 01:14:21.060]   - I mean, it's a very simple way to do it.
[01:14:21.060 --> 01:14:23.780]   Number one, the border got out of control.
[01:14:23.780 --> 01:14:25.060]   We've shut it down already
[01:14:25.060 --> 01:14:26.500]   and we're gonna tighten it even more.
[01:14:26.500 --> 01:14:29.780]   Number two, the stock market's at a record for a reason.
[01:14:29.780 --> 01:14:32.900]   Number three, the employment is at the lowest
[01:14:32.900 --> 01:14:35.300]   it's ever been in our lifetimes.
[01:14:35.300 --> 01:14:37.460]   This is as good as it gets, folks.
[01:14:37.460 --> 01:14:38.900]   And if you go with the other guy-
[01:14:38.900 --> 01:14:43.140]   - Honestly, Jake, you're a better campaign manager
[01:14:43.140 --> 01:14:45.140]   than the person that's running the campaign right now.
[01:14:45.140 --> 01:14:48.180]   They're not doing a good job.
[01:14:48.180 --> 01:14:49.620]   And I think that Sachs is right.
[01:14:49.620 --> 01:14:51.540]   They're afraid of their own shadow
[01:14:51.540 --> 01:14:53.060]   and they're going to walk into
[01:14:53.060 --> 01:14:56.740]   a meaningful reset of the Democratic Party.
[01:14:56.740 --> 01:14:58.100]   - And let me even finish.
[01:14:58.100 --> 01:15:00.980]   Number four, this person overturned Roe v. Wade.
[01:15:00.980 --> 01:15:01.700]   - That's what they're doing.
[01:15:01.700 --> 01:15:04.340]   - And his VP candidate has said he wanted a national ban.
[01:15:04.340 --> 01:15:05.220]   They walked that back.
[01:15:05.220 --> 01:15:07.300]   But if you're a woman, you shouldn't trust them.
[01:15:07.300 --> 01:15:08.820]   And number five, obviously,
[01:15:08.820 --> 01:15:10.340]   you saw what happened on January 6th.
[01:15:10.340 --> 01:15:11.060]   He'll do it again.
[01:15:11.060 --> 01:15:11.300]   - You got the job, Jason.
[01:15:11.300 --> 01:15:13.220]   - And they just said that over and over.
[01:15:13.220 --> 01:15:14.260]   And listen, I'm not Biden.
[01:15:14.260 --> 01:15:16.660]   Biden obviously needs to retire.
[01:15:16.660 --> 01:15:17.620]   He was a great president.
[01:15:17.620 --> 01:15:18.580]   He was a great vice president.
[01:15:18.580 --> 01:15:19.620]   We thank him for his service.
[01:15:19.620 --> 01:15:20.420]   I'm completely different.
[01:15:20.420 --> 01:15:22.340]   I have a different approach to all of this.
[01:15:22.340 --> 01:15:24.340]   And Trump is a wild card
[01:15:24.340 --> 01:15:26.100]   that this country doesn't need at this time.
[01:15:26.100 --> 01:15:26.500]   The end.
[01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:30.900]   And they would win, but I don't know who's advising her.
[01:15:30.900 --> 01:15:31.860]   It's the same thing with Trump.
[01:15:31.860 --> 01:15:34.180]   I think Trump could have just gone right to the middle.
[01:15:34.180 --> 01:15:35.780]   And when he was Trump 2.0,
[01:15:35.780 --> 01:15:37.220]   he should be up 20 points on her.
[01:15:37.220 --> 01:15:39.860]   The fact that he's not up 20 points or 15 points
[01:15:39.860 --> 01:15:42.020]   on Kamala and that this is a dead heat,
[01:15:42.020 --> 01:15:43.060]   I think is crazy.
[01:15:43.060 --> 01:15:45.060]   Trump's the easiest candidate to beat.
[01:15:45.060 --> 01:15:46.420]   Kamala's the easiest candidate to beat.
[01:15:46.420 --> 01:15:48.340]   I wonder who's running both of these campaigns.
[01:15:48.340 --> 01:15:50.100]   - Well, it's hard to be up 20 points
[01:15:50.100 --> 01:15:51.940]   when the entire mainstream media is against you.
[01:15:51.940 --> 01:15:54.260]   There's only reporting positive things
[01:15:54.260 --> 01:15:55.620]   about the other candidates,
[01:15:55.620 --> 01:15:57.060]   only reporting negative things about you.
[01:15:57.060 --> 01:15:59.780]   And you have a three to one money disadvantage.
[01:16:00.500 --> 01:16:02.340]   One thing you could say for Kamala Harris
[01:16:02.340 --> 01:16:03.940]   is she has been a good fundraiser.
[01:16:03.940 --> 01:16:05.060]   There's plenty of billionaires
[01:16:05.060 --> 01:16:06.420]   who are funding her campaign.
[01:16:06.420 --> 01:16:08.100]   They literally have three times more money
[01:16:08.100 --> 01:16:10.020]   than the Trump campaign.
[01:16:10.020 --> 01:16:13.060]   And even in California, which is a safe state for them,
[01:16:13.060 --> 01:16:15.380]   you're seeing Kamala campaign ads everywhere.
[01:16:15.380 --> 01:16:17.460]   That just tells you they're so flush with cash
[01:16:17.460 --> 01:16:19.140]   that they can afford to spread the money around
[01:16:19.140 --> 01:16:20.420]   even in California.
[01:16:20.420 --> 01:16:22.980]   So look, the reality is that Trump
[01:16:22.980 --> 01:16:25.700]   has the entire establishment against him.
[01:16:25.700 --> 01:16:28.660]   And I think for him to be ahead in the polls
[01:16:28.660 --> 01:16:29.860]   and the prediction markets
[01:16:29.860 --> 01:16:31.860]   and the early voting fairly decisively
[01:16:31.860 --> 01:16:33.940]   is an extraordinary achievement.
[01:16:33.940 --> 01:16:36.660]   I think he's probably the only candidate
[01:16:36.660 --> 01:16:37.540]   who could have done that.
[01:16:37.540 --> 01:16:41.220]   In any event, and I do think, J. Cal,
[01:16:41.220 --> 01:16:43.860]   that Kamala has tried to make some of the arguments
[01:16:43.860 --> 01:16:46.100]   that you just said, not very crisply,
[01:16:46.100 --> 01:16:48.180]   but she's trying to walk back on the border.
[01:16:48.180 --> 01:16:50.260]   The problem is they have no credibility on that
[01:16:50.260 --> 01:16:52.660]   because the Democrats for the last eight years
[01:16:52.660 --> 01:16:54.820]   have fought Trump on the border wall.
[01:16:54.820 --> 01:16:56.500]   It's his signature issue.
[01:16:56.500 --> 01:16:57.780]   And if you don't think Republicans
[01:16:57.780 --> 01:16:59.060]   should be believed on abortion,
[01:16:59.060 --> 01:17:00.500]   there's absolutely no reason
[01:17:00.500 --> 01:17:02.820]   to believe Democrats on the border.
[01:17:02.820 --> 01:17:04.180]   They fought Trump's wall.
[01:17:04.180 --> 01:17:05.060]   Yeah, I think that's fair.
[01:17:05.060 --> 01:17:07.940]   They sold parts of it all for scrap metal.
[01:17:07.940 --> 01:17:09.300]   She was supposed to be the border czar,
[01:17:09.300 --> 01:17:10.660]   didn't even visit the border,
[01:17:10.660 --> 01:17:12.500]   which shows that she never thought it was important.
[01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:14.900]   Now she wants to pretend that she's Trump on the border.
[01:17:14.900 --> 01:17:15.860]   Public's not buying it.
[01:17:15.860 --> 01:17:17.220]   To handle the border is just so simple.
[01:17:17.220 --> 01:17:18.100]   She could just say,
[01:17:18.100 --> 01:17:19.700]   "What worked then is not going to work now.
[01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:21.620]   We've filled up."
[01:17:21.620 --> 01:17:23.780]   And Trudeau just did a tweet.
[01:17:23.780 --> 01:17:25.540]   "Hey, we're taking a pause for two years."
[01:17:25.540 --> 01:17:26.420]   That's all she's got to do.
[01:17:26.420 --> 01:17:28.100]   "We're taking a pause for two years on the border.
[01:17:28.100 --> 01:17:29.940]   We obviously, it got out of control."
[01:17:29.940 --> 01:17:30.660]   The end.
[01:17:30.660 --> 01:17:31.860]   We'll move on to the next issue.
[01:17:31.860 --> 01:17:33.060]   All right.
[01:17:33.060 --> 01:17:34.900]   If the Harris campaign is listening,
[01:17:34.900 --> 01:17:36.420]   Jekyll's advice is out there.
[01:17:36.420 --> 01:17:38.020]   You may come on the pod.
[01:17:38.020 --> 01:17:38.980]   You're always welcome.
[01:17:38.980 --> 01:17:41.460]   Everyone that's running for president
[01:17:41.460 --> 01:17:42.260]   is welcome on the pod.
[01:17:42.260 --> 01:17:44.020]   Sorry, did you guys hear this rumor that Barstool Sports--
[01:17:44.020 --> 01:17:45.380]   She's not my candidate, by the way.
[01:17:45.380 --> 01:17:46.340]   She's not my candidate.
[01:17:46.340 --> 01:17:48.500]   Did you guys hear this rumor that Barstool Sports
[01:17:48.500 --> 01:17:51.300]   was asked if they would interview her
[01:17:51.300 --> 01:17:52.420]   and they turned her down?
[01:17:52.420 --> 01:17:54.100]   Is that, is this rumor true?
[01:17:54.100 --> 01:17:54.820]   Apparently.
[01:17:54.820 --> 01:17:55.700]   I don't know.
[01:17:55.700 --> 01:17:56.820]   Why wouldn't they take it?
[01:17:56.820 --> 01:17:58.180]   No, they would take the interview.
[01:17:58.180 --> 01:18:00.900]   So Portnoy claims that the Harris campaign
[01:18:00.900 --> 01:18:02.260]   reached out and asked to be on
[01:18:02.260 --> 01:18:03.460]   two or three of their shows
[01:18:03.460 --> 01:18:07.220]   and Barstool declined having her on,
[01:18:07.220 --> 01:18:09.700]   which is pretty unbelievable.
[01:18:09.700 --> 01:18:11.300]   Well, they just waited way too late.
[01:18:11.300 --> 01:18:13.060]   I mean, there's no question that last month,
[01:18:13.060 --> 01:18:15.380]   they radically pivoted their media strategy.
[01:18:15.380 --> 01:18:17.300]   She became the candidate roughly three months ago.
[01:18:17.300 --> 01:18:18.580]   For the first two months,
[01:18:18.580 --> 01:18:20.260]   they didn't let her do any press interviews.
[01:18:20.260 --> 01:18:22.100]   Then they realized that their internals were bad.
[01:18:22.100 --> 01:18:23.220]   They're behind in the polls.
[01:18:23.220 --> 01:18:24.420]   So now they're having her go out
[01:18:24.420 --> 01:18:26.260]   and do a lot of media.
[01:18:26.260 --> 01:18:27.860]   And like I said, a couple of weeks ago,
[01:18:27.860 --> 01:18:29.300]   that started to create a doom loop
[01:18:29.300 --> 01:18:32.020]   because she is not a great media performer.
[01:18:32.020 --> 01:18:34.100]   So her polls started getting even worse.
[01:18:34.100 --> 01:18:36.500]   So then they got to put her out on more media
[01:18:36.500 --> 01:18:38.500]   to try and, you know, rebut that.
[01:18:38.500 --> 01:18:39.860]   Your doom loop was a good call.
[01:18:39.860 --> 01:18:41.780]   I'll give you credit.
[01:18:41.780 --> 01:18:43.220]   If the Kamala campaign were a startup,
[01:18:43.220 --> 01:18:44.980]   we'd be saying it's in a death spiral right now.
[01:18:44.980 --> 01:18:46.740]   Okay, got it.
[01:18:46.740 --> 01:18:47.460]   You got here long.
[01:18:47.460 --> 01:18:48.820]   Let's move on.
[01:18:48.820 --> 01:18:49.780]   It's a dead heat.
[01:18:49.780 --> 01:18:50.180]   We got it.
[01:18:50.180 --> 01:18:50.820]   Let's go.
[01:18:50.820 --> 01:18:53.700]   So we're going to wrap up with Starbees.
[01:18:53.700 --> 01:18:54.980]   What I think is a pretty...
[01:18:54.980 --> 01:18:56.980]   Yeah, Starbees, super interesting topic
[01:18:56.980 --> 01:18:58.980]   because it's a real question around
[01:18:58.980 --> 01:19:01.620]   traditional shifting to digital.
[01:19:01.620 --> 01:19:03.780]   Is that why Starbucks is having challenges?
[01:19:03.780 --> 01:19:05.620]   Or is it just maturity?
[01:19:05.620 --> 01:19:07.380]   Or is it what happens when a brand
[01:19:07.380 --> 01:19:09.700]   that's successful as a luxury brand gets too big?
[01:19:09.700 --> 01:19:12.900]   And the kind of, you know,
[01:19:12.900 --> 01:19:14.820]   premium experience commoditizes.
[01:19:14.820 --> 01:19:16.100]   So as you guys know,
[01:19:16.100 --> 01:19:18.100]   we covered the Starbucks CEO,
[01:19:18.100 --> 01:19:20.900]   Brian Nickel joining a few months ago.
[01:19:20.900 --> 01:19:22.660]   This was after the prior CEO had been
[01:19:22.660 --> 01:19:25.460]   in the office for just 16 months.
[01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:27.860]   And there were a lot of problems
[01:19:27.860 --> 01:19:29.460]   that were plaguing Starbucks.
[01:19:29.460 --> 01:19:31.220]   But just this Tuesday,
[01:19:31.220 --> 01:19:32.820]   Brian Nickel came on and said
[01:19:32.820 --> 01:19:36.020]   that we're suspending guidance for 2025
[01:19:36.020 --> 01:19:38.580]   after reporting preliminary earnings
[01:19:38.580 --> 01:19:41.860]   that showed another drop in sales at Starbucks.
[01:19:41.860 --> 01:19:42.900]   Same store sales,
[01:19:42.900 --> 01:19:46.180]   which is the key metric in the QSR
[01:19:46.180 --> 01:19:49.220]   or food and beverage retail business.
[01:19:50.100 --> 01:19:52.340]   It tracks what your revenue is year over year.
[01:19:52.340 --> 01:19:56.260]   Same store sales declined 7% year over year.
[01:19:56.260 --> 01:20:00.260]   Earnings per share dropped 25% year over year.
[01:20:00.260 --> 01:20:00.820]   So Nickel said,
[01:20:00.820 --> 01:20:02.500]   "We're getting the bad news out of the way.
[01:20:02.500 --> 01:20:05.140]   Now we're going to this back to Starbucks plan,
[01:20:05.140 --> 01:20:06.420]   focus on experience,
[01:20:06.420 --> 01:20:08.340]   improve the throughput experience and quality,
[01:20:08.340 --> 01:20:10.660]   make baristas choose Starbucks as a career."
[01:20:10.660 --> 01:20:11.700]   And then he went through a whole plan.
[01:20:11.700 --> 01:20:13.620]   He put out a six, seven minute video
[01:20:13.620 --> 01:20:14.820]   on this whole thing.
[01:20:14.820 --> 01:20:17.380]   So clearly customers are frustrated
[01:20:17.380 --> 01:20:18.740]   with the Starbucks product,
[01:20:18.740 --> 01:20:20.420]   the Starbucks experience,
[01:20:20.420 --> 01:20:22.980]   the employees are frustrated working there.
[01:20:22.980 --> 01:20:26.180]   And a lot of the system seems to be breaking down.
[01:20:26.180 --> 01:20:28.100]   I guess I wanted to kind of talk about
[01:20:28.100 --> 01:20:29.220]   what is the core driver
[01:20:29.220 --> 01:20:31.700]   and is there a business lesson in all of this
[01:20:31.700 --> 01:20:32.900]   about premium brands
[01:20:32.900 --> 01:20:35.380]   or about scale and maturity in markets
[01:20:35.380 --> 01:20:37.780]   to be learned from the Starbucks story?
[01:20:37.780 --> 01:20:38.980]   So I don't know if any of you guys
[01:20:38.980 --> 01:20:40.180]   have gone through this earnings report
[01:20:40.180 --> 01:20:41.300]   or looked at the Nickel video.
[01:20:41.300 --> 01:20:44.660]   I go to Starbucks on regular
[01:20:44.660 --> 01:20:46.180]   and I think this really is just
[01:20:46.180 --> 01:20:48.420]   a case of founder versus bean counter.
[01:20:48.420 --> 01:20:49.940]   It reminds me of Boeing
[01:20:49.940 --> 01:20:52.420]   or even Apple with their inability
[01:20:52.420 --> 01:20:53.780]   to produce new products
[01:20:53.780 --> 01:20:57.140]   post the Steve Jobs pipeline of products.
[01:20:57.140 --> 01:20:58.980]   And if you have anybody read
[01:20:58.980 --> 01:21:00.340]   "Pour Your Heart Into It,"
[01:21:00.340 --> 01:21:01.700]   Schultz's biography,
[01:21:01.700 --> 01:21:03.700]   it's absolutely fantastic.
[01:21:03.700 --> 01:21:05.220]   And he really had an obsession
[01:21:05.220 --> 01:21:06.420]   with user experience,
[01:21:06.420 --> 01:21:09.140]   like writing people's names on the cups
[01:21:09.140 --> 01:21:10.900]   was a Starbucks innovation.
[01:21:10.900 --> 01:21:12.660]   Remembering people's names,
[01:21:12.660 --> 01:21:14.260]   empowering the green aprons
[01:21:14.260 --> 01:21:15.940]   was like a big part of this.
[01:21:15.940 --> 01:21:17.140]   And then once he was at it
[01:21:17.140 --> 01:21:18.740]   and the bean counters came in
[01:21:18.740 --> 01:21:20.420]   and they just got all about efficiency.
[01:21:20.420 --> 01:21:23.220]   The much smaller number of baristas
[01:21:23.220 --> 01:21:23.780]   at the store,
[01:21:23.780 --> 01:21:26.500]   ordering your drink through the app
[01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:28.100]   and just trying to make these
[01:21:28.100 --> 01:21:30.100]   grind it efficiency decisions
[01:21:30.100 --> 01:21:31.780]   as opposed to the experience ones.
[01:21:31.780 --> 01:21:34.340]   And I think the Starbucks experience
[01:21:34.340 --> 01:21:35.780]   starts and begins with the baristas
[01:21:35.780 --> 01:21:36.900]   and that's the main problem.
[01:21:36.900 --> 01:21:38.260]   If you've gone to a Starbucks
[01:21:38.260 --> 01:21:39.300]   over the last couple of years,
[01:21:39.300 --> 01:21:40.180]   sometimes you go in
[01:21:40.180 --> 01:21:43.060]   and there are literally 50 drinks from the,
[01:21:43.060 --> 01:21:44.420]   like, I'm not kidding,
[01:21:44.420 --> 01:21:47.700]   like 50 drinks on the pickup counter.
[01:21:47.700 --> 01:21:49.220]   And then this huge line,
[01:21:49.220 --> 01:21:50.340]   if you come in person,
[01:21:50.340 --> 01:21:52.340]   and it's the most impersonal thing
[01:21:52.340 --> 01:21:54.100]   and the stores are a wreck.
[01:21:54.100 --> 01:21:54.820]   They're disgusting.
[01:21:54.820 --> 01:21:56.420]   They look like a truck stop.
[01:21:56.420 --> 01:21:57.940]   And the whole point of Starbucks
[01:21:57.940 --> 01:21:59.300]   was to create this third space,
[01:21:59.300 --> 01:22:01.140]   this beautiful place that was welcoming
[01:22:01.140 --> 01:22:02.660]   with gorgeous lighting.
[01:22:02.660 --> 01:22:05.060]   And the baristas was supposed to make you hang out
[01:22:05.060 --> 01:22:06.820]   and enjoy yourself there.
[01:22:06.820 --> 01:22:08.260]   And they lost that.
[01:22:08.260 --> 01:22:10.900]   And all you have to do is read Schultz's book
[01:22:10.900 --> 01:22:12.100]   and do exactly what he did.
[01:22:12.100 --> 01:22:13.780]   Now, there are a lot of other issues there.
[01:22:14.660 --> 01:22:17.940]   Around the competition for Starbucks employees
[01:22:17.940 --> 01:22:19.220]   that I think are super important.
[01:22:19.220 --> 01:22:21.060]   - Do you think that's really true Jake Alp?
[01:22:21.060 --> 01:22:22.500]   Because like Nickel came on
[01:22:22.500 --> 01:22:24.180]   and he said, we're going back to the core,
[01:22:24.180 --> 01:22:27.300]   flat whites, espressos, nice espressos,
[01:22:27.300 --> 01:22:28.500]   delicious coffee.
[01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:29.780]   But the reality is
[01:22:29.780 --> 01:22:31.380]   in order for them to have grown revenue
[01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:32.900]   over the last 20 years,
[01:22:32.900 --> 01:22:34.740]   Starbucks has expanded their menu
[01:22:34.740 --> 01:22:36.260]   as Chamath has pointed out
[01:22:36.260 --> 01:22:38.100]   to becoming a seller of sugar.
[01:22:38.100 --> 01:22:40.020]   They've become a seller of milkshakes
[01:22:40.020 --> 01:22:41.300]   and flavored beverages
[01:22:41.300 --> 01:22:43.780]   and high sugar cocktails, mocktails
[01:22:43.780 --> 01:22:45.540]   that people run into the store
[01:22:45.540 --> 01:22:46.820]   to buy two, three times a day.
[01:22:46.820 --> 01:22:48.660]   That's how they were able to get the pickup
[01:22:48.660 --> 01:22:50.420]   not selling what they started out doing,
[01:22:50.420 --> 01:22:52.900]   which was fine Italian roast at espresso.
[01:22:52.900 --> 01:22:55.780]   It's now become a very different product
[01:22:55.780 --> 01:22:57.540]   and a very different experience.
[01:22:57.540 --> 01:22:59.380]   And so can you really go back to the core
[01:22:59.380 --> 01:23:01.220]   and not lose all the customers
[01:23:01.220 --> 01:23:02.340]   that I would say aren't looking
[01:23:02.340 --> 01:23:03.860]   for a flat white and an espresso.
[01:23:03.860 --> 01:23:05.300]   They're looking for a milkshake in the middle of the day.
[01:23:05.300 --> 01:23:07.300]   - I think you want to maintain the core is the key.
[01:23:07.300 --> 01:23:08.580]   You don't want to give up the core.
[01:23:08.580 --> 01:23:11.300]   And the core was having a great in-store experience.
[01:23:11.300 --> 01:23:13.700]   And I think that is not what you get
[01:23:13.700 --> 01:23:14.500]   when you go there.
[01:23:14.500 --> 01:23:15.620]   Putting the sugar aside,
[01:23:15.620 --> 01:23:19.460]   it is, I think like going for ice cream for kids.
[01:23:19.460 --> 01:23:20.980]   So my kids will pick
[01:23:20.980 --> 01:23:23.060]   if they want to go for ice cream or Starbucks.
[01:23:23.060 --> 01:23:24.820]   And to your point about the sugar Chamath,
[01:23:24.820 --> 01:23:26.260]   it's basically the same profile.
[01:23:26.260 --> 01:23:29.140]   And it's a great place to get breakfast.
[01:23:29.140 --> 01:23:30.020]   I'll tell you that, you know,
[01:23:30.020 --> 01:23:31.140]   the egg bites and the scones.
[01:23:31.140 --> 01:23:33.780]   - Let's watch Nichols clip and then Chamath,
[01:23:33.780 --> 01:23:35.620]   you can give us your take on this.
[01:23:35.620 --> 01:23:37.620]   This is a 30 second clip from Nichols,
[01:23:37.620 --> 01:23:39.620]   six minutes that he put out on Twitter.
[01:23:39.620 --> 01:23:43.300]   - To succeed, we need to address staffing in our stores,
[01:23:43.300 --> 01:23:46.820]   remove bottlenecks and simplify things for our baristas.
[01:23:46.820 --> 01:23:48.820]   We need to refine mobile order and pay
[01:23:48.820 --> 01:23:50.980]   so it doesn't overwhelm the cafe experience.
[01:23:50.980 --> 01:23:52.900]   We're fundamentally changing our marketing.
[01:23:52.900 --> 01:23:55.700]   We've been focusing on Starbucks rewards customers
[01:23:55.700 --> 01:23:57.780]   rather than talking to all our customers.
[01:23:57.780 --> 01:23:59.300]   And we're changing that quickly.
[01:23:59.300 --> 01:24:01.860]   We will simplify our overly complex menu,
[01:24:01.860 --> 01:24:03.620]   fix our pricing architecture
[01:24:03.620 --> 01:24:05.700]   and ensure that every customer feels Starbucks
[01:24:05.700 --> 01:24:07.460]   is worth it every single time.
[01:24:07.460 --> 01:24:08.260]   They visit.
[01:24:08.260 --> 01:24:12.180]   We must reestablish ourselves as the community coffee house.
[01:24:12.180 --> 01:24:13.380]   - By the way, this is one of the things
[01:24:13.380 --> 01:24:17.140]   that Nichols did at Taco Bell when he was the CEO there.
[01:24:17.140 --> 01:24:18.660]   You guys remember the Taco Bell menu?
[01:24:18.660 --> 01:24:21.140]   There was always like really interesting hidden things
[01:24:21.140 --> 01:24:21.620]   on that menu.
[01:24:21.620 --> 01:24:23.860]   He simplified the menu, made it very small,
[01:24:23.860 --> 01:24:25.540]   did the same at Chipotle.
[01:24:25.540 --> 01:24:28.100]   He takes this approach of finding the best product,
[01:24:28.100 --> 01:24:30.580]   simplifying the experience, simplifying the operations
[01:24:30.580 --> 01:24:33.300]   and giving the customers fewer choices
[01:24:33.300 --> 01:24:35.940]   that ultimately leads to faster turnaround,
[01:24:35.940 --> 01:24:36.820]   better experience.
[01:24:36.820 --> 01:24:42.100]   But the trade-off is you have less variety
[01:24:42.100 --> 01:24:43.780]   that people have come to know and love.
[01:24:43.780 --> 01:24:45.220]   And at Starbucks in particular,
[01:24:45.220 --> 01:24:48.100]   where there is just so much variety to choose from now,
[01:24:48.100 --> 01:24:50.660]   if your favorite beverage got pulled off the menu,
[01:24:50.660 --> 01:24:52.420]   are you gonna start to go there less frequently?
[01:24:52.420 --> 01:24:54.580]   Chamath, I don't know if you have a take
[01:24:54.580 --> 01:24:55.700]   on what's going on at Starbucks
[01:24:55.700 --> 01:24:58.100]   and whether it tells you something about the maturity
[01:24:58.100 --> 01:25:00.420]   about one of the most iconic consumer brands in America.
[01:25:00.420 --> 01:25:03.380]   - This business is in trouble.
[01:25:03.380 --> 01:25:06.020]   Nick, please show the chart.
[01:25:06.020 --> 01:25:08.500]   This is Eli Lilly versus Starbucks.
[01:25:08.500 --> 01:25:09.780]   If you look at it over a year,
[01:25:09.780 --> 01:25:12.820]   you could look at it over the year to date.
[01:25:12.820 --> 01:25:14.420]   You could look at it over two years.
[01:25:14.420 --> 01:25:15.380]   - Five years.
[01:25:15.380 --> 01:25:16.900]   - Five years.
[01:25:16.900 --> 01:25:17.860]   - Look at that.
[01:25:17.860 --> 01:25:19.140]   - But what does this show?
[01:25:19.140 --> 01:25:22.900]   This shows sugar versus anti-sugar.
[01:25:22.900 --> 01:25:26.340]   And anti-sugar is winning.
[01:25:26.340 --> 01:25:28.340]   Say it differently.
[01:25:28.340 --> 01:25:34.820]   GLP-1s versus things that cause you to need GLP-1s.
[01:25:35.620 --> 01:25:36.820]   GLP-1s are winning.
[01:25:36.820 --> 01:25:41.220]   And so I think this existential issue for Starbucks
[01:25:41.220 --> 01:25:44.820]   is about resetting to a much smaller footprint
[01:25:44.820 --> 01:25:46.660]   and a different product portfolio
[01:25:46.660 --> 01:25:50.180]   that tries to see where the puck is going.
[01:25:50.180 --> 01:25:51.300]   Where the puck is going
[01:25:51.300 --> 01:25:53.300]   is where a large percentage of the people
[01:25:53.300 --> 01:25:59.460]   that probably were buying Starbucks products
[01:25:59.460 --> 01:26:01.540]   and were very loyal Starbucks customers
[01:26:01.540 --> 01:26:04.820]   will have very different consumption habits
[01:26:04.820 --> 01:26:09.300]   as they more pervasively use these GLP-1s.
[01:26:09.300 --> 01:26:12.500]   And this in a nutshell is not something
[01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:14.900]   that Starbucks can fix with their current product mix.
[01:26:14.900 --> 01:26:19.060]   And so I think that they're fighting into a headwind
[01:26:19.060 --> 01:26:24.660]   and these other companies are deeply incentivized
[01:26:24.660 --> 01:26:28.900]   to get American taste buds to be different.
[01:26:28.900 --> 01:26:32.020]   And so Jason, the things that you talked about
[01:26:32.020 --> 01:26:33.460]   are exactly the things that I think
[01:26:33.460 --> 01:26:36.500]   start to fall off the menu or just don't sell as much.
[01:26:36.500 --> 01:26:38.420]   Because whatever the population of Americans
[01:26:38.420 --> 01:26:41.620]   are that are on GLP-1s, let's say it's single digits,
[01:26:41.620 --> 01:26:42.980]   the real question is what percentage
[01:26:42.980 --> 01:26:45.060]   of Starbucks customers are on these things.
[01:26:45.060 --> 01:26:47.220]   And I think it's probably much more than single digits.
[01:26:47.220 --> 01:26:48.500]   And this is why I think you see
[01:26:48.500 --> 01:26:51.220]   the continuous decline in same store sales.
[01:26:51.220 --> 01:26:54.580]   And I think if you start to graph
[01:26:54.580 --> 01:26:57.380]   the adoption of GLP-1s pervasively in America
[01:26:57.380 --> 01:26:59.620]   to the drop in same store sales,
[01:26:59.620 --> 01:27:02.180]   I think as GLP-1 adoption goes up,
[01:27:02.180 --> 01:27:03.860]   same store sales will continue to go down.
[01:27:03.860 --> 01:27:05.620]   - But doesn't it argue towards
[01:27:05.620 --> 01:27:07.220]   the original business, Freeberg,
[01:27:07.220 --> 01:27:09.380]   that going there and having a cup of coffee
[01:27:09.380 --> 01:27:11.460]   and hanging out leisurely with your friends
[01:27:11.460 --> 01:27:14.020]   and having a conversation and it being a third space
[01:27:14.020 --> 01:27:16.980]   is the core value prop and maybe the sugary drinks
[01:27:16.980 --> 01:27:18.980]   maybe will fall out of fashion.
[01:27:18.980 --> 01:27:21.460]   - So it may be true, but I think that
[01:27:21.460 --> 01:27:26.980]   the core objective of any corporation
[01:27:26.980 --> 01:27:29.140]   is to maximize shareholder value
[01:27:29.140 --> 01:27:30.900]   driven by growing profits over time.
[01:27:31.540 --> 01:27:32.980]   So growing profits over time
[01:27:32.980 --> 01:27:34.740]   requires increasing your revenue.
[01:27:34.740 --> 01:27:37.860]   And there are three levers for doing this.
[01:27:37.860 --> 01:27:40.580]   Maximize brand, which is to get more customers.
[01:27:40.580 --> 01:27:43.380]   And I don't know if you can get the brand
[01:27:43.380 --> 01:27:45.540]   to be any more maximal than Starbucks.
[01:27:45.540 --> 01:27:47.860]   Maximize coverage, which is how many products
[01:27:47.860 --> 01:27:49.860]   can you get those customers to buy,
[01:27:49.860 --> 01:27:51.060]   whether it's on a daily basis,
[01:27:51.060 --> 01:27:52.340]   weekly basis or monthly basis.
[01:27:52.340 --> 01:27:55.700]   How much of their meals and wallet share are you getting?
[01:27:55.700 --> 01:27:56.820]   And I don't know how many more times
[01:27:56.820 --> 01:27:58.820]   you can get people to go back into Starbucks each week
[01:27:58.820 --> 01:28:00.340]   than they've done with their rewards program,
[01:28:00.340 --> 01:28:02.420]   with their digital, with their high throughput tools
[01:28:02.420 --> 01:28:04.340]   that they've built over the last decade and so on.
[01:28:04.340 --> 01:28:05.780]   And then finally maximize price.
[01:28:05.780 --> 01:28:07.940]   There's a limit to how much you can charge people.
[01:28:07.940 --> 01:28:09.140]   When you put those three together,
[01:28:09.140 --> 01:28:11.300]   you got more customers, you're selling them more stuff
[01:28:11.300 --> 01:28:12.980]   at the highest price possible.
[01:28:12.980 --> 01:28:15.220]   At some point you reach a revenue maximum.
[01:28:15.220 --> 01:28:17.940]   That has happened also at Apple.
[01:28:17.940 --> 01:28:20.180]   I think that Apple has faced a similar dilemma
[01:28:20.180 --> 01:28:21.140]   in the last couple of years,
[01:28:21.140 --> 01:28:22.500]   which is how do we get more customers?
[01:28:22.500 --> 01:28:24.580]   It's the most recognized brand on earth.
[01:28:24.580 --> 01:28:26.820]   You can only buy so many Apple products now.
[01:28:26.820 --> 01:28:28.980]   They tried to launch the Vision Pro, it didn't go well.
[01:28:28.980 --> 01:28:30.340]   Today they announced that they're, this week
[01:28:30.340 --> 01:28:32.340]   they announced they're discontinuing production
[01:28:32.340 --> 01:28:33.860]   or reducing production on the Vision Pro.
[01:28:33.860 --> 01:28:36.900]   And you can only charge so much for these products.
[01:28:36.900 --> 01:28:39.540]   And I would argue that Starbucks is a victim
[01:28:39.540 --> 01:28:41.700]   of the same maximization effect.
[01:28:41.700 --> 01:28:43.940]   That at some point you get all the customers,
[01:28:43.940 --> 01:28:45.540]   you get them to come in and spend,
[01:28:45.540 --> 01:28:47.380]   buy as many products from you as they can,
[01:28:47.380 --> 01:28:49.540]   and you charge them the highest price possible.
[01:28:49.540 --> 01:28:51.460]   And then you reach this kind of maximum point
[01:28:51.460 --> 01:28:52.660]   on the business.
[01:28:52.660 --> 01:28:54.100]   And I think Starbucks has just reached
[01:28:54.100 --> 01:28:55.620]   that point of maturity.
[01:28:55.620 --> 01:28:57.540]   So to your point, it doesn't mean
[01:28:57.540 --> 01:28:59.140]   that it's a bad business at all.
[01:28:59.140 --> 01:29:00.340]   It could be a great business,
[01:29:00.340 --> 01:29:02.020]   a nicely profitable business,
[01:29:02.020 --> 01:29:04.180]   but the growth ahead of it is limited.
[01:29:04.180 --> 01:29:06.100]   It cannot keep growing same store sales
[01:29:06.100 --> 01:29:08.500]   as it has historically because they've maximized
[01:29:08.500 --> 01:29:09.940]   all three of those levers.
[01:29:09.940 --> 01:29:13.140]   So fewer costs might be a way to drive more profits,
[01:29:13.140 --> 01:29:14.740]   more efficient operations.
[01:29:14.740 --> 01:29:16.500]   I think that's the natural next state
[01:29:16.500 --> 01:29:18.260]   for Nickel to tackle at this company.
[01:29:18.260 --> 01:29:20.820]   - The sad thing for Starbucks is that the only road
[01:29:20.820 --> 01:29:23.300]   that they have is to actually double down on sugar.
[01:29:23.300 --> 01:29:26.420]   And the reason is because the ARPUs
[01:29:26.420 --> 01:29:28.340]   are meaningfully higher than traditional coffee.
[01:29:28.340 --> 01:29:31.060]   And so the economic pressure
[01:29:31.060 --> 01:29:32.500]   that shareholders will put on it
[01:29:32.500 --> 01:29:34.500]   is to actually stay in the business that they're in
[01:29:34.500 --> 01:29:37.300]   and try to do it as long as possible,
[01:29:37.300 --> 01:29:38.260]   as you say, Freeberg,
[01:29:38.260 --> 01:29:40.100]   and just strip out as much cash as possible.
[01:29:40.100 --> 01:29:41.700]   - And then you just, you grow profit
[01:29:41.700 --> 01:29:43.540]   by reducing costs and getting more efficient
[01:29:43.540 --> 01:29:45.700]   versus trying to add more products
[01:29:45.700 --> 01:29:46.340]   to get more customers.
[01:29:46.340 --> 01:29:47.540]   - Which degrades the experience.
[01:29:47.540 --> 01:29:49.540]   - But the structural problem is Starbucks
[01:29:49.540 --> 01:29:51.540]   should be probably a $20 billion asset.
[01:29:51.540 --> 01:29:53.140]   - Yeah, and so what happens when a company
[01:29:53.140 --> 01:29:54.420]   gets to this level of maturity,
[01:29:54.420 --> 01:29:55.860]   much like has happened with Apple,
[01:29:55.860 --> 01:29:56.900]   is the multiples compress.
[01:29:56.900 --> 01:29:58.100]   - No, the difference is though
[01:29:58.100 --> 01:30:00.100]   that Apple has not had the competitive pressure
[01:30:00.100 --> 01:30:00.900]   that Starbucks has,
[01:30:00.900 --> 01:30:03.700]   because Starbucks competes on a level playing field
[01:30:03.700 --> 01:30:05.300]   with the Dunkin' Donuts of the world
[01:30:05.300 --> 01:30:06.980]   or the Pete's Coffees of the world,
[01:30:06.980 --> 01:30:10.340]   but they compete in a completely orthogonal plane
[01:30:10.340 --> 01:30:11.380]   with GLP-1s.
[01:30:11.380 --> 01:30:14.420]   And I think that is not something that Apple deals with.
[01:30:14.420 --> 01:30:16.740]   So Apple can still be at the point
[01:30:16.740 --> 01:30:17.860]   that you described earlier,
[01:30:17.860 --> 01:30:20.180]   which is let me just maximize free cash for generation,
[01:30:20.180 --> 01:30:21.380]   which is what they do.
[01:30:21.380 --> 01:30:23.460]   And then let me allocate that back to shareholders
[01:30:23.460 --> 01:30:25.380]   via buybacks, which is also what they do.
[01:30:25.860 --> 01:30:27.940]   So there could be another decade or so
[01:30:27.940 --> 01:30:29.540]   where Apple can continue to run this play
[01:30:29.540 --> 01:30:32.820]   with very little impact to them or to the company.
[01:30:32.820 --> 01:30:35.380]   Now, I'll say something else about Apple though,
[01:30:35.380 --> 01:30:37.620]   which is I actually upgraded my phone.
[01:30:37.620 --> 01:30:40.980]   I think this was three years in and I finally did it.
[01:30:40.980 --> 01:30:43.220]   My gosh, this phone is, sucks.
[01:30:43.220 --> 01:30:47.700]   - iOS 18 software is janky.
[01:30:47.700 --> 01:30:49.860]   - iOS 18 is just terrible.
[01:30:49.860 --> 01:30:52.100]   I'll show you one example of just like terrible design
[01:30:52.100 --> 01:30:54.980]   where if a designer that worked on my team showed me this,
[01:30:54.980 --> 01:30:55.780]   I would have fired them.
[01:30:55.780 --> 01:30:56.500]   Look at this.
[01:30:56.500 --> 01:30:57.540]   Can you see this?
[01:30:57.540 --> 01:31:00.740]   Is it possible to understand why you have two images
[01:31:00.740 --> 01:31:02.580]   for the do not disturb thing?
[01:31:02.580 --> 01:31:04.020]   One above the other.
[01:31:04.020 --> 01:31:05.960]   - I had a broken one of those too.
[01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:10.180]   - No, but it's a level of sloppiness and not taking care,
[01:31:10.180 --> 01:31:12.820]   which just shows you that it's like,
[01:31:12.820 --> 01:31:14.420]   we make so much money.
[01:31:14.420 --> 01:31:15.780]   It just doesn't matter anymore.
[01:31:15.780 --> 01:31:17.380]   That's what I feel like they're telling me.
[01:31:17.380 --> 01:31:19.620]   And then I'm like, well, wait a minute.
[01:31:19.620 --> 01:31:22.420]   Why did I just spend $1,200 of my hard earned money
[01:31:22.420 --> 01:31:24.740]   to upgrade to this thing if you don't care?
[01:31:24.740 --> 01:31:26.180]   - How much was it to upgrade?
[01:31:26.180 --> 01:31:28.580]   - I think it was like 1200 bucks for this new phone.
[01:31:28.580 --> 01:31:32.660]   The other thing is that the actual upgrade itself,
[01:31:32.660 --> 01:31:33.940]   and I'm not exactly sure why,
[01:31:33.940 --> 01:31:35.700]   'cause I didn't take the time to unpack it.
[01:31:35.700 --> 01:31:36.740]   It took four hours.
[01:31:36.740 --> 01:31:40.580]   The actual migration of like from an old phone
[01:31:40.580 --> 01:31:43.380]   to a new phone and I thought, my gosh,
[01:31:43.380 --> 01:31:46.420]   this is such monopolistic behavior, right?
[01:31:46.420 --> 01:31:48.260]   So if it takes you an entire day
[01:31:50.020 --> 01:31:52.180]   to basically upgrade your phone,
[01:31:52.180 --> 01:31:53.620]   at some point, you're just gonna stay
[01:31:53.620 --> 01:31:56.420]   with the platform you're on and never upgrade,
[01:31:56.420 --> 01:31:59.220]   or you're just gonna stay on the exact same device
[01:31:59.220 --> 01:32:01.220]   because it's just too complicated.
[01:32:01.220 --> 01:32:03.220]   Imagine going from an Apple to an Android.
[01:32:03.220 --> 01:32:06.340]   - In some ways, both of these businesses
[01:32:06.340 --> 01:32:07.940]   are victims of their own success.
[01:32:07.940 --> 01:32:10.420]   They reach like market saturation.
[01:32:10.420 --> 01:32:12.420]   They reach their natural audience and then some,
[01:32:12.420 --> 01:32:14.340]   and they've just got to figure out what to do next.
[01:32:14.340 --> 01:32:16.020]   And the adjacencies are hard to find.
[01:32:16.020 --> 01:32:19.460]   - Also, also, also photos.
[01:32:19.460 --> 01:32:22.100]   - Oh, they destroyed the app. - It's terrible, it's terrible.
[01:32:22.100 --> 01:32:23.860]   - Stop changing the interface, Apple.
[01:32:23.860 --> 01:32:27.540]   - This is basically a camera and you made it terrible.
[01:32:27.540 --> 01:32:28.740]   It was good.
[01:32:28.740 --> 01:32:29.620]   Why did you do that?
[01:32:29.620 --> 01:32:32.900]   - I think they're trying to change things for change sake.
[01:32:32.900 --> 01:32:34.980]   One of the things Amazon's gotten correct
[01:32:34.980 --> 01:32:37.540]   and other services like eBay and Craigslist
[01:32:37.540 --> 01:32:39.300]   is when you have an interface that works
[01:32:39.300 --> 01:32:42.900]   and billions of people rely on it,
[01:32:42.900 --> 01:32:46.580]   you have to be very, very subtle in making changes to it.
[01:32:46.580 --> 01:32:48.820]   And they made a wholesale change to the photos app
[01:32:48.820 --> 01:32:50.100]   and it did not work.
[01:32:50.100 --> 01:32:51.140]   - It did not work. - It is garbage.
[01:32:51.140 --> 01:32:54.740]   - How do I get rid of the second silent thing on my thing?
[01:32:54.740 --> 01:32:57.380]   How can I just go back to the old thing?
[01:32:57.380 --> 01:32:58.340]   - Yeah. - Totally.
[01:32:58.340 --> 01:33:02.020]   - That's when you know you failed as a product manager
[01:33:02.020 --> 01:33:03.300]   when people want the old thing.
[01:33:03.300 --> 01:33:05.300]   - But isn't this just so lazy?
[01:33:05.300 --> 01:33:07.940]   - Something's not right, yeah.
[01:33:07.940 --> 01:33:10.580]   - I know there's a lot of Apple people, this is,
[01:33:10.580 --> 01:33:11.540]   come on guys, can you just take this?
[01:33:11.540 --> 01:33:13.140]   - The control center is what he's showing
[01:33:13.140 --> 01:33:15.460]   and the control center is massively confusing.
[01:33:16.340 --> 01:33:18.820]   It's like changing where the lights are in your bedroom
[01:33:18.820 --> 01:33:21.220]   and like, yeah. - Okay, all right.
[01:33:21.220 --> 01:33:24.580]   Troubleshooting part of the All In podcast is over.
[01:33:24.580 --> 01:33:27.060]   I really wanna say thanks to Saks
[01:33:27.060 --> 01:33:29.700]   for participating headily in our Starbucks discussion.
[01:33:29.700 --> 01:33:32.420]   Saks, anything you wanna say on the maturity of Starbucks
[01:33:32.420 --> 01:33:34.180]   or other mature tech businesses
[01:33:34.180 --> 01:33:36.820]   or value luxury businesses as they get big?
[01:33:36.820 --> 01:33:39.620]   Too big to keep growing, anything else?
[01:33:39.620 --> 01:33:43.700]   - I mean, yeah, I'm just not an expert on Starbucks.
[01:33:43.700 --> 01:33:45.140]   I mean, I do like their product, but--
[01:33:45.140 --> 01:33:47.220]   - What do you get, what's your order?
[01:33:47.220 --> 01:33:48.660]   Tell us your order. - Yeah, what's your order?
[01:33:48.660 --> 01:33:51.300]   - I just get an Americano with a splash of oat milk.
[01:33:51.300 --> 01:33:53.780]   - Oh, it's like my order, Saks.
[01:33:53.780 --> 01:33:55.460]   - Oat milk! - That's a great order.
[01:33:55.460 --> 01:33:57.220]   - What happened to you? - I'm with you.
[01:33:57.220 --> 01:33:59.220]   Yeah, that's great, good for you.
[01:33:59.220 --> 01:34:01.460]   - How about I just send you some specialty chemicals
[01:34:01.460 --> 01:34:02.820]   that you can just pour down your throat?
[01:34:02.820 --> 01:34:04.740]   Some xanthan gum. - Colberg is oat milk bad?
[01:34:04.740 --> 01:34:07.220]   - Some cargegan. - Do it again
[01:34:07.220 --> 01:34:08.660]   and say you put in heavy cream,
[01:34:08.660 --> 01:34:10.020]   you're gonna get kicked out of MAGA.
[01:34:10.020 --> 01:34:11.700]   - This is horrible, Saks. - You cannot be ordering
[01:34:11.700 --> 01:34:12.900]   oat milk and be MAGA.
[01:34:13.540 --> 01:34:15.940]   They don't have nut milks at Mar-a-Lago.
[01:34:15.940 --> 01:34:17.300]   - I'm gonna find out in a couple of weeks,
[01:34:17.300 --> 01:34:18.900]   I'll let you know. - Don't put that stuff
[01:34:18.900 --> 01:34:20.260]   in your body, dude. - I bet they do.
[01:34:20.260 --> 01:34:22.980]   - You should take that sweater that you just took from Chamath
[01:34:22.980 --> 01:34:24.420]   and wear that to Mar-a-Lago when you go.
[01:34:24.420 --> 01:34:26.660]   It's like a perfect sweater for your Mar-a-Lago visit.
[01:34:26.660 --> 01:34:28.580]   - Oh, yeah. - Oh, my God, don't touch it.
[01:34:28.580 --> 01:34:30.580]   - The pink one, the pink one. - I'm still mad at Nat.
[01:34:30.580 --> 01:34:31.940]   I'm gonna talk to her about this.
[01:34:31.940 --> 01:34:33.300]   Don't touch it. - I'll talk to her at lunch.
[01:34:33.300 --> 01:34:34.100]   I'll talk to her at lunch.
[01:34:34.100 --> 01:34:35.060]   She's putting a sundress on.
[01:34:35.060 --> 01:34:37.060]   - I'm not having lunch with her. - Before you came on Zoom, Chamath,
[01:34:37.060 --> 01:34:38.580]   - Hey, sweetie. - she was actually,
[01:34:38.580 --> 01:34:40.500]   she was just sitting on his lap and they were just chatting.
[01:34:40.500 --> 01:34:41.860]   And I'm like, what is going on here?
[01:34:41.860 --> 01:34:44.180]   - How outrageous, how outrageous. - I'm all day.
[01:34:44.180 --> 01:34:45.300]   What do you want for lunch?
[01:34:45.300 --> 01:34:46.580]   I said, what do I want for lunch?
[01:34:46.580 --> 01:34:48.180]   Your company, that's what I told her.
[01:34:48.180 --> 01:34:50.900]   - Oh, sweetheart. - That's what I said.
[01:34:50.900 --> 01:34:53.460]   She said, oh, you're born English.
[01:34:53.460 --> 01:34:56.580]   - She's like, you speak to me so much more kindly than Chamath does.
[01:34:56.580 --> 01:34:57.940]   - Oh, my God. - Amazing.
[01:34:57.940 --> 01:34:59.220]   - Oh, my God. - All right.
[01:34:59.220 --> 01:35:01.940]   This has been another amazing episode of "The All-In Pod."
[01:35:01.940 --> 01:35:04.660]   As a team player, I have been here to pinch hit for J-Cal.
[01:35:04.660 --> 01:35:06.020]   He did not want to moderate this week,
[01:35:06.020 --> 01:35:09.140]   so I stepped in to fill the shoes. - I'll come back next week.
[01:35:09.140 --> 01:35:09.860]   - You did a good job. - One of the world's,
[01:35:09.860 --> 01:35:13.060]   - Solid job, solid job. - one of this show's greatest moderators.
[01:35:13.060 --> 01:35:19.540]   For your sultan of science, for the rain man,
[01:35:19.540 --> 01:35:24.580]   for the chairman dictator, and for the world's most absentee moderator,
[01:35:24.580 --> 01:35:28.900]   I want to thank you all. - I'm living a great life
[01:35:28.900 --> 01:35:30.260]   - and we will see you all next time. - right now in two months.
[01:35:30.260 --> 01:35:32.900]   He's stealing anything that's not nailed down.
[01:35:32.900 --> 01:35:35.380]   I'm the world's greatest house guest.
[01:35:35.380 --> 01:35:36.820]   He's putting together his own gift bag.
[01:35:36.820 --> 01:35:38.420]   - Love you, besties. - Love you, boys.
[01:35:38.420 --> 01:35:40.020]   - Bye-bye. - Bye-bye.
[01:35:40.020 --> 01:35:41.860]   I'll be there in a couple of hours, Sax.
[01:35:41.860 --> 01:35:45.620]   - I'm going all in. - We'll let your winners ride.
[01:35:45.620 --> 01:35:51.540]   - Rain man David Saxon. - I'm going all in.
[01:35:51.540 --> 01:35:53.860]   And instead, we open-sourced it to the fans,
[01:35:53.860 --> 01:35:55.620]   and they've just gone crazy with it.
[01:35:55.620 --> 01:35:57.620]   - Love you, Wesley. - I'm the queen of quinoa.
[01:35:57.620 --> 01:35:59.940]   - I'm going all in. - Let your winners ride.
[01:35:59.940 --> 01:36:04.500]   - Let your winners ride. - I'm going all in.
[01:36:04.500 --> 01:36:08.660]   - Besties are back. - This is my dog taking a notice
[01:36:08.660 --> 01:36:10.340]   - in your driveway, Sax. - Wait a minute.
[01:36:10.340 --> 01:36:14.900]   - Oh, man. - My avatar will meet me at once.
[01:36:14.900 --> 01:36:17.620]   We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy
[01:36:17.620 --> 01:36:18.820]   because they're all just useless.
[01:36:18.820 --> 01:36:20.260]   It's like this, like, sexual tension
[01:36:20.260 --> 01:36:21.700]   that they just need to release somehow.
[01:36:21.700 --> 01:36:24.740]   - What the beep? - What the beep?
[01:36:24.740 --> 01:36:27.220]   - What the beep? - What the beep?
[01:36:27.220 --> 01:36:29.220]   - What the beep? - We need to get merch.
[01:36:29.220 --> 01:36:31.140]   - Besties are back. - I'm going all in.
[01:36:31.140 --> 01:36:40.980]   I'm going all in.
