[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:13.440]   - Welcome back to Ask the Compound.
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.660]   Remember our email here is askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.540]   It's a new year, same old questions.
[00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.660]   We even got a bunch of questions over the holidays.
[00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.460]   People still care about their finances over the holidays.
[00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.380]   Maybe there was some deep introspection.
[00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.720]   Duncan is calling in today from Disney.
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.960]   World, land, I always get 'em confused.
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.120]   What's one in Florida, World?
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.160]   - Disney World.
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.000]   - Okay.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.440]   - Yeah, I ran a 5K at 5 a.m. this morning.
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.760]   - Why so early?
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.900]   Was it like through Disney?
[00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.080]   - Because they want everyone done before the parks open.
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.440]   - Okay, let's get into Disney in a minute.
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.680]   First, today's show is sponsored by Rocket Money.
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.200]   Rocket Money is a personal finance app
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.000]   that fines and cancels your unwanted subscriptions,
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.560]   monitors your spending, helps lower your bills.
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.880]   I've used it already.
[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.240]   You know what the best part about Rocket Money is?
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.280]   Not only do they negotiate bills for you,
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.180]   they negotiate how much you pay them.
[00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:59.920]   They were charging me like $10 a month,
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:00.880]   but they said, "What do you wanna pay?"
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:01.720]   I said, "How about three?"
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.420]   They said three, 'cause that's how much I used it.
[00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.080]   Five million users that use the service.
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.920]   People save an average of $720 a year
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.960]   with over 500 million in canceled subscriptions in total.
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.800]   I'm gonna let them try to negotiate
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.400]   with AT&T this year for me.
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.960]   I've done it every year for eight or nine years
[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.540]   for my cable and my internet.
[00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.320]   I'm gonna let Rocket Money do it.
[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.840]   Stop wasting money on the things you don't use.
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.300]   Cancel unwanted subscriptions.
[00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.520]   Go into rocketmoney.com/atc.
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.960]   That's rocketmoney.com/atc.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:30.800]   I use this.
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.480]   I get emails a couple times a week.
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.760]   Here's your summary of all your bills.
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.440]   Here's this unwanted expense.
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.280]   It's really nice.
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.100]   They get your inbox.
[00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.520]   It's great.
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.240]   All right, Duncan, what's the heat check at Disney?
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.480]   - Well, yeah, I messaged you the other day.
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.940]   I was like, I gotta ask you some questions
[00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.120]   about Disney stock.
[00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.000]   I don't understand.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.160]   I'm a long-term shareholder, I think, like you are.
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.080]   I don't understand how so many people are here
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.800]   and spending so much money
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.300]   and the stock still looks the way it does.
[00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.000]   I guess it's streaming.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.520]   Is that maybe the answer?
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.480]   What's your explanation?
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.760]   - It would be interesting to see
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.080]   if we could do the counterfactual of Disney,
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.480]   if they never did Disney+.
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.080]   'Cause at the time, it seemed like a home run.
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.440]   They had so many people sign up
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.920]   and I think they just didn't realize
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.280]   how much they were really putting themselves
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.400]   on the hook for spending money.
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.020]   And it is all streaming.
[00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.400]   I think all the streamers
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.920]   and all the entertainment companies
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.000]   got whacked besides Netflix.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.720]   And I guess it doesn't matter how much people spend.
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.120]   The movies have also been underperforming as well.
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.000]   They haven't been doing as well.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.360]   We watched the new "Indiana Jones" with my son last week.
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.660]   I don't know.
[00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:41.860]   Did that need to be made?
[00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:42.700]   Probably not.
[00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:43.960]   I don't know, they spent a couple hundred million dollars
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:44.800]   on it, so.
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.620]   - I didn't even know it had come out.
[00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.100]   - Yeah, it's on Disney+ now.
[00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.660]   Unfortunately, yes, I bought Disney for my kids.
[00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.600]   So hey, let's buy some shares
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.080]   and teach you up the stock market.
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.020]   I taught them right.
[00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.880]   I think they're only down 40% or so.
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.960]   So yeah, people keep spending at the park.
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:02.800]   If it would have just been the park--
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.280]   - Should have called them a Target Dave Fund.
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.240]   - Yeah, and merchandise,
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.880]   maybe Disney would be doing better.
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.720]   But alas.
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:10.880]   - Hey, up first today we have,
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.680]   hey guys, I figured I'd present a scenario
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.240]   for normal folk like myself for the not-to-brags.
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.040]   I like the idea of a modified version
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.180]   of the fire movement-- - He's an anti-not-to-brag guy.
[00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.660]   - Known as Coast Fire,
[00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.360]   where you hit a principal savings goal
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.300]   and then never have to save a dollar again for retirement.
[00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.600]   For example, currently I have no debt
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.320]   and $50,000 earmarked for retirement.
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.440]   I'm 30 years old and it's highly unlikely
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.020]   that I would never contribute to this portfolio again.
[00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.920]   If I added $200 a month between my wife and I
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.320]   for the next 35 years, word willing,
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.800]   at a 7% return, I get a balance of $935,000.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.300]   Why is it that so many people think
[00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.000]   you need one to $3 million in retirement?
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.240]   When to me, assuming a 7% return
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.920]   is already more on the conservative side
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.720]   and obviously Social Security will most likely be around.
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:57.920]   What am I missing?
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.840]   - One of the few young people
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.400]   who actually think Social Security is gonna be there.
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.400]   I tend to agree with Andrew here.
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.600]   This Coast Fire strategy makes sense in theory,
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.900]   in the fact that if you front load
[00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.140]   your retirement contributions,
[00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.480]   then compound interest will do the heavy lifting
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.040]   for you on the back end, right?
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.880]   That would mean less money you have to put in
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.480]   to save for the future.
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.000]   I do like some of the ideas behind the fire movement.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.280]   It's financially independent, retire early,
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.800]   it's a high savings rate.
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.600]   People are very good at long-term planning for this.
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.940]   There's discipline involved.
[00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.640]   Other parts I don't care for,
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.100]   delayed gratification is fine,
[00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.420]   but I'd rather have you enjoy some of this stuff now.
[00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.680]   I think that's what this Coast strategy is.
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.040]   It's listen, I'm gonna front load everything
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.060]   and then if I don't have to save it as much,
[00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.760]   I can spend some now and then in retirement,
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:44.960]   I'll have this nest egg.
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:45.800]   To each their own.
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.680]   There are no perfect retirement strategies, obviously.
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.240]   So Andrew's in pretty good shape.
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.300]   $50,000 saved, no debt, 30 years old.
[00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.240]   It's possible this strategy will work out,
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.560]   but I think there's some questions
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.640]   you should ask yourself before totally banking
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:59.480]   on something like this.
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.240]   What if returns are lower?
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.220]   So sure, if you grow that $50,000 at 7%,
[00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.840]   by my calculations after 35 years, we're talking 530K,
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.200]   add in the $200 a month and yeah,
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.720]   you're already close to 900 or something I got.
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:14.920]   If returns are actually 8%,
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.800]   that 50K would turn into 740,000 over 35 years.
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.680]   That's pretty good, right?
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.800]   Now add the $200 a month in at 8%,
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.120]   we're talking, you know, 900K to a 1.1 million.
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.040]   It's actually not bad.
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.960]   But what if returns are 6%?
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.920]   John will do a chart on here of this growth of 50K
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:30.760]   over 35 years.
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.720]   I looked at 6%, 5%, 7% and 8%
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:38.720]   and that 5% returns grows $50,000 to 275,000.
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.520]   At 6%, we're talking 384,000.
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.520]   So now that's much lower.
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.480]   That totally changes the idea here,
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.540]   if you were really banking on that money being there.
[00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:52.720]   Maybe social security can fill the gaps
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:53.540]   and that's enough for you,
[00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.480]   but lower returns could severely crimp that lifestyle.
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.500]   So I think you also have to think about
[00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.440]   what if your lifestyle changes?
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.200]   So there's a road that runs by my office
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:06.760]   and it was really bad and it goes to a bunch of businesses,
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.640]   but it was two lanes going each way
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.320]   and then a median where you could do turns, right?
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.200]   And for years, there was huge potholes
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.040]   and they needed to fix it.
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.920]   And then one summer, they ripped it all up and redid it.
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:19.280]   They put in those, you know, those turnaround things,
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.420]   that's a circle, what do they call them?
[00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:24.080]   Where everyone has a yield and no one knows what to do.
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:24.920]   - A roundabout?
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.280]   - Yeah, people just blow through the yields.
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.280]   And so they put some of those in so it looks nicer.
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:31.200]   And then instead of having the turn lane in the middle,
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.800]   what they did is they put a median in.
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.280]   So they added a curb and then they put some grass
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.120]   and some trees in there.
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.020]   And then instead of having it be a turn lane,
[00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:39.560]   they added these small turn lanes
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:40.640]   so you could turn in the middle, right?
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.720]   There'd be one, there'd be holes in the median
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.400]   where you could turn in.
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.880]   But they made the roads very narrow
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.080]   and they didn't think through the design
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.880]   of all the businesses.
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.680]   So there's like a Best Buy and a Nordstrom Rack
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.140]   and all these businesses in a sports store, right?
[00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:56.900]   All these trucks that have to deliver inventory
[00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.640]   to these buildings and these businesses,
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.560]   they didn't have enough room to turn.
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.920]   So within the first week of this new design being done,
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:07.420]   it looks great, all the trucks are driving on the lawn
[00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:09.320]   and they totally ripped all the medians up
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:11.020]   because the trucks couldn't fit.
[00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:13.680]   So the designers didn't leave a big enough margin
[00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.020]   for safety.
[00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:15.860]   And the funny thing is,
[00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:16.880]   is that there's actually a story about it.
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.480]   They had to come back months later
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.800]   and tear up part of the median to make the turns wider,
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.600]   make the entrances wider.
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:23.780]   And they still didn't do it perfectly
[00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:25.900]   because there's still trucks that drive on the lawn.
[00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:27.400]   And they interviewed the designers and said,
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.240]   "What happened here?"
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.780]   And they're like, "Oh, it's a good design.
[00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:31.200]   "We just had to make some tweaks."
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.160]   But they didn't leave themselves a margin of safety.
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.000]   And that's the problem here with this idea, I think,
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.760]   is that you can create a retirement plan
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:40.080]   that looks really good in a spreadsheet,
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.120]   but I think you have to give yourself some wiggle room
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:43.840]   in case things change.
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:45.600]   Life in your 30s is gonna look way different
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:48.560]   than life in your 40s and 50s and 60s.
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.560]   You might take on some debt, you might have some kids,
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:51.900]   you might go back to school,
[00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:53.720]   you might decide the fire movement isn't for you.
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:55.760]   Like, plans could change.
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:58.640]   So I think that you add in a margin of safety
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:07:59.620]   to account for that.
[00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:02.620]   So I think that you just have to give yourself
[00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:04.160]   some breathing room if your preferences change,
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.000]   'cause they probably will.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.680]   The other thing is, what about inflation?
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:10.040]   Sure, one to $3 million seems too much, and I can--
[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:10.880]   - Yeah, I was gonna say,
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.200]   what about impending hyperinflation?
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.320]   - Well, it doesn't have to be hyperinflation.
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:17.880]   The inflation rate in the US over the past 100 years or so
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:19.360]   is roughly 3%, it's a little more than that,
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:20.800]   but let's call it 3%.
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:25.800]   Over 35 years, 3% inflation turns $1 into 37 cents, right?
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:30.400]   2% inflation cuts your money in half over 35 years.
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:34.160]   Bump it up to 4%, and $1 becomes 26 cents.
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:37.200]   If it's shadow stats inflation, we're talking 15%,
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.560]   I think you have negative money after 35 years.
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:42.080]   You owe someone else money.
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.840]   So I think the numbers your Coast Fire Plan spits out
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:46.980]   may seem completely doable
[00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:48.640]   based on today's current level of spending
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.320]   and the big pot of money you see,
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:53.620]   but what if that money doesn't take you as far
[00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:54.460]   in the future?
[00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:56.960]   Obviously, there's no guarantees in any of this stuff,
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:00.160]   but I think you can give yourself a margin of safety,
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.200]   and here's what I would do.
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:04.080]   So they're looking at the $200 of savings.
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.860]   I would move from a dollar amount
[00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:07.400]   to a percentage of your income.
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:09.760]   So let's say this couple, this guy and his wife,
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:11.200]   make 60K a year.
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.920]   If they're saving $200 a month, that's $2,400 a year.
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.200]   We're talking like a 4% savings rate.
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.480]   It's pretty low as far as I'm concerned,
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:19.520]   but hey, they already front-loaded it a little bit.
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:22.320]   I think you make it a percentage,
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:25.800]   and then you bump it up a little bit each year.
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.960]   And so let's say they start with that 4%,
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.280]   and they bump it up 3% a year,
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.720]   and I'm not talking going from 4% to 7%.
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:36.200]   I'm talking 3% in total going like 4% to 4.1%, then 4.2.
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:38.680]   If you just did that a little bit,
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:41.240]   so after 35 years of saving $2,400 a year,
[00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.320]   you're saving 84 grand in total.
[00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:44.660]   If you did my thing where you just bump it up
[00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:45.500]   a little bit each year,
[00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:46.480]   and you save a percentage of your income,
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:48.640]   and that income grows by inflation every year,
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:50.840]   now we're saving almost $300,000.
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:54.360]   So I would like if you made more of a percentage of income
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.800]   to give yourself that margin of safety.
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:56.720]   So as your income grows,
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:59.280]   so does your savings and your spending.
[00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:00.780]   You can still allow that initial investment
[00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:02.320]   to coast for you into retirement,
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:05.320]   but I think making some minor tweaks like this
[00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:07.120]   gives you a little bit of a bigger margin of safety.
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.520]   That's what I'm looking for for retirement savings.
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:11.840]   And then--
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:12.660]   - Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:13.500]   - And then don't go to Disney,
[00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:14.960]   otherwise you can't save anything.
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:20.060]   - Yeah, I mean, yeah, there's a lot of people here.
[00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:23.700]   Okay, so up next,
[00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:26.880]   we have our first audio question in a long time.
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:28.320]   - I've listened to you and Batnick
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.080]   talk about inflation all year,
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:31.860]   especially about whether prices
[00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:35.000]   should generally revert to normal,
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.240]   and whether this is more like post-World War II
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.720]   or the '70s.
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:39.640]   Here's the question.
[00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:42.720]   Is it helpful or even accurate to refer to
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:47.280]   temporary shifts in supply and demand as inflation?
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:49.760]   Econ 201 taught me inflation is due
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:53.040]   to supply and demand of the dollar itself.
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:55.520]   The Fed tinkers with rates and reserves,
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.680]   and the money supply changes.
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:00.240]   Congress spends some money, or doesn't,
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:02.200]   and aggregate demand changes.
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.000]   The economic cycle goes round,
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.960]   and true inflation waxes and wanes.
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:07.920]   On the other hand,
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:10.840]   sometimes prices change for their own reasons.
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:13.240]   Gas goes up because of geopolitics,
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:14.840]   and then things settle down.
[00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:18.240]   Shipping prices go up because of supply chain issues,
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.600]   and then it gets better.
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.880]   Milk and eggs go up for agricultural
[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:23.360]   and consumption reasons,
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:25.360]   and then they come back down.
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:28.440]   These are all round trip, transitory,
[00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:32.460]   end the roller coaster right where you started episodes.
[00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:35.920]   All these factors were strong in the last few years,
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:39.800]   but they are two different families of phenomena,
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.640]   yet the popular and economic press
[00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:43.420]   treats it all as inflation,
[00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:46.780]   because CPI scoops up everything.
[00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:49.600]   So, does distinguishing between
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:51.880]   the supply and demand of goods and services,
[00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:54.460]   which the Fed can't really touch,
[00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:56.960]   versus the supply and demand of money itself,
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:58.780]   does that help us understand
[00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:01.520]   which forces have been more dominant,
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:04.380]   and what might be likely to happen next?
[00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:07.360]   - Good radio. - Very eloquent question.
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:08.200]   Yes.
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:13.940]   My general baseline take here,
[00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:17.000]   and I wanna get into some of the technical aspects of this,
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.560]   is that there's just a lot of stuff
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:20.960]   that we don't know and understand about inflation.
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:24.940]   Even the Fed doesn't really have a good handle
[00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:27.040]   on what causes inflation.
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:27.880]   'Cause if you remember,
[00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:32.700]   they wanted things to run a little hot this period,
[00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:34.980]   and then they went really hot.
[00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:36.300]   And they wanted to cool things off,
[00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:37.140]   and they did cool off,
[00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:38.740]   but I'm not sure they did for the reasons
[00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:39.880]   that the Fed said they would.
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:43.620]   So, let's start with some charts.
[00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:44.460]   John, give me a chart on,
[00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:45.960]   this is the US Consumer Price Index
[00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:47.700]   going back to the early 1900s.
[00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:51.680]   You can see since the 1940s pretty much,
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:53.640]   this just goes up and up and up and up and up.
[00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:57.120]   The only time it really fell in the early 1920s,
[00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:59.240]   and then the late 1920s and early 1930s
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:01.000]   from the Great Depression,
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.640]   we don't really have much deflation anymore.
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:05.360]   So, to the point of this question,
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:07.840]   yes, some things wax and wane and come and go,
[00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:10.580]   but mostly the price goes up.
[00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:13.780]   And while inflation itself is not a good thing,
[00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:15.120]   it's the lesser of two evils,
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:16.720]   you wouldn't really want deflation
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:18.520]   because that means lower wages,
[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:19.580]   economic pain.
[00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:22.940]   I think you can, I guess, look at the money supply
[00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:23.900]   as a way to think about this.
[00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:25.260]   So, John, do the next chart.
[00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.420]   This is the M2 money supply,
[00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:30.180]   and I looked at it year over year.
[00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:34.020]   And this chart goes back to the 1950s,
[00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:36.300]   and the crazy thing is is that
[00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:40.140]   it's never gone below zero until now.
[00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:42.340]   So, I guess part of that is because
[00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:44.740]   it's also never gone as high as it did before too.
[00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:47.780]   M2 money supply went up almost 30%.
[00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:48.620]   Even in the '70s,
[00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:49.960]   when that was one of the reasons
[00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:51.320]   for the inflation back in the '70s,
[00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:52.280]   it certainly wasn't the only one,
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:53.760]   but they were pumping up money supply.
[00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:56.880]   It got to 12 or 15%,
[00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:59.600]   but it never got as high as we did during the pandemic.
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:00.480]   And obviously that's because
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:01.480]   we were spending so much money
[00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:03.160]   to keep the economy afloat.
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:04.000]   Now it's negative.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:04.840]   So, I guess you could say,
[00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:07.800]   well, if you saw the money supply spike so much,
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:09.120]   and people like Jeremy Siegel did say
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:10.480]   that's gonna cause inflation,
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:11.560]   and he was right,
[00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:12.400]   now that it's falling,
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:13.220]   you could say, okay,
[00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:15.440]   that must mean inflation is gonna fall as well.
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:17.920]   I think that would kind of make sense.
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:24.080]   I guess my way of thinking at this is,
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:25.920]   is yes, there's going to be certain things
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:26.800]   that come and go,
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:28.440]   especially for volatile things
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:31.440]   like the energy sector or food.
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:34.200]   TVs seem to get cheaper all the time.
[00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.000]   I still don't understand why TVs get cheaper
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.080]   every single year.
[00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:39.800]   I like it, but I don't understand why.
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:41.400]   I think it's interesting for people like me
[00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:42.340]   to dissect this stuff.
[00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:44.800]   I think every time we get about an inflation,
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.760]   there's going to be a different reason that comes along.
[00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:47.840]   So you could figure out,
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:49.840]   I know exactly why it happened in the '40s.
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:51.760]   I know exactly why it happened in the '70s.
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:53.320]   People still argue about those periods.
[00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:56.200]   And then I know exactly why it happened in the pandemic.
[00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:57.280]   Part of it was demand
[00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:58.840]   because the government spent so much money.
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:14:59.900]   Part of it was also supply
[00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:01.360]   because there was supply constraints
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.800]   because companies held back
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:04.640]   because they thought we were going
[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:06.560]   into this nasty recession.
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:08.560]   I think your personal rate of inflation
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:10.140]   matters way more than the government statistic.
[00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:11.880]   That's where I come in on things.
[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:16.000]   If you could say the housing market inflation was terrible
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:16.840]   because rents went up,
[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:18.800]   but if you locked in a 3% mortgage,
[00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:20.880]   you basically experienced deflation
[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:23.080]   over this period, right?
[00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:24.880]   I think it matters more how much your wages are growing
[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:25.800]   and how much lifestyle creep
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.080]   you're introducing your budget every year.
[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:28.640]   So all these things probably matter more than that.
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:31.520]   I don't think anyone has an economic model
[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:33.840]   that can tell you how inflation is going to work.
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:36.480]   So this, usually people say econ 101.
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:40.480]   Our question person here asks econ 201.
[00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:41.780]   So they skipped a level.
[00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:44.920]   I feel like everything that I read and learned about
[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:46.600]   in my econ books has been tossed out the window
[00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:48.140]   the past three years, especially.
[00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:50.560]   It started in the 2010s, right?
[00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:52.460]   The Fed lowered rates
[00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:53.960]   and the Fed printed a bunch of money
[00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:55.880]   and people thought we're going to get hyperinflation
[00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:57.920]   and it didn't happen except at Disney.
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:02.820]   And then, yes, the Fed lowered rates
[00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:04.600]   and printed some money or whatever you call it
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:05.440]   in the pandemic,
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:06.840]   but the government also spent a bunch of money on that.
[00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:09.520]   So I don't think there is a single model
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:11.680]   because every time this happens,
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:14.320]   there's a curve ball and something out of left field
[00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:17.200]   people couldn't possibly predict.
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.640]   So no, I don't think there's a model
[00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:19.560]   that can help us explain it.
[00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:21.440]   You could look at the money supply.
[00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:23.600]   But I don't know, if you go back to my money supply chart,
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:27.000]   money supply was rising in the early 2010s as well.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.320]   People thought we were going to have big time inflation then
[00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:30.240]   and we never had it.
[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.840]   Inflation was relatively calm for the entire decade.
[00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:35.000]   So no, I don't think anyone has this figured out.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.080]   And I don't think they ever really will either
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:40.360]   because there's so many outside factors at play.
[00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:43.680]   - Up next, we have your recent article on NASDAQ returns
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:47.320]   basically describes the NASDAQ as having amplified reward
[00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:49.320]   and of course, risk as well.
[00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:50.680]   I've wondered this lately,
[00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:53.120]   but should very wealthy investors be allocating
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.840]   some of their assets towards investments,
[00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:58.200]   which are even riskier than total stock market indices?
[00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:00.880]   Is there even such a thing that gives
[00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:05.160]   semi-reliably better returns over the longterm?
[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:08.320]   And is such a thing even available to retail investors?
[00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:10.680]   Margin can obviously amplify risk and reward
[00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:13.120]   and it's probably a terrible idea for most,
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:16.520]   but maybe it produces an expected gain over the longterm
[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:18.760]   for those who can handle the risk.
[00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:21.120]   - Something people were not asking us in 2022.
[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:23.920]   How do I take more risk?
[00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:25.360]   John, throw up a chart here.
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:28.000]   I wrote a post on this, the NASDAQ 100 versus the S&P.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.240]   The NASDAQ 100 goes back to 1986.
[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:32.520]   You can just eyeball this thing.
[00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:34.660]   I could give you all the volatility statistics or whatever,
[00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:37.000]   but you eyeball this and you see the highs are higher
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   and the lows are lower.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.360]   The gains are bigger, the losses are bigger.
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:42.760]   Since 1986, the NASDAQ 100 has outperformed.
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:45.960]   It's up 14% per year versus an 11% per year gain
[00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:47.020]   for the S&P.
[00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:49.060]   Now that sounds great, right?
[00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:49.900]   Oh, it's easy.
[00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:51.600]   But that includes an 80% plus drawdown
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:53.160]   after the dot-com bubble bursted.
[00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:55.880]   And I think you were underwater for almost a decade and a half
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:58.840]   it was like 13 years if we include dividends.
[00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:01.920]   And so, it's great you outperformed,
[00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:03.660]   but you would have had to hold on
[00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:08.660]   through just an unbelievably painful lost decade.
[00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:11.140]   Now, the way I like to look at it
[00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:14.100]   is risk and return are attached at the hip,
[00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:17.140]   but taking higher risk in the form of higher volatility
[00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:18.540]   does not guarantee you higher returns.
[00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:20.260]   Emerging market stocks have been far more volatile
[00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:22.500]   than the S&P over the past decade and a half or so.
[00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:24.380]   Returns have lagged meaningfully.
[00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:27.500]   So is there a way to reliably outperform the U.S. stock market?
[00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:30.540]   I mean, some people would say there's a small cap premium
[00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:34.460]   or there's a value premium or quality stocks or momentum.
[00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:36.620]   And you could look at different strategies
[00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:38.180]   and different periods and find
[00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:40.540]   when all of those strategies have outperformed.
[00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:43.540]   There's a lot of factors to choose from the strategies.
[00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:44.620]   And this whole thing like,
[00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:46.900]   is something available to retail investors?
[00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:48.700]   There's no secrets that are available
[00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:50.520]   just to rich and wealthy people
[00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:52.060]   that are institutional investors that aren't retail.
[00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:54.460]   Like everything is available to everyone these days.
[00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:56.620]   And most of the stuff the institutional investors invest in
[00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:59.260]   isn't worth the time as a retail investor anyway.
[00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:01.100]   But there's nothing reliable
[00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:02.520]   when it comes to financial markets.
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:04.500]   The S&P 500 and NASDAQ 100 right now
[00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:05.340]   feel like sure things.
[00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:08.580]   I can promise you these indexes, Duncan, you say indices.
[00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:11.340]   I think only British people can say that.
[00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:13.340]   - I'm pretty sure on Bloomberg they say indices.
[00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:14.940]   That's where I've heard that.
[00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:17.460]   - Yeah, but I feel like you have to be British.
[00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:19.540]   We add extra use into your words.
[00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:20.940]   I say indexes.
[00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:22.620]   These indexes will underperform
[00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:23.900]   for an extended period of time at some point.
[00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:25.500]   I don't know when, I don't know why,
[00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:27.380]   I don't know the magnitude, but it's going to happen.
[00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:28.880]   This is just how markets work.
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:30.220]   So I think the best strategy,
[00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:31.860]   if you're going to invest in a more volatile asset,
[00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:34.540]   whether it's small caps or the NASDAQ 100
[00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:37.900]   or leveraged funds or whatever it is,
[00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:39.460]   whatever you choose,
[00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:42.940]   I think the best way is just to rebalance regularly.
[00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:46.100]   So you lean into the pain when there's the downside
[00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:47.340]   'cause the downside is going to be worse
[00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:48.660]   in a more volatile asset.
[00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:49.520]   And then you take some gains
[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:50.580]   when it's volatile to the upside.
[00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:52.420]   And counterintuitively,
[00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:54.140]   a more volatile asset class or strategy
[00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:56.660]   can actually reduce overall volatility
[00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:59.100]   if you utilize it in this counter-cyclical way.
[00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:01.400]   So I think that's the way you have to think about it
[00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:03.460]   is I'm going to have a 10% position
[00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:04.940]   in this highly volatile asset class
[00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:06.640]   or 15 or whatever it is,
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:09.080]   but I'm going to regularly rebalance it
[00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:12.100]   every time it shoots way up or it falls down.
[00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:13.400]   So I think that's the way to lean into the pain.
[00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:15.600]   That's how you use volatility to your advantage
[00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:17.340]   is you rebalance and you don't,
[00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:20.320]   that way you're not going all in when it's up a lot
[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:22.420]   and then getting out when it's down a lot.
[00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:24.960]   - That makes sense.
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:26.940]   All right, so up next we have,
[00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:28.740]   that question was from Patrick, by the way.
[00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:31.960]   So up next we have a question from Mark.
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:34.100]   Mark writes, "I'm 35 years old
[00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:35.960]   "and work in the hospitality industry.
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:37.340]   "I've just started with a new company

[00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:58.040]   "in the account I'm pausing investing in?"
[00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:00.440]   - Sounds like Mark gave himself a margin of safety here.
[00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:01.940]   Not to brag, Mark.
[00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:03.320]   I would be curious in how he's determining
[00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:05.600]   he's saving too much, but let's,
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.680]   this is definitely a financial planning question
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:08.920]   versus an investment question,
[00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:10.960]   so let's bring in a financial planning expert,
[00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:14.680]   Mr. Nick Sapienza, coming to us straight from Louisiana.
[00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:17.380]   Nick, how do you think about the hierarchy here?
[00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:20.360]   So we've got a 401k plan, we've got a Roth IRA,
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:22.280]   we've got a brokerage account.
[00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:25.240]   How do you rank these?
[00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:27.420]   I mean, for me, this is like trying to figure out
[00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:29.380]   who my favorite child is.
[00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:30.220]   - Yeah.
[00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:31.220]   - It's really hard.
[00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:33.060]   - Yeah, I mean, in Mark's case,
[00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:35.100]   like he kind of left out some key details
[00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:36.340]   of what his goals are.
[00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:37.740]   So like the simple answer for me
[00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:39.660]   is if I'm looking at Mark and just saying,
[00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:42.740]   you know, he's 35, he potentially has maybe 30 years
[00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:44.260]   'til where he retires and maybe he lives
[00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:47.180]   for another 30 years, so he's got a 60-year runway,
[00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:50.580]   simply prioritizing tax deferral and tax diversification.
[00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:52.320]   So that's the 401k and the Roth,
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:55.920]   if he's trying to narrow it down to two, those are the two.
[00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:57.160]   But I wanted to take it a little bit further.
[00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:59.040]   - You always want to get the 401k match first.
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:21:59.880]   He's got to match.
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:02.400]   That's the easy decision.
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:03.780]   I agree the Roth is good.
[00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:07.120]   Bill Sweet would tell a special young person to do that.
[00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:08.560]   Nick Magiulli, on the other hand, would say,
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:10.400]   listen, a brokerage account is actually more flexible,
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:12.160]   especially if you're younger and want to spend some of it.
[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:15.100]   So that's your point about the goals is,
[00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:17.040]   it should maybe we keep all three of these
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:19.880]   and even if you have to decrease some of the contributions
[00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:21.200]   to one or the other, does it make sense
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:23.400]   to give yourself some more options
[00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:24.920]   by having all three accounts?
[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:26.640]   - The way I break it down is,
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:29.640]   and I don't know if his 401k has a Roth 401k feature,
[00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:30.920]   if it has an after-tax feature.
[00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:32.220]   I don't know how much money he makes,
[00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:33.440]   what his tax situation is like,
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:35.400]   but let's just say there are three different scenarios
[00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:36.920]   that we could target.
[00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:41.540]   The first is Mark retires at 65, a normal retirement maybe.
[00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:43.660]   The second is an early retirement at 55
[00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:47.080]   and the third is some sort of mixture of early retirement,
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.200]   fat fire, you know, coast fire, whatever,
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:51.560]   or like a sabbatical and a delayed retirement,
[00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:52.760]   something like that.
[00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:56.160]   Then that, they're almost all the same
[00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:58.080]   in terms of how I would prioritize them,
[00:22:58.080 --> 00:22:59.920]   except for the sabbatical, of course.
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:02.360]   For normal retirement, you know, you're really,
[00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:04.280]   you want to look at the 401k first,
[00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:06.480]   again, match other features
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:08.280]   and then move on to the Roth,
[00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:09.920]   maxing out that Roth option.
[00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:13.880]   The split as far as if it should be 50/50
[00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:15.240]   or some other combination, again,
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:18.880]   depends on his income, depends on his tax situation.
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:20.640]   So there's a, maybe, you know,
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:21.800]   a need for some tax planning there.
[00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:22.960]   - I like the idea of looking at this
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:24.720]   from retirement scenarios, 'cause you're right.
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:28.320]   The time horizon probably comes into play here,
[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:29.600]   depending on how much flexibility you need.
[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:31.320]   And obviously the Roth gives a little more flexibility too,
[00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:34.320]   'cause you can take those contributions out without penalty,
[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:35.600]   but I like the way of looking at it.
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:37.200]   - That's the key thing that I wanted to point out
[00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:39.640]   is you can take those contributions out at any time
[00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:41.760]   without penalty or without tax.
[00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:45.440]   So maybe that frees up an additional 6,500 bucks
[00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:49.360]   or whatever his basis is at that point.
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:51.600]   The second scenario is early retirement.
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:54.560]   So if he retires at 55, the rule of 55 applies.
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:55.880]   So the year in which he turns 55,
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:57.560]   he can start withdrawing from his 401k.
[00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:00.840]   Key thing here, Mark, is like, leave your 401k alone.
[00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:03.400]   Don't roll it over or roll it into a new 401k
[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:05.200]   if you choose to move.
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:07.720]   The prioritization, it kind of comes back
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:09.920]   to the financial planning thing of what we don't know
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:12.080]   is like how much money you're gonna need to spend
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:15.160]   between ages 55 until you start social security.
[00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:17.320]   Can you survive on the basis of that Roth
[00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:19.400]   or do you need to tap into that brokerage account?
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:22.160]   And also you can use that, he asked another question.
[00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:23.480]   What do I do with the brokerage account?
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:25.680]   In the meantime, obviously either leave it invested
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:28.320]   or you can use money from the brokerage account
[00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:30.480]   to fund your Roth IRA contributions.
[00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:32.640]   So you can sort of like siphon that money
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:34.520]   into the Roth from that point.
[00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:38.000]   I've already, this has been double-checked
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.120]   by Bill Arturonian, so it's not,
[00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:43.760]   you're not doing anything wrong from that standpoint.
[00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:47.280]   But you can also free up some cash flow
[00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:49.560]   and that creates maybe another scenario there.
[00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:51.040]   The last one is-- - And the other thing is,
[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:53.400]   sorry, the other thing is I'm a big proponent
[00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:55.840]   of young people enjoying their money and spending it.
[00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:58.720]   But to your point of if there is any inkling
[00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:00.840]   of I wanna retire early, maybe you don't decrease
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:03.920]   your savings at all and keep putting the money
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:04.760]   in your, putting into these.
[00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:06.840]   - Well, it goes back to the first or the second question
[00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:08.440]   that you answered, which was about the margin of safety.
[00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:11.520]   It's just creating that scenario for what if?
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:12.440]   What if things change?
[00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:13.800]   And yeah, I mean, some people just aren't
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:16.320]   into spending money like others are.
[00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:18.960]   They have a very low bar in terms
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:20.440]   of what they get enjoyment out of.
[00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:22.600]   So where else should that money go?
[00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:24.120]   And just save it into the brokerage account
[00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:25.320]   so that you do have more flexibility
[00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:27.280]   if that's the scenario that Mark's in.
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:29.560]   And then if you're in a sabbatical situation
[00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:32.160]   where you wanna take a break, have your Walter Mitty moment,
[00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:35.440]   then I'm still looking at 401(k) up to the match.
[00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:38.440]   And then from there, I'm looking at brokerage or Roth,
[00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:40.880]   depending on how much I'll need to spend
[00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:42.080]   during that period that I'm--
[00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:43.880]   - Walter Mitty, not a bad movie.
[00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:44.720]   - Yeah.
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:45.680]   - That was underrated.
[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:48.280]   - Yeah, like that one a lot. - Never saw it.
[00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:49.400]   - Every time I hear the name Mark though,
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:51.880]   I think about that pregame speech with the basketball team.
[00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:52.920]   He's like, "We're rocking with Mark
[00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:53.880]   'cause Mark's rocking with us."
[00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:54.720]   Have you seen that?
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:55.560]   (laughing)
[00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:57.000]   - No. - It's hilarious.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.120]   - All right, one more question, Duncan.
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:02.880]   - All right, last but not least,
[00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:04.920]   we have a question from Rob.
[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:07.120]   I have two stocks I've held since the late '90s,
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:08.800]   Cisco and Intel.
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:10.280]   They were originally bought by my father
[00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:11.520]   as part of my college savings,
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:13.080]   and I'm assuming he never sold them
[00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:15.440]   since I was in college during a dot-com crash.
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:17.720]   They make up 23% and 16%
[00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:20.040]   of my investing account, respectively.
[00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:21.880]   This account is separate from my wife's
[00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:24.640]   and my retirement accounts, which we max out.
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:27.400]   The remainder of the account is in a range of ETFs.
[00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:29.720]   Cisco and Intel have not performed great,
[00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:32.160]   and I'm concerned about not being diversified.
[00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:34.760]   Is it better to dollar-cost average
[00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:36.800]   out of these two stocks or sell all at once
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:38.520]   so I can diversify immediately?
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:40.440]   Love the show and your movie recommendations
[00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:42.920]   heavily influence our nightly movie selection.
[00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:44.120]   - There we go.
[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:46.800]   I just gave Rob Walter Mitty, underrated movie.
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:49.840]   - Those are two rough stocks to have held for that long.
[00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:50.680]   - I'm surprised.
[00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:51.520]   So yeah, John, if you throw up the chart--
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:54.640]   - Props to Rob Sr., or whatever Rob's dad's name is,
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:58.040]   Diamond Hands, Rob Sr., for holding on for that long.
[00:26:58.040 --> 00:26:59.000]   That's impressive.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.440]   - It really depends when they bought them.
[00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:01.880]   So John, if you throw up the chart here,
[00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:04.960]   on a price basis alone, Cisco and Intel are still,
[00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:06.200]   they're both at the same place.
[00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:10.840]   They're roughly 37, 38% below the highs from 1999.
[00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:13.320]   Now, it really depends if Rob's dad bought them
[00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:16.280]   in '97, '98, or '99, how they're doing,
[00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:18.400]   'cause you probably did pretty good if you set the run-up.
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:20.680]   But these stocks have underperformed massively
[00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:24.400]   on the next chart, John, the S&P 500 since 1999.
[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:27.880]   The S&P's up 400%, Intel's up 100,
[00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:29.160]   and this is with dividends.
[00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:31.040]   Cisco's up 37%.
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:34.720]   Now, these stocks have done a little bit better lately,
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:36.800]   but you went through a huge period,
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:39.480]   and I'm guessing Rob probably never even looked.
[00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:40.440]   That's right, that was such a big part
[00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:42.600]   of his brokerage account, got 'em handed down.
[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:44.360]   I wonder, Nick, before we get into
[00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:46.240]   the financial planning aspects of this,
[00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:48.580]   how much does psychology play a role
[00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:50.200]   between if you bought these stocks
[00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:51.160]   versus someone else bought 'em?
[00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:54.200]   Because I feel like if these coming from someone else,
[00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:55.560]   it's a lot easier to rip the band-aid off
[00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:57.360]   and just get these out of my face,
[00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:59.680]   I'm done with them, they're losers,
[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:01.840]   versus I bought them, I have to wait
[00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:02.680]   'til they come back for us.
[00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:04.080]   Is there a psychological element there?
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:07.840]   There is, and it's more of not selling than to sell,
[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:10.480]   because it was a gift, or also because,
[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:11.760]   I can't tell you how many conversations
[00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:13.440]   I've had with people around here
[00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:16.760]   who have inherited the stock of an oil company,
[00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:19.800]   and it's just, I mean, it's crushed 'em,
[00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:21.320]   or it's just held them back,
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:22.880]   and they can't get themselves to sell it.
[00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:25.940]   In some cases, I've heard, not personally, but anecdotally,
[00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:28.520]   I've heard of people saying that on their deathbed,
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:30.720]   they said, they were told, "Do not sell this stock."
[00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:32.320]   Like, "Don't sell any of my Exxon stock,
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:35.400]   "or my Nivera stock, seriously, yes."
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:36.240]   Wow.
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:37.520]   So it's the opposite.
[00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:39.480]   That's gonna be Duncan with Oatley on his deathbed.
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:41.720]   He's gonna say, "Babe, don't sell my Oatley stock."
[00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:42.560]   100%.
[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:45.160]   Just don't pass it on to any children, yeah.
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:47.280]   Don't do that to 'em.
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:49.600]   So that might be Rob's scenario.
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:50.680]   You can't say no to that.
[00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:52.400]   You have to be diamond hands at that point.
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:55.600]   If you're getting a death wish from someone--
[00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:57.200]   I think there's an element of guilt involved
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:58.640]   in selling a stock.
[00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:00.640]   You kinda get married to the stock in that way.
[00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:02.640]   - I'm sorry, but the finance brain in me would go,
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:05.680]   "Sorry, Mom and Dad, I'm selling this tomorrow."
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:07.440]   I'm not adhering to your wishes.
[00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:08.480]   - And I would be the opposite.
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:09.720]   I would say, "Oh, I feel bad."
[00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:13.720]   I would maybe sell a little bit of it at a time.
[00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:14.560]   But props to him.
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:17.400]   I mean, especially the point of diversification,
[00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:19.200]   which we kinda talked about earlier.
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:22.480]   It would be impossible for me.
[00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:24.160]   Like, I could look at a chart, and like you said,
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:25.440]   it depends on when you bought it, right?
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:28.160]   You could have crushed the S&P over time period,
[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:33.160]   but I could not stand for lagging everything else
[00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:36.040]   for an extended period of time.
[00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:39.800]   Like, several years in a row where my Cisco and my Intel
[00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:43.160]   are flat or negative, and the market's ripping.
[00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:44.000]   That would just--
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.840]   - So how do you balance the potential tax ramifications?
[00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:50.840]   I don't know if there's a stepped-up basis here,
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:52.160]   if you got 'em handed down.
[00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:54.960]   So maybe there aren't really losses that he's sitting on
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:56.360]   versus the psychology behind,
[00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:57.200]   "I just wanna get out of these."
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:58.600]   So how do you balance the taxes
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:01.240]   versus the behavioral side of things?
[00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:04.360]   - I mean, what I thought about for this situation
[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:08.000]   was that there's maybe some reluctance to sell
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:08.840]   or some regret.
[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:10.640]   I mean, clearly, this is a burden for him and he wants,
[00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:11.720]   or that's what I'm picking up.
[00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:13.320]   It's a burden for him, he wants out of it.
[00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:15.240]   The way I look at it is you're swapping one asset
[00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:18.320]   for another, maybe an index fund, let's say.
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:20.400]   So something more durable, more reliable.
[00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:21.640]   He's not going to cash.
[00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:23.440]   So that should lessen the regret.
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:26.160]   And if you think about Rob's future,
[00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:29.840]   the best portfolio is the one that has the fewest burdens.
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:31.600]   I would love to, in a perfect world,
[00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:33.400]   you could just sell it all at once and move on
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:34.600]   and put that behind you.
[00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:39.600]   But taxes may be, and guilt may be something
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:40.720]   that comes into the picture.
[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:43.360]   So I think that there's just,
[00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:44.960]   Rob has to do what's best for himself.
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:46.320]   It's his financial plan.
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:48.200]   He has to, if he's not gonna do it all at once,
[00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:50.320]   if there are tax implications,
[00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:52.520]   then he can do quarterly selling,
[00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:55.680]   which is probably the most common route.
[00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:57.560]   You have a quarterly cadence where you sell
[00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:00.120]   a portion of the stock, 20, 25%.
[00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:02.120]   There's some tax planning that's involved there.
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:03.360]   But the other questions are,
[00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:05.160]   do you have any tax-less carry-forwards?
[00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:06.480]   Could you tax-less harvest right now?
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:08.520]   Do you plan to make any meaningful,
[00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:10.840]   charitable contributions this year?
[00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:14.240]   If he can combine tax planning with investment planning
[00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:16.240]   and financial planning, that's a home run for him.
[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:19.040]   - Yeah, and I guess if you did that slower
[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:20.680]   over dollar cost average, that gives you time
[00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:22.200]   to think about these things as well.
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:23.520]   Obviously, not that you can't do it,
[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:25.440]   do all those things by selling at once,
[00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:27.040]   but I think you'd give yourself some more time
[00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:29.160]   to think through those different routes.
[00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:32.480]   - I'm not leaving you a single share of Oatly, Ben.
[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:33.440]   - Okay. - A single share.
[00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:34.600]   - No, I don't get it.
[00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:35.960]   (laughing)
[00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:37.520]   All right.
[00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:40.440]   Thanks, as always, to Nick for coming in to help,
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:42.960]   to Duncan for calling in from Disney.
[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:45.240]   We appreciate all of your questions.
[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:49.240]   As always, remember, askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:50.080]   It's gonna be a good year.
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:51.800]   We've got new guests lined up already.
[00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:52.640]   Can't wait.
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:54.040]   - Oh yeah, happy new year.
[00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:55.160]   - Happy new year.
[00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:57.600]   Yep, this is the last time I'll say it.
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:00.120]   And we will see you next time.
[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:01.720]   - See you, everyone.
[00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:04.300]   (upbeat music)
[00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:06.880]   (upbeat music)
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:11.880]   [Music]
