[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.040]   the money that's in your checking account and actually tell it where to go in a really
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:28.400]   convenient and remarkable fashion. Budgeting is so important if it's forward-looking. That's
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.800]   to the benefit of the old envelope system. But in today's world, when you spend on a
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.400]   checking account or on a credit card, how do you actually budget? The answer is YNAB. You should
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.280]   know that by now. Three 34-day trial. Try it out. See how it works. Make sure to take their training
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.480]   videos and learn how the program works. It's fantastic. I think if you aren't a budgeter,
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.120]   if you signed up YNAB, I can't prove this, but I bet you'll probably wind up with at least an
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.120]   extra thousand bucks at the end of the year, almost no matter who you are, if not more.

[00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.840]   job with tracking and with also tracking investments. The way that I do it is I use

[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.360]   the accounts that I'm going to spend money out of. Personal Capital is completely free.

[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.760]   (Music)
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.520]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.920]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while also
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.560]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less. My name is Joshua Sheets. I'm your host,
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.000]   and today I'm your answerer. Today is Friday. That means we do a Q&A call. I've got callers
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.720]   sitting here on the line live. It'll be, I guess, what, open mic Friday, something like that?
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:37.200]   For those of you who are new to the show, on Fridays, as much as I'm able to do it and around
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.440]   my travel schedule, basically every Friday we try to do, I have a live Q&A call. I pre-record
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.240]   these calls about a day or two early before Friday, but then they're released to you in the
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:52.160]   feed on Friday. On today's call, we're going to have a couple of callers calling in. I've got
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.320]   them waiting here on the line, and we're just going to go to the phones. It's basically my way
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:04.560]   to create similar to a live talk show, and I really enjoy this ability to speak to you and speak to
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.080]   you live. If you'd like to join on a Friday Q&A call, the best way to do it, or the only way to
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:15.600]   do that, is to become a patron of the show. The patron model is where you, if you find value for
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.520]   the content that I create and you'd like to support me and help me be able to continue to do it the
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:25.040]   way that I do it, if you find value in that, then go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron.
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:32.160]   Sign up as a patron of the show, and then I'll share with you the notifications and the call-in
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.600]   information so that you can join on one of these Friday Q&A calls. That's the basic concept of it.
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.040]   We'll go to the phones in just a second. If you'd also like access to me, so again,
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.200]   these patron calls are probably the most reliable way for you to do that at the moment. I have
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.080]   plenty of time to visit, but of course that does result in the public release of your question and
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.720]   of our conversation. So you might need to edit private details or something like that in order
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.600]   to make sure that you aren't overly exposing yourself on a public podcast. If you'd like to
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.400]   speak with me privately, that option is also available to you. You can book a private paid
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:11.520]   consulting call with me. Go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/phonecall. Again, radicalpersonalfinance.com/phonecall.
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.280]   That will forward you through to a page where if you'd like to set up a time to speak to me
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.080]   privately, just you and me for consulting, then that's a great way for you to do it. So if you
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:26.640]   enjoy my answers or the way that I approach the questions and the problems here on the show,
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:31.360]   then this would be the way for you to go ahead and to join there, would be to schedule a call
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:37.360]   at radicalpersonalfinance.com/phonecall. Finally, I don't take emails anymore in terms of private
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.520]   emails. I do read them, but I'm not able to respond to them. But what I would encourage you to do is
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.160]   if you'd like to give me feedback on a show, go by the show page and comment on the show page
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.640]   at radicalpersonalfinance.com. And then from time to time on many Saturdays throughout this year,
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.960]   I'll sit down and I'll take those comments and I'll make clarifications or answer your questions
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:01.680]   as well. So I encourage you to do those things. Final quick announcement before we go right to
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.800]   our first caller, who's David from Canada, in just a moment here. If you have not yet taken
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.600]   my demographic survey, could you please do me a favor and just go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/survey
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:18.080]   and it'll take you just about, literally about 20 seconds. It's about a six question demographic
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:23.600]   survey. You put in your age. I can't even remember all the questions. It's six seconds,
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:29.040]   six questions, about 20 seconds worth. It's anonymous. There's an option on there to put
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.280]   your email address in there. You can put it in or not put it in. I don't care. But just put it,
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.600]   fill in the information there on that survey. That'd be super helpful. As I'm bringing new
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.080]   advertisers onto Radical Personal Finance, I need to have some sort of demographic data to be able
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:47.280]   to share with them who you are, who you, my listener is. And that'd be very helpful to me.
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.320]   You can do it right on your phone. There's a link in the show notes for today's show,
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.240]   which shows up on your podcatcher, whatever podcatcher you're using, whether that's
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:59.280]   the Apple Podcasts app or any of the rest of them. Just click on it, click on the description. You'll
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.960]   see a link that will forward you through or just type it in straight on your phone or on
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:08.800]   your computer at radicalpersonalfinance.com/survey. All right, announcements out of the way. First
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.680]   caller, let's go to David in Canada. Welcome to Radical Personal Finance. How can I serve you
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:21.040]   today, David? Well, thank you so much, Joshua. I am very excited to be on the call. Your podcast
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:26.320]   has shaped and directed a lot of my financial independence thinking over the last couple of
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.960]   years and definitely helped me in a number of areas and I really appreciate it. So I've only
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:36.160]   recently joined as a patron and will hopefully be there for many years because it's definitely
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:43.920]   worthwhile for me. Awesome. So here's my question. I've been following the Dave Ramsey plan and I'm
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:48.480]   through baby step three, which is build up your emergency fund. So I've paid off all my non-real
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:52.720]   estate debt and I've built up an emergency fund and now I'm trying to decide what to do next.
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:58.000]   According to his plan, it would be, you know, focus in and pay off my house essentially.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.960]   And I'm open to that idea. My wife is excited on that idea. Her security,
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:11.920]   she would feel much more secure if we do that. And I think it's a good idea, but I wanted,
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:15.920]   you've often had a different angle on a lot of things. And so I wanted to hear your thoughts.
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:22.560]   Basically, what I've got is I work a nine to five job. I've also got six rental properties and I've
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:29.520]   also got a cleaning company that runs. I don't do the cleaning, but I'm an owner in it. And so I'm
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:35.600]   just trying to decide where to focus, sort of maintain the intensity I've had over the last year
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:42.800]   and where to focus my efforts and finances. Recently I've heard you talk about the idea of
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:48.640]   having a significant amount of money in the bank, just as what that does in your spirit, just to have
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:53.520]   breathing room. And so I just, I don't know, do you have a thought on that or should I provide
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:58.160]   some more info? Absolutely. Well, first let me just clarify for those who are familiar with Dave
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:03.840]   Ramsey's baby steps. So again, Dave Ramsey, uber popular personal finance pundit and teacher. And
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:09.760]   so his seven baby steps, step one is to save a thousand dollars cash. Step two is to pay off
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:17.920]   all the debt, except your mortgage debt on your own personal residence, or possibly as you mentioned,
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:24.080]   possibly a mortgage on an investment portfolio. Step three is to fund an emergency fund with
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:29.040]   three to six months worth of expenses. And then step four is not pay off home. Step four is to
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:37.840]   invest 15% of your income for retirement. Then his step five is save money into ESAs or five to nine
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:42.640]   plans for college. Step six is to pay off the home early. And then step seven is kind of,
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:46.000]   doesn't really mean anything, get rich and give money. And I don't know what step seven is.
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:52.000]   So basically you've done all this stuff. So you said that you're considering paying off your home
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.240]   early. You didn't mention retirement. Was there a reason that you went straight to paying off your
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:02.560]   home? Well, I do have the retirement steps in place according to that plan. I mean, at this
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:07.200]   point it's 15%. Once your home's paid off, you step that up according to his plan. And I do have
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:15.120]   that in place as well. And also I've got five kids. So children's education is a fairly high
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:20.960]   priority in our home. And those I don't feel like I have as much of a question about. I feel like
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:27.680]   I've got a fairly good plan on that. In fact, when your episode to a 13 year old, my daughter
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:33.120]   lashed right onto that and has been researching CLEP and a number of other options to mitigate
[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:40.800]   the cost of college. So I feel like I'm good on those fronts. But what I'm wondering is,
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:50.240]   I know you mentioned when you had a home, you felt like the amount you put in a down payment
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:55.600]   ended up tying your hands later on. Yes. Yes. Okay. So I just wanted to be clear on that
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:59.120]   simply because you had jumped right to a question on paying off home, but you said you were through
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:04.080]   his baby step three. So there are a couple of ways to approach this. First of all,
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:09.280]   why would you focus intensely on paying off your home?
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:18.080]   The idea of not having that payment, which in Canada, we can't even write off the interest on
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:25.040]   our personal home. So there's really no, even the argument that those make about having an interest,
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:29.440]   you can write that off against taxes. In Canada, we can't on our personal residence,
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:36.000]   only on investment properties. So there's really not, I can't find any much value in carrying a
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:43.680]   mortgage other than I've got that, I don't have all the cash tied up in the personal residence.
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:52.080]   I run as the financial arm of the business. So when the business needs money, I front it. We
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:58.160]   try to run the business without debt. And as it continues to grow, there's going to be a continuing
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:03.760]   need for me to have money to inject at different times in that business. And so I'm just trying to
[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:11.200]   figure out if I need to, what's that really just whether to focus in on getting the mortgage paid
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:20.240]   off or whether I should also be building up a larger cash reserve. Okay, so that's why you
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:26.640]   would. Now, why wouldn't you focus heavily on paying off the mortgage? What would you do instead?
[00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:37.920]   Why wouldn't you choose to do that? That's a great question. Why would I not pay off the mortgage? I
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:44.400]   mean, I'm basically sold on the idea of paying off the mortgage and just wanted to get a second,
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:52.960]   get another opinion before I commit into that process. But can you think of any reasons why
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:12:00.480]   you wouldn't? Well, I mean, you know, keeping, I mean, I can build up cash on the outside and
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:05.760]   use that to grow a business. That would be a reason not to to immediately pay it off until,
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:12.400]   you know, the business reaches a whatever size within that. But other than that, I can't find
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:18.000]   a lot of good reasons to keep paying interest to the bank. So sounds to me like that. You answer
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.280]   your question then. And I'm not being a smart aleck when I say it that way. What I'm trying to
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:33.200]   get at is the specifics of your situation, why you would and why you wouldn't. And the answers to
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:41.520]   that question will determine what you should do, not somebody else's philosophy or framework or
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:47.200]   plan. Simple example. If you all of a sudden, let's say you have this excess money, but then
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:52.240]   if all of a sudden one of your children was injured in a horrible accident and you all of a
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:57.440]   sudden needed lots of extra money for medical bills, you would immediately stop paying extra
[00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:02.240]   on your mortgage and you would allocate that money towards the care of your child because you have a
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:09.600]   more important use for the money than paying down the mortgage quickly. That's just an example to
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:15.200]   prove the point that whether you should pay the mortgage off or not is primarily based upon
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:25.520]   whether you have a better use for the money. Now, I am 100% in favor of paying off all debt,
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:35.120]   and especially a personal mortgage, because when I look at the amount of peace and rest that that
[00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:42.000]   can bring to a family's finances, I see that as having a tremendous benefit, especially if you
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.520]   are in the stage where that's very valuable to you, meaning you're still working. What ages are
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:53.920]   your children? - We have one-year-old twins, and then the other three are eight, nine, and 12.
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:14:00.880]   - So at this stage of this one to 12 years old, having something like a paid-off mortgage would
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:06.240]   be extremely valuable to you. It would possibly open up opportunities for you to pull back if
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:10.320]   you wanted to pull back on your nine to five. It would bring a tremendous amount of peace to your
[00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:16.480]   wife. It would help her to feel much more confident and just at rest and secure, which could do wonders
[00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:20.720]   for your marriage and for your family life. It can free up some of your time and some of your
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:26.560]   expenses to be able just simply to pay out of your income for the expenses that your children need.
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:31.120]   If you didn't have a mortgage payment each month, you would be able to more easily write a check for
[00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:39.040]   football uniforms or ballet classes or write a check and take your children on nice experiences.
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:44.160]   If you know that you've accomplished those basic goals, hey, you're saving for retirement,
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:49.520]   if you're saving for retirement, you have your house paid off, you won't feel guilty about
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:53.760]   spending lots of money on your children, on great experiences. And I think that's something that is
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:58.640]   very, very important. During this stage of your parenting with children from one to 12,
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:05.360]   spending more money on them will be much more valuable than down the road. So it's better to
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:10.000]   figure out a plan where you can spend the money on them now, on experiences and the things that
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.960]   will really help them than you to just to be richer at 80 years old when they're grown and
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:19.360]   gone and on their own. So I can see a lot of arguments for paying off the mortgage. And I
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:26.960]   think that's a fantastic purpose. It's a fantastic goal to have, and it can bring tremendous benefits
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:31.760]   to your life. Now, the only reason why you wouldn't pay off the mortgage is if you had a
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:38.000]   better use for the money. And so you can do that in a financial calculation. The simple example
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:44.400]   would be in terms of the benefit, the cost of the financing versus the potential return of other
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:53.840]   investments. What is the current rate on your mortgage? Well, I am up around almost 4 percent,
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:58.080]   although that should be I'll be refinancing that in the next year. Okay. And you think you get
[00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:02.880]   below 4 percent if you were to refinance? Oh, absolutely. Yeah. I got to complete this term
[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:08.160]   and then I'll be able to. Yeah. Okay. So if you look at 4 percent now, as you mentioned, in Canada,
[00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:13.760]   you don't have the deductibility of the interest. And all that that does is it just changes the
[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:19.680]   actual cost of the interest for some U.S. Americans. So if there is a U.S. American who's
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:25.920]   listening to this and they do have the and we still have the home mortgage interest deduction,
[00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:31.040]   which is possible that it might go away in this next year with the forthcoming tax law changes.
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:36.480]   We don't know yet, but there are bills and suggestions sitting in committee right now in
[00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:42.960]   the Congress here in the United States that could result in that tax law being changed. And if your
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:48.000]   tax situation is such that you can benefit from itemizing that mortgage interest deduction,
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.600]   all that does is it cuts the net cost of the interest a little bit. So let's just say it
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:56.640]   cuts it from 4 percent to 3 percent. Well, you do the same exact calculation. You just factor that
[00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:01.440]   tax savings in. And this is one of my biggest pet peeves, is that when people recognize, oh,
[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:06.320]   my mortgage interest is deductible, they pretend that that means that there's no cost to it. Well,
[00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:11.760]   there still is a cost. It just means you have to adjust the nominal interest rate, which would be
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:18.240]   4 percent. You have to just the nominal interest rate by the value of the tax deduction in order
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:22.560]   to get your real interest rate. In my simple example, it would be 3 percent because of the
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:27.280]   value of the tax deduction. And then you would use that and compare it. So, David, for you,
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:31.280]   what you look at and if you're doing the financial analysis is you need to look at your life and your
[00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:38.640]   situation and say, do I have a place to invest this money that would get me in excess of 4 percent?
[00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:44.080]   So let me ask you that question. Is there a place in your life that if you just simply took the
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:48.400]   money that you would spend on paying off the mortgage and put it somewhere else that you could
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:53.040]   get a simple and easy and reliable rate of return that's in excess of 4 percent?
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:18:00.640]   There's lots of theoretical, but nothing that's going to be a guaranteed return.
[00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:03.440]   How about your rental portfolio? Do you have mortgages on your rental portfolio
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:08.960]   that are higher than 4 percent? Actually, all my rentals are lower. I had to do a little
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:14.080]   finagling to get the mortgage on the personal property because of the complications of the
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:19.200]   mortgages on the rental properties. So it was less than ideal terms when I got this house.
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:24.160]   So it's probably my weakest mortgage and most expensive in terms of interest.
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:29.840]   Okay. So that's tilting the favor very highly in terms of paying off the mortgage.
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:34.960]   If you don't have a reliable place where you could invest the money with a very high degree
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:41.040]   of confidence of earning in excess of 4 percent, given your investments, given your investing
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:46.480]   acumen, given your comfort, then that tilts the decision highly in favor of paying off the
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:50.880]   mortgage. Now, the reason I ask about the rental properties is because for most people, you can get
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:58.640]   a much lower rate of interest on your personal residence versus any mortgages or debt that you're
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:06.240]   servicing on a rental portfolio. And so in that circumstance, if you have what would be common
[00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:12.160]   in the United States here is that somebody has a 4 percent mortgage on their personal residence,
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:15.920]   but they're paying a 7 percent mortgage on a rental property. So in that case, I would
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:20.080]   seriously consider paying off the rental properties before paying off the personal
[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:24.720]   mortgage. But if your situation doesn't say that, then that's another mark in favor of
[00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:29.040]   the personal residence. Now, the only other so you want to answer the financial question,
[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:32.400]   which you've answered satisfactorily for now, if you come and think of it later,
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:38.480]   then you want to look at that. You want to think of it and ask yourself that question again. And
[00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:42.240]   if you come up with something that's better, you need to seriously consider that. So then the only
[00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:48.240]   other couple of questions you would ask yourself is ignoring the financial. Is there a place that
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:55.360]   you can invest the money that has a much higher potential in business? So as an example, do you
[00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:59.840]   have any interest in leaving your nine to five jobs in order nine to five job in order to be a
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:06.960]   full time real estate investor and or businessman? That is something I've been wrestling with. I have
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:15.760]   an entrepreneurial bent and definitely an interest there. I have been remaining with my current
[00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:24.320]   employer. I wouldn't say solely, but in large part because I feel we'll say a calling to remain
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:34.240]   there in this season until. As as a ministry field for myself, until I hear otherwise from
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:39.520]   from the Lord, we'll say. Sure, absolutely. And that's a very reasonable that's a very
[00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:43.120]   reasonable approach. So in that kind of circumstance, then you're basically in a
[00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:48.880]   holding pattern. You feel a burden to be where you are. You don't feel any freedom to go from
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:54.640]   there to something else. So you're not going to make active steps to leave because it's not just
[00:20:54.640 --> 00:21:00.000]   a matter of an intellectual. Well, I want to do this other thing. In many ways, I am in similar.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.320]   I'm in a very similar situation in some areas of my own life where there are things that if I were
[00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:08.640]   just choosing, I would say, well, I would like to do this, but I don't feel a freedom to do that.
[00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:14.400]   And so I consciously choose to suppress and subject my own will so that I can move in faith
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:19.040]   in the things that I do. So in that situation, then you would just consider, well, should I be
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:24.960]   making preparation? Should you be making preparation for possibly changing or is there something else
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:28.560]   that you can do that would change? Now, here's let me tell you why I'm going on this line of
[00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:34.080]   thinking. The reason I'm going on this line of thinking is so that you could consider and say,
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:39.280]   conference unlocked. Sorry about that. Just lost a couple of callers and I wanted to unlock it so
[00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:46.560]   they could get back in. The reason I go on that line of thinking is to emphasize that sometimes
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:51.760]   there might be if you were preparing to leave your job, let's say that you said, well, I'm doing this
[00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:59.840]   job, but I don't want to continue. I'm not going to continue this job forever. And I want to be
[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:06.080]   able to switch. Well, now if you look at your cashflow situation, you might need to invest the
[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:11.920]   money into your business. Perhaps you can purchase a little bit of advertising to bring on a few more
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:17.520]   accounts that would dramatically increase your cashflow. Or perhaps you look at some of your
[00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:22.720]   rental properties and say, well, if I pay off this mortgage here, then I can refinance this other one
[00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:26.960]   and then I can improve my cashflow situation. Because sometimes paying off a mortgage,
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:32.400]   especially if it's something like a low interest rate, fixed, low interest, fixed rate mortgage
[00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:37.520]   over a long term, paying it off doesn't buy you much additional cashflow. And so if it doesn't
[00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:41.600]   buy you much additional cashflow, then sometimes you would have to make a different decision to
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:46.560]   get you more cashflow. So consider that. And then the final area of consideration is just simply,
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:53.440]   is there a way in which your life would be improved from a safety perspective or from a lifestyle
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:58.560]   perspective with using this money in something, even if it's not the financially correct thing
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:07.520]   to do? And my example there is to say, would this be better served? Is there a better use for this
[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:12.880]   that if you bought a little vacation property or if you used it on some need that your family has,
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:16.720]   does that bring you more value than paying off the mortgage? After listening to you,
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:23.280]   I doubt that it is. It sounds to me like the right decision for you is to focus heavily and aggressively
[00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:28.320]   on paying off the mortgage. Now, if you did do that under your current assumptions, how long
[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:35.200]   do you think it would take you in order to be able to clear that mortgage debt? It'll depend on the
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:41.040]   rate of growth of the business, because I've basically got that business. I can focus 100%
[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:48.240]   of the income from that business on whatever the goal is. So I mean, my income there is about two
[00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:55.360]   grand a month right now. Plus, I can pull some from the personal. And it seems to be growing.
[00:23:55.360 --> 00:24:00.480]   So I expect that I'd be able to pay it off in probably, it might be five years, but I'd like
[00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:08.560]   to be less. What's the current balance of the mortgage? One, but 160. And what's the value of
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:16.240]   the house? Around 250. Okay. So yeah, if you've got a plan there, you just look at each amount
[00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:20.240]   of money and say, is there a way that I can get a higher return from the business? And that's where
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:26.320]   you've heard me say in past episodes, but I will repeat for you. I think there is a lot of value
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:33.440]   of accumulating the money. Instead of just chunking, let's say you have an extra $2,000 a
[00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:38.160]   month, instead of just chunking the $2,000 every month towards the mortgage, I think there's a
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:45.200]   huge amount of value of accumulating that outside of just in a separate checking account or savings
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:50.320]   account and planning to in the future, just write a check for the whole thing. That's probably the
[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:55.200]   biggest thing that I didn't realize in the past was how valuable it was to have lots of excess
[00:24:55.200 --> 00:25:00.080]   money, just simply sitting in a checking account. Especially if I were in your shoes, where I knew
[00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:04.880]   that there was a possibility that I might want to leave this nine to five job in the future.
[00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:09.520]   And if I knew that I'm trying to work on this business, I think I would prioritize setting as
[00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:15.440]   much excess money aside in just a savings account and not throw an extra $2,000 a month at the
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:20.960]   mortgage. That way I would be able to have the cash. It would be liquid for me to make investments
[00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:27.440]   into my business. And in the future, I can lower down the mortgage balance. The point of that is
[00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:34.080]   to show that there is no difference in terms of a risk profile, which most people want to pay down
[00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:40.080]   the mortgage because it lowers the risk of their life, bring security. If you have a $160,000
[00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:45.840]   mortgage, and let's fast forward at the end of two years from now, you've succeeded in putting
[00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:53.520]   aside a total of $48,000 towards that mortgage. So now you've dropped your mortgage balance from
[00:25:53.520 --> 00:26:00.000]   160 to $112,000. And then you get laid off. There's a big recession, you get laid off and
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:07.280]   you lose your job. In that circumstance, you're no safer than you were of having a $160,000 mortgage
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:11.600]   because you just have the standard monthly payment. Now, if you had done what I recommend,
[00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:19.440]   which is to put that $48,000 aside into a savings account, and you get laid off, well, now you're
[00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:26.400]   much safer because $48,000, let's say that your standard monthly payment is $1,000, $48,000 in
[00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:34.400]   the bank, even though you may still have $160,000 mortgage, that $48,000 buys you 48 months of
[00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:39.600]   mortgage payments. And so you're much safer having the money aside. That assumes that you don't spend
[00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:45.120]   the money. And that also assumes that you're able to maintain as high of a psychological motivation
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:50.960]   towards that goal. And that is actually what I see the biggest weakness in my suggestion,
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:55.120]   is for many people, when they can look at that statement every month, and I've been in this too,
[00:26:55.120 --> 00:27:01.040]   when I had a mortgage and when I was prepaying extra, it's very exciting to stay very focused
[00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:08.000]   on that goal when you can see the numbers dropping substantially. And so that keeps that intense
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.800]   emotional focus there for the family, for us to lower expenses in other places, because you can
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:17.680]   see it going down. So you have to judge for yourself, will it be psychologically motivating
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:21.920]   for you and for your wife to keep your expenses low so that you can get this mortgage cleared as
[00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:26.000]   quickly as possible? Because perhaps with this psychological motivation, you can have the whole
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.240]   thing gone in three years, just because you're very, very laser focused on it. And you're imagining,
[00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:33.680]   well, at that point in time, I have a 15 year old, I have some three year olds and children in
[00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:39.840]   between, we'll have that mortgage payment gone and we'll be totally free and available. You have to
[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:44.000]   decide that. I don't know of any way to give you advice. It's a matter of what you would find to be
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:50.160]   psychologically motivating. Absolutely. Thank you very much. That very much gives me,
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:55.920]   that's exactly the type of answer I was looking for of something that sort of approaches from a
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:28:01.040]   different angle than I was thinking. And so I appreciate that. We'll have to listen back through
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:05.360]   it with my wife and see what we can come up with. Absolutely. Thanks for calling in. Let's go next
[00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:11.520]   to Ursula in Hawaii. Ursula, welcome to Radical Personal Finance. How can I serve you? Hi, Josh.
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:16.800]   I am a long time listener, first time caller. It feels so strange for me to hear people say that,
[00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:21.840]   because that's always the thing you hear on talk radio. And it's so funny, but it's on my own show.
[00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:27.520]   So thank you for saying that. It's just so funny to me. Welcome. Thank you. So
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:36.720]   my husband and I are originally from California. And we have relocated to Hawaii because he found
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:44.960]   a job. We have a young eight month old. He is the best thing in our lives. But he kind of came to
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:51.440]   us as a surprise. And I'm in graduate school. It's still in California. And I've been going
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:58.800]   back and forth with a young baby that's really hard on our family. It's really hard for my
[00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:02.880]   husband to be apart from him for such a long period of time. In fact, I'm going back tomorrow
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:08.400]   to finish another semester. We did that last semester. And this semester, he got the job
[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:13.920]   here last semester. And basically, I wish I had found a show earlier, because instead of going
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:22.720]   to graduate school, I would have probably just kept working and saved my money. But so the problem,
[00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:29.440]   well, I guess it is a problem. What's going on? I'm sorry, I'm so nervous. No problem.
[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:42.960]   So I have, so I'm doing a master's in speech and language pathology, which requires an internship
[00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:48.800]   as well. And as I told you, I'm going back and forth between Hawaii and California. And
[00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:56.000]   my program is, there's a lot of hurdles to jump in order for me to do my internship here. So after
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.240]   the semester, I'll be done with all my classes, but I won't be able to do my internship. And so
[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:08.640]   I kind of feel like I don't really have, well, where I'm going with this is that
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:14.800]   I really admire your show and I'm rambling. Oh my gosh. Okay. I got to stop. You're going to,
[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:19.760]   are you going to ask a question? Is pathology, is speech and language pathology, is that
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:26.640]   where you're treating children or people who have speech impediments or problems? Or does
[00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:31.280]   pathology mean something different? What is speech and language? No, that's exactly it.
[00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:39.280]   So you treat children and adults that have speech and language issues. So children who
[00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:45.440]   have developmental disabilities and also adults who have had strokes or have some kind of
[00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:52.080]   degenerative condition or some type of traumatic brain injury. And how close are you to finishing
[00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:58.720]   your coursework? So my coursework will actually be done this semester. Like I said, I'll be going
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:06.480]   back and forth to finish up my classes. And, but I will need, I still have three more semesters
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:13.120]   of an internship to do. And why is it so difficult to find internships in Hawaii? Is there not
[00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:18.320]   the need for therapy? Is there, are there not a lot of other practitioners there?
[00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:24.320]   No, there are. It's just that my program is very specific about the place where I'm going to be
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:34.880]   doing my internship. And there's also, there's also the fact that they need their own supervisors
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:41.120]   to supervise me, you know? Sure, sure. And they need to come to the clinic site. But basically,
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:47.920]   I am very fortunate to be able to mostly stay at home with our son, with the exception of going
[00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:52.560]   to school a couple of days a week. And California is easier for us because we actually have family
[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:58.640]   members that help with him. Whereas I wouldn't be able to do this here if I was doing my internship,
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:03.760]   I'd have to find something on the weekend. But I would like to do, I have some ideas of
[00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:10.640]   about some lifestyle businesses, you know, like how you started your podcast.
[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:17.200]   I have some ideas about, you know, with my background, about what I can do. And the
[00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:22.720]   information I get online is just so overwhelming, because there's so much great things and so many,
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:29.120]   it's so much crap that's out there. Oh, yeah. But so I, like I said, I really admire your show and
[00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:34.240]   admire what you do and admire how you've been helping people. You certainly have helped me and
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:38.480]   give me some food for thought, even though I'm not at a point where I can actually implement
[00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:42.720]   some of the strategies you talk about. But I just I'm wondering about your
[00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:51.200]   creative process. And I know you've talked about in the show, how you prepared yourself to be in
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:55.440]   the position that you're in. And you had to like have a transition job for a little bit,
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:33:02.160]   because you're supporting your family. But in any case, I'd like to know more about that.
[00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:08.000]   Maybe I can make a decision about whether I'll stay here for a few years and work on that and
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.640]   then move back to California to finish my program down the road. Yeah, I'd be happy to tell you
[00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:16.880]   about that and give you some advice. With your permission, let me ask you just a couple questions
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:22.080]   about the California program. So your son is this is your first child for you and your husband?
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:29.520]   Yes. And so you were hoping to have children, but he came earlier than you planned. You were
[00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:33.680]   working towards finishing school, and then he showed up as a surprise. Is that accurate?
[00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:38.400]   That's accurate. Yeah. Okay. Now, if you given the fact that he's there,
[00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:46.560]   has that affected your career plans? Yeah, it has. I have always thought that I would
[00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:53.680]   stay at home with the children once I had them. But in my mind, I would have finished school,
[00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:59.520]   worked for a year, and then stay at home for the first five and figure it out from there. But that
[00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:05.200]   was something that I always was able to do. I always wanted to do, I'm sorry. And I'm very
[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:11.120]   fortunate that my husband is in a position that we can actually do that now. And since he's come,
[00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:17.920]   I would much rather not have to be in a position where I have to leave somewhere to go to work,
[00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:22.640]   especially being in Hawaii where I don't know anyone and leaving him with strangers.
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:30.320]   Is there any pressure, for example, from your parents or from other people? Is there any
[00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:35.040]   pressure as to why you need to finish your master's degree? Or if you do need to finish it,
[00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:41.680]   why you need to finish it on a certain time schedule? Yes. So there's several reasons why
[00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:47.200]   I'd like to finish my master's degree. There's certainly pressure, mostly because I've already
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:55.040]   I've already invested so much into it financially and also time-wise that I feel like,
[00:34:55.040 --> 00:35:00.640]   and it's also such a competitive program. I'm in such a fortunate position to be able to have
[00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:07.120]   gotten into it that I just kind of feel like it would be a waste if I didn't finish because I
[00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:13.200]   was given this opportunity. How much money and time have you invested into your master's degree?
[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:23.360]   So far, I have invested about, I want to say, $22,000.
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:28.640]   And how much money and time remains for you to be able to finish your master's degree?
[00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:35.600]   Well, so there's currently at this point, there's two years, one semester of classes,
[00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:42.000]   which is just coming up and then three of internships and probably another
[00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:54.640]   five, 10 grants. So let's first talk about that. I am a heretic when it comes to the modern kind
[00:35:54.640 --> 00:36:00.400]   of standardized acceptance of certain things, but I'm also not an irrational heretic. I recognize
[00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:05.520]   that you do need to consider the amount of time that you've invested. The first thing that I
[00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:11.520]   encourage people to do is to always practice what's called zero-based thinking, which means
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:18.320]   the answer to this question. Knowing what I now know, if I had to do it over again,
[00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:23.120]   is there anything that I would do differently? So let me ask you the question. Knowing what you
[00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:27.600]   now know, knowing that you're living in Hawaii and knowing that you have an eight-month-old son,
[00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:32.400]   if you were going to do everything over again, is there anything that you would do differently than
[00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:37.280]   what you've done or what you're doing currently? Yes. What would you do differently?
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:48.240]   Well, for one, you mean would I have done differently or would I be doing something
[00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:54.560]   different currently? You can answer whichever one you prefer. So yeah, I mean, knowing what I know
[00:36:54.560 --> 00:37:01.600]   now, I probably wouldn't have started the Masters. I would have worked at that point and saved money
[00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:11.920]   and that's probably what I would have done. Now, if you wouldn't have started the Masters,
[00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:16.640]   why? What's changed between when you started it and today that causes you to say, "Well,
[00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:21.360]   three years ago I really said this is important. I want to start the Masters, but today I don't."
[00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:32.240]   What's different for you? It's the time commitment that I have to put towards the Masters and also
[00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:39.680]   the monetary commitment because both take away from me being able to spend time with my son.
[00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:44.960]   Having spent that money, obviously, not obviously, but I had to get loans to do the program and then
[00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:50.400]   I have to pay them back. And so that would take time to clear up and also the actual time that I
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:56.880]   have to invest in studying, going to class, and commuting to and from school. Does this Masters
[00:37:56.880 --> 00:38:02.400]   degree, is it primarily oriented around preparing you for a career in speech and language pathology?
[00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:06.000]   Yes. Or is it primarily related to the career?
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.480]   Yes. Do you have any interest now that your son is here,
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:15.840]   do you have any interest in pursuing this career aggressively or have your interests changed?
[00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:23.280]   No, I don't have any interest in pursuing it aggressively. Once I finished the program,
[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:32.880]   my idea was to work very part-time and just as little as possible to meet our financial goals.
[00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:37.440]   Right. So let me just kind of give you some ideas, some things to think about
[00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:42.720]   around the concept of zero-based thinking. I won't be able to give you any answer, nor should I,
[00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:46.480]   because the answers are going to be intensely personal, but I can at least give you a few
[00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:52.560]   ideas and some things to think about. Zero-based thinking is an incredibly valuable thing to
[00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:59.360]   consider and it's very hard to consider. Zero-based thinking is also closely wrapped up with the
[00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:03.920]   concept of what's known as the sunk cost fallacy. And so this comes from the world of accounting,
[00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:10.880]   and it goes something like this. It says basically, well, in accounting, if we've spent money on
[00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:16.400]   something and it's not working very well, we need to continue spending more money on it.
[00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:22.000]   The idea is we invested, we had this new program for our business and for our company. We thought
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:28.400]   that if we could go ahead and launch this thing, it would do really well. So we've invested $50,000
[00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:33.680]   into it over the last few years. Now, things have changed and we look at it now and we say this new
[00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:40.000]   program for our company is not a good use of money. It's not going to result in a win. So the
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:45.280]   question is, what do we do now? Well, because we've spent $50,000 on it, it's very easy to look at
[00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:50.160]   that and say, I've got to get something out of this. I've got to make this work. And so we want
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:55.120]   to put more money into it. But this is a fallacy. And the reason it's a fallacy is because the $50,000
[00:39:55.120 --> 00:40:01.840]   is gone. It's been spent. It's a sunk cost. There's no way to get it back. And so today,
[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:06.960]   what we need to do is we need to start with a fresh decision and say, today, if we were knowing
[00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:11.120]   what we now know, if we were going to do this over again, would we put more money into it?
[00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:15.760]   That's got to be the question that we answer. If the answer is yes, then we go ahead and continue
[00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:21.600]   to pursue it. If the answer is no, then we should look to say, how can we end this program? And how
[00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:27.600]   do we get out as quickly as possible? So in investments, this is where you see this a lot,
[00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:33.040]   where an investor, let's say an investor is buying stocks in various companies. It's so easy for an
[00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:37.440]   investor to look at an investment that they have made and say, well, I've already invested this
[00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:42.320]   amount of money into this investment. And because I've invested this amount of money into it,
[00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:48.720]   I want to make sure that I get the full benefit out of my investment. So because I want to get
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:52.080]   the full benefit out of my investment, I've got to keep going. I've got to hold this,
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:56.960]   even though it's losing. Skilled and experienced investors have learned to come against this.
[00:40:56.960 --> 00:41:02.960]   You don't chase your losers. You don't put more good money after bad. You cut your losses. You
[00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:08.800]   say, oh, well, I lost money there, and I move on. So when we bring it over from-- in the world of
[00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:12.480]   finance, it's simple and it's relatively straightforward. When we bring it over from
[00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:17.040]   the world of finance and we start to look at our personal lives, it's much more difficult.
[00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:21.600]   But the concept still should be applied. And so that question that you ask yourself,
[00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:25.520]   which I learned years ago from Brian Tracy, is so phenomenal. It's something that should be
[00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:30.640]   asked about every single area of life, at your job. Knowing what I now know,
[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:37.200]   if I were going to take this job, would I do it again? If the answer to that is yes,
[00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:41.520]   then you know you're on the right track. Yes, I would take this job again. If the answer is no,
[00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:45.840]   then what you immediately start doing is you say, well, if I wouldn't take this over again,
[00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:50.880]   I shouldn't have it now. So how do I get out? How quickly can I get out? And what's the cheapest way
[00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:55.600]   for me to get out? It might be as simple as looking for another job. It might be as simple
[00:41:55.600 --> 00:42:00.640]   as looking and saying, well, let me go and switch within my company. You just look to change the
[00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:05.360]   situation. If you have an employee, knowing what you now know about this employee that you've
[00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:10.720]   hired, if I were going to hire them over again, would I do it? If the answer is yes, great. If
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:16.160]   the answer is no, you should immediately look into saying either, how do I change things so
[00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:21.680]   that the answer is yes, or most likely, how do I fire this employee as quickly and as simply as
[00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:27.200]   possible so that I can get something else in? The reason this is so important is because we all have
[00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:31.760]   a limited amount of time, a limited amount of money, and a limited amount of resources. And
[00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:37.040]   if we hang on to things that are not in our own personal best interest, then it keeps us from
[00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:43.280]   pursuing something that's better. So if we stay in a job that's only mediocre, that keeps us from
[00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:49.200]   pursuing a job that's perfect or that's ideal. If we stay in an investment that's mediocre,
[00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:55.440]   that keeps us from pursuing an investment that's fantastic. If we keep an employee that's mediocre,
[00:42:55.440 --> 00:43:01.200]   that keeps us from bringing in an employee that's fantastic. And so it's very important to always
[00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:06.640]   look at every aspect of our lives and to say, "Okay, knowing what I now know, if I were going
[00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:11.840]   to do this over again, is there anything that I would do differently?" And listen to those answers
[00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:15.840]   and again, start to make the changes. Now, let's bring it over to the question of education,
[00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:22.240]   careers, et cetera. You now have new information that you didn't have three years ago. Three years
[00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:27.760]   ago, you thought you had plan A, and today you have new information, you have a new plan. So
[00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:32.160]   when you have new information and you have a new plan, you have to sit down and you have to say,
[00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:38.320]   "Well, maybe I should make some changes." Now, the trouble with this, especially in this area for you
[00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:45.920]   is that this area that you're facing challenges in covers so many deep questions and deep concerns,
[00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:50.160]   and it's not just a matter of you. So let's just pretend that we're just a matter of you,
[00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:54.640]   and I'll sketch that out and we'll talk about some of the other pressures that are on you that come
[00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:59.840]   in externally. I faced this myself when I was pursuing a master's degree. At that time, this
[00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:05.520]   was a few years ago, I was with Northwestern Mutual, and because I was with Northwestern Mutual,
[00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:10.720]   I had the opportunity to have them pay for my education. So I had done a whole long list of
[00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:15.520]   credentials and designations and things like that, but then I got myself in the situation and I said,
[00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:19.440]   "Okay, I can go ahead and do a master's degree." And I thought it would be great. I'd have a
[00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:24.000]   master's degree and it would be paid for. Well, I came to the perspective, and as I started working
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:29.600]   my way through classes, I started Radical Personal Finance. And I got myself in a situation where I
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:33.600]   realized I didn't really care all that much about the master's degree. I wanted to start
[00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:40.560]   Radical Personal Finance. But by then I had already invested my time and my effort and my work into
[00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:45.600]   the classes and I was only a few classes away. And so I had the decision to make. I said, "Do I need
[00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:51.200]   to continue this or should I cut my losses and run?" Well, when I calculated it, it wasn't that
[00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:56.880]   I didn't value the master's degree at all. It was a matter that I didn't value it very much.
[00:44:56.880 --> 00:45:00.640]   But the actual benefit, I could get free of the master's degree and I could finish it pretty
[00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:05.920]   quickly. And so for me, I charted out a course and I said, "I'm going to give myself three months to
[00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:10.800]   finish this thing." And so I basically pulled back. I didn't really meet with clients. All I did was
[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:15.680]   study and pass exams for three months. And I finished that before I left to start Radical
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:20.560]   Personal Finance. I invested because I could do it. Now, I didn't really want to do that,
[00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:26.400]   but I recognized that the cost of finishing was pretty low and I had some value and some benefit
[00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:29.840]   for it. And I figured three months in the grand scheme of things was going to be an acceptable
[00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:35.920]   cost. For you, it's much more difficult because it's not three months. It's three years as you've
[00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:41.120]   etched out here. You have to do the coursework and then the internships, et cetera. Now, for me,
[00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:46.160]   it was easier also because I was going to use the master's degree. It would give me an aspect of
[00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:50.080]   differentiation. For example, I think best of my knowledge, I'm one of the few – well, now that
[00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:53.920]   Michael Kitsis has started a podcast, which by the way, those of you who have enjoyed Michael
[00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:58.000]   Kitsis and are a financial planner, we finally got him after two years of working on him, three years
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:02.640]   of working on him, he's finally got his podcast launched. But as far as I know, he's probably the
[00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:06.640]   only other podcast host that has a master's degree in financial planning. So I looked at that and
[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:12.640]   said, "Well, it'll be of some value to me to go ahead and have this master's degree." And it was
[00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:17.680]   also valuable for me as a point of differentiation. It was a fallback plan. If I failed building my
[00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:22.320]   lifestyle business, I could go back into the world of financial employment and I would be separate
[00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:27.200]   and distinct and have an additional competitive advantage based upon having the master's degree.
[00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:33.440]   So for me, that was a relatively simple decision. Now, for you, it may not be so simple because it
[00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:39.040]   sounds to me like your primary heart is towards your son, that at this point, your son's impact
[00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:43.600]   on your life has changed many other aspects of your life and now you're saying, "Well, I don't
[00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:48.640]   really want to go and do this full-time career of speech and language pathology. I don't really want
[00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:54.320]   to go and pursue this." So for you, things are different and a master's degree certainly doesn't
[00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:58.880]   contribute to the possibility of your being a better mother. It's not going to make you a better
[00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:02.240]   mother. It's not going to make a difference in your relationship with your son or with your
[00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:11.440]   children. Now, let's talk about... So for you, it could be very simple and I would encourage you
[00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:16.000]   and your husband to sit and think about this. If it were just you making the decision or better,
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:23.360]   just the two of you making the decision, would you decide on course A or course B and then factor in
[00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:28.080]   other people from an outside perspective? And here's what I mean. It sounds to me like your
[00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:36.000]   primary focus is on your son and your focus is your desire to be present in your home, to be there
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:40.560]   and work with him. And yes, you'd like to have some part-time income and some part-time career,
[00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:46.960]   but it's primarily focused on your home. The challenge is that there are other people
[00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:52.400]   involved in your life. So as a simple example, when my parents were younger, my dad was in the
[00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:56.720]   military, my mom was in school and she was in a similar position. They were living in Pearl Harbor,
[00:47:56.720 --> 00:48:01.120]   excuse me, they were living in Hawaii. He was stationed at Pearl Harbor for a time and she was
[00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:06.400]   in Hawaii trying to go to school and she had two small children at that point in time. Now for her,
[00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:12.320]   she needed, they had made an agreement with her parents that she would finish her college degree.
[00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:18.240]   So it wasn't easy, it wasn't fun, but she finished her college teaching degree because
[00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:22.720]   she had made that agreement with her parents as a component of their getting married. My dad had
[00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:27.600]   committed that yes, we'll make sure that she finishes her college degree and that was an
[00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:32.320]   important family commitment. And this similar things often occur in many families, especially
[00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:37.440]   with your being a woman. There's a lot of pressure from parents, et cetera, to make sure that their
[00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:43.120]   daughters are well-suited in a career with career skills, with marketable career skills,
[00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:48.640]   with an excellent education to be able to list at the bottom of resume in case their daughter is
[00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:53.520]   abandoned, in case your husband were to leave you and you were to find yourself as a divorcee
[00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:57.760]   trying to support your son and going out into the working world. And I don't think that's altogether
[00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:02.880]   bad, but that's one of the major pressures. There's also a major pressure on you societally
[00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:08.960]   that you have to recognize. And this is something that my wife has felt, most women have felt,
[00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:14.480]   where in the wake of the feminist revolution, which says women and men are equal and so therefore
[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:21.840]   every aspect of life should be the same, there's this intense focus on career and education,
[00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:27.200]   especially for women. That's why today a majority of... One reason why in colleges today,
[00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:34.320]   a majority of the attendees of college are female rather than male. Now, I think men feel this as
[00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:40.480]   well, but there is a social acceptance that's different from men versus women. And I think also
[00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:46.240]   men and women face a different feel, a different pool towards their children. And so you've got
[00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:50.560]   to look at this and say, "Am I trying to finish my master's degree because this is what will
[00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:57.040]   impress society? This is what will be culturally appropriate because I'm kind of the ideal modern
[00:49:57.040 --> 00:50:01.840]   woman. I have a master's degree, I have a high-powered career, and I'm a super mom. Or
[00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:07.120]   am I trying to finish my master's degree because it's important to me, for the reasons that it's
[00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:11.680]   important to me?" My experience, financial planning, is there have been many mothers that I
[00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:17.360]   have worked with who, when given the opportunity to answer that question free of social pressure,
[00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:22.960]   free of the social pressure to be super businesswoman and super mom, many of them have
[00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:29.600]   said, "You know what? I don't care about the world of the career. I care about being home with my
[00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:35.600]   family. That's where my primary care and importance is." But this causes you to go directly against
[00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:39.760]   the culture of our day, which can be very, very difficult. It's especially difficult when it comes
[00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:44.800]   down to spending money. I've done financial counseling with many couples who, because of
[00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:51.360]   the social pressure to be super mom and super career woman, have invested tens of thousands,
[00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:58.800]   hundreds of thousands of dollars into the mother's education. And yet then, a few years later,
[00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:02.320]   things have changed, and she says, "I don't really want to pursue the career. I don't want
[00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:06.800]   to do it part-time. I don't want to do it full-time. I want to be at home with my children."
[00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:12.080]   Well, in that circumstance, what was the benefit of spending $150,000? As I have sat there and
[00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:17.600]   looked at the financial counseling, $150,000 of debt at times. It's very, very difficult.
[00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:24.240]   So, it's not my place to tell you what to do or to even tell you how to do it, but I would
[00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:30.000]   encourage you and your husband to spend a lot of time thinking about the answer to that question,
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:35.520]   knowing what I now know. If I were going to do this over again, would I do it any differently?
[00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:42.000]   And incorporate into that all of the information, the fact that you have a beautiful baby boy now,
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:47.920]   the benefits of that, the benefits of that on your family. Factor into that your own personal desire,
[00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:52.960]   your own personal goals, how you and your husband are going to work and build your family
[00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:59.040]   lifestyle together. Factor into that the parental pressure and the social pressure, and decide for
[00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:06.080]   yourself what is the appropriate course of action. And don't bow your knee to an external pressure
[00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:12.160]   that doesn't involve your actual life. It's the same thing that any of us face. And so,
[00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:16.480]   I'm emphasizing here the social pressure on mothers because it's substantial,
[00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:20.800]   but we all feel the same pressure. An early retiree, somebody who chooses a lower standard
[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:26.960]   of living, so quote unquote, has to face the same thing. Do I value my time and my freedom,
[00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:32.240]   or do I value the higher income, et cetera? And then after going through that thinking process
[00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:36.320]   with you and your husband, after going through that process, I think you'll be able to figure
[00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:41.120]   out a better plan for this. And it may be a plan, for example, one thing that seems to me,
[00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:46.640]   it might be best for you to finish up your coursework because you're in that mindset of
[00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:50.800]   the academics of the coursework. And if you're close to finishing coursework, you've already
[00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:54.160]   invested this amount, perhaps it would be a really good idea for you to finish the coursework.
[00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:58.960]   And then perhaps you might look at that point into transferring. Maybe there's a transfer
[00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:03.440]   university that maybe it's not as prestigious of a program as the one you're in now,
[00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:07.600]   but at least it could be local. And then you could do your clinicals and your internships
[00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:10.720]   to be able to get some of the benefits. Maybe if you just finish the coursework,
[00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:15.440]   but don't even do the internship, you have that as a fallback plan, where if you decide that you
[00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:20.640]   do want to go back to it in the future, you want to enter that career, then again, you could just
[00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:25.440]   brush up on some of the changes in the coursework. If this is a year from now or 10 years from now,
[00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:29.440]   you brush up on the coursework, transfer your credits, your credits should transfer into a
[00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:34.000]   different university and do your clinicals and your internships. Maybe you should go ahead and
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:39.360]   finish, but maybe I know this is unlikely because you've just moved to Hawaii, but maybe there's an
[00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:44.720]   opportunity where you can go ahead and your husband can find a job in California that would
[00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:49.520]   allow you to finish it. Or maybe you just look at it and say, "Okay, you know what? It's only three
[00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:55.360]   years. Let me buckle down. We've only got another couple of years and another $8,000 to invest."
[00:53:56.240 --> 00:54:00.560]   And then we'll have it. That way, it's there as a backup plan. If you want to go back and do the
[00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:05.520]   career on a part-time basis, or if you want to dig into the career full-time, maybe when your
[00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:09.280]   children are a little bit older and aren't quite as dependent upon you, then you have it as a
[00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:13.440]   backup plan. I don't know the right solution, but that's how I would approach answering the question.
[00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:20.160]   - That's really helpful, Josh. It gives me different perspectives. And like you said,
[00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:28.000]   the societal pressure is really, really great, but it's also the fact that it's very important
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:38.560]   for me to, like you said, to stay at home with my son and devote my time to him, but having a fall
[00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:40.880]   back plan is really important to me. - Absolutely.
[00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:48.800]   - Which is why, so in the grand scheme of things, if I am not allowed, because I've looked into it
[00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:57.040]   and I can't really transfer to Hawaii to finish my program, but I was thinking we were just gonna do
[00:54:57.040 --> 00:55:02.720]   a back and forth thing for the next few years. I'd take a semester off here and there,
[00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:12.560]   just because it's hard on our family to be apart for so long. But so my main concern is my ability
[00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:19.600]   to help my husband achieve our financial goals, because that's something that we've talked a lot
[00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:27.200]   about. And he's helped me in achieving my goal of devoting my time to our son. And I feel like in
[00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:32.960]   our partnership, we've agreed that we would help each other out with our goals. And his main goal
[00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:42.160]   is to purchase a home. He really wants to buy a home. And so I would like to help him achieve that
[00:55:42.640 --> 00:55:49.920]   and so since we are gonna be going back and forth and I am gonna be taking a few semesters off here
[00:55:49.920 --> 00:56:00.720]   and there, ideally, I would like to devote my time while I'm here a few hours a week to starting a
[00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:05.840]   lifestyle business. So with the knowledge that I have, with the background that I have,
[00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:19.200]   utilize that in some way. And so yeah, and I think that that's where I'm headed towards,
[00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:26.960]   you know, and seeing where that goes and I don't know. But I'm not too sure about how to start it
[00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:33.680]   and how to go about it. - So let me just give you some ideas on that in terms of to focus.
[00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:38.880]   In general, the term, so the idea behind the term lifestyle business just simply means
[00:56:38.880 --> 00:56:45.680]   a business that is not an all-consuming obsession with growing big, but rather a business that's
[00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:52.640]   designed to bring specific benefits, monetary benefits, income to our family to enhance our
[00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:59.200]   lifestyle without causing major problems with our lifestyle. And in general, the place that you
[00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:04.960]   should start in looking for a lifestyle business is start by doing an assessment and an inventory
[00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:10.240]   of your skills and trying to figure out where, based upon my skills, my experience and my
[00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:14.240]   knowledge, how can I bring to the market something that is the most valuable. Now,
[00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:17.840]   if you have specialized education in the world of speech and language pathology,
[00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:27.440]   or if you are achieving it, make sure that you don't spurn that benefit. Lifestyle businesses
[00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:33.040]   are very difficult. Certainly, some people are able to take an education that they have worked
[00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:38.080]   hard to accomplish, especially as measured by a college degree, go into a completely unrelated
[00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:42.960]   field and make it big. But this is very, very difficult to do. And if you're gonna do it,
[00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:48.800]   my encouragement to you, if you're gonna finish the degree, make sure that you actually want to
[00:57:48.800 --> 00:57:54.720]   build a business in the degree. Otherwise, it's a waste of time and it's only a sunk cost fallacy.
[00:57:54.720 --> 00:58:00.720]   So if you're gonna go three years more and be apart from your husband, have the challenge of
[00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:04.720]   how to do that, make sure that you're at least gonna use the degree. Otherwise, better to cut
[00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:09.600]   your losses and go get a real estate license and build a lifestyle business selling real estate so
[00:58:09.600 --> 00:58:14.640]   that you can find an undervalued property in your local area to get a discount, negotiate it on the
[00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:22.160]   private market, achieve your family goal of buying a house, if that's the primary financial goal.
[00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:27.200]   Much better off having a lifestyle business as a real estate agent than a speech and language
[00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:32.560]   pathology degree if you're not actually gonna work in it. So a big litmus test for me, if I were
[00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:37.680]   giving you personal counsel, I would say, if you finish this thing, you better be convinced you're
[00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:43.360]   gonna use it. Otherwise, cut your time and don't waste another three years doing this if it doesn't
[00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:47.840]   fulfill your long-term goal. Now, let's assume for a moment, 'cause it sounds to me like it's
[00:58:47.840 --> 00:58:54.000]   important to you both as a backup plan for your own knowledge, education, career plans, etc. It
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:57.680]   sounds to me like it's important to you to finish it and you're probably gonna figure out a way to
[00:58:57.680 --> 00:59:02.880]   do that. Well, in that context, make sure that you're building a lifestyle business with that
[00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:07.520]   speech and language pathology degree. And you can do this. One great benefit to having this
[00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:12.640]   certification is you can charge a very high hourly rate. I have a friend of mine who does this. You
[00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:18.320]   can work part-time. You can establish yourself part-time and gain a very high income on an hourly
[00:59:18.320 --> 00:59:24.480]   rate, which will help you and your family and your financial goals based upon that. And you can do it
[00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:30.160]   with a high degree of flexibility. So focus on that. Now, you probably will need to work with
[00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:35.360]   a clinic, obviously, to have the internship and to have the supervisory requirements of your
[00:59:35.360 --> 00:59:39.840]   internship program met. But then look to see, is there a way that I could do this from Hawaii?
[00:59:39.840 --> 00:59:43.440]   And so what I would be looking at over the next few years is I would be looking at,
[00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:47.600]   if you, you know, people often think of the internet, I think you should. Is there some way
[00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:52.880]   that you can offer speech and language pathology at a discounted rate through the use of Skype,
[00:59:52.880 --> 00:59:57.840]   through the use of video conferencing, that this will allow you to reach clients in other places
[00:59:57.840 --> 01:00:04.160]   in the world in a different way? And based upon the Hawaii time zone, is there a way that you can
[01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:09.680]   take advantage of the Hawaii time zone in order to work with clients in another place that would
[01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:15.040]   work around your son or work around your family schedule? So make sure that your lifestyle
[01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:19.120]   business, if you're going to finish the degree, make sure your lifestyle business is entirely
[01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:26.800]   focused on that. There's no shame as an adult in quitting something because your goals have
[01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:31.840]   changed. The only shame in quitting is if you're quitting because you have the same goal, but
[01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:35.680]   somehow, you know, you don't want to follow through. But there's no shame in quitting if
[01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:39.760]   your goals have changed. If you're going to do this, Bill, I would, how I would start, I would
[01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:44.400]   be establishing myself as a thought leader right now. I would be taking all of my education and my
[01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:49.600]   experience in learning speech and language pathology. And if I woke up in your shoes and I
[01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:54.800]   wanted to build a lifestyle business in that, I would be seeking to teach parents what they needed
[01:00:54.800 --> 01:01:01.920]   to do to avoid my services. And I would teach those parents everything that I knew about speech
[01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:06.480]   and language pathology techniques. Or if, let's say, you're working with somebody who's trying to
[01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:11.440]   help their spouse recover from a stroke or trying to help their parent be able to speak more clearly
[01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:17.760]   in wake of a medical event, I would give every bit of helpful information that I could for free. I
[01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:22.400]   would, if it started a podcast, I would create training materials on YouTube, etc. And what I
[01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:28.400]   would be doing is two things. Number one, the more you give away for free, the more the people that
[01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:35.120]   value time more than money will want to hire you. You can go on the internet and you can find every
[01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:40.800]   bit of information that you need in order to fix your car. But just because it exists out there,
[01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:46.240]   doesn't mean that every single person is going to go and do it for free. Many of us value our time
[01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:52.880]   more than we value the cheapness of fixing it ourselves. And so a mechanic, the best thing a
[01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:58.240]   mechanic can do is give away all the information and then their potential customers will just bring
[01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:02.000]   the car and say, "I don't want to do it. Can you just do it for me?" And so you should approach
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:06.800]   your business in the same way. Give away and teach, and then the people who want to buy will
[01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:12.400]   come to you and say, "Will you do this for me?" And then secondarily, you can prepare carefully
[01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:17.760]   built out materials to teach people with the use of products and courses like I do here on Radical
[01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:23.360]   Personal Finance. I give away everything for free. So those who have a lot of time to dedicate can
[01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:28.960]   get all the benefit for free. And that's great for a 13 year old who's listening to my show,
[01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:33.440]   who has time and not a lot of money. But if I come in and somebody is 36 years old,
[01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:37.200]   they don't have time to listen to my whole archive of shows, even though it's all for free.
[01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:43.280]   They would rather spend $100 and get a clear, concise summary that's useful to them that they
[01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:48.000]   can act on versus go and spend 100 hours listening to something to gather it together. So you can do
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.560]   the same thing as you build your lifestyle business. That's how I'd approach it.
[01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:56.560]   Josh, you have been so wonderful. Thank you. It's so refreshing to get advice
[01:02:56.560 --> 01:03:05.040]   from a different perspective, something not so mainstream, because if you don't really have,
[01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:11.280]   don't really look at things differently. And just in general, it's just so refreshing.
[01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:16.160]   Good. I appreciate the compliment. The subject even that we talked about here,
[01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:21.040]   in terms of your career, when you asked the question of husbands and wives,
[01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:28.800]   when I raised the word feminism, I opened myself up to being beat upon by the modern culture.
[01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:33.440]   But having worked as a financial planner, I am convinced that for many people,
[01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:39.120]   for many moms especially, who have a deep heart to want to be with their children,
[01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:44.400]   it is incredibly freeing for them just to say, "No, I actually really want to be with my children."
[01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:50.080]   And I get so sick and tired of the pressure that's brought to bear on women to be supermom.
[01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:55.680]   And when I look at my wife and the work that she does, I don't know how she could possibly
[01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:59.680]   integrate into that a money-making career and be as effective as a mother.
[01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:06.160]   So I have no interest in going out and telling people what they should do. As far as I'm
[01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:10.000]   concerned, you can arrange your relationship with your husband and your relationship with
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:15.440]   your children pretty much however you want to do it. That's not my business. But I do get
[01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:24.640]   frustrated that you have to overcome this intense social pressure when, to me, I look at it and say
[01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:31.760]   it's much simpler. It's much simpler if you just recognize what's more important. And I do it with
[01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:35.760]   fear and trembling because I don't know how to give advice in this area without knowing somebody's
[01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:43.920]   intentional areas. But anyway, so I do it with fear and trembling. I hope it's useful to you to
[01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:49.760]   consider and in conversation with your husband, I'm confident that you'll figure out the right path.
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:56.720]   Sometimes you can buckle down. I'll just finish the story with my mom when she was younger,
[01:04:56.720 --> 01:05:02.320]   when she was finishing her college degree. At that time, my dad was in the Navy and he was in
[01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:08.560]   the submarine forces. And they would go out for six-month cruises. And so he was gone for six
[01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:14.320]   months at a time. And he went on three individual cruises during that time, which he was stationed
[01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:22.880]   in Pearl Harbor. And it was not easy. Frankly, I am amazed, especially in the military. I don't know
[01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:30.480]   how any military marriage can survive. I don't know how. I think it's possible. Some do, but I
[01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:35.280]   don't know how. It's only by the grace of God that a military marriage can survive. And my parents'
[01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:41.520]   marriage certainly was tested. But in hindsight, recognizing the investment that was needed to be
[01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:47.040]   made, this was important and they found a way to make it work. And a lot of people can find ways
[01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:51.840]   to make it work. Not necessarily fun, but that can give you a lot of motivation to get it done
[01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:56.480]   quickly. And so if you need to do that, if you need to keep an apartment in California and fly
[01:05:56.480 --> 01:06:00.800]   back and forth, just look to get it done as quickly as possible. And if you are going to do that path
[01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:06.640]   and finish this out, I would encourage you to do it as quickly as possible because your son has an
[01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:12.720]   intense need for you at eight months, but he also has a much more intense need for you almost at two
[01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:16.960]   or at three. At eight months, yes, he's communicating, but his communication is much
[01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:23.120]   more minimal than at two. So the quicker you can get it done in some ways, the better. What that
[01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:27.040]   looks like, I don't know. Lean on your family network, lean on your friend's network, try to
[01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:34.160]   minimize the cost as much as possible, but you'll figure it out. Thank you so much, Josh.
[01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:35.280]   Thanks for calling in, Ursula.
[01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:43.840]   All right. Well, talk about going to difficult subjects. Well, the name of the show is Radical
[01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:48.720]   Personal Finance. So hopefully those were helpful calls to you. I encourage you on today's. There
[01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:52.800]   were a couple more callers that dropped off during the call. If you would like to join on a call like
[01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:58.480]   this and have a conversation with me, I would welcome you to. I really enjoy that. And at the
[01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:02.320]   moment, it's only open to patrons. But as you can tell, if you'd like to be on and discuss the
[01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:09.840]   details of your situation, please come by and join. RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron.
[01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:16.720]   Take the output from these calls and don't try to think in terms of the individual caller's
[01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:22.960]   perspective. Think and try to seek how to apply the thinking process behind those callers to your
[01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:28.400]   own life. Even in terms of thinking about Ursula's question where she's talking about, "Well, what do
[01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:34.640]   I do? How do I handle this?" You may be facing a similar situation. And in many of these situations,
[01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:39.600]   there's no objectively right answer. The only right answer is based upon a prioritization of
[01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:46.000]   what's important to you. I could see very easily why you would go one way or the other. For you,
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.680]   you might, by asking that zero-based question thinking, just look and say, "No, I don't care
[01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:55.040]   about this degree. Chuck the thing and move on." Remember, half of college students drop out and
[01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:59.600]   don't finish their degree. That's the data. And in the long run, it really doesn't matter
[01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:06.160]   for so many people. My mom, in the circumstance I described, yeah, she finished her teaching degree.
[01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:12.400]   To this day, she's never... Just making sure I'm right. Yeah. To this day, she's never used it.
[01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:16.560]   So it was important to finish because it was part of a commitment that she made to her parents.
[01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:22.880]   It was important to them, especially as a wife and mother, that she have that. Many mothers have
[01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:27.600]   needed that in terms of when they were abandoned by their husband. They needed that educational
[01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:32.720]   background to make sure that they could support their family. But in hindsight, would their life
[01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:38.000]   be any different if she hadn't done it? I don't think so. But on the flip side, some people,
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:42.720]   it's very important to them. They are going to aggressively pursue their career. So make sure
[01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:47.040]   that you take the information and you apply it to your situation. Ask yourself that zero-based
[01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:51.200]   thinking question. Knowing what I now know, if I were going to do it all over again,
[01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:56.960]   is there anything I would change? If so, get about changing it as quickly as possible.
[01:08:56.960 --> 01:09:02.800]   Oh, and please go take my survey, radicalpersonalfinance.com/survey.
