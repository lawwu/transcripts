[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:21.440]   Welcome back to Portfolio Rescue. We always appreciate your questions, comments, feedback.
[00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:27.000]   Email us, askthecompoundshow@gmail.com. Duncan, hit us with that liftoff video. We have to
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:43.200]   see it. Gotta fade the music first. Okay, let's do it. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0. Liftoff. Liftoff.
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:52.120]   30 minutes to after the end. So I get the koala bear. You know, well, that's what people
[00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.720]   like about it. You know, I thought that people would be tired of it. There's a lot of requests
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.320]   for the koala bear now. I'm bullish on koalas. We've got a new one at our zoo here. Today's
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.800]   Portfolio Rescue is sponsored by Liftoff. Duncan, I created a Liftoff account for myself
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.020]   and my wife two or three years ago. And since it's powered by Betterment, what you can do
[00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.360]   is create your own goals. And I just created a goal for each one of my children. So there's
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.480]   a George, a Kate, and a Libby, all three of my kids. And I created a sub-account for each
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.740]   of them because I want to teach them the value of compound interest. I want to show them
[00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.760]   like cost and value over time. So I'm investing just a little bit in there, 50 bucks a month,
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.520]   let's call it, each month for them. And then I'm matching anything that they put in there.
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.800]   So I told my daughter, "Listen, you get 40 bucks for your birthday. Take half of it.
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.000]   Spend it on yourself. Buy your little toys. But then take 20 bucks, and I'm going to match
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.600]   20 bucks. That's 100% return." So I'm trying to incentivize them to save. I'm trying to
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.560]   introduce them to the financial markets to show, maybe I should show them now. I should
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.400]   show them their accounts now to show them they're down. Then I want to establish a little
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.240]   baseline for them. So when they go out into the real world, they're 18 or 21 or however
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.480]   old they are, when they finally are out of my hair, maybe a down payment for their first
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:59.120]   place, wedding, that kind of thing, first month's deposit, maybe three beers in Brooklyn
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.840]   if they move to New York, that sort of thing. So if you want to learn more --
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.600]   It's nice you're not even taking a tax cut or anything, you know?
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.080]   No, I'm giving them more money. I'm like their 100% 401(k) match. Liftoffinvest.com, if you
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.080]   want to learn more, you can talk to an advisor there. You can set up an automated account.
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.080]   It's pretty sweet.
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.680]   So last week, we kicked off the show with a question from a young viewer who said, "This
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.800]   is my first bear market. Are they all like this?" And we gave some advice to young people,
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.200]   which is actually relatively simple in these times. It's just Nick Majulia, his book, Don't
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.720]   Stop Buying or Just Keep Buying. That's pretty much it. You don't stop investing because
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.320]   there's a bear market. You actually want to keep investing for sure then.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.840]   So the advice for young people is pretty simple. Keep saving. Don't get scared out of the market.
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.200]   And then, of course, we had a couple retirees who said, "That's great. That's easy for young
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.360]   people. Not easy. Simple, but not easy for young people." What do you say to retirees
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.200]   dealing with this? "I don't have the human capital anymore. I'm not saving. I don't have
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:57.020]   as much time. And I'm dealing with this bear market in stocks and bonds. What do you think?"
[00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:02.000]   And so, here's what I tell a retiree. The good news is, the returns for a diversified
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.640]   investor have been lights out coming into this year. So I just looked at the simple
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.620]   three-fund Vanguard portfolio. So you have U.S. Stock Market Index Fund, International
[00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.960]   Stock Market Index Fund, Total Bond Market Index Fund. That's a three-fund Vanguard portfolio.
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:22.320]   Through year-end 2021, before this year, over ten years, that portfolio of a 60/40 three-fund
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.960]   Vanguard was like 8.5% per year. For 60/40. And that's a time when bonds did pretty terribly.
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.640]   So obviously, if you had more stocks, you did much better. That portfolio was down almost
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.960]   20% this year. So that's what people are saying. "This is terrible. I just retired. What now?"
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.060]   Even if you include the 20% down this year, over the last ten years, it's still up 5%
[00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.460]   per year. That's with two bear markets and bonds giving you basically nothing. So, if
[00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:50.340]   you are more heavily in stocks, since 2012 the S&P is up like 12.5% per year. That's
[00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.700]   with this bear market. At the lows. Russell 2000 is up almost 10% per year. International
[00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.100]   stocks haven't done quite as well. So, here's the thing. If you're a retiree, you've been
[00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.120]   building up financial assets for a while, you did pretty well heading into this thing.
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.580]   So this is just kind of the other side of those wonderful returns that you experienced
[00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:11.420]   to this point. If you own your home, you have a massive amount of equity in it. Right? Maybe
[00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.300]   housing prices roll over a little bit. You've seen such huge gains there. You're doing fine.
[00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:19.340]   It's no fun to see the value of your portfolio, of your house go down a little bit, but the
[00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.140]   gains you've experienced in the last 10 or 15 years should more than make up for any
[00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.380]   losses you've seen this year. Plus, there's some silver lining to the carnage this year.
[00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.400]   It's no fun, because that other side of your portfolio, the anchor bonds, have not helped
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.420]   much, if you've had any duration on. But yield was back for the first time in a long time.
[00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:40.780]   So a year ago, these are the yields for short-term bonds, corporate bonds, and high-yield bonds.
[00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.980]   Short-term government bonds yielded about 30 basis points. Corporate bonds were a little
[00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:49.740]   over 2%. High-yield bonds, 4.4%. One year ago from today. Today, short-term government
[00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:55.100]   bonds yield 4.4%. So in one year, short-term government bonds now yield what high-yield
[00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.500]   bonds were earning a year ago. High-yield is now 9%. Corporate bonds are approaching
[00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:05.340]   6%. Muni bonds, you can probably get anywhere in the 5 to 7% range, on a tax equivalent
[00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:11.900]   basis. And you have these Treasury Inflation Protected Securities tips that we're going
[00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.340]   to talk about in a question in a minute here. So, as a retiree, you finally have higher
[00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.660]   expected returns in the safe part of your portfolio. So, yes, you've had to deal with
[00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.740]   some losses to get there. But now, I think you can actually look at this, and for the
[00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:27.460]   first time in, I don't know, 12, 15 years, say, "There's a safe part of my portfolio
[00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.500]   I can actually put some money in that's giving me some yield, where I don't have to take
[00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.180]   all this volatility." So, as a retiree, yes, you're dealing with losses, but you're actually
[00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:39.060]   in a much better position today than you were a year ago, taking away the losses. So, going
[00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.180]   forward, you're in a much better position today.
[00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:47.140]   Yeah. It's crazy to see the way that the questions change over time. We're seeing a lot more
[00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:52.500]   bond questions, a lot more tips questions now. There, for a while, it was like, bonds
[00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.780]   were so uncool, left for dead, no one wanted anything to do with them.
[00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:59.380]   And they were kind of dead. And bonds didn't do much. And obviously, now they've lost money.
[00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:05.740]   But now, finally, you can have some 4-6% yield in relatively safe bonds. Obviously, if interest
[00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:09.420]   rates keep going up, that's going to ding you a little bit. But if interest rates keep
[00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:12.780]   going up, guess what? Your future returns are going up as well. So, I think the first
[00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:16.360]   one here we have about tips, actually, we've talked about them a little bit in the past.
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.180]   Let's get into the first one here.
[00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:22.020]   Yeah. This is a segue. Okay. So, Seamus writes --
[00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.420]   I'm a pro, Duncan. I'm a pro.
[00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:28.060]   Seamus writes, "I'm a new investor and still building up my emergency fund and paying off
[00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:32.940]   debt. I just discovered Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, or TIPS, and I'm thinking
[00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:38.060]   of diverting my monthly emergency fund payments going forward into a TIPS ETF in my Roth IRA
[00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:42.020]   account. I'm not currently maxing out my Roth, and I see this as a good low-risk way to max
[00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:46.580]   it out, but the yield seems too good to be true. Am I missing anything? For context,
[00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:52.340]   I'm a government employee with a solid pension that would pay out 76% of my final take-home
[00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:57.820]   pay every year once I retire at 62, 2% for every year worked. I'm also starting to put
[00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:04.340]   money into a 457(b), so any money in the Roth would be a bonus." I don't know what a 457(b)
[00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:05.980]   is, I've got to be honest.
[00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:09.060]   No. 457 is like a 401(k) for non-profits, essentially.
[00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:13.460]   Oh, I thought that was 403(b). So, there's another one. Okay.
[00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:15.300]   Oh, yeah. Okay. I think it's more of a government one.
[00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:16.580]   I don't know what this one is.
[00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:20.180]   Also, Seamus, great name. Duncan, you went to Scotland, right, for your honeymoon a little
[00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:21.180]   bit?
[00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:22.180]   I did.
[00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:23.180]   There had to be a lot of Seamuses there, right?
[00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:24.180]   Probably.
[00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:28.420]   Okay. All right. So, if you missed out a few weeks ago, I think it was the episode we did
[00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:32.140]   with Josh. We did a tutorial on tips, and someone asked us at the time, "Why are tips
[00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:36.780]   down when inflation is higher?" We did a whole thing on that. The short answer is, interest
[00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:40.100]   rates have risen. But the nice thing about rising rates for bonds, as I kind of mentioned
[00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:43.980]   a little bit ago, is eventually those higher yields turn into higher future returns.
[00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:48.620]   So, John, let's do a chart on for the five-year tips yield. So, this is from the Federal Reserve.
[00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:54.340]   You can see this is since 2010. And these are the yields on tips. And what this essentially
[00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:59.300]   is showing you is a yield on tips with, again, this is Treasury Inflation Protected Securities.
[00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:04.500]   The yield you get here, you tack on inflation to it. So, you can see, throughout from 2020
[00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:11.380]   through late 2021, you were getting negative yields in tips. And so, it was close to -2%,
[00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:15.420]   and then you could add inflation on top of that. So, if your yield was -2%, you're basically
[00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:19.820]   buying that bond at a discount. And then, if inflation was 3%, your total return would
[00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:23.780]   be 1%. Well, now, yields in tips, because interest rates across the board have come
[00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:29.540]   up, they've gone from -2% to almost +2% in a hurry, because rates are rising everywhere.
[00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:33.220]   So, what does this mean? It means tips are way more attractive. We haven't had yields
[00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:39.500]   this high since pre-Great Financial Crisis. So, why does this matter? Well, back when
[00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:44.700]   yields were -2%, even higher inflation would be eaten up by that. So, now you have +2%
[00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:50.360]   plus inflation. So, that means your starting point is 4% higher from expected return level
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:55.380]   in a little less than a year. That's how much rates have come up. So, let's say the Fed's
[00:08:55.380 --> 00:09:00.220]   able to bring inflation under control, and they get it down to 3% or 4%. Interest rates
[00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:05.980]   just stabilize. They don't go down, they don't go up. We're talking about a 5% or 6% expected
[00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:10.020]   return in tips, taking away the variability of interest rates and inflation and all these
[00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:14.900]   things. That's amazing, when you think about it. Or, let's say they're not as successful.
[00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:19.820]   Inflation is 4% or 5%. I think this is a wonderful -- so, the general rule of thumb for tips
[00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:26.700]   is, if they get to a 3% to 4% nominal yield, that's like a screaming buying opportunity.
[00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:30.140]   Because if you add inflation onto that, that's about as good as you're going to get. That's
[00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:33.740]   very rare. The last time it happened in the last 20 years or so was 2008, and that was
[00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:39.620]   a brief period, because people were throwing the baby out with the bathwater. I don't know
[00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:43.500]   how that became a financial saying. Does that happen?
[00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:48.140]   I think it must have happened. For people to say it, it must have happened at some point.
[00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:54.500]   Back in the day. So, it's very rare. And even 2% is relatively rare. I honestly wouldn't
[00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:57.820]   expect these yields to last very long. 2% in tips is pretty darn attractive for me.
[00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:02.100]   Now, there are some caveats, because Seamus is asking, "Should I use this for my emergency
[00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:05.340]   fund?" There is some variability here. We talked about this. Tips can lose money. The
[00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:10.740]   thing is, with a 2% yield and inflation as the kicker, you have a much bigger margin
[00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:15.860]   of safety now if rates continue to rise. So, yes, inflation protection is nice, but these
[00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:19.420]   securities can be volatile. So, I've mentioned this before. It probably makes sense to stick
[00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:22.700]   with a short-term tips fund. You can get these at any fund provider, iShares or Vanguard
[00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:27.420]   or Charles Schraub or whatever. It's also possible these rates would fall during a recession,
[00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:30.460]   which would actually help push prices up, but then it could hurt your yield from there
[00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:35.540]   after that. So, I don't know. We're in a very weird place right now in the markets, but
[00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:41.180]   this is the first time in a long time I've actually felt pretty good about bonds. And
[00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:46.500]   at least in the short to intermediate term, if I ever get bullish on something, which
[00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:51.860]   is rare, I'm probably more bullish on bonds than anything, which maybe is a reason to
[00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:57.020]   go against me here. But there's a lot of places to park your cash now. You have a lot of options.
[00:10:57.020 --> 00:11:01.860]   So, tips as an inflation hedge makes sense, even though it can be a little volatile.
[00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:06.220]   You're kind of looking like a hedge fund manager today. Maybe you should launch a bond hedge
[00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:07.220]   fund?
[00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:10.660]   I told you. The only reason I'm wearing my vest today is because it's a little chilly
[00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:15.700]   out, which, let's be honest, a vest, it's a useless article of clothing. I mean, it
[00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:20.380]   keeps your chest and your stomach warm, but your arms are just free. Your arms are still
[00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:21.380]   cold.
[00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:24.900]   In New York, I feel like it's useful because I see people and I'm like, "Oh, they probably
[00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:25.900]   work in finance."
[00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:33.580]   The only reason I'm wearing -- I had a little chicken, egg, and cheese sandwich from Chick-fil-A
[00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:37.180]   this morning, and I looked down right before we did this and I had a piece of cheese just
[00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:39.380]   all over my shirt. So, that's why the vest is on.
[00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:40.380]   We appreciate the vest.
[00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:42.940]   All right. Next question.
[00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:48.420]   Up next, we have a question from Webb, who writes, "The setup. In 2020, my wife and I
[00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:54.920]   bought a home and took out a $550,000 jumbo loan at 3.25%. Part of that loan required
[00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:59.620]   us to give additional financial info so we could get a lower rate and our mortgage could
[00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:03.780]   be sold individually. Basic finance tells us that interest rates and bond prices are
[00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:09.180]   inverted and as interest rates are mooning, that would theoretically devalue our single
[00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:15.520]   home mortgage bond. The 30-year treasury is 3.6% risk-free. Who's going to want our mortgage
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:19.820]   on the books? The idea, if we were able to come up with the funds, we could go into the
[00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:26.300]   market and buy our own mortgage at an increasing discount, if we could, it would essentially
[00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:34.020]   end our mortgage, right? And the value we would gain would be the 3.25% interest, original
[00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:37.940]   loan amount, minus current market value of loan. Am I big-braining this too much?" I'm
[00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:41.460]   going to say yes, because I don't even understand what this question is, hence me having trouble
[00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:42.740]   even reading it.
[00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:46.900]   Lewis: All right. The general idea here -- and I've heard a lot of people actually say something
[00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:51.260]   like this. The general idea is, interest rates on government bonds and all these other things
[00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:56.220]   are now higher than the mortgage rate, right? That puts you in a great position. John, do
[00:12:56.220 --> 00:13:00.940]   the chart on. This is from John Burns, they're a realty research company. The distribution
[00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:05.620]   of primary residences with different rates for their mortgage, and you can see 73% of
[00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:12.820]   outstanding mortgages are locked in at below 4%. A third are below 3%, and 40% or so are
[00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:18.840]   3-4%. So, the idea that government bonds are now yielding more than your mortgage puts
[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:24.180]   you in a good position. A lot of people think, "Well, geez, if I just bought a 3.5-4% mortgage,
[00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:29.780]   I could essentially pay myself for free, and the income I earn on that bond would essentially
[00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:33.740]   pay for my mortgage." Which sounds awesome in theory. I think they are big-braining this
[00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:40.100]   a little bit too much, because, I mean, let's just think about this here. First of all,
[00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:43.980]   you probably couldn't get in there and buy your own mortgage, and I don't know why. That'd
[00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:49.940]   be kind of weird, because they package these together. But let's say you could. A 30-year
[00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:57.580]   treasury is yielding around 3.5%. You buy that bond, and the income pays for your mortgage.
[00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:00.620]   But here's the thing you're not thinking about. You have to pay taxes on that income. So,
[00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:03.700]   every year, you're paying taxes, so that kind of eats into your yield a little bit. You
[00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:07.980]   think you could probably make more. The other thing is, you have to actually have that amount
[00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:13.660]   of money. So, you have your $550,000. You have half a million dollars sitting in cash.
[00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:18.740]   Now we're talking opportunity cost. So, you could invest in those bonds, and the income
[00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:21.820]   would pay you. I mean, you could tell your friends that at dinner. I don't know how many
[00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:24.780]   people are going to be really excited about a bond, but, "Hey, I bought this thing that's
[00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:28.980]   paying for my mortgage." Isn't the simpler option, if you have the cash, just pay the
[00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:33.380]   mortgage off, if you really want your mortgage paid for? Right? Because then you're taking
[00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:37.820]   the payment away, and it's just simpler. It takes the middleman out. It takes a step
[00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:43.300]   out. The other thing is, what else could you do with that $550,000? Because you're paying
[00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:47.260]   for your three and a quarter percent mortgage. What if, instead, you invested in the stock
[00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.700]   market and earned seven or eight percent? We're talking about leaving three to four
[00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:53.220]   percent on the table, right? Three percent per year, over 30 years, the life of this
[00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:57.620]   loan is, I don't know, on a half a million dollars, it's like three million bucks. Right?
[00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:00.900]   You earn an extra three percent in the stock market. That's like three million bucks you're
[00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:04.260]   leaving on the table. So, obviously, you can reinvest the money that you're not paying
[00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:07.500]   for your mortgage right now, and maybe you don't care about opportunity cost, but in
[00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:11.900]   that case, if you have the cash, just pay the mortgage off. Don't buy the bond to then
[00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:18.060]   pay yourself back for the mortgage. I think, as always, less is more in these things. So,
[00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:21.180]   I think the question is, if you have that much money, and not everyone has a half a
[00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:25.100]   million dollars just sitting around to buy their own mortgage or buy a bond that pays
[00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:30.060]   for it, just pay the loan off or invest that money in something else that can earn a higher
[00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:35.860]   return. Yeah. I feel like if this question was a film director, it'd be Christopher Nolan.
[00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:40.620]   This feels a lot like an Inception type thing or something.
[00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:44.020]   It's interesting because I think a lot of people, the movements we've seen in interest
[00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:48.780]   rates have been so fast and so big that people go, "Wow." I think just count yourself lucky
[00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:53.180]   you have that low interest rate and do everything you can to hang on to it. And so, maybe don't
[00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:57.420]   pay it off at all and invest in something else because that low rate is being eaten
[00:15:57.420 --> 00:16:06.060]   up by inflation. It's a great asset to have. And I would just -- yeah. Don't overthink
[00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:09.460]   it. Yeah. Good advice. Let's do another one.
[00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:14.620]   Okay. Up next, we have a question from Adam. "Can we start a movement to set the Fed funds
[00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:20.300]   rate using a blockchain smart contract? Unemployment rate, inflation data, housing data, retail
[00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:25.280]   sales, and industrial production ought to be enough to set up an algorithm that at least
[00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:29.260]   does halfway reasonable things all the time. The idea that we can cut rates to zero, then
[00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:33.500]   leave them there unnecessarily long, then raise them too quickly, and then too high
[00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:37.580]   is just crazy." All right. They have a point.
[00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:42.060]   The Fed is not very popular right now. The question is like -- I went on a little rant
[00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:44.820]   on the Fed this week on Animal Spirits. The question is, why was the Fed created in the
[00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:50.140]   first place? All right. From 1853 to 1933, the United States experienced a recession
[00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:55.180]   or depression once every 3.9 years. The average contraction in GDP during that time was 23%.
[00:16:55.180 --> 00:17:00.780]   It was -- I mean, we were essentially an emerging market back then, but that's why the Fed was
[00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:04.580]   -- one of the reasons the Fed was established in 1913 was to be the lender of last resorts.
[00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:08.300]   Because we kept having all these bank runs. And it was actually the panic of 1907, which
[00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:14.300]   -- I got some visuals. Pretty good book on it here, of the same name. This is when J.P.
[00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:18.900]   Morgan had to step in and essentially personally guarantee the banking system and kind of stop
[00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:23.420]   it. And then, in 1913, they finally set up the Fed to help -- and essentially, the Fed
[00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:25.580]   is the lender of last resort.
[00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:29.740]   Now, I'm guessing an algorithmic Fed on the blockchain is probably not going to fly these
[00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:34.020]   days. But a lot of people think a rules-based framework with the Fed would make more sense.
[00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:38.420]   Like you said, some sort of rolling average of the unemployment rate or some other economic
[00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:42.140]   data. I mean, John, throw the chart on. Just look at how closely the Fed funds rate follows
[00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:47.320]   the two-year Treasury yield over time. Now, you could say, well, the two-year is getting
[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:50.740]   its marching orders from the Fed funds rate. But you can see, actually, the two-year starts
[00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:53.860]   rolling over a lot of times before the Fed funds rate, and maybe they're just kind of
[00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:58.180]   predicting what the Fed's going to do. But market interest rates have done a pretty good
[00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:01.780]   job predicting what the Fed is going to do with short-term rates. And you can see right
[00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:05.900]   now, the short-term rates are, in the two years, much higher than the Fed's rate, assuming
[00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:09.060]   that -- that assumes the Fed funds rate is going to keep coming up.
[00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:15.640]   But even if a rules-based framework like this worked 95% of the time, it's probably that
[00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:19.940]   other 5% of the time that you want a governing body like this, and that's in a crisis. So,
[00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:26.260]   I think, as bad as I think the Fed has done recently trying to snap the economy's neck,
[00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:29.620]   I think they did an admirable job of keeping the financial system afloat during the pandemic.
[00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:34.820]   That easily could have been, the credit systems completely blew up and blew apart, the innerworkings
[00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:38.580]   and the piping of the financial system could have easily gone under, and we could have
[00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:42.480]   had a Great Depression because of the pandemic, when the government was still trying to figure
[00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:46.540]   out how to send out checks and give people money. I think the Fed stepping in there was
[00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:51.020]   big. So, I think you have to have them in those kind of times, where, again, they are
[00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:53.260]   the lender of last resort, when no one will step in.
[00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:56.020]   That happened with the Bank of England this week. It looked like a bunch of their pension
[00:18:56.020 --> 00:19:00.260]   funds were going to blow up. And because interest rates have been rising, and because of the
[00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:03.780]   way that these pension funds are set up, do you really want mom and pop to have their
[00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:09.300]   pension blow up because there's inflation? No. So, the Bank of England stepped in, and
[00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:13.580]   they put a stop to it. That's what you want them for. Some people say, "Well, moral hazard."
[00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:16.380]   Well, guess what? That's what they're there for. They're the lender of last resort. They
[00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:20.060]   don't want a disorderly thing to fall apart, just so some hedge fund manager can say he
[00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:25.780]   bought bonds for pennies in the dollar, or whatever. So, you could quibble with how the
[00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:29.860]   Fed handles the other 95% of the time. But I think for the 5% of the time that really
[00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:35.340]   needed in a crisis, that's probably why they're here. Anyway. So, unless you want to go back
[00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:39.380]   to a system where we have a depression or a panic every three years, the Fed is probably
[00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:44.540]   better than a blockchain contract. Because the original blockchain contract was the gold
[00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:49.220]   as a global reserve currency. We had to back up dollars with the gold. And that's part
[00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:52.260]   of the reason that we got this, because it was such a hard line, and the rules were too
[00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:56.460]   hard to fast. Yeah. And it should have been palladium, right? That would have made more
[00:19:56.460 --> 00:20:00.420]   sense. I don't really know my Fed history. Is there a Fed chair that is looked back at
[00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:05.780]   as being someone beloved in general? Or do they always end up making people mad? Well,
[00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:09.820]   the funny thing is, it's different. Alan Greenspan was beloved at the time, and now he's kind
[00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:14.660]   of hated, because everything he does is blue bubbles. And then Paul Volcker was absolutely
[00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:18.380]   hated in the late '70s and early '80s for jacking up interest rates, and now he's loved.
[00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:24.420]   So it kind of depends on when you're talking about. If he throws us into a recession, Jerome
[00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:28.340]   Powell is definitely going to be hated, I think. People are going to hate him for missing
[00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:32.580]   inflation and sending us into a recession. So he's not going to be the most loved guy
[00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:39.580]   there is. Got it. All right. Let's do another one. Next question. Okay. Tyler writes, "I'm
[00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:44.220]   35 and work for the government. I'll be able to retire at the age of 55 in 20 years, and
[00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:49.740]   my pension should pay me $80,000 to $100,000 a year. I'm still able to invest in a 457(b)
[00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:55.580]   and max it out, as well as my Roth IRA. Does it make sense to go all Roth for the 457(b),
[00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:59.540]   since my pension will be taxed as normal income when in retirement, since my pension money
[00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:02.540]   will act as fixed income bonds?"
[00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:05.500]   So this is actually our second question with someone who has a pension, which is very rare.
[00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:10.060]   I think from my research I found from my retirement book, in the 1960s, like 60% of workers had
[00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:13.500]   pension that covered at least part of their income, and today it's like 17% and falling
[00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:18.900]   fast. So we put out the bat signal here because there's a word "Roth" in here. So let's bring
[00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:21.500]   in our favorite tax guy, Bill Sweet.
[00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:22.940]   Bill Sweet.
[00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:25.180]   William Roth, my dad.
[00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:32.100]   All right. So the idea is they know they're going to have some income coming in, and they're
[00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:36.460]   trying to figure out asset location here, and maybe asset allocation. How does pension
[00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:41.060]   income impact tax planning here? And does that actually make it more sense for going
[00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:44.740]   all Roth? By the way, 457, was I right on that? Is that a nonprofit thing or is that
[00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:45.740]   a government thing?
[00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:50.700]   Yeah, it's a government. In some states, agencies use them. Different than a 457(f). If you're
[00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:56.140]   not in the comment section, there's some hot traffic going on about 457(f)s. Can we just
[00:21:56.140 --> 00:22:00.420]   skip back, though? Can we go back to question three? Is really the solution to today's problems
[00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:07.100]   an algorithmic stable fed? Because that's never gone wrong. Look at Google, Tara, and
[00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:08.100]   Luna.
[00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:12.820]   But let's get back to Tyler. People are always asking me if I know Tyler Durden. Duncan,
[00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:17.780]   are you a Fight Club guy on the Fincher rankings where you were Zodiac, Gone Girl?
[00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:21.900]   Yeah. I mean, no, it's good. I'm not crazy about it like a lot of people, but it's a
[00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:22.900]   good movie.
[00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:27.420]   I pictured you to be a mankhead. But no, great question, and congrats, Tyler. I think the
[00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:32.820]   interesting portfolio question is, would you treat a government pension as a bond? Because
[00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:37.180]   more or less, it's a very high amount of fixed income that's coming in monthly. But super
[00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:43.140]   duper interesting question, and a really great place to be. If you can max out a 457(f),
[00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:48.700]   that means you have the potential to save $20,000 a year, which is fantastic. So ultimately,
[00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:53.580]   457(f)s work a lot like 401(k)s. The concept there is the same. And the questioner, Tyler,
[00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:58.140]   is thinking about, do I take this pre-tax, save the tax money now, or do I eat it as
[00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:02.820]   a Roth, take the tax now, and then I get tax-free distributions in retirement?
[00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:08.860]   So just some quick setting the stage. Let's just say Tyler's earning about $120,000, assuming
[00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:14.540]   this is all checks out. So he's probably at a 24% tax rate today, let's say 6% for a state.
[00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:19.660]   In the future, this is a great place to be, $100,000 pension, right? Plus $30,000, let's
[00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:24.460]   say, Social Security, plus, let's say, $15,000 are RMDs. He's going to have about $145,000,
[00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:29.240]   $150,000 of future income. That's just obviously fantastic. And Tyler's made some good decisions
[00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:31.020]   to get there where he is in life.
[00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:36.060]   So ultimately, my diagnosis, though, is his current tax rate is probably going to be identical
[00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:40.260]   to his future tax rate. There's probably some nuance there in the state level we can debate
[00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:44.420]   and discuss, but I think it depends on very much. So ultimately, it's just a question.
[00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:49.260]   Do I want to pay tax on $20,000 of income, $6,000 of tax? Do I want to pay that now,
[00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:54.360]   or do I want to pay it in retirement? And I think it's more of a moral question, like,
[00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:59.380]   do you want to have an account that is $500,000 30 years from now tax-free, or let's say,
[00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:04.340]   a $750,000 that you have to pay 100% of tax on? Without knowing everything, it's very
[00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:08.900]   hard to say, but I'm a big Roth guy. William Roth, my dad, my father, that's where I'd
[00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:15.600]   go with this. And I think a Roth IRA for somebody with 35, my bias is we're in low-tax nirvana.
[00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:19.140]   So that's the direction I'd go with this. But I think it's a toss-up. Ben, what would
[00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:24.480]   you prefer? Well, you always tell me, you made me switch my 401(k) to a Roth, so I'm
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:29.920]   going to defer to you here. Yeah, do yourself a favor. And your kind of thing that you set
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:33.440]   up to me was, at my stage in life, I'm in my early 40s now, you said, you're getting
[00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:37.180]   to that point where you're going to reach up to higher levels of income. A Roth makes
[00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:41.140]   way more sense. And I guess, I think about it too, if you can save the same amount on
[00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:44.820]   a Roth as a regular, it feels like you're saving more. That's it. That's it. Because
[00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:51.460]   ultimately, yeah, the after-tax value of that Roth is 30% higher, in my math for Mr. Tyler,
[00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:57.020]   than it is if it's pre-tax, right? So ultimately, he would have access to $6,000 extra of taxes
[00:24:57.020 --> 00:25:00.460]   that he wouldn't have paid. But ultimately, people usually don't take that into account,
[00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:05.460]   Ben, as you know. I think personal finance-wise, pay yourself first, pay the tax now, and ultimately,
[00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:09.220]   you can enjoy that tax-free benefit later. And will he be paying taxes on his pension
[00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:10.220]   in 20 years?
[00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:15.840]   Yeah, I mean, yes. Again, if you buy my argument, we're in low-tax nirvana, government spending
[00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:19.780]   a trillion dollars a year in excess of income. Ultimately, that'll get recaptured at some
[00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:23.740]   point, inflation or not. So ultimately, yeah, I would expect his pension's going to be taxed.
[00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:27.540]   Probably some nuance in the state, but I think it can be worked out. But I think at age 35,
[00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:28.820]   I'd still push into Roth now.
[00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:33.060]   Yeah, it seems like a good point in life. And as far as the thing about pension income
[00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:37.740]   as a bond, it certainly allows you to take more risk because your portfolio doesn't have
[00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:40.700]   to fulfill as much of your income. So that's the way I look at it. It's not necessarily
[00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:45.700]   bond. It is income, but it's almost like you have a job that you're not working at. So
[00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:48.780]   you have less income that has to come out of your portfolio. So does that-- for some
[00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:51.460]   people, that gives them the peace of mind where they can take more risk. Other people
[00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:55.080]   say, why would I have to take more risk if I had this income? So it depends on your risk
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:56.080]   tolerance, basically.
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:59.680]   Exactly. And this is the value of a financial planner. It's almost like we're in this business.
[00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:02.980]   We answer these questions for our clients every day and give them specific advice. But
[00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:05.620]   this is a great place for Tyler to be. Good luck to you.
[00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:07.980]   Yeah. Next question.
[00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:15.340]   OK. Up next, we have a question from Mike. Not to brag, but I'm a 64-year-old married
[00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:23.420]   retiree with $3.6 million of investments. I retired at age 59. No debt and a $60,000
[00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:29.660]   pension. We have been doing Roth conversions up to the top of the 24% bracket for the past
[00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:36.700]   four years, which usually results in about $180,000 Roth conversion per year. Currently,
[00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:44.780]   we have $1.15 million in IRA and $1.657 in a Roth. Plan is to continue conversions for
[00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:49.340]   at least the next five to six years. Goal is to have very little taxable income at 70-plus
[00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:55.300]   years of age. Roth conversion taxes calculated out to be about 1.4% of our investments. Can
[00:26:55.300 --> 00:27:00.500]   we withdraw around 5.5% to compensate for the Roth tax burden? I haven't attempted the
[00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:05.140]   math, but speculate we can safely take out more than 4% since future retirement accounts
[00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:08.000]   will essentially be all tax-free Roth.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.660]   Duncan, I think we need a not to brag t-shirt that we send to the person who does the best
[00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:12.660]   not to brag every week.
[00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:13.940]   Yeah, this is a pretty good one.
[00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:17.900]   I like this question. It's basically, how do taxes impact withdrawal rates? I've done
[00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:22.260]   the research on Bill Bengen's 4% rule. The guy has been dining on that his whole life.
[00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:25.260]   I'm sure he goes to every financial conference he goes to, the guy never pays for a drink.
[00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:26.260]   That's great.
[00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:27.260]   Right?
[00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:28.260]   Yeah.
[00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:31.100]   So I've never really seen any work with this in terms of taxes. So Bill, this can be your
[00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:34.700]   corner. You have to do the white paper on this and be the person, but I don't think
[00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:39.260]   I've seen any work on this. If you have the majority of your retirement assets that are
[00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:43.340]   tax-free coming out as a Roth, and you originally were going to go for the 4% rule because you
[00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:46.260]   were worried about paying some taxes too, could you take a higher percentage out because
[00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:47.740]   you're not paying those taxes?
[00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:52.420]   Yeah. This is a great problem to have for Mike, first off. But secondly, just thinking
[00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:58.180]   about it esoterically, the question I want to answer is, how much Roth is too much? Right?
[00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:01.260]   But I think to answer Mike's specific question, yeah. I mean, I wouldn't factor in the Roth
[00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:05.660]   conversion because you're not consuming those assets. Right? If you're converting assets
[00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:10.580]   from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA, that's really just future spending. You're just choosing
[00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:15.100]   to prepay your tax. Right? And if ultimately, if the only debit there is the 1 point whatever
[00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:18.500]   percent of living expenses that are going to pay the taxes, all you're doing is just
[00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:21.900]   accelerating the tax that you would be paying in the future. When you've got R&Ds, when
[00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:24.860]   you've got other stuff going on, maybe your pension is higher there, God willing, it's
[00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:28.700]   COLA adjusted, and compounding at 9% a year, that thing could double, right, in the next
[00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:32.320]   seven years, God willing. Or maybe not, because I don't want that inflationary environment.
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:36.860]   But moving back, ultimately, all he's doing is just prepaying tax. Right? And ultimately,
[00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:40.780]   he's just pushing that consumption out into the future. I think this is very valid, and
[00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:44.820]   I would think about it. But Ben, the question I want to look at is, if he's got 1 point
[00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:50.060]   6-- again, great for him-- $1.6 million in Roth and $1.1 million in IRA, is that too
[00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:53.420]   much? Is that too much of a balance for somebody at 64? What do you think?
[00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:58.180]   Right, so I guess you're saying the idea is, since he's paying the taxes now, his balance
[00:28:58.180 --> 00:29:01.100]   could be bigger in retirement if he didn't pay the taxes now, because he'd be saving
[00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:02.100]   that money and investing it.
[00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:06.140]   Yeah, but it depends on what game he's playing. Yeah, so I think my general theory-- and this
[00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:09.180]   is the problem that I think Roth solved-- is that people tend to optimize for their
[00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:13.500]   net worth. What I really think they should be optimizing for is after-tax spending. Right?
[00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:19.900]   And so if I'm 64, just actually, how much time do I have left? 20 years? And ultimately,
[00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:24.780]   I'm doing these Roth conversions. I think it's wise to do that up to 24%. But what for?
[00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:28.980]   Right? What am I doing this for? And ultimately, at some point, you would want to think about,
[00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:33.100]   am I doing this because I want to pass on these assets to my children tax-free? This
[00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:37.700]   is a great thing to do. If it's a charitable intent, I would stop Roth conversions now,
[00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:41.860]   because you can just give that IRA to charity and make the charitable a beneficiary, a
[00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:44.760]   university, a public library, or something like that. And they can get all that money
[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:48.220]   without you paying the tax. Right? So I think, ultimately, I would sit down and maybe think
[00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:53.180]   about, why am I doing this at this point? And I think somebody that's got 2/3 or, let's
[00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:58.060]   say, 55% of their assets in Roth, it almost strikes me as that's the limit. That's about
[00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:01.580]   as far as I would want to go. Right. They're almost like a 60/40. That seems like they've
[00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:05.220]   got plenty of cover, especially with the pension, too. Yep. Yep. Because ultimately, when you
[00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:10.300]   get to 72, you have RMDs start to kick in. You are going to have continued tax issues
[00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:14.500]   going forward. And ultimately, if you have that very large Roth bucket, what is the plan?
[00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:17.400]   What are you going to do with that? And I would start having some fun. After you sit
[00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:23.060]   down and knock it out your 10-page dissertation on how taxes impact withdrawal rates, we'll
[00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:26.940]   have the introduction here on Portfolio Risk. The good stuff. Again, Mike, you need a financial
[00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:30.100]   planner, my man. You need to sit down with somebody competent, maybe a CFP. Yeah. And
[00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:34.420]   he's in a great spot. But yeah, that's the time when you-- you're right. What's the point
[00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:36.700]   of doing this? Are you doing this just for the sake of doing it because it makes you
[00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:40.260]   feel better? Or is there actually a point to it? Yeah. And he's won the game. So I think
[00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:44.660]   when you win the game, you stop playing. Speaking of winning the game, we've got one more here.
[00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:50.320]   Yeah. Let us know in the chat who wins, but not to brag of the day. Also, someone in the
[00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:57.800]   chat said, I have a supermodel wife who wants a bigger home. What should I do? Not bad.
[00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:02.760]   Portfolio Rescue, where the salmon flock like the Capistrano and all the beer tastes like
[00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:08.960]   wine. And it's good stuff. OK. So up next, we have a question from Mark. I'm 43 and I've
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:14.440]   done pretty well. I have about $3 million in real estate with very little debt, $1.2
[00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:21.600]   million, which was $1.5 in equities, but only about $30,000 in a Roth IRA. At some point,
[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:27.540]   should I just even taxes and do a backdoor Roth? All right. Mark's doing pretty well
[00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:33.320]   here. Pretty well. The majority of his net worth is tied up in real estate. Does that
[00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:37.320]   tie into this at all? Does that matter at all? Or do you think if he's got the majority
[00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:42.160]   of this money in taxable accounts, he should just suck it up and do it at this point? Can
[00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:47.260]   I do a quick thing? These are great questions for big problems for millionaires, and I don't
[00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:50.680]   know what percentage of the Portfolio Rescue audience, but I think we need some questions
[00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:56.680]   from the people. I think we need to get populist with this. Here's the way that I think about
[00:31:56.680 --> 00:32:00.640]   it, though. I worked in the institutional world, and I was dealing with-- Is that where
[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:04.920]   you got that vest? Where did that come from? But I was working with portfolios that had
[00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:11.480]   8, 9, 10 figures. And the way I thought about it, after a certain point, is it's just an
[00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:15.720]   extra zero. These people are all dealing with the same problems. Same questions. In a lot
[00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:19.660]   of ways. Obviously, there's more comfort here when you have a seven-figure portfolio when
[00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:23.560]   you're in your 40s. But it's still the same questions and the same worries. The math is
[00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:30.280]   more fun when it's big numbers. It's true. Yeah. Let's just pretend Mark has $3,000 in
[00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:35.960]   real estate. OK. So yeah. A backdoor Roth isn't going to solve your problem, right?
[00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:40.360]   You can stick $6,000 into a backdoor Roth IRA. So I think he's asking a different question,
[00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:44.080]   actually, than what he said. I think he's saying, should I Roth convert? And the year
[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:47.480]   that I would Roth convert would maybe be a year-- I don't know-- US equities are down
[00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:50.920]   20%. And maybe our bonds have taken a hit, too. And maybe we're-- oh, I'm describing
[00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:55.360]   this exact scenario, right? Where we've had a punishing year, and ultimately, the cost
[00:32:55.360 --> 00:33:00.400]   of converting is going to be lower if we expect our future returns to be higher. So yes. Without
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:04.400]   knowing Mark's full situation, again, I would urge him to hire a financial planner to help
[00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:10.320]   answer this. But yeah. He's probably got a 40-year runway on life, maybe 45 years. Ultimately,
[00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:14.160]   this is a great time to think about it, because we've been punishing-- unless he's been in
[00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:18.800]   cash this whole year, he's probably down 20%, 30% in his equities. And ultimately, this
[00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:22.640]   is a great year to consider it, because the taxes are going to be low today on any amounts
[00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:27.440]   he chooses to convert. Let's go back to question 3. The questioner was thinking, OK, I'm going
[00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:31.640]   to fill up my 24% bracket. I think that's the thing to think about, Mark. If you count
[00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:34.400]   in all your income this year, where are you going to be in the tax code? Where does it
[00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:38.880]   make sense? And that's the starting point that I'd look at. And you've got about three
[00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:42.280]   weeks, three months to figure it out between now and the end of the year. But I think you've
[00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:48.160]   got a golden opportunity in 2022. All right. Roth wins again. Someone asked if this is
[00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:52.640]   actually an official Federal Reserve vest. And it's not, because if it was a Fed vest,
[00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:55.280]   I would have already lost my shirt, and I'd be wearing just the vest, because the Fed
[00:33:55.280 --> 00:34:00.020]   has made everyone lose money this year. Yeah. It's puffy, but it's not inflated. The inflation
[00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:04.680]   is not very high. All right. One more announcement here. This was sent to us yesterday. I've
[00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:09.440]   been pounding the table on this all year. U.S. Senator Deb Fischer, introduced yesterday
[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:14.840]   with Senator Mark Warner, raising the annual IBON purchase limit for individuals to $30,000
[00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:19.760]   when inflation is over 3.5%. Now, I got an email from someone in one of the offices of
[00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:24.540]   these senators. And they said, like you've said over and over in many of your now classic
[00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:28.120]   rants to Michael and Duncan about IBONs, the Treasury Department's lack of action raising
[00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:31.460]   the arbitrary limit. We doubled the limit for individuals to $30,000, returning the
[00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:34.920]   purchase limit to where it was originally when IBONs were first introduced in the Clinton
[00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:38.480]   administration, which I didn't realize. Business and trust accounts would not be eligible for
[00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:43.000]   the increased cap. We keep the focus on inflation relief for families and individuals. I'm not
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:50.120]   saying I helped craft bills in the Senate, but I'm not not saying that. I pounded the
[00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:54.280]   table, and we got it done. Sean Patrick Maloney, Chuck Schumer, I hope you're listening. We
[00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:58.840]   did it. Carlson 2024. We need confetti. We did it. This hasn't gone through yet, but
[00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:02.600]   it sounds like we're going to get $30,000. And I love the rule. Someone asked if we could
[00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:08.080]   have an algorithmic Fed. We have an algorithmic IBONs. When inflation is high, you increase.
[00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:12.520]   I think that's great. Ease the pain of the people. Although, backstage we were talking,
[00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:16.760]   ironically, this could potentially increase inflation by getting more money out there
[00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:21.360]   into the economy, which is interesting. Hey, let's just take a win while we have it. Hey,
[00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:24.800]   this actually increases savings, though, Bill. It's less spending. Yeah, that's true. That's
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:30.320]   true. I hope this goes through. It sounds great. All right. Thanks again to Bill, as
