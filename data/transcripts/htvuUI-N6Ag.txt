[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:11.920]   - Welcome to Bogle Heads on Investing,
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.000]   podcast number 19.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.840]   Today, my special guest is Dr. Jim Dawley,
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.080]   the White Coat Investor.
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.560]   Jim is an author, entrepreneur, blogger,
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.160]   speaker, dad, and full-time physician.
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.220]   He's a busy guy.
[00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.920]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.900]   My name is Rick Ferry,
[00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.020]   and I'm the host of Bogle Heads on Investing.
[00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.860]   This podcast, as with all podcasts,
[00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.220]   are sponsored by the John C. Bogle
[00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:52.220]   Center for Financial Literacy, a 501(c)(3) corporation.
[00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.900]   Each month, we have a special guest.
[00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.580]   This month, we have Dr. Jim Dawley,
[00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.140]   the White Coat Investor.
[00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.020]   I've known Jim for many years
[00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.340]   and watched him grow from a few small posts
[00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.140]   on the Bogle Heads forum
[00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.180]   up to a multi-million dollar enterprise.
[00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.180]   He's done a fantastic job.
[00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.900]   He's written a couple of books.
[00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.940]   He's running conferences,
[00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:16.780]   and he's still working
[00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.400]   as a full-time emergency room physician.
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:25.260]   With no further ado, let me introduce Dr. Jim Dawley.
[00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:26.760]   Welcome, doctor.
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.300]   - Thank you, and please don't call me doc.
[00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.380]   Just call me Jim.
[00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:30.580]   - Okay.
[00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.980]   You and I have known each other for quite some time.
[00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.420]   If I recall, we first met face-to-face
[00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.140]   at a Bogle Heads meeting,
[00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.020]   and I think it might've been San Diego.
[00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.700]   Do you recall that?
[00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.460]   - It was probably in Texas.
[00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:47.300]   - Oh, Texas.
[00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.300]   - I'll bet it was Fort Worth in 2008,
[00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.700]   'cause that was the first one I went to.
[00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.820]   - And you were just a couple of years out of residency.
[00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.300]   In fact, you were still in the military
[00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.260]   at that time, if I recall.
[00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.080]   - Yes, I was.
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.920]   I was still in the Air Force.
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.160]   I was right in the middle of my service there,
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.540]   my four years of active duty.
[00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:05.940]   I think I had recently returned
[00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.060]   from a deployment to the Middle East.
[00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.140]   - How did you go from college to medical school
[00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.940]   to the military, and then what happened after that?
[00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.300]   Give us the whole picture.
[00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.140]   - Sure.
[00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.700]   I grew up in Alaska, a middle-class family.
[00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.940]   My father was an engineer.
[00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.640]   My mother stayed at home, had five siblings,
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.540]   and we were never going hungry,
[00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.580]   but we certainly didn't have a lot of wealth.
[00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.700]   But again, it wasn't a hand-to-mouth existence by any means.
[00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.420]   Went away to college knowing that my parents
[00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.940]   would not be able to support me in college.
[00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.940]   I knew I was paying for it on my own.
[00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.900]   And so I went from Alaska, where I grew up,
[00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.420]   to Utah, where I went to Brigham Young University.
[00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.980]   And my interest at that time was all science.
[00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.780]   My major was molecular biology.
[00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.740]   Almost all the classes I took were science.
[00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.820]   I took nothing in finance or business.
[00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.100]   Graduated and, of course, got into medical school
[00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.580]   at the University of Utah.
[00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.100]   Spent the next four years there.
[00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.620]   I got married between college and medical school,
[00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.220]   and we had no kids while I was in medical school.
[00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.220]   My wife got a master's degree during those years,
[00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.900]   worked in a physical therapy clinic,
[00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.020]   also taught some ski lessons.
[00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.140]   And then I matched into an emergency medicine residency
[00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.700]   at the University of Arizona, down in Tucson.
[00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.580]   And so we moved down there
[00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.000]   for a three-year emergency medicine residency.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.260]   From that point, I had a military commitment.
[00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.060]   The military paid for my medical school.
[00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.040]   So instead of money loans, I had time loans.
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.460]   I owed them four years of active duty.
[00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.820]   And the Air Force stationed me in Virginia,
[00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.220]   Langley Air Force Base.
[00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.800]   The Air Force needed me there for a team
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.820]   that they deployed from time to time.
[00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.740]   And so I deployed to the Middle East,
[00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.660]   spent about five months in Qatar, or Qatar,
[00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.080]   depending on how you wanna pronounce that.
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.300]   And then had a shorter deployment to Chile.
[00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:56.680]   So I really kind of lucked out.
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.580]   A lot of people during my time period,
[00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.780]   from 2006 to 2010, when I was on active duty,
[00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.380]   were getting deployed for six out of every 20 months
[00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.020]   in the Air Force, for nine months at a time in the Navy,
[00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.540]   for 15 months at a time in the Army.
[00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.380]   And I really only spent about six months total
[00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:13.700]   deployed out of four years.
[00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.660]   So I kind of got lucky that way with the deployments.
[00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.420]   And then at that point,
[00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.840]   I decided we wanted to go live someplace with mountains.
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.160]   One of the things that bothered me the most
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.520]   being in the military was they tell you
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.400]   where you're gonna live.
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.920]   And it turned out I did not like living in Virginia
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.360]   very much with no mountains.
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.400]   So I started looking for a job in places with mountains.
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.080]   I looked at Anchorage and Portland and Reno and Boise
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.720]   and Salt Lake and Denver,
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.560]   and ended up with a job in Salt Lake.
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.320]   And I've been here ever since.
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.280]   - I have to say that if anybody from Virginia is listening,
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.880]   I disagree with Jim.
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.880]   There are mountains in Virginia,
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.040]   but you gotta go very far west to see them.
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.600]   - Yes, there definitely are mountains out there,
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.680]   but it's hard after living in places like Utah and Alaska
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.240]   to see them as the same type of mountains, for sure.
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.560]   - Fair enough.
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.560]   - You know, about halfway through residency,
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.760]   I kind of got sick of feeling ripped off.
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.200]   At that point, I realized I'd been ripped off
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.200]   by an insurance agent, by a financial advisor,
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.000]   by a recruiter, by a lender, a couple of times,
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.120]   by a realtor.
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.120]   And I just realized if I didn't start learning
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.440]   some of this financial stuff,
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.800]   this was just gonna be a pattern throughout my whole life.
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.560]   And it was getting old.
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.080]   So I decided I would go across the street
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.800]   from where we were living to a used bookstore,
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.360]   and I started reading books.
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.080]   And I read a lot of terrible financial books,
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.760]   but I found a few gems.
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.560]   And I realized that the good books
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.200]   were all saying the same thing.
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.720]   And so I moved my money away from the commission
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.080]   to financial advisor I had, to Vanguard,
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.380]   and started investing in index funds at Vanguard,
[00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.560]   like the good books all tell you to do,
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.520]   and then stumbled a few months later
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.400]   on the Vanguard Diehards Forum at Morningstar.
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.640]   - You first found out about the Bogleheads
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:56.960]   through Morningstar,
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.800]   but then the forum shifted off of Morningstar,
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.360]   and it went to its own website at bogleheads.org.
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.000]   - I can remember the post that got me to sign up.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.680]   And back at that time, people might not know this,
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.840]   you had to pay money to use the forum.
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.600]   You had to pay $5 to join the forum.
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:21.100]   And the post that convinced me to pay my $5
[00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.040]   and become a Boglehead, make my first post,
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:28.440]   was called something like you might be a Boglehead if.
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:31.800]   And over the course of several years,
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.080]   some while I was in residency,
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.680]   not as much, obviously, because I was busy,
[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.800]   but particularly while I was in the military,
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.120]   I made a lot of posts on the Bogleheads Forum.
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.800]   At one point, I think I was the eighth
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.560]   most prolific poster there.
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.640]   You know, in the beginning,
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:44.840]   I think like most people that come there,
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.780]   I was asking questions and getting answers
[00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:50.280]   and learning things and making tweaks to my portfolio
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:53.760]   and making improvements in my tax situation.
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:54.800]   I was learning.
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.000]   But as the years went by,
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.880]   I realized I was doing a lot more teaching than learning.
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.200]   And every time I'd find a doc,
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.320]   I was like, man, they got the same questions
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.280]   as the last doc.
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:05.920]   Same questions, same situations,
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.740]   over and over and over again.
[00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:10.340]   And that wasn't the only financial forum I was on.
[00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:12.400]   I was on a student doctor network forum
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.920]   and a forum called Surmo.
[00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.320]   And it was kind of the same story there.
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:17.880]   And I got sick of typing the same things
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.680]   over and over again into the internet.
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.480]   And so I decided, well, I'll just start a blog.
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:25.120]   And then every time I see these same 50 questions
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.820]   that every doctor has come up,
[00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:28.840]   I'm just gonna post a link to the blog post
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.040]   that answers the question.
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:31.240]   They'll get a lot better answer,
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:32.520]   and I don't have to type the same thing in
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:33.520]   over and over again.
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.160]   And that was a major motivation
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:38.000]   behind me starting the White Coat Investor back in 2011.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.640]   - But you've done pretty well financially as well.
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:43.000]   - I said, well, I'm spending an awful lot of time online
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.560]   to not be making any money doing it.
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.680]   So let's start this thing as a business
[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:49.160]   and see if we can actually make some money.
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:52.720]   Unfortunately, the problem is you can't post links
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.880]   to a for-profit business,
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.360]   or at least you're not supposed to,
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:57.560]   on the Bogleheads forum.
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.680]   And so one of the main points
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.320]   for me starting the stupid thing,
[00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:02.600]   to be able to not type the same thing
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:04.540]   into the internet over and over again,
[00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:06.600]   became outlawed within a year or so
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.880]   of me starting the website and putting ads up on it.
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.720]   And so, unfortunately, that was the case.
[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.320]   - And it still is, by the way.
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:15.080]   - Yeah, still is, for sure, yeah.
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:17.520]   In fact, I've had a few interactions
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.720]   with Boglehead regulars and moderators over the years,
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.480]   and we've gotten very explicit
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:25.360]   as far as what is allowed and what is not allowed.
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:27.000]   And occasionally, I've stepped over the line.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.920]   I think I even had a short banning.
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.720]   I think I had a two-week ban at one point
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.420]   for something I said.
[00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:34.260]   I can't remember what it was.
[00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.440]   It was just barely over the line.
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:37.280]   And so whatever.
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.560]   You know, moderation's good.
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:42.000]   Without moderation, you end up with a forum
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.960]   that reads like underneath every single article on CNN.
[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.920]   - I've been banned, so don't feel bad.
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:50.000]   - Yeah.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.160]   - I think I was banned for about a month or something.
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.480]   I'd said something or did something and upset somebody,
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:56.320]   and I got banned too.
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:57.640]   So, I mean, if you haven't been banned,
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:59.320]   then you're really not trying.
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:00.800]   - For sure.
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:01.640]   - All right.
[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:04.800]   Well, so this whole website that you created,
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:07.840]   eventually, you decided to write a book.
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:09.920]   I recall sitting down with you in Dallas
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:11.920]   and talking with you about the book.
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:14.960]   I think you were getting ready to write it at the time.
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.560]   - Well, it was interesting.
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:19.740]   I have to give Mike Piper, the oblivious investor,
[00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:21.240]   some credit for this book.
[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.840]   You know, one of the things about the website
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:25.520]   when I started, obviously, there was almost nobody else
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:27.760]   doing anything similar, and certainly nobody doing it
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:30.980]   as much as I was and promoting as much as I was
[00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:31.820]   on the website.
[00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:35.920]   And it was growing rapidly in 2011, 2012, 2013.
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.560]   Doctors were going, "Wow, here it is.
[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:39.160]   "This is what I've been looking for."
[00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:40.880]   But what I didn't really know
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.840]   was how to run an online business.
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:44.520]   I really wasn't very good at it.
[00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:46.840]   And in fact, I told myself if I can't figure out a way
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:50.320]   to make $1,000 a month from this thing within two years,
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:52.360]   I'm gonna drop it and I'm gonna go do something else,
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:55.240]   you know, real estate side gig or something like that.
[00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.220]   And I just barely made that goal.
[00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:00.200]   At two years, I was making about $1,000 a month.
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.420]   And so I decided, well, I better take this more seriously.
[00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:04.620]   I better figure out this online business stuff.
[00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:07.500]   And I decided to go to a conference called FinCon.
[00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:09.780]   And at that conference, one of the sections
[00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:11.800]   was a panel on how to write a book.
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:14.280]   Mike Piper was one of the people on the panel.
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:18.140]   And as you know, his entire business is selling his books.
[00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:20.940]   And so at that point, he had self-published several books
[00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:23.660]   and was essentially an expert in the process.
[00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:26.060]   And so I realized, you know what?
[00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:27.380]   What my readers have been telling me
[00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:30.700]   that I should write a book for years is absolutely right.
[00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:31.620]   I should go write it.
[00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:35.200]   And so a week or two later, I was driving to Denver
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.140]   with my wife, we were going out there for a wedding.
[00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:39.700]   And I wrote most of "The White Coat Investor,
[00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:42.400]   "A Doctor's Guide to Personal Finance and Investing"
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:43.500]   in route to Denver.
[00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:45.340]   She drove and I typed.
[00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:48.240]   And certainly the skeleton, if not the vast majority
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:50.300]   of the chapters in the book were written on that drive
[00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:52.140]   between Salt Lake and Denver.
[00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:54.000]   It then took three or four months to figure out
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.880]   all the other parts to writing and publishing a book.
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:59.820]   You know, Amazon makes it relatively easy to publish a book.
[00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:02.120]   If you want the book to be really pretty,
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.420]   it's not nearly as good of a place to go.
[00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:06.940]   But if you actually want to make significant money
[00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:09.660]   off a book, because the publisher,
[00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:11.860]   when you publish a book in the traditional way,
[00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:14.180]   keeps a big chunk of what the book makes.
[00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:16.820]   If you actually want to keep the big chunk yourself,
[00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:18.660]   self-publishing is definitely the way to go.
[00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:21.620]   The problem is you also have to be the self-marketer.
[00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:22.620]   So if you're not gonna get out there
[00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:26.140]   and market your own book, it's not a great route to go.
[00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:28.100]   But certainly the book has been well-received.
[00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:29.960]   It's interesting, when you publish a book,
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:33.360]   you are instantly looked at as an authority.
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.980]   And so it led to lots of other invitations
[00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:39.300]   to write for other publications, to speak, et cetera.
[00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:41.580]   And it's been a fun journey to see a lot of people
[00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:43.940]   that wouldn't read a blog or wouldn't listen to a podcast,
[00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:45.700]   but will read a book, pick it up,
[00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:48.260]   and really get the message.
[00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.500]   - You know, I've written several books.
[00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:53.500]   The first one I wrote, I self-published.
[00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:56.180]   And I didn't have a very good luck
[00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:59.820]   because immediately after I self-published the book,
[00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:01.620]   and I had ordered like 3,000 books,
[00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:03.460]   I put it with a distributor, and within a month,
[00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:05.860]   the distributor went into chapter 11, chapter seven.
[00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:06.700]   - Oh, geez.
[00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:10.180]   - Yeah, so this truck backs up to my driveway
[00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:11.620]   and dumps off 3,000 books,
[00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:13.420]   which I had loaded in my basement.
[00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:16.860]   Nobody knew who I was, and those books sat in my basement
[00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:19.060]   for probably three or four years
[00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:22.380]   before I finally got them distributed.
[00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:25.140]   - If you wanna actually make money on a book,
[00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:27.460]   self-publishing it is the way to go.
[00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:30.740]   However, you need a platform by which to promote it.
[00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:31.700]   - Absolutely.
[00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:34.860]   - You know, you had the platform, so you went that route,
[00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:39.300]   and that then also drew in more readers.
[00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:42.380]   You ended up doing a second book.
[00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:43.220]   - That's right.
[00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:45.860]   I just published a second book about a year ago.
[00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:48.740]   This one grew out of an email course.
[00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:51.020]   I found a lot of people were coming to my blog
[00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:52.100]   and they were lost, right?
[00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:54.260]   At that point, they had years and years of blog posts
[00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.420]   and couldn't tell what was most important,
[00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:57.980]   what was not as important.
[00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:00.580]   They had no framework to place the information into.
[00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:02.580]   And so I put together an email course.
[00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:03.980]   When you signed up for my newsletter,
[00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:07.180]   my monthly newsletter, you got a series of 12 emails.
[00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:09.460]   You'd get one a week for 12 weeks,
[00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:11.700]   and each one would come with a task.
[00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:12.740]   For example, the first one was,
[00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:15.180]   "Go get yourself some disability insurance."
[00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:18.100]   And so that was the framework for the second book.
[00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:19.420]   The second book, each chapter
[00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:21.980]   was one of those emails, essentially.
[00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:23.740]   It turned out not to be quite as easy
[00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:25.740]   to convert them from emails to book chapters
[00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:28.180]   as I originally thought it would be,
[00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:30.620]   but basically fluffed up each of those book chapters,
[00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:32.540]   added some anecdotes from readers,
[00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:36.820]   and turned those emails into the second book, essentially,
[00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:39.580]   which is kind of a step-by-step, nuts and bolts,
[00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:42.140]   "Here's what you need to do to take care of business."
[00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:43.260]   Whereas I think the first book
[00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.380]   was a little bit more inspiration
[00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:48.220]   and less nuts and bolts compared to the second one.
[00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:49.420]   - So the title of the first book
[00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:51.500]   was "The White Coat Investor,"
[00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:52.940]   and the title of the second book
[00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:56.020]   was called "Financial Boot Camp,"
[00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:57.460]   with a foreword by Jonathan Clements,
[00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:59.060]   who I had on as a guest also.
[00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:01.100]   By the way, also had Mike Piper on as a guest,
[00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:03.220]   so you're hitting all of the right people.
[00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:04.340]   In "Financial Boot Camp,"
[00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:06.740]   you talk about the 12-step approach
[00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:08.860]   to bring your finances up to speed.
[00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:12.700]   And I do give you a lot of credit right at the beginning.
[00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:16.140]   The very first thing that you put in chapter one
[00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:17.940]   is disability insurance,
[00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:19.940]   and then chapter two is life insurance.
[00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:22.140]   And a lot of people that I speak with,
[00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:25.580]   they have that as like number 11, 12,
[00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:27.980]   or maybe not even on the list.
[00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:30.140]   And I give you a lot of credit
[00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:31.980]   for putting that number one and two.
[00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:34.420]   - Yeah, I think it's important
[00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:37.860]   because you always run into doctors that get disabled
[00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:39.540]   or even die during residency
[00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:41.460]   before they even get started investing.
[00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:45.500]   And until you're kind of in a position to do so,
[00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:48.220]   you have no business whatsoever
[00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:50.540]   paying a bunch of attention to your asset allocation.
[00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:52.820]   You got to take care of the basics first.
[00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:54.820]   - And a lot of people don't know
[00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:57.580]   how much disability insurance they should have.
[00:14:57.580 --> 00:14:59.180]   Do you have some sort of rule of thumb?
[00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:00.900]   What do you suggest?
[00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:02.340]   - Well, I think the first thing you need to know
[00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:04.060]   is how much you're spending,
[00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:06.580]   'cause certainly your disability insurance benefit
[00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:08.220]   has to cover that at least
[00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:10.660]   in order for you to keep the same lifestyle
[00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:12.220]   if you become disabled.
[00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:13.540]   But what a lot of people don't realize
[00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:18.260]   is disability insurance only pays until you're 65 or 67.
[00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:19.300]   And so after that point,
[00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:21.060]   if you don't have anything saved up for retirement,
[00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:23.420]   you're gonna be all on social security.
[00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:24.860]   And so I tell people
[00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:26.060]   that you need to have enough
[00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:27.500]   of a disability insurance benefit
[00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:29.700]   to not only maintain your lifestyle,
[00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:32.580]   but also enough to save for retirement.
[00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:33.700]   The nice thing about it is
[00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:35.220]   because you generally are paying
[00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:37.780]   for at least individual disability insurance policies
[00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:39.420]   with post-tax dollars,
[00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:41.620]   the benefit is also post-tax.
[00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:43.180]   And so you don't need to have enough
[00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:45.940]   to cover your entire gross income by any means,
[00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:48.260]   but you need enough to cover what you're spending
[00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:51.820]   and enough additionally to save for retirement
[00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:53.060]   and meet your goals.
[00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:54.420]   So for a typical physician,
[00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:57.380]   I would suspect most of them have a monthly benefit
[00:15:57.380 --> 00:16:00.860]   of something like 10 to $15,000 a month.
[00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:04.100]   - And life insurance is somewhat the same calculation,
[00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:07.860]   correct, to determine how much a physician would need
[00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:08.900]   in life insurance.
[00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:11.340]   If it's a family and it's a husband and wife,
[00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:13.300]   just one of them is a physician,
[00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:15.620]   do you have a recommended amount of life insurance
[00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:18.020]   if they're sort of the breadwinner of the family?
[00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:19.260]   - Yeah, in that sort of a situation,
[00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:20.500]   you need a lot of life insurance.
[00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:22.300]   It's going to be a seven-figure amount,
[00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:24.980]   probably something between one and 5 million.
[00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:26.180]   Now it's gonna vary depending
[00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:28.860]   on what you want the life insurance to actually do.
[00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:30.820]   If you're the only breadwinner in the family
[00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:33.140]   and you want your family to have the exact same lifestyle
[00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:34.500]   with or without you,
[00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:36.660]   you need to have enough in there to pay off the mortgage,
[00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:37.820]   to pay for college,
[00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:41.580]   to create a nest egg at your death for your spouse
[00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:43.980]   to live the rest of their life, essentially.
[00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:46.180]   And so that's gonna be in the higher kind of numbers,
[00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:48.300]   three, four or 5 million kind of number.
[00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:49.500]   On the other hand,
[00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:51.860]   if your goal is to just provide enough for your spouse
[00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:53.340]   until the kids are out of the house,
[00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:56.020]   or give your spouse a few years to transition back
[00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:58.580]   into the workforce and maybe pay off the mortgage,
[00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:00.380]   you might have a little bit smaller amount.
[00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:02.180]   But I think there are very few attending physicians
[00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:04.380]   that should have less than a million dollars
[00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:07.620]   if they're the only breadwinner in the family.
[00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:09.020]   Now you run into some other situations
[00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:11.220]   where you got two docs married to each other
[00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:13.260]   and they might actually function
[00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.780]   as each other's life insurance in some ways.
[00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:18.260]   And so I think it's okay to have less insurance
[00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:20.700]   and maybe if you wanna roll the dice a little bit
[00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:22.460]   to not have insurance at all.
[00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:25.500]   But of course that doesn't insure against the possibility
[00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:28.460]   of both of you being wiped out at once if you have children.
[00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:31.220]   - One of the insurances that I talk a lot about
[00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:34.860]   with my clients is an umbrella policy.
[00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:36.860]   Once you start to accumulate wealth,
[00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:38.420]   especially if you start accumulating wealth
[00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:41.300]   outside of tax sheltered retirement plans
[00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:44.140]   or accumulating wealth outside of your home,
[00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:46.500]   it could be attached by creditors.
[00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:49.380]   What are you recommending for an umbrella policy?
[00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:50.220]   - You know, it's interesting.
[00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:52.740]   Everybody wants a formula for umbrella insurance,
[00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:55.740]   like some multiple of your net worth, for instance.
[00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:58.220]   And I don't think that's necessarily helpful.
[00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:00.620]   And the reason why is the amount you want
[00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:02.700]   is a little bit more than the biggest judgment
[00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:04.980]   that will ever be taken out against you during your life.
[00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:08.140]   And you simply have no idea what that is going to be
[00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:11.620]   until that incident occurs, if that occurs.
[00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:14.060]   And so I think the main thing you want to do
[00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:15.500]   is kind of the same approach
[00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:17.380]   you take to malpractice insurance.
[00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:20.100]   You want a big, big policy
[00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:22.540]   that will not only pay for a robust defense
[00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:23.660]   because the insurance company
[00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:25.340]   has a lot of money on the line,
[00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:27.300]   but there will also be enough money
[00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:29.760]   that if you settle something at policy limits,
[00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:31.740]   that person will feel satisfied
[00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:33.980]   and their attorney will not feel a need
[00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:35.980]   to come after your personal assets.
[00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:39.540]   So in general, again, I think that's a seven-figure number,
[00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:42.100]   something between one and five million.
[00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:43.980]   And the good news is it's dramatically cheaper
[00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:44.820]   than malpractice.
[00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:48.060]   I might be paying $16,000 a year for malpractice insurance,
[00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:49.980]   but my umbrella policy for twice as much
[00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:52.180]   might only be three or $400 a year.
[00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:53.800]   And so I think it's pretty wise
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:56.740]   to raise up those liability limits on your auto policy
[00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:58.220]   and on your homeowner's policy
[00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:01.200]   and stack a nice, big, fat umbrella on top of it.
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.720]   It's really not that much money.
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:05.980]   And I think it's important coverage to have.
[00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:07.060]   What a lot of people don't realize
[00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:09.900]   is about 80% of the claims on those umbrella policies
[00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:11.260]   are auto-related.
[00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:12.580]   So that is your big risk,
[00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:15.060]   is that you run over somebody that makes a lot of money
[00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:16.620]   and drives a nice Tesla,
[00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:19.220]   or your 16-year-old runs over somebody's kid
[00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:20.060]   or something like that.
[00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:22.660]   Those are your big liability risks,
[00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:24.580]   not so much the person tripping and falling
[00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:26.460]   on the sidewalk in front of your house.
[00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:29.180]   - One area you spend a lot of time on is student loans,
[00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:31.960]   which is a big interest for a lot of people.
[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:32.800]   - Yeah, for sure.
[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:34.320]   The student loan crisis is a big deal.
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:36.900]   You can tell just from looking at what our politicians
[00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:38.740]   are talking about these days.
[00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:42.100]   It really is the elephant in the room
[00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:44.580]   of certainly young physicians.
[00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:48.060]   About 75% of physicians graduate from medical school
[00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:50.900]   with student loans.
[00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:55.620]   It averages about $200,000 for MDs, $250,000 for DOs.
[00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:59.300]   It's about $270,000 for dentists these days.
[00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:01.940]   And then those loans usually go up during residency
[00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:03.980]   before they even get a chance to start paying them off.
[00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:05.460]   They're higher than that.
[00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:07.660]   And I've run into docs, lots of docs,
[00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:11.180]   with $400,000, $500,000, $600,000 in student loans.
[00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:13.040]   My record's about 1.1 million.
[00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:17.460]   - How did somebody accumulate 1.1 million?
[00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:19.180]   - Well, the amazing thing is this is a doc
[00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:22.340]   who came out of undergrad without any student loans at all,
[00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:25.520]   then went to USC for dental school,
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:29.580]   followed by orthodontics residency also at USC.
[00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:32.620]   So it's a relatively high cost of living area,
[00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:34.620]   a very expensive school.
[00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:39.060]   And then he let it ride for a few years at 7% or 8%.
[00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:41.900]   And so the interesting thing about dental residencies
[00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:43.260]   as opposed to medical residencies
[00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:45.420]   is medical residencies pay you a salary.
[00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:49.260]   It's only 50 or $60,000 a year, but it's a salary.
[00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:51.860]   Whereas you go to a lot of dental specialties
[00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:53.180]   and you go to a dental residency
[00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:54.820]   and you're still paying tuition.
[00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:58.100]   And so it's like going to three more years
[00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:00.060]   of medical or dental school in a lot of ways.
[00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:01.400]   And of course, all the old loans
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:03.100]   are continuing to compound interest.
[00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:04.740]   And so it can grow pretty quickly.
[00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:06.140]   And then if you ignore it afterward
[00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:07.640]   and you don't refinance it,
[00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:10.460]   boy, it's not that hard to get over a million dollars.
[00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:12.700]   - How do you pay a $1.1 million school loan?
[00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:14.300]   That must be tough.
[00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:16.380]   - Yeah, I don't think you do.
[00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:17.680]   I mean, the plan of this doctor,
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:19.900]   and he was on the front page of the Wall Street Journal
[00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:22.940]   for it a year or two ago.
[00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:25.420]   His plan is to run it out for 25 years
[00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:27.980]   and take advantage of the income-driven
[00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:30.940]   repayment program's forgiveness.
[00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:33.780]   So you make payments for 25 years and the rest is forgiven.
[00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:36.740]   The issue is you get the tax bomb from that forgiveness.
[00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:40.060]   So you have to be saving up on the side to pay the tax bomb.
[00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:42.500]   And by the time that runs out for 25 years,
[00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:46.420]   he's probably going to have an $800,000 plus
[00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:47.860]   tax bill due from it.
[00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:49.900]   So I hope he's saving for that.
[00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:51.980]   - All this has to be done
[00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:55.820]   even before you start thinking about investing
[00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:57.500]   and where are you going to put your money
[00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:59.460]   and how are you going to save it?
[00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:02.020]   But at some point you're living below your means,
[00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:05.340]   you're making money, you want to start putting money away.
[00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:06.580]   Where do you start?
[00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:08.980]   What do you tell people this is where you begin?
[00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:11.700]   - I think the place to begin,
[00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:13.500]   and a mistake a lot of investors make
[00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:16.100]   is they try to begin with the individual investments.
[00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:19.540]   But the place to begin is with your goals.
[00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:21.780]   And if you talk to most financial advisors,
[00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:24.020]   they'll tell you they spend a great deal of time
[00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:27.100]   trying to get their clients to determine
[00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:29.140]   and say what their actual goals are.
[00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:31.220]   Because once you have a goal,
[00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:33.180]   it simply becomes a math problem.
[00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:36.100]   But until you have a goal, everything is so vague,
[00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:38.100]   it's hard to make any sort of recommendations
[00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:41.940]   about what accounts to use, what asset allocation to use,
[00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:43.460]   what investments to select.
[00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:45.780]   So I think you start with your goals first.
[00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:48.260]   And then you choose what accounts you're going to use
[00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:49.380]   to invest for those goals.
[00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:51.020]   For example, if you're a physician
[00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:52.580]   and you are saving for retirement,
[00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:56.460]   you're probably going to be using a 401k of some type,
[00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:59.340]   maybe a defined benefit cash balance plan,
[00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:01.380]   a personal backdoor Roth IRA,
[00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:04.060]   maybe a spousal backdoor Roth IRA,
[00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:06.140]   and maybe a regular old non-qualified
[00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:08.140]   taxable brokerage account.
[00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:11.220]   And so once you determine those accounts
[00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:12.340]   that you're going to invest in,
[00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:13.900]   the next thing you need to come up with
[00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:16.940]   is some sort of a reasonable asset allocation
[00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:19.540]   or mix of your investments.
[00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:21.460]   You know, and that's likely some combination
[00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:24.380]   of stocks and bonds and real estate.
[00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:27.260]   And once you have that plan written out,
[00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:30.540]   picking the investments is actually the easiest part.
[00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:32.420]   But that is where people tend to go to first.
[00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:34.340]   They go, should I invest in this fund?
[00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:36.100]   And without knowing what their goals are,
[00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:37.180]   what accounts they're in,
[00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:39.420]   or what their desired asset allocation is,
[00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:42.660]   that question can't really be answered effectively at all.
[00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:43.500]   - Because you're a boglehead,
[00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:45.580]   I have to believe you're a big into index funds
[00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:48.300]   and this is what your philosophy is.
[00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:50.220]   - I'm absolutely a huge fan of index funds.
[00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:51.500]   And I have to credit you, Rick,
[00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:56.300]   for a lot of my investing philosophy, quite honestly.
[00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:58.860]   I read several of your books early on
[00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:00.700]   and they had a big influence, I think,
[00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:03.820]   on my asset allocation originally.
[00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:05.900]   And so thank you for that.
[00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:07.980]   I think there are a lot of bogleheads
[00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:12.620]   that owe you a great debt for your writings in that regard.
[00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:14.020]   All About Asset Allocation
[00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:17.220]   was a particularly useful book to me.
[00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:19.500]   You know, it's not the newest book these days,
[00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:20.620]   but when I started investing,
[00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:22.980]   it was fairly new and very, very useful.
[00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:24.620]   - Yeah, well, thanks for reminding me
[00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:25.580]   that I need to update it.
[00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:27.780]   It actually was on my bucket list to do.
[00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:32.220]   - But yes, I invest in index funds.
[00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:34.500]   I basically don't use actively managed funds at all.
[00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:35.740]   I don't pick stocks.
[00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:38.220]   I don't invest in individual bonds.
[00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:40.980]   When I am investing in publicly traded securities,
[00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:43.300]   I'm basically 100% index funds.
[00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:45.180]   So yes, I think that's the best way
[00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:46.940]   to get exposure to an asset class.
[00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:48.340]   It eliminates a lot of risks.
[00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:50.860]   You're no longer running manager risk.
[00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:52.700]   You don't have this underperformance risk.
[00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:54.500]   You're always gonna get the market return
[00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:56.740]   in that particular market.
[00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:58.700]   And you're gonna keep your costs very, very low.
[00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:01.180]   It's gonna be very, very tax efficient.
[00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:02.620]   And the nice thing about it is you don't feel
[00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:04.460]   like you have to watch it.
[00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:07.180]   I don't even have to look at my investments
[00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:09.420]   when the market goes up or down to know what I'm up or down
[00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:12.180]   because I know more or less what the market has done.
[00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:14.860]   And so I think index funds are great.
[00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:19.060]   - I had Paul Merriman on as a guest recently,
[00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:21.900]   and he was talking with me about a conversation
[00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:23.060]   he had with Jack Bogle.
[00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:26.100]   And what Jack Bogle said to him,
[00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:27.980]   I thought was very enlightening.
[00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:29.700]   Of course, a lot of things Jack Bogle said
[00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:30.780]   were very enlightening.
[00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:34.700]   But Paul is what we call the slice and dice guy.
[00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:38.220]   He likes to go to the four corners of the markets
[00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:42.180]   and do value growth, small, large, so forth,
[00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:44.340]   and put all these things together
[00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:45.940]   in a portfolio.
[00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:48.020]   And Jack listened to Paul,
[00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:52.300]   and then he said the problem with that,
[00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:54.500]   the problem with doing that slice and dice
[00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:59.500]   and type of an account is that people will accept
[00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:01.900]   the return of the market.
[00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:05.140]   So if the market goes down 10%
[00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:08.980]   and their stocks go down 10% because they're in index funds,
[00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:12.060]   just flat out straight market funds,
[00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:14.420]   that people will accept that.
[00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:15.980]   And you just said that.
[00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:18.460]   So that's what just reminded me of something.
[00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:22.420]   But what Jack told Paul was that
[00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:26.540]   if your account goes down 15%,
[00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:28.820]   but the market's only down 10,
[00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:30.900]   people won't accept that.
[00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:33.340]   And they'll eventually leave that strategy.
[00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:34.180]   And when they do,
[00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:35.940]   they basically locked in their underperformance.
[00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:37.620]   And so this is the problem.
[00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:38.540]   I thought it was interesting
[00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:40.380]   that you basically said the same thing.
[00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:41.980]   You don't even have to look at your portfolio.
[00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:43.380]   If the market's down, you know you're down.
[00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:44.660]   It's no big deal.
[00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:46.340]   But if you were doing active management
[00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:48.820]   or you were doing some sort of a slice and dice portfolio,
[00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:51.780]   you're gonna wanna know, well, where am I?
[00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:55.220]   And that alone, you going there looking at that
[00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:57.100]   and finding out that you're actually performing
[00:26:57.100 --> 00:26:58.620]   less than the market
[00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:02.180]   could cause you to capitulate on your strategy.
[00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:04.060]   And that will lock in your underperformance.
[00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:05.780]   So I thought it was just interesting
[00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:07.700]   what you said just fell right in line
[00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:10.340]   with what Jack Bogle had told Paul Merriman.
[00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:12.620]   - Yeah, let's talk about that for a minute.
[00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:14.820]   'Cause I probably find myself somewhere
[00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:17.180]   between the total market purists
[00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:21.860]   and the crazy asset class junkie slice and dicers
[00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:22.700]   like Paul Merriman.
[00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:24.220]   I'm probably somewhere in the middle.
[00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:27.100]   I do have a small value tilt in my portfolio.
[00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:29.860]   Over the last decade, that has not paid off.
[00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:30.860]   There's no doubt about it.
[00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:32.940]   And the question you were left with
[00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:35.500]   after that decade of underperformance
[00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:40.500]   is that because the small value factor isn't real
[00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:43.940]   that it was just a product of data mining,
[00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:46.220]   of using retrospective data,
[00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:48.100]   or is this just one of the periods
[00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:51.300]   of inevitable underperformance that you would expect
[00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:53.940]   with tilting your portfolio to something like that?
[00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:55.500]   And of course I'm sticking with it.
[00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:57.340]   And so I obviously believe the latter,
[00:27:57.340 --> 00:28:00.540]   but it's entirely possible that it is the former.
[00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:02.740]   People talk about evidence-based investing
[00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:05.540]   and looking at what has worked in the past.
[00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:08.700]   And the problem is we don't have a lot of data.
[00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:12.020]   We've only got a hundred years of decent data,
[00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:14.860]   maybe another hundred years of okay data.
[00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:17.220]   And the problem is it's such a complex system.
[00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:18.340]   This isn't physics.
[00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:19.660]   Investing is not physics.
[00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:22.660]   There are no guarantees that small and value stocks
[00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:24.100]   or whatever tilt you want,
[00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:27.140]   momentum stocks or whatever is going to work out
[00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:30.780]   over your 30 to 60 year investment horizon.
[00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:32.300]   And so in some ways,
[00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:35.660]   you are making a little bit of a bet doing that.
[00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:37.340]   But I do believe the risk story
[00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:39.140]   behind small and value stocks,
[00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:40.340]   I think in the long run,
[00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:42.700]   I'm probably going to be rewarded for that.
[00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:44.740]   But I think it's really important
[00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:48.780]   not to tilt your portfolio more than you believe,
[00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:51.380]   because the worst thing you can do is, you know,
[00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:55.460]   stick with a small value tilt, for instance, for 10 years,
[00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:57.180]   and then bail on it just in time
[00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:59.860]   for small value stocks to outperform the market.
[00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:02.220]   You've got to stick with the plan in the long run.
[00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:05.060]   If this sort of a factor tilt is going to work,
[00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:08.220]   it's only going to work in the very long run.
[00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:13.220]   I call it a lifelong investment strategy.
[00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:17.260]   If you're going to go down that path of saying,
[00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:21.780]   I'm willing to take more risk with small cap value
[00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:25.260]   because I want to potentially get a higher rate of return.
[00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:30.060]   It's not something that you can just do for a few years.
[00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:33.940]   You have to make it a career, like a marriage.
[00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:37.980]   I mean, you're marrying it for the rest of your life.
[00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:42.980]   I will say also that I agree with you on the idea,
[00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:48.340]   evidence-based investing, smart beta, strategic beta,
[00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:53.620]   all of these very scientific sounding ways of investing
[00:29:53.620 --> 00:30:00.660]   have made it appear as though this stuff is a certainty
[00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:03.100]   when it is not a certainty.
[00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:04.500]   It is a risk.
[00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:07.620]   And if you're going to go down this path,
[00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:09.340]   you have to realize that it is a risk
[00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:13.980]   and you may not be rewarded, but no matter what happens,
[00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:15.780]   you have to stick with it for the longterm.
[00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:19.780]   And if you're not going to stick with it for the longterm,
[00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:22.220]   then don't do it to begin with.
[00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:27.220]   Just do total stock market, US, total international,
[00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:32.100]   a bond fund on your public markets and be done with it.
[00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:34.340]   - Absolutely, I agree with that.
[00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:35.860]   If you cannot stick with the longterm,
[00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:38.980]   you are far better off with even something more simple,
[00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:41.540]   maybe even a target retirement type fund.
[00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:43.140]   The other thing a lot of the slice and dicers
[00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:45.100]   don't realize until they've been running
[00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:48.180]   a slice and dice portfolio for a number of years,
[00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:49.940]   especially if they're like the typical physician
[00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:52.060]   and they have their assets spread across six or eight
[00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:53.940]   or more different accounts,
[00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:56.300]   is this is a management nightmare
[00:30:56.300 --> 00:31:00.420]   to have 10 asset classes spread across eight accounts.
[00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:04.180]   I mean, it is, you've got a seriously complex spreadsheet
[00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:06.180]   just to rebalance your portfolio.
[00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:08.180]   And that's going to cost you some time,
[00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:10.780]   maybe some errors, maybe some tracking error.
[00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:12.740]   And there's some additional expenses,
[00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:14.740]   buying and selling across all of those accounts,
[00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:18.100]   especially if they are in a taxable account.
[00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:21.020]   And so don't underestimate just how much work
[00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:22.140]   it's going to be to manage
[00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:24.260]   a really complex portfolio going forward.
[00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:26.940]   - I do want to get into one area though
[00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:28.980]   that you have a big interest in.
[00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:30.980]   And I can tell by going to your website
[00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:34.220]   and just looking at your sponsors and your advertisers,
[00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:35.620]   it's real estate.
[00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:40.620]   I find it interesting that you are a proponent
[00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:44.340]   and a pretty big proponent of doing real estate.
[00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:46.660]   So could you get into this in quite a bit of detail
[00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:47.500]   if you can?
[00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:48.780]   How do you view it?
[00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:49.940]   How do you get into it?
[00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:52.980]   Why should people, if they're going to get into it,
[00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:56.300]   do it the way that you're talking about on your website?
[00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:58.020]   - Sure, well, let's talk about real estate.
[00:31:58.020 --> 00:32:00.780]   And there's obviously a lot of different ways to do it
[00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:02.300]   if you want to do it.
[00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:06.140]   But the first thing I think that is worth saying
[00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:08.980]   is what drove me to start looking a little more closely
[00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:10.540]   at real estate in the first place.
[00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:13.100]   Now, my investing background is kind of Boglehead-ish.
[00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:14.740]   You know, it came from books like yours,
[00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:15.980]   like those of Larry Swedrow,
[00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:18.580]   those of Jack Bogle and William Bernstein,
[00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:21.020]   and a lot of time spent on the Bogleheads Forum.
[00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:23.860]   My background in investing is certainly mutual fund
[00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:26.780]   and index fund in particular based.
[00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:29.060]   But I kept running into these people
[00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:32.100]   who had built substantial wealth,
[00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:33.620]   substantial passive income,
[00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:37.140]   and had substantial success investing in real estate
[00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:38.780]   in various different ways.
[00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:39.740]   And I said, you know what?
[00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:41.340]   This is not a flash in the pan.
[00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:42.980]   This is not Bitcoin.
[00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:45.620]   These are serious investors who are taking this seriously,
[00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:49.940]   who are managing risk, and who are having good returns,
[00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:51.820]   and who are finding success.
[00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:54.660]   And they have 80% or more of their portfolio
[00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:56.300]   invested in real estate.
[00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:57.260]   And so I thought, well,
[00:32:57.260 --> 00:32:59.380]   let's look at it a little bit more closely.
[00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:02.740]   And real estate has a few big advantages.
[00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:06.980]   The first is that the returns are both high
[00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:11.100]   and relatively less correlated with the stock market.
[00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:12.500]   And which is exactly what you want
[00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:15.100]   when you're adding an asset class to your portfolio.
[00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:16.140]   It's great to have something
[00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:18.620]   that doesn't have any correlation to your portfolio,
[00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:19.940]   but if it's beanie babies
[00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:21.940]   and there's no actual long-term return,
[00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:23.860]   that's not actually gonna help all that much.
[00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:26.700]   You need high returns and low correlation with your stocks.
[00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:29.420]   And so real estate meets that requirement.
[00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:32.100]   Another exciting thing about real estate
[00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:36.940]   is the fact that it is much easier to leverage safely
[00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:38.860]   than a stock portfolio.
[00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:41.420]   You know, as you know, if you go decide to invest on margin,
[00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:42.900]   you can only invest so much.
[00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:44.420]   If the market really tanks,
[00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:45.740]   you're gonna get a margin call
[00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:47.020]   and you're gonna have to come up with cash
[00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:48.780]   at the worst possible moment.
[00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:50.660]   But when you're leveraging real estate,
[00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:52.780]   you're often doing it with a fixed mortgage
[00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:55.820]   that might go out 10, 15, 30 years,
[00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:58.940]   which gives you time to write out any inevitable downturn
[00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:01.540]   so long as the property is cash flowing.
[00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:03.820]   So that leverage I think is a big advantage.
[00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:07.420]   Another big advantage is depreciation.
[00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:08.900]   And a lot of people don't understand
[00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:11.380]   just how valuable of an advantage that is.
[00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:14.580]   The idea is as you carry this investment through the years,
[00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:16.420]   you're getting income from it,
[00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:18.780]   but most or even all of that income
[00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:21.380]   is sheltered by depreciation.
[00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:23.140]   And then, so over the years,
[00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:26.700]   five, 10, 15, 20 years, you're depreciating this property.
[00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:28.540]   And then instead of selling it
[00:34:28.540 --> 00:34:32.980]   and having to recapture that depreciation,
[00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:34.180]   even though you're able to recapture it
[00:34:34.180 --> 00:34:36.420]   at a lower tax rate,
[00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:38.980]   instead of recapturing that, you exchange the property.
[00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:40.860]   You know, it's the classic monopoly thing.
[00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:43.980]   You go from houses to hotels, you exchange the property,
[00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:47.500]   and then that depreciation isn't recaptured at all.
[00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:49.460]   It's basically moved into the next property.
[00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:53.100]   And so you exchange, exchange, exchange, exchange, die.
[00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:55.940]   And at the end, your heirs get to step up in basis at death
[00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:58.980]   and nobody ever recaptures that depreciation.
[00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:01.500]   And so that's a really big tax benefit.
[00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:03.900]   One of the big downsides of mutual funds
[00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:07.420]   is they don't pass through a lot of the tax benefits
[00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:09.420]   that I would love to see them pass through.
[00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:10.460]   You know, it just doesn't happen
[00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:13.060]   because of the way they are structured.
[00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:16.580]   And so those are, I think, the big poles with real estate.
[00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:18.860]   The question then becomes, well, how?
[00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:20.580]   How do you invest in it?
[00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:22.220]   And what most people think about
[00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:24.620]   is they think about buying the property down the street.
[00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:26.940]   They think about buying a single family home,
[00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:29.140]   managing it, getting tenants in there,
[00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:32.340]   taking care of the tenants' 3 a.m. toilet calls,
[00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:33.500]   you know, evicting the tenants
[00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:34.820]   when the tenants stop paying rent.
[00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:35.940]   And it sounds like a big headache.
[00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:37.500]   It sounds like a second job.
[00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:39.940]   And so people go, I don't want a second job.
[00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:41.980]   I'll just stick with mutual funds.
[00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:42.940]   What they don't realize,
[00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:45.660]   especially for an accredited investor,
[00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:47.140]   is there are other options.
[00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:49.140]   You know, you can look at two options
[00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:50.900]   if you're a non-accredited investor.
[00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:53.380]   The two options are basically buy single family homes
[00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:56.180]   or duplexes, manage them yourself or hire a manager.
[00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:57.820]   And on the other end of the spectrum,
[00:35:57.820 --> 00:36:00.060]   just going to the publicly traded markets
[00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:03.860]   and buying a real estate index trust index fund.
[00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:04.780]   Very passive.
[00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:07.580]   You don't get all the benefits of real estate.
[00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:08.420]   You know, for example,
[00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:10.500]   you don't get the depreciation passing through, et cetera.
[00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:12.060]   It's not very tax efficient.
[00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:14.100]   It tends to go up and down with the market a lot more
[00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:16.380]   than individually held real estate.
[00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:17.860]   But it's very hassle free.
[00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:19.860]   So if you put that on one side of the spectrum
[00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:21.180]   and you put these single family homes
[00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:22.500]   on the other side of the spectrum,
[00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:25.900]   you start asking yourself, well, what is there in between?
[00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:28.020]   And there's a number of things that are in between.
[00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:31.740]   They're generally only available to accredited investors.
[00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:34.860]   They tend to be syndications or funds,
[00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:37.660]   which basically buy multiple syndications.
[00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:38.620]   So by a syndication,
[00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:42.140]   I mean that you get together with 20 or 50
[00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:43.860]   or a hundred other investors
[00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:45.900]   and you buy an apartment complex.
[00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:48.620]   Maybe it's 300 doors in the apartment complex.
[00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:49.860]   You're never gonna have enough money
[00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:53.060]   to buy this $20 million apartment complex by yourself.
[00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:54.480]   But if you pool your money together
[00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:55.860]   with a hundred other investors,
[00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:57.480]   you know, just like in a mutual fund,
[00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:00.620]   you can go in and you can buy this apartment complex.
[00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:02.540]   You get some efficiencies of scale there
[00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:06.020]   rather than trying to buy two or three single family homes.
[00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:08.820]   You get, you're bringing in enough money there
[00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:10.780]   to pay for professional manager
[00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:12.620]   and you still get the depreciation
[00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:14.540]   and other benefits passed through to you.
[00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:16.780]   And once you select the syndication,
[00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:18.180]   it's essentially passive.
[00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:20.700]   You know, just like an index fund would be
[00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:22.740]   that you're just getting mailbox money every quarter
[00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:24.860]   or every six months or whatever the deal is
[00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:26.420]   with the syndication.
[00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:27.780]   The downside of course,
[00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:30.140]   is that there are significant level of fees.
[00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:31.660]   You know, the people running the syndication
[00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:33.780]   are not gonna do this for free.
[00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:35.700]   And they're gonna charge some of those fees,
[00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:39.380]   whether the syndication or the fund does well or not.
[00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:41.980]   And then some are typically performance-based.
[00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:43.940]   And then of course the other big downside
[00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:46.060]   is these investments are not liquid.
[00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:49.420]   You cannot go and sell these any given day in the markets.
[00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:52.100]   Once you invest, you are basically stuck
[00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:55.940]   for two, five, maybe 10 years in this investment.
[00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:59.140]   And so I think you probably get paid a little bit
[00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:01.820]   of an illiquidity premium for doing that,
[00:38:01.820 --> 00:38:03.220]   but I can't prove it.
[00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:04.720]   And if you're giving up your liquidity
[00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:06.660]   for no additional premium,
[00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:08.460]   that might not be that smart of a move.
[00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:10.940]   So you need to limit it to enough of your portfolio
[00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:14.140]   that you're okay being illiquid on that.
[00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:18.620]   - You talked about having these limited partnerships
[00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:20.100]   in an account.
[00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:23.900]   Do you find that they're better in a tax deferred account
[00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:25.380]   or a taxable account?
[00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:29.340]   - In general, the equity syndications,
[00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:31.820]   I like having in a taxable account.
[00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:33.400]   And the reason why is if you put them
[00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:35.420]   in a self-directed IRA,
[00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:38.700]   you end up with an unrelated business tax.
[00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:42.740]   And so this UBIT tax that affects it.
[00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:45.140]   Now you can get out of that in a self-directed 401k,
[00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:47.140]   but most people, if they're trying to put these things
[00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:49.940]   into a tax protected account,
[00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:51.700]   they're doing it in a self-directed IRA
[00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:53.100]   or self-directed Roth IRA.
[00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:54.820]   And so the equity deals,
[00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:57.660]   I kind of prefer in a taxable account.
[00:38:57.660 --> 00:39:01.220]   But other deals are actually debt deals.
[00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:05.580]   For example, if you go to a private lending fund
[00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:08.260]   and you give them $50,000 or $100,000
[00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:11.340]   or $250,000, and they are using that,
[00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:12.980]   they pooled it with a bunch of other investors
[00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:15.660]   and they're using that to lend to developers.
[00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:18.020]   People that are basically taking out these short-term loans,
[00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:20.060]   six month loans, 12 month loans.
[00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:23.140]   These people borrowing the money might be paying 10 or 12%
[00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:26.060]   plus a couple of points on the money.
[00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:29.140]   And then of course, this fund has got 50 or 100
[00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:31.720]   different of these loans in it.
[00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:34.380]   But then basically all of this income is taxable
[00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:36.820]   at your ordinary income tax rate every year.
[00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:39.740]   And so it's not a very tax efficient investment.
[00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:42.460]   So if you're investing in a debt fund or a debt deal,
[00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:44.020]   that's probably a pretty good thing
[00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:47.940]   to put inside a self-directed IRA or a self-directed 401k,
[00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:50.120]   just because it's not very tax efficient.
[00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:53.780]   - Now, most IRAs and 401ks
[00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:56.180]   do not allow these type of investments.
[00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:58.820]   How do you get around that?
[00:39:58.820 --> 00:40:01.380]   - Well, you're not gonna be able to go to Vanguard
[00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:05.100]   or Fidelity or Schwab and open up your typical IRA
[00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:07.500]   and be able to invest in these sorts of investments.
[00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:09.020]   You have to go to a smaller shop
[00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:11.980]   that basically offers a self-directed IRA
[00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:14.460]   or a self-directed individual 401k.
[00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:16.900]   These are checkbook IRAs,
[00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:20.740]   where basically it forms an LLC with a bank account
[00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:23.900]   and you can write checks out of the bank account.
[00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:25.580]   So anytime you invest in something,
[00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:27.340]   you write the check out of this bank account
[00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:30.540]   inside the LLC that's owned by the IRA.
[00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:31.940]   And when it pays off income,
[00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:33.680]   it goes back into that bank account
[00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:37.380]   that's owned by the LLC that is owned by the IRA.
[00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:39.740]   And so obviously this can't be a summer home
[00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:42.420]   that you're gonna live in, that's not permitted.
[00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:45.260]   And you can't take the money out and spend it,
[00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:46.900]   that's an IRA withdrawal.
[00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:49.180]   So you're gonna end up paying taxes and penalties
[00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:51.020]   if you take the money out of there,
[00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:53.240]   at least while you're in the accumulation stage.
[00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:55.460]   So you have to be very careful to keep it separate
[00:40:55.460 --> 00:40:57.560]   if you're gonna do that sort of a thing.
[00:40:57.560 --> 00:40:58.880]   But there are plenty of people
[00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:01.380]   that have these self-directed IRAs.
[00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:02.740]   The fees are a little bit higher
[00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:04.060]   than you're gonna pay at Vanguard.
[00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:06.580]   For example, you go open a Roth IRA at Vanguard,
[00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:07.980]   there's basically no fees
[00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:10.100]   other than the expense ratio on the mutual funds.
[00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:11.300]   But if you go to one of these shops,
[00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:14.180]   it might cost you $500 to open the fund
[00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:17.360]   and you might be paying something like $125 a year
[00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:19.620]   to keep that self-directed IRA open.
[00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:21.260]   So the fees are definitely coming down.
[00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:24.320]   There's a lot more of these around than there used to be,
[00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:26.300]   but there's no doubt that it costs a little bit more
[00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:27.660]   to invest this way.
[00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:30.700]   And you've got to make sure that it is worth it to you
[00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:33.140]   to have the additional diversification
[00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:37.660]   and to have the potentially higher returns.
[00:41:37.660 --> 00:41:40.140]   Whether that's actually the case or not, it's hard to tell
[00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:43.580]   because there is no morning star for these investments.
[00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:47.760]   There's no Jack Bogle database common sense on mutual funds
[00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:49.500]   that has looked at all of these.
[00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:53.440]   And so in a lot of ways, it's a little bit similar
[00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:56.420]   to being out there trying to choose the winners
[00:41:56.420 --> 00:41:58.460]   and avoid the losers, which as we've seen
[00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:00.780]   with picking stocks in particular
[00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:02.380]   is a very difficult thing to do.
[00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:06.460]   - So that was actually my last question on real estate.
[00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:10.420]   And that has to do with how many of these deals
[00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:11.380]   do you want to do?
[00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:15.380]   I'm thinking, okay, if I want to put $250,000
[00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:18.340]   into these real estate limited partnerships,
[00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:21.340]   personally, I would say, what's the minimum?
[00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:22.540]   Yeah, is it 25,000?
[00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:26.060]   If it's 25,000, I want to buy 10, 10 different ones.
[00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:26.900]   Is that?
[00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:29.480]   - That's exactly the issue is the minimums
[00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:31.260]   tend to price a lot of people out.
[00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:34.460]   And so if your nest egg is $500,000,
[00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:36.100]   I mean, you're probably shouldn't be investing
[00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:38.860]   in these things at all because they're almost never
[00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:42.020]   have minimums less than $25,000.
[00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:45.900]   Those minimums are often 25, 50, sometimes $100,000.
[00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:49.540]   The really high end ones are sometimes 250,000
[00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:51.460]   or a million dollars a piece.
[00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:53.940]   And they often require you to be a qualified purchaser,
[00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:57.220]   which is even more than just being an accredited investor.
[00:42:57.220 --> 00:43:00.240]   And so you have to be realistic about this.
[00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:02.300]   You want to be diversified.
[00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:05.660]   You're not going to put 40% of your portfolio
[00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:08.060]   into one limited partnership.
[00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:12.860]   For example, my portfolio calls for having 5% of my money
[00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:15.180]   in these private lending funds.
[00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:19.000]   And so if you're going to have 5% of your money in a fund
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:22.800]   and you want to have at least three of them or so,
[00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:25.580]   so you're at least somewhat diversified there,
[00:43:25.580 --> 00:43:28.060]   then you're obviously going to have to have a portfolio
[00:43:28.060 --> 00:43:30.100]   that is substantially sized.
[00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:32.140]   Because if you only have a million dollar portfolio,
[00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:34.220]   5% of that is only $50,000.
[00:43:34.220 --> 00:43:36.220]   If these things all have $50,000 minimums,
[00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:37.660]   you're not going to be able to be diversified
[00:43:37.660 --> 00:43:39.300]   in that asset class.
[00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:41.980]   And so I think there's some wisdom in avoiding this
[00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:44.220]   until you have a portfolio of a certain size,
[00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:47.040]   not necessarily because you have to invest differently
[00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:48.780]   at a large portfolio size,
[00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:51.680]   but simply because you have to have something that big
[00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:55.140]   in order to maintain a reasonable level of diversification.
[00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:58.920]   - So Jim, just to put a cap on this real estate,
[00:43:58.920 --> 00:43:59.940]   you've mentioned different ways
[00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:01.820]   in which you can invest in real estate,
[00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:04.060]   through REITs, through debt funds,
[00:44:04.060 --> 00:44:06.980]   through private limited partnerships
[00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:09.840]   that invest in apartments and so forth.
[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:12.300]   Could you tell us what your own portfolio,
[00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:15.740]   how much you have allocated and how it's allocated?
[00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:16.820]   - Sure, absolutely.
[00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:20.840]   So my portfolio is still 85% index funds.
[00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:25.580]   So it's 60% stock and 40% of the portfolio is in U.S. stock,
[00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:28.920]   a total stock market fund and a small value fund.
[00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:31.640]   20% of the portfolio is in international stocks,
[00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:34.420]   basically the total international stock market fund
[00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:38.620]   and the international small fund there at Vanguard.
[00:44:38.620 --> 00:44:41.100]   And then I've got 20% in bonds.
[00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:43.380]   I use the TSPG fund for most of them,
[00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:45.340]   but I've got some money
[00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:48.860]   in the Vanguard Intermediate Muni Bond Index Fund.
[00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:53.680]   And then 10% of my portfolio in a TIPS fund.
[00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:56.160]   And then the last 20% is in real estate.
[00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:57.360]   So 5% of that is in the
[00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:00.300]   Vanguard Real Estate Investment Trust Index Fund.
[00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:04.340]   And then the last 15% is in these kind of private investments
[00:45:04.340 --> 00:45:05.180]   that I've talked about.
[00:45:05.180 --> 00:45:09.340]   About 5% in debt funds and 10% in equity deals,
[00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:13.820]   whether they're individual syndications or private funds
[00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:17.580]   that are basically eight or 10 or 15 syndications
[00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:19.840]   rolled up into one big fund.
[00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:23.200]   - You know, Jim, we hear a lot about the FIRE movement,
[00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:26.000]   Financial Independence, Retire Early.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   Everything you write about,
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.220]   the 12-step program and everything,
[00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:31.200]   that is the FIRE movement.
[00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:33.640]   Do you consider yourself part of this movement?
[00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:37.900]   - You know, I don't think I'm actually part of the movement.
[00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:40.520]   I'm technically financially independent.
[00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:43.020]   I don't need to work for money at this point.
[00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:45.840]   But obviously, I'm not only working, I'm doing two jobs.
[00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:47.280]   You know, I'm running the White Coat Investor
[00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:49.280]   and I'm still practicing medicine.
[00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:53.280]   And so, the Retire Early part doesn't quite fit me.
[00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:56.040]   I think I'd probably be bored if I wasn't working at all,
[00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:58.000]   although I have lots of outside interests.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:45:59.560]   Mostly, I just feel really passionately
[00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:01.520]   about what I'm doing, both at the hospital
[00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:05.400]   and in helping high-income professionals
[00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:08.280]   like physicians and dentists and attorneys, et cetera,
[00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:10.180]   to get a fair shake on Wall Street.
[00:46:10.180 --> 00:46:12.140]   And so, I don't know that it fits me so much,
[00:46:12.140 --> 00:46:14.040]   but certainly the principles are all the same.
[00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:17.240]   I mean, FIRE is really just a matter of saving up
[00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:21.720]   25 to 30 times your annual living expenses
[00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:24.000]   and then realizing you don't have to work for money.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.440]   Now, you might still work for money,
[00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:27.840]   but you don't have to work for money.
[00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:30.020]   And that's really all FIRE is.
[00:46:30.020 --> 00:46:33.960]   That said, I think a lot of people that are into FIRE
[00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:35.520]   might just need a different job,
[00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:39.960]   a job they feel more passionately about that is more fun.
[00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:43.320]   I meet a lot of burned out docs, and you know what?
[00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:46.560]   If they would just cut back to full-time even,
[00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:48.160]   'cause so many of them are working more than full-time,
[00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:49.820]   they just cut back to full-time,
[00:46:49.820 --> 00:46:51.680]   they would remind themselves of the joy
[00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:53.560]   they found in their career in the first place
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:56.920]   and why they spent their entire 20s training to do it.
[00:46:56.920 --> 00:46:58.360]   And so, I think there's a lot of people
[00:46:58.360 --> 00:47:01.720]   that are maybe not in jobs they enjoy,
[00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:03.060]   that if they could just find out
[00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:04.800]   what they wanna do for their life,
[00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:06.840]   they might realize that it actually does come
[00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:09.800]   with a paycheck, and that's okay.
[00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:13.040]   So, I don't know that I'm a specific FIRE groupie
[00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:13.880]   by any means.
[00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:15.400]   I understand the principles.
[00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:20.760]   I think it's useful, but it just would seem sad to me
[00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:25.000]   to punch out of the workforce at 35
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.760]   and spend the rest of my time rock climbing
[00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:28.840]   and traveling around the world.
[00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:31.620]   What I suspect would happen is I'd be back by 40
[00:47:31.620 --> 00:47:34.360]   trying to do something that I found meaning in
[00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:35.200]   with the life.
[00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:37.960]   But the nice thing about being financially independent
[00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:41.760]   is you can choose something that you find meaningful
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:43.200]   that doesn't come with a paycheck
[00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:45.560]   or doesn't come with much of a paycheck.
[00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:47.080]   And so, I think it would be good
[00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:49.660]   if more people understood the principles of FIRE,
[00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:53.080]   even if they choose not to necessarily retire early.
[00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:56.080]   - Jim, every time I have a guest on the show,
[00:47:56.080 --> 00:47:59.280]   I'll post who that guest is going to be
[00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:02.040]   a couple of weeks prior to the interview
[00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:04.480]   and the Bogleheads on bogleheads.org
[00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:07.120]   will come up and ask their questions
[00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:11.280]   that they would like me to ask you and the other guests.
[00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:13.480]   So, the following questions I'm gonna ask you
[00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:16.560]   came from the Bogleheads forum.
[00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:19.760]   And of course, one of them has a near and dear to my heart.
[00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:21.520]   And so, I'm gonna ask the question,
[00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:26.160]   what's a fair fee to pay an advisor
[00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:29.700]   for both the asset under management model
[00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:32.880]   and under the hourly fee model?
[00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:35.880]   Now, be careful because you know I'm an hourly fee advisor.
[00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:39.120]   - Yeah, I think the general advice
[00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:41.440]   for somebody who wants to hire somebody
[00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:45.840]   to do both financial planning and asset management
[00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:49.520]   is that a fair price is a four figure amount per year,
[00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:52.400]   somewhere between a thousand and $10,000.
[00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:54.920]   If you are paying more than $10,000 a year,
[00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:58.280]   I can almost surely find you an advisor
[00:48:58.280 --> 00:49:01.960]   who will do at least as good of a job for less money.
[00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:05.520]   But whether that is charged as an asset under management fee,
[00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:08.040]   an annual retainer or an hourly rate,
[00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:09.760]   I am not as particular on,
[00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:12.160]   so long as you do the math each year.
[00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:14.600]   The problem is some people don't do the math each year.
[00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:17.460]   When you have a $100,000 portfolio,
[00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:21.200]   paying 1% a year is a screaming deal.
[00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:23.040]   When you have a million dollar portfolio,
[00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:24.740]   it's not nearly as good of a deal.
[00:49:24.740 --> 00:49:26.760]   When you have a $5 million portfolio,
[00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:28.320]   you're being ripped off.
[00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:30.360]   And so, you've gotta do the math each year
[00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:32.840]   and compare that to what you could get it for
[00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:36.000]   as a flat fee or as an hourly rate.
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:39.040]   Certainly, there is more of a push in the last few years
[00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:40.960]   to move from asset under management fees
[00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:44.920]   toward hourly rates or toward a set annual fee
[00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:49.240]   for asset management or for creation of a financial plan.
[00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:50.640]   And I think that's a good thing.
[00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:54.840]   I think having more options there is very, very helpful.
[00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:58.120]   And I think that we're gonna see
[00:49:58.120 --> 00:50:01.520]   a lot more financial advisors charging under that model,
[00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:03.320]   maybe being a little bit more transparent
[00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:06.040]   and encouraging people to actually understand
[00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:07.880]   what they're paying in fees.
[00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:11.000]   So, a lot of people these days are really anti-AUM.
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:14.360]   I don't think we necessarily have to be anti-AUM,
[00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:17.440]   but the problem is a lot of AUM charging advisors
[00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:21.160]   do not scale back those AUM fees as the portfolio grows
[00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:23.200]   nearly as fast as they should.
[00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:25.840]   And so, at that point, as your portfolio grows,
[00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:29.080]   you've either got to be able to negotiate that rate down
[00:50:29.080 --> 00:50:30.760]   or you gotta start looking for another advisor
[00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:32.280]   because it just doesn't make any sense
[00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:34.640]   to be paying $30,000, $40,000, $50,000 a year
[00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:36.840]   in advisory fees as that portfolio grows.
[00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:42.720]   AUM itself isn't inherently a bad way to charge.
[00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:45.480]   It's just that it has to be aligned
[00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:47.960]   with the amount of work the advisor is actually doing.
[00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:51.920]   And as you said, for $100,000, it is aligned,
[00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:54.480]   but when you get up to a million-dollar account
[00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:57.240]   and you're paying 10,000, it's no longer in alignment.
[00:50:57.240 --> 00:50:59.080]   It doesn't take any more time
[00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:01.240]   to manage a million-dollar portfolio
[00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:03.120]   than it does a $100,000 portfolio.
[00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:05.400]   It's just that the fee is 10 times more.
[00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:06.400]   - Agreed.
[00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:08.280]   - Let me get to another issue here.
[00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:10.600]   It has to do with robo-advisors.
[00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:12.240]   I'm talking about Wealthfront, Betterment,
[00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:14.440]   and a number of others.
[00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:17.480]   How do you feel about these robo-platforms
[00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:19.480]   where you just send them money
[00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:22.280]   and they invest in a series of ETFs
[00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:25.900]   and do rebalancing and tax management and everything else?
[00:51:25.900 --> 00:51:27.920]   - I think they're great for a few reasons.
[00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:31.360]   First, they kind of put some downward pressure
[00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:34.880]   on advisory fees, on asset management fees.
[00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:36.580]   When somebody says, "Well, I can go to Betterment
[00:51:36.580 --> 00:51:39.040]   "for 0.3 or whatever they're charging right now,
[00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:40.460]   "and you want to charge me 0.8.
[00:51:40.460 --> 00:51:41.560]   "What are you doing that's better
[00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:43.120]   "than what Betterment's doing?"
[00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:45.400]   So I like that aspect of it.
[00:51:45.400 --> 00:51:48.520]   The problem is I don't think these are very practical
[00:51:48.520 --> 00:51:50.520]   for very many physicians.
[00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:54.080]   And the reason why is they generally don't do your 401(k)
[00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:56.480]   or other employer plans.
[00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:57.960]   So they'll do your taxable account,
[00:51:57.960 --> 00:51:59.880]   they'll do your IRA or Roth IRA,
[00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:02.920]   but they generally won't do your 401(k), et cetera.
[00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:04.640]   And so that leaves you in a position
[00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:07.440]   of what am I gonna do with the 401(k)?
[00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:10.880]   And you either have to learn to do it yourself,
[00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:11.880]   which brings on the question,
[00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:13.500]   "Well, if you can do the 401(k) yourself,
[00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:15.880]   "why can't you do the IRA yourself?"
[00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:19.260]   Or you hire an advisor, which brings on the question,
[00:52:19.260 --> 00:52:21.460]   "If you need an advisor for your 401(k),
[00:52:21.460 --> 00:52:22.760]   "why aren't you just having that advisor
[00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:24.840]   "manage the entire portfolio?"
[00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:27.120]   And so I think there's actually a pretty small niche
[00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:31.400]   of people for whom a robo-advisor is the right solution.
[00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:33.120]   The other issue I think people run into,
[00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:35.640]   particularly in a taxable account,
[00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:38.320]   is they might have these rather complex portfolios,
[00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:41.120]   and they're usually low cost and they're usually reasonable,
[00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:42.880]   but they're fairly complex.
[00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:43.980]   And so all of a sudden,
[00:52:43.980 --> 00:52:45.760]   you've been in this robo-advisor account
[00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:47.920]   for two or three years, it's made some money,
[00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:49.880]   so you have some capital gains in there,
[00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:52.640]   and you decide you don't wanna do that anymore,
[00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:56.000]   but now you've got 15 different holdings to unwind,
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:59.560]   because that's how the robo-advisor has been managing it,
[00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:01.340]   between all the tax loss harvesting
[00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:03.160]   and trying to be diversified
[00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:05.660]   and trying to be complex enough to earn their fee.
[00:53:05.660 --> 00:53:08.880]   And so I think people run into a few problems like that
[00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:10.800]   if their goal was only to use the robo-advisor
[00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:11.920]   for a couple of years,
[00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:14.600]   and then either go to a regular advisor
[00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:16.360]   or do it on their own.
[00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:17.360]   I think in a lot of ways,
[00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:19.480]   people would be better off just choosing a life strategy
[00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:22.040]   or target retirement fund for those years
[00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:25.000]   when a robo-advisor is the right thing for them to do.
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:27.640]   - I think you're absolutely right
[00:53:27.640 --> 00:53:30.440]   about robo-advisors in tax-deferred accounts,
[00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:34.120]   where when you decide to leave the robo-advisor
[00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:37.100]   and go do something else after a while,
[00:53:37.100 --> 00:53:38.520]   you could sell all those securities
[00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:39.800]   and not have to worry about taxes.
[00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:41.760]   But I just looked at a,
[00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:45.320]   one of the robo-advisors did a portfolio
[00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:49.080]   for a client of mine, 40 different, four zero,
[00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:52.840]   40 different ETFs in a taxable account.
[00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:56.720]   I mean, it is so convoluted and so confusing.
[00:53:56.720 --> 00:53:59.120]   This was a well-known robo-advisor.
[00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:02.020]   I mean, this is not an obscure one.
[00:54:02.020 --> 00:54:04.720]   And as you're doing this tax loss harvesting
[00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:08.200]   and taking losses here, taking losses there,
[00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:10.720]   and swapping from these funds to those funds,
[00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:15.200]   in a taxable account, it becomes a growing furball.
[00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:17.800]   And if you try to get out of it, it's just a mess.
[00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:20.960]   You really lose track of what this thing is.
[00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:25.240]   So I'm all for the robos and IRA accounts
[00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:28.520]   and SEP IRAs, simple IRAs, things like that.
[00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:30.760]   But when it comes to a taxable account,
[00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:33.420]   I just prefer a total stock market index fund,
[00:54:33.420 --> 00:54:36.560]   total international index fund, leave it at that,
[00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:39.280]   do all the other stuff and tax-deferred accounts,
[00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:40.240]   my view of it.
[00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:42.440]   - Yeah, I think there's a lot of wisdom there.
[00:54:42.440 --> 00:54:44.040]   And in fact, if you look what's actually
[00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:46.760]   in my taxable account, it's total stock market,
[00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:48.680]   total international stock market,
[00:54:48.680 --> 00:54:52.280]   a municipal bond fund and some real estate holdings.
[00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:54.320]   - Well, let's get into the last Boglehead question
[00:54:54.320 --> 00:54:55.200]   before we wrap up.
[00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:58.960]   And it has to do with investments for the future
[00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:02.800]   and particularly cyber currencies.
[00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:05.240]   Do you see a future for this?
[00:55:05.240 --> 00:55:09.840]   - Wow, my crystal ball is cloudy as always.
[00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:13.080]   I thought it was fascinating to watch the Bitcoin bubble
[00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:14.240]   a year ago or so.
[00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:17.080]   I mean, it was a classic mania.
[00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:19.560]   But instead of it happening over a few years
[00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:23.080]   or at least a few months, it happened over a few weeks.
[00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:25.960]   It was like something out of all these financial history
[00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:27.440]   books you've been reading over the years,
[00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:29.600]   but you got to watch it in real life.
[00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:32.000]   As all of a sudden the nurses at the hospital
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:35.080]   and the housekeepers were talking about their Bitcoin
[00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:37.780]   and it went very rapidly up to, I don't know,
[00:55:37.780 --> 00:55:40.880]   20,000 of Bitcoin and then collapsed and lost,
[00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:43.520]   I don't know what it was, 75, 80% of its value
[00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:46.200]   over a matter of a couple of weeks.
[00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:48.880]   You know, I thought it was really fascinating to watch.
[00:55:48.880 --> 00:55:50.360]   I don't think it's a good investment.
[00:55:50.360 --> 00:55:52.720]   It doesn't have a place at all in my portfolio.
[00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:55.200]   It's entirely a speculative instrument.
[00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:58.280]   And I try to avoid putting serious money
[00:55:58.280 --> 00:56:00.240]   into speculative instruments like that.
[00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:04.720]   I like things that, you know, are actually productive assets
[00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:07.520]   like stocks in profitable companies
[00:56:07.520 --> 00:56:09.480]   and real estate that pays rent
[00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:14.320]   and interest-bearing investments like bonds, et cetera,
[00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:16.440]   rather than just pure speculative investments
[00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:20.000]   like gold and Bitcoin and beanie babies.
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:22.920]   And so it doesn't really have a place in my portfolio.
[00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:25.360]   - So we've got a big conference coming up
[00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:27.040]   and then also you've got an online course
[00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:28.280]   that people can take.
[00:56:28.280 --> 00:56:30.080]   I watched the preview, it looks very interesting.
[00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:31.840]   It's about the 12-step program.
[00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:33.960]   So just tell us a couple more of these other things
[00:56:33.960 --> 00:56:35.760]   that you're expanding into.
[00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:39.160]   - Sure, well, my idea is just to get this same information
[00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:40.800]   into whatever format people prefer.
[00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:42.880]   If they read blogs, that's great.
[00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:45.640]   If they like forums, you know, we've got a forum.
[00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:48.120]   If they like Facebook groups, we've got that.
[00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:51.200]   Podcast, if you like listening to podcasts, you name it.
[00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:54.080]   But the conference, this will be our second one.
[00:56:54.080 --> 00:56:55.760]   It's going to be in Las Vegas.
[00:56:55.760 --> 00:56:57.000]   And I thank you for being willing
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:58.680]   to come out and speak at it.
[00:56:58.680 --> 00:57:00.600]   We've got almost 800 people coming.
[00:57:00.600 --> 00:57:02.840]   Most of them are physicians and dentists.
[00:57:02.840 --> 00:57:04.720]   And it's called the Physician Wellness
[00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:06.800]   and Financial Literacy Conference.
[00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:09.360]   And it qualifies for some continuing
[00:57:09.360 --> 00:57:11.840]   medical education credit, mostly the wellness stuff,
[00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:13.760]   not so much the financial stuff.
[00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:16.160]   But it's a great three-day rendezvous
[00:57:16.160 --> 00:57:18.720]   where you can come and talk to people about money,
[00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:21.080]   a subject that maybe there's nobody else in your life
[00:57:21.080 --> 00:57:22.480]   that has a similar situation
[00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:24.600]   that you can talk to about money.
[00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:26.920]   You hear from some of the best speakers out there.
[00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:29.000]   We always have a sweet swag bag.
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:31.920]   Our swag bag this year has six or seven books in it.
[00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:35.480]   And so you leave with plenty to read on the plane home,
[00:57:35.480 --> 00:57:38.360]   which by itself would provide a fantastic education
[00:57:38.360 --> 00:57:40.960]   to an investor, even if you do nothing but show up,
[00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:43.160]   pick up the swag bag and read the books.
[00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:45.200]   And so we're excited for that.
[00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:47.560]   The other thing you asked about was the online course.
[00:57:47.560 --> 00:57:49.440]   And I came up with the online course
[00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:52.160]   because I found a need for people
[00:57:52.160 --> 00:57:54.800]   that wanted to be do-it-yourselfers,
[00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:57.680]   but weren't quite ready to do it.
[00:57:57.680 --> 00:58:01.640]   And so, you know, there wasn't a lot in the space
[00:58:01.640 --> 00:58:03.400]   between sending them to an advisor,
[00:58:03.400 --> 00:58:04.400]   a full service advisor,
[00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:06.560]   that might charge them several thousand dollars a year,
[00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:09.160]   versus telling them, go ask some questions on a forum
[00:58:09.160 --> 00:58:10.880]   and read some books at the library.
[00:58:10.880 --> 00:58:14.280]   But this, the idea here, is to help somebody
[00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:17.040]   put together a written investment plan by themselves
[00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:19.000]   that they understand and that they can follow.
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:20.640]   And so it takes them step-by-step
[00:58:20.640 --> 00:58:22.680]   through how to write a financial plan.
[00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:24.880]   And it's about eight hours of videos
[00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:28.320]   of my voice over screencasts,
[00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:30.240]   you know, slides and that sort of a thing.
[00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:31.920]   Each section has a quiz.
[00:58:31.920 --> 00:58:33.880]   There's a pre-exam and a post-exam
[00:58:33.880 --> 00:58:36.240]   to show you how much you learn during the time period.
[00:58:36.240 --> 00:58:38.160]   And the idea is that at the end,
[00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:41.120]   you come out with a written investing plan,
[00:58:41.120 --> 00:58:43.120]   a written financial plan for your student loans,
[00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:45.160]   your insurance, your investments, et cetera,
[00:58:45.160 --> 00:58:48.200]   that you can follow to investment success.
[00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:50.440]   I called it Fire Your Financial Advisor,
[00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:52.560]   which didn't make a lot of the financial advisors
[00:58:52.560 --> 00:58:54.280]   who advertise on my site happy.
[00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:57.880]   But the truth is, the whole first module
[00:58:57.880 --> 00:59:00.320]   is how to interact with a financial advisor.
[00:59:00.320 --> 00:59:03.120]   And a lot of people take that course and just say,
[00:59:03.120 --> 00:59:05.280]   you know what, this isn't for me,
[00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:07.760]   but now I'm much better prepared to select
[00:59:07.760 --> 00:59:09.920]   and work with my financial advisor.
[00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:11.320]   And I'm perfectly fine with that.
[00:59:11.320 --> 00:59:13.760]   I think that's a good use for the course as well.
[00:59:13.760 --> 00:59:15.960]   - Sounds like all great stuff, Jim.
[00:59:15.960 --> 00:59:18.360]   Thank you so much for your time today.
[00:59:18.360 --> 00:59:21.080]   And we're all looking forward to great things ahead.
[00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:22.720]   - Awesome, thank you for having me on.
[00:59:22.720 --> 00:59:24.880]   - This concludes the 19th episode
[00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:26.920]   of Bogleheads on Investing.
[00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:29.120]   I'm your host, Rick Ferry.
