[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.940]   We want to begin our hour today dealing with the role of the husband, God's design for
[00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.900]   husbands, and take a look at what the Bible has to say about that.
[00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.840]   So in order to get there, I want you to start by grabbing your Bible and let's go over to
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:33.400]   Genesis chapter 3 and we're interested in verse 16, Genesis 3 and verse 16.
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:43.280]   Of course we come into that infamous account of the fall and God's judgment upon mankind
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:51.100]   and his individual judgment upon the serpent and then Eve and then later Adam.
[00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:58.860]   Verse 16 is a description of the curse in relationship to the woman.
[00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:04.400]   He said to the woman, he said, "I would greatly multiply your pain," and then the next word
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:10.200]   is the preposition "in," I-N in the English.
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:18.280]   It actually in the Hebrew is "avav," which probably should be translated "and," and it
[00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:25.160]   would be more literally translated "your pain and childbirth," "in pain you shall bring
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:31.420]   forth children, yet your desire will be for your husband and he will rule over you."
[00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:38.240]   Now there has been a lot of commentary on this particular verse down through rabbinic
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.120]   as well as church history as to what this means.
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:47.160]   This last little phrase, "in pain you will bring forth children," or no, "yet your desire
[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.520]   shall be for your husband and he will rule over you," that little phrase.
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.240]   What is he talking about?
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.240]   What is God saying there?
[00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.460]   Well there's only one other time that we have in the entire book of Genesis that word for
[00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:13.120]   desire used and it's used in close proximity in terms of context and that's over in chapter
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.120]   4 and verse 7.
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:20.480]   The same term is used here and you remember the account, this is Cain and Cain is angry,
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:27.520]   he is also depressed as a result of God accepting his brother Abel's sacrifice and not his.
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:33.600]   God comes to him in verse 6 and says, "The Lord said to Cain, 'Why are you angry and
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.400]   why has your countenance fallen?'"
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:42.960]   I think that's a good Hebraic description of depression.
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:52.280]   Or at very least he is sullen and he is probably full of a lot of self-pity because God has
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.400]   not accepted his sacrifice.
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.640]   Then he says, now God gives Cain an opportunity to turn around here, "If you do well, will
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.400]   not your countenance be lifted up?"
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.360]   Which tells me, this is in a sense God's first instructions in dealing with, specifically
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:15.160]   with sin which tells us right from the very beginning that there is always joy in obedience.
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:21.520]   If you do well, if you do the right thing, if you obey me, there is going to be joy.
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.040]   If you don't, things are going to get worse.
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:29.280]   In fact he says, "And if you do not do well, sin is crouching at the door."
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:39.760]   So he sort of zoomorifies his sin, in other words he turns sin into like an animal that
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:46.760]   crouches at the door and when he walks through that door it jumps on him and overpowers him.
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:52.360]   So if you don't do not do well, sin is crouching at your door and it's desire, there's the
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:59.720]   word that's used back in 316, it's desire is for you but you must master it.
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.440]   Now we have a little bit better understanding within this context that in this particular
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:11.600]   case sin's desire was to control, manipulate, and dominate Cain.
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:18.280]   This is very deliberate, willful, what later on is called in the Old Testament high-handed
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:24.240]   sins, this is very willful, presumptuous sin, as David talks about in Psalm 19.
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:31.800]   So this kind of sin desires to control you or master you but you must master it.
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:40.640]   Now if that indeed, and I think it is, the understanding of this word, it's very similar
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:45.720]   back in 316, "Yet your desire," he says to the woman, "will be for your husband."
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:52.120]   The implication is like sin's desire was to control Cain, so her desire will be to control
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:57.720]   and manipulate her husband, to in a sense dominate him, that's going to be her natural
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:05.040]   desire of her heart, and then his natural desire will be to rule over her.
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:12.680]   Here the Hebrew word melech is the idea of to probably be heavy-handed in his rule over
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:19.000]   her, so now marriage becomes a struggle.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.080]   Marriage under the curse becomes a game of king of the hill.
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.400]   It becomes the battleground of the sexes.
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.000]   Who's going to win out?
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.560]   Whose will is going to win the day here?
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:39.480]   Her desire will be to control and manipulate her husband and his desire will be to rule
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.480]   over her.
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:46.720]   Sometimes when my wife does seminars and ladies' conferences and stuff like that, she'll talk
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:47.720]   about that.
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.880]   She says, "You know, I've never met a woman yet that I've ever counseled who didn't have
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:57.720]   some kind of an idea of the way that she really wanted her husband to turn out.
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:05.560]   She always has an idea of the way she wants her husband to be, and some women are more
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:11.320]   overt about getting their husbands to be that way, the way they think they ought to be.
[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:22.180]   Some women are more passive, resistive in their ability to be able to, or in their approach
[00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:27.520]   in trying to get their husband to be what they want him to be, but whatever the case,
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:34.480]   they go about taking steps in order to manipulate, control the situation.
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:44.920]   Sometimes they make threats, sometimes they promise things, and then many men then want
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:49.240]   to make sure they keep their wife under control.
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.280]   They want to rule over her, all right?
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:57.780]   And this is where you can see in the popular culture today, at least a cultural understanding
[00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:08.960]   of why the Bible is so misused by men to be oppressive to women in a marital situation,
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.860]   because they use the concept of submission that we'll talk about a little bit later,
[00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:23.080]   and they'll want to suppress a wife and keep her under his thumb, so to speak.
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:28.720]   So there is that struggle within marriage as a result of the curse.
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:33.940]   Now what's marvelous to me, sometimes when I talk about this with couples that are having
[00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:40.020]   marital problems, I'll describe this to help them understand that the Bible says this is
[00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:46.580]   a natural thing that will happen outside of Christ.
[00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:50.240]   But praise God for the Lord Jesus Christ, because he comes along, takes the sting of
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:58.020]   that curse away, and he actually instills within that husband a desire to lead his wife,
[00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:06.080]   but serve her and her needs first before his own, and that sting taken away in the wife's
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:16.680]   life constitutes her desire to now follow her husband and be a helpful complement to
[00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:25.280]   him instead of competing with him, instead of struggling with him.
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:33.540]   So in Christ now, the sting of that curse now is taken away.
[00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:39.400]   So marriage does not have to be a constant conflict, strife, or struggle.
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:44.080]   It doesn't have to be that way.
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:51.080]   And God has provided this in Christ.
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:53.560]   Now we'll talk about that a little bit later.
[00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:59.440]   But that sort of sets the tone for what I want to talk about here in terms of God's
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:03.340]   design for husbands.
[00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:10.300]   The first thing that we have to talk about is bring up the question, what is the nature
[00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:15.680]   of a man's leadership in the home?
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:20.720]   Because the Bible's definition of leadership and the world's definition of leadership are
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:22.000]   two different things.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.440]   In fact, if you were to go over to Matthew chapter 20, when Jesus is talking about the
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:40.460]   concept of leadership, we're interested in verse 25, Jesus called them to himself and
[00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:44.140]   said, "You know that the rulers, the Gentiles, lorded over them, and their great men exercised
[00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:47.140]   authority over them."
[00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:52.660]   Now that's the way the world views leadership, to exercise heavy-handed authority over a
[00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:53.660]   person.
[00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:55.460]   That's why some husbands do that.
[00:09:55.460 --> 00:10:00.160]   They think that that's what it means for a man to lead his household, that is to exercise
[00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:05.020]   heavy-handed authority over his wife.
[00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:08.480]   But Jesus says that's the way the world thinks.
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:13.400]   Verse 26, "It's not this way among you, but whoever wishes to be great among you must
[00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.080]   be your servant."
[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:18.480]   And the Greek term here is diakonos, all right?
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:23.360]   It's the word that, the derivative of that is the word where we get our word deacon from.
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.680]   All right?
[00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:35.120]   So real leadership from a biblical perspective is being like a deacon, a servant.
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:40.880]   Verse 27 says, "And whoever wishes to be first among you shall be your slave."
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:42.640]   Now he changes the term.
[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:49.800]   Here's the word doulos, "Just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:53.380]   and to give his life a ransom for many."
[00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:58.920]   So Christ came to be a diakonos and he came to be a doulos.
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:12.800]   He came to be a deacon, he came to be a slave, not just a servant, but to be a slave to others
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:13.800]   who have need.
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:18.200]   Now that's a radical definition of leadership.
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:22.560]   That's radically different from what the world says where a man thinks, "I've got to be the
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:23.720]   head of my home."
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:29.240]   He struggles to be the head of the home with his wife.
[00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:37.120]   And what he's really trying to do is just exercise raw power in leadership.
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:40.160]   But Jesus says, "That's not the way it is with my kingdom.
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:46.640]   That's not the way in which my gospel will go forward."
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:49.760]   What is it that God then expects of a husband?
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:54.080]   Well he expects them to lead through servanthood.
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:12:01.280]   Or another question, how is the husband's role really viewed in our society today?
[00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:06.960]   The home is under such a heavy attack from several different locations and there are
[00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:10.880]   a lot of men who can command a business and they command an organization.
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:17.700]   They can even command a church, but they've abrogated their throne of responsibility in
[00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:22.520]   leading their home.
[00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:26.840]   Now so what is the condition then of your home?
[00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:27.840]   That's a critical question.
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:32.000]   It's a good question for counselees that we work with.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:38.040]   Well the Bible says whether that man is leading or not, they and their family and their ministry
[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:45.320]   are hurting if they're not doing it God's way.
[00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:51.720]   Now what I usually do in counseling is I'll talk this through carefully with people, taking
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.080]   them to Scripture.
[00:12:53.080 --> 00:13:01.420]   But I want these men to learn three things, three terms, three English terms to help them
[00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:04.420]   remember their role as a godly husband.
[00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:09.020]   It's just something they can stick in the back pocket, so to speak, and pull out every
[00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:13.200]   now and then and say, "How am I doing?"
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:20.480]   The first term that we want to deal with is taken from 1 Peter 3 and verse 7.
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:29.160]   So if you have your Bible, let's go over there, 1 Peter 3, 7.
[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:36.380]   And here Peter is writing, the context here has to do with husbands who are married primarily
[00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:43.440]   to unbelieving wives, and these wives are bringing hardship into their life.
[00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:48.800]   They're causing quite a bit of suffering because as husbands they're the believers, the wives
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:51.640]   are not believers.
[00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:56.960]   But here in verse 7 he says, "You husbands, in the same way, live with your wives in an
[00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:00.440]   understanding way."
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:08.040]   So the first term I want them to understand is that a Christian husband is a learner.
[00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:11.880]   A Christian husband is a learner, and let me explain what I mean by that.
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:18.880]   The term that's used here, it's stated in the present tense, active participle here.
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:29.000]   In fact, it is a sun compound, sun oikonos, which means a husband has a responsibility
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:35.520]   to dwell together with his wife, and then the question is answered, how is he supposed
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:37.120]   to do that?
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:40.520]   And the next term is gnosis.
[00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:47.480]   Now it's translated in a lot of English translations as understanding, and it can be translated.
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:51.840]   That's a good literal translation of it, but I don't like that translation because of the
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:15:00.360]   way in which the contemporary English man views understanding.
[00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:05.440]   When they read that, I think that the typical English guy says, "Oh, I'm supposed to understand
[00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:06.440]   her.
[00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:10.180]   After all, she's a woman."
[00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:13.800]   Which is not the idea there at all.
[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:20.920]   The idea of gnosis, where by the way was derived later on in the first and second century to
[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:27.000]   describe the Gnostic movement, actually means to be knowledgeable.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.800]   The Gnostics believed they had a higher knowledge or some kind of mystical, special revelation
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:36.840]   from God or Jesus Christ that other people didn't have.
[00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:38.260]   So they had a knowledge.
[00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:42.680]   So it has to be, it means to be knowledgeable, gnosis.
[00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:50.500]   Conscious sensitivity, he is supposed to act in such a way that he is conscientiously sensitive
[00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:54.180]   to her and live with her in a knowledgeable way.
[00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:58.040]   By the way, that happens to be one of the main complaints that comes up in marital counseling
[00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:59.040]   all the time.
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:05.200]   If I've heard it, I've probably heard it a hundred times, and I'm not exaggerating.
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:10.480]   Where I hear a wife that says, "Listen, he's just not sensitive to what's going on in my
[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:11.480]   life."
[00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:16.660]   Well, the Bible says if you're going to be a good husband, you need to be.
[00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:22.500]   You have to dwell with her knowledgeably, is the idea.
[00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:29.020]   So that's very interesting because there is this attitude out there in the world, and
[00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:31.320]   the world says basically, "Who can understand women?"
[00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:34.600]   You can almost see them throw their hands up and they go, "Wow, women.
[00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:37.860]   I mean, they're emotional, they change.
[00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:41.840]   One day they act so logical, and the next day they act so emotional.
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:46.580]   One time in the month, they're really just off the planet somewhere out there in orbit.
[00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:49.980]   You can't get a fix on them.
[00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:51.300]   You just can't understand them.
[00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:56.100]   They're just out there."
[00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:58.960]   That's what the world says.
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:08.440]   But what this implies, according to what Peter is saying here, is that we're required to,
[00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:12.380]   and that's going to require time spent with your wife.
[00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:17.580]   You cannot know your wife without spending time with her, and, of course, the question
[00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:21.420]   always comes up in counseling, "Well, is that quality or quantity?"
[00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:23.060]   All right?
[00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:24.340]   I don't know.
[00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:32.980]   Some guys are real slow learners, so it's going to have to be quantity, all right?
[00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:38.460]   Whatever it takes to know your wife, that's the idea.
[00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:44.400]   By the way, I love the expression on the guy's face in our picture here, all right?
[00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:48.580]   Whatever it takes to know her, that's what you need to do.
[00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:52.580]   So it requires time spent with her.
[00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:57.860]   This also, this implication, says if we're going to really understand her, we're going
[00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:03.420]   to get a grasp on how did God uniquely create a woman?
[00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:12.560]   What is unique about their gender?
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:14.260]   Sometimes I like to illustrate it like this.
[00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:20.220]   Listen, guys, you did not grow up hearing stories about giving birth.
[00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:22.980]   She did.
[00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:26.580]   Some of the pleasures of that and some of the horror stories of that.
[00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:33.420]   That probably, when you were growing up, never crossed your mind.
[00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:38.840]   You didn't think about giving birth to a baby because you don't do that.
[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:40.500]   She does.
[00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:42.500]   She thinks about that.
[00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:48.260]   When she was a girl listening to older women talking about it, she sat there and soaked
[00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:57.180]   that all in and she heard the stories, the good stories and the bad stories and that's
[00:18:57.180 --> 00:19:01.680]   something that she carries with her in the back of her mind.
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:06.380]   You didn't have to grow up that way.
[00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:08.860]   You didn't have to grow up thinking about a monthly period.
[00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:12.740]   You didn't have to grow up doing that.
[00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:13.740]   She does.
[00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:18.860]   There's a time of the month that she just doesn't feel good and for some girls it's
[00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:22.500]   worse than others.
[00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:25.440]   That's the way God created them.
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:33.700]   They have to go through that particular type of a struggle on a regular basis.
[00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:39.820]   That's something that is totally outside your sphere of experience.
[00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:43.300]   You don't have to do that.
[00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:44.900]   How did God create women?
[00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:51.660]   What is unique about their gender?
[00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:55.340]   My daughter, right at this particular point, is within a few days of giving birth to our
[00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:58.860]   second grandchild.
[00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:06.800]   Her name is going to be, they know it's a little girl, Felicity Sophia Arns.
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:15.120]   So we're looking forward to that happening and my daughter is looking extremely pregnant.
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:22.200]   And one of her biggest concerns when she just had her doctor's appointment yesterday was
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:24.680]   I'm afraid this baby's too big.
[00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:28.240]   Is it too big, doctor?
[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:33.920]   Now as a guy, you probably wouldn't give a second thought to that.
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:37.440]   It's a big baby, so what?
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:45.480]   Yeah well, you don't have to bring that thing into the world, all right?
[00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:48.800]   So that's a concern on her part.
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:49.800]   Is this thing too big?
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:51.840]   No, it's not too big.
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:56.080]   Looks fine, you look fine, you're going to do well.
[00:20:56.080 --> 00:21:00.440]   This is her first baby, she's never had this experience before, you know, this is going
[00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:10.080]   to be an interesting process to go through for her, so all that's going to happen.
[00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:11.200]   How did God create women?
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:12.760]   What's unique about their gender?
[00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:13.880]   What about your wife?
[00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:18.280]   What is unique and special about your wife?
[00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:22.560]   You know, every woman has certain strengths and certain weaknesses just like every man
[00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:23.980]   does.
[00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:26.160]   What is unique about your wife?
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:35.200]   How well do you know her strengths and her weaknesses?
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:40.560]   There are some women who are very good musicians.
[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:47.440]   Other women who could care less about musical things or artsy things, they would rather
[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:57.760]   get out and mow the lawn and plant flowers and take care of the cattle.
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:05.600]   They'd rather do that, you know, be out there and that's their longing, that's their interest,
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:06.880]   that's what they like.
[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:09.480]   What's unique about your wife?
[00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:10.660]   What's special about her?
[00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:17.580]   What makes her different than the other women around her?
[00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:20.480]   Or what is the particular load that your wife bears?
[00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:26.760]   What is unique in her struggles in life and how is she different in this way?
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:33.700]   Some women have grown up in homes where maybe a father or mother or brothers or sisters
[00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:44.900]   or aunts or uncles have abused them physically or sexually.
[00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:50.660]   Just a few years ago, I sat down with an international pastor and he and his wife were going through
[00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:56.020]   some difficult times, he had a pretty challenging ministry where he was at, and we spent time
[00:22:56.020 --> 00:23:04.860]   talking about events that had occurred in his wife's life years before when she was
[00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:11.620]   a girl growing up on how she had been sexually abused by people in her past.
[00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:14.500]   Did that have an effect upon their marriage?
[00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:16.580]   Absolutely did.
[00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:21.780]   It was still something that she carried with her right into that marriage.
[00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:27.780]   So when the Bible talks about living knowledgeably with your wife, it talks about getting to
[00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:32.580]   know some of the unique challenges that she has.
[00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:39.620]   There are certain types of problems that women will have, like endometriosis, that as men
[00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:47.280]   we don't usually have any problems with that, but they'll have problems with that.
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:49.180]   How is your wife different?
[00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:51.620]   Does she have a physical problem?
[00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:54.740]   Is it because of her history and her background?
[00:23:54.740 --> 00:24:00.540]   Maybe she comes from a home that's not a believing home, mother or father, we're not believers,
[00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:07.860]   or maybe she comes from a divorced home where mom and dad were divorced, and she wonders
[00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:13.380]   in the back of her mind, "Is this gonna happen to me again in my own home?
[00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:15.620]   Is this something that will occur here?"
[00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:19.580]   That could have an effect upon how she views life.
[00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:21.900]   So how is she different in this way?
[00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:28.260]   What is it that makes your wife really unique?
[00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:29.260]   All of that is key.
[00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:32.560]   Now, notice, let's go back to 1 Peter 3, 7.
[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:39.740]   He says, "We're supposed to dwell with them," and I would rather translate it in a knowledgeable
[00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:45.820]   way instead of an understanding way, in a knowledgeable way, "as with someone weaker
[00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:47.420]   since she is a woman."
[00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:51.660]   Now, he's not saying that negatively.
[00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:54.380]   I think our culture today would read that negatively.
[00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:56.780]   Well, she's weaker because she's a woman.
[00:24:56.780 --> 00:24:58.340]   That's the way it would be read.
[00:24:58.340 --> 00:24:59.740]   It's not what he's saying.
[00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:08.380]   In fact, the word weaker is a word that actually could be translated delicate, okay?
[00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:15.900]   It's the same word that was used oftentimes of delicate piece of fine pottery that was
[00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:18.860]   handmade or hand-crafted.
[00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:24.100]   If you go to Israel and you walk around Israel, almost everywhere you go, there's broken pieces
[00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:27.820]   of pottery all over the place.
[00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:33.700]   You can pick them up and see them that have just been there for centuries upon centuries.
[00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:36.340]   Delicate pieces of fine pottery.
[00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:37.340]   Since she is a woman.
[00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:38.340]   That's not a negative statement.
[00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:39.340]   That's a positive statement.
[00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:43.860]   After all, Eve was the crowning point of creation.
[00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:51.420]   Not until Eve was created did God then call creation not just good but very good.
[00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:53.820]   Crowning point.
[00:25:53.820 --> 00:26:06.340]   So you're supposed to treat her with respect like a weaker vessel, like a delicate vessel.
[00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:07.540]   And it doesn't necessarily...
[00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:10.980]   I don't believe that this word means that she's physically weaker.
[00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:14.860]   You may be able to argue that, that generally males tend to be a little bit bigger, a little
[00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:15.860]   bit stronger.
[00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:17.540]   Generally, that may be true.
[00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:19.240]   But that's not what he's saying here.
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:24.080]   What he is saying here is you're supposed to treat her as...
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:27.340]   You know, there are some women who work out, all right?
[00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:30.340]   And they can lift some pretty good weights.
[00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:35.740]   You know, they're not little daisies, delicate daisies.
[00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:38.860]   But whether or not she's that way or not, that's not the issue.
[00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:43.580]   You're supposed to treat her as you would a delicate piece of fine china, like that.
[00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:48.240]   A lot of men treat their wives like Tupperware, all right?
[00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:53.860]   Not like fine china.
[00:26:53.860 --> 00:27:00.840]   Let's say, for instance, you went down to Kmart and on one of their blue light specials,
[00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:07.460]   you bought a piece of china, maybe a flower vase.
[00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:09.380]   And you paid 25 bucks for it.
[00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:13.560]   It looked really pretty, something to go with your house.
[00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:18.340]   You'd probably check it out, pay for it, throw it in one of those little plastic bags and
[00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:22.620]   take it out the car, pitch it in the back, take it home, put it up on the mantle there
[00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:27.860]   in your house, put some dried flowers in it, occasionally dust it off and comment how pretty
[00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:31.540]   that thing is.
[00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:41.020]   But let's say, for instance, you inherited a 5th century Ming vase worth millions, millions.
[00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:42.020]   What would you do with it?
[00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:47.460]   I know some of you guys are saying you'd sell it and it ruins my whole illustration.
[00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:51.660]   All right, no.
[00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:53.300]   What would you do with that?
[00:27:53.300 --> 00:28:00.500]   You'd probably hire brink security to go pick this thing up in an atmospherically controlled
[00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:07.620]   vault, made sure that this thing was strapped down during transport on a very soft cushioned
[00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:14.620]   pillow, not exposed to too much light or radiation out there in the sun so it doesn't fade it
[00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:15.620]   at all.
[00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:18.340]   You don't want to lose any value at all.
[00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:22.260]   Well, that's the idea here.
[00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:25.540]   She is your 5th century Ming vase.
[00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:34.320]   You are to treat her as a delicate vase, which means to honor her, respect her, cherish her
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:38.260]   as you would an expensive piece of fine china.
[00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:43.580]   She is to be treated with utmost value.
[00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:47.520]   That's the implication.
[00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:55.760]   And what even magnifies this even more is the next little phrase in the verse because
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:29:00.200]   it says, "And show her honor as a fellow heir of the grace of life."
[00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:04.480]   That little word "as" is a very important word in our verse because in this particular
[00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:12.080]   case within the context and the flow of the argument, this woman is not a believer.
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:21.000]   So he is saying you treat her, even if she's not a believer, as you would a believing wife.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:25.960]   The same way, no different.
[00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:33.400]   Just because you're married to an unbeliever does not change this one iota.
[00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:37.400]   So that your prayers may not be hindered.
[00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:46.140]   In other words, you learning her affects your spiritual life.
[00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:48.680]   You think your prayers aren't getting any higher than the ceiling?
[00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:51.840]   Then you need to check your relationship to your wife.
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:54.560]   How are you treating your wife?
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:58.840]   This really essentially says her problems become your problems.
[00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:00.920]   Godly husbands do not say, "Well, she made the mess.
[00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:03.400]   She'll just have to take care of it herself."
[00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:07.760]   Godly husbands don't say that.
[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:09.680]   No.
[00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:16.920]   So that nothing, nothing hinders your prayers.
[00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:20.840]   You know, not all of my problems are my wife's problems.
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:22.480]   But you know what?
[00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:27.840]   Every single one of her problems are my problems.
[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:28.840]   Every single one.
[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:31.000]   There's nothing that she has.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.040]   There's nothing.
[00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:33.560]   Nothing that she does.
[00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:40.000]   There's no difficulty that she encounters that's not my problem.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:46.680]   Because I'm responsible before God for her.
[00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:49.160]   That's pretty heavy.
[00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:52.600]   First thing you got to remember in order to be a godly husband is be a learner.
[00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:55.120]   Second thing you got to remember in order to be a godly husband.
[00:30:55.120 --> 00:31:00.040]   Let's go over to Ephesians chapter 5 and verse 25.
[00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:03.480]   Ephesians 5, verse 25.
[00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:07.800]   Again, this is just a little memory device.
[00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:10.960]   In order to be a godly husband, you got to be a lover.
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:16.720]   Verse 25 of Ephesians 5 says this, "Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:22.560]   the church and gave himself up for her."
[00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:29.880]   Now the question comes, how is it that a man is to have, or what is really the love that
[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:33.400]   it is that a man is to have for a woman?
[00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:39.040]   Because our American European culture does not help us here at all.
[00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:44.160]   The popular view of a man's love for a woman really is a macho sexual conquest type of
[00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:45.160]   a love.
[00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:48.200]   I'll show her I love her, grab her hand and drag her to bed.
[00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:51.880]   That's the way I show her that I love her.
[00:31:51.880 --> 00:32:00.480]   Well, anyone can take from a woman, but that is not biblical love.
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:05.120]   Biblical love is always defined as giving.
[00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:12.120]   That's true in John 3, 16, "For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son."
[00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:17.140]   Galatians 2, 20, "Christ loved us and gave himself up for us."
[00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:25.320]   Here in Ephesians 5, 25, he says, "Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved
[00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:29.120]   the church and gave himself up for her."
[00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:35.440]   So every time you see this concept of love in the New Testament, it's usually associated
[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:40.040]   with this action verb, to give.
[00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:42.480]   There's a giving.
[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:51.560]   But this macho sexual conquest thing is nothing but taking.
[00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:52.560]   Anybody can take.
[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:57.120]   Biblical love is really giving, and biblical love, I think, then is the real test of masculinity.
[00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:00.280]   It's not a test of masculinity to take sex from somebody.
[00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:07.960]   It is a test of masculinity to give, to give without expecting anything in return.
[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:13.280]   God-like love gives, and the more that a husband understands that, the more his wife's heart
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:20.460]   wants to respond to him in the right way.
[00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:25.040]   So in order to be a godly husband, first, you've got to be a learner, but secondly,
[00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:28.520]   you've got to be a Christ-like lover.
[00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:38.680]   Now, oftentimes in counseling, the question comes, "How far does this go?
[00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:46.240]   What is the degree of love that I am supposed to show as a husband to my wife?"
[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:55.320]   Well, you'll notice here in Ephesians 5, 25, he says, "We are to love as Christ loved."
[00:33:55.320 --> 00:34:01.040]   So whatever example he demonstrates for us becomes our example.
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:03.640]   And there's at least three things that we can say about that.
[00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:08.280]   One is, we know that 1 John 4, 19, Christ loved us first.
[00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:10.420]   We love him because he first loved us.
[00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:17.440]   So it's not her responsibility to initiate love in the home.
[00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:19.560]   Sometimes I'll have husbands do that to me.
[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:23.440]   They'll come in and they'll sit down in counseling, and they'll say, "There's no love in our home,"
[00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:27.800]   and then they'll look scathingly at their wife, and I want to put a mirror in front
[00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:32.000]   of them and have them read 1 John 4, 19 and say, "Why?"
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.560]   Because it's your responsibility to initiate love.
[00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:37.420]   If you're going to love as Christ loved, then he loved first.
[00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:40.480]   So you're the one who should initiate love in the home.
[00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:42.960]   It's not her responsibility to do that.
[00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:44.520]   It's your responsibility.
[00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:48.680]   We love him because he first loved us.
[00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:52.400]   If we're going to love like Christ, then we initiate that love.
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:54.560]   She doesn't initiate it.
[00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:57.400]   So we love first.
[00:34:57.400 --> 00:35:02.400]   Then it says there in Ephesians 5, 25, that he loved most.
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:07.160]   He gave himself up for her, that is, for the church.
[00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:09.220]   So he loved most.
[00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:14.040]   It is a type of love that is totally giving.
[00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:17.920]   And then 1 John 3, 18, "Let us not love in word, neither in tongue, but in deed and in
[00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:18.920]   truth."
[00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:23.880]   So he loved unmistakably.
[00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:26.600]   He loved first, most, and unmistakably.
[00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:30.480]   That's the kind of love that we not just tell our wives that we love them.
[00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:34.800]   We need to show it through what we do.
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:41.280]   Now let's go back to Ephesians 5 and skip down just a few verses to verse 28, where
[00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:48.200]   it says, "So husbands ought also to love their own wives as their own body."
[00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:51.480]   That's a critical verse.
[00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:53.040]   So how are we to love?
[00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:59.980]   We're to love as Christ loved, but we're also to love as our own bodies, Ephesians 5, 28.
[00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:04.840]   Here if husbands love their wives as much as they love themselves, they'd have great
[00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:05.840]   marriages.
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:12.880]   The assumption here at this particular point is that men already love themselves a lot.
[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:13.880]   They do.
[00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:15.640]   I mean, you think about it.
[00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:18.960]   When your husband's thirsty, what does he do?
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:19.960]   He goes get something to drink.
[00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:21.880]   When he's hungry, he gets something to eat.
[00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:25.420]   When he's hurt, he goes get something to bandage up the hurt.
[00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:27.680]   When he's tired, he goes to bed.
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:29.960]   He looks out for himself very well.
[00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:32.320]   That's his default nature.
[00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:39.580]   Now if he looked out for his wife with the same degree of passion and love that he looked
[00:36:39.580 --> 00:36:44.800]   out for himself, then he'd have a great marriage.
[00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:53.960]   So we're to love as, not just as Christ loved, but we're to love as our own bodies.
[00:36:53.960 --> 00:37:05.920]   No one ever yet, he says, hated his own body, verse 29, but nourishes it and cherishes it
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:09.140]   just as Christ does the church.
[00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:13.240]   Now that doesn't mean we don't dislike certain aspects of our body.
[00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:19.560]   You know, sometimes you'll get people that'll come in for counseling and I can remember
[00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:30.080]   back a few years ago I was sitting in my office and I had a young lady come in and she was
[00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:31.080]   really depressed.
[00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:32.080]   In fact, I think I shared this.
[00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:33.080]   Did I share this illustration with you?
[00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:38.320]   I don't know whether I did or not, but she was really depressed and so she sat down and
[00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:42.080]   I said, "What's wrong?" and she says, "I just hate myself."
[00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:47.080]   And I said, "You do?
[00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:48.080]   Are you depressed?"
[00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:49.080]   "Yeah."
[00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:50.080]   "Are you miserable?"
[00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:51.080]   "Mm-hmm."
[00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:58.280]   "Well, tell me why you hate yourself."
[00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:01.000]   And usually when you ask that question, you'll get a whole litany of answers.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.800]   I'm too tall, too short, too fat, too skinny.
[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:11.480]   I'm not athletic enough or I'm not academic enough or I'm not musical enough or whatever.
[00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:15.280]   And you could add to it.
[00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:18.560]   And eventually after I listened to her for a while, I said to her, I said, "Now I'm really
[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:19.560]   confused.
[00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:20.560]   You've got to help me."
[00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:22.200]   She says, "What are you confused about?"
[00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:28.640]   I said, "You came in and told me that you hated yourself, that you were depressed, that
[00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:33.560]   you were miserable.
[00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:36.200]   That doesn't make any sense to me."
[00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:38.520]   "Well, why not?"
[00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:44.880]   "Well, because if you really hated yourself," if that were the case, if you really hated
[00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:51.320]   self, you'd be happy you were weird and different because you'd say, "Ah, that's just the way
[00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:52.320]   I am.
[00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:53.320]   I hate myself anyhow.
[00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:56.320]   That's just me.
[00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:57.320]   I'm weird.
[00:38:57.320 --> 00:39:00.160]   I'm too tall, too short, too fat, too skinny.
[00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:01.160]   I have a crooked nose.
[00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:03.840]   I have big ears.
[00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:08.520]   So that's just me."
[00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:14.600]   But the very fact that you're depressed and miserable tells me that deep down in your
[00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:17.880]   heart, you really love yourself an awful lot.
[00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:22.840]   And because this is different on the outside, that's what makes you miserable.
[00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:28.000]   And the tears started to flow.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:32.060]   And she says, "Nobody's ever said that to me before."
[00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:34.440]   I said, "Well, that's what the Bible says."
[00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:43.720]   So I took her over to passages like this and over in Matthew 22.
[00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:49.980]   And the next hour, I had lunch there in the college cafeteria.
[00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:54.200]   And she had lunch at the same time, and I was watching her go through the salad line.
[00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:58.040]   And she came up to this big bowl of red cherry tomatoes, and she was rifling through the
[00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:02.480]   red cherry tomatoes and picking one up, looking at it for a little bit, and then putting it
[00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:05.200]   back, picking one up, looking at it, putting it back.
[00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:10.180]   And I thought to myself as I sat there and watched her, "What is she doing?
[00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:11.760]   I know what she's doing.
[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:14.120]   She hates herself.
[00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:18.160]   So she's looking for the worst tomatoes in the entire bunch.
[00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:21.320]   That's what she's doing because she innately hates herself."
[00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:25.600]   Well, you know as well as I do, that's not what was going on.
[00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:26.880]   No, no, no.
[00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:32.160]   She was picking out the reddest, ripest, most perfect cherry tomatoes she could find in
[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:35.520]   that whole salad bowl to put on her salad.
[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:36.520]   Why?
[00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:42.480]   Because her default nature was to look out for herself first.
[00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:45.600]   That was her innate love of self.
[00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:48.720]   Same thing is true with husbands.
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:53.040]   You come to our house, and you'll see in the middle of the dining room table, which my
[00:40:53.040 --> 00:41:00.320]   wife usually has a bowl that has bananas in it or oranges or apples, and we'll have college
[00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:04.280]   students over all the time, and they'll grab an apple, and they'll pick it up, twirl it
[00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:07.000]   around a little bit, put it back, get another one, twirl it around a little bit, put it
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   back.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   What are they doing?
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.440]   They're looking for the worst one in the bunch because people innately hate themselves.
[00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:13.640]   No they don't.
[00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:18.680]   They're looking for the best one in the bunch, the one with the least bruises on it so that
[00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:25.120]   they can eat it, and it tastes good, and it's not going to be sour, and well, that's the
[00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:28.280]   way people are, default nature.
[00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:33.280]   That's the assumption that Paul makes here.
[00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:37.400]   Husbands are to love their wives as their own bodies, so if a husband loved his wife
[00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:44.360]   as much as they already loved themselves, then they'd have great marriages.
[00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:48.920]   They looked out for themselves.
[00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:51.320]   In fact, one last thing.
[00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:59.280]   Notice this, thirdly, that this is the thing that overcomes bitterness, Colossians 3.19.
[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:02.920]   Husbands love your wives and do not be embittered against them.
[00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:09.000]   You look at this in the original language, and it's very clear that it's impossible to
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:14.120]   maintain and hold on to your bitterness because sometimes I'll have wives say to me, "You
[00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:15.640]   don't understand my wife.
[00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:17.620]   You don't understand what she's done.
[00:42:17.620 --> 00:42:19.800]   You don't understand what's happened in our marriage.
[00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:22.240]   You don't understand what a wicked tongue she has.
[00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:25.000]   She can slice you and dice you with her tongue.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:26.480]   You don't understand my wife."
[00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:32.640]   I don't care how bitter you are, if you are practicing Christ-like love, it will be impossible
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:36.280]   for you to hold on to your bitterness.
[00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:39.680]   That's going to be impossibility.
[00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:48.100]   So it's this kind of love that overcomes bitterness.
[00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:51.700]   So in order to be a godly husband, number one, first you've got to be a learner.
[00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:53.600]   Number two, you've got to be a Christ-like lover.
[00:42:53.600 --> 00:43:02.320]   Number three, Ephesians 5, 23 through 25, you've got to be a godly leader.
[00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:06.920]   Now what leadership is not?
[00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:08.860]   A godly leader is not a dictator.
[00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:12.360]   We already saw that in Matthew 20, 25 through 28.
[00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:18.560]   Instead he's a diakonos, he's a doulos, he's a servant, or a slave really, and a deacon.
[00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:21.440]   He's a slave and a deacon.
[00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:24.560]   A godly leader is not a dominator.
[00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:28.640]   Too many men think that they must make all the decisions in their marriage.
[00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:29.640]   No.
[00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:34.960]   God gave his wife certain gifts and talents and a mind, and he's a fool if he doesn't
[00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:39.200]   use those abilities and gifts and talents.
[00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:41.800]   And a godly leader is not demanding.
[00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:44.360]   He's not demanding.
[00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:50.200]   In other words, he doesn't force her to submit.
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:54.480]   Nowhere in the Bible does it say, "Husbands, make sure your wives submit."
[00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:58.160]   It doesn't say that anywhere in the Bible.
[00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:01.000]   It's wives, submit yourselves into your husbands.
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:04.560]   It's a decision that she has to make, and by the way, there's no husband on the planet,
[00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:08.560]   I don't care how big and strong he might be, that can force a wife to submit, no matter
[00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:10.800]   how small and delicate she may be.
[00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:12.200]   You know why?
[00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:14.640]   Because submission has to do with an attitude of the heart.
[00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:18.540]   It has to do with an attitude of the heart.
[00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:24.120]   You may get your wife to obey because you're big and strong, but you can't make her submit.
[00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:27.640]   It's kind of like the little boy that got in trouble with his mother, and his mother
[00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:28.640]   set him in the corner.
[00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:33.920]   A little bit later on, she came back and looked at him, and he turned around and looked at
[00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:38.840]   her and he said, "Mom, on the outside, I'm sitting down, but on the inside, I'm standing
[00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:41.640]   up."
[00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:43.080]   He had obeyed, right?
[00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:44.080]   Had he submitted?
[00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:46.680]   No, he had not.
[00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:48.280]   He had not submitted.
[00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:53.400]   So there's not, I don't care how big, strong you can be, you can't force a wife to submit.
[00:44:53.400 --> 00:45:01.380]   Nowhere, this is a decision that she has to make before God in her own walk with the Lord
[00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:04.520]   for her to be submissive to you.
[00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:06.520]   Well, what is it?
[00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:07.880]   Well, godly leadership.
[00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:10.360]   I love the description in John 10, 27.
[00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:13.700]   I think this is a great description.
[00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:15.960]   Godly leadership.
[00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:18.600]   Jesus says, "My sheep hear my voice and they," what?
[00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:21.080]   "They follow me," right?
[00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:23.900]   That's a great definition of leadership.
[00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:28.420]   My sheep hear my voice and they follow me.
[00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:31.640]   Jesus didn't drive the sheep with a bullwhip.
[00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:32.640]   You can't drive sheep.
[00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:35.120]   It's like herding cats.
[00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:36.120]   You can't do it.
[00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:38.160]   They'll just scatter all over the place.
[00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:41.080]   You can't drive sheep with a bullwhip, but you can lead them.
[00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:46.340]   You can get out in front of them and by the example of your life, and then they follow.
[00:45:46.340 --> 00:45:47.740]   That's godly leadership.
[00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:53.400]   That's what Jesus did as a shepherd.
[00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:56.840]   So if you're going to set an example, what kind of example are you going to set?
[00:45:56.840 --> 00:46:00.600]   Well, a godly leader focuses on needs, the needs of others.
[00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:03.400]   That's what a husband should do.
[00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:08.460]   He sets the tone for that home, for that marriage by focusing on the needs of others.
[00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:15.320]   His goal, he is also goal-oriented and he needs to set godly goals.
[00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:16.480]   So where are you leading your family?
[00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:22.560]   Where do you want your family to be in five years or 10 years or 15 years?
[00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:29.400]   He also sets examples of control in every area of his life, like Job set for his children
[00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:35.640]   in Job chapter 1, where he went out and offered sacrifices just in case his children had sinned
[00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:36.640]   the night before.
[00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:41.440]   That's setting an example of godliness.
[00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:43.800]   So how much television do you watch?
[00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:45.840]   What kind of television do you watch?
[00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:46.840]   What kind of books do you read?
[00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:51.280]   Where do you go on the internet?
[00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:54.040]   How much sleep do you get?
[00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:58.600]   How much time do you spend with the family, not being consumed by things at work?
[00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:01.360]   There's a host of things, setting examples of control.
[00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:02.600]   How much do you eat?
[00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:03.600]   What do you eat?
[00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:06.320]   Do you eat the proper kind of food?
[00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:08.320]   You're setting examples for your wife and for your family.
[00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:09.320]   Jeff?
[00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:10.320]   >> Go back to number two, he's goal-oriented.
[00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:11.320]   What do you do?
[00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:12.320]   You're counseling a family where the husband has a lot of goals, but yet the decision or
[00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:27.560]   the goal might not be the wisest, like moving to a new area or something.
[00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:32.960]   >> Well, when we're talking about goals here, we're talking primarily spiritual goals.
[00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:43.400]   Those things override and set the stage for all of the intermediate goals.
[00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:48.600]   Intermediate goals may be like moving from one house or one location to another location,
[00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:53.680]   but how is that servicing the overall spiritual goals of the family?
[00:47:53.680 --> 00:48:02.320]   And so you can determine the value of a wise or unwise move if you have broader spiritual
[00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:07.920]   goals that will help them if you're counseling a person like that.
[00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:13.000]   That's really quite a good question.
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:18.320]   Number four, I think being a godly leader means also that he's a problem solver.
[00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:20.760]   She can turn to him for help.
[00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:24.040]   He may not be able to solve every problem, that's not the point.
[00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:32.920]   The fact that she knows that she can turn to him in order to receive help is all that's
[00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:33.920]   needed.
[00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:39.200]   Now, it does help if he's able to solve some problems.
[00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:42.120]   Furthermore, he's also a teacher.
[00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:44.040]   He leads her in the word.
[00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:47.620]   He leads his family in the word.
[00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:48.960]   So where are you leading your family?
[00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:53.960]   Where do you want your family to be?
[00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:58.680]   And then sixth, he's also a joy to live with.
[00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:00.440]   That's what a godly leader is.
[00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:01.440]   He's a joy to live with.
[00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:05.360]   You know, I've always wanted, even when I was a pastor for many years, I never wanted
[00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:09.680]   to bring the problems at church home with me.
[00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:18.480]   And when I walked in the door, I wanted my kids to see, to look forward to that time
[00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:23.200]   because I think I counseled so many families where the kids and the wife dreaded when dad
[00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:24.200]   got home.
[00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:26.880]   "Dad's going to be home in 10 minutes.
[00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:27.880]   Everybody run for cover."
[00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:29.640]   All right.
[00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:33.720]   They're diving underneath the bed, you know, "Yeah."
[00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:35.760]   Dad comes in and he's a grouch.
[00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:37.720]   He's going to bite everybody's head off.
[00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:40.600]   No, I didn't want that.
[00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:43.200]   I wanted them to say, "You know what?
[00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:46.760]   10 minutes, dad's going to be home.
[00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:50.580]   Best time of the day.
[00:49:50.580 --> 00:49:53.120]   This is what I look forward to.
[00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:54.120]   He's coming home."
[00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:55.120]   Okay.
[00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:59.000]   And you walk in the door, I don't care how many problems or what the problems have been
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.480]   at work, you walk in the door, you're positive.
[00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:10.440]   That doesn't mean that you're, you know, off the wall crazy, but you're positive and it's
[00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:13.000]   a joy to see them.
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:15.120]   You're a joy to live with.
[00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:16.120]   So what do we got?
[00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:20.560]   We got three things that are key, little memory devices you can stick in the back pocket in
[00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:23.520]   order to remember how to be godly husbands.
[00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:25.080]   The first thing is learner.
[00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:27.280]   The second thing is lover.
[00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:29.960]   And the third is leader.
[00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:31.160]   Now I've been teaching these for years.
[00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:35.040]   I mean, it's several years ago, this must have been 25 years ago, I was doing a wedding
[00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:44.880]   and I did the premarital counseling of a couple.
[00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:50.280]   And this particular couple, Tim and Brenda.
[00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:54.320]   I was trying to think of their name, Tim and Brenda.
[00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:58.480]   I did their premarital counseling and I said, "Okay, Tim, on the day of the wedding, I'm
[00:50:58.480 --> 00:51:01.600]   gonna ask you what are the three things you need to remember in order to be a godly husband
[00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:04.440]   and I want you to repeat them for me and tell me what they mean."
[00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:06.440]   He says, "Pastor, I'll be there.
[00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:07.440]   I will be ready."
[00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:12.080]   The day of the wedding showed up, I usually go in and have prayer with the bride and her
[00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:17.760]   family and all the bridesmaids, then I go over and have prayer with the groom and all
[00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:23.360]   the groomsmen and his family and right in the middle of that group, I say to Tim, "Tim,
[00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:26.640]   there's three things you gotta remember in order to be a godly husband to Brenda.
[00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:27.640]   What is it?"
[00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:35.240]   He says, "I've got 'em, Pastor, learner, lover, lever."
[00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:37.480]   Everybody cracked up.
[00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:38.720]   I said, "This wedding's off."
[00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:44.880]   And then he smiled and he says, "No, learner, lover, leader."
[00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:46.560]   I said, "Do you understand what those mean?"
[00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:47.560]   He says, "Yes."
[00:51:47.560 --> 00:51:48.880]   And I said, "Explain 'em to me."
[00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:51.680]   Okay, and he went ahead and explained those three things.
[00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:55.320]   Learner, lover, leader, not lever.
[00:51:55.320 --> 00:51:56.960]   Leader.
[00:51:56.960 --> 00:51:57.960]   That's a key thing.
[00:51:57.960 --> 00:52:03.120]   And I always tell that story because somehow it cements those concepts in a male's mind,
[00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:04.120]   but it does.
[00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:08.200]   Learner, lover, and then they always get this smile, leader.
[00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:15.760]   Alright, let's come back to the wife's role and take a look at it now.
[00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:17.360]   We've talked about the husband's role.
[00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:22.300]   In order to be a godly husband, you've gotta be a learner, lover, and leader, those three
[00:52:22.300 --> 00:52:23.300]   key things.
[00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:26.840]   And we have three things for the wife as well.
[00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:30.880]   What really is God's design for wives?
[00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:36.920]   And as we get into this, this is a little helpful illustration, pick this up in a little
[00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:37.920]   comic strip.
[00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:42.240]   Here's an illustration of what some wives really think of their husbands.
[00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:48.040]   The counselor here says, "Now, when we last met, I asked each of you to bring a list of
[00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:51.920]   things that your spouse does that really annoy you."
[00:52:51.920 --> 00:53:02.240]   Okay, now notice, the husband has a little, teeny sticky note there, and she has this
[00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:05.240]   pile of things.
[00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:11.720]   Alright, what are the things that your spouse does that really annoy you, the counselor
[00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:12.720]   says.
[00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:19.720]   Well, and the reason why I like that particular comic strip is something very similar to that
[00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:24.080]   happened to me, only I had not given it as an assignment.
[00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:29.240]   I had actually met with this couple for the first time, and I found out that they were
[00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:32.600]   having marital problems, and that's the reason why they were coming to counseling.
[00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:38.680]   And I had prayer with them, and after the prayer, I looked at the couple, and I said,
[00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:43.000]   "Alright, tell me the reasons why you're here, tell me why you believe that you have come
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:46.960]   in to receive some biblical help and counsel."
[00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:51.640]   And I barely got those words out of my mouth when she had reached down into her little
[00:53:51.640 --> 00:54:00.120]   satchel that she had brought with her, and pulled out what looked like a ream of paper.
[00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:05.560]   It was about that thick, and she laid it down in front of me, and she pointed to it, and
[00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:11.880]   she said, "This is the reason why we're having problems in our marriage."
[00:54:11.880 --> 00:54:18.080]   And I looked at it, and I started rifling through the papers, and I realized that this
[00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:25.320]   was a record that she had kept of every wrong thing her husband had ever done in their seven
[00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:29.000]   or eight years of marriage.
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:34.320]   And it was a ream, single-spaced, alright?
[00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:37.840]   She had kept a record of every wrong thing.
[00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:41.360]   And I looked up at her, and I said, "Wow, you're right.
[00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:45.680]   This is one of the reasons why you're having serious problems in your marriage."
[00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:51.280]   And she kind of smiled like I agreed with her, you know, and only I meant it in an entirely
[00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:54.160]   different way than what she meant it.
[00:54:54.160 --> 00:54:58.280]   And I said to her, "By the way, do you love your husband?"
[00:54:58.280 --> 00:54:59.280]   "Oh, yes, yes, yes.
[00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:02.080]   I love my husband."
[00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:04.560]   I said, "Are you really sure that you love him?"
[00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:05.560]   "Oh, I do.
[00:55:05.560 --> 00:55:06.560]   I love my husband.
[00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:07.560]   Yes, I do."
[00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:08.560]   "And you want to make your marriage work?
[00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:09.560]   Is that right?"
[00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:10.560]   "Oh, yes.
[00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:11.560]   I really want to make my marriage work."
[00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:16.040]   I said, "Well, do you know what the Bible says about what you've said here?"
[00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:17.400]   She got really quiet.
[00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:18.400]   "No."
[00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:19.400]   "What?"
[00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:24.000]   "The Bible says you don't love your husband at all.
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   How can you say that?
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:26.000]   I love my husband."
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:27.000]   I said, "I didn't say that.
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:28.000]   The Bible says that."
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:29.000]   "Where does the Bible say that?"
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:30.000]   "Well, 1 Corinthians 13."
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:33.320]   "Where does it say that in 1 Corinthians 13?"
[00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:38.920]   "Well, the Bible says there that love keeps no record of wrongs."
[00:55:38.920 --> 00:55:54.840]   Well, this is the reason why you're having problems, or at least is a part of the reason.
[00:55:54.840 --> 00:56:08.960]   So there are a lot of women that are very unhappy and really discontent in marriage,
[00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:14.000]   not because they cannot find happiness and contentment, but because they've really not
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:21.160]   known how or even tried to do things God's way.
[00:56:21.160 --> 00:56:26.520]   In most homes as well, roles have sort of been meted out like tossed salad.
[00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:28.440]   Few couples really have a biblical idea.
[00:56:28.440 --> 00:56:33.440]   A husband doesn't have any idea what his role is in our society today.
[00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:37.360]   The wife doesn't know really what her role is from a biblical perspective either, and
[00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:40.200]   so they just try to work things out.
[00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:44.760]   And in our culture, in our postmodern culture today, and there are many who believe that
[00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:53.200]   we're way past postmodernism now, and we probably are, at least from on a philosophical level.
[00:56:53.200 --> 00:57:03.560]   But in our postmodern culture today, egalitarianism is very, very prominent.
[00:57:03.560 --> 00:57:07.680]   Egalitarianism says that God created Adam and Eve as equals in all respects without
[00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:15.040]   distinction as to purpose and/or roles other than is required by actual physical necessity.
[00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:22.880]   It says that the fall destroyed the original mutability of men and women and inaugurating
[00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:30.280]   a period of male over female hierarchy never originally intended by God, and that the new
[00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:35.280]   covenant inaugurated by Jesus Christ restored the original order of mutual submission, thereby
[00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:42.480]   removing all prohibitions to functional equality both in the home and within the church.
[00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:53.720]   One of the primary appeals to that, of course, is Ephesians 5, 21 and 22.
[00:57:53.720 --> 00:58:00.720]   So that's what egalitarianism essentially says in our culture today.
[00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:04.440]   But would we accept that theologically?
[00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:05.960]   No, we would not accept that.
[00:58:05.960 --> 00:58:14.560]   In fact, in contrast to that, we would believe and teach that from a biblical standpoint,
[00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:17.440]   God does not teach egalitarianism.
[00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:25.520]   God teaches complementarianism, that God created Adam and Eve as equals in all respects but
[00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:29.520]   with distinction as to purpose and/or roles in life.
[00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:31.440]   We'll see this in a little bit.
[00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:36.320]   So by God's design, man was originally given loving authority over the woman to whom he
[00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:44.880]   was bound in marriage, and that the fall destroyed the original God-ordained order of male headship
[00:58:44.880 --> 00:58:50.160]   in the marital relationship, inaugurating a period of mutual enmity and a desire by
[00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:58.400]   a woman to usurp the authority given to men at creation, and the new covenant inaugurated
[00:58:58.400 --> 00:59:04.240]   by Jesus Christ reaffirms to the Christian community the original order of male headship
[00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:08.720]   or authority both in the home and within the church.
[00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:12.360]   And with the husband living with the wife in an understanding way and the wife being
[00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:17.440]   subject to her husband as to the Lord, both partners in Christian marriage now complement
[00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:22.600]   each other in their purpose and roles, thereby bringing ultimate glory to God.
[00:59:22.600 --> 00:59:30.100]   It is really the transformation of regeneration brought about through salvation that takes
[00:59:30.100 --> 00:59:40.320]   the sting of that curse away, that would naturally bring about enmity between the two.
[00:59:40.320 --> 00:59:45.120]   Now, take your Bible and let's take a look at our first term here.
[00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:54.160]   Let's go over to Ephesians 5, and I just mentioned just a moment ago in verse 22 where
[00:59:54.160 --> 01:00:00.720]   it says, "Wives, be subject to your own husbands as to the Lord."
[01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:06.160]   Now as soon as we bring up that word subject or submission, I'm wondering what comes to
[01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:08.080]   your mind.
[01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:11.760]   What ultimately does submission mean to you?
[01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:18.880]   For some women, the first thing that comes to their mind is something like this.
[01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:22.600]   This is the idea of submission.
[01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:29.520]   She's walking behind him really carrying the heavy burden of the marriage and all the responsibilities
[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:38.200]   while he is sort of carefree walking before her and leading her in a path wherever it
[01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:39.480]   is that they're going.
[01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:46.480]   Or many women think this, that submission somehow equals that.
[01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:51.080]   Or submission usually ends up being something like this, "Okay, I've got to be submissive
[01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:56.160]   to my husband, so I have the rest of my life to do this."
[01:00:56.160 --> 01:01:00.960]   All right, well, what does it mean?
[01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:03.520]   What does it mean biblically?
[01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:08.700]   Well, the wife has a biblical responsibility to practice submission.
[01:01:08.700 --> 01:01:15.040]   We can see that in Ephesians 5, 22 through 24, as well as 1 Peter 3, 1.
[01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:18.760]   But in order to understand this, we probably ought to take a look at what submission is
[01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:22.320]   not, and then we'll talk about what it is.
[01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:28.120]   Number one, it is not and it doesn't mean inequality.
[01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:30.320]   It never meant that.
[01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:36.240]   It doesn't somehow mean that males are somehow better than females in God's eyes.
[01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:39.720]   That is not the case at all.
[01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:47.680]   In fact, if that were the case, then the very Trinity, the Godhead, there would be a problem
[01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:52.320]   because there is functional subordination even within the Godhead.
[01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:56.440]   You have God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit.
[01:01:56.440 --> 01:01:58.720]   The Son submits himself to the will of the Father.
[01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:01.800]   The Holy Spirit submits himself to the will of the Son.
[01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:06.400]   There is a functional subordination within the Godhead and yet all three are equally
[01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:07.400]   God.
[01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:12.760]   None of them lose any kind of equality as God.
[01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:14.200]   They are all equally God.
[01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:17.640]   They are one as God.
[01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:24.120]   None add or subtract to the godliness of the Godhead.
[01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:27.480]   It doesn't mean inequality.
[01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:30.120]   Number two, it doesn't mean the infallibility of the husband.
[01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:33.960]   There are some women who say, "Okay, I'm willing to be submissive as long as, Lord,
[01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:36.080]   you make him so he doesn't make any mistakes."
[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:40.120]   Well, that's pretty nice.
[01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:45.400]   There's only been one husband on the entire planet that it's ever been that way and I'm
[01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:47.160]   sorry, he's already married to the church.
[01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:49.520]   You can't have him.
[01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:51.040]   His name is Jesus Christ.
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:55.060]   He's the only perfect husband that has ever been out there.
[01:02:55.060 --> 01:02:57.900]   It doesn't mean the infallibility of the husband.
[01:02:57.900 --> 01:03:02.040]   It doesn't mean that somehow the wife is immobile either.
[01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:03.040]   My husband does everything.
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:04.040]   I don't do anything.
[01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:08.200]   Now, I've counseled couples that are like that.
[01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:09.200]   Not younger couples.
[01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:13.480]   Rarely do you ever find a younger couple like that, but older couples I've counseled like
[01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:14.480]   that.
[01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:17.720]   I remember one particular couple where he almost did everything in the marriage.
[01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:18.720]   He went to work.
[01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:20.560]   He had a particular job.
[01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:21.600]   He did all the shopping.
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:22.800]   He handled the checkbook.
[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:23.880]   He did all the driving.
[01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:25.480]   She didn't even have a driver.
[01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:29.640]   Basically what she did was she stayed home, took care of the house a little bit, did a
[01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:33.320]   little bit of the washing, although he did a lot of that too, and a little bit of the
[01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:34.320]   cooking.
[01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:35.320]   That's about all she did.
[01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:40.380]   And as they were getting older, he had pretty serious heart trouble and the doctor said,
[01:03:40.380 --> 01:03:42.960]   "You don't really have a long time to live," and he was scared to death.
[01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:45.000]   What is she going to do without me?
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:46.360]   She can't balance a checkbook.
[01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:47.880]   She can't drive a car.
[01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:55.460]   She doesn't even know how to shop and this has been going on in years in that home.
[01:03:55.460 --> 01:03:57.080]   Doesn't mean that she's immobile.
[01:03:57.080 --> 01:03:58.440]   That's craziness.
[01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:04.040]   That's treating a woman like she's just an appendage without an independent mind or thought
[01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:07.600]   or gifts or talents.
[01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:13.520]   Or it doesn't mean that you have to be inarticulate.
[01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:15.360]   There are some women who think that.
[01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:17.080]   I've got to be just totally silent.
[01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:18.360]   That's what submission means.
[01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:19.360]   No.
[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:23.200]   In fact, the Bible talks about the fact if you have questions and you are to go home
[01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:27.640]   and talk about these questions, theological questions, the implication, in your home with
[01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:28.640]   your husband.
[01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:31.120]   You're not to be silent.
[01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:32.120]   No.
[01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:38.280]   In fact, your husband needs your input.
[01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:43.360]   You need to let your counselees know that.
[01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:47.520]   Whether they like it or not, they need your input.
[01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:51.200]   You have a feminine perspective on life that he doesn't have.
[01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:55.440]   My wife has helped me out numerous times in ministry on that issue.
[01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:56.440]   Remember I'd preach a sermon.
[01:04:56.440 --> 01:04:58.640]   I'd be standing in the back of the church at the foyer shaking hands with the people
[01:04:58.640 --> 01:04:59.640]   and they'd go by.
[01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:01.960]   Couples would go by and they'd say certain things to us.
[01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:04.840]   My wife would be standing with me and talking with them too.
[01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:09.160]   On the way home in the car, she'd say, "Oh, do you remember Mr. and Mrs. Jones coming
[01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:10.880]   by after the service and talking with us?"
[01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:11.880]   "Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:12.880]   I remember that."
[01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:15.040]   "Do you know what Mrs. Jones was saying when she said da-da-da-da-da-da-da?"
[01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:17.520]   I'd say, "Oh, sure.
[01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:19.120]   I know what Mrs. Jones was saying.
[01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:21.440]   She was saying da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da."
[01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:24.920]   "Oh, no," my wife would say.
[01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:27.240]   That's not what she was saying.
[01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:28.680]   "Really?
[01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:31.680]   Well, what was Mrs. Jones saying?"
[01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:37.520]   "Well, she was saying," and of course, as a good woman, she's reading between the lines.
[01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:40.160]   I'm just taking their words at face value.
[01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:45.240]   Major mistake.
[01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:50.000]   She was saying da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.000]   "Really?
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.000]   That's what she was saying?"
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.440]   So, the evening service, I'd see Mrs. Jones.
[01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:58.480]   I'd say, "Mrs. Jones, when we were talking this morning, did you mean when you made these
[01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:01.480]   comments da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da?"
[01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:03.920]   "Why, yes, Pastor.
[01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:04.920]   That's right."
[01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:05.920]   And I know what she was thinking.
[01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:08.520]   "My pastor understands me.
[01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:09.520]   I have a pastor who knows.
[01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:11.320]   I don't have the foggiest idea what she's thinking.
[01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:12.320]   My wife knows what she's thinking.
[01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:16.520]   I don't have the foggiest idea what she's thinking."
[01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:19.280]   But somehow, that kind of clicked.
[01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:23.280]   She gives me a feminine perspective on ministry that I don't have, which I need.
[01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:31.080]   I kind of walk around with male blinders on, just as she can walk around with female blinders
[01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:36.440]   on.
[01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:42.760]   You're going to need his help, as a wife, to understand your teenage sons, and you're
[01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:48.200]   going to need her help to understand your teenage daughters.
[01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:50.120]   What's going on?
[01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:52.960]   So it doesn't mean you're inarticulate.
[01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:58.680]   It doesn't mean that you are intellectually stagnant.
[01:06:58.680 --> 01:06:59.680]   I don't do any thinking.
[01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:03.000]   My husband does all the thinking for me.
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.000]   No.
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.000]   No.
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:09.360]   In fact, God gave you a brain.
[01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:15.800]   When a person, when a wife thinks that, that's really a doormat mentality, because your husband
[01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:19.500]   may ask of you things that are biblically unjust.
[01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:23.720]   They're not right.
[01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:26.920]   And so you have a biblical responsibility to say, "Sweetheart, I love you.
[01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:30.640]   I'm willing to follow you in everything that's right, but as soon as you ask me to do something
[01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:38.200]   that's clearly biblically or morally wrong, I can't do that."
[01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:45.600]   If you don't think through things carefully, a wife can become a doormat.
[01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:47.440]   No.
[01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:48.440]   God gave you a brain.
[01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:53.920]   There's a reason why God gave a wife a brain, and it's foolish if a husband doesn't take
[01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:55.680]   advantage of that.
[01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:58.400]   Furthermore, it doesn't mean that influence is impossible.
[01:07:58.400 --> 01:07:59.840]   By the way, all these start with I.
[01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:00.840]   I'm a pastor, okay?
[01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:01.840]   I have to alliterate.
[01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:09.760]   It's a part of my blood, all right, that your influence is impossible.
[01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:18.160]   I mean, look at 1 Samuel, chapters 1 through 3, where God prepared a woman, Hannah, who
[01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:24.520]   eventually, through her godliness and through the rearing of her son, turns an entire nation
[01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:27.840]   around.
[01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:29.280]   And she was submissive to her husband.
[01:08:29.280 --> 01:08:33.120]   It doesn't mean that your influence is impossible.
[01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:36.040]   And seven, it doesn't mean iniquitous manipulation.
[01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:40.760]   Now, I'm really stretching the I thing here, but it works, all right?
[01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:44.280]   It doesn't mean that.
[01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:47.160]   There are some wives who think that, that if I'm going to be submissive, then I'm the
[01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:50.320]   person that kind of controls things behind the scenes.
[01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:55.480]   You've probably heard the little saying, "The husband is the head of my home, but I'm the
[01:08:55.480 --> 01:08:58.200]   neck that turns the head," okay?
[01:08:58.200 --> 01:08:59.480]   That's the idea behind this.
[01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:02.520]   "Oh, yeah, he's the head of the home, but I'm the neck that turns the head.
[01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:04.000]   I'm the one really controlling.
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:07.480]   He's the marionette out front, and I'm the one that pulls the strings.
[01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:10.840]   I'm the one that makes him move and talk and do all the right things so that he does all
[01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:11.840]   the right things."
[01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:15.200]   No, that's iniquitous manipulation.
[01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:18.300]   No, that's not submission.
[01:09:18.300 --> 01:09:19.840]   So what is it?
[01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:20.840]   What is submission?
[01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:23.960]   Well, it is a divine plan of function and order.
[01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:31.480]   In fact, the word, the Greek term, hupotasso, that's used here is really a military term.
[01:09:31.480 --> 01:09:39.380]   It refers to soldiers in rank marching in order.
[01:09:39.380 --> 01:09:43.480]   One soldier hupotassoing himself to another soldier.
[01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:46.800]   That is, there is orderliness there.
[01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:52.440]   And so that's the reason why we say that it is a divine plan of function and order within
[01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:54.320]   the home.
[01:09:54.320 --> 01:10:00.520]   And really, given the culture of moral chaos that's out there, of all homes, Christian
[01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:04.760]   homes should appear orderly and be orderly.
[01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:09.440]   Now, I was in the military for six years.
[01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:13.040]   I was in the American Air Force, and one of the first things they do is when they get
[01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:19.680]   you in the military is they send you through all kinds of training and stuff, and part
[01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:22.600]   of that training is teaching you to march.
[01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:25.040]   So they'll take you out in the parade field and teach you how to march, and you spend
[01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:26.040]   hours learning how to march.
[01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:27.680]   Now, why do they do that?
[01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:29.800]   So that you'll look good in parades.
[01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:33.680]   No, that's not the reason why they do that.
[01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:45.280]   This is an ancient military idea that goes way back that during war, literally, the culture,
[01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:51.400]   the society is falling apart all around you, and it's the military machine that can maintain
[01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:56.840]   discipline and order in the midst of everything falling apart around them that achieves its
[01:10:56.840 --> 01:10:59.400]   objectives.
[01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:01.200]   This is a good term here.
[01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:08.440]   Hupotasso means maintaining discipline and order within the home.
[01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:12.480]   Soldiers in rank marching in order is the idea.
[01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:15.560]   It's also the way of life for every believer, verse 21.
[01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:21.540]   This is where egalitarians make a major mistake, and they interpret this to mean mutual submission
[01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:22.960]   throughout this passage.
[01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:24.400]   That's not the case at all.
[01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:27.920]   It is not mutual submission in this passage.
[01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:33.800]   On the contrary, he's talking about the fact that as a person grows from the time they're
[01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:40.720]   a little child, they have to learn submission.
[01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:46.080]   When a girl gets married, that's not the first time that she has to all of a sudden struggle
[01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:47.960]   with the concept of submission.
[01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:51.920]   She had to learn when she was a little girl to submit herself to her mother and father,
[01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:59.920]   and then later on to her teachers, and then later on to police officers, and later on
[01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:06.280]   to church leaders, and later on to her Sunday school teacher, and so on and so on and so
[01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:07.280]   on.
[01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:10.680]   As she began to grow up, she had to learn how to submit herself.
[01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:15.360]   Within the body of Christ, we are to be subject to one another in the fear of Christ.
[01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:16.800]   He gives examples of this.
[01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:21.960]   He's not saying that husbands need to submit themselves to their wives.
[01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:30.080]   That's not the case any more than he's saying in chapter 6, verses 1 through 4, that parents
[01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:33.880]   and fathers need to learn how to submit themselves to their children.
[01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:34.880]   That's ridiculous.
[01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:37.960]   No, he's not saying that.
[01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:45.560]   He's just using several different illustrations on how we submit ourselves to one another
[01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:52.720]   as we grow, is the idea, throughout our lifetime, and that's always true.
[01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:53.720]   It's true of men.
[01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:55.920]   Men have to learn to submit themselves to their parents.
[01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:58.560]   Men have to learn to submit themselves to their teachers.
[01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:00.720]   They have to learn to submit themselves to the police officers.
[01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:01.960]   They have to learn to submit...
[01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:05.800]   All of this is true, church authorities.
[01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:09.460]   And even when they become adults, that's still true.
[01:13:09.460 --> 01:13:12.680]   We all submit ourselves to one another.
[01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:17.240]   But then wives need to submit themselves to their husbands, which is another way of illustrating
[01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:18.480]   that.
[01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:21.920]   Children need to submit themselves to their parents.
[01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:25.040]   Slaves need to submit themselves to their masters.
[01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:30.960]   Employers, employees need to submit themselves to their employers.
[01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:32.600]   In that particular context.
[01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:37.120]   So that's why we say it's a way of life for every believer.
[01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:40.760]   It's not something that somehow a woman all of a sudden says, "Oh yeah, I've got to get
[01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:41.760]   married now.
[01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:44.420]   Let me see if I can learn this concept of submission."
[01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:50.520]   If she's had problems submitting herself to her parents, to her teachers, to other people
[01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:55.120]   that are in authority in their church, she's probably going to have a problem submitting
[01:13:55.120 --> 01:14:00.520]   herself to you.
[01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:04.880]   If you're going to marry her.
[01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:07.360]   So what's her attitude?
[01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:09.040]   What's her life like?
[01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:14.880]   Thirdly, it's a protection for the wife, almost like an umbrella.
[01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:17.440]   This is a great illustration.
[01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:20.080]   It's a protection, almost like an umbrella.
[01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:26.560]   And you can imagine just for a moment, a large umbrella, which is a symbol of the husband's
[01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:33.880]   authority, and if she is willing to submit herself and be under that particular authority,
[01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:36.080]   then a lot of decisions are made for her.
[01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:40.720]   He takes the brunt of everything else that goes on in the home.
[01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:42.080]   She doesn't have to.
[01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:48.960]   She has all kinds of freedom underneath that umbrella to do whatever it is she wants.
[01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:54.640]   He's the one that has to shoulder the main responsibilities for what happens.
[01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:59.640]   Now when she decides to walk out from underneath that umbrella, then she gets exposed to the
[01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:02.640]   elements of the world.
[01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:07.040]   Much the same way in 1 Corinthians chapter 5, when the Apostle Paul talks about church
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:15.520]   authority being very similar to an umbrella, and remember this is concerning the young
[01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:23.040]   man who had committed sexual immorality with his stepmother, and the Apostle Paul says
[01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:27.560]   the church needs to excommunicate that young man and says, "Turn him over to Satan,"
[01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:31.240]   Paul says, "for the destruction of the flesh, that his soul might be saved."
[01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:36.240]   In other words, in removing him out from underneath the umbrella of the church's authority, he
[01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:42.360]   exposes that guy to elements in the world, "Turn him over to Satan for the destruction
[01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:47.240]   of the flesh, that his soul might be saved," Paul says.
[01:15:47.240 --> 01:15:51.720]   So removed out from underneath that authority, now he gets exposed to elements that he shouldn't
[01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:59.160]   have to be exposed to, and by the time we get to 2 Corinthians chapter 2, we find out
[01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:06.720]   that the same man ends up repenting and coming back to the church, which is a good thing.
[01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:08.120]   So it's a protection for the wife.
[01:16:08.120 --> 01:16:12.480]   Thirdly, it's an attitude as unto the Lord.
[01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:18.920]   It's an attitude as unto the Lord.
[01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:22.000]   It starts in her heart.
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.160]   It's not just merely external obedience.
[01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:28.960]   It says that I'm going to be submissive to my husband in the same way that I am submissive
[01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:33.840]   to the Lord, and to the degree that she is submissive to the Lord is the degree at which
[01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:38.040]   she is submissive to her husband.
[01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:47.640]   Last little phrase of verse 22 says, "Wives, be subject to your own husband as to the Lord."
[01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:49.480]   So it's an attitude of life.
[01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:52.720]   It's also the act of will and not a feeling.
[01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:56.560]   If you wait, sometimes I'll tell counselees, if you wait until you feel like submitting
[01:16:56.560 --> 01:17:04.680]   yourself to your husband, then it's probably never going to happen.
[01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:11.320]   You've got to do it because you know it's right, and then your feelings will come along.
[01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:17.520]   That's exactly what John 13, 17 says, Jesus there after washing the disciples' feet says,
[01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:20.920]   "Now that you know these things, blessed are you if you do them."
[01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:25.080]   In other words, he knew that this was going to be very hard for them to practice, and
[01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:28.800]   he says, "You've got to do what you've got to do based upon what you know, not based
[01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:30.040]   upon how you feel.
[01:17:30.040 --> 01:17:32.800]   The blessing comes after you do it.
[01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:37.480]   The feelings come along after you do it, but you've got to do it first.
[01:17:37.480 --> 01:17:41.520]   Now that you know these things, blessed are you if you do them."
[01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:45.720]   So the doing of it comes first, then comes the blessing of it.
[01:17:45.720 --> 01:17:52.920]   But you've got to act upon what you know is right.
[01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:58.880]   Then number six, it's the proof of her love.
[01:17:58.880 --> 01:17:59.880]   The proof of her love.
[01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:05.140]   John 14, verse 21, Jesus says, "If you love me, keep my commandments.
[01:18:05.140 --> 01:18:08.320]   You want to demonstrate that you really love me, then keep my commandments."
[01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:12.240]   Same thing's true with a wife's relationship to her husband.
[01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:18.760]   She can talk about loving her husband all she wants, but it's absolutely meaningless
[01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:24.840]   until she's willing to submit herself to him.
[01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:31.720]   Number seven, not only that, but this is also an all-inclusive command.
[01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:37.520]   Look at verse 24, "But as the church is subject to Christ, so also the wives ought to be to
[01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:44.140]   their husbands," and the last two words are, "in everything."
[01:18:44.140 --> 01:18:45.460]   Now the question is, what does that mean?
[01:18:45.460 --> 01:18:52.700]   What if my husband asked me to lie or to cheat?
[01:18:52.700 --> 01:18:53.700]   Should I follow that?
[01:18:53.700 --> 01:18:55.340]   Well, the answer is no.
[01:18:55.340 --> 01:19:01.480]   If you study this within context, it means in everything that is right.
[01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:02.920]   Let me show you an illustration of this.
[01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:05.200]   Let's go over to 1 Peter 3.
[01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:08.300]   We were there earlier.
[01:19:08.300 --> 01:19:10.340]   Let's go back there.
[01:19:10.340 --> 01:19:14.340]   1 Peter 3, and we're interested in verse 6.
[01:19:14.340 --> 01:19:18.340]   Here within the context, earlier in verse 1, he says, "In the same way, you wives be
[01:19:18.340 --> 01:19:22.540]   submissive to your own husbands, so that if any of them are disobedient to the word, they
[01:19:22.540 --> 01:19:27.320]   may be won over without a word by the behavior of their wives."
[01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:33.900]   Verse 6 says, "Just as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him Lord, you have become her children
[01:19:33.900 --> 01:19:38.980]   if you do what is right without being frightened by any fear."
[01:19:38.980 --> 01:19:43.780]   So you're supposed to be submissive to your husband, but it's supposed to be in everything
[01:19:43.780 --> 01:19:44.780]   that is right.
[01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:48.380]   If he tells you to lie, if he tells you to cheat, if he tells you to do anything that's
[01:19:48.380 --> 01:19:54.500]   clearly unbiblical or immoral, then you have a biblical responsibility to say, "Sweetheart,
[01:19:54.500 --> 01:19:56.220]   I can't do that.
[01:19:56.220 --> 01:20:01.340]   I want to follow you, and I'm willing to be submissive to you in any way that you want
[01:20:01.340 --> 01:20:06.480]   me to be, as long as you don't tell me to disobey God."
[01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:10.240]   So at that particular point, then a wife has a biblical responsibility to stand up to her
[01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:15.720]   husband and say, "I can't do it."
[01:20:15.720 --> 01:20:19.360]   So it's an all-inclusive command, but it's an all-inclusive command in terms of everything
[01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:22.180]   that is right.
[01:20:22.180 --> 01:20:26.780]   Now Sarah's a good example of that, because Sarah lied, not just once, but twice, right?
[01:20:26.780 --> 01:20:27.780]   For her husband.
[01:20:27.780 --> 01:20:30.900]   And I think that's what's behind the statement that Peter makes here.
[01:20:30.900 --> 01:20:32.780]   Peter understands this.
[01:20:32.780 --> 01:20:35.420]   Sarah didn't always do that which is right.
[01:20:35.420 --> 01:20:41.940]   She lied to save her husband's skin, because Abraham had said to her, "I want you to tell
[01:20:41.940 --> 01:20:43.580]   them that you're my sister."
[01:20:43.580 --> 01:20:49.980]   Well, she wasn't his sister, and she participated in that.
[01:20:49.980 --> 01:20:55.100]   Well, Sarah is a wonderful woman to follow, but not in everything.
[01:20:55.100 --> 01:20:58.860]   And there are two examples there that you should not follow her.
[01:20:58.860 --> 01:21:02.500]   You're supposed to follow her in everything that's right, though.
[01:21:02.500 --> 01:21:05.620]   And then, then you're a good example.
[01:21:05.620 --> 01:21:10.020]   You're a chip off of Sarah's block, so to speak.
[01:21:10.020 --> 01:21:14.620]   Furthermore, it's a proper relationship to God's authority.
[01:21:14.620 --> 01:21:16.860]   What are we talking about here?
[01:21:16.860 --> 01:21:21.660]   Well, you have a learner's spirit.
[01:21:21.660 --> 01:21:22.660]   You're willing to learn.
[01:21:22.660 --> 01:21:26.100]   You realize that, "Wow, in my flesh, this is not something that I would naturally want
[01:21:26.100 --> 01:21:32.580]   to do, but I'm willing to do it because I believe that God's going to teach me something
[01:21:32.580 --> 01:21:34.540]   great through this.
[01:21:34.540 --> 01:21:39.200]   This is the most honoring thing I can do for God."
[01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:45.860]   And so, it becomes a proper relationship to God's authority, because you believe that
[01:21:45.860 --> 01:21:49.700]   God is in sovereign control over these events.
[01:21:49.700 --> 01:21:56.340]   Even if you question your husband's decision, you say, "Oh, here he is making another goofy
[01:21:56.340 --> 01:21:57.340]   decision.
[01:21:57.340 --> 01:22:01.820]   There's nothing immoral or nothing overtly wrong with it, but it's just not a good one.
[01:22:01.820 --> 01:22:05.980]   It's not a wise one, but I still have a responsibility to follow."
[01:22:05.980 --> 01:22:08.940]   I'm sure there are many times in our marriage my wife has had to do this.
[01:22:08.940 --> 01:22:11.880]   She's sort of rolled her eyes and thought to herself, "Here he goes again."
[01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:20.220]   Well, Lord, I believe you're big enough that you can overrule his stupidity.
[01:22:20.220 --> 01:22:26.940]   You're big enough to do this, and she follows.
[01:22:26.940 --> 01:22:29.420]   So it's a proper relationship to God's authority.
[01:22:29.420 --> 01:22:32.540]   It's also a way to stay youthful.
[01:22:32.540 --> 01:22:38.260]   In fact, if you're still there in 1 Peter 3, he says this.
[01:22:38.260 --> 01:22:44.660]   He says, well, let's start in verse 1, "In the same way, you wives, again, be submissive
[01:22:44.660 --> 01:22:52.980]   to your own husbands, so that even if any one of them are disobedient to the word, they
[01:22:52.980 --> 01:22:58.700]   may be won without a word by the behavior of their wives, as they observe your chaste
[01:22:58.700 --> 01:23:00.480]   and respectful behavior."
[01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:04.860]   And then he says, "Your adornment must not be merely external, braiding of hair and the
[01:23:04.860 --> 01:23:09.380]   wearing of gold jewelry, or putting on a dress, but let it be the hidden person of the heart,
[01:23:09.380 --> 01:23:12.900]   with the imperishable quality of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is precious in the
[01:23:12.900 --> 01:23:15.220]   sight of God."
[01:23:15.220 --> 01:23:21.280]   In other words, as you grow older, you're fighting a losing battle.
[01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:25.460]   Those externals, when you're young, as a young lady, are going to go away.
[01:23:25.460 --> 01:23:27.780]   You're going to get crow's feet.
[01:23:27.780 --> 01:23:31.580]   Your chin is going to sag.
[01:23:31.580 --> 01:23:33.620]   Your hair is going to go thin.
[01:23:33.620 --> 01:23:35.420]   It's going to turn white.
[01:23:35.420 --> 01:23:41.420]   You can take all the vitamins you want and calcium tablets forever and ever ad infinitum
[01:23:41.420 --> 01:23:45.380]   ad nauseam, and you're still going to get stooped over.
[01:23:45.380 --> 01:23:47.280]   Still going to happen.
[01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:57.220]   You can take baths in oil of ole, gallons of it, and you're still going to get wrinkles.
[01:23:57.220 --> 01:24:00.280]   It's just the process of getting older.
[01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:04.460]   So how do I stay attractive in the eyes of my husband?
[01:24:04.460 --> 01:24:08.260]   The answer is, it's the inner woman.
[01:24:08.260 --> 01:24:09.740]   It's the inner woman.
[01:24:09.740 --> 01:24:14.780]   We used to have a couple in our church, and they were an older couple, and I'll never
[01:24:14.780 --> 01:24:20.580]   forget them because she was not the most beautiful woman on the planet, by any means.
[01:24:20.580 --> 01:24:27.100]   But after the service, I'd see people gathered around them because they were such gracious,
[01:24:27.100 --> 01:24:28.100]   godly couple.
[01:24:28.100 --> 01:24:33.820]   They were just naturally attractive.
[01:24:33.820 --> 01:24:38.920]   It was a way to stay youthful, a way to stay beautiful in the eyes of your husband, that
[01:24:38.920 --> 01:24:40.160]   gentle and quiet spirit.
[01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:44.500]   And it's also a picture of how the church of Jesus Christ is to obey Him.
[01:24:44.500 --> 01:24:51.300]   Soldiers in rank, the pillars in place, the church obeying God, this is the way that the
[01:24:51.300 --> 01:24:53.860]   church is to obey Him.
[01:24:53.860 --> 01:24:57.700]   So be submissive to your husbands.
[01:24:57.700 --> 01:25:02.420]   Now, on what is this based?
[01:25:02.420 --> 01:25:06.580]   On what is this based, which is a really good question.
[01:25:06.580 --> 01:25:11.620]   And in order to understand this and answer this, we've got to go over to 1 Timothy 2,
[01:25:11.620 --> 01:25:24.780]   and we're interested in verses 13 and 14, 1 Timothy 2, verses 13 and 14.
[01:25:24.780 --> 01:25:30.900]   The Bible says when, and the context here is worship within the church, but he's talking
[01:25:30.900 --> 01:25:40.960]   about why women need to not exercise authority or teach in the church.
[01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:43.540]   And he explains his theological reasons.
[01:25:43.540 --> 01:25:49.420]   And in verse 13 he says, "For it was Adam who was first created and then Eve."
[01:25:49.420 --> 01:25:56.340]   Which by the way throws a wrench in the argument of most egalitarians, because they'll say
[01:25:56.340 --> 01:26:01.100]   that the whole submission thing is based upon the fall.
[01:26:01.100 --> 01:26:03.420]   It's not.
[01:26:03.420 --> 01:26:07.220]   This was based upon the order of creation.
[01:26:07.220 --> 01:26:11.220]   It was Adam who was first formed and then Eve.
[01:26:11.220 --> 01:26:19.140]   So the foundation of godly submission is built right into the very order of creation.
[01:26:19.140 --> 01:26:25.820]   Even if the fall had never occurred, this still would have been true.
[01:26:25.820 --> 01:26:31.100]   Eve would have still had to submit herself to her husband.
[01:26:31.100 --> 01:26:35.940]   Now it would have been easier because he would have been a perfect husband, and by the way
[01:26:35.940 --> 01:26:39.100]   she would have been a perfect wife.
[01:26:39.100 --> 01:26:42.540]   It would have been easier because she wouldn't have a sinful nature that would have rebelled
[01:26:42.540 --> 01:26:45.580]   against it.
[01:26:45.580 --> 01:26:48.740]   But she still would have had to be submissive to her husband.
[01:26:48.740 --> 01:26:53.300]   In verse 14, not only that but it says, "And it was not Adam who was deceived, but the
[01:26:53.300 --> 01:26:57.220]   woman being deceived fell into transgression."
[01:26:57.220 --> 01:27:04.880]   It's based also then upon the fall, the fall into sin.
[01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:10.380]   And the implication here is that Eve has a problem giving in to people.
[01:27:10.380 --> 01:27:14.500]   That's the reason why submission becomes a protection for her.
[01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:18.940]   And by the way, most business practices and studies have indicated this.
[01:27:18.940 --> 01:27:24.700]   When you get a phone call around suppertime at your home and they want to sell you storm
[01:27:24.700 --> 01:27:31.060]   doors and garage doors and whatever it is they want to sell you, they know statistically
[01:27:31.060 --> 01:27:34.780]   that if they can talk to the woman of the house they'll sell more.
[01:27:34.780 --> 01:27:37.060]   They know that.
[01:27:37.060 --> 01:27:40.420]   Car salesmen know the same thing.
[01:27:40.420 --> 01:27:46.700]   Statistically, if you can talk the woman into it, they have a bigger, greater opportunity
[01:27:46.700 --> 01:27:53.020]   of making a sale than going after the husband.
[01:27:53.020 --> 01:27:57.900]   Eve has a problem giving in to people.
[01:27:57.900 --> 01:28:01.980]   I remember taking my daughter to go buy a car and even though the salesman knew that
[01:28:01.980 --> 01:28:09.260]   I was the one financing the whole process, he almost totally ignored me and focused on
[01:28:09.260 --> 01:28:11.900]   her and what she wanted.
[01:28:11.900 --> 01:28:12.900]   Bad move.
[01:28:12.900 --> 01:28:13.900]   Bad move.
[01:28:13.900 --> 01:28:17.660]   He didn't make any sale.
[01:28:17.660 --> 01:28:23.420]   It's based upon Eve's fall into sin, so it becomes a protection for her.
[01:28:23.420 --> 01:28:27.780]   It's also a lesson that God once taught.
[01:28:27.780 --> 01:28:36.740]   So godly submission becomes, by the way the lesson is, as a wife submits herself into
[01:28:36.740 --> 01:28:43.140]   her husband so the church of Jesus Christ is to submit himself unto the groom and that
[01:28:43.140 --> 01:28:48.380]   is Christ in the same way.
[01:28:48.380 --> 01:28:56.320]   So in order to be a godly husband, or wife, excuse me, you've got to be submissive, submissive
[01:28:56.320 --> 01:28:57.940]   to your husband.
[01:28:57.940 --> 01:29:01.680]   Second thing is Genesis chapter 2 and verse 18, in order to be a godly wife you've got
[01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:05.380]   to be a suitable helper.
[01:29:05.380 --> 01:29:06.380]   A suitable helper.
[01:29:06.380 --> 01:29:13.980]   So Genesis 2 verse 18 says, "Then the Lord God said, 'It is not good for man to be alone.
[01:29:13.980 --> 01:29:19.260]   I will make a helper suitable for him.'"
[01:29:19.260 --> 01:29:20.260]   Now what is this?
[01:29:20.260 --> 01:29:23.180]   This is someone who is ideally suited for him.
[01:29:23.180 --> 01:29:30.220]   She is his perfect complement.
[01:29:30.220 --> 01:29:33.740]   She's not a housewife or a dishwasher or a babysitter.
[01:29:33.740 --> 01:29:37.020]   She is a completer.
[01:29:37.020 --> 01:29:39.180]   She is exactly what Adam needs.
[01:29:39.180 --> 01:29:45.300]   He needs a feminine perspective on life.
[01:29:45.300 --> 01:29:48.700]   Otherwise he's going to be alone.
[01:29:48.700 --> 01:29:59.540]   This also tells us that from God's perspective her husband is her number one primary ministry.
[01:29:59.540 --> 01:30:02.700]   When my wife was a pastor's wife she understood that real well.
[01:30:02.700 --> 01:30:07.260]   The women's ministries wanted her to do this, and other ministries wanted her to do that,
[01:30:07.260 --> 01:30:11.060]   and she would do some things but she would always say my first ministry is my husband
[01:30:11.060 --> 01:30:17.020]   and secondly is my kids, and thirdly is the church.
[01:30:17.020 --> 01:30:21.180]   Her husband is her primary ministry.
[01:30:21.180 --> 01:30:27.140]   She finds her greatest joy and contentment in that role because that's the way in which
[01:30:27.140 --> 01:30:38.260]   God has designed her (Titus 2 verses 3-5) that her main role is to be busy at home.
[01:30:38.260 --> 01:30:45.900]   She is to be a busy homemaker.
[01:30:45.900 --> 01:30:47.540]   She's not a babysitter.
[01:30:47.540 --> 01:30:49.100]   She's not a clothes washer.
[01:30:49.100 --> 01:30:51.140]   She's not a dishwasher.
[01:30:51.140 --> 01:30:54.700]   She's not a housewife.
[01:30:54.700 --> 01:31:02.380]   She is a contributing member of a partnership.
[01:31:02.380 --> 01:31:13.820]   He needs her as his partner.
[01:31:13.820 --> 01:31:20.180]   So in order to be a godly wife you've got to be submissive, you've got to be a suitable
[01:31:20.180 --> 01:31:26.500]   helper, and then last of all, grab your Bible and let's go over to Ephesians chapter 5,
[01:31:26.500 --> 01:31:34.980]   we're back there, and we're interested in verse 33, "Nevertheless, each individual among
[01:31:34.980 --> 01:31:40.820]   you also is to love his own wife as himself, and the wife must see to it that she respects
[01:31:40.820 --> 01:31:43.380]   her husband."
[01:31:43.380 --> 01:31:52.120]   The third area has to do with the fact that she is to be selflessly reverent.
[01:31:52.120 --> 01:31:56.060]   And you need to read through, if you haven't already, what I've attached to your notes,
[01:31:56.060 --> 01:32:04.420]   the Good Wife's Guide there from Housekeeping, monthly, 13th of May, 1955.
[01:32:04.420 --> 01:32:10.340]   That is an amazing description made in a secular magazine back in 1955.
[01:32:10.340 --> 01:32:12.340]   What does it mean to be selflessly reverent?
[01:32:12.340 --> 01:32:14.940]   What does that mean?
[01:32:14.940 --> 01:32:20.540]   Well the word there that's used is the word phobos, it's where we translate sometimes
[01:32:20.540 --> 01:32:27.340]   the word phobia or fear from, but it doesn't mean fear as in terror, it doesn't mean fear
[01:32:27.340 --> 01:32:36.540]   as in horror, it's a word fear that means to deeply respect and reverence.
[01:32:36.540 --> 01:32:43.420]   In other words, it means to honor him, prefer him, venerate him, esteem him, praise him,
[01:32:43.420 --> 01:32:46.860]   love him, admire him exceedingly.
[01:32:46.860 --> 01:32:53.020]   She is to hold him in the highest esteem within her own heart and mind.
[01:32:53.020 --> 01:32:58.180]   Now sometimes when you teach this to counselees, women are standing there and they sort of
[01:32:58.180 --> 01:33:02.080]   sit back in their chair and they say, "Oh, you don't know what this is going to do to
[01:33:02.080 --> 01:33:04.380]   my husband.
[01:33:04.380 --> 01:33:10.900]   This is just going to feed his male ego if I do this and then he is going to be impossible
[01:33:10.900 --> 01:33:14.460]   to live with."
[01:33:14.460 --> 01:33:22.740]   Well I don't deny that in many husbands that could be the case, but in a husband that truly
[01:33:22.740 --> 01:33:30.380]   loves the Lord and a wife does this seriously, it has the opposite effect.
[01:33:30.380 --> 01:33:36.340]   He realizes above all people, he does not deserve that from her because he knows his
[01:33:36.340 --> 01:33:42.500]   own heart and it actually has the opposite effect upon him.
[01:33:42.500 --> 01:33:59.420]   It actually makes him more humble, more gentle, more reasonable, more gracious towards her.
[01:33:59.420 --> 01:34:05.940]   She is to honor him, prefer him, venerate him, esteem him, praise him, love him, admire
[01:34:05.940 --> 01:34:08.020]   him exceedingly.
[01:34:08.020 --> 01:34:13.140]   You know, I don't think there's ever been a case in our marriage where my wife has ever
[01:34:13.140 --> 01:34:16.540]   said anything really negative about me.
[01:34:16.540 --> 01:34:22.600]   At least it's never come back to me.
[01:34:22.600 --> 01:34:29.700]   She does this so well to speak out.
[01:34:29.700 --> 01:34:31.900]   Now I'm not talking about falsely.
[01:34:31.900 --> 01:34:37.180]   I'm not talking about puff up your husband in such a way that it's really not true and
[01:34:37.180 --> 01:34:41.740]   you're attributing to him attributes that are not consistent with his character.
[01:34:41.740 --> 01:34:43.660]   I'm not talking about that at all.
[01:34:43.660 --> 01:34:49.300]   No matter how bad your marriage can be, every wife can still find some good virtuous things
[01:34:49.300 --> 01:34:53.300]   that she can identify in her husband's life that she can respect.
[01:34:53.300 --> 01:34:55.540]   And you know what?
[01:34:55.540 --> 01:34:58.420]   Respect always precedes romantic love.
[01:34:58.420 --> 01:35:00.040]   That's always the case.
[01:35:00.040 --> 01:35:01.600]   Respect always precedes.
[01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:05.920]   And the first thing that goes out the window when romantic love goes out is respect.
[01:35:05.920 --> 01:35:10.380]   You can't really romantically love someone that you don't respect.
[01:35:10.380 --> 01:35:15.860]   You've got to respect them first, then you romantically love them.
[01:35:15.860 --> 01:35:22.220]   And romantic love usually goes out the window because respect has gone out the window.
[01:35:22.220 --> 01:35:27.580]   The reason why a lot of women have fallen "out of love" with their husbands is because
[01:35:27.580 --> 01:35:31.980]   they have not cultivated this respect for them.
[01:35:31.980 --> 01:35:36.460]   And this has to be very intentional on their part.
[01:35:36.460 --> 01:35:41.020]   What does it mean?
[01:35:41.020 --> 01:35:44.020]   It means reverence him, don't try to revamp him.
[01:35:44.020 --> 01:35:45.100]   You know why?
[01:35:45.100 --> 01:35:49.500]   Because you're not his personal Holy Spirit, I tell counselees.
[01:35:49.500 --> 01:35:53.700]   There are some women who think that it's their appointed position in their husband's life
[01:35:53.700 --> 01:35:57.460]   to convict him of sin, righteousness, and judgment.
[01:35:57.460 --> 01:36:01.840]   I am appointed by God to do that, to point out all of his problems, like the woman who
[01:36:01.840 --> 01:36:03.860]   came and brought that whole ream of paper.
[01:36:03.860 --> 01:36:07.380]   I am there to point out every wrong thing that he's ever done.
[01:36:07.380 --> 01:36:08.380]   That's my role.
[01:36:08.380 --> 01:36:10.100]   No, no, no, no, no.
[01:36:10.100 --> 01:36:15.060]   That is the Holy Spirit's role, that's not your role.
[01:36:15.060 --> 01:36:21.620]   And he'll do a whole lot better job than you'll ever do, I tell counselees.
[01:36:21.620 --> 01:36:25.300]   Let the Holy Spirit do his job.
[01:36:25.300 --> 01:36:30.780]   And get out of the Holy Spirit's way.
[01:36:30.780 --> 01:36:38.620]   When you try to revamp him, change him, this is what I believe is that Genesis 3.16 thing.
[01:36:38.620 --> 01:36:44.420]   Control him, manipulate him, revamp him, change him.
[01:36:44.420 --> 01:36:47.700]   Focusing on his negatives becomes your excuse not to obey him.
[01:36:47.700 --> 01:36:48.700]   Well, look.
[01:36:48.700 --> 01:36:50.460]   Look at all the wrong things he does.
[01:36:50.460 --> 01:36:54.620]   He does this wrong, he does that wrong, he does that wrong, I mean, should I follow somebody
[01:36:54.620 --> 01:36:57.140]   like that?
[01:36:57.140 --> 01:37:04.540]   No, is our human conclusion, but God says yes.
[01:37:04.540 --> 01:37:13.780]   Because failure to do so will ultimately destroy your love for him.
[01:37:13.780 --> 01:37:17.740]   It will slowly eat away at him, because you no longer respect him.
[01:37:17.740 --> 01:37:21.520]   I don't respect him any longer.
[01:37:21.520 --> 01:37:26.620]   And when a wife says that, or she's come to that particular conclusion, then she really
[01:37:26.620 --> 01:37:32.340]   doesn't love him, and there's not a whole lot of future for that marriage.
[01:37:32.340 --> 01:37:38.100]   They're just going to perpetually coexist together, or they're going to end up separating
[01:37:38.100 --> 01:37:43.580]   and getting a divorce.
[01:37:43.580 --> 01:37:46.540]   In fact, you could set this up like dominoes.
[01:37:46.540 --> 01:37:58.680]   You can see this fall in a woman's life as a wife, because a failure here, ultimately,
[01:37:58.680 --> 01:38:05.280]   to actively pursue a high degree of respect for your husband will result in growing tension
[01:38:05.280 --> 01:38:14.560]   in your marriage, it's the first domino to fall, increased anger, second domino, discouragement
[01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:22.140]   is the third domino, depression is right on the heels of that, fourth domino, and ultimately
[01:38:22.140 --> 01:38:30.340]   just a general hindering of God's work in your marriage and in your home, fifth domino.
[01:38:30.340 --> 01:38:37.660]   And sometimes when couples come in for marriage counseling, you can almost identify exactly
[01:38:37.660 --> 01:38:41.620]   where they're at by looking at the wife's attitude towards the marriage.
[01:38:41.620 --> 01:38:50.700]   She becomes the barometer on how the marriage is really faring.
[01:38:50.700 --> 01:38:51.700]   Where is it?
[01:38:51.700 --> 01:38:52.700]   Where is that?
[01:38:52.700 --> 01:38:56.980]   What has really happened here?
[01:38:56.980 --> 01:39:00.060]   There are some marriages that will come in, and I'm telling you, they are in intensive
[01:39:00.060 --> 01:39:01.060]   care.
[01:39:01.060 --> 01:39:04.260]   I mean, they're bleeding, and the patient is dying.
[01:39:04.260 --> 01:39:08.180]   This marriage is ready to pass away.
[01:39:08.180 --> 01:39:10.500]   Now is not the time to correct all the problems.
[01:39:10.500 --> 01:39:21.380]   Now is the time to use a tourniquet and triage procedures to keep this thing alive so you
[01:39:21.380 --> 01:39:24.260]   can ultimately bring about real healing.
[01:39:24.260 --> 01:39:27.820]   Then you go after the core issues.
[01:39:27.820 --> 01:39:30.380]   You may have to do that.
[01:39:30.380 --> 01:39:36.700]   And some of these triage procedures is going after a husband or going after a wife and
[01:39:36.700 --> 01:39:40.460]   what they view their role to be.
[01:39:40.460 --> 01:39:44.740]   Serious violations of God's Word has occurred because they are not, as a husband, a learner,
[01:39:44.740 --> 01:39:51.460]   a lover, a leader, as a wife, submission, suitable helper, selflessly reverent.
[01:39:51.460 --> 01:39:54.300]   Somewhere along the line, they've fallen apart.
[01:39:54.300 --> 01:39:55.300]   And they're not going to be able to get back up.
[01:39:55.300 --> 01:39:56.300]   They're not going to be able to get back up.
[01:39:56.300 --> 01:39:57.300]   They're not going to be able to get back up.
[01:39:57.300 --> 01:39:58.300]   They're not going to be able to get back up.
[01:39:58.300 --> 01:39:59.300]   They're not going to be able to get back up.
[01:39:59.300 --> 01:40:00.300]   They're not going to be able to get back up.
[01:40:00.300 --> 01:40:01.300]   They're not going to be able to get back up.
[01:40:01.300 --> 01:40:02.300]   They're not going to be able to get back up.
[01:40:02.300 --> 01:40:03.300]   They're not going to be able to get back up.
