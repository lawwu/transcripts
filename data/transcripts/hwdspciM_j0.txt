[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.560]   - Let's say we've now picked a place.
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.520]   Let's say we have decided the why
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.260]   and we know why we're going.
[00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:12.920]   What kind of research do you think
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.280]   people should be doing in advance
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.440]   versus leaving up to that serendipity
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.640]   you described earlier?
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.680]   - What I like to do is,
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.080]   so I'm just gonna give you an example
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.800]   of from the 52 places trip I did,
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.280]   because I mean, I think it's very out of the ordinary,
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.200]   of course, but I think there's a lot
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.120]   that can be learned for it.
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.920]   One of the things was that I,
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.320]   because I was going to 52 places in 52 weeks,
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.280]   I didn't have time to prepare, right?
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.160]   I luckily had someone at the times who was helping me
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.880]   and she would send me like a really great,
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.600]   like one pager of like,
[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.040]   here's what you need to know about currency
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.240]   and here's what you need to know about,
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.480]   you know, public transportation
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.840]   and here's like the top 10 things to do
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.080]   when you Google the place, right?
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.080]   Like these are the big tourist hits or whatever.
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.560]   I would try to like knock out those 10 things
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.600]   in like an afternoon and be like,
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.400]   okay, so I've done the brass tacks,
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.480]   I've seen that now, like,
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.240]   let me actually have an experience, you know?
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.120]   And I think that goes back to this idea
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.640]   of like travel being more serendipitous,
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.680]   more spontaneous, more connective than it is extractive.
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.840]   I think a lot of the times we think of travel as extractive
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.040]   where it's like, I need to go in there,
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.880]   get things that make me fulfilled and leave
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.680]   and that's, and wash my hands of it
[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.600]   and plan the next trip.
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.600]   And I think leaving things open has been,
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.720]   has always led to the best experiences.
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.160]   In terms of preparation, like, yeah, have a place to stay.
[00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.920]   If it's city-based, find a place to stay.
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.760]   I think beforehand, if you can, go as local as possible.
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:40.840]   And I don't mean Airbnb.
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.560]   I mean, Airbnb is fine if that's what you want to do.
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.640]   But I think there's nothing better than staying
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.240]   at like a family run bed and breakfast.
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.680]   I think it's the best, you know,
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.200]   bathrooms down the hall, you know,
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.840]   dad's making you breakfast in the morning.
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.760]   Mom's giving you tips of where to go shopping.
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.440]   You know, like that vibe, I think opens up so much
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.600]   just in terms of local recommendations,
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.000]   in terms of the feeling of being a local,
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.960]   in terms of supporting local economies,
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.240]   you're staying at like a family run hotel
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.720]   versus the Hilton or whatever.
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.200]   Like that thing goes a long way
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.520]   in terms of where you're putting your money.
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.800]   So I think that's a great place to start.
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.040]   I've had incredible experiences literally just from,
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.120]   you know, an innkeeper in Bulgaria,
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.960]   who over the course of five days of me staying there,
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.040]   kind of gains my trust.
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.840]   And all of a sudden he's showing me old family photos
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.000]   and he's showing me into the basement
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   where there's like a fresco on the wall
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.880]   from like the Ottoman times.
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.320]   And he like keeps it under, like behind glass,
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.120]   'cause it's like his greatest possession now.
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.960]   And it's in this house that he's owned
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.200]   and his family has owned.
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.960]   So just like these experiences that you unlock
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.120]   by like going local, by going small.
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.320]   I feel like you didn't ask me
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.400]   where you should stay,
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.400]   but I do think that is kind of where most people start.
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.800]   And I think thinking even the why in that decision
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.040]   goes a long way.
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.840]   You could just look at TripAdvisor
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.680]   and go with the one with the most reviews with five stars,
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.560]   but then you're just kind of doing what everyone else did.
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.560]   - Right.
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.240]   And is there a time and a place sometimes
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.400]   for staying in like the city center,
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.440]   being really close to things?
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.880]   I don't know if the, you know,
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.080]   kind of bed and breakfast are always
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.680]   kind of located in that area.
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.840]   But you know, maybe you do both.
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.640]   Maybe you do the rural bed and breakfast
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:25.480]   for a couple of days,
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.160]   and then you stay in the middle of a city
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.440]   where you're not really gonna be spending time
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.360]   at the hotel anyway.
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.800]   But I think to go back to kind of what my first steps are
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.400]   in feeling that I'm connected to a place,
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.920]   what I learned to do pretty quickly on my reporting trips
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.040]   is that, and I think this is, it's reporting specific,
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.640]   but I think it's travel,
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.760]   like general tips for travel too,
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.280]   is when I get to a place, especially if it's a city,
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.120]   first thing I do is I leave the camera in the hotel room.
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.040]   I put the phone away in my pocket and I just walk.
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.680]   I'll give myself like an hour and a half, maybe two hours,
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.320]   no destination in mind.
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.920]   I just wanna get the pulse of the place.
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.040]   I just wanna feel it.
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.320]   And maybe I'll get distracted and like sit down for a beer
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.120]   and watch the city go by that way,
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.800]   or a coffee or sit in a park for a little bit,
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.280]   but I just wanna be there.
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.520]   And that means not looking at my phone.
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.520]   The great thing about Google Maps
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.440]   is that you can get completely lost
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.200]   and then use it to find your way back, right?
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.600]   So I just like, if I think a street looks interesting,
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:25.560]   I'll walk down that.
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.440]   If I see a scene happening at the local park,
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.240]   I'll sit down and watch that for 20 minutes.
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.360]   If I strike up a conversation with someone,
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.560]   I'll let that go and see where it takes me.
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.840]   But it's just such a small thing,
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.760]   but it goes such a long way.
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:42.800]   If you're just thinking like,
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.400]   of course you're gonna wanna document things,
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.440]   you're gonna wanna post things to Instagram,
[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.400]   you're gonna wanna share it with friends, all this stuff,
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.760]   but just wait a couple of hours.
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.680]   Do it starting that evening.
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.080]   Give yourself at least a few hours
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.080]   to feel like you're there and you're in the place.
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.440]   And maybe you'll see places where you're like,
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.520]   oh, I need to come back and photograph that.
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.680]   I need to come back during sunset
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.080]   'cause I bet the photographs here are great then,
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.880]   or whatever else that you need to do.
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.640]   And I'm thinking of that professionally, of course,
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.280]   as a photographer and a writer,
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.240]   but I think everyone's into documenting their trips,
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.200]   so everyone's thinking of that.
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.880]   But if you give yourself time to just be,
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.800]   it's really amazing how much better you get the place.
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.840]   You understand it and you feel it in a way that you don't,
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.480]   again, if you're just extracting content from it
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.560]   from the moment you hit the ground.
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:30.400]   - You didn't mention this,
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.520]   but one thing I like to do is,
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.640]   where possible and where not ridiculously inconvenient,
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.600]   get to wherever you're going using public transportation
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.720]   when you first arrive.
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.000]   Taking the train, taking a bus.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.080]   You see people in their normal environment
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.640]   versus if you were to take a taxi
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.640]   or call an Uber in another country,
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.960]   you're just sitting in the back, just moving.
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.080]   So I feel like your trip starts sooner when you do that.
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.080]   - And I think it's, yeah,
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.520]   public transportation is a great tip.
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.960]   I think you really get to know a place.
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.680]   There's cities that I know geographically
[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.680]   through their subway maps versus their actual maps.
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.920]   I know that this stop is here and this stop is here,
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.880]   and that's my understanding of geography.
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:17.040]   And I think it's something that as people get older
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:20.600]   and as people have more money and all these things,
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.520]   you stop doing that.
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:22.720]   Like when you're a backpacker
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.520]   and you're living off the $20 in your pocket,
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.400]   you're taking public transportation or walking
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.680]   because you're not about to drop half your budget
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.080]   on a taxi, right?
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.960]   Now, I think, at least for me who's older and whatever,
[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.040]   it's much easier for me to be like,
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.400]   "Oh, I'll just take an Uber."
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.120]   But if you force yourself to, there's a lot we can learn
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.400]   from our early days of travel,
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.440]   backpacking and whatever else when you're pinching pennies,
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.000]   including the fact that like,
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.840]   yeah, public transportation is gonna save you money,
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.880]   but it also like, you just get to understand,
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.360]   you're seeing the places in between.
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.440]   You're seeing the kind of people that come on
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.840]   on certain stops and get off at certain stops.
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.720]   You're like, you get a really better understanding
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:00.360]   of the place just by getting on a train or a bus
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.840]   or like, you know, in South Africa, the combis,
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.680]   the little mini vans that go around.
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.440]   You just get such a better understanding.
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:09.520]   And people will help you too.
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.440]   And that's another thing that I think it's intimidating.
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:12.280]   Of course it is.
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.040]   But if you're lost, people will help you.
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:17.560]   I mean, I remember trying to find my way
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:22.400]   around the metro system in Tashkent, Uzbekistan,
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.280]   which is incredible.
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:26.320]   I mean, in the case of like former Soviet countries,
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:28.400]   take the subway just to see the metro stations.
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.360]   They're like works of art.
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:30.800]   It's unreal.
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.080]   So I'm taking the metro around in Tashkent
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:35.280]   and I was just so confused.
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:37.440]   I was like, I didn't understand the maps.
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.400]   I was sitting there with like, you know,
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.840]   two handfuls of coins and bills,
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.000]   just like unsure about the denominations.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.520]   I was jet lagged.
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.800]   And someone like saw me immediately and came up to me.
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.480]   And like in broken English was like,
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.320]   where are you trying to go?
[00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:53.080]   I like, I said the name of the stop
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.520]   and just held out my hands with all the coins in it.
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:57.400]   And he just like picked out what I needed,
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:58.920]   put it in the machine, gave me the ticket
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:07:59.760]   and led me on my way.
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:01.720]   You know, it's like you put your trust in someone,
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.920]   someone's gonna help you out.
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:06.520]   And just that interaction too, like I still remember it
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:07.800]   and I'll remember it probably forever.
[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:10.720]   Just that small interaction that you're not gonna get
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:12.400]   if you just call an Uber.
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:13.640]   - Yeah, those things happen.
[00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:17.480]   So we had the same thing happen in Aleppo, Syria.
[00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:21.560]   We got into the city, we took a taxi from Turkey
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:24.640]   and we, which fun fact, taxis from Turkey,
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:25.840]   I mean, I'm sure this is different now,
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.200]   but taxis from Turkey to Syria,
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:31.120]   because gas was like 10% of the cost, right?
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.280]   It was so cheap.
[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:34.360]   The taxis would go for free almost.
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:36.920]   It was like, you know, the cost to go from Turkey to Syria
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:39.760]   was almost nothing as long as you had no bags
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:41.280]   because there were special taxis
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:43.520]   where their entire trunk was just gas tanks.
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:46.280]   And so you would go into Syria and it would be super cheap,
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.880]   but you'd get dropped off and we had,
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:50.320]   we were staying couch surfing in a suburb
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:51.760]   and we had no clue what we were doing.
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:54.800]   And a random person came up who spoke no English,
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.160]   but kind of got the sense that we were lost,
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:59.440]   called someone, handed me the phone.
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:01.760]   So just a stranger's handing me a cell phone
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.200]   and I answer it and this person says,
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.200]   "Hey, you don't know me,
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:08.040]   but my brother says he thinks you're lost.
[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.160]   So he called me and if you want,
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:11.920]   you can tell me where you're going,
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:14.000]   I'll tell him and he can help you get there.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.560]   But he would love if you stopped by his house
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:17.680]   and have some tea first."
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:19.680]   So like it was this experience
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:23.600]   that I think many people could just not be open to
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:24.600]   or think it's scary.
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.200]   And I wanna get at some point before we stop
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.040]   to talk about, you know, risk and safety
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:29.880]   and that kind of stuff.
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:31.160]   But being open to those things
[00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.560]   has been some of the best experiences we have.
