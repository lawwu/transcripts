[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.100]   It's basically four foundational pillars of health.
[00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.420]   What you eat, exercise, your sleep,
[00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:05.540]   and how you manage stress.
[00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.940]   And then I would sort of add your nutritional support
[00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:10.220]   through nutritional supplements that are foundational.
[00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.380]   If you get those things right, 80% of the time
[00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.340]   you're gonna deal with most of the stuff you have going on.
[00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.620]   So start with doing a fridge biopsy.
[00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.460]   If you pick up something and it has a label
[00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.100]   and you don't recognize the ingredients, throw it away.
[00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.580]   Start just choosing real food.
[00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:22.860]   And it doesn't have to be expensive.
[00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.460]   You can go to Costco, you can go to Walmart,
[00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:25.620]   you can go to the big box stores.
[00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:26.820]   Second is, you know, move your body.
[00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.940]   Everybody needs to take a walk for 30 minutes a day.
[00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.740]   Do some simple resistance training.
[00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:31.820]   It can be your body weight.
[00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.620]   There's tons of things on YouTube and online to learn from.
[00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.820]   You don't need a lot of equipment
[00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.340]   and it's important to stay fit.
[00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.660]   Next is optimize your sleep.
[00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.300]   And it requires you to understand what that means.
[00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.100]   And there's a great book by Matthew Walker
[00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.020]   called "Why We Sleep."
[00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.660]   And then of course, managing stress.
[00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:46.500]   How do you deal with that?
[00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.460]   And it's individual.
[00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.980]   Some people like to do breath work or meditation
[00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.900]   or guided imagery or they use sound healing
[00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:53.940]   or binaural beads.
[00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.100]   Everybody needs to figure out
[00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.740]   how to regulate their nervous system.
[00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.820]   and most of us never learn how to do that.
