[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   We close the week with a good question from Singapore, from a listener named Gia.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   Dear Pastor John, thank you very much for this podcast.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   I would like to ask a question, following up on episode 1304 about the parable of the ten virgins.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   In Matthew 25, 11 and 12, Jesus says, "Afterward the other virgins came also, saying, 'Lord, Lord, open to us.'
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   But he answered them, 'Truly I say to you, I do not know you.'
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   Do these two verses imply to us anything about salvation, particularly so when the bridegroom said, 'I do not know you?'"
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   Pastor John, what would you say to Gia?
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   So, do these verses, in the words, "I don't know you," imply anything about salvation?
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   The answer is yes, they do. They imply exclusion from salvation.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   Now, let me step back and give a little reminder. This is a parable, okay?
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   Ten virgins, in the story that Jesus made up, ten virgins are assigned to welcome the bridegroom when he comes to the feast,
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   to go in and enjoy the bride.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   So, to welcome him when he comes. Five take this seriously and stay ready.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   Five are careless and don't have what they need to be ready.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   At the last minute, they run away to try to do a last ditch effort to be ready, and it fails.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   It's too late. And so, here's what we read.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   "While they were going to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Afterward, the other virgins came also, saying, 'Lord, Lord, open to us!'
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   And he answered, 'Truly I say to you, I do not know you.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Watch therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour.'" Matthew 25, 10-13.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   The point is, watch. Not stay awake at night looking up into the sky because all ten slept.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   They all slept. The wise ones and the foolish ones, they all slept. That's not the point.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   But stay awake to your Lord and to your calling.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Be spiritually alert. Awake to your calling and awake to your Jesus, the way of life in Christ.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Stay awake to it. Stay spiritually alert and alive.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Because if you treat the Lord like he's unimportant, you won't enter the feast.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   You won't enter salvation.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Here's the closest analogy to that language.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Matthew 7, 21. "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven."
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   This is why I talk about exclusion.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   "But the one who does the will of my Father who's in heaven, on that day many will say to me,
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and cast out demons in your name
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   and do many mighty works in your name?'
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   And then I will declare to them," here are the words, "I never knew you.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Depart from me, you workers of lawlessness."
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   So "I never knew you" means I don't recognize you as my disciple.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   I don't acknowledge you as my follower.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   You are a spiritual stranger to me.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   Judas would be the best example here from Jesus' life.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   Three years he cast out demons and did many mighty works with Jesus.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   And in the end, he was driven by money, not by love for Jesus.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   We know that from John 12, verse 6. He's called a thief.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   He was excluded at the end of all that time with Jesus.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   So what's with this odd use of the word "know"?
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   I do not know you. I never knew you.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Now there's a back story here. There's background to this.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   For example, in the Old Testament, it was used almost interchangeably with "choose."
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   I didn't choose you. For example, Amos 3, verse 2.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   "You only," God says to Israel, "You only have I known of all the families of the earth."
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   That didn't mean Jesus wasn't aware of the other nations.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Many hadn't chosen them. They weren't acknowledged as his.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   They weren't recognized as his. He hadn't chosen them.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   Or here's Genesis 18, 18.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   "Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation,
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him,
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   for I have known him, that he may command his children."
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   And it's translated usually "chosen."
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   It's just a plain old word "know."
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   "I have known him, that he may command his children and his household after him
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   to keep the way of the Lord," etc.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   So when we come to the New Testament, we read things like this.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   This is Galatians 4.9.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   "Now that you have come to know God, or rather be known by God,"
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   so being known by God is expressing the initiative that God has taken
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   to enable you to know him.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   "Now that you have come to know God, or rather be known by God,"
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   how can you turn back to the weak and worthless elementary principles?
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   Here it is again in 1 Corinthians 8.3.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   "If anyone loves God, he is known by God."
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Wow.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   That means being known by God is the precondition and enabling
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   of how you come to love God.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   So loving God is evidence that you're known by God, that he's chosen by God.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   Now back to our parable.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   "The foolish virgins came too late to the feast of the bridegroom and his bride,
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   and they cry out, 'Lord, Lord, open to us!'
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   And he says, 'Truly I say to you, I don't know you.'"
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   That is, I don't see in you the marks of faithfulness to me.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   There's always a correlation between my choosing people
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   and their belonging to me and the marks of obedient faithfulness.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   We see this in 2 Timothy 2.19.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   "God's firm foundation stands bearing this seal.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   The Lord knows those who are his,
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   and let everyone who names the name of the Lord depart from iniquity."
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   Those are the two marks of the seal.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   I know them, I chose them, and they depart from iniquity.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   So Jesus is saying to the five foolish virgins,
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   "I don't see in you the life, the evidence of loving my name and departing from evil.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   You're not mine. I don't know you."
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   And Jesus concludes, "Watch therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour."
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   Meaning, stay alert spiritually.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   Keep my greatness, my beauty, my worth always before you.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   Don't slip into a greater love for the world.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   If you do, I won't know you.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   Incredibly sobering and humbling.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   There is nothing cavalier about Christian assurance.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   Well, as we talked about this recently,
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   Pastor John and Noel are packing up and getting ready to head out to South America right now.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   That trip is fast approaching.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   And before they leave, we have two more APJ episodes to share with you on Monday.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   We hear from a boyfriend who has a girlfriend who believes homosexual practice is not sinful.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   Is that a marriage deal breaker?
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   Wow.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   Looking forward to that.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   We will see you on Monday.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   Have a great weekend.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   [end]
