[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120]   I still have the same email inbox from forever.
[00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.740]   And if I've ever interviewed somebody, our initial conversation is in that inbox.
[00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.580]   So the founder of Dropbox, I have the first message where he said, yeah, I'll do
[00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.380]   the interview with you, Airbnb, and then other people who you may not know, but
[00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.840]   who matter to me, if I need to reach out to them, I hit reply on that old message.
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.400]   It gives them a sense of who we are.
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.200]   And then it's easier to reconnect.
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.000]   I'm not just somebody who needs something from you.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.400]   Now I've connected with you.
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.280]   I've helped you before through this podcast.
[00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.220]   Now I'm checking in or asking for something.
