[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.380]   - Welcome back to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.740]   We're joined again by special guest, Matt Chandler,
[00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.420]   the lead pastor at the Village Church in Dallas.
[00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.000]   Matt is the author of the new book,
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.020]   The Mingling of Souls,
[00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.820]   God's Design for Love, Marriage, Sex, and Redemption.
[00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.680]   And I've got 10 questions from singles on relationships
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.420]   queued up for Matt, and we're working through them.
[00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.600]   On to question number six.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.700]   Matt, do you think it's wise for a boyfriend
[00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.580]   to lead his girlfriend?
[00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.280]   Should a dating relationship reflect
[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.160]   the complimentary structure of marriage to any degree?
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.540]   It seems biblically and practically wise,
[00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.420]   but it also seems covenantally inappropriate at this stage.
[00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:44.640]   What would you say?
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.240]   - Yeah, I would, there's no doubt
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.440]   that a boyfriend should lead, quote unquote,
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.380]   his girlfriend in some ways.
[00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.140]   But definitely not to the degree
[00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.060]   that a husband leads his wife.
[00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.700]   So what I possess when it comes to the covenant
[00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.160]   I'm in with Lauren is headship, right?
[00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.740]   I have, I've been called by God to lead,
[00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.580]   to cover, to provide, to protect in ways overlawn
[00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.100]   that a boyfriend is not in covenant relationship
[00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.680]   with his girlfriend.
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.480]   However, he should be leading her
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.040]   in regards to godliness, encouraging her
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.460]   in regards to her giftedness.
[00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.700]   I think he should be encouraging her in prayerfulness,
[00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.020]   encouraging her towards an understanding
[00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.860]   and growing knowledge of the word of God.
[00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.740]   He should take responsibility and the lead
[00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.120]   in the areas that as they get to know each other
[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.140]   are clear that she wants.
[00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.900]   So I think, and so I gotta be careful here
[00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.780]   'cause I think I have, I can get my own preferences
[00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.620]   mixed up in this, so I wanna be real careful.
[00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.180]   So let me just kinda put a little asterisk here
[00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.140]   and go, I believe being married to Lauren,
[00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.060]   like what Lauren wants from me is for me to go,
[00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.540]   hey, would you like to go out Thursday?
[00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.700]   Yes, and then what she wants is for me to say,
[00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.700]   hey, we're gonna go to dinner and we're gonna do this.
[00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.420]   She doesn't want me to come home Thursday night
[00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.700]   and say, so what do you wanna do?
[00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.140]   And so for a boyfriend to be saying,
[00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.380]   hey, let's go have dinner, let's sit,
[00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.060]   for him to lead out in protection of their purity,
[00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.060]   for him to lead out in their growing understanding
[00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.620]   of what their relationship is,
[00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.780]   I think the man should be driving those things
[00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:30.940]   even as a boyfriend.
[00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.900]   - Very good, thank you.
[00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.340]   On to question number seven, speaking of sexual purity,
[00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.140]   what are a couple of practical helps
[00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.800]   for staying sexually pure in a dating relationship
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.780]   that actually work?
[00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.620]   - Yeah, that's a funny, to me this question of purity,
[00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.440]   it feels, and again, I've been married for 15 years,
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.660]   but it feels like common sense.
[00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.420]   So one of the things I've said at The Village on repeat
[00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.180]   is nothing good has ever come out of,
[00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.860]   hey, let's watch a movie at my apartment
[00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.180]   starting at 11 o'clock at night.
[00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.140]   Cuddling on the couch watching a movie from 11 to one
[00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.420]   has never ended in a discussion about cinematography
[00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.740]   in the history of the ability to watch a movie on the couch.
[00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.140]   And so to put yourself in that position to begin with
[00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.500]   is a foolish one.
[00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.100]   And so really what works is being in public,
[00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.460]   guarding space alone, not putting yourself in situation.
[00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.180]   I think that singles have a tendency
[00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.560]   to think more highly of their self-control than they should.
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.500]   And so I just think dating in groups or dating,
[00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.980]   just being in public is important.
[00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.500]   And we see that in the song.
[00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.500]   And so I bring this up in the song of song
[00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.380]   that you've got this growing desire
[00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.300]   to physically be intimate.
[00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.800]   And yet she describes their dates
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.460]   as being under this canopy of leaves
[00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.140]   and on this rug of grass.
[00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.140]   They're outside, they're at a park, they're in a forest,
[00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.620]   they're somewhere that's in the public eye
[00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.100]   because they've got this growing passion
[00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.260]   to physically be intimate.
[00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.660]   And yet it's clear that they don't wanna awaken love
[00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:14.660]   before it's time.
[00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.520]   And so they've positioned themselves publicly
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:21.020]   so as to not give themselves over to their lusts.
[00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:23.400]   - That's very wise and practical.
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.260]   Thank you, Matt.
[00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.660]   And tomorrow we will look at question number eight and nine
[00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.260]   on the list and talk about signs that maybe a single
[00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.020]   is just not ready to be dating.
[00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.020]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.620]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
