[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   [Music]
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:09.900]   We have an intriguing Bible question today from a listener named Brandy. "Hello Pastor John, and thank you for your ministry.
[00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.460]   I have a question regarding death and the types of death Paul refers to in his epistles.
[00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:23.180]   I know we all face a physical death and for non-believers, there's a second spiritual death, an eternal death as well.
[00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:29.560]   However, when Paul is speaking in Romans 8 to believers, he says, "If you live according to the flesh, you will die."
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:38.400]   Romans 8 13, "Does Paul mean that our sins somehow shorten our earthly lives or are believers subject to eternal death?"
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.800]   And what does Paul mean when he says that the man in Corinth who has his father's wife
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.060]   is to be handed over to Satan "for the destruction of his flesh."
[00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:54.720]   1 Corinthians 5 5, "What kind of death is this? I feel like I am missing an integral piece to the puzzle.
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.720]   Thank you for your help, Pastor John."
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:03.040]   I love this question, partly because it pushes me to do something I've never done before, namely,
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:09.280]   see how many different ways the New Testament speaks of a Christian dying. I've never done that.
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:17.540]   So instead of just addressing two of the examples that Brandy raises, Romans 8 13 and 1 Corinthians 5 5,
[00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:24.560]   let me mention six ways I see the New Testament speaking of a Christian dying and
[00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.360]   take up those two where they turn up in the sequence. Number one,
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.740]   paradoxically, the Christian life begins at conversion with a death.
[00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.300]   Galatians 2 20, looking back on his conversion, Paul said, "I have been
[00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:46.740]   crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And the life
[00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.660]   I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me."
[00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.260]   When we are converted to Christ, our old, rebellious,
[00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.940]   unbelieving, spiritually dead self dies.
[00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.700]   Dies with Christ, and a new, believing, submissive,
[00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:13.460]   spiritually sensitive life comes into beingâ€”a new creation. That's number one. Number two,
[00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.620]   following from that experience of
[00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.940]   death to our old sinful nature,
[00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.300]   Paul calls us now in view of that reality to
[00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:32.900]   "reckon ourselves to be dead," Romans 6 1. So you also must consider or reckon yourselves
[00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.340]   dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.
[00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:44.100]   So this is an act of faith by which we repeatedly preach to ourselves the
[00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.460]   reality that what happened to us at our conversion
[00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.620]   is true. We really died with Christ. We died to sin.
[00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.460]   We died to rebellion and unbelief, and now by faith we repeatedly
[00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:05.220]   reckon it to be so. I'm dead, sin. You don't rule. We preach to ourselves.
[00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:11.740]   Number three, this is one that Brandy asked about in particular, Romans 8 13.
[00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.420]   We turn
[00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.420]   against every
[00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.500]   arising of our old sinful nature and put it to death
[00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.860]   by the Spirit.
[00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.260]   The sword of the Spirit is for killing, after all. That's what swords are for
[00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.820]   every day. So Paul says in Romans 8 13, "If you live
[00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.580]   according to the flesh, you will die.
[00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.460]   But if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body,
[00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:44.020]   you will live. For all who are led by the Spirit of God are the sons of God."
[00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.900]   So we take one step beyond
[00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.060]   reckoning
[00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.340]   ourselves dead and actually target
[00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.940]   specific uprisings of the old nature and kill them. We kill them.
[00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:03.700]   We kill them by the Spirit. That is, we trust the promise of the Holy Spirit's power
[00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:09.180]   to help us defeat sin, and we say to the temptation, "In the name of Jesus,
[00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:16.060]   you don't own me," and we stick it with the sword of the Spirit, the Word of God, a better promise
[00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:22.900]   than what sin is offering. And Brandy asks whether the death Paul threatens,
[00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.420]   if we don't do this, is
[00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.220]   early physical death. That's one option she
[00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.700]   holds out. Or, she asks, are believers subject to eternal death?
[00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.540]   Well,
[00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:40.060]   eternal death is what Paul has in mind here, not just some kind of
[00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:47.980]   disciplinary suffering or physical death. And we know that because the argument he gives to support it in
[00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:55.340]   verse 14 is, "For all who are led by the Spirit of God are the sons of God."
[00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.140]   In other words,
[00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:04.380]   when we put to death the deeds of the body by the Spirit, we are being led by the Spirit into
[00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:10.180]   that kind of warfare against sin, our sin, and thus we prove
[00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:16.900]   by that warfare that we are the sons of God. If we don't make war on our
[00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.300]   sin, but rather make peace with it,
[00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:28.100]   we show that we are not led by the Spirit of God and therefore not the children of God.
[00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:33.220]   So, no, no, Brandy. The children of God are not subject
[00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:40.700]   to eternal death. But Paul often addresses the church with the warnings of eternal death
[00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:48.100]   so as to make plain who are the true believers who respond to this warning and who are not.
[00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:54.380]   Number four, the New Testament talks about a Christian dying
[00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.380]   in the sense that
[00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.900]   Jesus did and
[00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.580]   Paul did in different words. Here's what Jesus said,
[00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:09.820]   Luke 9, 23, "If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross
[00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:17.900]   daily and follow me." To take up the cross is to take up an instrument of execution. It's like wearing a little
[00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.620]   electric chair around your neck.
[00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:28.020]   It is in a profound sense to die. Like Bonhoeffer said, when Jesus bids a man to come,
[00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:32.980]   he bids him come and die. Now in 1 Corinthians 15, Paul
[00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:35.380]   was pleading
[00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:40.020]   against those who denied the resurrection and in verse 31 he said, "I
[00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:44.540]   protest, brothers. I die every day.
[00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:50.940]   What do I gain if humanly speaking I fought with beasts at Ephesus? If the dead are not raised,
[00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:54.220]   let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die."
[00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:56.180]   I think
[00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:59.460]   this is Paul's way of saying what Jesus said.
[00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:01.820]   Every day
[00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:03.820]   Christians make choices
[00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:06.780]   that to the world look like little deaths,
[00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:09.540]   risking your life in Ephesus,
[00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:17.700]   denying yourself some immediate comfort or security in order to serve someone else. We deny ourselves. We die to ourselves,
[00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:25.980]   our immediate demand for comfort or security or pleasure in order to bring others life and
[00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:29.100]   the greater blessing we find in giving.
[00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.180]   Number five,
[00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:38.780]   for some people like Paul, there are marks of these kinds of dying in their own bodies.
[00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:42.700]   He said in 2 Corinthians 4.10 that he was always
[00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:45.660]   carrying in the body
[00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:52.500]   the death of Jesus so that the life of Jesus may be manifested in our bodies.
[00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:58.180]   And in Galatians 6.17, he said, "I bear in my body the marks of
[00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:01.340]   Jesus." These kinds of scars
[00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:07.380]   mingled with love caused Paul to realize that in a profound sense
[00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:14.300]   he was completing the very death of Jesus by making it tangible or visible
[00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:20.420]   to people for whom Christ died in his own body. He said in Colossians 1.24, "I
[00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:22.860]   rejoice in my sufferings
[00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:25.340]   for your sake and in my
[00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:33.180]   flesh I am filling up what is lacking in Christ's afflictions for the sake of his body, that is the church,
[00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:37.220]   which I take to mean that Paul's very bodily
[00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:39.980]   existence as a suffering
[00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:42.180]   apostle was a
[00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:46.500]   presentation in the flesh of the sufferings and death of
[00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:54.020]   Christ so that people could actually see in Paul by his suffering how much they are loved by Christ.
[00:08:54.940 --> 00:09:01.300]   Then finally, number six, there is physical suffering and death. And if Jesus does not come back first,
[00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:08.860]   every one of us will experience this. It's very close for some of us. In answer to Brandy's question,
[00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:14.500]   when Paul handed over to Satan the immoral person in
[00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:20.020]   1 Corinthians 5.5, who'd been sleeping with his stepmother,
[00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:25.740]   I think Paul was saying that his prayer for this person
[00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:27.700]   was that
[00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:29.220]   suffering and
[00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:31.940]   impending death would shake the
[00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:39.620]   disciplined person out of his spiritual stupor and bring him to faith and life, even if he died.
[00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:43.900]   So now, to get the biblical emphasis right,
[00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:46.980]   we need to end like this. In
[00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:49.980]   every single case of
[00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:54.420]   dying in the Christian life, the biblical emphasis,
[00:09:54.420 --> 00:10:01.700]   amazingly, falls on "for the sake of someone's living." It's always "for the sake of someone's
[00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:09.820]   living" that we talk about dying. We die in order to live. The death at conversion is a
[00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:17.100]   spiritual resurrection of life. We reckon ourselves dead to sin and alive to God.
[00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:24.100]   We kill sin so that we live in righteousness. We lose our lives to gain them.
[00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:29.860]   We carry the marks of Jesus so that people see life, the life of love.
[00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:33.020]   And we die finally and physically
[00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:35.900]   triumphant over sin,
[00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:40.820]   over death, over Satan, only to rise in the last day and
[00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:44.660]   shine like the sun in the kingdom of our Father.
[00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:52.460]   It's always "for the sake of someone's living" that we talk about dying. That is a great word. Thank you, Pastor John, for that.
[00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:55.500]   Thank you for joining us today. Brandy had a great Bible question.
[00:10:55.500 --> 00:11:00.340]   Maybe you have a great Bible question for Pastor John. If so, get it to us through our online home at
[00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:03.180]   DesireWinGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:09.620]   On Wednesday, we return and we are going to look closer at what it means to love Christ above all else.
[00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:13.100]   What does that mean? What does it look like to love Christ above all else?
[00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:18.060]   I'm your host Tony Reinke. We'll see you back here on Wednesday for that. See you then.
