[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.000]   - For the next three days,
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.280]   we welcome to the Ask Pastor John podcast,
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.720]   a guest, Dr. Don Carson.
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.760]   He was with us at the end of June
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.480]   with a valuable perspective on the SCOTUS decision
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.520]   to legalize same-sex marriage in all 50 states.
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.680]   You can find that special episode in the Ask Pastor John app
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.520]   and Dr. Carson, thank you for coming back.
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.360]   I want to shift gears from recent events
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.680]   to ancient trajectories and for the next few days,
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.280]   I want to talk about biblical theology,
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.040]   one of your specialties.
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.160]   Let's start with a definition.
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.280]   What is biblical theology
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.400]   and why does it matter for us as Christians today?
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.700]   - The term biblical theology is used differently
[00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.600]   by different people, but as I use it,
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.920]   it has two or three different foci.
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.960]   In one focus, you work really carefully
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.160]   with each biblical book or corpus, by corpus,
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.000]   I mean something like the John corpus,
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.900]   John for second, third John revelation,
[00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.520]   or the synoptic corpus, or the Pauline corpus,
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.400]   or something like this.
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.160]   You work carefully with each particular book or corpus
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.880]   to make sure you understand what God is saying
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.240]   through that corpus at that time in history
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.180]   with what words, vocabulary, and so on,
[00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.440]   before you ask what contribution
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.120]   it's making to the entire canon.
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.600]   In other words, biblical theology is interested
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.600]   in the careful exegesis of individual books and corpora
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.220]   within the canon and their place
[00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.300]   in the progress of redemption,
[00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.780]   not because it wants to despise systematic theology
[00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.580]   or canonical theology or big picture stuff,
[00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.900]   but it insists that if you don't ask
[00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.440]   those kinds of questions, you can sometimes blur over
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.980]   distinctions that God himself has placed in scripture
[00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:52.500]   and miss things that are a bit different.
[00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.420]   Even the most casual reader of scripture
[00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.380]   knows that John's vocabulary is not the same as Matthew's.
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.120]   And Paul's vocabulary is not the same as Peter's
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.360]   in 1 Peter.
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.840]   And their emphases are a bit different and so on.
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.160]   They're mutually complementary, they tie together,
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.900]   but if you work only at the canonical or systematic level,
[00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:15.300]   then there tends to be a very important set of inferences
[00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.520]   about what the whole Bible teaches, that's right,
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.820]   but sometimes at the expense of listening carefully
[00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.380]   to the particular emphases of particular biblical books.
[00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.480]   And ideally, a good preacher will not only handle
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.680]   the individual text at hand, but show how this text at hand,
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.060]   not in every sermon, but in some sermons,
[00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.220]   is tied to the book or corpus in question,
[00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.280]   and then it's tied to the whole
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.020]   Christian confessional stance.
[00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.640]   Now that's one form of biblical theology.
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.760]   And from this comes New Testament theology
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.480]   and Old Testament theology and so on.
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.640]   The other form of biblical theology tracks themes
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.000]   that run right through the whole Bible.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.800]   There are about 20 biggies, give or take,
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.800]   and 50, 60, 70 small ones that aren't quite so prominent
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.400]   or don't touch quite so many books.
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.720]   But the biggies include things like Jerusalem
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.720]   and temple and atonement and sacrifice and priesthood
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.720]   and covenant and kingdom and so on and so on and so on.
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.720]   And they really do run right through much of Scripture
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.840]   and tie it together.
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.840]   And biblical theology makes you alert to those trajectories,
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.440]   those lines, those ligaments that tie together
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.000]   the whole of canon.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.340]   And it's helpful for the ordinary Bible reader
[00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.320]   to be reading, let's say, Ezekiel,
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.260]   and to knowing where you are on the trajectory
[00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.420]   of what the Bible says about temple
[00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.800]   to figure out where you are on the storyline.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.440]   It's part of what ties things together.
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.160]   And so even when it comes to things like
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.920]   preaching Christ in all the Scriptures
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.640]   and Christocentric preaching and things like that,
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.120]   the way you get there is not by some imaginative,
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.180]   topical imposition of later material,
[00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.960]   but it's by following the trajectories
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.680]   that are actually in Scripture
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.760]   and that do trace the way through Scripture
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.780]   to bring you to Jesus Christ.
[00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.400]   And to understand how those work, I think,
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.600]   is hugely helpful.
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.680]   It increases our faith.
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.120]   It makes us see the wisdom of God
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.440]   in unfolding Scripture in these ways.
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.040]   And we sometimes, as we see these things
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.040]   unpacked before our eyes, bow in worship
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.360]   as we begin to glimpse something of the mind of God
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.960]   and putting these things together.
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.920]   When individual writers along the line
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.480]   themselves could not see all that they were contributing to,
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.760]   even if they could see the current bit
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.880]   where God was using their words to speak to us
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.560]   with infallible truth.
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.080]   - Yes, and amen, it's beautiful.
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.080]   And this is a burden that you feel,
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.060]   and it led you to edit the NIV Zondervan Study Bible,
[00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.360]   which releases next month.
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.040]   The major contribution that this Bible seems to make
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.880]   is that it focuses on a whole Bible, biblical theology
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.000]   for personal Bible reading.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.080]   And as I look at it, the Bible closes
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.920]   with a wonderful collection of essays to this end.
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.220]   So why is a study Bible that focuses
[00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.760]   on a whole Bible, biblical theology, as you've explained,
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.860]   why is that so important for lay readers?
[00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.600]   - Well, it really is important to see
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.320]   that the best study Bibles,
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.360]   even when they're written from slightly different
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.920]   vantage points, have more in common
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.240]   than they have in difference, in contradistinction.
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.500]   A good study Bible devotes its notes
[00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.200]   to explaining difficult things in the text,
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.660]   explaining what's going on,
[00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.160]   and trying to keep the language simple
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.760]   and avoiding too many technicalities.
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.480]   And so that as you read the Bible,
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.120]   there is enough introduction to explain
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.480]   when the book was written and so on.
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.680]   All study Bibles do that.
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.120]   And there are some very good study Bibles out there.
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.020]   So there's no way I want to push this study Bible
[00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.440]   as if it's the be all and the end all in study Bibles,
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.360]   but it does emphasize biblical theology.
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.160]   That is to say, not only in the notes,
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.400]   but in, as you mentioned, 28 or 30 essays at the end,
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.720]   we are trying to track out
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.840]   how certain dominant themes
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.280]   run right through the whole Bible
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.700]   to enable readers to see where they are in the Bible
[00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:23.560]   at any particular point, and thus put it all together.
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:27.260]   Now, another study Bible might use the final pages
[00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.280]   to build a whole systematic theology,
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:30.720]   and I won't criticize that.
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.580]   That too needs to be done.
[00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:34.560]   And so they rush, as it were,
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.060]   immediately to creating a whole confessional stance
[00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:37.900]   out of the Bible.
[00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.060]   And it is good to read the Bible in such a way
[00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:41.680]   as to see how the various parts
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.360]   contribute to the big picture theology.
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.200]   But on the other hand,
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.580]   sometimes Christians find it hard to see
[00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:52.960]   how you move from exegesis of particular chapters
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.280]   all the way to big picture theology
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.120]   without seeing how you get there.
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:01.880]   And the way you get there is through the tracking out
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.840]   of these particular emphases in biblical books
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:07.040]   and then in these trajectories or these typologies,
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.680]   these ligaments, these tendons
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.240]   that tie the whole Bible together
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.000]   until you see how the big picture
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.480]   is actually coming together.
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:19.180]   And that's what this NIV study Bible is trying to do.
[00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:20.640]   - Yeah, well, it's a noble goal,
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.320]   and I don't think anyone is better qualified
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:23.720]   to lead a team to this end.
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:26.480]   Thank you, Dr. Carson, for your work on the study Bible.
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:30.280]   It's officially titled the NIV Zondervan Study Bible,
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.200]   edited by T.A. Carson,
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:35.000]   not to be confused with the NIV study Bible.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.160]   It's the NIV Zondervan Study Bible.
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:39.560]   And the Bible traces out themes
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.020]   throughout the comments and the text,
[00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:42.800]   and then ends with 28 essays
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:45.620]   on the most important biblical theological themes,
[00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:47.140]   including the temple.
[00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:48.560]   And we have run out of time,
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.720]   but I want Dr. Carson and you to come back tomorrow
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.200]   and show us how biblical theology works.
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.440]   We know how it's defined.
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:55.640]   Now we want you to show us
[00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:57.960]   how it actually works in the text.
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:00.360]   And I want you to show us specifically
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:02.920]   from the example of the temple as one theme
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.120]   and why it's so central to the Bible
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:07.360]   and how it develops throughout the Bible.
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.560]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:11.060]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast
[00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:12.620]   with guest Don Carson.
[00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:15.040]   (soft music)
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.460]   (soft music)
[00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:19.880]   (soft music)
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:21.940]   you
