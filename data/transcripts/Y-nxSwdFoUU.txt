[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760]   The approach dictates how successful you're going to be.
[00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.160]   And when I was researching this a long time ago,
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.840]   I came across a study in the University of Haifa in Israel
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.960]   that found that under the right circumstances,
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.160]   adults are better language learners than children.
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.040]   And that sounds very counterintuitive
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.640]   because all the evidence we see out there is
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.600]   what children are clearly learning languages more than adults are.
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.680]   And that is because it's not under the right circumstances for those adults.
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.600]   The adults are taking dusty old grammar books.
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.960]   The adults are going to group classes
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.200]   where they're kind of zipping it and letting a teacher talk at them.
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.000]   The adults are not truly living through the language.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.240]   The adults don't have any friends in the language.
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.720]   They're not playing games in the language like a child does.
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.560]   And the child has a better language learning approach.
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.240]   It's not that they are better at language learning.
