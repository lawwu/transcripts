[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.220]   My dad always talked about just don't have credit card debt.
[00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.400]   That was the one thing that was reeled into me from an early age.
[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.840]   It's one of the worst decisions you can make.
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:06.820]   And I still believe that.
[00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.700]   But I think especially since I've had kids, the idea of just spending money and enjoying
[00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.120]   some of it now, that has been a big mindset shift for me.
[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.660]   That if you would have told me that in my 20s and early 30s, I would have said, you're
[00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.880]   nuts.
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.380]   No, you think about how much you're giving up on compounding interest over time and all
[00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.760]   these things.
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.420]   And I do think that's one of the areas where the younger generation has learned to enjoy
[00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.120]   themselves more.
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.860]   Now, older generations may look at them and say, they're overdoing it.
[00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.320]   They're spending way too much money.
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.720]   But I think that mindset shift is way different now of just things like paying for convenience
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.160]   and again, traveling and paying for experiences.
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.100]   I think that's something that a younger generation gets right.
