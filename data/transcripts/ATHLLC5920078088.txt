[00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:03.740]   Hello, and welcome to All The Hacks.
[00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.420]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins, and I'm a diehard optimizer.
[00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.880]   We're talking spreadsheets for everything.
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.920]   I love doing all the research to get the best experience in life
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.720]   without the expensive price tag.
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.400]   And I'm on a quest to continue to learn all the hacks.
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.940]   So in each episode, I'll interview a new expert and dive
[00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.280]   into all their secret deals.
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.320]   Whether they're travel hacks, like finding first class or
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.620]   staying at a five-star hotel for free, career hacks, like landing
[00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.420]   your dream job or getting promoted faster, money hacks, like finding
[00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.240]   the best credit card or making extra cash with side hustles, or
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.780]   even parenting hacks, like finding the best deals on baby gear or
[00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.340]   skipping the wait list at daycare.
[00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.180]   To be clear, this is not a show about how to save money by eating
[00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.300]   beans and rice or staying at a Motel 8.
[00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.140]   It is much more about eating at Michelin star restaurants and
[00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.220]   staying at the Four Seasons for less than half the cost, or
[00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.380]   even free with points.
[00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.460]   So if you want to learn all the hacks to upgrade your life and

[00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.700]   released the first episode or check out all the hacks.com.
[00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.100]   Thanks for stopping by.
[00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.780]   I want to tell you about another podcast I love that goes
[00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.480]   deep on all things money.
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.620]   That means everything from money hacks to wealth building to early
[00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.420]   retirement, it's called the personal finance podcast, and it's much
[00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.820]   more about building generational wealth and spending your money on
[00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.380]   the things you value than it is about clipping coupons to save a dollar.
[00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.420]   It's hosted by my good friend, Andrew, who truly believes that everyone
[00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.700]   in this world can build wealth and his passion and excitement are
[00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.700]   what make this show so entertaining.
[00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.140]   I know because I was a guest on the show in December, 2022, but
[00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.820]   recently I listened to an episode where Andrew shared 16 money
[00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.340]   stats that will blow your mind.
[00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.500]   And it was so crazy to learn things like 35% of millennials are not
[00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.780]   participating in their employer's retirement plan, and that's just
[00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.580]   one of the many fascinating stats he shared.
[00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.540]   The personal finance podcast has something for everyone.
[00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.900]   It's filled with so many tips and tactics and hacks to help you get
[00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.300]   better with your money and grow your wealth, so I highly recommend you
[00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.940]   check it out, just search for the personal finance podcast on Apple
[00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.780]   podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you listen to podcasts and enjoy.
