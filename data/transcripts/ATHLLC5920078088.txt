[00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:03.740]   Hello, and welcome to All The Hacks.
[00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.420]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins, and I'm a diehard optimizer.
[00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.880]   We're talking spreadsheets for everything.
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.920]   I love doing all the research to get the best experience in life
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.720]   without the expensive price tag.
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.400]   And I'm on a quest to continue to learn all the hacks.
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.940]   So in each episode, I'll interview a new expert and dive
[00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.280]   into all their secret deals.
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.320]   Whether they're travel hacks, like finding first class or
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.620]   staying at a five-star hotel for free, career hacks, like landing
[00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.420]   your dream job or getting promoted faster, money hacks, like finding
[00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.240]   the best credit card or making extra cash with side hustles, or
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.780]   even parenting hacks, like finding the best deals on baby gear or
[00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.340]   skipping the wait list at daycare.
[00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.180]   To be clear, this is not a show about how to save money by eating
[00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.300]   beans and rice or staying at a Motel 8.
[00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.140]   It is much more about eating at Michelin star restaurants and
[00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.220]   staying at the Four Seasons for less than half the cost, or
[00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.380]   even free with points.
[00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.460]   So if you want to learn all the hacks to upgrade your life and

[00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.700]   released the first episode or check out allthehacks.com.
