[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.460]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:11.120]   Paul's epistle to the Ephesians, the first chapter, and I shall read verses 15, 16, and
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:20.080]   17, verses 15, 16, and 17, in the first chapter of Paul's epistle to the Ephesians, wherefore
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:27.620]   I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and love unto all the saints, cease
[00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:34.920]   not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers, that the God of our
[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:45.360]   Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:52.200]   in the knowledge of Him. I want particularly to deal with the first part, this great statement
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:01:02.340]   at the beginning of verse 17, that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory,
[00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:09.460]   may give you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him.
[00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:15.760]   We began the consideration last Sunday morning of this prayer of the great apostle for these
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:21.140]   members of the Church at Ephesus. In the first fourteen verses he has been reminding them
[00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:27.820]   of the riches of God's grace, displaying it to them in all its wonder and all its amazing
[00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:36.280]   character. Having ended his description, he now proceeds to apply this to them, and he
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:43.620]   tells them that he thanks God for them. He is praying for them, he tells them. He ceases
[00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:51.760]   not to give thanks for them, making mention of them in his prayers to God.
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.940]   Now I reminded you last Sunday morning that his prayer is divided, as all prayer always
[00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:04.740]   should be, into thanksgiving and then petition. Thanksgiving, which includes generally adoration
[00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:11.820]   and worship, and then he proceeds to petition. That is the order in which our prayers should
[00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:17.420]   always be offered. Last Sunday morning we dealt with his thanksgiving. He thanks God
[00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.460]   for these Ephesians, and he has got two main reasons, you remember, for doing that, namely
[00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:32.100]   for their faith in the Lord Jesus and their love to all the saints. We saw how those two
[00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:40.620]   things constitute, therefore, a very delicate and real test as to whether we are Christians
[00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.280]   in truth and in fact, or only in word. It is ever the characteristic of the Christian,
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.460]   and they are the two signs and marks of the Christian which are quite infallible, that
[00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:58.980]   he has faith in the Lord Jesus and love toward all the saints.
[00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:07.420]   Now, having done that, we go on with our consideration of this great prayer. The apostle now is approaching
[00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:16.020]   the question of his petition for these people. Let us observe him as he proceeds to do this.
[00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:22.200]   It is a great lesson, this. There are many Christian people who are constantly in trouble
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:29.700]   over this whole question of prayer. I suppose that there is no aspect of our Christian life
[00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:35.900]   that so frequently raises problems in people's minds as prayer, and I think that that is
[00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:45.860]   very right. Prayer is, after all, the highest activity of the human soul. The greatest thing
[00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:54.080]   any one of us ever does is to pray, and therefore, of necessity, it is something that should
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:02.220]   present us with certain difficulties. Any man who is privileged to preach will, I am
[00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:11.820]   sure, agree with me when I say that preaching is child's play when compared with praying.
[00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:17.220]   It is a much easier thing to preach than to pray, because when one is preaching, one is
[00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:27.180]   speaking to men, but when one prays, one is speaking to God, and God is unseen, and therefore
[00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:33.100]   there are inevitable difficulties. People are very concerned about this. They often
[00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:39.340]   ask questions about it, and that is why you will generally find in the great periods in
[00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:45.740]   the history of the Church that books and manuals are written on this whole question of prayer.
[00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.340]   People say they find it difficult to concentrate, they find it difficult to know how to speak,
[00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:56.780]   how to form their petitions, and so on. The moment you say that you take prayer seriously,
[00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.620]   you begin to find what a tremendous thing it is. Of course, if you just mechanically
[00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.380]   say your prayers, you are not aware of any difficulties at all. It is so simple. You
[00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.780]   just repeat the Lord's Prayer, and offer up your few petitions, and you pray, but my
[00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:16.060]   dear friend, you have not started praying. The moment you begin to face what rarely happens
[00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:23.460]   in prayer, well then, I say you find inevitably that it is the profoundest subject that you
[00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:33.340]   have ever considered. Oh, how little have we prayed. How little do we know about prayer.
[00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:40.020]   It is not surprising that the disciples of our Lord turned to him one afternoon and said,
[00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:48.140]   "Lord, teach us how to pray," as John taught his disciples. But I think they were
[00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:52.780]   not only thinking at that moment of John teaching his disciples, they had been watching their
[00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:59.980]   Master himself, and they said, "Lord, teach us how to pray." And I do not hesitate to
[00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:04.540]   assert that unless you have ever felt like that, or offered that petition, it is certain
[00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:09.700]   that you have never prayed in your life. If you have never been aware of difficulties,
[00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:16.500]   it is that you have never realized what prayer is. Very often I say we can do nothing better
[00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:24.020]   than to watch some of these great models and examples which we have in the Scriptures in
[00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:30.700]   such abundance. And none better, surely, and none greater than this mighty man of God,
[00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:37.940]   the Apostle Paul. Let us watch him as he prays. Fortunately, not only here, but in other places,
[00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:44.060]   he tells us how he prays, and what he does, and something of what it means to him. So
[00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:49.620]   let us look at him and observe everything he says. Let us watch every word. I have been
[00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:54.980]   emphasizing that as we have been studying this great epistle. If you really want to
[00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:59.220]   derive benefit from biblical study, you must watch every word. Do not take anything for
[00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:04.940]   granted. How easy it is for us to read a statement like this and just imagine that it is a number
[00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:09.580]   of words without much significance. We really want to get on to know what Paul is praying
[00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:14.060]   about. What are his particular petitions? That is where we are interested. We say that
[00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:19.140]   the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you the Spirit. Then we
[00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:25.180]   become interested. But the other has been a phrase to us, but not to the Apostle. He
[00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:34.300]   takes the trouble to tell us exactly what he does and why he does it. Therefore I say
[00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:43.100]   that we must concentrate on this because I want to suggest this to you. If we only rarely
[00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:49.140]   get the essence of the Apostle's teaching at this point, I think it will make all manuals
[00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:55.340]   on the subject of prayer quite unnecessary. People are interested in questions of posture.
[00:07:55.340 --> 00:08:00.740]   Should you kneel? Should you stand? Should you prostrate yourself? And all sorts of things.
[00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:05.380]   Other manuals generally deal with things like that, and the time and so on and so forth,
[00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:10.340]   and the order and the arrangement. Well, I suppose up to a point there is a place for
[00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:15.780]   such things. But I think you will find, if you read the literature and the question of
[00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:22.300]   prayer and read the lives of the saints, that all that tends to characterize what we may
[00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:28.820]   describe as the Catholic view of worship, whereas the Protestant view, which is surely
[00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:35.540]   the more spiritual view, pays less and less attention to such details because, being right
[00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:43.220]   at the center and on the fundamental principle, these other things tend to look after themselves.
[00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:47.940]   At any rate, here is the big thing and the most vital thing of all. Well, now then, let's
[00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:53.100]   observe what we find here. The first thing we notice is that the Apostle prays to God
[00:08:53.100 --> 00:09:04.460]   the Father. Now, that has its significance. He doesn't pray to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:12.100]   He doesn't pray to the Holy Spirit. Now, I don't want to make too much of this point.
[00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:20.520]   It is a point that has often engaged the attention of theologians and expositors, and that rightly.
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:24.460]   And yet, of course, it is a point of which we can make too much. It is certainly a subject
[00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:30.620]   on which we cannot speak with any finality because, as our Lord himself reminds us in
[00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:36.740]   his teaching, life eternal is to know the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou hast
[00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:43.700]   sent. And it is possible for the Christian to have fellowship with the Father and with
[00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:49.460]   his Son, Jesus Christ, and obviously by the Holy Spirit, and therefore fellowship with
[00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:56.860]   the Holy Spirit. But still, it is interesting to observe that the Bible, speaking generally,
[00:09:56.860 --> 00:10:03.460]   teaches us to address our prayers to God the Father.
[00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:10.380]   I pause to make this point at all for one reason only, and that is that I sometimes
[00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:17.420]   have rather got the impression that many people seem to think that the hallmark of spirituality
[00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:23.820]   is that you pray to the Lord Jesus Christ. So I am making this point in order that such
[00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:29.860]   friends may go back to the scriptures again and discover whether that is really so. And
[00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:39.100]   I think you will find that it is not so, and that the prayers here are offered to the Father,
[00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:45.620]   that the Lord Jesus Christ is the mediator, he is not the end. He is the one who brings
[00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:55.060]   us to the Father. We go to the Father by him, he is the Great High Priest, he is our representative.
[00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:59.980]   So that we do not pray to him, but we pray to the Father in the name of the Lord Jesus
[00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:06.660]   Christ, through the Lord Jesus Christ, relying upon the Lord Jesus Christ. He brings us to
[00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:14.120]   God, and all he has done, he has done in order to bring us to God, not to himself.
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:19.900]   As I say, I do not want to attach too much importance to it. And yet it is vital that
[00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:26.780]   we should observe this, because there is an enemy who is always ready to mislead us, and
[00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:32.160]   if he can get us to put a false emphasis, he is ever ready to do so. And I have sometimes
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:37.220]   thought that perhaps the greatest danger confronting us who are evangelical at the present time
[00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:48.180]   is, and I speak with reverence, so to emphasize the person of the Son, that we forget the
[00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:54.460]   Father. And we have failed to realize, therefore, that the Son came, as I shall show you, to
[00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:59.580]   glorify the Father and to bring us to him.
[00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:04.420]   Now of course I think we are often misled by the hymns. In so many hymns you will find
[00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:11.000]   prayers to the Lord Jesus Christ and prayers to the Holy Spirit. So I suggest to you that
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.900]   it is a valuable and a profitable study for you to take your hymn books with their prayers
[00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:21.560]   to the Son and to the Holy Ghost, and to search your scriptures to find what evidence you
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:26.820]   can find there for such a practice and for such a habit. The Apostle Paul at Innorit
[00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:31.580]   here quite specifically, as you will find everywhere else in this great epistle and
[00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:37.660]   in his other epistles, he offers his prayer to God the Father.
[00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:44.780]   Very well, then. We go on now to a second matter, which is this. And it is the most
[00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:53.620]   important thing here, the way in which the Apostle prays to God. This is, I take it,
[00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:59.420]   the most vital thing of all. And here again I would say we can do nothing better than
[00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:05.740]   to observe in detail his method and follow it. Let's watch his terms, let's ask ourselves
[00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:10.700]   why did he say that? Why does he put it like this? Why does he pray in this way? If you
[00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:16.620]   want to get benefited out of scriptures, ask questions to the scriptures, talk to the scriptures.
[00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:21.220]   Take every phrase and say, "Now why did he say that? Why this?" And get at it, he's
[00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:27.060]   got a reason. He doesn't throw out words haphazardly, he doesn't just say things thoughtlessly.
[00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:32.340]   The Apostle knows what he's doing, he's moved by the Spirit and filled with the Spirit,
[00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:37.780]   and he prays like this because, well, this is how the Spirit has taught him to pray.
[00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:43.460]   Very well, then. What do we see here? Well, the first thing we observe is that the Apostle
[00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:53.340]   pauses to remind himself of certain things. Yes, he is writing to these Ephesians and
[00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:58.940]   he's been reminding them of the riches of God's grace, and he's so glad that they've
[00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:05.220]   come into it, in whom he also has received the inheritance after that he believed and
[00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:10.540]   so on, and he wants to thank God for this. And there he is now going to thank God. But
[00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:19.940]   before he does it, he pauses. He pauses to remind himself of certain things before he
[00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:27.500]   begins to speak. He reminds himself of what he's going to do. He reminds himself of
[00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:35.300]   the One to whom he's going to speak. Now, I don't know what you feel, but for myself
[00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:44.420]   I'm absolutely certain of this, that just there is the whole key to the question of
[00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:51.820]   prayer. I go further and I suggest that all our difficulties in detail over praying, all
[00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:57.860]   of them ultimately arise because we fail to do this thing that the Apostle invariably
[00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:07.740]   did. He doesn't get on his knees or stand, or whatever it was, and begin to speak. He
[00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:15.860]   stops. He pauses. He recollects. He meditates. He talks to himself first. He reminds himself
[00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:23.260]   of what he's going to do. He reminds himself of the One to whom he's going to speak.
[00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:27.780]   Now I say, if we only did that truly, and did what the Apostle does here, I think we'd
[00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:33.300]   begin to pray truly. We are all creatures of extremes, are we not? We tend to oscillate
[00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:38.820]   from one violent extreme to the other. There are two main excesses in connection with prayer.
[00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:45.620]   The one is, again, that kind of liturgical view of prayer, which concentrates its attention
[00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:51.260]   upon the beauty of worship, the beauty of the phrases, the beauty of the words, the
[00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:56.140]   beauty of the diction and the balance, and its forms and its ceremonies. That's a type
[00:15:56.140 --> 00:16:01.220]   of worship. That's, generally speaking, the liturgical, the Catholic type again, which
[00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:08.180]   is concerned about the form. And it can be very beautiful, let us grant that, but surely,
[00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:14.180]   speaking generally, it's very remote. And there's such emphasis upon the beauty and
[00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:21.540]   the greatness and the august, that somehow or another you feel that God is far away in
[00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:26.860]   the distance, and there's an unreality about it. It's very aesthetic, it may be artistic,
[00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:33.940]   but it doesn't suggest a living act of worship. That's one extreme.
[00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:41.140]   But then so many of us, in reacting against that and from that, we rush to the other extreme
[00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:49.380]   and we regard praying as just a series of telegraphic petitions with no aberration,
[00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:55.780]   no worship, no praise, and we rather think that this is a sign of great spirituality,
[00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:59.820]   that we are so familiar with God and we are in such perfect standing, we rush into the
[00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:03.420]   presence of God and we offer a sentence or two of petition and finish, and then others
[00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:09.100]   do the same. Then we may offer a few more. This brief, telegraphic petition, which is
[00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:16.660]   the opposite extreme of the liturgical, remote type of worship.
[00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:23.460]   But again I suggest that both the extremes are wrong, and that if you follow the model
[00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:28.820]   and the example of the great apostle, you will find that he invariably combines what
[00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:36.940]   is good and right in both. The two elements are always present, and he always puts them
[00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:42.300]   in the right order. There was no man who knew how to pray better than this apostle, there
[00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:48.260]   was no man who had had a greater abundance of answers to his prayer. He prays with confidence,
[00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:52.700]   with boldness of access and of assurance, and yet the other element was always there
[00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:53.700]   first.
[00:17:53.700 --> 00:18:01.140]   Well, no, then let's watch him as he goes along. But do let us realize this, the importance
[00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:13.100]   of recollection, the pause, the questioning, the reminder. I'm sure we all could give
[00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:20.460]   endless experiences as to how we have caught ourselves in this respect. Let me admit it
[00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:28.420]   from this pulpit, I caught myself in this very respect only yesterday. I wanted to thank
[00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:35.980]   God for something, but I also had something else to do. And I was on the point of offering
[00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:41.500]   up a hurried thanksgiving to God in order that I might go on, when I suddenly said to
[00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:46.500]   myself, "That's not the way to thank God." Do you realize who you're going to
[00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:53.980]   thank? Everything must be put aside when you're turning to him. Everything, everybody, all
[00:18:53.980 --> 00:19:00.340]   things. What are they face to face with him? Stop, pause, wait a moment, recollect, realize
[00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:09.380]   what you're doing. And it's here I say we all tend to fail. We don't realize to
[00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:15.020]   whom we are going to speak. Well, let us listen to the Apostle, he tells us here. He reminds
[00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:19.820]   himself of certain things concerning God before he utters a word. This is how he puts it,
[00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:28.820]   he prays, "Unto the God of our Lord Jesus Christ." That's to whom he's going to
[00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:35.460]   pray. Now why does he say that? Why does he use this term? Why does he pray, why does
[00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:40.900]   he thank and offer his petitions to the God of our Lord Jesus Christ? Why doesn't he
[00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:45.940]   just say, "I'm going to pray," and offer up his petition and go away? No, no, he deliberately
[00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:52.580]   says, "I'm praying to the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, and I never forget when I go
[00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:59.140]   to him that that is who he is." Well, what's he mean? Well, it means something like this,
[00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:07.020]   he's not praying to an unknown God. He's not, as that poem puts it, thanking whatever
[00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:13.700]   gods may be for his unconquerable soul. No, no, he's going into the presence of someone
[00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:19.460]   who is known to him. He is going into the presence of a God who has made himself known,
[00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:27.860]   a God who has made himself, has revealed himself, and who has enabled us to know him in a particular
[00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:30.980]   way. Now let me put it like this. You read your
[00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:36.340]   Old Testament, and you will find that they prayed there to the God of Abraham and of
[00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:43.100]   Isaac and of Jacob. And it's very difficult for us to realize what a phrase like that
[00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:48.180]   meant to an Old Testament saint. He had seen something of the power and the majesty of
[00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:54.340]   God in a thunderstorm or a pestilence or in the conquering of some enemy. God had manifested
[00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:59.540]   his power, and these people had a conception of the greatness of God. And the tendency
[00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:07.580]   was to be afraid to go near God. But then they remembered that this God was the God
[00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:18.860]   of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob, the God of our fathers, the God of Israel.
[00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:22.980]   What's it all mean? Those are the terms. You go through the Old Testament prayers,
[00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:26.660]   and you'll find that that's their terminology. They are praying to this God whom they know
[00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:32.700]   in that way. Well, of course, it's an essential part of the Old Testament teaching. What it
[00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:39.900]   really means is that he is a covenant God and a covenant-keeping God. When a man in
[00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:45.820]   his fear and trembling went to God and said, "O God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,"
[00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:50.980]   what he was really saying was this, "O God, I come as realizing that thou hast revealed
[00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:56.380]   thyself, that thou hast said certain things, that thou hast made a covenant with my people,
[00:21:56.380 --> 00:22:02.820]   the people to whom I am privileged to belong, and therefore with me." God, do you remember,
[00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:09.620]   had made a covenant with Abraham that in his seed all should be blessed and that he would
[00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:14.380]   bless his seed in particular? He had pledged himself. He had sworn with an oath. He had
[00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:19.820]   confirmed it with an oath. There was the promise to Abraham and all his seed, and these people
[00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:24.220]   belonged to that seed, so they went in the confidence and the strength of that God of
[00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:32.020]   our fathers, God of Abraham, the fear of Isaac, the God of Jacob, the God of Peniel. They
[00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:38.460]   went with this confidence, knowing him in that way. He's a covenant God. Ah, yes, but
[00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:42.580]   you see, the apostle doesn't pray to the God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Jacob. He prays
[00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:50.580]   to the God of our Lord Jesus Christ. Why? Well, there's a new covenant. God has now
[00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:57.980]   made a covenant with men in the person of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. The covenant
[00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:03.100]   of grace, the covenant of redemption, now given in this form. It is the same covenant
[00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:08.900]   as the old one, but now it's in the person of the Son, a second Adam, the new man, the
[00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:13.620]   representative of the human race, is now the Lord Jesus Christ, and God has covenanted
[00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:20.860]   with him for his people. So that when Paul reminds himself that he's praying to the
[00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:26.500]   God of our Lord Jesus Christ, he's reminding himself that he's praying to the God of our
[00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:32.980]   salvation. He's praying to the God who has done all the things that we've been considering
[00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:39.900]   together from verse 3 to verse 14, the God who was before the foundation of the world,
[00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:46.260]   chosen and elected and planned and drawn and worked out the purpose in Christ. That's
[00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:55.180]   the God, the covenant God in Christ, the God of our salvation. And what a difference it
[00:23:55.180 --> 00:24:02.940]   makes to prayer when you start like that. You don't go to God now and certainly are
[00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:07.940]   with doubts or queries as to whether he's going to receive you and glad to see you and
[00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:11.660]   to receive you. You remember that you're really going because he's done something
[00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:19.700]   to you that draws you. The covenant, you're in the covenant. Our Lord Jesus Christ, God's
[00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:26.260]   mediator for us. It means that. But it doesn't only mean that. I think it means this. He
[00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:36.420]   is the God who is and was actually the God of the Lord Jesus Christ himself. And we realize
[00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:45.740]   what that means, don't we? In eternity, God the Father was not the God of God the Son.
[00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:50.060]   But when the Lord Jesus Christ came unto earth and took on him the likeness of men and of
[00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:59.740]   sinful flesh, he went to God as a man. And then God became his God. So he's able to
[00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:05.220]   speak at the end of my God and your God, my Father and your Father. You see, the whole
[00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:10.940]   of the incarnation is introduced here. The God whom I'm approaching, says Paul, is
[00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:19.460]   the God of Jesus my Lord, is the God of the Lord Jesus Christ himself. So you can look
[00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:26.180]   at it like this. You go back and read your four Gospels and you read that the Lord Jesus
[00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:33.460]   Christ arose a great while before dawn and went up into a mountain to pray. He was praying
[00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:38.740]   to this same God. So I, says the apostle, am going and I'm going to pray to the same
[00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:47.500]   God as the one to whom he prayed, the God on whom he relied for everything, the God
[00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:52.220]   who sustained him. He said that the words he spoke he spake not of himself, the Father
[00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:56.660]   had given them to him. And the works he did the Father had given him to do. There is nothing
[00:25:56.660 --> 00:26:01.780]   that is so obvious about our Lord's life as his utter reliance upon God the Father.
[00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:07.860]   He gets strength and power, sustenance and all he needs from him. And I, says Paul, am
[00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:15.340]   going to the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the God who sustained him and the God who
[00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:20.940]   held him, the God who never forsook him. There was a moment when he had lost his face but
[00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:27.420]   he immediately adds, "Into thy hands I commend my spirit." The God who raised him from the
[00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:32.180]   dead, who didn't forsake him in hell and leave his soul to see corruption, but brought
[00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:36.700]   him up again from the dead. That's the God to whom I'm praying, says Paul, the God of
[00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:38.620]   our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:47.620]   Yes, but it goes even beyond that, doesn't it? It's the God in whose presence the Lord
[00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:58.220]   Jesus Christ is at this moment. The God in whose presence he is as our advocate, as our
[00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:04.980]   intercessor. He is seated at his right hand ever living to make intercession for us, so
[00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:10.860]   that I go with this assurance. The God of our Lord Jesus Christ. Let me sum it up by
[00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:18.820]   putting it like this. He is the God who rarely cannot be thought of truly apart from the
[00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:25.340]   Lord Jesus Christ because we can't know him without him. No man hath seen God at any time.
[00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:29.620]   The only begotten which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him. And it's
[00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:35.220]   on the basis of that declaration I go to him. He's the God who has been revealed by him.
[00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:42.980]   He's the God, I say, who brings me to him. He is the one who has died in order that I
[00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:53.260]   may have this access. I enter into his presence in one way only. As the author of the epistle
[00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:59.060]   to the Hebrews puts it, "Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest
[00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:07.140]   by the blood of Jesus." The God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the one whom I am admitted into
[00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:15.060]   his presence by the life and death and resurrection. The God who sent his Son to save and who has
[00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:22.180]   treasured in him all his treasures of wisdom and of grace. For me, the riches of his grace
[00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:33.660]   which I receive in this way. The God of our Lord Jesus Christ. In other words, I am approaching
[00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:44.060]   the God who has promised me all these things in his own Son. Has pledged himself to them
[00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:50.340]   in his Son. Has covenanted with the Son. He is Jehovah, the covenant giving and the covenant
[00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:56.900]   keeping God. And he will never break his word. And he's given it in his Son. No longer
[00:28:56.900 --> 00:29:03.700]   in prophets, no longer in parts, in pieces, in types. In his Son.
[00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:10.580]   Therefore, as the apostle puts it in the third chapter and in the twelfth verse of this self-same
[00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:22.620]   epistle, in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him. So that
[00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:27.940]   whenever we pray to God, we should always remind ourselves of these things. We should
[00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:34.100]   go with full assurance of hope and full assurance of faith because of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:38.060]   But we must stop to recollect this and to work it out and to remind ourselves of it
[00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:49.260]   all as the apostle invariably does. The God of our Lord Jesus Christ. And then this edition.
[00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:59.740]   Listen to it. He prays that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of Glory. Why
[00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:06.580]   does he add this? What does it mean? What is this phrase of God as the Father of Glory
[00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:12.020]   as well as the God of our Lord Jesus Christ? Well, this has troubled the commentators throughout
[00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:16.740]   the centuries. And some have tried to avoid the difficulty by saying that what it really
[00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:23.020]   means is this, that it should read that the God of Glory, the Father of our Lord Jesus
[00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:28.200]   Christ. But it doesn't mean that. And it's doing violence to language to try and make
[00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:35.540]   it mean that. The two phrases are separate as we've got them in this authorized translation.
[00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:44.940]   What does it mean then? The God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of Glory.
[00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:54.860]   Now, my friends, let me admit freely that I attempt to expound these two words with
[00:30:54.860 --> 00:31:03.780]   fear and trembling. Who am I to speak on such words? I hear the voice coming to me and saying
[00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:09.300]   the same thing as it's said to Moses at the burning bush, "Take off the shoes from
[00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:21.140]   off thy feet, for the ground whereon thou standest is holy ground." Father of Glory.
[00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:28.740]   What's he mean? Well, there is no doubt that it means partly this, that God is the source
[00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:36.660]   and the embodiment in and of himself of all glory. There are phrases like this in the
[00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:40.660]   Scripture. Do you remember them? We read of God in the epistle to the Hebrews in the twelfth
[00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:46.100]   chapter as the Father of Spirits. We read of him in the epistle of James as the Father
[00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:51.300]   of Lights, with whom is no variable, let's not have the shadow turning. You remember
[00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:56.900]   there's a word in Isaiah chapter nine, verse six, where there is a description of the Eternal
[00:31:56.900 --> 00:32:04.060]   Father. It really means Father of Eternity. So it means, when you have this phrase, the
[00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:13.500]   Father of Glory, the source, the fount of all glory. What is glory? And it's just
[00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:25.700]   there we fail so utterly and completely. Glory is God. Glory is the summation of all the
[00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:33.340]   excellences and perfections and attributes of the Lord God Almighty himself. That is
[00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:41.900]   why you will find him referred to at times in the Scriptures as the Glory. Ultimately
[00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:52.380]   the characteristic of God is glory. He is that in and of himself. His essence is glorious.
[00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:57.860]   It is unutterable, absolute perfection.
[00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:05.940]   And so we stand in amazement before this great phrase, the Father of Glory. Do you remember
[00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:11.740]   Stephen on trial and addressing the court? He starts his great speech in the seventh
[00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:16.580]   of Acts by putting it like this. He reminds them of history and he says, "History begins
[00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:26.020]   in this way. The God of Glory appeared to our father Abraham, the God of Glory, the
[00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:32.260]   glorious God, this being who is ineffable and indescribable, who dwelleth in a light
[00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:44.780]   that is unapproachable, whom no man hath seen or ever can see, the God of Glory. That is
[00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:51.260]   the one whom you and I approach in prayer." Yes, and everything he does is a manifestation
[00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:57.140]   of his glory. You remember that Paul wound up his great description of the plan of salvation
[00:33:57.140 --> 00:34:02.980]   in these words unto the praise of his glory in verse 14. We considered it about a fortnight
[00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:08.460]   ago. Well, that's it. Everything he does is a manifestation of his glory. Paul says
[00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:15.420]   in the epistle to the Romans in the sixth chapter, in the fourth verse, that Christ
[00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:23.900]   was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father. Everything he does is a manifestation
[00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:31.820]   of his glory. The heavens declare the glory of God. Do you see it in the sun? You should.
[00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:37.140]   The glory of God in the sun and the moon and the stars and the firmament and the flowers
[00:34:37.140 --> 00:34:42.620]   and the whole of creation and of nature. They are declaring the glory of God. Everything
[00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:49.420]   he does is glorious. It is magnificent. It is wonderful. It is perfect in its beauty
[00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:59.340]   and in every other respect. The Father of Glory.
[00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:04.220]   You know, again I speak with reverence, the greatest thing the Lord Jesus Christ did was
[00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:09.460]   to manifest the glory of God. You read his high priestly prayer in the seventeenth of
[00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:14.620]   John and you will find that he says that and he claims that at the end of his work, "I
[00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:25.420]   have manifested unto them thy glory." And you know he is going to do so again because
[00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:32.020]   he describes his second coming in these words, "For the Son of Man shall come in the glory
[00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:42.180]   of his Father with his angels." He came to glorify God. That is why I said at the beginning
[00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:47.540]   that Christ really brings us to God. He has done everything he has done in order to glorify
[00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:52.100]   his Father, and therefore we must not stop short of that. He brings us not to himself,
[00:35:52.100 --> 00:36:00.420]   he takes us to the Father. He takes us and comes with us. God and the glory of God is
[00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:08.860]   the end and the terminus of salvation. But I believe it also means this, and this is
[00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:15.340]   where it is of such value to us in our acts of prayer, the Father of Glory. Yes, it can
[00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:22.020]   be read like this if you like, "The Glorious Father." It is a Hebraism. The Hebrew is rather
[00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:27.220]   fond of doing that. Take that phrase that we often use. We quote one of Paul's epistles
[00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:32.500]   when he says that he has been given the privilege of preaching the gospel, the glorious gospel
[00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:37.500]   of the blessed God. That is how the author has put it. But you know, a better translation
[00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:44.460]   is this, "The gospel of the glory of the blessed God." Not the glorious gospel, but
[00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:50.380]   the gospel of the glory. Well, now this is the same, the Father of Glory, the Glorious
[00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:59.300]   Father, if you like. So that it means this, that God the Father is not only glorious and
[00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:06.060]   the source of all glory and the summation of all glory in himself. He is one who is
[00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:12.500]   prepared to manifest that glory and to reveal that glory and to impart that glory. He is
[00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:18.980]   a Father and a Father gives, a Father generates, a Father passes on. God is not someone who
[00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:25.580]   keeps his glory to himself, if I may so put it. He gives it out. He manifests it. He imparts
[00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:31.740]   it. He did so with the Son, didn't he? So that the Son, again in the 17th of John, he
[00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:37.540]   prays this, "Father, I pray that thou wouldest give me the glory that I had with thee before
[00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:42.580]   the foundation of the world." He had laid it aside for the purposes of the incarnation.
[00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:47.020]   He now asks that he may have it back, and the Father gave it him. And then you remember
[00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:52.420]   our Lord's prayer in another place, just before the cross, he said, "Father, glorify
[00:37:52.420 --> 00:38:01.060]   thy name." And he does glorify himself in the Lord Jesus Christ. Listen to Peter saying
[00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:07.940]   that, "Who by him do believe in God, that raised him from the dead and gave him glory,
[00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:14.300]   that your faith and hope might be in God." The Father glorified the Son while he was
[00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:19.620]   here on earth. He gave him power to perform miracles. He gave him words to speak. He enabled
[00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:24.860]   him to raise the dead. He glorified him in his death. He glorified him in the resurrection.
[00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:37.900]   He has put glory on him. He is the glorious Father, the Father who gives his glory to
[00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:51.100]   the Son. Yes, and this is the thing that staggers us because of its immensity. Because he gives
[00:38:51.100 --> 00:39:01.420]   his glory to the Son, he is ready to give it also to us. I pray to the God of our Lord
[00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:09.340]   Jesus Christ, the Father, the glorious Father, not like an earthly Father, but the Father
[00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:19.500]   who is in glory and who is glorious, the glorious Father. He has given the glory to the Son
[00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:26.220]   and we are in the Son because he is our Lord Jesus Christ. He is the head, as Paul is going
[00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:30.420]   on to say before the end of this chapter, and we are the members of his body. So the
[00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:36.020]   glory that is in him becomes ours, and we go to the Father who is giving this glory.
[00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:40.660]   We wait upon him. We desire to know his glory. Paul is going to pray about that, that we
[00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:45.740]   may have the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of this glory, the eyes of
[00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:51.260]   our understanding being opened, that we may see this glory and receive it and be filled
[00:39:51.260 --> 00:40:00.060]   with it. He is our Father and will manifest his glory to us. So again I end by quoting
[00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:08.300]   our Lord in the seventeenth of John, "Father, I will that these also may be with me where
[00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:17.060]   I am, that they may behold my glory." And this is the astounding thing. When you and
[00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:23.300]   I go in prayer into the presence of God, we should go expecting some revelation of the
[00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:29.780]   glory. We all with open face beholding as in a glass, the glory of the Lord are changed
[00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:37.420]   into the same image from glory to glory. The process of our glorification has already started.
[00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:43.300]   It will eventually be perfect when we shall be glorified even in our bodies as well as
[00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:57.460]   in our spirits and shall stand in the presence of the Father of glory and see God.
[00:40:57.460 --> 00:41:10.780]   Oh, my dear friends, let us never again attempt prayer without reminding ourselves that we
[00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:20.620]   are going to speak to the Father of glory. We needn't be terrified. We go with reverence
[00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:28.180]   and godly fear. We must because of his glorious character. But at the same time we can go
[00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:40.420]   with confidence and assurance because he is the God of our Lord Jesus Christ. And in him,
[00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:54.220]   our Father, our Father, who art in heaven hallowed be thy name.
[00:41:54.220 --> 00:42:07.180]   And if we start by realizing that we can't go wrong. Amen.
[00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:11.300]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones. All of
