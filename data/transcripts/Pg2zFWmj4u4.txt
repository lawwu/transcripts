[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Christ is our Sabbath rest.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   We celebrate this beautiful truth every Lord's Day, every Sunday.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   But what about on a day like today, on Monday?
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   Is Christ my Sabbath rest today at work?
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   That's Pam's question for you, Pastor John. It's a good one.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   Pastor John, hello, she writes, "Christ is our Sabbath rest, a hearty amen to that wonderful truth,
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   to the degree that I understand it, and I don't think I fully understand it quite yet.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   This seems to mean a lot more than Christ has set apart one day of rest for us, the Lord's Day, on Sunday.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   At the very end of APJ 658, you called Christ our 'eternal rest,'
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   and that means you said, 'pervading all our work, we are restful in Christ.'
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   Can you explain this to me? How is Christ our Sabbath rest even while we are working?"
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   If we had time, we would dig into Hebrews chapters 3 and 4,
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   because there, that amazing author presents an argument for the present rest of the people of God
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   and the future eternal rest for the people of God.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   He urges us in 319 and 4.1 to fear lest we attain or fail to attain the rest, meaning fear unbelief,
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   because belief is the only way into the rest of Jesus Christ, both now and in the future.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   But we don't have time to do that as much as I'd love to, and I want to go straight to Pam's main question,
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   namely, how do we experience the rest, the Sabbath rest of Christ at work?
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   In other words, what meaning does it have while we're expending great energy
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   to speak of enjoying the restfulness of Christ in that very moment of wearying exertion?
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   So the text that I have in mind now is not Hebrews, but Matthew 11, 28 to 30, where Jesus says,
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   "Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I'm gentle and lowly in heart,
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   and you will find rest for your souls, for my yoke is easy and my burden is light."
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   So the burden and the yoke of the lordship of Jesus is easy and light.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   So in the midst of our labor, our strenuous efforts to do our very best in our vocation,
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   the submission at that moment to the demands of Jesus is called a restful experience.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   You will find rest for your souls precisely in the midst of your exertions
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   to do your job with excellence for his glory.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   So what is that experience like? I think that's what Pam's really asking.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   What's it like working as hard as you can and in the very doing of it,
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   experiencing Christ as our soul's rest, not just after it, not just before it,
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   but in it, in the very exertion of our life's work?
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   So here are four ways that we can experience the soul rest of Christ as we are doing our work.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   First, we work with the sweet assurance that we stand already justified before God,
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   not on the basis of our work, but on the basis of faith alone in Christ's work,
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   even as we work. So Romans chapter 4, verses 4 and 5.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   How sweet are these words? "Now to the one who works,"
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   and he has in mind working for justification, working to get right with God,
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   "to the one who works, his wages are not counted as a gift, but as his due.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   To the one who does not work for justification, to get right with God,
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as righteousness."
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   If we don't get this right, nothing will be right.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Our souls enjoy the glorious, precious, sweet restfulness of knowing that we are right with God
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   through faith alone and that the work we are doing, sweat on our face, weariness in our bones,
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   exhaustion in our minds, is not done to get right with God.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   Yes.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   We are delivered from the horrible torment of soul that thinks,
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   "I must work, I must do a good job so that I can get right with God,
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   I can get a right standing before God."
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   That kind of restlessness and anxiety and striving is over.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   The verdict has been rendered by the King of Heaven, "Not guilty, my son, not guilty, my daughter."
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   So go about your work with a deep restfulness of soul.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   Number two, in Christ, we work hard with the thrilling energy that we are loved by God
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   very personally and forever.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   Ephesians 2, 4, amazing verse.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   Paul says that God's great love, and that phrase "great love,"
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   I think it's the only place in his letters he uses that very phrase.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   God's great love made us alive in Christ.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   That means we were dead and he made us alive because of love
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   before we did anything to get the love.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   We do not work with the restless, nervous anxiety of trying to win the affections
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   of a lover that we're not sure of.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   The great love of God, if we're alive in Christ, it was great love already that put us there.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   So picture this analogy, to feel what it means to work out of the thrilling energy of being loved.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   Suppose I have been dating Noel, who's now been my wife for 54 years,
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   but this was true once upon a time.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   Suppose I've been dating Noel for just several weeks,
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   and I feel very strong affections welling up in me,
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   and I'm thinking, "This is the woman I want to marry."
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   But I'm not sure what her affections are yet.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   Then the day comes when she needs some heavy lifting done for her
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   as she moves a dozen boxes or so, books, furniture, from one apartment to another,
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   I go to her apartment to help her move.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   And as I start to go down the stairs where she has everything packed up,
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   she puts her hand on my arm, and I turn to look at her,
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   and she says right into my eyes for the first time,
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   "I love you, Johnny. What happens to my exhausting work that afternoon?"
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   [laughter]
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   Oh, my goodness.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   There flows into it a thrilling energy of being loved.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   There is in the exhaustion of the heavy boxes a restfulness of soul of not wondering anymore,
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   "Am I loved? I am loved. I am loved."
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   And, of course, the analogy breaks down a little bit
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   because God doesn't need any help with lifting heavy boxes. I got that.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   But the principle is the same.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   He gives me the privilege of serving His purposes in the world,
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   and He takes away all of its burdensomeness by saying, "I love you. I've got you.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   I love you. I choose to love you."
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   Number three, the analogy of Noel's love, however, is not nearly good enough to capture the point.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   God's love doesn't stand by, like Noel stood by, and watch us lift the boxes of life.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   Watch us do our job at work.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   He doesn't stand by and watch, counting on us to muster the energy because we're loved.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   His love commits Him to help us. Help us.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   He steps into our lives by His Spirit within us
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   and becomes the kind of energy that turns our work into something far greater than mere human achievement,
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   even in response to love.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   It becomes a kind of God-wrought miracle that gets Him praise and touches other people
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   in ways we can't begin to explain when we're operating in the strength of God.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   I say this because in 1 Peter 4, verse 11, Peter says,
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   "Let the one who serves," you could say, "works."
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   Serve, work by the strength that God supplies in order that in everything God may be glorified through Jesus Christ.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   To Him belong glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   In other words, there is a restfulness in work because God is an inexhaustible helper in our work
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   so that our energy is really, in a profound sense, His energy supplied to us.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   Number four.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   Therefore, the obstacles that always meet us in our work
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   and which formerly robbed us of peace and restfulness and filled us with anxiety,
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   those obstacles don't have that effect anymore
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   because now we know nothing is too hard for the Lord, Jeremiah 32, 17, nothing.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   And He works everything together for our good, Romans 8, 28.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   So, at least for those four reasons, we can speak of Christ being our rest, rest for our souls,
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   even in the very exertion of our daily work.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   Beautiful and robust explanation of this rest for our souls.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   Thank you, Pastor John. It's a lot to meditate on here, a lot of connecting threads working out
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   from this great reality of Christ, our Sabbath rest as we head off to work or to school on this Monday.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   Thank you for joining us today. If you want to ask Pastor John,
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   type your question out and email it to me at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   Well, if you were to sit down with John Piper's Collected Works, his 13-volume Collected Works published in 2017,
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   and you read the entire thing cover to cover, you'd come across the word "satisfied"
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   almost 1,500 times. "Satisfied." It's all over his works, all over his ministry.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   But you'd likely not read a definition. So, what does John Piper mean when he uses the word "satisfied"?
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   You want to know, and now I want to know, and we'll ask Pastor John on Thursday.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke. We'll see you next time.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   (music)
