[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   I didn't write the book to have some, you know, utopian idea of, Oh, let's just all
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.760]   just be really sweet to each other.
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:14.560]   I wrote it because I wanted people to start seeing themselves as kind as an identity,
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:15.560]   not as an act.
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.360]   Because whatever you believe you are is what you'll attract.
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.200]   But also whatever you believe you are, you will stay true to, even if you mess up, even
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.600]   if you stumble, you're going to return back to that baseline of who you see yourself as.
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:34.640]   So if you see yourself as kind, not just somebody who can be kind, but your full identity as
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.240]   a person is kind, then you can come back to center.
[00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.020]   That will be your, your star.
[00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.400]   If you think I'm kind when I'm in a good mood or I'm kind after I have coffee, then you
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:52.160]   are limiting yourself and stressful situations may put you over the edge and you may not
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:01:01.480]   even realize how little control you have over your emotions in those times.
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.600]   Hello and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading your life,
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.160]   money and travel.
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.920]   I'm Chris Hutchins and I want to tell a little bit of a story before I get into today's conversation.
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:18.760]   In the 1960s, six boys from Tonga were shipwrecked on a remote Pacific island for 15 months.
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.880]   And you might be thinking it turned into something like Lord of the Flies, a descent into violence,
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.360]   but that is not what happened.
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.520]   In fact, it was the polar opposite of that novel, which most of us had to read in school.
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.960]   And while in the fictitional book, boys descended into anarchy, murder, mayhem, in the real
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.900]   world, they actually got along well, they developed structure, they took care of those
[00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.760]   who were injured.
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.320]   And when they were found after 15 months, they were doing great.
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.320]   They were fit.
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.320]   They were healthy.
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.820]   Now, why is this book Lord of Rings or sorry, Lord of the Flies so much bleaker than reality?
[00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.600]   Why did kindness end up actually ruling in real life?
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:02.160]   Well, author Rucker Berman introduced this story and others in a recent book called Humankind,
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.160]   A Hopeful History.
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.320]   And he makes the case pretty convincingly that humans are basically kind and they do
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.840]   better and thrive when they are kind.
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.880]   And that kindness is more human of a trait than cruelty.
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.560]   So if we can do better when we're kind, how do you hone and improve that ability?
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.680]   Well, that thought had me so intrigued by the title of Adrienne Bankert's book, Your
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.800]   Hidden Superpower, the kindness that makes you unbeatable at work and connects you with
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.800]   anyone.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.080]   And I'm so excited to be talking about it today.
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.240]   Adrienne is an Emmy Award winning journalist who's reported on stories from all over the
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.920]   world, interviewed hundreds of people and celebrities.
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.360]   She was a correspondent and weekend anchor on ABC's Good Morning America.
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.240]   And she's the first woman of color to solo host a morning show as host of Morning in
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.240]   America.
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.240]   But her hallmark is kindness.
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:53.080]   And it's been a huge factor in her success and ultimately led her to write her book.
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.760]   Adrienne, welcome to the show.
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.920]   And thank you so much for being here.
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.240]   Thank you, Chris.
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.480]   Great story.
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.360]   It's funny because it's not always true.
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.520]   I recently interviewed a guy named Brandon Presser, who's a travel journalist.
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.820]   And he wrote about the Pitcairn Islands, which is quite more of the Lord of the Rings truth,
[00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:17.180]   but also was much older people escaping tyranny and a little bit crazier.
[00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.020]   So I just want to start and read the first first kind of part of the first chapter of
[00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.660]   your book, because I think it sets the stone for a conversation, which is there is an unbeatable
[00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:32.300]   superpower inside every one of us that is far greater than talent or tenacity.
[00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.220]   And supersedes strength and intelligence.
[00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.900]   It crushes selfishness, negativity, and doubt.
[00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.020]   That's kindness you're speaking of.
[00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.260]   And that superpower is something I really want to understand.
[00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.860]   Could you just jump in and explain how it's a superpower that could do all of those things?
[00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.820]   Well, you know, I gave a keynote speech just recently here.
[00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:57.340]   And my title of the speech was "The Purpose of Your Power."
[00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:03.300]   You know, I think that people forget that kindness isn't just a pleasant thing to do.
[00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.120]   It's not just good etiquette.
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.740]   It's not just the way we should behave as if, you know, we're completely oblivious to
[00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.240]   the world going sideways around us.
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.380]   But it's a choice.
[00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.300]   It's a very intentional choice.
[00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:20.860]   And the purpose behind it is to provide stability to other people.
[00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:26.100]   Right now, we're in the midst of a very uncertain time in multiple areas.
[00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.820]   Just turn on the news.
[00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.100]   And a lot of people are going through personal battles that we don't even know about.
[00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.080]   And inside of them, they're just hoping that somebody will be kind to them, that somebody
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.940]   will remember them, that somebody will call them and tell them it's okay.
[00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.860]   And I think that a lot of times with kindness, we think, "Oh, I've got to try really hard
[00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:45.860]   to be a good person."
[00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.740]   Or, "Oh, you know, I've got to give these people a break and be nice to them."
[00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:56.020]   And it's funny because I don't know that I, now that I've, you know, kind of worked on
[00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:01.120]   kindness for a while, I don't know that I would say it's inherently who we want to be
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.120]   as people.
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:07.300]   You know, I think that a lot of times we want to just get the quick fix or we can be selfish.
[00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.100]   But I think it's the thing that we all crave to receive from other people.
[00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:17.620]   And so, when we give people the one thing that we universally want, somebody to be kind
[00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:23.740]   to us, somebody to treat us in a humane fashion, someone to think of us, to remember us, to
[00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:30.300]   be friendly to us, then the power behind that is that not only does that person get helped,
[00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.820]   but we become inspired, we become encouraged, we become more of the person that we really
[00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:40.140]   do desire to be, but don't always act in alignment with.
[00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:44.860]   And so, I think there's something very powerful about giving someone the consideration that
[00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.780]   has a mutual reciprocity that has that power to put us in a better mood and them in a better
[00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.900]   mood and do more than that.
[00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:56.660]   Really give oxygen to our lungs and keep us going and not quitting.
[00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:58.420]   And is it somewhat self-fulfilling?
[00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:02.700]   If it feels hard to start practicing this more and more regularly, is it something that
[00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.860]   as you do it, and you see the reaction becomes easier?
[00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:06.860]   I don't think it's hard.
[00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.140]   That's the thing.
[00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:12.580]   It's really not hard.
[00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:17.740]   Just the 15 times in the recent history that you were in a environment with somebody, maybe
[00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:24.300]   you were interviewing them on your podcast and they said something in error and you could
[00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:29.420]   have corrected them, whether it's their grammar or a fact, you know, they were just factually
[00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:32.500]   in error because they were talking very fast.
[00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.820]   And instead of correcting them, you just let them talk.
[00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:40.220]   And eventually over the process of listening, they actually were able to spit out the sentence
[00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:45.540]   in a way that you could edit around it without having to super critique them in that moment.
[00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:47.100]   That's an act of kindness.
[00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:48.260]   I don't think it's hard.
[00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.860]   I just think it's a choice.
[00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.160]   I work in a live studio environment.
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:58.060]   And so there are times when you want it to be a little quieter on the set, but you know,
[00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:01.460]   as the host of the show, that's not my job to make it quieter on the set.
[00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:04.220]   It's the stage director's job to make it quieter on the set.
[00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:09.900]   So my kindness is keeping myself in my lane and trusting that other person to do their
[00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:13.540]   job instead of thinking, "God, I wish somebody would do their job."
[00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:18.120]   That's a kindness, you know, deciding to trust somebody.
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:23.060]   So I think it's really more of, you know what, I'm going to stay calm in this moment.
[00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:26.460]   And right now that's at a premium.
[00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:28.500]   You know, there are a lot of people who blow up.
[00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:29.500]   There are a lot of people...
[00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:33.860]   I just looked up the word stability, and I think one of my favorite definitions from
[00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:39.660]   Merriam-Webster's dictionary is not radioactive, you know, not spontaneously radioactive.
[00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:45.700]   Like a lot of people can blow up easily, whether it's rush hour traffic or it's at their kids
[00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:50.300]   or their spouse or partner, and it's like, everybody's kind of asking for a chill pill
[00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:51.300]   right now.
[00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:54.700]   You know, like, can you please just keep it chill?
[00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:56.900]   And we want that for ourselves.
[00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:00.820]   So if we can put ourselves in somebody else's shoes and use that empathy that we use that
[00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:04.580]   word so often now, but it really is about putting ourselves in the position of somebody
[00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:05.580]   else.
[00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:07.860]   We can think, you know what, I can keep my mouth shut for five minutes.
[00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:10.860]   And then just in terms of like, you know, everyday life, going to the grocery store,
[00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:16.300]   going to pick up your kids from school, like there's always going to be some interruption.
[00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:18.900]   Can you just hold on for five minutes?
[00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:20.780]   Can you just hold on for one hour?
[00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:23.860]   Can you just hold on until you get off at 5pm?
[00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:27.060]   Yes, most of us can.
[00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:28.060]   And that's the kindness.
[00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:30.620]   It's the choice to hold on.
[00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:35.700]   Just take it day by day, take it hour by hour, take it every 15 minutes if you have to.
[00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:39.340]   That choice is something once we put it in bite-sized pieces becomes very easy.
[00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:41.820]   I think we all want to do this.
[00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:46.060]   I have a few times in my history where I'm sure I've been on that, the kind of giving
[00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:49.060]   side of an annoying kind of blow up in an argument.
[00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:52.780]   And after the fact, I'm like, "Gosh, I wish I just paused and took a break."
[00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:54.940]   But in the moment, it's much harder.
[00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:59.380]   Is there a practice or something to think about that makes it top of mind for you?
[00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:03.020]   I don't have my other cell phone near me, but it says hot mic on it.
[00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:05.780]   And this is my easy way to do this.
[00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:09.780]   Imagine that the person or persons next to you all have their cell phone out and they're
[00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:13.660]   going to roll on you in the next few minutes.
[00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:16.860]   And so, your reaction is potentially going to go viral.
[00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:21.420]   Now, I'm not trying to use a scare tactic, but it's that thought of there's going to
[00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:24.340]   be video proof of how I behave.
[00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:28.660]   Now, I have to live with that reality every single day.
[00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:33.220]   But if we all acted like we were on national television, that to me is just enough of a
[00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:37.060]   trigger for me to think, "Wait, just wait a second.
[00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:41.660]   Would I want this on video and would I want this on TikTok all around the world?
[00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:42.660]   No, not so much.
[00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:44.700]   So, let me just chill."
[00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:45.700]   That helps me.
[00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:47.540]   I hope that helps somebody else out there.
[00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:52.260]   No, I think the kind of subtle reminders, whether they're post-its you put on your computer
[00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:56.820]   screen or whether they're changing your background on your phone, those kinds of like little
[00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:59.380]   tricks I think sometimes help people.
[00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:04.580]   And what I meant earlier was once you start doing it more regularly, maybe it actually
[00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:05.580]   becomes easier.
[00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:06.580]   Oh, yeah.
[00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:11.660]   I think Nir Eyal, who wrote a book called Indistractable, kind of says, "Hey, whenever
[00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:17.420]   you're feeling that urge to go pick up your phone and check Instagram or Twitter or TikTok,
[00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:22.060]   pause for a second and just feel what it feels like to want to go do that."
[00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:24.440]   And maybe at the beginning, you just still go do it.
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:30.340]   But the more you understand, "Oh, that's the internal feeling of I'm having this desire
[00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:34.660]   to do something that I know is bad for me, that I know I don't want to do."
[00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:37.940]   Step one is feel what it feels like so you can work on recognizing it.
[00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:41.980]   Yeah, I think we do need to get more in touch with the feeling, whether it's positive or
[00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:42.980]   negative.
[00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:45.260]   I mean, it's just like, "Okay, what am I processing right now?
[00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:49.860]   What's going on in my head that's making me want to either blow up or run away?"
[00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:54.980]   Because a lot of us have a fight or flight tendency just in our DNA.
[00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:59.580]   And it's like, rather than have conflict, even if we don't mind a conflict, we would
[00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:01.220]   rather just walk out.
[00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:02.900]   And we can't always do that.
[00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:07.820]   And so having a word that calms you down, having a song that you sing...
[00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:12.980]   And I think if you can come up with some little mini mantras so that when things do get tense,
[00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:14.660]   innocuous mantras.
[00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:19.540]   There was a gentleman that I worked with and I got a little bit heated with at one
[00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:20.540]   point.
[00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:23.460]   And I said, "Listen," I said, "I apologize because I could have come off a lot kinder
[00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:24.460]   there."
[00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:29.780]   I said, "If you ever notice me getting that way, and maybe you think I haven't noticed,
[00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:33.500]   I want you to signal me, and this is how you're going to signal me.
[00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:35.300]   I want you to say, 'Jalapeno.'"
[00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:40.620]   And I said, "Jalapeno is the code word between you and me that things are getting a little
[00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:43.420]   too hot in here and we need to turn it down a notch."
[00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:44.420]   And he laughed out loud.
[00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:51.040]   I mean, it was just like a fun, innocuous way to remind ourselves not to get too irritated
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:53.680]   or not to get too spicy with one another.
[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:55.500]   So it worked.
[00:11:55.500 --> 00:12:01.340]   I just did a run with Robin Arzon from Peloton and they have these outdoor runs.
[00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:05.020]   And she has a similar thing where she's like, "Pick a word when you're running.
[00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:07.060]   And anytime it's hard, just repeat the word."
[00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:09.420]   And for her, it was "Outlast".
[00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:14.740]   And I found that -- I'm not training for a marathon or anything -- but I am trying to
[00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:17.060]   beat my records every time I run.
[00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:20.420]   And that idea of having a word that you just kind of, whether you repeat it to someone
[00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:23.500]   or to yourself, I found personally to be really helpful.
[00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:24.620]   I probably stole her word.
[00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:25.820]   I probably should come up with my own.
[00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:30.880]   But "Outlast" seemed like a good word to remind yourself when trying to compete or complete
[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:31.880]   a physical challenge.
[00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:32.880]   Yeah.
[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:37.460]   Well, and really, deciding to be kind in a world that can be very unkind is as physical
[00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:38.460]   as it gets.
[00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:43.620]   You know, I mean, you will have a visceral response sometimes to pressure and stress.
[00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:45.860]   And being kind is the last thing you want to do.
[00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:51.060]   You either want to tell somebody what you really think or you want to get the heck out.
[00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:57.480]   And I mean, I think that I didn't write the book to have some utopian idea of, "Oh, let's
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:00.020]   just all just be really sweet to each other."
[00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:06.820]   I wrote it because I wanted people to start seeing themselves as kind as an identity,
[00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:07.820]   not as an act.
[00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:11.620]   Because whatever you believe you are is what you'll attract.
[00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:15.460]   But also, whatever you believe you are, you will stay true to even if you mess up.
[00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:20.620]   Even if you stumble, you're going to return back to that baseline of who you see yourself
[00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:21.620]   as.
[00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:26.820]   So, if you see yourself as kind, not just somebody who can be kind, but your full identity
[00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:31.540]   as a person is kind, then you can come back to send her.
[00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:33.300]   That will be your North Star.
[00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:38.700]   If you think, "I'm kind when I'm in a good mood" or "I'm kind after I have coffee", then
[00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:44.460]   you are limiting yourself and stressful situations may put you over the edge and you may not
[00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:49.340]   even realize how little control you have over your emotions in those times.
[00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:53.680]   Sometimes the things that you might say don't necessarily come off as kind.
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:59.600]   And I'll give a fun example, which was I interviewed a guy named Mike Hayes, who was a former Navy
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:04.760]   SEAL commander, and he was giving a lecture and a student asked a question that was one
[00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:09.780]   of those questions that was kind of annoying, where they are trying to tell the whole room
[00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:12.760]   how great they are before they ask the question.
[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:17.260]   And his response was, "Hey, I'm going to pause you and tell you you're a bad question asker.
[00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:21.640]   And in the moment, you're probably feeling really small, but otherwise I'm going to let
[00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:24.980]   you go on through life asking questions terribly and have all these people..."
[00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:29.760]   So he meant it in the nicest way, but it certainly is sometimes hard for those things to come
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:31.040]   across kind.
[00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:32.640]   How do you balance that?
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:38.480]   I think that a lot of times kindness does get this like wrap of, "Oh, it has to be said
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:42.720]   in the most sugary sweet way, otherwise it's not kind."
[00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:47.440]   When the truth of the matter is, is sometimes tough love really is truly love.
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:52.400]   You know, sometimes being kind looks like criticism, but it's the best thing you could
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:53.400]   do.
[00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:56.200]   It's the best thing you could do in your life over the course of your career or over the
[00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:59.460]   course of your relationships, because that'll be the reality check.
[00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:02.280]   I mean, I can't tell you how many times when somebody gets got...
[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:05.840]   Not got in my face like in a confrontational way, because there's a difference between
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:12.060]   confronting and offering constructive feedback, but just told me like, "Listen, A, I got to
[00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:15.440]   tell you the truth because I don't know that anybody else will."
[00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:19.440]   And it was just like a lifesaver of information.
[00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:22.480]   But there aren't a lot of people who are that honest.
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:28.880]   And if they don't love you or care about you, if they don't have that desire to make you
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:32.180]   better, then they'll just let you keep doing what you're doing.
[00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:36.400]   But if they are kind enough to be super upfront with you and to tell you something that will
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:40.480]   actually help you be better and be who you really want to be, then that's absolutely
[00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:43.480]   kind even if the delivery stings a little bit.
[00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:47.160]   There's a book that I read when I was running a company called Radical Candor.
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:52.120]   And it kind of highlights that if you don't build the relationship for someone to know
[00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:57.060]   that that feedback comes from a good place, then even if your intentions are good, it's
[00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:59.360]   probably not going to land on the delivery.
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:04.240]   So you have to spend time cultivating the relationship for someone to say, "Oh, they're
[00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:08.520]   probably trying to help me improve when they tell me that the work I just delivered was
[00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:09.520]   terrible."
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:12.320]   And I think that too, there's two kinds of people in this world.
[00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:15.960]   For the majority of people that you are going to have to nurture that relationship before
[00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:17.880]   you can be that honest with them.
[00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:23.880]   But there is a small, I would say a radically small group of people who can handle that
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:29.360]   kind of honesty and frankness like you're talking about, no matter how it's delivered,
[00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:31.080]   because they're so hungry.
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:35.600]   Like the hungriest hunters, the people who are so teachable, the ones who are willing
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:39.240]   to pay the highest price, and there's more than one person on the planet who thinks like
[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:43.680]   that, they will take it however they can get it because their ultimate goals are higher
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:45.680]   than their feelings.
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:49.080]   And they're not going to let sensitivity stop them from growing.
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:51.160]   Does it sometimes hurt still?
[00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:52.160]   Absolutely.
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:57.620]   But I would think that the top 1% of people had to put their feelings aside in order to
[00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:03.360]   grow through those painful experiences that looked like an insult, but really was like
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:06.360]   the billion-dollar idea to their success.
[00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:09.960]   I don't know if I necessarily want to put myself into that when you called it the top
[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:12.560]   percent, but I do love feedback.
[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:17.680]   And I find that people in general don't like giving it because they know they are kind
[00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:20.480]   and they want people to feel good.
[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:24.880]   But for me, sometimes it most comes around when I'm cooking, and I'll make something
[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:27.040]   for dinner, and I serve it to everyone.
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:28.040]   They're like, "This was so good."
[00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:29.040]   I'm like, "Great.
[00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:30.040]   Thank you.
[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:31.600]   I appreciate that you enjoy it.
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:36.120]   But what could I do so that when I make this dish next time, it's even better?"
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:41.000]   And I find it so difficult to pull out the criticism from people.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:47.120]   So if we reverse this, any tips for someone trying to seek criticism in a world where
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:48.960]   sometimes people don't like giving it?
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:52.920]   Well, I think number one is I would use a more real-life situation than you're cooking.
[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:54.840]   Because I think cooking...
[00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:59.800]   As much as you probably love the idea of just cooking, I want to ask you, have you ever
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:05.520]   been in a situation where you knew that this person was wiser than you, more experienced
[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:10.440]   than you, wealthier than you, and you knew that you could learn and glean from them,
[00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:14.160]   but you didn't know what to ask to get them to be really upfront?
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:17.440]   Have you ever been in that situation?
[00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:18.760]   I mean, I'm sure I have.
[00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:25.920]   Because an example doesn't come to mind, but sometimes I've interviewed people who have
[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:31.680]   their own successful podcasts or TV shows with the goal at the end.
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:34.840]   And I plan to do this with you, but we're a little bit of the ways in.
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:41.480]   And ask for feedback on my ability to interview, on my running an interview.
[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:43.520]   And I haven't gotten a lot of feedback.
[00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:45.200]   People are kind of like, "Oh, you did a great job.
[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.200]   Good job."
[00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:47.400]   And I'm like, "No, thank you.
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:49.920]   But I know that you've done this more than me.
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:52.460]   I know there's something I can learn from you."
[00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:55.040]   And I find it difficult to pull that out sometimes.
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:59.440]   I think that number one thing I would do is I'd take myself out of it and I'd say, "What
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:01.120]   would you tell?"
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:03.280]   And then I would give a category.
[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:10.160]   Young entrepreneurs or whatever definition of the category of people that you place yourself
[00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:12.960]   in and say, "What would you tell?"
[00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:17.080]   Or "What would you tell your 20-something or 30-something self?"
[00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:18.800]   Start there.
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:26.320]   And then the next question is, "I'm giving you permission to be really direct with me.
[00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:30.540]   What would you say that I should take away from this conversation?"
[00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:31.540]   And see what they say.
[00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:37.440]   Now, again, a lot of the smartest people in the room can be very blunt, but they might
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:40.520]   want to know that they nurtured a relationship.
[00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:42.040]   They don't want to hurt anybody's feelings.
[00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:47.040]   They've learned, like you said, a long time ago, that it doesn't pay to make somebody
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:50.480]   feel lousy right after they just met you.
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:52.240]   First impression, right?
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:56.860]   But when they are able to kind of make a broader stroke and it's not so personal, like what
[00:19:56.860 --> 00:20:03.160]   can you do, then it actually lands better because you can apply it not only for your
[00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:06.480]   life, but you can talk to anybody in your peer group and give them the same piece of
[00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:07.480]   wisdom.
[00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:12.240]   I just learned that a lot of people don't really want the truth.
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:15.280]   You can't handle the truth.
[00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:17.600]   And so it's like, "I want to be kind to you.
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:18.600]   I want to help you."
[00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:25.680]   But it requires that you almost kind of have it coming out of your eyeballs and your pores.
[00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:31.000]   That I am so hungry to learn and be a student of this moment and be a student of life and
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.240]   be a student of those who are more advanced than me, that I can hear anything.
[00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:39.040]   And you can say that to your blue in the face, but unless you're really admitting it, unless
[00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:43.240]   you're really sending it out into the universe, they can smell that.
[00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:44.640]   It's like they can smell fear.
[00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:47.280]   Well, I can promise you that I am in that camp.
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:52.200]   But before we wrap this conversation, be thinking about anything I could be doing because you
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:57.000]   have 10 times the experience or maybe 100 than I do.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.620]   But before I ask you that, I want to know, can people ever be too kind?
[00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:06.840]   Can there be a circumstance where there's just too much kindness in a room in a conversation?
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:09.560]   No, because kindness and niceness are different.
[00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:11.120]   I think you can be too nice.
[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:15.040]   I think you can be, again, afraid to hurt somebody's feelings, afraid to make a bad
[00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:20.920]   impression, fearful of anything will cause you to compromise your standards and compromise
[00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:21.920]   who you really are.
[00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:26.080]   But I think that being kind means kind of being self-aware and at the same time being
[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:30.400]   very, very aware of other people and knowing what maybe they could handle, what the room
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:31.400]   could bear.
[00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:34.440]   Again, reading the room is so key.
[00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:39.000]   In speaking to a group recently, there were two big meetings and I could have given the
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.160]   same speech twice, like nobody would have complained.
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:43.520]   The first speech was great.
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:48.000]   I could have just hit replay on my memory and busted out this extemporaneous speech
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.400]   and probably had a better delivery because I've already done it once before in front
[00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:53.080]   of a live audience, right?
[00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:56.360]   But there was the gentleman who was kind of escorting me through my different stops and
[00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:57.360]   he said, "Wow."
[00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:58.760]   He was like, "You didn't give a cookie cutter message.
[00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:00.320]   I said different room, different need."
[00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:04.480]   I was like, "You have to know what the room will bear."
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:09.320]   And until you learn to read a room, until you can kind of get a feel, there's one way
[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:14.320]   to read the room by actually going around and kind of surveying people like before the
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:21.080]   event starts and shaking hands and kind of networking and breezing through and kind of
[00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:25.160]   getting a little focus group going of the experiences of the different people that you've
[00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:26.160]   met.
[00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:31.280]   You can make a judgment based on the age of the average attendee, but eventually you get
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:37.800]   practiced in discerning what it is that a room actually is looking for.
[00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:39.880]   Why am I really there?
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:44.760]   You know, some of that is research and development, but otherwise that's actually like time and
[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:50.560]   experience and tenure of going and speaking to crowds and learning about people and human
[00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:53.560]   engagement and just being fully present.
[00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:58.240]   And that comes through kindness because when I'm kind, I'm so aware of the other people
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:04.960]   around me that I almost have what I call in the book a sixth sense, you know, an intuition
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:08.360]   that helps me to understand people better.
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:12.640]   Is there an example of a time where you read the room and it kind of altered what you were
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:15.240]   going to say or how you're going to say it that you could share?
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:16.240]   Yeah.
[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:20.480]   I gave a speech and I thought I was going to talk about just kindness as your superpower.
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:26.560]   You know, let me just give the delivery of my book and you know, I'll give a couple examples
[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:29.120]   and I'll have fun.
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:31.160]   But I just got really quiet.
[00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:35.780]   And when you're quiet to me and you hear this from all the top minds and thought leaders
[00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:42.360]   in the world, is that that quiet time can be so creative and so able to tap you kind
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:44.640]   of in to the space that you need to be in.
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:49.840]   I think that so that you can discern, but I ended up getting a word, just one single
[00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:53.560]   word of what this group needed.
[00:23:53.560 --> 00:24:00.800]   And I went into the room and I'm listening to the beginning parts of the awards program.
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:06.400]   And at one point they're honoring somebody who died and at one point they're honoring
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:12.760]   somebody who was in the ICU and there's tears and they're crying on the stage right before
[00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:15.400]   I'm about to give my big speech.
[00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:22.040]   And I was like, I'm so glad I got quiet because the word that I'd gotten and the situation
[00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:28.040]   that I was in caused me to connect the dots in a different way when I delivered that speech.
[00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:31.720]   Because there's one, you know, you can go into a room and you can be really fun and
[00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:38.400]   engaging and exciting, but they were all very emotional and a bit raw.
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:42.860]   And so they needed encouragement, but they didn't need it in a rah rah sis boom bah kind
[00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:44.240]   of way.
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:48.000]   And so reading the room for me meant being quiet enough to kind of tap in where I was
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.160]   paying attention.
[00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:55.000]   It's not like I'm a psychic, but because I was calm in myself, again, what was the first
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.400]   thing I said at the top of the interview, everybody's asking us to just take a big chill
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:00.400]   pill.
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:06.400]   But if I'm super high on like my wavelength of, I got to deliver a really good speech,
[00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:11.280]   I'm not going to be cool and chill and calm enough in myself to be actually paying attention
[00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:15.360]   to the room when they're crying on stage, I'm going to go practice my speech, go over
[00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:20.000]   my notes, order another drink if I do that before I speak.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:25.400]   Just being present enough to listen to the program versus thinking, I'm too busy to listen
[00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:26.400]   to the program.
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:27.400]   I'm good.
[00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:29.840]   I know how to jump on a stage and give a talk.
[00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:34.320]   That would have been a big mistake on my part, but because I listened to them, because I
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:40.520]   had been quiet in my own private time, I could now tailor my delivery in a way that landed
[00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:45.480]   and people came up to me afterwards, thanking me for what I shared because it hit home for
[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:46.480]   them.
[00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:48.800]   But I was in tune with the room and I was listening to them.
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:52.600]   I mean, obviously, reading the room is the big hack in that conversation.
[00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:55.680]   But 2 other things I took away, which I'm curious to hear your reaction.
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:58.740]   So one, be prepared.
[00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:03.680]   So I want to talk in a second about the kinds of preparation you do before you're delivering
[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:04.680]   a...
[00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:08.600]   Whether for you, it might be a keynote presentation, but for many people, it might just be a presentation
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:11.960]   at work or an important conversation with friends or family.
[00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:17.380]   And the other, which I'm interpreting as a hack might be, if you're giving a presentation
[00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:22.960]   in a work meeting, volunteer to not go first, so that you have a chance to read the room,
[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:26.960]   how they might react to another presentation so you can tailor that delivery.
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:29.560]   Well, I mean, I was the only speaker.
[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:30.560]   I was the keynote.
[00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:31.560]   So it was me.
[00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:32.560]   You didn't have a choice.
[00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:33.560]   I didn't have a choice.
[00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:37.280]   And when I spoke, but I think that one key would be...
[00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:43.040]   When I arrive at a destination, one way to prepare is to go early.
[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:47.880]   And reading the room can be reading the tense moments that happen while they're putting
[00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:52.640]   the dishes on the table or while they're setting up the PowerPoint slide.
[00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:58.920]   You can capture a little bit of reading the room by seeing how stressed out or calm or
[00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:03.520]   fun the staff is prior to the audience even arriving.
[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:06.120]   Because I think all of that plays into it.
[00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:13.440]   And one of my favorite interviews of all time was Lady Gaga, Sam Elliot.
[00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:16.600]   Why can't I think of the other names?
[00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:18.360]   The Star is Born cast.
[00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:19.360]   Bradley Cooper.
[00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:20.360]   Bradley Cooper.
[00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:21.760]   I was like, "Of course, Bradley Cooper.
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:26.120]   How do I forget Bradley Cooper?"
[00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:28.440]   But I was setting up for that Star is Born interview.
[00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:32.280]   And I remember getting in the room very early.
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:35.920]   And the first person to enter the room and the second person and how they entered the
[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:40.480]   room was very significant because they didn't all come together.
[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:44.280]   But just being present and knowing what my crew was going through and knowing what the
[00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:48.720]   publicity team was feeling like, because there was a little bit of tension because it's always
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:52.940]   tense because they're dealing with these people who have to go through all these different
[00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:55.200]   interviews in succession.
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:28:01.480]   But I remember sitting in the room and thinking our chairs were too far apart.
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:04.840]   So I asked the crew, I said, "Can you move the chairs a little closer?"
[00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:07.520]   Well, we did.
[00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:12.560]   Then after the whole thing was done, everybody loved the interview, big success.
[00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:18.100]   One person who wasn't even on that team contacted me and said, "I want to give you some feedback.
[00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:21.640]   I think the chairs should have been closer."
[00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:25.800]   So I was reading the room correctly in terms of preparing.
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:28.360]   That's something that anybody, whether you're giving a keynote or you're doing something
[00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:31.120]   at work, you want to think about the furniture.
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:34.480]   You want to think about how close you're going to be to the table if it's in a conference
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:35.560]   room area.
[00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:38.320]   Are you going to move around the room?
[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:41.680]   Are you going to have somebody else operate your presentation in the clicker or are you
[00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:43.040]   going to do that yourself?
[00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:49.960]   All of those things lead to you feeling more prepared with the choreography of the conversation.
[00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:51.840]   And it takes a lot of stress off of you.
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:57.360]   It's not controlling the whole situation, but it's again, you want to read the room,
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:02.800]   but you also want to have some sense of preparing it yourself and creating atmosphere in the
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:07.640]   room, because that will help you actually channel the right vibes when people do sit
[00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:10.040]   down to hear you speak.
[00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:14.500]   One counterintuitive thing that I've done is that I like to really prepare if I'm giving
[00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:20.160]   a talk to the point that I know exactly what I want to say on every slide and all that.
[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:21.840]   And some people say, "Well, but then it's inscripted."
[00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:23.360]   And I say, "No."
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:27.480]   Actually going through knowing exactly what I would say in a perfect scenario makes it
[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:32.440]   really easy for me to diverge in the moment to do anything.
[00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:36.920]   And so, it's less memorizing a script and repeating the script as much as like memorizing
[00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:41.000]   every point I want to get across so I'm free to move around.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:46.440]   How do you think about preparing for a big meeting or a conversation or a talk?
[00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:49.440]   I really flow a lot.
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:50.560]   You know, I think about it.
[00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:53.760]   I was in high school when I started doing speech contests.
[00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:58.200]   And my coach would literally untie my tennis shoes while I was talking while he was timing
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:00.840]   me to be as close to 10 minutes as possible.
[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:06.320]   Throw toilet paper across, you know, maybe even throw toilet paper rolls at me.
[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:11.640]   It was all very gentle, nothing abusive, but it was all to distract me while I was giving
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:17.920]   this talk and sounding pitch perfect while getting as close to 10 minutes as possible.
[00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:24.880]   So over the years, I've gone from memorizing my entire script verbatim, which I can still
[00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:26.440]   do to this day.
[00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:29.400]   I've done it with breaking news when I worked for ABC.
[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:33.240]   You know, somebody gives me a story and I have to go live in four minutes and I can
[00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:39.600]   literally memorize the entire 40 second script or minute 30 script that I'm going to do.
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:43.880]   But now extemporaneously, I can memorize.
[00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:50.400]   If I type it out and literally write out the speech, I can pretty much gather in my head
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:52.320]   what the main points are.
[00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:59.480]   It won't come off exactly verbatim, but it's so close to what I put on paper.
[00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:01.720]   You have to know your strengths.
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:04.660]   Not everybody can memorize like that.
[00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:09.960]   Not everybody will work well if they're just flowing between bullet points written on cue
[00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:11.240]   cards.
[00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:14.240]   So if what you're doing works for you, keep doing it.
[00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:18.560]   But if you want to step it up to another level, maybe try a different delivery style, record
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:21.680]   yourself on video at home where you don't have to worry about the pressure of actually
[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:24.240]   doing it in real life and see how it comes off.
[00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:28.240]   And then have a mentor or somebody who's a more experienced speaker than you take a look
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:34.760]   at it and say, "Hey, I wanted you to give me your honest feedback about my delivery."
[00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:37.560]   I don't think there's a wrong or right way to do it.
[00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:43.160]   I just think that when you've been speaking for 20 years, you're going to come off differently
[00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:45.080]   than if you've been speaking for five.
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:49.600]   Even if you're an excellent speaker, if you try a different method, you know, the different
[00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:53.440]   methods actually will show you your strengths.
[00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:54.440]   What about...
[00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:58.560]   Oh, I just kicked a trash can.
[00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:03.060]   Just trying to throw you off your game.
[00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:06.400]   For the last few years, I know a lot of us have been working remotely.
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:07.780]   I know that's changing.
[00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:10.560]   But for some people, that's probably the new normal.
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:15.860]   And I'm curious what kinds of lessons you've either applied or people could take away for
[00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:21.280]   how to work on their delivery of important conversations, work on their interaction with
[00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:26.600]   teammates, colleagues, when they're looking at a computer screen and not able to walk
[00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:31.600]   around the room, or maybe not read the room as easily as you would be able to in person.
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:35.000]   Treat your Zoom calls like FaceTime.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.080]   We have way more fun on Instagram Live and FaceTime sometimes.
[00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:43.340]   And then as soon as we get into Zoom mode or whatever it is, whatever platform your
[00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:48.520]   office uses, it's like, "Let me stay in this very tight little box and not move and
[00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:50.080]   have very little body language."
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:54.380]   And it's like, no, lean into the screen, get in there.
[00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:59.400]   Don't be afraid of you looking distorted or looking silly.
[00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:00.480]   Move your body around.
[00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:02.640]   Don't just be a head and shoulders.
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:05.880]   People don't even like seeing that on television anymore.
[00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:09.920]   They want to see you kind of jump it through the screen and just be personable.
[00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:13.900]   And selfie mode your Zoom meeting.
[00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:19.340]   Not the whole time, but use the different tools that we have at our disposal.
[00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:25.060]   If it's your laptop, be like, "Hey guys, I'm just getting back to my desk," and make it
[00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:28.620]   a funny moment, loosen up.
[00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:33.420]   And I think that people will stay more engaged because I frankly think it gets really stale
[00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:37.020]   when we're all just looking like we're in our perfect little box.
[00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:40.400]   That's my first big tip and one that I hope lasts and sticks with you.
[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:46.880]   I remember early in the pandemic, for no particular reason, I bought a bunch of party glasses
[00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:51.480]   on Amazon just so that whenever we started a meeting, it was like, "Could we break the
[00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:53.260]   ice in a different way?"
[00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:55.760]   And so that was one thing I tried to do.
[00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:58.480]   I bought those mullet wigs at one point.
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:03.120]   I feel like some of that's phased away and I'm like, "Maybe I need to go dust off that
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:05.760]   box in the storage room and bring it back out."
[00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:12.800]   Well, and I always am a big believer in the fact is the digital world is not going away.
[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:15.720]   The virtual meeting world is not going away.
[00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:19.100]   So how can we surprise people?
[00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:25.160]   Whether it's party glasses or you inbox the first five people to log on on time, because
[00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:29.440]   there's always inevitably the people who are late to these things and say, "Hey, guess
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:30.440]   what?"
[00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:33.640]   And then five minutes in, "We just wanted to let you know the first five people who got
[00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:36.400]   here got Starbucks gift cards.
[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:38.880]   And everybody else, we hope you'll be on time next time."
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:39.880]   Whatever.
[00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:42.000]   I mean, don't make them feel bad, but just like, "Guess what?
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.440]   There's a reward."
[00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:47.440]   And then have themes.
[00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:49.080]   Have a derby hat day.
[00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:51.080]   We just had the Kentucky Derby.
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:53.560]   Have a derby hat Zoom call for your meeting.
[00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:56.000]   I mean, you don't have to keep the hat on the whole time.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.120]   And then the fact is so many people stay on the photo, like they don't even go to the
[00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:01.120]   video anymore.
[00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:09.140]   I don't know if that's a rule that you have to, but we hide behind the photos a lot.
[00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:13.440]   And so it's like, how can I get people to not have the static image, but to actually
[00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:15.060]   let us into their home?
[00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:19.080]   If they're hiding behind the photo, chances are they're either really busy, their house
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:22.960]   is a mess, or they're stressed out and they just don't want to see anybody and they don't
[00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:24.800]   want anybody to see them.
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:28.680]   And so for me, it's like giving people fair warning, "Listen, no static images.
[00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:34.720]   We're going to do video and we're going to give a reward to the person with the best
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:36.320]   background."
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:40.520]   And then they can do their virtual fake background thing so that they don't feel the pressure
[00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:43.600]   that they have to have the most perfect house behind them.
[00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:46.960]   Like, "Oh my God, this is a contest of who has the best living room."
[00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:47.960]   No.
[00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:48.960]   Or the best kitchen.
[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:49.960]   No.
[00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:53.880]   I think that there is a lot of social anxiety right now over looking like everything's okay
[00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:55.880]   when it's not.
[00:35:55.880 --> 00:36:00.520]   And I think that if you're hiding, it's because you need somebody to call you and be kind
[00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:03.680]   to you and say, "Hey, how are you doing?
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:05.420]   Are you okay?"
[00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:09.440]   Which probably isn't the best thing to do in a group setting, but if you notice someone's
[00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:14.160]   kind of stepping away, maybe there's a really good opportunity after the meeting to reach
[00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:17.280]   out to that person, "Hey, noticed your background was off.
[00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:18.280]   How are you doing?
[00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:20.300]   Is everything cool?"
[00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:23.960]   Those kinds of subtle moments I found can add a lot of value in relationship building
[00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:26.640]   and in many other places.
[00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:30.560]   I think mental health should be in the spotlight all the time, especially after the past couple
[00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:31.560]   of years.
[00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:35.160]   You know, there's a lot of people who are doing great and their businesses are doing
[00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:39.800]   wonderful and there's so much opportunity, but I think there's a lot of people who have
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:44.800]   struggled with the past couple of years and so struggled to find connection in a tribe.
[00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:50.720]   I think people are just longing for interpersonal communication and in a way that's real and
[00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:54.480]   like meeting kind people and it's like, how can we help them?
[00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:57.760]   Well, first of all, if you're at work and you notice somebody's never showing their
[00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:03.360]   video, to me, that's a big fat red flag that they might long for some connection that they
[00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:08.320]   just don't have and they're isolating because they feel alone and they've disconnected from
[00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:12.000]   their family over the time, maybe because somebody's in a health battle and they can't
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.400]   go visit them because they are high risk.
[00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:19.840]   It's like we need to pay more attention and there's ways to do that first privately and
[00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:22.880]   then publicly just encourage people to check in on each other.
[00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:24.960]   So just make those appeals.
[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:28.320]   And if you're the manager, I would say, maybe try...
[00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:32.920]   If you're finding it hard to make every meeting exciting on video, maybe decide if there's
[00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:34.680]   some meetings that don't need to be.
[00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:38.320]   I find that we've gone overboard and now everything that could have been...
[00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:42.600]   Things that would have been phone calls 3 years ago are now all video meetings.
[00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:48.060]   And so, I schedule some phone calls a lot and then save video for a time where the face
[00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:51.840]   to face is more important because I don't know about you, you're on camera all day,
[00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:56.320]   but sometimes I'm exhausted just looking at a screen for hours on end.
[00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:57.320]   Yes.
[00:37:57.320 --> 00:37:58.320]   I'm with you.
[00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:05.120]   And it's like, I'm on video calls almost as long as I'm on TV every day.
[00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:10.520]   And you're just like, "Well, sometimes, frankly, I just want to wear this wrinkled t-shirt
[00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:17.400]   and have my hair in a bun and not care, but it wouldn't be the most professional expression
[00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:19.180]   of my highest and best self."
[00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:24.080]   So it's like, all the lines are so blurred that we just...
[00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:27.760]   Again, another expression of being kind and being professional and knowing how to treat
[00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:28.760]   each other.
[00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:32.320]   It's like, give each other a break.
[00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:33.320]   Just understand.
[00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:37.440]   Again, like you said, not every call deserves a video conference.
[00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:38.440]   Yes.
[00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:44.940]   I do think face to face is really helpful in building deeper relationships, building trust.
[00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:50.160]   There was a whole chapter in the book about building trust in seconds, which reminded
[00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:54.360]   me of the Dale Carnegie, how to win friends and influence people without the undertone
[00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:57.520]   of trying to influence other people to do something.
[00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:02.200]   But I'm curious how you would explain to someone hearing that and say, "Okay, wait, so I can
[00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:03.200]   build trust.
[00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:04.200]   I can be kind.
[00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:05.200]   What's the trick?
[00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:06.480]   How do I start doing that?"
[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:07.960]   Maybe with an example or two.
[00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:11.600]   The key is to become practiced, right?
[00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:17.240]   How often do you go out, whether it's Target or the dry cleaner, or to pick up some food
[00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:22.680]   and you don't speak to a single soul?
[00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:25.500]   It's kind of crazy and foreign to me.
[00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:31.000]   It's foreign to me that people go out and they never acknowledge, smile, make eye contact,
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.460]   strike up conversation with anybody.
[00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:36.300]   They just walk, get their stuff, walk back.
[00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:40.700]   In a world where we're craving connection, we can be apprehensive about interpersonal
[00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:46.360]   communications with strangers, which is interesting, but that's how you meet new people.
[00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:51.440]   So the first thing is just start to become more open.
[00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:52.440]   Really easy example.
[00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:58.900]   I was at the airline lounge or one of my recent trips and this woman walks in and says, "I
[00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:00.540]   love your shoes.
[00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:01.540]   Those are so cute."
[00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:02.540]   And I said, "Oh, thank you so much."
[00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:03.540]   And I told her where I got them.
[00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:05.620]   I told her a little story about them.
[00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:06.700]   "Oh, what's your name?
[00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:07.700]   Where are you traveling to?"
[00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:08.700]   "Oh, I'm going to Florida."
[00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:10.540]   I mean, you get all this information.
[00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:17.220]   We didn't exchange business cards, but in that moment, she felt comfortable just having
[00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:19.140]   a conversation with me.
[00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:21.820]   Another situation I had, I was out at a restaurant.
[00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:26.580]   I happened to go by myself, I was getting some food and the couple next to me strikes
[00:40:26.580 --> 00:40:30.300]   up a conversation, but I do that all over the place.
[00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:34.260]   So I'm not surprised when people want to strike up conversations with me out of nowhere because
[00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:36.580]   I literally do it all the time.
[00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:40.800]   And so it's like, once you're practiced in doing that, then somebody is going to strike
[00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:46.820]   up a conversation with you where they're going to build more on what they're going through,
[00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:50.980]   or they're going to ask you for something in their realm of business.
[00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:55.860]   And they're going to feel like they can trust you because you are actually showing genuine
[00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:56.860]   interest.
[00:40:56.860 --> 00:41:00.340]   The thing is you do not have genuine interest when you're born.
[00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:05.820]   You have to actually experiment with genuine interest as you become a grownup.
[00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:07.560]   And then as you are a grownup.
[00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:12.740]   And so as I'm curious about other people, I actually build trust with them.
[00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:16.260]   But that authenticity, people can smell when you're not authentic.
[00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:18.780]   People can smell when you're just trying to network and get a business card.
[00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:20.140]   Oh, do you have a card?
[00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:21.140]   Oh yeah.
[00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:22.460]   Oh, oh, you're in television.
[00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:25.820]   Oh, you know, I know somebody you should interview.
[00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:26.940]   That's fine.
[00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:31.220]   But the fact of the matter is, is that when you actually show that you care about somebody,
[00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:32.620]   then they feel safer with you.
[00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:33.620]   Oh, thank you so much.
[00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:36.700]   And thank you for that genuine concern that you have about my loved one because you end
[00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:42.100]   up talking about that kind of stuff on planes and in restaurants and in airline lounges
[00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:47.140]   with perfect strangers, because now you're practiced in showing that genuine interest
[00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:49.140]   with people.
[00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:52.700]   Now I'm sure you've been in a situation where maybe you didn't have that genuine interest.
[00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:54.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:55.620]   So how does that play out?
[00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:59.460]   Because I've definitely been in conversations and sometimes I'm too blunt, which I think
[00:41:59.460 --> 00:42:02.380]   can maybe be off-putting, but I'm like, "You know what?
[00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:07.100]   I feel like breaking off a conversation when there's no genuine interest to me is better
[00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:09.960]   than just sitting there and faking it."
[00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:14.540]   But neither path forward seems like it's the kindest path forward.
[00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:17.260]   So what do you do in that circumstance?
[00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:21.320]   A lot of my building trust with strangers is very quickly.
[00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:25.860]   It happens on planes or it can happen on social media.
[00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:29.980]   And there was two times on planes, once years ago and once most recently, that I was so
[00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:34.700]   exhausted, like I'd had two hours of sleep where I was looking at getting two hours of
[00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:38.100]   sleep before I had to be at work the next morning.
[00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:41.020]   And in the first instance, I was exhausted.
[00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:42.460]   I did not want to be there.
[00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:47.700]   I had to put a blanket over my head and I wanted to just knock out.
[00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:53.780]   And the person next to me had their food on the island in between the two of us and on
[00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:57.700]   the floor and was eating kind of loud.
[00:42:57.700 --> 00:42:59.780]   And I'm like, "No."
[00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:03.700]   And then I thought, "Gosh, I feel like I'm supposed to strike up a conversation with
[00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:07.500]   this person and I don't want to, I'm tired."
[00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:10.820]   And it ended up that I thought, "Well, why am I on this plane?"
[00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:14.140]   And this is a conversation I'm having inside of myself.
[00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:17.260]   Why am I on this plane sitting next to this person?
[00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:23.700]   This is a captive audience for 45 minutes, it's a short flight I was on.
[00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:29.420]   I could allow myself to give into my sleepiness, my fatigue, or I could be selfless in this
[00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:34.660]   moment and be kind and see if there's any reason why there's a once in a lifetime opportunity
[00:43:34.660 --> 00:43:36.540]   for me to know this person.
[00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:40.980]   I can hang on for 45 minutes, I can stay awake for that long.
[00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:45.780]   Ended up exchanging phone numbers, they ended up helping me later on in life.
[00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:46.780]   It was just amazing.
[00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:50.860]   If I would have missed that opportunity, I never would know.
[00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:55.500]   And it kind of marked my life because it's those times when you want to quit.
[00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:58.420]   It's those times when you want to just, "Please, I don't want to hear anybody.
[00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:02.260]   I'm going to put my headphones on and I'm going to block out the world."
[00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:06.460]   That's the time when you want to pay more attention, take your headphones off.
[00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:11.660]   Because inevitably, practice kindness leads to more kindness and more open doors.
[00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:16.140]   Practice selfishness, practice blocking out the world, practice isolation.
[00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:18.380]   I know that doesn't sound like...
[00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:21.180]   It's like, "Give me a break, Adrienne, you're telling me you never block."
[00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:22.180]   Yes, I do.
[00:44:22.180 --> 00:44:25.340]   But I don't know what I missed out on in that selfish moment.
[00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:27.740]   I don't know what I missed out on when I said, "You know what?
[00:44:27.740 --> 00:44:29.020]   I don't care.
[00:44:29.020 --> 00:44:32.380]   It's just me and I'm going to go to sleep, leave me alone."
[00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:36.900]   I've stopped saying the words, "Leave me alone," especially in light of the past couple of
[00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:38.060]   years.
[00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:41.140]   Because I think that there are a lot of people who wish that those words were never uttered
[00:44:41.140 --> 00:44:42.140]   out of their mouth.
[00:44:42.140 --> 00:44:46.540]   I never want to be alone again in terms of not being connected to other people.
[00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:48.300]   So yes, I think there's a fine line.
[00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:50.840]   Yes, I think that we all have our moments.
[00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:56.340]   But I really try to spur myself on, just like somebody who's running in a race and they're
[00:44:56.340 --> 00:44:59.260]   tired and they don't want to finish that race.
[00:44:59.260 --> 00:45:04.140]   Every time I sit on that plane and I'm sleepy, I think, "No, force yourself.
[00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:07.220]   Think about, 'Am I supposed to know this person?'"
[00:45:07.220 --> 00:45:09.500]   And if you have peace that says, "No, absolutely not."
[00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:13.140]   Like if your peace is like, "No, I'm good, take a nap," then take a nap by all means.
[00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:15.380]   I hope this makes sense to somebody.
[00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:18.420]   But I really don't like to miss opportunities.
[00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:22.700]   And I just think you're there for a reason, for a person.
[00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:25.340]   I'm with you on the not wanting to miss opportunities.
[00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:31.020]   But I'll push you on what happens if you've got this 45-minute flight, you're 5-10 minutes
[00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:34.700]   into this conversation and you're like, "There's not an opportunity."
[00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:35.700]   I've done that.
[00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:36.700]   Okay.
[00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:37.700]   So, yes.
[00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:38.700]   I've done that.
[00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:39.700]   And here's what I'll say.
[00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:42.420]   What I'll say happens.
[00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:47.980]   I'll entertain the conversation, and kindly, and I'll show genuine interest.
[00:45:47.980 --> 00:45:48.980]   It's true.
[00:45:48.980 --> 00:45:54.980]   And then if I feel like this is not one of those opportunities, this is a time to just
[00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:59.840]   be friendly, I'll say, I might even, I'm a very physical touch person.
[00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:03.780]   When I'm meeting somebody for the first time, I'll touch their arm gently to reassure them
[00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:04.780]   this is not personal.
[00:46:04.780 --> 00:46:06.500]   And I'll say, "You know what?
[00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:07.900]   I have not had any sleep."
[00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:13.020]   And I mean it because most times I have it, I'll say, "I've got to take a little bit of
[00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:14.020]   a nap.
[00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:15.020]   I apologize."
[00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:17.500]   And if they want to share their information with me, that's totally fine.
[00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:22.540]   But I literally like sleep is such at a premium and conversation is such at a premium.
[00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:24.300]   You don't have to feel bad.
[00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:25.820]   You can receive their information.
[00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:29.300]   It doesn't mean, you know, maybe you'll need it down the road, but it's okay to say, "You
[00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:30.300]   know what?
[00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:31.300]   Can I get your card?"
[00:46:31.300 --> 00:46:33.460]   And then say, "It was really nice to talk to you."
[00:46:33.460 --> 00:46:38.340]   And then I'm going to, or I've had times when I wasn't sleepy and I'm reading a book and
[00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:41.420]   they want to have a long conversation while I'm sitting there reading my book.
[00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:43.900]   And I'll say, "You know what?
[00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:45.580]   It was really nice talking with you."
[00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:49.180]   Like, cause I'll make small talk and I'll, it's more than small talk to me though.
[00:46:49.180 --> 00:46:50.180]   It's exploration.
[00:46:50.180 --> 00:46:52.860]   It's like, let me learn a little bit more about you.
[00:46:52.860 --> 00:46:53.860]   Okay.
[00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:54.860]   Well, this isn't in my head.
[00:46:54.860 --> 00:46:58.060]   This isn't an opportunity that's going to come to fruition in the way that I thought
[00:46:58.060 --> 00:47:00.580]   maybe it could, but I enjoy talking with you.
[00:47:00.580 --> 00:47:02.980]   I'm going to finish reading my book now, but it was really nice talking to you.
[00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:03.980]   I don't...
[00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:04.980]   There's nothing wrong with that.
[00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:06.820]   Like, don't fake the funk.
[00:47:06.820 --> 00:47:10.460]   Not every single person that you sit next to is going to be a goldmine.
[00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:14.860]   I'm sorry to keep probing, but this is like a place where I feel like kindness is either
[00:47:14.860 --> 00:47:20.820]   hard or in your mind, you either just, you don't love it, but you're able to do it.
[00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:24.620]   Is a room where there's maybe 50 people and you're done, you're at a conference.
[00:47:24.620 --> 00:47:29.040]   Maybe you're the one keynoting and you want to get around the room.
[00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:31.180]   You're stuck in a conversation.
[00:47:31.180 --> 00:47:35.340]   A lot of the typical excuses of "I need to go take a nap" or "I need to go eat" don't
[00:47:35.340 --> 00:47:39.820]   totally apply because the answer is really like, "We had a brief conversation and I want
[00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:42.260]   to go have a bunch of brief conversations."
[00:47:42.260 --> 00:47:46.320]   Oftentimes, I try to be honest and say, "Hey, I really enjoyed talking to you.
[00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:47.360]   There's a lot of people here.
[00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:49.140]   I want to make sure I get a chance to meet them.
[00:47:49.140 --> 00:47:50.660]   I'm going to go around."
[00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:55.180]   Sometimes I feel like people might take that as rude because we've only been talking five
[00:47:55.180 --> 00:47:58.960]   minutes and maybe they were still interested.
[00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:01.340]   Anything you would do in that circumstance differently?
[00:48:01.340 --> 00:48:02.340]   You know what?
[00:48:02.340 --> 00:48:03.820]   I can tell you're hungry for information on this.
[00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:08.840]   So I'm impressed that you're asking such in-depth conversational questions.
[00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:11.780]   I think for me, it's funny.
[00:48:11.780 --> 00:48:15.740]   There's an art to living and there's an art to conversations that are brief like that
[00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:16.740]   at those events.
[00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:21.220]   And you, again, this is something where you have to practice.
[00:48:21.220 --> 00:48:22.820]   Practice makes perfect.
[00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:24.300]   But I have no problem.
[00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:28.740]   See, I think that the biggest issue is that a lot of people in this generation are afraid
[00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:30.700]   to offend people.
[00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:37.580]   And I think that that fear leads to us being more obliged to be what we think is nice,
[00:48:37.580 --> 00:48:41.500]   kind, respectful, don't hurt anybody's feelings.
[00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:43.620]   It's like, it's too much fear.
[00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:46.920]   I think that getting rid of the fear is the key.
[00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:51.500]   It's not so much how do you do it, it's what do you eliminate in yourself so that you're
[00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:55.060]   more confident flowing from one conversation to the next?
[00:48:55.060 --> 00:48:57.140]   When I talk to people like, "Don't you...
[00:48:57.140 --> 00:49:00.620]   When you're with a group of your friends, don't you guys talk over each other all the
[00:49:00.620 --> 00:49:01.620]   time?"
[00:49:01.620 --> 00:49:02.620]   Yes.
[00:49:02.620 --> 00:49:03.620]   Does anybody get offended?
[00:49:03.620 --> 00:49:04.620]   No.
[00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:05.620]   You step on each other all the time.
[00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:06.620]   You're like, "No, no, no.
[00:49:06.620 --> 00:49:07.620]   Let me tell you.
[00:49:07.620 --> 00:49:08.620]   Oh, but..."
[00:49:08.620 --> 00:49:09.620]   And then somebody else...
[00:49:09.620 --> 00:49:12.380]   But nobody's feelings are getting hurt because you feel safe in that environment that you
[00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:13.860]   cut each other off all the time.
[00:49:13.860 --> 00:49:18.540]   But nobody's thinking, "I can't believe I didn't finish my thought."
[00:49:18.540 --> 00:49:23.800]   Nobody's thinking that because that's a normal organic conversation.
[00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:30.780]   So thinking of it, when you go into an event, I would want anybody to walk in and say, almost
[00:49:30.780 --> 00:49:32.460]   give themselves a pep talk.
[00:49:32.460 --> 00:49:38.420]   I'm going in to speak with this networking group or this gala or this cocktail, and I
[00:49:38.420 --> 00:49:39.420]   am among friends.
[00:49:39.420 --> 00:49:43.580]   And I'm going to have fun with this one, and I'm going to have fun with this one, and we're
[00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:44.580]   just going to keep it moving.
[00:49:44.580 --> 00:49:46.500]   And it's like, "Oh, I'm going to go get another drink."
[00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:50.100]   And, "Oh, I got to go say hi to this person."
[00:49:50.100 --> 00:49:54.300]   Oh, and it's like that jumping when you're with your boys, it's like jump in.
[00:49:54.300 --> 00:49:58.340]   And then they might be in the middle, "Oh, you know what?
[00:49:58.340 --> 00:49:59.340]   Forgive me.
[00:49:59.340 --> 00:50:02.460]   I need to go see somebody over here or see...
[00:50:02.460 --> 00:50:03.740]   Oh, I think I recognize him.
[00:50:03.740 --> 00:50:04.740]   Oh, you know what?
[00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:06.220]   I just remembered."
[00:50:06.220 --> 00:50:11.280]   It's just like organic, but you have to get rid of the fear.
[00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:15.680]   And I think one thing I took away from this was, if you're going in with the right intentions
[00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:21.780]   and you're kind in the first half of the conversation, then the kind of breakup of the conversation
[00:50:21.780 --> 00:50:23.500]   is pretty hard.
[00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:27.700]   Sure, someone might take offense to it because they really wanted to be there for longer.
[00:50:27.700 --> 00:50:34.060]   But if you accept that you can't control other people's feelings, but you did it with the
[00:50:34.060 --> 00:50:39.100]   right approach and the right intent, and you came in with genuine curiosity, I feel like
[00:50:39.100 --> 00:50:43.700]   you can live with the fact that someone could be offended and kind of get over that fear.
[00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:46.040]   I really don't think anybody's thinking that hard.
[00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:48.000]   I think that they're doing the same thing you are.
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:50.460]   They're wanting to talk to enough people.
[00:50:50.460 --> 00:50:54.860]   I think if you think of yourselves as having more in common than different with the people
[00:50:54.860 --> 00:50:57.620]   in the room, then it's a lot easier.
[00:50:57.620 --> 00:51:01.060]   Everybody else is trying to talk to as many people too.
[00:51:01.060 --> 00:51:04.460]   They're not thinking about, "Oh my God, they broke up with me in that conversation."
[00:51:04.460 --> 00:51:05.460]   No.
[00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:09.500]   Be kind to yourself and realize they're not thinking about you all that much.
[00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:13.660]   I can't remember who wrote this or said this recently, but people always assume that everyone's
[00:51:13.660 --> 00:51:15.580]   thinking about them.
[00:51:15.580 --> 00:51:17.500]   What they wore that day, how they misspoke.
[00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:20.940]   But the reality is that most people don't spend any of their time thinking about you
[00:51:20.940 --> 00:51:22.420]   or the other people.
[00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:26.700]   They're mostly thinking about themselves and just coming to terms with that makes it easier
[00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:31.780]   in so many situations in life to say, "Maybe someone didn't even hear me," or, "Think about
[00:51:31.780 --> 00:51:34.820]   it," or, "It didn't even last for longer than a moment in their mind."
[00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:35.820]   Yeah.
[00:51:35.820 --> 00:51:38.940]   And they have their own issues.
[00:51:38.940 --> 00:51:44.300]   We all have our own stuff that we're dealing with and I think that we have to remember
[00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:49.380]   that as much as we think or maybe even agonize over the things that we have to do or the
[00:51:49.380 --> 00:51:53.740]   dreams that we have to achieve, other people are taking the same amount of time working
[00:51:53.740 --> 00:51:54.740]   on their own stuff.
[00:51:54.740 --> 00:51:59.980]   And even if they had a moment with you where it's like, "Ugh, I thought that they were
[00:51:59.980 --> 00:52:05.640]   like this and they're like that," or, "Oh, I thought I knew them," it's like they get
[00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:08.020]   over it with the next thing that comes along.
[00:52:08.020 --> 00:52:10.060]   So yeah, don't sweat it.
[00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:11.380]   Just have fun.
[00:52:11.380 --> 00:52:14.440]   I want to get to a few tactical things before we wrap.
[00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:18.580]   You had a bunch of ideas in the book about scheduling kindness into your day, building
[00:52:18.580 --> 00:52:19.580]   it into a habit.
[00:52:19.580 --> 00:52:23.540]   I'm curious if you could just walk through a few examples of how people could practice
[00:52:23.540 --> 00:52:30.220]   this and just hone those skills, maybe today or tomorrow or over the next week.
[00:52:30.220 --> 00:52:35.460]   Until kindness, just as a muscle, becomes developed where it's this natural organic
[00:52:35.460 --> 00:52:41.620]   process of always thinking about like, "How can I express to other people that I'm with
[00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:43.380]   them, that I'm for them?"
[00:52:43.380 --> 00:52:46.400]   Think about who you can call on a regular basis.
[00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:53.220]   My mentor, Bill Krauss, he would give his business advice to those who he coached.
[00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:57.780]   Spend an hour on past, an hour on present, and an hour on future.
[00:52:57.780 --> 00:53:02.060]   So that means call your past clients, check in on them every single day, even if you're
[00:53:02.060 --> 00:53:04.780]   in sales and you don't have any leads right now.
[00:53:04.780 --> 00:53:09.300]   You reaching out to people who are your past clients is going to reconnect you and for
[00:53:09.300 --> 00:53:13.100]   nothing else other than to just say, "Hey, thank you for your business in the past.
[00:53:13.100 --> 00:53:18.060]   Thank you for the relationship that we've been able to build over the years."
[00:53:18.060 --> 00:53:21.620]   Present would be those that you're working on currently and then future, those who you're
[00:53:21.620 --> 00:53:24.100]   endeavoring to land.
[00:53:24.100 --> 00:53:28.580]   Just reaching out and giving those friendly phone calls, even if it's five, 10 minutes.
[00:53:28.580 --> 00:53:32.500]   I recently went to an event and I met all these people and I gathered these business
[00:53:32.500 --> 00:53:34.940]   cards that are actually sitting right here to my right of me.
[00:53:34.940 --> 00:53:40.820]   And I took some time a couple of weeks ago and I just reached out on text message to
[00:53:40.820 --> 00:53:41.900]   all those people.
[00:53:41.900 --> 00:53:44.780]   And then this was the week that I was going to reach out by phone to some of them.
[00:53:44.780 --> 00:53:50.740]   But it was just a matter of scheduling out time in my day and for nothing else other
[00:53:50.740 --> 00:53:57.180]   than to either check in, say hello, or ask for the answer to some questions.
[00:53:57.180 --> 00:54:01.420]   And schedule it for like five, 15 minutes for each person.
[00:54:01.420 --> 00:54:07.020]   But I think that's a really good way to not forget the people who have been kind to you
[00:54:07.020 --> 00:54:10.660]   and believed in you and have supported you and invested.
[00:54:10.660 --> 00:54:16.360]   And then with your friendships, friendships are such a big part of our lives.
[00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:21.260]   And a lot of times as we get busy, or even those who get married and start having kids,
[00:54:21.260 --> 00:54:26.420]   the friendships fade into the background, but those are the spine of how you can stand
[00:54:26.420 --> 00:54:28.940]   steady in crazy times and in hard times.
[00:54:28.940 --> 00:54:34.100]   So checking in, whether that's once a month or once a week, and just saying, "Hey, I didn't
[00:54:34.100 --> 00:54:35.100]   need anything.
[00:54:35.100 --> 00:54:38.140]   I'm just calling to say I appreciate you.
[00:54:38.140 --> 00:54:41.140]   I'm looking forward to the next time we can hang out."
[00:54:41.140 --> 00:54:47.420]   These are relational things, but they're really kind acts that people get too busy for in
[00:54:47.420 --> 00:54:52.580]   the midst of hustling, in the midst of trying to make it to the next step on the economic
[00:54:52.580 --> 00:54:54.640]   food chain.
[00:54:54.640 --> 00:55:00.560]   And so once you do that, I think it's sometimes easier to do kindness to strangers, whether
[00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:05.380]   it's opening a door, paying for somebody's coffee or lunch in line ahead of you.
[00:55:05.380 --> 00:55:10.620]   And just like scheduling, like once a month, I'm going to do a surprise kindness to a stranger.
[00:55:10.620 --> 00:55:14.860]   That makes you feel connected to the larger neighborhood or community that you're in.
[00:55:14.860 --> 00:55:19.660]   And you actually feel like a world changer every single time, rather than just somebody
[00:55:19.660 --> 00:55:23.180]   who's going through the motions, not smiling and not speaking to anybody, just going and
[00:55:23.180 --> 00:55:29.460]   getting your Uber Eats delivery downstairs or your Instacart order.
[00:55:29.460 --> 00:55:33.260]   Let's all remind each other that we are connected and that we need each other.
[00:55:33.260 --> 00:55:36.860]   It's as simple as a phone call or a text or sending a video to somebody and saying, "Hey,
[00:55:36.860 --> 00:55:37.860]   I was thinking about you.
[00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:38.860]   You're amazing.
[00:55:38.860 --> 00:55:39.860]   You're a rock star.
[00:55:39.860 --> 00:55:41.420]   Talk to you soon."
[00:55:41.420 --> 00:55:46.500]   There was an app a long time ago that I wish still existed that would sync across all of
[00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:49.580]   your texts and your emails and be like, "Hey, here's a person you haven't reached out to
[00:55:49.580 --> 00:55:50.580]   in a year."
[00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:56.300]   So if anyone's listening and knows of something new that does that, let me know, because it
[00:55:56.300 --> 00:55:57.300]   would be great.
[00:55:57.300 --> 00:56:00.980]   I don't want to know who I haven't emailed in six months because maybe I texted them.
[00:56:00.980 --> 00:56:01.980]   Maybe I called them.
[00:56:01.980 --> 00:56:03.540]   Maybe I saw them on my calendar.
[00:56:03.540 --> 00:56:07.660]   But if you could somehow bring all that together, it would be incredible.
[00:56:07.660 --> 00:56:11.860]   I assume there's a big privacy element there and hopefully, it's a company that you could
[00:56:11.860 --> 00:56:12.860]   trust.
[00:56:12.860 --> 00:56:18.300]   But I'll come back to one thing you said, which was, you have a mentor and you talk
[00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:21.740]   about mentors in the book being kind of invaluable tour guides.
[00:56:21.740 --> 00:56:25.180]   How has that worked in your career and in your life?
[00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:28.920]   And what advice would you give to someone who maybe doesn't have a mentor right now?
[00:56:28.920 --> 00:56:34.060]   Well, number one, I'd be really clear on what you expect out of a mentor relationship.
[00:56:34.060 --> 00:56:36.100]   I think that a lot of people think they know what mentoring is.
[00:56:36.100 --> 00:56:38.300]   And it's like, "Oh, I want somebody that has my back.
[00:56:38.300 --> 00:56:40.140]   I want somebody who will check in on me.
[00:56:40.140 --> 00:56:42.140]   I want somebody who will give me advice."
[00:56:42.140 --> 00:56:46.740]   But mentoring relationships are extremely intimate if you let them be.
[00:56:46.740 --> 00:56:51.700]   And they have a lot, like a mentor has a lot to give you, but they also have a lot at stake.
[00:56:51.700 --> 00:56:56.420]   I mean, their time could be better served by something that's not as emotionally invested
[00:56:56.420 --> 00:56:57.420]   as mentoring.
[00:56:57.420 --> 00:56:59.980]   They could be doing a business deal.
[00:56:59.980 --> 00:57:05.340]   And even if they're relational as people, and they love quality time, the fact is, is
[00:57:05.340 --> 00:57:09.140]   that when you mentor somebody, you're giving them some of that feedback or some of that
[00:57:09.140 --> 00:57:13.380]   constructive content that could be taken wrong.
[00:57:13.380 --> 00:57:16.620]   And people's feelings get hurt in mentoring relationships.
[00:57:16.620 --> 00:57:20.460]   And people feel betrayed, or people feel like they don't get me.
[00:57:20.460 --> 00:57:24.300]   When you're establishing a relationship with somebody who you almost are giving the power
[00:57:24.300 --> 00:57:29.700]   to say no, you're giving them the power to look into your life and be more vulnerable
[00:57:29.700 --> 00:57:33.020]   with them, which can be very scary to some people.
[00:57:33.020 --> 00:57:38.200]   And so I would just take stock of where you are in your life, how honest you want to live,
[00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:40.540]   and how teachable you are right now.
[00:57:40.540 --> 00:57:44.100]   Are you willing to be told that what you're doing is absolutely wrong?
[00:57:44.100 --> 00:57:47.640]   Are you willing to be told that you need to make course corrections in order to become
[00:57:47.640 --> 00:57:49.540]   the person that you say you want to become?
[00:57:49.540 --> 00:57:53.420]   If you are really honest with yourself and you can see that you want that, then you're
[00:57:53.420 --> 00:57:56.300]   eligible for a mentor.
[00:57:56.300 --> 00:58:00.260]   And then in terms of like connecting with the right mentor, it really is a matter of
[00:58:00.260 --> 00:58:04.580]   starting off almost like you would in a relationship, you know, obviously no romantic interest,
[00:58:04.580 --> 00:58:09.200]   but you know, you don't just jump to third base with somebody that you're interested
[00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:10.200]   in.
[00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:14.000]   You know, you start off with maybe a DM or you ask them for their phone number at the
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:19.360]   grocery store, or you ask them to coffee, you know, typically you don't just jump straight
[00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:20.600]   to dinner with people.
[00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:24.800]   I mean, sometimes you do, I guess, but it's just, it's a nurturing process.
[00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:27.640]   So rather than ask somebody, will you mentor me?
[00:58:27.640 --> 00:58:31.520]   I think the best thing to do is can I get five to 15 minutes with you?
[00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:36.960]   And once you give yourself and them that space to kind of get to know you and you get to
[00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:41.600]   know them, then, you know, check in again, Hey, I'd love another five, 15 minute check
[00:58:41.600 --> 00:58:42.600]   in.
[00:58:42.600 --> 00:58:43.600]   Like we haven't talked in four weeks.
[00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:45.600]   Like, how are you?
[00:58:45.600 --> 00:58:48.560]   And show genuine interest in that mentor.
[00:58:48.560 --> 00:58:53.440]   Don't just look for them to be genuinely interested in you and know, and, you know, answer all
[00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:54.440]   your questions.
[00:58:54.440 --> 00:58:57.480]   How can you be interested in them and what they bring to the table?
[00:58:57.480 --> 00:59:05.080]   I think that it's, it's gotta be mutually, I guess the word is again, that word reciprocity
[00:59:05.080 --> 00:59:06.800]   always comes to my mind.
[00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:12.560]   Like, how are you seeing their value while you're hoping that they see yours?
[00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:13.900]   Are you valuing their time?
[00:59:13.900 --> 00:59:16.840]   Are you valuing, valuing that experience that they bring to the table?
[00:59:16.840 --> 00:59:19.760]   Are you valuing the fact that they might be going through something in life?
[00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:23.640]   And are you willing to check in with them and say, not like, how are you as if you're
[00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:28.960]   their counselor, but like, Hey, you know what, I'm willing to do what I need to do to spend
[00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:29.960]   time with you.
[00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:34.280]   If, and you notice them, study them, don't say, is there anything I can do for you?
[00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:36.520]   Cause they're going to say no.
[00:59:36.520 --> 00:59:41.360]   Study them and find out, notice if it's at the office that they don't have an assistant
[00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:42.360]   on Fridays.
[00:59:42.360 --> 00:59:45.680]   You know, they only have an assistant four days a week, you know, Hey, I noticed that
[00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:49.360]   on Fridays, you know, you don't have, your staff isn't filled up or don't even mention
[00:59:49.360 --> 00:59:50.360]   that.
[00:59:50.360 --> 00:59:53.120]   Just say, I'd like to, you know, give you an hour of my time on Fridays.
[00:59:53.120 --> 00:59:58.440]   Is there anything I can do, um, in regards to, and then be super specific bookkeeping
[00:59:58.440 --> 01:00:02.440]   or, you know, can I help run some, uh, get some coffee?
[01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:06.600]   You might be such at a level of your experience that you would never be getting coffee.
[01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:08.420]   Like that's for an intern to do.
[01:00:08.420 --> 01:00:12.040]   But I remember there was one executive at one of my previous jobs and I knew how she
[01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:16.120]   took her coffee and I would just show up and bring it to her.
[01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:17.400]   There was never an expectation.
[01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:19.560]   And every time I did, I got a thank you email.
[01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:21.560]   I just left it on her.
[01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:22.560]   It bonded us.
[01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:27.240]   It created a relationship with us where I could go in and speak to her pretty much anytime
[01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:28.540]   I wanted to.
[01:00:28.540 --> 01:00:34.260]   But many people are looking at mentoring relationships and making demands of what they think a mentor
[01:00:34.260 --> 01:00:35.260]   should do for them.
[01:00:35.260 --> 01:00:37.260]   They're not knowingly doing this.
[01:00:37.260 --> 01:00:40.260]   It's not like people are coming there with an attitude or an air about them.
[01:00:40.260 --> 01:00:46.140]   It's just like, you have to understand what, there's a service element to somebody mentoring
[01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:52.780]   you and volunteering that time and for you being a serving, a kind person back to them.
[01:00:52.780 --> 01:00:56.380]   So just, if you're willing to do anything, I think you can have the right mentor and
[01:00:56.380 --> 01:00:58.020]   have a wonderful relationship.
[01:00:58.020 --> 01:01:02.340]   I think an important takeaway that I learned as an investor and as an entrepreneur with
[01:01:02.340 --> 01:01:07.100]   investors, while your investors aren't necessarily mentors, in some ways they are, but a big
[01:01:07.100 --> 01:01:10.640]   thing is to not make your offer to help more work.
[01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:14.340]   So oftentimes, people would say, "Hey, is there anybody you can introduce me to that
[01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:15.340]   would help?"
[01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:18.740]   And my answer would be like, "I don't know."
[01:01:18.740 --> 01:01:23.380]   But some people, and I took this from them and then applied it myself, would say, "Hey,
[01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:27.860]   I looked on your LinkedIn, you know these six people who I think could be valuable to
[01:01:27.860 --> 01:01:29.380]   what I'm doing.
[01:01:29.380 --> 01:01:31.860]   Would you be willing to make an introduction?
[01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:35.260]   Here is a copy and paste thing you could use if it's helpful."
[01:01:35.260 --> 01:01:40.940]   The more you can do the work to ask for help, the more people are willing to help.
[01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:45.260]   And then what you said that I really liked, which is a perfect segue to my next question,
[01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:48.900]   is show that you're willing to take their advice.
[01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:53.540]   Because I think people get a lot of personal satisfaction knowing that their advice is
[01:01:53.540 --> 01:01:58.740]   actually being put to use versus knowing that it's just being heard and sitting there.
[01:01:58.740 --> 01:02:04.020]   So I said I'd come back to asking you with all of your experience interviewing.
[01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:07.220]   I know it'll benefit the show if I can improve my skills.
[01:02:07.220 --> 01:02:11.220]   I know it'll make me more fulfilled if I do better.
[01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:16.300]   You can choose to give advice to a podcaster who's one year into interviewing or you can
[01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:20.060]   go direct and give it straight to me, whatever makes you more comfortable.
[01:02:20.060 --> 01:02:24.020]   I can take anything feedback-wise.
[01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:25.020]   What do you have for me?
[01:02:25.020 --> 01:02:31.180]   Well, I think that based on how you ask questions, I think you want to do such a good job.
[01:02:31.180 --> 01:02:37.700]   And when we're hungry to do a good job, sometimes we can not listen as attentively because we're
[01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:40.300]   so wanting to do the best.
[01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:44.260]   And I think if you take the pressure off of yourself a little bit.
[01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:48.980]   I think you're humble, but I think at the same time, you're sometimes not comparing
[01:02:48.980 --> 01:02:52.740]   yourself in a competitive way, but you're saying, "Oh, well, this person has done A,
[01:02:52.740 --> 01:02:54.580]   B, and C, and D, and I've done this."
[01:02:54.580 --> 01:02:57.380]   And it's like, but you have something else to bring to the table.
[01:02:57.380 --> 01:02:58.740]   You know what I mean?
[01:02:58.740 --> 01:03:05.300]   But like when people are doing something new, they try so hard to be so good that some of
[01:03:05.300 --> 01:03:13.420]   their sensory gifts, whether it's listening or whether it's eye contact or whether it's
[01:03:13.420 --> 01:03:16.780]   feeling can get tuned out.
[01:03:16.780 --> 01:03:21.300]   So just flow a little bit more.
[01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:22.300]   This is not a critique.
[01:03:22.300 --> 01:03:27.460]   It's more just taking you to the next level because you have a great voice and you do
[01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:30.660]   ask good questions like what you just gave.
[01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:32.540]   This is what advice you got from investors.
[01:03:32.540 --> 01:03:33.740]   I love that.
[01:03:33.740 --> 01:03:38.940]   That made me want to ask you another question about what you've learned from investors.
[01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:45.060]   So you've had, obviously, a lot of great experiences, no matter what your experience is in podcasting.
[01:03:45.060 --> 01:03:49.820]   You've had amazing experiences in entrepreneurial or the business community.
[01:03:49.820 --> 01:03:59.620]   I might start with that at the top of your podcast, rather than a story that could...
[01:03:59.620 --> 01:04:02.940]   The Lord of the Flies, I think is what you referenced in the beginning.
[01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:03.940]   Not bad.
[01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:06.180]   But you have...
[01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:09.260]   What would you think is your expertise?
[01:04:09.260 --> 01:04:14.940]   What's your strength in terms of what you bring?
[01:04:14.940 --> 01:04:18.620]   I feel like I've had the entrepreneur and the investor path.
[01:04:18.620 --> 01:04:23.340]   And then I'm also this crazy researcher where when I want to learn about a thing, whether
[01:04:23.340 --> 01:04:30.980]   it's a stroller that we're buying for a baby or a vacation, I will go so deep on the research
[01:04:30.980 --> 01:04:33.180]   to try to understand every nuance to it.
[01:04:33.180 --> 01:04:39.260]   I think those 2 elements of my life are the optimizer and then the entrepreneur investor.
[01:04:39.260 --> 01:04:43.240]   I think that you should start with those strengths at the top of your interviews.
[01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:46.100]   I thought it was cool that you used a story to introduce me.
[01:04:46.100 --> 01:04:47.880]   I thought that was neat.
[01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:51.340]   But just what you said at the very end piqued my interest.
[01:04:51.340 --> 01:04:57.420]   And I think piquing the interest of the interviewee makes for a more mutual conversation rather
[01:04:57.420 --> 01:05:02.820]   than you asking questions like, "They're the expert and I'm just here to ask them questions
[01:05:02.820 --> 01:05:04.500]   to get this great thing."
[01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:10.340]   It'll become much more of an interesting interview when you allow that part of you to shine more
[01:05:10.340 --> 01:05:11.340]   and not to minimize it.
[01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:12.340]   I don't know.
[01:05:12.340 --> 01:05:14.380]   I would think most people, when you ask them, "Do you have any questions?"
[01:05:14.380 --> 01:05:15.380]   They usually don't.
[01:05:15.380 --> 01:05:16.380]   Right?
[01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:17.380]   They never have one.
[01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:18.380]   Maybe.
[01:05:18.380 --> 01:05:19.380]   Yeah.
[01:05:19.380 --> 01:05:20.380]   Not really.
[01:05:20.380 --> 01:05:21.620]   Like, "Where do I look?"
[01:05:21.620 --> 01:05:22.620]   And so since they...
[01:05:22.620 --> 01:05:23.620]   It's kind of like what you said.
[01:05:23.620 --> 01:05:24.620]   What did you...
[01:05:24.620 --> 01:05:25.620]   Did you just say it?
[01:05:25.620 --> 01:05:26.620]   Or did I say it?
[01:05:26.620 --> 01:05:29.660]   You said, "Don't make them helping you more work."
[01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:34.540]   And I was saying how, "Don't ask them, 'Is there anything I can do for you?'"
[01:05:34.540 --> 01:05:37.620]   That question of, "Do you have any questions?" is kind of like, "Is there anything I can
[01:05:37.620 --> 01:05:38.740]   do for you?"
[01:05:38.740 --> 01:05:40.180]   Because they're not thinking about any questions.
[01:05:40.180 --> 01:05:41.180]   They're like, "I'm sitting here.
[01:05:41.180 --> 01:05:42.760]   You told me where to go."
[01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:44.900]   And so it's like, if you can start...
[01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:46.420]   I just think that...
[01:05:46.420 --> 01:05:50.140]   And I don't know how old you are or where you are in your journey, but I would say you
[01:05:50.140 --> 01:05:53.820]   have a lot more experience than I do in some areas of business.
[01:05:53.820 --> 01:05:55.140]   A lot more.
[01:05:55.140 --> 01:05:56.940]   And I could learn from you.
[01:05:56.940 --> 01:06:01.780]   And so rather than coming off like, "I'm such a great business mind," I would want you to
[01:06:01.780 --> 01:06:05.920]   at least show up with enough of, "This is what I bring to the table.
[01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:10.060]   But I know that I'm interviewing fill in the blank because they bring something else to
[01:06:10.060 --> 01:06:13.420]   the table that I know you who are listening needs."
[01:06:13.420 --> 01:06:15.180]   Does that make sense?
[01:06:15.180 --> 01:06:17.140]   Yeah, it totally does.
[01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:20.260]   And it's funny because I usually record the intros after.
[01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:23.020]   And so as I was giving it, I was like, "Yeah, if this doesn't work, I'll redo it."
[01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:27.820]   So if I end up redoing it, half of what you just said will be very confusing to people.
[01:06:27.820 --> 01:06:33.820]   But maybe I'll post the original intro somewhere else for anyone listening if I end up making
[01:06:33.820 --> 01:06:34.820]   that decision.
[01:06:34.820 --> 01:06:38.220]   So this has been really fantastic.
[01:06:38.220 --> 01:06:39.620]   There's one wrap-up question.
[01:06:39.620 --> 01:06:43.780]   So first off, I'm going to take a lot of that to heart, just to be clear.
[01:06:43.780 --> 01:06:48.780]   If you want to keep listening in the coming weeks, hopefully you'll see better introductions
[01:06:48.780 --> 01:06:55.020]   and more infusion of things that I know to a conversation that can make it more reciprocal,
[01:06:55.020 --> 01:06:56.020]   as you mentioned in the book.
[01:06:56.020 --> 01:06:57.020]   Yeah.
[01:06:57.020 --> 01:06:59.180]   No, you have a lot to offer.
[01:06:59.180 --> 01:07:00.460]   Thank you for giving feedback.
[01:07:00.460 --> 01:07:01.540]   I ask for it a lot.
[01:07:01.540 --> 01:07:02.540]   I don't always get it.
[01:07:02.540 --> 01:07:04.460]   So it's very, very welcomed.
[01:07:04.460 --> 01:07:10.760]   The one question I like to ask everyone at the end of every episode is, pick a place
[01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:15.980]   where you're most comfortable, city that you know well, and give a little bit of advice
[01:07:15.980 --> 01:07:20.580]   to people who might be heading there for whether it's a place to go have dinner, place to meet
[01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:26.020]   a friend for a drink, something unusual to do, or ideally, maybe all three.
[01:07:26.020 --> 01:07:31.560]   So I live in Chicago now, and I absolutely fell in love with Chicago, had no intention
[01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:32.900]   of moving here.
[01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:38.300]   Always thought I would live on the coasts, LA or New York, especially in my business.
[01:07:38.300 --> 01:07:42.860]   And when this opportunity came about, I came here first as a visiting correspondent when
[01:07:42.860 --> 01:07:44.300]   I worked for my previous job.
[01:07:44.300 --> 01:07:48.700]   What I just noticed, the architecture was so beautiful, and the downtown area, there's
[01:07:48.700 --> 01:07:56.540]   a beach with a magnificent skyline and a river all in the same area.
[01:07:56.540 --> 01:07:58.100]   You can do everything.
[01:07:58.100 --> 01:08:02.340]   So when it's sunny outside, like it is now, you'll see boats all in the river and on the
[01:08:02.340 --> 01:08:05.980]   lake, and it's just gorgeous, the light hitting off all these buildings.
[01:08:05.980 --> 01:08:10.180]   So the one thing that I would say is if you come to Chicago, you have to do the Chicago
[01:08:10.180 --> 01:08:12.540]   architectural tour.
[01:08:12.540 --> 01:08:17.300]   The city is seen in a way unlike any other way you can actually witness it.
[01:08:17.300 --> 01:08:22.220]   They tell you about the history of the city of Chicago, who founded the city, why the
[01:08:22.220 --> 01:08:25.280]   buildings are built the way they are, who built them.
[01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:29.900]   Some of the most world-renowned architects have their work on display here in the city
[01:08:29.900 --> 01:08:31.020]   of Chicago.
[01:08:31.020 --> 01:08:33.180]   For dinner, there's way too many options.
[01:08:33.180 --> 01:08:35.440]   I just had high tea at the Peninsula.
[01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:42.500]   So for anybody who loves that London experience, it was phenomenal with a live string duet.
[01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:49.300]   I mean, again, like there's just a little something for everybody and you will get some
[01:08:49.300 --> 01:08:55.340]   of the best pizza in the world, whether it's deep dish or it's thin crust, but just walking
[01:08:55.340 --> 01:08:58.460]   through the city and seeing all the different neighborhoods, because every single neighborhood
[01:08:58.460 --> 01:09:04.980]   in Chicago has its own personality and you have it all within a few miles.
[01:09:04.980 --> 01:09:09.840]   I definitely appeal to people to come to Chicago if they've never been and check it out.
[01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:14.540]   It is one of the most magnificent cities, I think, not just in the US, but in the world.
[01:09:14.540 --> 01:09:16.420]   I have been to Chicago a few times.
[01:09:16.420 --> 01:09:17.420]   I agree.
[01:09:17.420 --> 01:09:19.740]   In the summer, I didn't really realize there was a beach.
[01:09:19.740 --> 01:09:24.180]   So I would say if you're going to Chicago in the summer, like prepare for a beach day.
[01:09:24.180 --> 01:09:28.620]   Like this is the kind of beach day I didn't expect where people are like, you know, throwing
[01:09:28.620 --> 01:09:30.820]   frisbees, drinking beer, sitting on the sand.
[01:09:30.820 --> 01:09:36.500]   It kind of blew my mind because as a non-local, it just wasn't something I expected.
[01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:41.060]   But I have a question for you if you're done with my questions.
[01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:46.240]   Tell me one other thing that you've learned from investors that you think every person
[01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:54.660]   should know that sometimes they overlook or they're really in too much of a rush to pay
[01:09:54.660 --> 01:09:56.220]   attention to.
[01:09:56.220 --> 01:10:03.260]   I think something that I learned as an investor and an entrepreneur at the same time was that
[01:10:03.260 --> 01:10:09.500]   as much as people schedule a lot of time to have a conversation, they're making a decision
[01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:13.660]   in the first moments that is often unchanged.
[01:10:13.660 --> 01:10:19.500]   So if you're trying to tell a story about your company, don't have the story come 10
[01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:24.700]   minutes in because you need, you know, it's like a rule of social media and videos on
[01:10:24.700 --> 01:10:25.700]   YouTube.
[01:10:25.700 --> 01:10:27.100]   It's like you got to captivate someone in the first 10 seconds.
[01:10:27.100 --> 01:10:30.660]   Well, when you're meeting an investor, when you're trying to explain your company, it's
[01:10:30.660 --> 01:10:33.940]   like the first minute or two that matters.
[01:10:33.940 --> 01:10:40.660]   And so if you aren't good at doing that with writing, then I wouldn't try to send the description
[01:10:40.660 --> 01:10:45.580]   of your company with enough detail that someone could make that decision in an email.
[01:10:45.580 --> 01:10:49.580]   If you feel like whatever the medium that's best for you, if your data shows well, have
[01:10:49.580 --> 01:10:51.820]   that be the first few slides and email it.
[01:10:51.820 --> 01:10:55.900]   If it's the story about how connected you are to the mission of the company and the
[01:10:55.900 --> 01:10:59.340]   reason it was created, make sure that comes across first.
[01:10:59.340 --> 01:11:04.620]   And don't feel like you have to follow any guidelines around what the arc of an investor's
[01:11:04.620 --> 01:11:06.100]   conversation is.
[01:11:06.100 --> 01:11:10.620]   And this probably applies in many other sales tactics or professional environments.
[01:11:10.620 --> 01:11:14.860]   But so many times people said what they think you wanted to hear.
[01:11:14.860 --> 01:11:15.860]   But if you said...
[01:11:15.860 --> 01:11:21.060]   By the end, I would often give feedback and say, "Hey, you should lead with this story."
[01:11:21.060 --> 01:11:22.060]   I would give it away.
[01:11:22.060 --> 01:11:23.060]   It's like, "We're not investing.
[01:11:23.060 --> 01:11:24.060]   I'm really sorry.
[01:11:24.060 --> 01:11:25.820]   This is not a good fit for us right now."
[01:11:25.820 --> 01:11:30.580]   But if you're giving this pitch, again, this is the piece of the story that I would start
[01:11:30.580 --> 01:11:31.700]   with.
[01:11:31.700 --> 01:11:36.460]   And if anyone listening wants a little deeper dive, Sunil Gupta, who wrote a book called
[01:11:36.460 --> 01:11:39.140]   Backable, we had a conversation.
[01:11:39.140 --> 01:11:42.760]   I don't remember the episode number, but I'll link it in the show notes, where he talked
[01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:49.140]   about how he completely changed the narrative of his fundraising stories as an entrepreneur
[01:11:49.140 --> 01:11:55.240]   because the story of why he was there was actually the thing that got people excited.
[01:11:55.240 --> 01:11:59.300]   Even though he thought that company had good metrics or a good, well-designed product,
[01:11:59.300 --> 01:12:03.180]   that story was, it turns out, the most powerful thing and he had to rechange everything to
[01:12:03.180 --> 01:12:07.540]   focus on it and focus on it really early.
[01:12:07.540 --> 01:12:08.620]   That's very good advice.
[01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:10.020]   And that's like the elevator close.
[01:12:10.020 --> 01:12:15.140]   But again, stories sell and being able to tell that in the first 60 seconds, it's true.
[01:12:15.140 --> 01:12:19.980]   Because people are making an impression or they have an impression of you right away.
[01:12:19.980 --> 01:12:23.780]   And like one of the gentlemen in my life who works with me says, "Adrienne, the first answer
[01:12:23.780 --> 01:12:28.200]   is always the right answer and everything else is BS."
[01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:29.760]   Thank you so much for being here.
