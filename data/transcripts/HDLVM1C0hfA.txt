[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.080]   Very often the best questions we get are very simple ones, like this one today from Maxine,
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.320]   a longtime listener to APJ.
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.120]   "Pastor John, hello and thank you for this podcast.
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:21.280]   Can you explain to me who wrote the Bible?"
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:30.600]   Well, let's start at the top and work our way down to who held the very quill that moved
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.480]   across the parchments.
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.240]   At the top is God.
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:42.880]   When Christians refer to the Bible as the Word of God, they mean that—and I would
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:49.040]   say I mean, I'm one of those people who believe this, I stake my whole life on it—I
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:55.960]   mean that the Creator of the universe, the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:05.520]   upholds the universe by the Word of His power, was guiding and is guiding all things according
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.200]   to a great purpose.
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:14.960]   That God has chosen to reveal Himself to human beings in human language.
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.560]   He has chosen to speak.
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.760]   Amazing.
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:30.000]   Hebrews 1, verses 1 and 2 say, "Long ago, at many times and in many ways, God spoke
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:40.760]   to our fathers by the prophets, but in these last days, He has spoken to us by His Son,
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.000]   Jesus Christ."
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.360]   That's simply staggering.
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.600]   God has spoken.
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:55.240]   The phrase "Thus says the Lord" occurs over 400 times in the Old Testament as the
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.920]   writers put forward in their writings that God has spoken.
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:08.320]   The phrase "God said" occurs over 600 times in the Old Testament.
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:16.160]   So there's this pervasive claim of the human writers that they are delivering what
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.320]   God once said.
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:25.940]   The way the New Testament writers express this claim is to say that the human writers
[00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.600]   of the Bible were "inspired."
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:38.280]   These writings are God-breathed, or the people who wrote them were carried along by the Spirit
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.280]   Spirit.
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:45.760]   For example, the Apostle Paul says in 2 Timothy 3.16, "All Scripture"—that is, for him
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:52.560]   at that time, that was all the Old Testament books of the Bible—"is breathed out by
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.520]   God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction."
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:06.920]   And Peter, the Apostle Peter, says in 2 Peter 1, verse 20, "No prophecy was ever produced
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:18.720]   by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit."
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.960]   So the question, "Who wrote the Bible?" always has a double answer in the Bible.
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:30.780]   Human authors wrote the Bible, and God wrote the Bible through the human authors.
[00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:39.380]   They actually held the quill that moved across the parchment, but what they wrote was ultimately
[00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.280]   what God wanted written.
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:51.560]   Jesus—I love this way he did this—but he gave us an amazing indication that he believed
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:59.020]   the Old Testament scriptures were in fact God's Word, God's writing.
[00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:04.340]   What makes this indication that Jesus gave so powerful is because it's so inadvertent.
[00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.540]   He's talking about divorce, and he answers the Pharisees' question by saying in Matthew
[00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:16.140]   19.3-5, "Have you not read"—you know, he's talking about writings—"Have you
[00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:23.880]   not read that he who created them"—that is, male and female—"he who created them
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:32.360]   from the beginning made them male and female, and said"—no, the subject of that verb
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:40.660]   is "he who created them," that's God—"and he said"—and then he quotes Genesis 2.24,
[00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.140]   "Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother, and hold fast to his wife, and
[00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.780]   the two shall become one flesh."
[00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.860]   But that verse was not a quotation of God in the Old Testament.
[00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.660]   It was written by Moses, the human author.
[00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:59.540]   But when Jesus quotes it, because it's from the scriptures, the inspired scriptures,
[00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.940]   Jesus says God said those words.
[00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:03.940]   That's amazing.
[00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:11.380]   That's a really powerful indication of how our Lord himself viewed the Old Testament
[00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:18.340]   scriptures, which is why he said in Matthew 5.17, "Do not think that I have come to
[00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.140]   abolish the law or the prophets."
[00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:22.620]   In other words, the whole Old Testament.
[00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.100]   "Don't think that I've come to abolish them.
[00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.900]   I haven't come to abolish them.
[00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.020]   They're God's Word.
[00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.720]   I have come to fulfill them.
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:38.420]   For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, not the
[00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:45.980]   smallest part of the scriptures will pass from the law until all is accomplished."
[00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:51.860]   And he said in John 10.35, "The scriptures cannot be broken."
[00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:58.880]   This is also how the New Testament apostles saw their own writings, not just the Old Testament,
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.580]   but the New Testament writings.
[00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:08.220]   Jesus had promised them that he would guide them into all truth, John 16.13.
[00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:15.460]   And Paul said, "Therefore, we impart this," that is, what he's revealing in his letters,
[00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:25.060]   "We impart this in words taught not by human wisdom, but taught by the Spirit," 1 Corinthians
[00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:26.660]   2.13.
[00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:31.700]   So there are always two answers to the question, "Who wrote the Bible?"
[00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:33.180]   God and man.
[00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:42.260]   Ultimately, God saw to it that what he wanted written was written.
[00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:46.940]   And in that sense, you could say God wrote the Bible.
[00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:54.100]   But we would not mean that he carved it in stone, although he did carve the Ten Commandments
[00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:58.140]   in stone on Mount Sinai and gave them to Moses.
[00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:05.860]   And we would not mean that God held the hand of the human writers and wrote in his heavenly
[00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:09.100]   style, not their human style.
[00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:10.100]   That's not the case.
[00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:14.080]   The human authors have their own style, and God guides it.
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:18.560]   He doesn't impose on it his singular style.
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:26.440]   We would simply mean that God superintended the human writing so that the authors wrote
[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.400]   what he wanted written.
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:34.600]   So who were the human writers of the Bible?
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:39.600]   That's the most direct meaning or the most direct way this question was posed.
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.200]   Let me try to answer it as directly.
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:47.200]   At least ten of the books of the Bible are unsigned.
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:53.120]   The authors did not see fit to include their names in the books they wrote.
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:57.200]   For example, Job and Esther in the Old Testament.
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.280]   We don't know who wrote them.
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.620]   In the New Testament, Hebrews.
[00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:03.800]   We don't know who wrote Hebrews.
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:08.600]   But the traditional list of authors would go like this.
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:14.400]   Moses wrote the first five books of the Bible and at least one of the Psalms.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:20.760]   Ezra, the scribe, wrote the books of Ezra in 1 and 2 Chronicles.
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:25.200]   Nehemiah wrote the book of Nehemiah.
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:30.640]   Psalm writers include David, Asaph, Sons of Korah, Ethan, Heman.
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:35.280]   Solomon wrote some of the Psalms, most of the Proverbs.
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.840]   Ecclesiastes, Song of Solomon.
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:42.840]   Agur and Lemuel wrote some of the Proverbs.
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:47.640]   Then all the prophets wrote the books by their own name.
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:50.640]   Isaiah, Jeremiah, who also wrote Lamentations.
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:58.840]   Ezekiel, Daniel, Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah,
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.680]   Haggai, Zechariah.
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:08.000]   Then the writers of the Gospels in the New Testament, Matthew, Mark, Luke, who also wrote
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   Acts.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.600]   In fact, it's interesting, if you were to ask most people who wrote most of the New
[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:16.080]   Testament, they'd probably say Paul because he wrote 13 letters.
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:21.740]   But actually Luke wrote most of the New Testament because the book of Luke and Acts together
[00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:26.200]   comprise more of the New Testament than any other author, which is, in passing, I'll tell
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.960]   you why we named our first son Luke.
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:30.280]   But nobody calls him Luke anymore.
[00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:31.600]   They call him Carsten.
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.440]   Okay, you didn't ask for that little piece of information.
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:41.280]   But Paul wrote those 13 letters, and James, the Lord's brother, wrote a letter, and finally
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.740]   Peter and Jude.
[00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:47.200]   Those are the human authors who wrote the Bible.
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:53.440]   But here's one of the most important things, and I'll end with this, that needs to be said.
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:10:00.120]   Just as the heavens are telling the glory of God, so that we should be able to look
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:04.880]   at nature and discern in it the hand of God.
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:13.280]   And just as John said of Jesus Christ, "We beheld his glory, glory as of the only Son
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:20.520]   from the Father," so that those who saw Jesus should have discerned that this is the Son
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:31.320]   of God, in the same way, the glory of God shines forth from his handiwork in the very
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:39.880]   Word of God that he inspired the Bible through the human authors, so that we can say in a
[00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:48.400]   similar way that we have seen here, the hand of God, the truth of God, this is his Word.
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:52.840]   We surveyed the Bible and how we got it, and how it self-authenticates itself as well.
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:54.840]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for listening.

[00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:13.140]   We return on Wednesday to look at one of the key doctrines that will immunize each of us
[00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:17.320]   against man-centered false teaching.
[00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:24.400]   See you then.
