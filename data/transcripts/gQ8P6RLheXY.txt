[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.720]   Welcome back to Portfolio Rescue.
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.080]   Today's show is sponsored by Innovator ETFs.
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.920]   Innovator actually has some ETFs that might be appealing for the current market.
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.760]   So they have these buffer ETFs, Duncan.
[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.460]   And what they do is they allow you to pick a downside protection, and then it comes with
[00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.460]   a cap on the upside.
[00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.740]   The greater the downside protection, the lower the cap you get on the upside.
[00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.600]   This way you can essentially put a range on your return, so you know what your returns
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.640]   are going to be depending on what happens in the stock market.
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.080]   So it's both a way to protect against further losses if the market keeps falling apart,
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.680]   or if the market actually stops going down for once and goes up, you can actually still
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.120]   take part in the rise.
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.520]   So it doesn't mean you know exactly what the return is going to be, because the market
[00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.240]   is still uncertain, but you can essentially put a range on your returns to know, "I'm
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.680]   protected to this amount, and I'm also capped to this amount on the upside."
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.680]   So they call them defined outcomes, so you actually know ahead of time.
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.080]   Whatever the stock market does, you kind of have a sense of what your losses and gains
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.260]   could be.
[00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.600]   So to learn more, go to Innovator ETFs, or actually search through Animal Spirits Archive
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.800]   and listen to Michael and I discuss their strategies with their CEO and founder, Bruce
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:17.800]   Bond.
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.400]   Also, double promo there, they're also an official sponsor of Future Proof Festival.
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.920]   Ah yeah, so it'll be out there in September, looking forward to that.
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:33.160]   So I'm coming to you live today from Chicago, and if we're basing a recession indicator
[00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.100]   on the number of beers people drink at a Cubs game, I still say no recession.
[00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.920]   But maybe the opposite is true, that people just drink more when things are getting bad.
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.080]   What's a beer at a Cubs game, like $12, $14?
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.280]   Actually, inflation there was already really high.
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.780]   Like a normal New York City beer, basically.
[00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.760]   So this is a show where we allow the audience to dictate what we're going to talk about
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.200]   every week, right?
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.580]   And this week, people want to talk about the housing market.
[00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.240]   So we have a collection of your questions, and they build up over time, but we also separate
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.200]   out what are the new questions every week.
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.640]   And this week, every single new question was about the housing market.
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.680]   So we're going to get into some questions on that, but I just want to talk about this
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.480]   a little bit before we get into it, because the housing market has just utterly fascinated
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.480]   me right now.
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.680]   So coming into the year, the 30-year fixed rate mortgage was 3%, call it.
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.280]   Less than six months later, this week I saw it quoted by some sources 6.3%.
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.660]   This is just an insanely fast move, and probably one of the most important borrowing rates
[00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.080]   for the majority of people that are consuming debt.
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.160]   So let's look at an example to show the impact of what this means, a more than doubling of
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.160]   rates.
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.200]   So I looked at some different housing prices here, from 300 up to 700,000, and I looked
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.120]   at the monthly payment at 3%, again, less than six months ago, and the monthly payment
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.960]   at 6.3%.
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:54.440]   You can see it ranges from an increase of $500 to $1,200 a month, which is like a 47%
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.440]   increase.
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.280]   A year, we're talking like more than $6,000 at the low end, or $14,000 or $15,000 at the
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.200]   high end, in terms of an increase.
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.480]   So let's think about this another way.
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:10.880]   The median existing home price in January 2021 was like $313,000, like median amount.
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.120]   The mortgage rate at that point was 2.7%.
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.840]   Let's say you do a 10% down payment.
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.720]   I kind of used that in the other example as well.
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.520]   That's like an $1,100 monthly payment.
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.520]   Now the median existing home price is closer to $400,000, the mortgage rate, again, 6.3%.
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.960]   Put 10% down, we're talking $2,200.
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:34.960]   So in a little less than 18 months, the monthly payment has effectively doubled, and to make
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:43.680]   these monthly payments equal, with rates staying at 6.3%, that price would have to fall 45%.
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:50.120]   I mean, so let's say you bought a house for $500,000 three years ago, and you got a 3%
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.480]   mortgage, and you put, again, your 10% down.
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.880]   Your monthly payment at that point would be like $1,900.
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:55.880]   You can do a chart off, John.
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.680]   I don't need this one anymore.
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.080]   Now let's say you're forced to move and get a new job, and you say, "You know what?
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.600]   I want to keep that same $1,900 payment.
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:11.320]   What can I afford at a 6.3% mortgage that goes from a $500,000 house at 3% to a $340,000
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.320]   house?"
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.680]   So people didn't really have time to acclimate to this.
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.160]   It wasn't like a slow, stair-step approach to go up.
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.640]   It just, it shot up.
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.040]   I guess there was someone talking, we talked about Animal Spirits this week, 60 basis points
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.320]   in two days for mortgage rates.
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.000]   This has basically never happened this fast, where mortgage rates have doubled.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.360]   So I'm just going to be fascinated to see what happens.
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.360]   Will people with 3% mortgages just simply never move?
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.640]   Will, like, buyers decide to say, "No, thank you"?
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.360]   Will the housing market, like, grind to a halt?
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.920]   I honestly don't know.
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.080]   I mean, obviously people still need to buy a home if they want to settle down and have
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.240]   a family and own their own place and move for a job or whatever the reason.
[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.120]   But I'm just fascinated to see what will happen here, because I don't think people thought
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.400]   through the ramifications, and Powell talked about it a little bit at his press conference
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.520]   yesterday for the Fed, and how we need to slow the housing market.
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.560]   But this is, to me, kind of a careful what you wish for situation.
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.840]   I think this is going to be not great.
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.040]   Yeah, it's all relative to you, right?
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.240]   Because like you're saying, you know, rent is continuing to go up too, right?
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:17.280]   So yeah, I mean, housing has gone up and buying a house is more, you know, unaffordable than
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.280]   in a long time.
[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.840]   But yeah, if your rent is also skyrocketing, then yeah, I guess it's kind of a relative
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:23.840]   thing.
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:24.840]   Yeah.
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:25.840]   We've got a few questions on that.
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:26.840]   Remember, if you have a question, askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:27.840]   We're going to get into some questions like that.
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.800]   Someone in the chat asked where I am.
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.440]   I am in the West Loop in Chicago.
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.120]   So got the L train behind me, right?
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:40.480]   It's a, by the way, one of the best summer cities in the country, easily, Chicago is
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.480]   just gorgeous.
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:42.480]   All right.
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.480]   Let's do first question.
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.240]   Yeah, I love the architecture there, especially the Hancock building.
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.400]   That's a cool building.
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.400]   Okay.
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.120]   Here's our first question, or yeah, here's our next question.
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.280]   Is there a way to hedge the price of my home?
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.320]   It has appreciated a lot over the past couple of years.
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.360]   And my hunch is that its value will pull back in the coming months.
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:06.240]   I had a similar hunch about interest rates a year ago, and there are products, TBT, I
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.320]   don't know what that is, to bet on treasury selling off.
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.040]   This year, the no-brainer trade is housing prices dropping.
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.040]   How do I play it?
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.040]   All right.
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.240]   So the TBT is you could do like an inverse treasuries.
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.880]   If you thought rates are going to rise, treasuries are going to go down, you could bet against
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:19.880]   them.
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:23.000]   There really aren't many products like this for housing.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.240]   And obviously, based on the examples that I just gave, maybe some people think, well,
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.600]   housing prices are going to have to fall.
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.840]   I still don't know if that's a foregone conclusion.
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:30.840]   It's certainly a possibility.
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.960]   I do think some people are just going to say, I'm not putting my house up for sale, and
[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.760]   it's just going to be like this.
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.640]   The supply is going to be really low.
[00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:41.440]   So maybe you could see some of the ones that sell go for lower prices.
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.080]   And I would be shocked if we didn't see a ton of price cuts in the months and weeks
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.280]   ahead from people saying, listen, it's got to be lower because my mortgage rates are
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:48.280]   higher.
[00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.640]   But does that mean that nationwide housing prices have to fall 10% or 15%?
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.000]   I don't know.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.320]   It's possible.
[00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.800]   But I still think people could just sit it out.
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:55.800]   Well, let's say you're right.
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.200]   Housing prices fall 5% or 10% from here.
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.920]   Let's say, again, the median existing home price is $400,000.
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:04.600]   We're talking $20,000 to $40,000 loss, right?
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:05.880]   You want to protect that.
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:09.680]   I'm going to ignore the big short type of trades where you buy credit defaults like
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.000]   Steve Eisemann or whatever.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.760]   I'm sure you could come up with a bunch of sector bets that would maybe benefit if the
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.320]   housing market fell.
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:23.320]   But I think timing this stuff is just as hard as figuring out the direction of the trade.
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.240]   You could be directionally right, but timing is wrong.
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:28.040]   So here's some simple hedges you could do.
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:31.400]   Right now, you could just take out a home equity on a credit and pull some of that off
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.680]   the table, right?
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:34.960]   You're taking cash out.
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.520]   You're lowering your exposure to the housing market.
[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.080]   You could put that money elsewhere and diversify.
[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:41.560]   Now, obviously, borrowing rates for HELOCs are going to be much higher now.
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:42.840]   That stuff is going up.
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.360]   But that seems like a good way to diversify your personal balance sheet.
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:50.120]   You could sell your home, unfortunately, as the examples I already gave.
[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:51.120]   Downsizing might not help.
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:55.600]   You could say, "I'm going to downsize," but with mortgage rates double, downsizing might
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:59.080]   give you the same monthly payment as a more expensive home right now, which is kind of
[00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:00.080]   crazy.
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:02.120]   And obviously, as you mentioned, Dunkin' rents are rising.
[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:06.720]   So I think you could also say, "I'm going to pay my mortgage off as slowly as possible.
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.440]   I'm not going to make any extra payments.
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:13.040]   There's no reason for me to pay it off if I have this low mortgage rate."
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.480]   And finally, you could just do nothing, right?
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:16.480]   You could ride it out.
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:19.840]   You don't have to be a hedge fund manager with your house, right?
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.640]   Just live in your home for more than five to seven years.
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:23.640]   Guess what?
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:27.000]   In that time, the price is probably going to be higher than it is today, and you don't
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   have to think through that.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.640]   So I wish I had a sexy answer here for how to hedge the housing market, but I think your
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:37.560]   own personal house, there's really not much you can do besides just have a longer time
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:38.560]   horizon.
[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:43.000]   And if there are some fluctuations in the next year or 18 months or 24 months, it's
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   not going to impact you anyway because you're living there, right?
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   It's not like you have to sell.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.360]   And it's not like you see the price fluctuate every day like you do in the stock market.
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:54.320]   So this is the kind of thing where I don't think you have to have an answer for this
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.320]   kind of thing.
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:09:00.240]   >> It also, it kind of reminds me of our question from last week about hedging medical costs
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.240]   for the future.
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:06.080]   Someone was asking if they should buy health care stocks to hedge against rising health
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.080]   care costs.
[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:10.760]   It's like, think about if you'd bought Zillow and a bunch of housing-related stocks to try
[00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:12.800]   to hedge the housing market.
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:16.320]   It just wouldn't have worked out very well, I guess.
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:19.360]   And that was like the opposite, where the housing market was doing great and you bought
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:23.720]   Zillow and like, hand up, I'm an idiot over here who did that, and it didn't work out.
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:24.720]   So yeah, so that's the thing.
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:27.840]   You could be directionally right about the housing market going down and still not get
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:30.920]   the hedge right because the market doesn't react in the way that you think it will.
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.080]   All right, let's do another one.
[00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:34.080]   >> Okay.
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:38.400]   Up next, we have my wife and I are six and a half.
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.760]   >> By the way, good fugitive joke in the chat here.
[00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:41.760]   >> Good fugitive joke?
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.360]   >> Well, because he was in Chicago on the train.
[00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:45.360]   Not bad.
[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.360]   >> Yeah, that's an old one.
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:47.360]   I haven't seen that in forever.
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.360]   >> Yeah, good one.
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:51.240]   >> Okay, my wife and I are 68 and have been retired for 15 years.
[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:57.480]   We have a net worth of $6 million, of which about $4.4 million is liquid, and the remainder
[00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:00.080]   is equity in our two homes.
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:05.200]   We are both on Social Security of $44,000 per year combined, have zero debt, and spent
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:08.360]   about 2% of our portfolio last year.
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:13.040]   We have had a diversified portfolio and 60/40 asset allocation since we retired.
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:16.080]   We're moderately aggressive investors and are both in good health.
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:19.720]   I would like to think we have another 20 years in retirement.
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:25.000]   Our required minimum distributions will be quite large when we hit 72, but we are maximizing
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.040]   our Roth conversions based on tax brackets and remaining in the lowest Medicare premium
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.320]   bracket.
[00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:33.340]   My question is regarding our 60/40 asset allocation.
[00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:37.720]   As we continue to age, does it make sense to de-risk our portfolio by decreasing equity
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:42.480]   exposure since we don't have the years to recover from serious market downturns?
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:46.680]   We've been buying in the current down market, doing early Roth conversions and tax-loss
[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:47.680]   harvesting.
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:48.680]   There's a lot there.
[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:49.680]   There's a lot there.
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:50.680]   Yeah.
[00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:52.600]   Well, first off, again, this is our weekly nicely done, right?
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:54.960]   This person seems to have their finances in order.
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:58.520]   I think many investment advisors would be salivating at numbers like these.
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:00.720]   I think a lot of people would offer you a solution saying, "Yeah, yeah.
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:03.680]   You need to put your portfolio into this fund and that fund and that product, and here's
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:06.480]   the allocation you need, and look at how smart I am."
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:10.360]   With information like this, I have one simple question like, "What's the end goal here?"
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:14.240]   It's like a squishy question, but that's the right place to start because it's really impossible
[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.080]   to offer investment advice without attaching it to your goals.
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.040]   It's like, "What do you want to get out of your money?"
[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:19.440]   You already said you don't spend that much.
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:22.960]   You're spending 2% a year, but do you plan on spending it all before you die?
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:24.400]   Do you want to give it away to charity?
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:28.280]   Do you have kids that you're looking for and offer an inheritance so maybe you could even
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:30.400]   make your portfolio riskier?
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:33.640]   It sounds cliche to say it's really difficult to offer portfolio management to someone without
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:37.560]   understanding their risk profile and time horizon, but you can't just enter this stuff
[00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:40.120]   into a spreadsheet and spit out an allocation.
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:42.000]   Also, how much do you want to de-risk?
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.520]   John, throw up this first chart here.
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:49.240]   This shows the difference between ... I did a globally diversified 60/40, 50/50, and 40/60
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:52.560]   portfolio this year, and these are the drawdowns as of yesterday.
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:56.200]   You can see it's 18%, 17%, 16% call it.
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:58.520]   There's not much difference because bonds are selling off too.
[00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:00.200]   Now, let's do the next one, John.
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:05.000]   This is obviously a little bit of a crazy market because bonds are falling.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.520]   This is actually during the corona crash in March 2020.
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:13.320]   You can see there's a little bit more of a difference, so a 40/60 portfolio fell 15%,
[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:18.720]   or 50/50 fell almost 18%, and then a 60/40 fell more than 20%.
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:21.840]   You can see a little difference there.
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:28.960]   I think figuring out what de-risking means, how much is that going to help you and how
[00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:32.600]   much of that change is really going to ... I think to really de-risk and see a huge change,
[00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:38.040]   you're going to have a 20/80 or 30/70 kind of portfolio.
[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:42.280]   If that makes sense, fine, or do you want to just hold more cash to see you through
[00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:43.280]   this stuff?
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:44.280]   You said you're still buying.
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:47.560]   They seem to be handling the bear market okay.
[00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:54.880]   I just think you have to think through what are you trying to do here, and when is this
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:58.360]   money going to be spent, and then you can figure out, okay, does it really make sense
[00:12:58.360 --> 00:12:59.360]   to do?
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:02.160]   Obviously, a lot of the target date funds, they do a glide path where they slowly de-risk
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:03.440]   over time.
[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:09.080]   That certainly makes sense, but I think you have to think through what change does it
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:14.200]   actually make if I go from 60/40 to 40/60, or what can actually have a big impact on
[00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.120]   that returns, and what are you trying to get out of it?
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:17.120]   Are you trying to reduce drawdowns?
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:18.560]   Are you trying to reduce volatility?
[00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:20.200]   I'd think of it through that way.
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.200]   Yeah.
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:25.080]   It sounds like, like you said, it sounds like they've done pretty well to date.
[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:26.080]   Yeah.
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:27.720]   They're doing something right, I guess.
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:29.920]   Let's do another one.
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:30.920]   Okay.
[00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:34.640]   Up next, we have a question from someone from New Zealand, which immediately makes
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:38.000]   me think of "Fly the Conchords," which is one of my all-time favorite shows.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   I can see that.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   I can see you liking that show, Duncan.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   I love that show.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.480]   I recently started watching "What We Do in the Shadows," which has some of the same
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:45.480]   people.
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:46.480]   So, good show.
[00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:48.840]   I'm 30 years old, living in New Zealand.
[00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:51.600]   The New Zealand housing market has taken a rocket during the pandemic.
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:56.200]   I guess that's like a New Zealand phrase, taken a rocket during the pandemic.
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:57.200]   I'm going to steal that one.
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.200]   Yeah.
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.200]   I like that.
[00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:02.760]   The New Zealand housing market has taken a rocket during the pandemic and has an average
[00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:05.500]   house price of over $1 million across the country.
[00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:08.200]   I live in Auckland, where this is even higher.
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:10.360]   The median salary is $70,000.
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:15.480]   My partner and I pull in roughly $170,000 to $190,000 annually.
[00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:21.840]   We rent, have approximately $70,000 to $80,000 of savings and assets, and save about $400
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:23.400]   a week between us.
[00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:29.380]   Do we enjoy our very first overseas experience, get away for a month and reset mentally?
[00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:35.100]   Do we improve our living conditions and buy some nicer furniture, eat out, go to gigs,
[00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:38.660]   and just enjoy living while slowly adding to savings?
[00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:42.760]   Do we tighten everything up, invest everything we can, and focus on buying a home over the
[00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:44.420]   next two years?
[00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:49.160]   Another option is to try to move to a cheaper city in New Zealand to buy a home for $700,000
[00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:53.600]   but finding a good job in smaller cities may be difficult.
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:54.600]   All right.
[00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:59.300]   If you think housing prices are crazy here, John, let's do a chart on of this is real
[00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:05.600]   housing prices versus real disposable income in New Zealand, and now let's show the US.
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:07.280]   Housing prices are in blue.
[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:08.280]   Income is in red.
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:10.640]   You can see housing prices are far above disposable income.
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:12.840]   Now, let's show the next one, John, to show the US.
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:13.840]   All right.
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:17.640]   I'm going to flip back a couple of times.
[00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:19.400]   New Zealand is just off the charts.
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:23.120]   The United States is actually real disposable income and real housing prices are pretty
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:24.440]   close to each other.
[00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:26.200]   In New Zealand, it's just off the chart.
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:30.000]   I definitely feel for our New Zealand person here.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.960]   Sometimes we have to shorten these questions because they give so much information.
[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:35.560]   I actually said their rent is about $650 a month, so they're not paying a ton.
[00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:37.600]   I actually like the way that they're thinking here.
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:43.720]   It's like, do I put my life on hold financially and experience-wise and save a ton just so
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:45.720]   we can afford a house?
[00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:48.000]   Or do we just ignore that?
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.480]   We don't have to buy a house because we feel peer pressure, and we can just enjoy the flexibility
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:53.480]   of renting.
[00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:55.040]   We can get a nice Airbnb every once in a while.
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:56.280]   We can travel overseas.
[00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:57.280]   We can get some nice furniture.
[00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:58.280]   We can go out to eat more.
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:02.180]   I actually think that's not a bad way to think about this.
[00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:05.360]   Not everyone has to buy a home.
[00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:06.680]   It's not for everyone.
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:10.960]   Maybe instead of buying an expensive home, you travel more and you treat yourself better
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:14.600]   and calculate the difference between what you're paying in rent each year versus mortgage,
[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:16.920]   insurance, taxes, and think about which scenario would make you happier.
[00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:20.640]   Some people will still feel like saving for two years and buying a home and penny-pinching
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:21.960]   makes sense.
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:24.240]   But I think a lot of this depends on how much you really want to buy a house versus how
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:26.960]   much you think you have to buy a house because that's the next step and everyone else is
[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:27.960]   doing it.
[00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:31.800]   Especially in a place like that that's so expensive, I don't know, maybe resetting mentally
[00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:35.880]   and traveling overseas for the first time is gonna be more enjoyable for you than settling
[00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:36.880]   down and buying a house.
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:40.800]   But I think, again, I think a lot of people assume they have to buy a house because it's
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:43.680]   the next step or because everyone else did it and because it's the biggest investment
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:44.680]   you make.
[00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:45.680]   But you don't have to.
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:46.680]   It's not for everyone.
[00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:47.680]   - Yeah.
[00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:50.960]   Yeah, and I mean, there's obviously a lot of variables there, but to me, yeah, the idea
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:55.880]   of getting to travel the world, that's something that you're gonna remember the rest of your
[00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:56.880]   life.
[00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:01.440]   And so, yeah, to me, that's the thing that's appealing to me out of those options.
[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:04.760]   But yeah, you also don't want to live in a place where you're miserable and you have
[00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:07.680]   neighbors who are super loud, keeping you up every night.
[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:09.600]   So it's definitely, it's a complicated kind of loaded--
[00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:11.560]   - Yeah, trade-offs, as in most things.
[00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:14.720]   But I like the way they're thinking about this in terms of, well, what if I just enjoyed
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:17.960]   myself a little more and spent some of that money I would be saving for a house or on
[00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:21.160]   mortgage payments and property taxes and just enjoy myself in other ways?
[00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:23.120]   I think that's not a bad way to think about it.
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:24.120]   - Right, yeah.
[00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:25.120]   - I mean, that's like in college.
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:28.140]   You live in a crappy dorm, but then you have all this other stuff around you that's kind
[00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:31.360]   of fun and you handle that living situation.
[00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:34.240]   Not saying that renting in New Zealand is gonna be that bad, but I think that makes
[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:35.240]   a lot of sense.
[00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:36.240]   All right, let's do another one.
[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:37.240]   - Yeah.
[00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:38.240]   Yeah, I know.
[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:39.240]   Good advice.
[00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:40.240]   Okay.
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:44.840]   "I'm constantly reading about how you don't need to invest in foreign or international
[00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:48.700]   stocks since S&P 500 companies do business abroad.
[00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:52.080]   On a past episode, you mentioned that it is important to hold foreign stocks.
[00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:55.760]   My question is, how much of your portfolio should be in foreign stocks?
[00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:58.680]   Do you believe half, since that's closer to the global weight?
[00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:01.280]   How much do you personally have allocated to foreign stocks?"
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:05.440]   - Ooh, putting it on the table here, okay.
[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:06.440]   Let's bring in some help here.
[00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:10.520]   I have Ben Coulthard again, who's gonna come on to help us think through this one.
[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:11.520]   - Many markets.
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:15.080]   - 'Cause these are questions that we have with our clients as well, like how much does
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:16.560]   it make sense to be allocated?
[00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:21.400]   So I actually had a conversation yesterday, and someone was saying, you know, "I read
[00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:26.120]   Ray Dalio's book, and he's making it sound like every empire eventually fails, and what
[00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:28.520]   happens if the US empire fails?"
[00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:33.480]   And I said, "Well, that would not be great, but also, diversify internationally.
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:38.480]   That's your, because if the US does fail, boy, this has been a depressing week, hasn't
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:39.480]   it?
[00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:40.480]   We're talking about the fall of the economy."
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:41.640]   - Yeah, you're bumming me out.
[00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:45.000]   - But if we fell from grace, guess what?
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.760]   Some other country would probably benefit from that.
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:51.480]   So Ben, when you talk to clients and work them through this, how do you talk about the
[00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:56.040]   allocation in terms of investing overseas versus investing in the US, and how we think
[00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:57.040]   about that?
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:02.040]   - Yeah, that's great stuff, and that's classic Dalio, by the way.
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:03.480]   I actually like to do this.
[00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:05.440]   I like to talk about real companies.
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:10.840]   I get the whole American companies do business overseas thing, and thus you have international
[00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:13.240]   exposure, but it works the other way, too.
[00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:18.600]   I mean, Apple, yeah, they sell phones to Korea, but Samsung sells phones here.
[00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:21.720]   BMW, Mercedes, ever heard of them?
[00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:26.640]   I got Unilever all over my bathroom in the form of Dove, which makes great deodorant
[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:28.960]   and soap, by the way.
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:29.960]   Let's see, what else?
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:31.120]   My girlfriend's 30th birthday is coming up.
[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:34.680]   I'm probably going to have to hit Louis Vuitton because they know their fashion over in Paris.
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:37.200]   Probably going to have to hit a Shell gas station on the way there.
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.760]   You get the point.
[00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:45.720]   We sell to them, they sell to us, and as far as the allocation goes, I mean, my 401(k)
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:50.680]   is basically VT, which is the Vanguard Global Stock Market Index.
[00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:54.440]   It's like 60% US, 40% international, but how well do you-
[00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:58.320]   - Yeah, that's the global weight as far as what the market itself is.
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:01.880]   The US is like 60%, the international is 40%.
[00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:05.520]   I think that's not a bad place to start and figure out whether you want to shade more
[00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:09.540]   US or shade more internationally because you think the US has done so well.
[00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:13.440]   So I think that's a good starting point to figure out which way you want to go from.
[00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:14.440]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:19.560]   The bulk of my accounts are in a world global stock market.
[00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:24.480]   Yeah, when I'm buying Google and Tesla and the gambling, the sidecar account that we
[00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:29.320]   talked about last time, that probably tilts me a little bit more US.
[00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:35.320]   But help me out here, Smarter Ben, 100 years ago, didn't the US make up 25% or 30% of the
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:36.320]   global stock market?
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:37.960]   Maybe it was 120 years ago or something.
[00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:41.000]   - The United Kingdom was the biggest stock market in the world.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:46.080]   And even 30 years ago, Japan was giving us a run for our money.
[00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:48.640]   Japan was, I've mentioned this before, was 45% of the total.
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:53.880]   So yeah, the US doesn't have to dominate like it has, and that doesn't mean we have to fall
[00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:54.880]   from...
[00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:57.200]   Our empire has to crumble like Ray Dalio thinks.
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:00.680]   It can just be that US stocks don't perform quite as well.
[00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:04.120]   Also Ben, was that a humble brag saying that you're going to go to Louis Vuitton for your
[00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:05.120]   girlfriend's birthday?
[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:06.120]   - Yeah.
[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:07.120]   - I think so.
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:08.120]   - Is that even still in?
[00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:11.680]   I actually would love some user feedback from the women in the chat, if that's the right
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:12.680]   move.
[00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:14.040]   - Am I doing like Balenciaga now?
[00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:17.960]   - Dude, you're losing me with Balenciaga, San Diegan.
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:18.960]   - All right.
[00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:22.480]   So someone in the chart asked me if I'm wearing a tie, must just be because I'm not wearing
[00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:23.480]   a tie.
[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:27.840]   It's probably the pandemic that I threw away all my ties and I'm never wearing one again.
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:32.160]   - I'm actually moving into Charlestown with my girlfriend and I just threw out all my
[00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:33.160]   ties.
[00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:34.160]   So why would I ever wear one again?
[00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:38.200]   - I mean, if your neck gets cold a lot, I guess it could be useful.
[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:39.200]   - Yeah.
[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:42.040]   No, it's a noose, dude.
[00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:45.960]   So my approach is like, look, don't try to be a hero and make geographical calls.
[00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:48.160]   You're not Ray Dalio, neither am I.
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:53.880]   I actually, you know, I did own the India ETF like five or six years ago because, you
[00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:58.640]   know, I read like their middle class was going to grow into like China's or something.
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:00.000]   Basically dead money for three years.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.760]   I just dumped it only to see it then go higher.
[00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:05.800]   Like, I don't know, we should just do less.
[00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:10.080]   That's primarily global market weighting is just doing less.
[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:14.720]   My last little comment is like, as far as whether to own the world through like one
[00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:21.560]   vehicle like a VT or, you know, whether you own like separate U.S. funds and international
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:25.680]   funds and like do the rebalance thing, like, I don't know if you really want autopilot,
[00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:26.680]   which is what I prefer.
[00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:29.480]   Like I just let, I just own it in one vehicle.
[00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:34.200]   As Ben said, if the U.S. like grows and Europe shrinks, like it'll all be reflected.
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:39.360]   I understand the case for rebalancing, but, you know, look, this all gets summed up in
[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:40.360]   a one thing.
[00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:43.360]   What if the next NVIDIA is not domiciled in the United States?
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:48.440]   That is why, in a nutshell, I have, you know, a meaningful enough exposure internationally.
[00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:49.440]   Yeah.
[00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:50.440]   I agree.
[00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:53.440]   And people across all across the world get up every day trying to improve their station
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:54.440]   in life as well.
[00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:56.120]   It doesn't mean that we're anything special here.
[00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:57.120]   So yeah.
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:01.560]   So to summarize, you're saying you basically just pick the country you think will surpass
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:03.920]   the U.S. and then bet on that one.
[00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:04.920]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:05.920]   Yes.
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:06.920]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:07.920]   OK.
[00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:10.720]   So that question was from Angel, by the way.
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:16.720]   So last but not least, what type of allocation changes do you make to your portfolio during
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:17.800]   bear markets?
[00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:22.440]   I'm in my early 40s, didn't have much to invest during the financial crisis and have only
[00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:26.440]   experienced V-shaped crashes and recoveries with real dollars at stake.
[00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:28.880]   I feel both paralyzed and compelled to take action.
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:30.320]   I have a feeling you're not alone.
[00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:31.920]   No, certainly not.
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:36.080]   And that could be people who this is their first bear market, real bear market, I guess,
[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:39.080]   if you want to say, or you've been through a bunch of them.
[00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:42.040]   It doesn't make it any easier.
[00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:46.320]   I will say, here's the way that I look at this.
[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:50.680]   You build your portfolio and investment plan to withstand bear markets and recessions and
[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:52.120]   inflation and deflation.
[00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:55.520]   The whole point is having a durable enough plan that you don't have to try to guess it
[00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:56.520]   in advance.
[00:23:56.520 --> 00:24:00.040]   And I think the idea that you're going to change your portfolio in a bear market and
[00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:05.420]   make the right call and the right hedges and all these things, it sounds great in theory.
[00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:09.460]   It rarely works in practice, even for the people that do this for a living and they're
[00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:10.460]   hedge fund managers.
[00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:11.460]   A lot of times those people can't.
[00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:17.480]   So Ben, let's say you have a younger client come to you and say, "This is my first experience
[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:19.480]   with this.
[00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:20.480]   I had some savings.
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:21.480]   I'm seeing real dollars fall."
[00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:25.920]   That's one of the problems with growing your savings over time is that the bear gets, even
[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:30.000]   for a lower percentage decline, it's a much bigger money.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.040]   It's the dollars and cents versus percentage.
[00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:35.300]   So people who have these real dollars at stake, how do you handle that with people who are
[00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:39.740]   going through this for the first time as someone who's on your level in that similar younger
[00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:40.740]   age group?
[00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:43.040]   Well, I say I feel you.
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:46.400]   This market has me both nauseous and giddy at the same time, too.
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:50.040]   You'd actually have to be a sociopath from one of those true crime Netflix documentaries
[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:52.500]   if you don't feel anything.
[00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:58.280]   We are still those same animals from 20,000 years ago running around the Serengeti.
[00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:00.840]   You hear a noise in the bushes, you're taken off.
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:02.400]   I didn't read the book Sapiens.
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:03.400]   I glanced at it.
[00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:04.400]   I get the gist.
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:08.080]   By the way, you can't own crypto until you read it.
[00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:09.080]   Sorry.
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:10.080]   That's a rule.
[00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:11.080]   Yeah.
[00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:13.320]   That was also a little Don't Jump reference from Wedding Crashers.
[00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:14.560]   I glanced at it.
[00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:20.280]   But yeah, look, the noisy bushes, to continue the metaphor, are all around us, the TV, the
[00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:21.280]   phone.
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:23.800]   I got group chats going off, wanting to go to cash.
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:27.600]   I can blow out of my entire portfolio right now, Ben, with a few clicks, whilst live on
[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:29.760]   YouTube, I can go to 100% cash.
[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:35.640]   So you have that, then you consider that losing money feels twice as bad as making money feels
[00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:37.640]   good.
[00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:41.600]   When I was up 1,000% in Tesla last year, not a big deal.
[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:44.120]   That was almost like, yeah, that's why I bought it.
[00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:47.720]   But now when it retraces 40% this year, it's like the Happy Gilmore, like here comes the
[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:48.720]   putter throw.
[00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:55.120]   So I don't know, this mental civil war that's going on is even why the simplest investing
[00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:56.120]   is hard.
[00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:58.240]   If it were easy, everyone would be rich, right?
[00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:01.280]   This is the price you pay for those long-term returns.
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:05.760]   And I think that the hard thing to wrap your head around, this is a very obvious statement,
[00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:09.160]   but if you look back historically over the last hundred years, the US stock market is
[00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:11.460]   up nine or 10% per year, right?
[00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:17.400]   And that includes depressions and wars and inflation and deflation and nasty bear markets
[00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:18.400]   and crashes.
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:20.160]   It includes all of that.
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:24.640]   And so sticking with a plan and sticking with your investments through a bear market, that's
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:26.720]   just a requirement to earn those long-term returns.
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:30.480]   And it really stinks because this market just feels, it's just brutal, right?
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:33.560]   It's almost soul sucking in a lot of ways, because it just feels like you feel like it's
[00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:35.520]   never going to get better.
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:37.720]   You feel like it never stops going down.
[00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:41.560]   There's barely reprieve and then it just goes down again.
[00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:42.800]   But it's always felt like that.
[00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:45.360]   And you look back historically and you go, oh, of course, that one was a great buying
[00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:46.360]   opportunity.
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:47.360]   That was a great buying opportunity.
[00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:48.760]   And I should have held through that one.
[00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:51.880]   But it's a lot harder to do it in real time because we don't know the end date.
[00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:53.560]   We don't know when it's going to be over.
[00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:58.880]   And so I think the whole point is, everything in life revolves around trade-offs.
[00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:02.800]   And I think just having some balance and understanding this is going to happen, and especially if
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:05.560]   you're 40 years old and this is retirement savings, you're not going to be touching it
[00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:08.920]   for three or four decades, potentially.
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:12.040]   I think you have to understand that you're going to have a lot of these in the years
[00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:13.040]   ahead.
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:18.320]   And you either figure out an asset allocation that can see you through them, or just get
[00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:21.200]   better at dealing with the pain because it's not going away.
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:27.080]   Yeah, as you said, this century, frankly, is a kick-walk compared to last century.
[00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:31.900]   The Dow has still gone from 30,000 to 30,000 over the last 120 years, despite everything.
[00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:38.320]   So I boiled all this down to two rules for literally anyone at any age when we're in
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:40.160]   a situation like this.
[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:44.640]   Number one, cash feels like a nice, warm blanket right now.
[00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:48.160]   But in the long run, it is a coffin, all right?
[00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:49.160]   Quote that.
[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:50.880]   That's like some Morgan Housel stuff right there.
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:55.720]   I'm down for an emergency savings blanket, even a queen-size one if you have a family
[00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:57.760]   to provide for.
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:00.880]   As a strategic allocation, that's a no for me, dawg.
[00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:05.680]   Cash is a tool to acquire things, whether that be dinner tonight, whether that be five
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:07.800]   shares of SPY.
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:12.000]   But if you're sitting on a huge cash hoard, you better be about to buy a house or pay
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.960]   for a wedding or something.
[00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:18.160]   If you're waiting for a real crash or waiting for the dust to settle, you need to lose your
[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:19.160]   account password.
[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:20.160]   All right?
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:23.440]   Or that Michael Jordan gif, the "Stop it.
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:24.440]   Get some help."
[00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:29.880]   I do think not looking at your 401(k) balance is about as good as you can do right now.
[00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:30.880]   But yeah.
[00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:32.880]   I just love my 401(k) contributions, frankly.
[00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:37.640]   Yeah, I'm not trying to look at the balance, but yeah, that's a little thing you can do.
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:41.240]   Rule number two, this kind of gets to what you're talking about, Ben, like putting some
[00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:43.520]   math and sobriety behind it.
[00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:48.760]   It's actually from our own Nick Magiuli, which this is a very underrated clip of him on the
[00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:51.440]   Jim O'Shaughnessy podcast, Infinite Loops.
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:56.360]   He's like to anyone who's panicking, he would ask this question, like, "Do you think markets
[00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:57.360]   will eventually recover?
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:01.540]   Do you think at some point ever again we'll be at all-time highs?"
[00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:03.920]   If the answer is no, don't invest then.
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:06.600]   Go buy a bunker and fill it with cans of Chef Boyardee.
[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:08.200]   Enjoy your life.
[00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:12.360]   If you do, okay, well then, you know, over what time frame?
[00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:13.360]   Maybe two years?
[00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:14.360]   Like, fine.
[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:18.280]   We're in a 20%-ish drawdown right now.
[00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:24.120]   If it takes until the summer of 2024 to get back to new all-time highs, that's a 12% annualized
[00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:28.040]   return from here, regardless of the path, even if we go down another 10.
[00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:33.320]   If you're telling me we're at new highs in the summer of 2024 from here, that's 12% from
[00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:36.200]   here on out, above market average.
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:41.960]   Let's say we end up falling 33%, like we did in 2020, and say it takes five years to get
[00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:42.960]   back.
[00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:48.220]   Summer of 2027, you're still getting a 9% return each year from here.
[00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:49.220]   That's like market average.
[00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:50.220]   It's above average.
[00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:54.840]   So, like, it's hard, like I said, to keep that sober math in mind, but frankly, as simple
[00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:57.840]   as the leaner the recent returns, the fatter the future returns.
[00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:01.240]   Yeah, it's hard to think, but expect returns are going up as stocks are going down.
[00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:02.240]   It's no fun.
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:05.240]   Duncan, I have one final question for you.
[00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:09.040]   This week on Slack, you shared a picture of you as an extra in a movie with Ben Stiller,
[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:11.240]   and you said you were also on One Tree Hill.
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:13.040]   How did you become an extra in movie and TV shows?
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:14.240]   Was this a film school thing?
[00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:15.240]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:19.660]   So, I went to film school at UNC Wilmington, and so Wilmington had tons of productions
[00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:22.900]   filming there at the time, and so it was just like a part-time job.
[00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:29.540]   You just, like, you put in your headshot and stuff at a casting agency, and then anytime
[00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:34.700]   they just need extras, they call you up, and it, you know, it paid, oh, God.
[00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:35.700]   It paid pretty well.
[00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:39.140]   It was like, you know, you got, like, a hundred bucks a day just for, like, coming and standing
[00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:40.140]   around in the background.
[00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:41.140]   This one was a little more.
[00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:43.540]   I'm going to need to see this headshot at some point, you know.
[00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:44.540]   Oh, God.
[00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:45.540]   I'm sorry.
[00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:46.540]   I think they literally, they took them all, like, on campus.
[00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:47.540]   They just, like, they had, like, a booth, you know, and you, like, walked in.
[00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:48.540]   Oh, okay.
[00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:52.660]   So, you didn't get, like, a professional headshot with, like, a jacket slung over your shoulder
[00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:53.660]   or something like that?
[00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:54.660]   No, no.
[00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:55.660]   I never did that.
[00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:56.660]   No, I didn't really want to be an actor.
[00:30:56.660 --> 00:30:57.660]   Yeah.
[00:30:57.660 --> 00:30:58.660]   All right.
[00:30:58.660 --> 00:30:59.660]   All right.
[00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:00.660]   Ben, thank you for your help, as always.
[00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:01.660]   Thank you, Ben.
[00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:02.660]   Duncan, appreciate it.
[00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:03.660]   Remember, askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:05.500]   Keep those questions and comments coming.
[00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:08.220]   Any other questions on bear markets for next week, we'd love to hear them.
[00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:23.620]   Again, askthecompoundshow@gmail.com, and we will talk to you next time.
[00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:25.620]   Bye.
[00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:26.620]   Bye.
[00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:26.620]   Bye.
[00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:28.940]   (upbeat music)
