[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:09.920]   Now our next talk must be the most important one
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.320]   because we have dedicated the most time
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.880]   for this talk of any of the others.
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.440]   Most of the presentations today are 20 to 25 minutes.
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.180]   This one's a full 30, so it must be really good.
[00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.920]   Dana Ansbach is the founder and CEO of Sensible Money.
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.040]   She has been named to the top 100 most influential
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.480]   financial advisor list by Investopedia
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.920]   for her contributions to financial literacy.
[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.360]   She's been writing on retirement related topics since 2008,
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.140]   including contributions to Market Watch,
[00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.920]   US News and World Report.
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.480]   She's the author of the lecture series,
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.540]   How to Plan for the Perfect Retirement,
[00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.360]   and the author of the books, Control Your Retirement Destiny
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.520]   and Social Security Sense, available on Amazon.
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.560]   She's been practicing as a financial planner since 1995
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.320]   and really has focused on people in their 50s and 60s
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.800]   when she realized that they needed
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.280]   a different type of planning than those of us
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.640]   who are not quite that experienced at life.
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.800]   And so I present to you, Dana Ansbach.
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.040]   - I am not here to tell you the best way
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.240]   to structure your retirement portfolio.
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.700]   There's about as many different ways
[00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.400]   to structure retirement portfolios
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.760]   as there are people in this room.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.640]   And a lot of debate about it.
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.720]   And we're gonna hear some of that debate later today,
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.980]   which I am excited to hear.
[00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.080]   What I am here to tell you
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.720]   is that when you get to the decumulation phase,
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.720]   that point in time where you have to live off your acorns,
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.280]   it's a different game.
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.760]   The best analogy I've heard is it's like you go out
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.920]   and you play your first nine holes of golf.
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.640]   You go in, you have lunch, come out of the clubhouse,
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.080]   you go back out, and instead of golf,
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.320]   you're on a hockey rink.
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.960]   Different risks that you're exposed to in retirement.
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.400]   And so, there are ways that you can structure
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.480]   your retirement portfolio and your planning
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.220]   to help mitigate those risks
[00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.620]   if you decide that that's important to you.
[00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.520]   I wanna start off and ask what are the biggest,
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.040]   what factors have the biggest impact
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.600]   on your retirement outcomes?
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.920]   There's a lot of debate about this also.
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.880]   Is it the date you retire?
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.440]   Is it inflation?
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.480]   Is it how much you've saved?
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.400]   Is it your withdrawal rate?
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.560]   Is it the actual investment or portfolio returns?
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.360]   Well, in order to answer that question,
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.320]   I think you have to take a step back even further
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.780]   and say, well, how do you define outcomes?
[00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.700]   Is it being able to retire when you want?
[00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.200]   Is it being able to have the income or lifestyle
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.240]   that you want in retirement?
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.880]   Is it being able to have the security of knowing
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.800]   that that income will be there as long as you live?
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.040]   Is it being able to know that should you need
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.360]   long-term care or nursing home care later
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.720]   that you have enough assets remaining to cover those costs?
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:03.220]   There's a lot of different ways that we define outcomes.
[00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.420]   And what I would love to see more of in our industry
[00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.640]   and in our discussions around these things
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.040]   is clarity around what's the advice we're talking to
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.760]   in relation to the desired outcome?
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.360]   So, there's a lot of debate about specific advice,
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.520]   but not necessarily tying it to saying,
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.480]   but if your desired outcome was this,
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.880]   that would be the right advice.
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.560]   And if your desired outcome was that,
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.480]   then that would be a lot of the best advice.
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.160]   So, we see a lot of good things out there
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.600]   and all of them may be right
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.680]   depending on what the desired outcome is.
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.840]   When we look at the traditional way of defining outcomes
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.320]   for retirement portfolios,
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.400]   it's using this efficient frontier.
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.040]   And along the horizontal axis, you have risk,
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.200]   and along the vertical axis, you have potential returns.
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.320]   And as you start to add stocks to the portfolio,
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.960]   over the past, we can see that our returns have been higher.
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.280]   The numbers you're seeing at the bottom of the slide
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.920]   come from Dimensional Funds' matrix book.
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.460]   And it's a 37-year time horizon,
[00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.440]   where they're saying if you had 100% stock portfolio,
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.800]   you would have averaged close to 11%.
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.400]   That is gross of fees,
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.440]   so there have been no investment fees
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.120]   netted out of those numbers.
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.960]   And they measure risk by one-year downside.
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.480]   So, at the red at the bottom,
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.440]   you can see what is the worst one-year return
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.120]   you would have experienced.
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.520]   Well, if your outcome was to maximize returns
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.800]   over a long period of time,
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.120]   you might say 100% stock portfolio is the way to go.
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.800]   But if your outcome was, well,
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.320]   I don't know when I might need to use the funds
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.440]   and I wanna have the least risk possible,
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.040]   you might say, well, 100% bonds is the way to go.
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.140]   It really depends on what is your primary outcome.
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.840]   The traditional way of constructing portfolios
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.320]   maps different portfolios on the sufficient frontier
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.240]   and says, well, how do I reduce risk
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.160]   as measured by usually short-term volatility,
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.400]   a quarter or an annual basis?
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.000]   How do I measure risk
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.400]   and what portfolio maximizes potential return
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.620]   for the least amount of volatility?
[00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:12.440]   But as we get into decumulation, it changes.
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.400]   So, here on the left, you see accumulator A,
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.480]   and they have a half a million dollars,
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.760]   and we're gonna follow the arrows up.
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.600]   Their portfolio goes up 20%.
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.540]   They have $600,000 at the end of the year.
[00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:29.240]   The next year, the portfolio goes down 20%,
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.280]   and they have 480,000.
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.520]   Same left-hand graph, accumulator A,
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.000]   looking at the bottom arrows.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.480]   Those returns happen in exactly the opposite order.
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.040]   So, they start with half a million.
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.120]   The portfolio goes down 20%.
[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.560]   They have 400,000.
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.120]   It goes back up 20%, and they have 480.
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.680]   So, they end up in the same place.
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.600]   But on the right, we have decumulator.
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.680]   Now, they have retired,
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.160]   and they know they need to withdraw $50,000
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.680]   to support whatever their expenses are
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.160]   in that year of retirement.
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.440]   Maybe it's a delayed Social Security strategy,
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.960]   so they're gonna take 50,000 out of their portfolio
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.700]   this year, but they may be taking less
[00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.560]   out of their portfolio in later years.
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:13.840]   So, they have half a million.
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.000]   Portfolio goes up to 600,000.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.280]   They take 50 out.
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.400]   They have 550 left.
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.120]   It goes down 20%, and they have 440.
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.340]   But if those returns happen in the opposite order,
[00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:26.600]   their half a million goes down to 400.
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:27.600]   They take out the 50.
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.000]   They have 350 left.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.160]   It goes back up, and they have 420.
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:37.160]   And if you compounded that poor sequence of returns,
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.980]   that undesirable sequence of returns over time,
[00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:42.820]   even though the investments
[00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:46.020]   had the identical rate of return,
[00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:47.540]   you could end up with a scenario
[00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.560]   where the person has substantially less money left,
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.720]   or even runs out of money a lot sooner.
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.140]   Now, in the investment world,
[00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:58.780]   this debate often turns into the way we frame returns.
[00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:00.460]   So, most mutual funds use something
[00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:02.520]   called a time-weighted rate of return
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.820]   in the way that they are publishing
[00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:06.140]   their portfolio returns,
[00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:07.580]   which is the only way they can do it,
[00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:09.300]   because they don't know the exact time
[00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:12.180]   that you made deposits and took withdrawals.
[00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:13.860]   But internal rate of return
[00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:16.240]   will calculate your actual return
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:18.780]   based on the timing of your withdrawals.
[00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:20.660]   And so, when you're comparing returns
[00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:22.540]   against published indexes,
[00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:24.940]   it often doesn't work the way you think.
[00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:27.380]   And returns are not the biggest factor
[00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:30.000]   that's gonna determine your success in retirement.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.100]   The paper I really love on this topic is by Jim Sandage.
[00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:38.380]   This is available on the Social Science Research Network.
[00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:40.940]   It's called "Chaos and Retirement Income."
[00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:42.660]   And this is a graph he has in it
[00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:46.980]   where the orange bars represent 100% stock portfolio.
[00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:51.840]   This is from 2000 to 2015, so we're looking at 15 years.
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:54.840]   There's a 5% initial withdrawal rate,
[00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:58.460]   and that withdrawal rate's going up by 3% a year.
[00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:00.460]   Well, that 100% stock portfolio
[00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:04.660]   has an average return, no fees, of 6.1% a year.
[00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:05.900]   And it runs out of money.
[00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:10.100]   He contrasted that with a 100% fixed income portfolio
[00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:12.020]   that had a 1.5% annual fee
[00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:15.300]   and earned 4.8% as an average return.
[00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:16.660]   And after the 15 years,
[00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:19.900]   while it also declined in value fairly substantially,
[00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:22.860]   there was still principal left.
[00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:25.700]   And the point he makes is that the solutions
[00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:28.620]   that work for retirement income,
[00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:30.600]   did my mic just go out?
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:33.100]   Okay, sounded a little different over there.
[00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:36.380]   The solutions that work for retirement income
[00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:38.580]   are not the same solutions that work
[00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:40.700]   when you're in the accumulation phase.
[00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:42.980]   He even says that using some of the same tools
[00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:46.340]   that you use in accumulation might be dangerous.
[00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:50.740]   So if using the same tools doesn't work,
[00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:54.060]   what are the factors that he says are most important?
[00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:56.780]   Well, he makes the case that beating the index
[00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:59.100]   or beating the market in a negative return
[00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:01.180]   is the most important factor.
[00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:03.420]   Now, I don't know if that is the only
[00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:05.860]   or singular most important factor,
[00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:07.980]   but I think it's an interesting perspective.
[00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.500]   And when you look at the research,
[00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:11.740]   there are portfolio designs
[00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:16.220]   that can help minimize the impact of a worst case scenario.
[00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:19.820]   So when you look at all of this
[00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:21.980]   and you shift to what would be
[00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:25.180]   the retirement income efficient frontier,
[00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:27.020]   across the horizontal axis,
[00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:28.740]   you would have annual consumption.
[00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:30.140]   And across the vertical axis,
[00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:34.220]   you would have average remaining assets to pass along.
[00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:35.860]   If you wanted to maximize your income,
[00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:37.660]   of course, you're gonna reduce the odds
[00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:39.060]   that you're gonna pass along as much
[00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:42.140]   or have as much left later in life.
[00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:43.980]   Now, this is my simplified version
[00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:46.340]   of a retirement efficient frontier,
[00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:48.540]   but there are many versions out there.
[00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:50.660]   This one is from Wade Pfau.
[00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:55.220]   It's from a paper on the Retirement Income Institute.
[00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:58.620]   And on the vertical axis, he has average remaining assets.
[00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:00.300]   And on the horizontal axis,
[00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:03.900]   he's framing it in terms of the percentage chance
[00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:08.900]   that you would not meet your desired level of spending.
[00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:11.900]   Now, the blue line shows a portfolio
[00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:14.260]   that's only stocks and bonds.
[00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.860]   And the black line shows a portfolio
[00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:20.540]   where you have added fixed income annuities.
[00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:22.340]   And the point he's trying to make here
[00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:25.060]   is that by adding another asset class,
[00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:27.140]   fixed income annuities in this case,
[00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:30.540]   you can actually reduce the odds
[00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:33.740]   that you're not going to meet your desired level of spending
[00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:36.940]   and increase the average amount of assets
[00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:40.020]   that you are likely to leave to heirs.
[00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:42.300]   Now, again, I'm not showing this slide to say,
[00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:45.020]   "Oh, you should all run out and add income annuities."
[00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:48.860]   I am illustrating that there are portfolio designs
[00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:51.220]   that can hedge different risks.
[00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:53.780]   And in this case, the risk to hedge
[00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:56.860]   is the risk that you may outlive your money
[00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:58.620]   or the risk that you may not meet
[00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:01.860]   your desired level of spending over time.
[00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:03.980]   And so you can consider these strategies
[00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:05.620]   in light of the goal.
[00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:08.580]   If that's a concern or a goal of yours,
[00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:10.180]   a portion of your portfolio
[00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:14.060]   can be allocated to help hedge that goal.
[00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:16.220]   Now, some additional research by Wade Pfau,
[00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:19.340]   which I did email and dialogue with him before,
[00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:22.420]   because this is an article he wrote in 2017.
[00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:23.980]   It's a three-part series article,
[00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:27.100]   and I wanted to make sure that he still stood by this research.
[00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:29.740]   You know, "Has anything changed, and is it okay if I use it?"
[00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:32.220]   Because I'm not a researcher. I'm a practitioner.
[00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:34.340]   What I do is take this research and figure out,
[00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:36.620]   "How do I actually apply it in the real world?"
[00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:39.620]   So I do rely on a lot of our speakers here
[00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:40.660]   and the research they do,
[00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:43.460]   and it's greatly, greatly appreciated.
[00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:47.700]   So in this article, he talks about time segmentation
[00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:50.180]   or something called rolling bond ladders.
[00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:52.260]   I like to refer to them as rolling income ladders
[00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.380]   because you wouldn't have to fulfill
[00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:56.740]   the bond piece of your portfolio with bonds.
[00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:59.500]   You could use CDs. You could use fixed annuities.
[00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:01.020]   There's other ways to fulfill it.
[00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:03.980]   Think of it as a rolling income ladder.
[00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:08.820]   Now, he compares a traditional, basically 60% stock --
[00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:15.460]   it's 60.8 in this article, 39.2% fixed income allocation --
[00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:17.220]   that you would rebalance automatically
[00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:20.180]   every year to that allocation.
[00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:24.580]   And he wants to compare that against using bond ladder strategies.
[00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:27.980]   And in this case, it was a 10-year bond ladder.
[00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:32.900]   And so at the very bottom, the lighter gray color
[00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:35.460]   reframed automatic rolling ladders.
[00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:38.620]   Well, let's say you started off with a 10-year bond ladder.
[00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:39.940]   I'm going to use a simple analogy.
[00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:41.500]   Let's say I have a million dollars.
[00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:44.700]   I know I need to take $50,000 a year out,
[00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:47.860]   and so I want a bond ladder in place
[00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:50.460]   to cover the first 10 years of my withdrawals.
[00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:52.340]   So I'd have a bond or a CD maturing
[00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:55.740]   in the amount of $50,000 a year every year for 10 years.
[00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:58.300]   That would take up about half a million of my portfolio.
[00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:01.060]   The other half a million would be invested in growth,
[00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:03.180]   some form of growth portfolio.
[00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:05.220]   Well, an automatic rolling ladder would mean
[00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:07.620]   now I'm in year nine of retirement.
[00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:09.420]   I spent my $50,000,
[00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:11.420]   and I would sell some of my stock portfolio
[00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:13.980]   and buy a bond that matures 10 years out.
[00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:16.140]   So I would keep rolling my ladder forward.
[00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:19.420]   So I always had a 10-year runway ahead of me.
[00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:22.220]   Now, the rebalancing with a bond ladder
[00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:24.580]   or rolling ladder approach only goes one way.
[00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:27.660]   You're only rebalancing from stocks to bonds
[00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:31.060]   versus a traditional rebalancing process.
[00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:33.060]   You know, you could rebalance either direction
[00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:34.900]   to a static allocation.
[00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:37.540]   Well, that automatic rolling ladder
[00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:39.740]   was the very worst performing of the two,
[00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:41.700]   and he also wanted to see,
[00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:45.220]   is there anything magic about the actual bond ladder?
[00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:48.820]   Or if I just rebalanced my portfolio
[00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:52.260]   to the same allocation
[00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:56.140]   that would have resulted if I did the bond ladder,
[00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:58.460]   what difference does that make?
[00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:01.220]   And so with the automatic rolling bond ladder,
[00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:04.660]   it performed worse than if you just rebalanced.
[00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:05.620]   And that makes sense
[00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:08.100]   because we're forcing to sell stocks, right?
[00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:10.100]   We're only going from stocks to bonds,
[00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:12.100]   even at times where normally
[00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:14.740]   you would be rebalancing the other way.
[00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:18.460]   So then you get into the teal, the next color up,
[00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:20.220]   and it was a market-based rolling ladder,
[00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:23.860]   meaning I would only extend from stocks to bonds
[00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:26.540]   if the portfolio had a positive return
[00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:29.940]   or had exceeded a certain threshold amount.
[00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:33.100]   And so the market-based portfolio, you know,
[00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:36.980]   did better than the equivalent matching total return.
[00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:40.500]   A little bit better, not substantially better.
[00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:43.660]   Then we get into the set of dashed gray lines
[00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:45.180]   that's just under the yellow,
[00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:47.340]   and that was your traditional 60/40,
[00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:49.580]   and it did pretty good, right?
[00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:53.060]   Just rebalance every year, 60/40.
[00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:54.460]   You know, that's not bad,
[00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:56.860]   especially when you look at the 30-year mark.
[00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:58.780]   That strategy works pretty well.
[00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:02.460]   And if you're a do-it-yourselfer, it's easy to implement,
[00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:04.700]   and over time, it's pretty effective.
[00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:07.980]   So that's pretty nice to see in this research.
[00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:10.740]   And then you have the personalized rolling ladders,
[00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:14.220]   which says I'm gonna build this income ladder
[00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:17.660]   and benchmark it against my personal glide path,
[00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:19.980]   and I'll show you what that looks like in a minute,
[00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:22.020]   but it's basically measuring every year
[00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:24.020]   how much do you have to have remaining
[00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:26.940]   to know that your portfolio will last for life,
[00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:29.380]   and there's a personal calculation.
[00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:31.300]   And a personalized rolling ladder says,
[00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:33.740]   well, you're gonna extend that every year
[00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:35.620]   based on your personal plan.
[00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:36.900]   There's no automatic.
[00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:39.140]   It's not necessarily based on what the market's doing.
[00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:41.740]   If you're ahead of your personal benchmark,
[00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:43.620]   you extend your ladder.
[00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:47.380]   And that had the highest probability of success,
[00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:50.900]   especially as you get out into longer time frames.
[00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:54.900]   But Wade wanted to know why.
[00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:58.220]   So if I just rebalanced to that same allocation,
[00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:00.860]   and what actually happens in this personalized ladder
[00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:03.100]   is if you had a poor series of returns,
[00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:05.820]   you actually end up with a slightly higher stock allocation
[00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:07.460]   as you go forward.
[00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:09.260]   And so if you had just rebalanced
[00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.500]   to those same allocations,
[00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:13.540]   you would have had the same result.
[00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:15.060]   So there's nothing magic
[00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:18.380]   about actually having the bond ladder in place.
[00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:21.740]   There's a lot of behavioral aspects that are talked about,
[00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:23.300]   which I personally agree with.
[00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:24.660]   I think behaviorally,
[00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:26.620]   it's very easy for people to understand
[00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:28.660]   what we call a paycheck replacement portion
[00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:31.260]   of their portfolio versus a growth portfolio.
[00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:32.700]   It makes it much easier for them
[00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:34.380]   to stick with their portfolios.
[00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:36.660]   But he does make the case in the article,
[00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:38.460]   without that bond ladder
[00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:40.820]   or planning process that goes with it,
[00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:44.860]   it would be really hard to have known what to rebalance to,
[00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:47.140]   because it wasn't a static allocation.
[00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:49.900]   It was an allocation that was specifically driven
[00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:53.620]   from a personal benchmark and a personal plan.
[00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:55.980]   And so again, I use this just to illustrate
[00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:58.060]   that there are certain portfolio strategies
[00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:00.780]   when it comes to the decumulation phase
[00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:05.860]   that can increase your probability of success.
[00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:08.420]   So when I think of the keys to great outcomes,
[00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:10.980]   it's planning,
[00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:14.340]   and then it's aligning your portfolio methodology
[00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:16.540]   to that specific plan.
[00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:17.940]   Now, when I talk about planning,
[00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:21.140]   this is an example of planning out cashflow by account.
[00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:23.780]   In this scenario, in section A,
[00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:26.780]   you see Social Security income beginning in two years
[00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:29.420]   because the oldest spouse is currently 68,
[00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:31.020]   and they're waiting until 70
[00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:33.740]   for them to start Social Security.
[00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:35.500]   And you see that Social Security go up
[00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:38.100]   because when the other spouse later claims,
[00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:40.020]   it takes several years.
[00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:43.300]   There's about a six-year age difference between the two.
[00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:44.460]   Then you see section B,
[00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:48.660]   which are withdrawals by account type.
[00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:50.340]   You see the total at the top.
[00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:53.420]   They have about $2.6 million in assets.
[00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:54.740]   And we'll talk a little bit more
[00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:58.220]   about how those withdrawals by account type were derived.
[00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:00.020]   Section C, unspent withdrawals.
[00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:02.220]   Well, when you use software to project this,
[00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:05.340]   if I took $100 out of the IRA
[00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:08.180]   more than I actually needed to consume that year,
[00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:10.340]   the software has to do something with that $100.
[00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:11.900]   So column C is just a catch-all.
[00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:13.940]   It's if I actually withdrew a little bit more money
[00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:16.260]   than I needed from a tax-deferred account,
[00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.340]   it's got to put that money somewhere.
[00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:19.180]   And D says, well,
[00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:21.460]   here's our total cashflow available to retirement.
[00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:24.020]   Notice that it's going up over time.
[00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:26.100]   That's because of inflation.
[00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:28.460]   So when I talk about thorough planning,
[00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:32.140]   you have to customize the assumptions to you.
[00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:35.580]   And so here we carried section D over,
[00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:37.540]   and we're going to outline where it's going.
[00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:39.980]   We've got housing expenses, no mortgage,
[00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:42.340]   so that's just property taxes and insurance.
[00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:45.220]   Living expenses are inflating at 3%,
[00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:49.060]   but they're slowing down to an inflation rate of 2%,
[00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:51.180]   about a decade into the plan.
[00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:54.320]   Because when we look at actual retiree spending habits,
[00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:56.540]   there are the go-go years, the slow-go years,
[00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:58.380]   and then what are referred to as the no-go years.
[00:18:58.380 --> 00:18:59.900]   And spending does slow down.
[00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:02.260]   And you can reflect that in the types of assumptions
[00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:03.460]   that you use.
[00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:06.180]   Medical expenses are using a 5% inflation rate,
[00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:09.140]   and we also have a specific column for big-ticket items,
[00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:11.700]   which is referring to auto purchases.
[00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:13.980]   And we find that the frequency of auto purchases
[00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:18.120]   slows down as people enter their later retirement years,
[00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:20.060]   but we do need to account for that.
[00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:23.780]   And then you'll see their monthly after-tax,
[00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:27.100]   after-big-ticket is what most people want to know.
[00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:29.060]   You know, what do I have to spend each month?
[00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:32.820]   You know, after-car purchases and after taxes are paid.
[00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:36.780]   And that is going up based on the customized inflation
[00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:37.500]   assumptions.
[00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:40.900]   And then over on the right, if the portfolio averages a 5%
[00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:42.620]   return throughout retirement, it's
[00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:45.860]   charting out what are the average remaining assets,
[00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:47.980]   or what are the expected remaining assets
[00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:50.740]   after all of the withdrawals have been taken.
[00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:54.060]   Well, if you've done this kind of planning,
[00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:58.180]   then you can customize your portfolio methodology
[00:19:58.180 --> 00:20:00.100]   to your plan.
[00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:02.260]   So when we look at these specific withdrawals,
[00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:05.540]   I'm going to spend down that non-retirement account first.
[00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:07.620]   And in the background, there's Roth conversions
[00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:09.180]   happening in the first three years.
[00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:12.700]   Wade's going to talk about that in a few sessions.
[00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:16.060]   But if you've tax-optimized the withdrawals, and you've said,
[00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:18.180]   well, here's the most tax-efficient way for me
[00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:22.220]   to withdraw, then the withdrawal pattern
[00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:25.940]   can help dictate the allocation of that specific account.
[00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:27.780]   And what I still see a lot of people
[00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:31.140]   that will have each account balanced 60/40, for example,
[00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:32.460]   or 70/30.
[00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:35.580]   But in this case, if I'm never going to touch Sam's Roth,
[00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:38.540]   I'd probably have it 100% invested in equity.
[00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:40.900]   And if I'm going to use all of my non-retirement account
[00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:42.740]   in the first seven years, I'm probably
[00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:45.220]   going to ladder it into CDs or Treasury bills
[00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:47.260]   and have none of it in equities.
[00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:49.740]   And then the two IRA accounts are likely going to be
[00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:52.020]   a little bit more balanced.
[00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:54.420]   But having that personalized plan
[00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:57.980]   allows you to, as I describe it, create a job description
[00:20:57.980 --> 00:20:59.340]   for each account.
[00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:02.300]   And then you're matching the allocation design
[00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:06.140]   of that account to its specific job description,
[00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:08.100]   defined as what are the cash flows it
[00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:10.140]   needs to produce for you.
[00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:13.140]   Now, if I wanted to add an income annuity in,
[00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:16.860]   then I might look at Sally's IRA and say, wow,
[00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:20.420]   I take out on a minimum $30,000 a year.
[00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:23.260]   So maybe if I were going to place an income annuity
[00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:27.060]   into this portfolio, I would do it within Sally's IRA
[00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:30.620]   because I'm not changing the tax consequences of the portfolio.
[00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:33.940]   I've already optimized my withdrawals based on that.
[00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:37.340]   So I might run out and say, well, how much of Sally's IRA
[00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:41.180]   would it take if I wanted to generate a guaranteed $30,000
[00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:45.340]   a year and add that into my retirement portfolio?
[00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:48.460]   If I wanted to use an income ladder, a personalized income
[00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:50.820]   ladder, this would lay out the cash flows
[00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:53.540]   that I would need to build in each account
[00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:58.740]   and help me decide how much should be allocated to that.
[00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:01.780]   So a little more deep dive on the income ladder,
[00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:03.700]   which I am a fan of.
[00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:06.300]   I am a little biased when it comes to that.
[00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:11.300]   But that's because I don't have the luxury of saying, well,
[00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:13.400]   I'll just do it any other way.
[00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:16.380]   When you're running a firm and have a fiduciary responsibility,
[00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:18.300]   you look at, well, I need this money
[00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:19.980]   to last for the rest of someone's life.
[00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:22.460]   And if I'm responsible, I want to do it
[00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:26.020]   in a way that gives them the highest probability of success,
[00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:29.780]   at least based on what the research shows today.
[00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:31.520]   So you think of your income ladder
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:35.220]   as predictable cash flow paired with a growth bucket.
[00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:37.580]   And there has to be a process to say, well,
[00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:39.100]   when that growth bucket is--
[00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:41.700]   I like to think of it as overflowing,
[00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:44.900]   then when do I refill my income ladder?
[00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:49.700]   And Wade talked about some of the different ways to do that.
[00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:52.260]   One of them was his personalized rolling ladder.
[00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:55.220]   And that is based on the work of asset dedication, which
[00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:57.260]   he references in his article.
[00:22:57.260 --> 00:23:02.380]   This is a personalized plan where the dashed white lines
[00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:04.760]   represent what's called the critical path, the minimum
[00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:06.940]   amount of assets this person needs
[00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:09.980]   to have remaining for their plan to work for life.
[00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:11.780]   Now, it might not be the desired plan,
[00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:13.460]   although some people do come in and say,
[00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:15.600]   I want to die with a dollar in the bank.
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:18.300]   How can you make it so my last check bounces?
[00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:20.220]   I'm like, well, it's a little hard to do
[00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:24.020]   because I don't know how long you're going to live.
[00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:25.680]   But most people don't really want that.
[00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:28.140]   They do want some assets remaining.
[00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:30.580]   But the yellow line tracks their actual portfolio
[00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:31.820]   against that path.
[00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:35.020]   And when the yellow line is ahead of the dashed white line,
[00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:37.740]   then you would extend your income ladder.
[00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:39.540]   Now, Wade, in our dialogue, said he's
[00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:41.220]   been playing around with a simpler way
[00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:43.460]   to do this, where you could just track it
[00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:45.500]   against your starting value.
[00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:48.460]   So whenever your portfolio exceeded your starting
[00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:52.460]   portfolio value, you would extend the income ladder.
[00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:54.020]   And so this would be a way you could
[00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:56.720]   implement that kind of strategy on your own.
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:24:00.540]   And I'm hopeful he'll come out with that research pretty soon
[00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:04.820]   and show us how it looks.
[00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:07.700]   So we've talked about the fixed income side,
[00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:10.500]   adding income annuities or bond ladders.
[00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:12.900]   But what about the equity side?
[00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:17.100]   Well, traditionally, we use something like the economy car
[00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:19.560]   on the bottom, which is a risk-adjusted return
[00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:22.780]   portfolio built on the efficient frontier.
[00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:24.380]   Probably gets good gas mileage.
[00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:25.540]   It's going to get us around.
[00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:28.820]   It can hold a reasonable number of people.
[00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:30.980]   Or we could go for the sports car.
[00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:32.900]   Like, who cares about speeding tickets?
[00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:34.620]   I just want to go, right?
[00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:37.100]   We're going to maximize returns.
[00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:40.900]   Or we don't hear this talked about as often,
[00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:44.980]   but what would an all-weather portfolio look like?
[00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:47.820]   And so we could design a portfolio
[00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:53.900]   to maximize the minimum gain or to maximize the outcome
[00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:55.500]   in a worst-case scenario.
[00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:59.500]   Meaning if I got a worst-case decade in equities,
[00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:02.420]   what would have held up the best?
[00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:03.860]   Am I at time?
[00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:04.820]   Five minutes, perfect.
[00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:07.260]   I can get through the rest.
[00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:10.640]   So I'm using the research of asset dedication
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:14.100]   from an article published in the Journal of Financial Planning.
[00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:16.380]   And here they compare four strategies.
[00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:18.700]   These are just equity strategies.
[00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:20.700]   So looking at, you've already decided
[00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:23.460]   if you wanted to add income annuities or bond ladders.
[00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:25.540]   And now you're looking at, is there a different way
[00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:28.140]   to design my equity portfolio?
[00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:30.660]   S&P 500 is the benchmark.
[00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:32.820]   The red is our sports car.
[00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:34.060]   We're just going for it, right?
[00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:35.860]   We're going to maximize returns.
[00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:38.780]   The blue is our economy car.
[00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:40.820]   We're going to look at risk-adjusted returns.
[00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:43.600]   And four is what's referred to as mini-max, which
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:46.720]   is a concept that comes out of gaming theory and says, well,
[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:48.280]   how do I design a portfolio that's
[00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:50.840]   going to hold up the best in a worst-case scenario?
[00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:56.880]   For those who want all of the deep dive research,
[00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:58.920]   they use 16 different categories.
[00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:03.760]   They pulled all the return data from the Kenneth French Data
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:04.880]   Library.
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:06.240]   We'll pass right over that.
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:08.720]   So here's our results.
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:13.680]   So we have our S&P. And in a worst-case scenario,
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:16.880]   there was 40 different time horizons studied.
[00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:22.120]   It took 15 years to get back to zero.
[00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:25.860]   Our dashed lines show our average return.
[00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:29.040]   And so we see, as we know, the average return for the S&P
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:32.240]   is about 10%.
[00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:35.920]   And the average would study all of the rolling one-year time
[00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:38.240]   frames or all of the rolling five-year time
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:42.680]   frames in those 40 years studied.
[00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:48.120]   Next, we add in maximizing expected return.
[00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:51.400]   Now, I can't remember what the allocation of this portfolio
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:54.880]   was, but it might have been like 100% small cap value.
[00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:58.840]   So it would have been something like a one-asset class
[00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:01.160]   portfolio.
[00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:07.160]   Now, again, it took 15 years for our worst case to get above zero.
[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:11.320]   15 years is a long time if you're in retirement.
[00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:14.920]   But our average return is now much higher.
[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:17.520]   And so if I'm more than 15 years away from retirement
[00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:19.120]   and I said, well, that's my goal,
[00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:21.360]   that might not be a bad strategy.
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:24.560]   I myself am still 100% equity.
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:26.400]   I'm 52 years old.
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:29.320]   I think the first year I would even conceive of retirement
[00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:32.600]   would be 65, although likely for me it's 70.
[00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:35.080]   But what I will do when I'm 55 is
[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:38.000]   I will sell enough of my equity portfolio
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.120]   and I will be buying a bond that matures
[00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:43.440]   when I turn 65 for whatever amount
[00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:45.040]   I think I might need to withdraw.
[00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:47.880]   And so I will slowly build out my bond ladder
[00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:50.080]   by the time I get to 65.
[00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:55.720]   Next, we have the maximized Sharpe ratio.
[00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:58.320]   This is our economy car.
[00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:01.080]   And so here, again, it was 15 years
[00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:05.800]   before our worst case scenario rose above zero.
[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:08.720]   But our average return when we got out to about 10,
[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:11.000]   really about 15 years--
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.240]   actually, our average return the whole time
[00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:21.000]   was higher than just the S&P or just our other scenarios.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.680]   And last, we have our minimax.
[00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:27.680]   And so now our worst case scenario
[00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:31.800]   got us back to break even in six years.
[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:34.520]   So half the time, which again, if you're retired,
[00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:37.320]   that's a really big difference.
[00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:40.480]   The trade-off, though, is the average return
[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:45.080]   is substantially lower than most of the other strategies.
[00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:47.760]   And so there is a trade-off in retirement
[00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:49.760]   if you want to build your portfolio
[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:52.560]   to hedge against downside risk.
[00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:53.680]   There is no free lunch.
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:55.400]   We talk about that all the time.
[00:28:55.400 --> 00:29:00.200]   But there are strategies that can help hedge different risks.
[00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:03.000]   Wrapping up, I think it's really important
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.240]   to decide what the goal is.
[00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:08.600]   If you're still using a portfolio that's
[00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:10.640]   going to maximize average returns,
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:13.080]   you need to understand that in a worst case scenario,
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:17.240]   that portfolio may not hold up as well.
[00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:20.440]   Use planning and portfolio strategies
[00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:22.560]   designed to help you achieve your goals,
[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:24.080]   whatever those might be.
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:26.240]   Some people want to spend as much as possible
[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:30.200]   early in retirement and really do are like, my kids are fine.
[00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:32.520]   Other people, they really want to maximize
[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:34.240]   what they're going to pass along to heirs
[00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:37.200]   or do gifting strategies along the way.
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:40.520]   Evaluate income ladders and annuities in their ability
[00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:42.640]   to help you achieve the goal.
[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:46.080]   And evaluate portfolios relative to the goal,
[00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:49.120]   not comparing one to the other.
[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:53.000]   What I still see a lot of, and I mentioned this earlier,
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   is comparing returns of one strategy to another.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.120]   And what I would love to see more of in retirement,
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:03.200]   particularly when we're talking about the decumulation space,
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:04.920]   is thinking of these things in terms
[00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:07.880]   of what goals do they help hedge,
[00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:10.040]   and is that important to me.
[00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:12.640]   And I really think that can help shift the conversation
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:17.240]   and make so much of what we see out there a little more clear,
[00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:18.600]   a little more understandable.
[00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:21.880]   And then we'll be able to put it in its right place
[00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:25.080]   in the framework.
[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:27.080]   Back to you, Jim.
[00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:30.440]   [APPLAUSE]
