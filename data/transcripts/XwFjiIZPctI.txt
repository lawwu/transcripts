[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.480]   We have a trio of episodes recently on Jonathan Edwards in episodes number 554
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:16.000]   and 556 and to finish it out today, Jaden from Gold Coast, Australia writes in,
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   "Hi Pastor John, I was reading Jonathan Edwards sermon, 'The Pure in Heart Blessed'
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.200]   and came across the word 'Excellency.' In context it read, 'Man's true happiness is
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:34.000]   his perfection and true excellency.'" What does Edwards mean when he uses the word
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.500]   excellent or excellency in his writings? It is a very, very common word in Edwards.
[00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.000]   He loves to apply it to God. He loves to apply it to Christ. He sometimes applies
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:54.700]   it to us in our sanctified growth. It's built of course on the term
[00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:05.200]   excel, which means surpass, and refers to that which surpasses other pretenders,
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:11.400]   surpasses them in what, we should ask? Not in sin, of course, not in evil. He's not
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.840]   surpassing, God is not surpassing in evil. He's surpassing, he's exceeding, he's
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:25.420]   excelling in every right way, which raises the question of what definition
[00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:35.980]   of right should we use in God, since God is not measured by anything outside of
[00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:42.940]   God, right? He doesn't conform to a standard of rightness outside of God.
[00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:52.060]   That would be God if he did. God is right because he feels and thinks and acts in
[00:01:52.060 --> 00:02:00.660]   perfect accord with his own infinite self, or his own infinite worth. It is
[00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:06.940]   right to value infinitely what is infinitely valuable, namely God. It is
[00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:12.060]   right to think in perfect accord with infinite knowledge of what is true,
[00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:19.980]   namely God's knowledge. It is right to act perfectly to reflect and display the
[00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:26.980]   fullness of God's person. So God's excellency is his perfect feeling,
[00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:34.100]   thinking, and acting in harmony with himself. He excels all others in this.
[00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:42.540]   God's excellency is his perfectly felt, perfectly thought, perfectly acted,
[00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:50.780]   God-centeredness. And so, to fill it out, God is supremely happy in this way of
[00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:58.380]   feeling and thinking and acting. He's happy in this way of being, and this
[00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:07.220]   infinite happiness is part of his excellency. His excellency includes the
[00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:12.220]   surpassing happiness that he has in feeling, thinking, and acting in perfect
[00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.940]   accord with his infinite worth. And just to complete the picture, this divine
[00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:24.380]   happiness has the tendency to overflow so that God's creation of the world is
[00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:30.060]   the sharing of his happiness in feeling and thinking and acting in accord with
[00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.980]   his infinite worth. In other words, God's creation and redemption is for man's
[00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:43.100]   enjoyment and praise and reflection of this happiness and this excellency. That
[00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:51.980]   is man's excellency. When man joyfully feels and thinks and acts in accord with
[00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:58.820]   the infinite worth of God, this is man's true excellency. If man is supremely
[00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:05.660]   happy in bringing all of his life into accord with what shows God as his
[00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:12.780]   supreme treasure, this is the man's excellency, because it shows God's true
[00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:21.940]   excellency. Now Edwards sometimes uses the word "glory" in place of "excellency," and
[00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:28.140]   sometimes uses the word "beauty" in place of "excellency." For example, he has a
[00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:35.660]   sermon called "Safety, Fullness, and Sweet Refreshment in Christ." And in it he says
[00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:43.420]   this, "The excellency of Christ is an infinite excellency, such a one as the
[00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:51.660]   mind desires, in which it can find no bounds. Every new discovery makes this
[00:04:51.660 --> 00:05:00.260]   beauty appear more ravishing, and the mind sees no end." So he has replaced the
[00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:06.900]   word "excellency" with "beauty," and that tips you off. Beauty is what Edwards means
[00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:15.460]   by excellency. Infinite beauty. And that can then, in sentences, replace excellency.
[00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:20.140]   There's one more sermon that I want to refer to that helps. This is the
[00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:24.020]   essence of the matter, I think, very practically, for the excellency of Christ
[00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.980]   or of God. He preached a sermon one time called, and I recommend it to everybody,
[00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:37.100]   "The Excellency of Christ," based on Revelation 5, 5 through 6, where Christ is
[00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:46.100]   described as the "lion of the tribe of Judah," verse 5, and the "lamb standing as
[00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:52.820]   though it had been slain," next verse, verse 6. And Edwards draws magnificently
[00:05:52.820 --> 00:06:02.260]   out of that juxtaposition. Lion, lamb. Lion, lamb. He draws out of that Christ's true
[00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:11.300]   excellency and beauty consists in the coming together in one person of beauties
[00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:16.580]   that seem contrary to each other. Characteristics of a lamb,
[00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:22.540]   characteristics of a lion that seem contrary to each other but cohere
[00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:28.700]   harmoniously and perfectly in one person. That's his understanding of beauty. Things
[00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:36.100]   that seem to be opposites cohering in beautiful, perfect harmony in oneness. And
[00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:42.620]   here's the quote that I love, "Infinite highness and infinite condescension."
[00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:49.740]   These are descriptions of the contraries that unite in Christ. "Infinite justice
[00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:57.820]   and infinite grace. Infinite glory and lowest humility. Infinite majesty and
[00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:04.660]   transcendent meekness. Deepest reverence towards God and equality with God.
[00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:09.980]   Infinite worthiness of good and the greatest patience under suffering evil.
[00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:16.020]   An exceeding spirit of obedience with supreme dominion over heaven and earth.
[00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:22.380]   Absolute sovereignty and perfect resignation. Self-sufficiency and an
[00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:31.700]   entire trust and reliance on God. That is what he means by the excellency of Christ.
[00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:41.580]   And to the degree that we feel and think and act in ways that show that is our
[00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:48.620]   supreme treasure, that's our excellency. Beautiful. What a profound truth and a
[00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:53.180]   wonderful word. Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you, Jaden, for the question. That
[00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:57.620]   sermon from Jonathan Edwards, "The Excellency of Christ," also appears in
[00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:02.340]   episode number 128 of this podcast, an episode we titled, "How Do I Delight
[00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:07.180]   Myself in the Lord?" You'll want to check out that episode number 128 for more, and
[00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:12.660]   to hear Pastor John read a few more choice excerpts from it. We are gonna
[00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:16.620]   return tomorrow. Until then, I'm your host Tony Ranke. Thanks for listening to the
[00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:19.740]   Ask Pastor John podcast.
