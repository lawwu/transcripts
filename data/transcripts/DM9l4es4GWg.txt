[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.840]   - One anonymous young woman writes in
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:07.840]   with a question today.
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:08.680]   Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.540]   I'm normally a optimistic person and full of life,
[00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.120]   but lately it's been such a struggle
[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.980]   to even want to get out of bed in the mornings.
[00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.600]   I'm a student at BCS, and I'm very grateful
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.800]   for all the lessons God is teaching me here,
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.580]   but I dread going to class.
[00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.720]   This is so discouraging because I moved many miles
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.720]   so that I could come to this school.
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.960]   Deep down, I don't doubt God still wants me here,
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.180]   but I don't think he wants me
[00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.680]   to have this attitude about life.
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.640]   Is this depression?
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.980]   I have almost no motivation for anything.
[00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.960]   I've been praying, and I will keep praying
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.560]   for God to be my strength,
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.640]   but how do you fight when you don't feel like fighting?
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.120]   Each morning brings with it a desire
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.760]   to stay in bed for days so I don't have to face life.
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.160]   I truly hate feeling this way
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.740]   because I feel I've lost my joy in God's will for me.
[00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.160]   I feel oppressed by the powers of the dark world,
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.680]   and I don't see an escape.
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.000]   I really appreciate you answering such hard questions.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   It helps me remember that by no means
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.240]   am I the only warrior in this fight against the devil.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.840]   Oh, how I feel empathy for this
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.840]   because I've tasted these kinds of seasons many times.
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.040]   Don't want to get out of bed,
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.440]   dread doing the things we have to do,
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.020]   no motivation for anything,
[00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.080]   don't feel like fighting the fight,
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.200]   a loss of joy in what we thought God had called us to do,
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.880]   oppressed by what feels like demonic darkness.
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.040]   So that's her situation, and I've tasted it,
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.420]   and so I feel a kind of urgency for her.
[00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.960]   She asks, "Is this depression?"
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.360]   And of course, my answer is, "I don't know."
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.360]   I'm not close enough to the situation.
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.360]   I don't know her well enough,
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.060]   and I would say to you, she didn't give us her name,
[00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.640]   if you have a history of depression,
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.560]   you'll probably know what kind of season this is,
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.480]   but if you don't,
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:12.360]   I certainly wouldn't jump to that conclusion automatically.
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.860]   Depression is not a simple black and white thing.
[00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.860]   There are many degrees of discouragement on a continuum
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.360]   into the most debilitating kind of depression,
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.320]   and you'll certainly want to be alert to that.
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.080]   I would recommend, if this continues,
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.800]   a physical checkup with a doctor
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.360]   just to make sure there's no, for example, mononucleosis
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.680]   or some kind of a nutritional issue.
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.600]   We are body and soul,
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.480]   and our bodies can play tricks on us
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.680]   and wreak havoc with our minds and our spirits.
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.080]   If we were sitting together,
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.080]   I'd probably ask you about sleep habits and exercise habits
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.440]   and eating and so on.
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.960]   There's so many ways that we can be depleted
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.960]   and it feels spiritual when it has physical roots as well.
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:13.160]   So I'm gonna depend on you to know yourself and your history
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.120]   and your physical condition
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.320]   and to get the help you need in that regard,
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.640]   but let me just point to a few wonderful,
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.480]   spiritual, biblical, God-given truths
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.480]   that He means for your help and strength right now.
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.480]   Number one, 1 Corinthians 10, 13, "No testing,"
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.400]   and you probably know as a student with your Greek
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.900]   that the word temptation and testing are the same in Greek,
[00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.360]   "No testing has overtaken you,
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.440]   "but what is common to man, God is faithful.
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.180]   "He will not let you be tested beyond what your ability is,
[00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.180]   "but with the testing, He will provide a way of escape,"
[00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.040]   and then here comes the key phrase,
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.520]   "that you may be able to endure it."
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.640]   So the issue is one of endurance, not just escape.
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.240]   The escape is the capacity to endure,
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.160]   and so know that He's got you in this season of testing
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.160]   and He has got you there not beyond your ability to endure.
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.800]   Number two, when God tests your endurance,
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.280]   He's not doing it because He doesn't love you.
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.760]   This is so plain in Hebrews 12, 6 following
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.040]   that He delights in His children whom He disciplines,
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.880]   delights in them.
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.360]   Isn't that amazing that when He disciplines us,
[00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.880]   He's disciplining the son in whom He delights
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.040]   or the daughter in whom He delights,
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.080]   so don't let the devil convince you
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.640]   that this season of testing is because God is against you.
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:49.840]   That's hellish.
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.380]   That's not from heaven.
[00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.000]   You have heard the endurance of Job
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.080]   and you have seen the purpose of the Lord,
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.080]   how the Lord is compassionate and merciful, James 5, 11.
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.880]   Number three, Psalm 40, first three verses,
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.800]   portrays David mired in the darkness
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.200]   and waiting for the Lord,
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:17.200]   and I just wanna testify that much Christian obedience
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:22.280]   consists in waiting for God to do what we need Him to do
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:27.040]   when the timing seems very slow to us.
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.160]   Number four, God's Word, the Bible,
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.380]   is specifically designed for these seasons of testing.
[00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.360]   For whatever was written, this is amazing,
[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.220]   this is sweeping, this is Romans 15, 4.
[00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:44.000]   Whatever was written in former days
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.320]   was written for our instruction that by the endurance,
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.120]   there's the keyword, the endurance,
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.520]   getting through tough things,
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.240]   the endurance and encouragement of the Scriptures,
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.600]   we might have hope.
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.880]   So if you can, in so much as you can just make it
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.760]   a few verses, be in the Word every day.
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.640]   Even though you don't feel like fighting,
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:10.600]   give yourself that medicine every day.
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:15.520]   Number five, acknowledge that only divine power,
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.400]   and I mean mighty power,
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:23.400]   can sustain you and me through the tests like this.
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.560]   And I mention it because Colossians 1.11
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.080]   has often amazed me.
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.160]   It goes like this,
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:33.680]   "May you be strengthened with all power
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.700]   "according to His glorious might."
[00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.680]   Now, what's all that for?
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:44.640]   For all endurance and patience with joy,
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:49.640]   which says to me that endurance and patience with joy
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:53.100]   requires omnipotent power.
[00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.680]   We think it's a small thing.
[00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.840]   You're not fighting a small battle.
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.340]   This takes omnipotent divine power
[00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:02.220]   to sustain Christians through times of testing.
[00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:06.080]   Number six, remember God knows your frame
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.780]   and that you are just dust.
[00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:13.040]   Psalm 103 is sweet.
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:16.560]   Verse 13, "As a father has compassion on his children,
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.520]   "so the Lord is compassionate to those who fear Him."
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.360]   He knows our frame.
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.440]   He remembers that we are dust.
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:29.560]   Isn't that amazing that God takes into account
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:33.280]   the fragile frame that we have as humans?
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:36.120]   And the last thing I would say, number seven,
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:40.000]   take hold of one or two specific promises.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.600]   Write them on a piece of paper,
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.200]   put them in your pocket to carry through the day
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.680]   or in your purse, and take them out
[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:49.040]   and read them to yourself or memorize it
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.840]   and say it to yourself often.
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:52.360]   Say it over and over again.
[00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:55.360]   Declare your allegiance to Jesus
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.780]   in and through specific promises,
[00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:01.760]   like I thought of these two for you in closing.
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:04.540]   Psalm 139.11,
[00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:08.980]   "If I say, surely the darkness shall cover me
[00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:11.960]   "and the light about me be night,
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:16.460]   "even the darkness is not dark to you.
[00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:19.780]   "The night is bright as the day,
[00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:23.860]   "for darkness is as light with you."
[00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:27.340]   So it feels like darkness to you is not darkness to God.
[00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:28.860]   He's in the bright light
[00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:30.840]   and He knows how to take care of you.
[00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:34.300]   And the last one is Isaiah 43.2,
[00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:37.180]   "When you pass through the waters, I'll be with you,"
[00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:39.500]   God says, "and through the rivers,
[00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:40.960]   "they shall not overwhelm you.
[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:44.640]   "When you walk through fire, you shall not be burned
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.440]   "and the flame shall not consume you,
[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:50.020]   "for I am the Lord your God,
[00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:52.740]   "the Holy One of Israel, your Savior.
[00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:56.300]   "And if so for Israel, how much more for those in Jesus?"
[00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:58.180]   So that's my prayer for you.
[00:08:58.180 --> 00:08:59.540]   God is faithful.
[00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:00.980]   He will do it.
[00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:01.940]   - Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:05.140]   And thank you for sending in this very honest question.
[00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:06.300]   Some of the best questions that we get
[00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:08.560]   are the ones that are really hardest to articulate
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:13.180]   and write and confess in words to others.
[00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:16.620]   And you are not alone in this fight.
[00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:18.540]   Well, we have again hit the weekend
[00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:20.720]   and that means it's time for me to remind you
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:23.300]   and to encourage you to subscribe to our podcast
[00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:26.140]   and find our audio feeds and search our episode archive
[00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:28.200]   and even reach us by email with a difficult question
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.780]   that you might be facing in life.
[00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:31.220]   You can do all of those things
[00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:36.220]   at our online home at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:38.580]   Speaking of resources, as many of you know,
[00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:41.700]   Pastor John has been writing books like crazy
[00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:44.340]   in the past couple of years, which has been great to see.
[00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:47.620]   It's also been a little daunting to know what he's written
[00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:50.020]   and why he wrote them in the first place.
[00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:51.600]   And on Monday, he will walk us through
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.340]   his latest three books, including one
[00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:55.900]   that you may not have heard about
[00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:57.660]   because it hasn't gone to press yet.
[00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:59.460]   It's a new trilogy of books
[00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:01.540]   and he's gonna walk us through each title
[00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:04.180]   and why he wrote each one.
[00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:05.980]   I am really looking forward to it.
[00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:07.340]   I am your host, Tony Reinke.
