[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120]   The first one comes from The Alchemist, who asks, "If one is doing deep work and gets
[00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:14.240]   distracted, does that transmogrify the work into shallow work?"
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:20.360]   Alright, well first of all, I appreciate the Calvin and Hobbes reference with transmogrify,
[00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.720]   from scientific progress goes boink from that collection.
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.760]   Calvin builds the transmogrifier, which can transform you from one creature to another,
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.920]   so there's a good Bill Watterson shout out.
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.880]   This is a good question, it's a technical question, let's do it quick, but I think it's
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.160]   important.
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:43.320]   So in the ontology of knowledge-work focus, we have deep work and shallow work and deep
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.600]   work, you know I wrote the book about it, it's where you're focused without distraction
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.040]   on cognitively demanding work and shallow work.
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.280]   I often just casually define as everything else.
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.040]   So the question is, if you don't meet all of the standards of deep work, is what you're
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.860]   left with shallow work?
[00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.600]   And actually, if we're going to be technical about this, not really.
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.000]   So let me be a little bit more specific here.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.280]   So shallow work is efforts that do not directly move the needle, so it's not the effort that
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.320]   is directly creating the value on which your company or job relies.
[00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.800]   It's important, if you don't do shallow work, your company can't exist, you can't keep your
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.920]   job.
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.640]   But on the other hand, if all you did was shallow work, your company wouldn't exist
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.160]   and you can't keep your job, right?
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:41.000]   So if you're the computer programmer, the actual effort that creates value for your
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.680]   company is code, producing code that becomes a product they can sell.
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.720]   Shallow work, like going to the marketing meetings, etc.
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.480]   You need to do it, you need to understand what's going on, but if all you did was that
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.280]   shallow work, no code got produced, eventually the company goes out of business.
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.120]   Deep work is a little bit more complicated because instead of just being a what, it's
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.580]   also a how.
[00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.440]   So deep work, we have to care about the content.
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.080]   So deep work needs to be focused on something that actually moves the needle, it's cognitively
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.200]   demanding, it produces new value, it's the core activities that matter in your professional
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.200]   life.
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.760]   But the how matters as well.
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.880]   To really qualify as deep work, it has to be executed without distraction, which means
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.660]   you're not context shifting.
[00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.400]   No quick checking of your email, no quick checking of your phone, all you're doing is
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.360]   focusing on that task.
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.060]   You need the how and the what together for it to count as deep work.
[00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.020]   So the way I see this question is what happens if you keep the what, you're focusing on something
[00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.400]   important, you're writing computer code, but you get rid of the how.
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.440]   So instead of doing that without distraction, you're kind of looking at your phone, you
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.520]   have slack going.
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.560]   Well, really what you end up with there is something that's not deep work and it's not
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.960]   shallow work.
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.000]   The activity that you're doing is cognitively demanding and important, but the way you're
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.200]   doing it is not up to the full standard of what your mind is capable of.
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.160]   So I don't actually have a term for that.
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.480]   I mean, it essentially throws you into a productivity purgatory.
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.120]   Maybe we could call it pseudo deep work or failed deep work.
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.120]   And it's not where you want to be.
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.600]   As long as you're working on an activity that's really important, you want to do it in the
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.220]   way that's going to get the most value out of the time you spend, and that is to do it
[00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.840]   without distraction.
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:26.240]   So we really should have three things here, shallow work, deep work, and pseudo deep work.
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.360]   Shallow work is necessary, but not sufficient to be very successful.
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.920]   It's important logistical things, but it's not the stuff that moves the needle.
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.320]   Deep work is it all coming together and you're working on what matters and you're doing it
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.360]   in a way that allows you to do it at a high level.
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.860]   In between is pseudo deep work.
[00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.920]   You're working on something important, but not doing it that well.
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.360]   You're context shifting, so your ability to focus is reduced and the quality of what you
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.320]   produce is downgraded.
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.460]   So I guess we need a new word.
[00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.880]   So let's go with, we'll go with pseudo deep work for now.
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:57.880]   So that's a good clarification.
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:05.680]   Yeah, that's definitely been a complexity that's entered my discussions of deep work
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.320]   is it's the how and the what.
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.640]   And you got to get both of those things for it to really, really to count.
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:18.520]   So in a way, pseudo might be a little bit too positive of an adjective for it because
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:21.880]   it's kind of distracted work, right?
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:22.880]   Yeah.
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.440]   Like so failed deep work, depreciated deep work.
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.440]   Yeah, something like that.
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.440]   Yeah.
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.440]   Degraded deep work.
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.440]   Yeah.
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.440]   You don't really want to be there.
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.440]   Yeah.
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.440]   Why?
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.520]   But I mean, as long as you're spending the time to work on something important, you probably
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.920]   want to get as much as possible out of that time.
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:39.920]   Yeah.
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:40.080]   I'm with you on that.
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.080]   [MUSIC]
