[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.680]   Today, in the United States, we inaugurate our 45th president.
[00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.340]   And politics aside, there's always something majestic about presidential inaugurations
[00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.760]   and royal coronations.
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.600]   They carry with them an unusual weightiness.
[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:22.780]   These rare events transcend time by the regalia of their gravity, something more like a wedding
[00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:27.220]   or a funeral or some combination of the two.
[00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.240]   Inaugurations are events so significant they almost seem to overshadow the person at the
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.760]   center of it all, the people present, and even the generation who witnesses it.
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.440]   In an inauguration, we get a small sense of a nation's weight.
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.040]   The theme of kingdom is a very significant one in scripture.
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.240]   Christ himself is a sovereign king.
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:54.240]   He was coronated in his resurrection and ascension, and he now reigns over a kingdom yet fully
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.920]   manifested.
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.520]   Here to explain how this works out from Genesis to Revelation, we welcome to the podcast Dr.
[00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.160]   Don Carson.
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.280]   Carson is the co-founder and president of the Gospel Coalition, and he's also the editor
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.920]   of the NIV Zondervan Study Bible.
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.240]   I recently talked to him on the phone and asked him to explain the doctrine of the kingdom
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.680]   as it develops from Genesis to Revelation.
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.840]   Before I start to trace out the theme of kingdom through the Bible, it will prove helpful,
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:30.360]   I think, to make four distinctions about how the word "kingdom" is used in the Bible.
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.600]   These are distinctions that every Bible reader comes to terms with with time, but they really
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.040]   are very important.
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.840]   Number one, the notion of kingdom in the Bible is often closer to what is sometimes called
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.840]   king dominion, that is, reign.
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:55.160]   When we speak of kingdom today, we often think of a realm rather than a reign, the kingdom
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.240]   of Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom.
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.280]   We're thinking of a geographical area with its people and buildings and institutions
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.840]   and so on.
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.120]   The kingdom is that over which the king reigns.
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.440]   There are some usages like that in the Bible, of course.
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:17.440]   The kingdom of Israel and the kingdom of God can be seen as the domain over which he reigns.
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.920]   But very frequently, kingdom has to do more with the reign of God rather than the realm
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.080]   of God's reign.
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.560]   And that will become important, as we'll see in due course.
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:38.280]   Second, this is a republic here in America, so our mental associations connected with
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.280]   kingdom are not necessarily very positive.
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:49.400]   The last king that Americans acknowledged didn't turn out too well, and hence the American
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.880]   Revolution.
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:58.480]   Moreover, if we think nostalgically about a monarchy today, probably for many Americans,
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.120]   the first monarch that they think of is Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.920]   And she's a constitutional monarch.
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.120]   She has precisely two powers, apart from her enormous personal influence and integrity
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.600]   and all the rest.
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.720]   But she has two powers.
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.520]   She signs legislation that gets through Parliament into law.
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.480]   And second, she can dissolve Parliament any time she wishes to.
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.800]   Yet in point of fact, if she did either of those things over against what the Parliament
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.920]   wanted, over against what the Prime Minister wanted, it would precipitate a national crisis.
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.220]   And there would be an election called, and whatever party was in power would be returned
[00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.040]   with a massive majority.
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:48.000]   So we're used to the notion of a king or a queen, a monarch, who is head of state, but
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.800]   not head of government.
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.280]   Whereas there's no such distinction in the Bible.
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.160]   If you are the king, you reign.
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.200]   That's what you do.
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.840]   You have the authority.
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.840]   So we should not be thinking United Kingdom.
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.040]   We should be thinking Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, where there is an absolute authority.
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.720]   And even then, it's often mediated through an extended family or something like that.
[00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:15.840]   And when we speak of the Kingdom of God, we're not saying that he's the constitutional monarch.
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.640]   We're not saying that he's head of state, but he doesn't reign.
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.720]   By definition, this is the reign of God.
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.000]   God rules.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   God reigns.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.800]   So that's the second distinction we simply have to come to grips with.
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:37.440]   Third, the Bible can make a distinction between the reign of God in all of God's sweeping
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.800]   sovereignty, the reign of God under which everybody falls, whether they even believe
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:49.440]   in God or not, and what might be called that subset of God's sweeping reign under which
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.680]   there is life, under which there is salvation.
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:58.440]   The first is found strongly, for example, in a psalm like Psalm 145, "I will exalt
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.080]   you, my God, the King."
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.840]   God is reigning over all.
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.040]   That's part of the point of many verses in the psalm.
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.920]   In that sense, you're in the Kingdom of God, whether you like it or not.
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.040]   You don't choose to be in that kingdom.
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:17.280]   It's part of being a creature.
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.000]   God reigns.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:26.400]   In that sense, kingdom is virtually equivalent to divine sovereignty or to divine providence.
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:32.760]   God reigns, and every one, everything, every event, every item, every matter, every thought
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.040]   is finally subject to that sovereignty.
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:42.000]   On the other hand, sometimes the kingdom is that subset of God's sovereignty under which
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   there is life.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:50.840]   For example, in John 3, verses 3 and 5, "Unless you're born again, you cannot see or enter
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:51.840]   into the kingdom."
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.880]   Well, clearly, in that sense, there are some people who are in the kingdom and some people
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:56.880]   who are not.
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.040]   That's not to be confused with God's sovereignty.
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:05.160]   It's that subset of God's sweeping sovereignty under which there is life.
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:09.160]   In that sense, then, the kingdom comes.
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:13.360]   The kingdom of God in the sovereignty sense doesn't come.
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.360]   It's here.
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.360]   It's unavoidable.
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.960]   It's eternal.
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.240]   It's primordial.
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.520]   It has come from forever and will go to forever.
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:23.640]   You cannot escape it.
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:24.920]   You're never outside it.
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:30.160]   If "kingdom" refers to that subset under which there is salvation and reconciliation and
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:35.240]   forgiveness and eternal life and so forth, then that opens up the possibility to speak
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.440]   of the kingdom coming.
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:43.000]   It can then be mediated through the coming of the King Paracelos.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.960]   It has to be said that this distinction, this distinction between the kingdom as God's sovereignty
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:55.840]   and the kingdom under which there is life, is not only a New Testament distinction.
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:59.380]   You can find something of the same thing, for example, in the book of Daniel.
[00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:06.360]   In Daniel chapter 4, when King Nebuchadnezzar makes his decree, he says, "How great are
[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:11.800]   his signs," speaking of God, "how mighty his wonders," Daniel 4.3.
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:15.200]   "His kingdom is an eternal kingdom.
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:19.000]   His dominion endures from generation to generation."
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:26.840]   On the other hand, in chapter 2, verse 44, when Daniel interprets Nebuchadnezzar's dream
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:33.480]   of a succession of kingdoms, we read, verse 44, "In the time of those kings, the God of
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:38.320]   heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed, nor will it be left to another
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:39.360]   people.
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:44.200]   It will crush all those kingdoms and bring them to an end, but it will itself endure
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:45.200]   forever."
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:51.880]   So, in that sense, this kingdom, of which 244 is speaking, comes.
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.080]   It's not an eternal kingdom.
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:57.160]   It comes at a certain point in redemptive history.
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:01.080]   And so it's important to understand that.
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:04.880]   And in a few places, it's not.
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:06.840]   The two themes are getting merged a wee bit.
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:10.120]   Think, for example, of the parable of the wheat and the tares, or the wheat and the
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:11.120]   weeds.
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:17.520]   It's with the kingdom of God, as it is with the parable of the wheat and the weeds.
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:22.320]   That is, a farmer goes forth to sow, sows good seed, but then an enemy comes in and
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:24.320]   sows a lot of weeds.
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:29.300]   And the disciples want to go out immediately and pull the weeds.
[00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:37.520]   But the master says, "No, wait until the end, and then a distinction will be made."
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:45.640]   So at one level, that means that this dawning kingdom is a kingdom that allows weed and
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:51.860]   wheat to grow together in anticipation of a consummated kingdom, where there will be
[00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:54.840]   a final division that is absolute.
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:58.400]   So here you've got a couple of distinctions being made.
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:05.560]   The kingdom comes with the sowing of the seed, but it's being contested so that under this
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:11.280]   coming of the kingdom, you have not only a sphere of life, but a distinction between
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:17.280]   what has been done in the past—the wheat hadn't started to be sown—and what is happening
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:18.280]   now.
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:23.060]   The wheat is being sown, but yet a distinction between the wheat being sown and the tares
[00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:24.240]   also being sown.
[00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:30.360]   So you've really got a mixture of the second and the third distinctions mingled together
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:36.520]   in one parable, and then introducing the fourth distinction, the difference between the present
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:37.520]   and the future.
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:40.600]   There is a sense in which the kingdom has dawned with the coming of Christ.
[00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:43.880]   There's a sense in which the kingdom is not yet.
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:48.520]   So on the one hand, Jesus, after his resurrection, can say, "All authority is given to me in
[00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:50.560]   heaven and on earth."
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:51.560]   So he reigns already.
[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:54.760]   We'll see more of that in a few moments.
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:10:00.960]   But not only does he reign with all authority, all of God's mediated authority runs through
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:03.520]   him according to 1 Corinthians 15.
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:09.200]   And yet under that mediatorial reign of King Jesus, that reign is being contested.
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.480]   It's being challenged.
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:13.060]   There are weeds as well as wheat.
[00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:17.320]   But the time is coming when the kingdoms of this world become the kingdoms of our God,
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:20.060]   when the last enemy will be destroyed.
[00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:23.520]   And so there's a distinction to be made between the present and the future.
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:27.160]   And that is what stands then behind the Lord's Prayer.
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:32.440]   Your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:33.840]   So here's a distinction.
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:40.360]   God's will is being done without being contested in heaven.
[00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:44.160]   There will come a time in the new heaven and the new earth when it will not be contested
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.160]   anywhere.
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:48.600]   But right now it is being contested, even though Christ is reigning, even though God's
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.640]   sovereignty is not removed.
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:56.880]   But there is a sense in which it is still being contested, and therefore we pray, "Your
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:57.880]   kingdom come."
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:00.960]   That is, in a fashion in which it is no longer contested.
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:05.440]   So all of these subtleties and the notion of kingdom have to be borne in mind when we
[00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:10.160]   start wrestling with the way the kingdom theme begins to develop and run through the whole
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:11.680]   of Holy Scripture.
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:17.760]   Now we want to follow how it develops through the Scripture, and we begin, as always, with
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:20.360]   creation and fall.
[00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:29.440]   Just as other themes find their rootage in Genesis 1, 2, and 3, so also kingdom.
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:34.400]   And just as these other themes find their rootage in Genesis 1, 2, and 3 without the
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:40.600]   technical terms showing up, so also with kingdom.
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:46.200]   For example, the notion of covenant is introduced in these chapters without the word showing
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:55.240]   up; the notion of sacrifice for sin is introduced, but only in a gentle, preliminary, anticipatory
[00:11:55.240 --> 00:12:03.480]   sort of way, when you have the skin coverings made for the people who have fallen into rebellion
[00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:05.320]   against God.
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:12.000]   More than a dozen themes develop in these first two or three chapters without actually
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.360]   being teased out in any sort of detail.
[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:17.700]   They anticipate; they point the way forward.
[00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:23.640]   So also the doctrine of the Trinity is not established in the first three chapters of
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:24.640]   Genesis.
[00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:29.400]   There's nothing like what you find in John chapter 14 and following.
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:36.640]   But on the other hand, there is this hint, "Let us create mankind in our image."
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:45.240]   And that plural reference, self-reference to God, is seminal; it's evocative; it begins
[00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:49.640]   to point forward to what is teased out much later in Scripture.
[00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:54.820]   So also for the notion of kingdom, there is no use of the word "king" or "kingdom"
[00:12:54.820 --> 00:13:00.680]   in these opening chapters, and yet what you get is a picture of God reigning.
[00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:08.120]   He is the king; he exists, and he, by his decree, calls the world into being.
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:11.720]   He establishes what is right and wrong.
[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:15.000]   He rules; he holds people accountable.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.480]   In all of these ways, the notion of kingdom is bound up with the doctrine of creation
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.580]   right from the very beginning.
[00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:30.020]   But it's not too long until you find kingdom used in a more restrictive sense, not for
[00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:37.240]   all of creation, but for the sphere that takes in the covenant people of God.
[00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:42.160]   Perhaps the most crucial passage, initially, is Exodus chapter 19.
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:47.120]   On the first day of the third month after the Israelites left Egypt on that very day,
[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:49.720]   they came to the desert of Sinai.
[00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:55.280]   After they set out from Rephidim, they entered the desert of Sinai, and Israel camped there
[00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:57.680]   in the desert in front of the mountain.
[00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:03.140]   Then Moses went up to God, and the Lord called to him from the mountain and said, "This
[00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:08.260]   is what you are to say to the descendants of Jacob, and what you are to tell the people
[00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:09.680]   of Israel.
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:15.600]   You yourselves have seen what I did to Egypt, and how I carried you on eagles' wings and
[00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.240]   brought you to myself.
[00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:23.400]   Now if you obey me fully and keep my covenant, then out of all nations you will be my treasured
[00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:25.240]   possession.
[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:31.360]   Although the whole earth is mine, you will be for me a kingdom of priests and a holy
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.800]   nation.
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:36.760]   These are the words you are to speak to the Israelites."
[00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:42.240]   So on the one hand, God reigns over everybody and everything and all the nations.
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:48.360]   And on the other hand, there is a sense in which the Israelites are peculiarly the people
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:49.360]   of God.
[00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:52.320]   They are peculiarly a kingdom of priests.
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:59.440]   And now in this sense, you're not only facing a more restricted realm, but also the focus
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:02.440]   is on the realm rather than the reign.
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:04.880]   They are the kingdom of priests.
[00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:10.320]   What's interesting then is that that theme is taken up and applied to the new covenant
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:13.720]   people of God in 1 Peter 2, verse 9.
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:16.160]   The same thing there is addressed to Christians.
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:23.920]   So exactly the same kingdom of priests language is picked up in 1 Peter 2, 9 and in Revelation
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:25.240]   1, 6.
[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:32.720]   Then the notion of God as king, the God who rules over his people, is very common in the
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:42.800]   Old Testament and traces in many ways to this use of kingdom in Exodus 19, 1-6.
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:44.080]   So God is the king.
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:45.800]   God is the lawgiver.
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:47.880]   God is the one who judges his people.
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:49.600]   God is the one who is sovereign.
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:55.120]   And so Moses and other leaders are regularly seen then as under-reigners.
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:16:02.760]   It's not a very useful word, but God's spokesman, God is reigning through them.
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:06.320]   And it's in that connection that shepherd language is often used.
[00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:13.440]   Shepherd language has many elements to the image, but the shepherd cares for the sheep,
[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:17.920]   rules over the sheep, disciplines the sheep, provides for the sheep, and all of those notions
[00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:20.760]   are bound up with the notion of kingdom in the ancient world where you're not thinking
[00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:23.000]   of a constitutional monarch.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.840]   It's worth remembering, for example, the book by Tim Laniac, "Shepherds After My Own Heart."
[00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:33.920]   The kings of Israel, about whom I'll say more in a few moments, are under-kings.
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:36.680]   They are under God's kingship.
[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:44.760]   So this notion of God as king runs right through Holy Scripture, with God being the particular
[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:50.960]   king, the peculiar king of his kingdominion, and of the people who are then called his
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:52.620]   kingdom of priests.
[00:16:52.620 --> 00:17:01.400]   But already in the time of Moses, there is an anticipation of the time when God will
[00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:04.480]   raise up a human king over his people.
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:07.160]   Moses is not called king, although in many ways he reigns.
[00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:12.800]   Joshua is not called king, though of course there are many ways in which he reigns.
[00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:19.900]   But already in the book of Deuteronomy, there is the anticipation of the time when there
[00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:23.760]   will be a king who must act in a certain way.
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:29.200]   Perhaps the most telling passage is Deuteronomy chapter 17, verses 14 and following.
[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:33.480]   "When you enter the land the Lord your God is giving you, and have taken possession of
[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:38.320]   it and settled in it, and you say, 'Let us set a king over us, like all the nations around
[00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:42.680]   us,' be sure to appoint over you a king the Lord your God chooses.
[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:45.520]   He must be from among your fellow Israelites.
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:49.240]   Do not place a foreigner over you, one who is not an Israelite.
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:53.720]   The king, moreover, must not acquire a great number of horses for himself, or make the
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:56.360]   people return to Egypt to get more of them.
[00:17:56.360 --> 00:18:00.120]   For the Lord has told you, 'You are not to go back that way again.'
[00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:03.440]   He must not take many wives, or his heart will be led astray.
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:07.040]   He must not accumulate large amounts of silver and gold.
[00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:11.700]   When he takes the throne of his kingdom, he is to write for himself on a scroll a copy
[00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:15.640]   of this law, taken from that of the Levitical priests.
[00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:20.440]   It is to be with him, and he is to read it all the days of his life, so that he may learn
[00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:26.480]   to revere the Lord his God, and follow carefully all the words of this law and these decrees,
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:31.240]   and not consider himself better than his fellow Israelites, and turn from the law to the right
[00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:32.240]   or to the left.
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:36.680]   Then he and his descendants will reign a long time over his kingdom in Israel."
[00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:43.560]   In other words, they'll reign—that's the active notion of rule—over the kingdom of
[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:44.560]   the Israelites.
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:47.440]   That's the notion of realm.
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:52.840]   And thus you see a picture of a coming king who is, on the one hand, authoritative.
[00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:53.840]   He rules.
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:55.320]   He reigns over the people.
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:19:00.760]   And yet, on the other hand, he is under God's authority, so much so that the first responsibility
[00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:08.920]   he has when he takes on the throne is not to appoint a secretary of state, or to arrange
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:11.680]   for the military, or to water the books of his predecessors.
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:16.960]   His first job is to write out longhand the words of the book of the law, and that will
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:22.960]   be his reading copy every day of his life, as long as he lives, so that he learns not
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:27.360]   to turn to the left or to the right, away from the Word of God.
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:33.360]   If those few verses in Deuteronomy 17 had been followed, all of Old Testament history
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:34.600]   would have been different.
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:41.800]   So that's the anticipation of the coming of a king, even in the time of Moses.
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:46.120]   Then finally the people do get in the land, and in the days of the judges there are these
[00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:51.960]   wretched cycles that see the people spiraling down into idolatry again and again.
[00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:57.360]   God raises up not kings, but judges who have some kind of kingly function.
[00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:02.240]   They rule, they lead the people, and they hold the people to account, and they fight
[00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:06.640]   off the Midianites, or they fight off the Philistines, and so on.
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:10.800]   But then it's not long, a generation or two, and everything cycles down again.
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:15.920]   Gradually the cry becomes stronger and stronger, "Oh God, how we need a king."
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:21.320]   In those days, everyone did that which was right in his own eyes, "How we need a king."
[00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:27.760]   And so there is a kind of wretched tendency towards sin, and a hope that a king would
[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:31.760]   hold people in line and fight their battles for them.
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:37.600]   But when the people do ask for a king, they ask with the most appalling motives.
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:44.000]   They think that a human king is going to save them in a way that God, the king, cannot.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:50.920]   So God, in the time of Samuel, lets them have a king, and even gives them one that seems
[00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:53.240]   promising, King Saul.
[00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:59.480]   But Saul turns out to be a very insecure man who wants to take over not only the kingdom,
[00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:07.500]   but also the priesthood, and eventually he falls in disgrace, he dies, there is no succession,
[00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:08.800]   there is no dynasty.
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:14.080]   And that's when God raises up a man whom he calls, "A man after my own heart, a king after
[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:15.080]   my own heart."
[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:19.360]   That brings us to the great passage, 2 Samuel, chapter 7.
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:26.800]   So in 2 Samuel, chapter 7, by which time King David has been installed, King David appears
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:34.200]   as the king whom God's own appointment, and reigns for seven years in Hebron over the
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:41.520]   southern tribes, then another 33 years over the whole 12 tribes of the capital in Jerusalem.
[00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:45.820]   And he wants to build a temple for God.
[00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:51.120]   But God says that he, God, will build a house that is a dynasty for David.
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:55.240]   And thus the Davidic dynasty is finally wonderfully established.
[00:21:55.240 --> 00:22:00.720]   That becomes one of the major storyline threads right through all of the Bible.
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:06.120]   The Davidic dynasty, the Davidic dynasty, the Davidic dynasty, and even the promise
[00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:13.400]   that there will be a continuity in this succession, there will be a succession that lasts forever,
[00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:19.160]   which can only be fulfilled, finally, by a king that replaces his father, and another
[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:24.640]   king that replaces that father, and another king that replaces that father, or, conceivably,
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:28.000]   please God, a king who would actually live forever.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:35.320]   And that promise takes place about 1000 BC, during the time of King David himself.
[00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:42.200]   Then in the late 8th century, in the time of the prophet Isaiah, you find more references
[00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:44.520]   to the Davidic king.
[00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:50.560]   To us, a child is born, to us a son is given, and he will reign on the throne of his father
[00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:51.560]   David.
[00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:53.200]   So we're talking about the Davidic dynasty.
[00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:57.120]   Of the increase of his kingdom, there will be no end.
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:01.360]   But he shall also be called the wonderful counselor, the mighty God, the everlasting
[00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:03.280]   father, the prince of peace.
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:09.200]   So now you have an anticipation of a kingship that is being so associated with God himself
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:16.640]   that it's unlike any Davidic king that has appeared up to that point, or that is anticipated
[00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:18.560]   in the near future.
[00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:21.520]   And there are other hints along the line.
[00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:27.080]   The prophecy of Micah, chapter 5, too, that this coming, crowning king will be born in
[00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:29.880]   Bethlehem.
[00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:33.480]   And then using the shepherd language that's already been introduced in Ezekiel, chapter
[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:39.640]   34, God himself says again and again and again that he will come and shepherd his people.
[00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:43.000]   That's equivalent to God saying he will come and reign.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.640]   He will come and rule over them directly.
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:45.640]   He will nurture them.
[00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:48.080]   He will provide them with the food and the water they need.
[00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:49.560]   He will discipline them.
[00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:51.080]   He will separate sheep from goats.
[00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:53.440]   He will be their shepherd.
[00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:56.480]   It's shepherd language to talk about his coming kingdom.
[00:23:56.480 --> 00:24:01.960]   And then at the end of that, he says, after declaring about 25 times that he will come
[00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:07.000]   and reign, then he says, "I will send my servant David to do so."
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:13.120]   So again, you're seeing the coming of God himself in the coming of the promised Davidic
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:15.680]   king.
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:22.760]   And so we could trace out more of the drama of the Old Testament when Jerusalem falls
[00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:31.740]   and the nation of Judah follows the fate of the nation of Israel off into exile.
[00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:35.080]   And there is no Davidic king in Jerusalem.
[00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:37.640]   It just seems so bleak for the covenant people of God.
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:39.000]   Where are the promises of God?
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.640]   The temple is destroyed.
[00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:41.960]   There's no Davidic king.
[00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:43.440]   They know who it should be.
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:47.520]   The genealogical records are maintained, but he's not on the throne.
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:54.840]   And then the people of God return after the end of the exile, and the Nedo-Persians allow
[00:24:54.840 --> 00:25:00.840]   them back under Cyrus and Darius, under Artaxerxes and so forth.
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:03.280]   And the city is rebuilt.
[00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:04.280]   The temple is rebuilt.
[00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:07.960]   The temple first, then the city, the city under Nehemiah.
[00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:11.800]   But still there's no Davidic king.
[00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:18.280]   And then you turn to the pages of the New Testament, and the first words you read are
[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:24.760]   the origins of Jesus Christ, the son of Abraham, the son of David.
[00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:29.880]   And then you begin with a genealogy, a genealogy slightly artificially constructed into three
[00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:38.200]   fourteens, where the central fourteens are the years of the Davidic monarchy, the Davidic
[00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:40.840]   line, the Davidic dynasty.
[00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:50.560]   And now what you have is the coming of Jesus, who is legally in line to take up that claim.
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:56.840]   And so the Magi come and ask, "Where is he who was born king of the Jews?"
[00:25:56.840 --> 00:26:03.960]   And when John the Baptist and Jesus begin to preach, they use the same words, "Repent,
[00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:07.280]   for the kingdom of heaven is near."
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:10.800]   And they probably mean near in slightly different ways.
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:15.040]   John the Baptist seems to mean it in the sense, the kingdom is impending.
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:17.560]   It's just around the corner.
[00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:23.940]   Jesus is maybe saying the same thing, but may also have another overtone in his utterance.
[00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:24.940]   It's near you.
[00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:26.320]   It has come, and it's near you.
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:31.640]   It is close, for he himself is there.
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:39.680]   And then whether you're talking about the Sermon on the Mount or the parables of Jesus
[00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:45.080]   and so many of his miracles, the kingdom theme is never far away.
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:46.400]   Who inherits the kingdom?
[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:52.040]   Well, the Beatitudes address that question.
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:56.880]   We are to pursue the kingdom of God and his righteousness, knowing that all other things
[00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:00.800]   will be added to us in Matthew 6.33.
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:06.320]   And the miracles of healing and of raising the dead and the transformation, all of these
[00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:10.400]   things are announcements that the kingdom is near.
[00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:11.400]   It's dawning.
[00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:12.400]   It's present.
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:14.560]   It's manifesting itself.
[00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:22.440]   And at the same time, there is patently misunderstanding on the part of the disciples as to how the
[00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:25.000]   kingdom will manifest itself.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:32.560]   One of the most striking passages in this regard, of course, is Matthew 20, verses 20-28,
[00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:34.160]   with a parallel in Mark.
[00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:39.680]   And on this occasion, the two brothers, James and John, approach Jesus with their mother.
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:47.720]   And what they're really asking for is a leg up when the kingdom dawns, when he, Jesus,
[00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:55.280]   enters into his kingdom, that is, into what they take to be the full plenitude of a restored
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:28:03.920]   Israel with powerful dominion over the nations and a great display of righteousness and integrity
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:05.000]   and authority.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:10.720]   They want to be senior administrators above the other disciples in that kingdom.
[00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:14.720]   Grant that one of these two sons of mine may sit at your right and the other at your left
[00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:15.720]   in your kingdom.
[00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:22.080]   And it turns out that they don't really understand at all what that kingdom is going to be like.
[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:24.560]   Can you drink the cup I'm going to drink?
[00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:26.280]   He's going to drink the cup of the cross.
[00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:27.720]   Can they go there?
[00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:30.760]   They have no idea what they're saying when they reply, "We can."
[00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:34.320]   They think that they'll follow Jesus courageously no matter what.
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:38.040]   And Jesus says, "Well, there's a sense, of course, in which you will drink from my cup.
[00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:41.100]   After all, one of them would become the first apostolic martyr and the other would end his
[00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:42.320]   life in exile.
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:44.480]   So in that sense, they'll suffer too.
[00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:48.080]   But it's up to my heavenly Father to grant these things."
[00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:53.080]   And then when the ten other apostles hear about this, they're indignant.
[00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:58.400]   And they're indignant because those two got their gibs in first, not because they're indignant
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:00.440]   that what they did was wrong.
[00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:03.760]   And that's when Jesus calls them all together and says, "You know that the rulers of the
[00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:08.840]   Gentiles lorded over them and their high officials exercise authority over them.
[00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:10.400]   Not so with you.
[00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:15.280]   Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wants
[00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:17.400]   to be first among you must be your slave."
[00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:24.480]   And it's sort of passages like this that we have sometimes spoken of servant leadership.
[00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:28.480]   Jesus is the servant king, which does not mean that he is less of a servant.
