[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400]   Whoa, whoa, whoa, Saks found the gel.
[00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.560]   Oh my God.
[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.400]   This guy, he's running for office.
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.200]   If he shows up with a red tie next week, we're fucked.
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.160]   That's the end of the show.
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.240]   He shows up with a red tie and a blue shirt.
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.320]   Are you coming out of your law retirement?
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.400]   Are you going to be an active lawyer defending Trump?
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.880]   Saks, you look really good, I got to say, with the gel.
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.560]   That looks, that's a really good look.
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.400]   That's kind of the shower, used a comb.
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.320]   Oh, the weekly shower in Italy?
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.120]   Good look, right?
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.160]   It's not a bad look.
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:26.960]   Did you use soap?
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.240]   Did you, uh, did you...
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.120]   Oh no.
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.440]   Oh no.
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.240]   I didn't have time.
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.280]   Didn't have 90 seconds?
[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.960]   Yeah, I didn't want to keep you guys waiting another two minutes.
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:58.000]   All right, everybody, welcome to another episode of the All In podcast.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.200]   It is August, and we just might have had the most consequential week in terms of politics
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.760]   and science in a long time.
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.520]   Could be, could be the week of the year.
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:15.360]   Freeberg's been going nuts inside the group chat because everyone is trying to replicate
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.840]   this LK99 room temperature semiconductor experiment.
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:20.640]   Superconductor.
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.400]   Superconductor, yes.
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:30.400]   So, God, I mean, this has been, what has it been, like 10 days, and now everybody is on
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.000]   Twitter trying to recreate this.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.120]   Maybe I should just let you cue this up, Freeberg, since this is the first time, perhaps the
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.040]   last, that we're going to start the show at Science Corner.
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.720]   So, Science Corner takeover week.
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.600]   Tell us, is this legit?
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.280]   Because you flip from this is a fraud to this is changing the world, like, every day you
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.960]   seem to have a new piece of evidence.
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.560]   Where are you today with this?
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.360]   Is this the real deal?
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.720]   I mean, it's probably somewhere in the middle, but it leads to a path that could get us to
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.920]   the holy grail, which is room temperature superconducting material, which we've talked
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.880]   about twice on the show before, and I encourage folks to go look at the episode we did a couple
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.440]   ago after the original claim was made a few months ago that turned out to not be true.
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:20.320]   But the description in the paper that came out on how to make this material was chased
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.040]   by hundreds of labs around the world over the last few days.
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.680]   Folks have been live streaming it on these Chinese websites, Billy Billy and Twitter
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:28.640]   and Twitch.
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:36.560]   Everyone from Russian scientists to Chinese to Korean to American to European.
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.000]   I will say one thing that I think is really profound, which it is, this is the first time
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:50.800]   in a very long time that I've seen so many people share a unified voice about optimism,
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.680]   about an abundant future, optimism about a big breakthrough, rather than get on social
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:02.080]   media to share a voice about fear and anger at someone or something and to hear everyone
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.400]   around the world get together and be excited about the potential of this discovery and
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.200]   its applications.
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.440]   It's really profound to see and it's really amazing and wonderful to see.
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:19.200]   Now, where we are, a bunch of labs took the described chemical structure of this material,
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:25.840]   LK99, which has lead and phosphorus, oxygen and some copper in it, and put it into these
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.240]   modeling systems, these computer modeling systems to try and understand where do the
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.880]   electrons flow, where do the electrons sit in this material if this material is made
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:35.760]   the way it's described.
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:42.320]   And five different labs have now published papers that show that the way that this material
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:48.800]   is supposedly produced, it should create these pathways or these energy states with the electrons
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.560]   that theoretically could enable superconductivity at a very high temperature.
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:59.280]   And so that's a very confirmatory signal that computer modeling of the electron clouds,
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.680]   because remember, electrons, even though they move around the nucleus of an atom, we only
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.400]   kind of have a probability statement of where they are.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.320]   So if you look at all the probability statements of all the atoms stuck together, and you try
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:15.600]   and figure out what's the aggregate probability of where electrons are, it indicates that
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.400]   there are these pathways that theoretically could allow for electrons to move freely through
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:26.000]   the material and be completely void of any sort of resistance, which is superconductivity.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.440]   And so that's what's really profound about the modeling outputs from five very separate
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.320]   independent labs.
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:38.880]   Just so we're clear, when electricity normally moves down an electric wire or in computers
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:44.720]   and CPUs, GPUs, whatever, there's resistance, that resistance results in loss, it results
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:45.200]   in heat.
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:50.640]   And the only way we've been able to reduce that loss is by making it freezing cold, like
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:51.760]   significantly cold.
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:52.400]   Totally right.
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.960]   Yeah.
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:58.320]   So now if we were to do this, when we didn't have to make a cold, that means that these
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.560]   superconducting experiments move from the laboratory where it's forced to be cold to
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.440]   the real world, our desktop, you used an analogy in chat that was really interesting of like,
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:12.000]   a superconducting road, where and then you don't lose energy right now, how much energy
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.480]   do we lose transporting it to our houses?
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.800]   Right.
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:20.560]   So, you know, I would say on the order of 70% of energy we produce is lost to heat and
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.280]   friction.
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.720]   Think about moving a car down the road, when you move a car down the road, you're having
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.600]   to put energy and to overcome the friction of the car hitting the road.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.360]   So if the car could hover above the road, the friction goes away and the energy needed
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.120]   to move the car goes way, way down.
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.120]   When you build a data center, the electrons that are moving through the copper and the
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.120]   semiconductors bump into other atoms, when they bump into the atoms in the material,
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.480]   they shake those atoms.
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.400]   When atoms shake, that is heat.
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.000]   So that's why copper wire heats up when you put electricity through it, you're moving
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.960]   electrons through it.
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:53.120]   Some of those electrons bump into the copper atoms, shakes the copper atoms, they get hot,
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.640]   and then some of the electrons make their way through.
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:00.320]   The rate at which electrons are bumping into other atoms is the resistance of the material.
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:01.200]   So, said plainly...
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:05.360]   And so all this energy is going into cooling down data centers and all this energy is lost
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.760]   in computing to heat.
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:13.360]   And same in electric motors could be reinvented, semiconductors, integrated circuits would
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.240]   be reinvented.
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.840]   And like I said, if you had enough of this material, you could put it in roads.
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:22.320]   And because superconductors also reflect magnetic fields, you could put magnets on the bottom
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:26.160]   of cars and float them above the ground and cruise around without any friction.
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.800]   And if any of this is true, this 70% loss of...
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:36.720]   and then all this energy put into cooling data centers, we could be looking at doubling
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:41.840]   or tripling the amount of energy available because we built a certain amount of energy
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:42.560]   infrastructure.
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.720]   So this would be all gains if we could figure out how to leverage this technology.
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:52.080]   Massive gains and massive abundance, it would lower the cost of electricity by 10%,
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:52.480]   100%.
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:56.960]   I mean, look, assuming huge infrastructure investments, which would take probably decades
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.880]   to do, you would get there.
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.280]   But in the near term, there are these incredible applications.
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:06.560]   Quantum computers are built using little superconductors as the qubit.
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.120]   And so the superconductor holds the qubit state.
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:13.520]   So this idea that we could now have room temperature quantum computing is also a very
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.000]   profound one, game changer, low cost.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.200]   And the first thing that would be changed is likely electronic components.
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:23.680]   So we would take electronic components and redesign them using superconducting material
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.920]   that would allow you to reduce heat loss and energy loss.
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:30.400]   And that would have a big transformative effect on, for example, the big effort right now
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.760]   to make more AI chips, GPU chips to do matrix transformations.
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:35.280]   There is some precedent for this.
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:41.680]   People are now creating optical bridges between GPUs and CPUs in order to reduce the heat.
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:45.840]   So they're using optics, basically light to transfer data.
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:46.400]   Interconnects.
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.040]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:52.000]   That's been the big lift right now, from what I understand, in GPUs and data centers is
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.760]   you still have to convert data.
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:56.320]   Yeah, it's, I mean, we could go on for hours on that.
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:59.600]   But like, yes, I mean, this would just be a game changer, electronic component, right?
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:00.480]   Photonic chips, right?
[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.160]   Photonic chips.
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.080]   But look, this is obviously a little bit separate.
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.000]   But here's where we are.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.360]   So LK99, there's all these simulation models that show this thing could work.
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:13.120]   But there's two things I will say came out of this from some of the simulations.
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:18.160]   The first is, remember, this is a crystal with mostly lead atoms.
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:21.760]   And these lead atoms, some of them get replaced by copper.
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:28.080]   And when they get replaced by copper, it causes the crystal structure to change by 0.46 degrees,
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:28.960]   is what the Koreans say.
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.880]   The angle changes by 0.46 degrees.
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:35.520]   And when that happens, that bending causes the electrons in all the atoms in the crystal
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:36.960]   to overlap slightly.
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:41.520]   And that overlapping effect causes this free-flowing electron tunnel.
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:45.040]   That is the theory for why the superconducts.
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:51.280]   Now, what the simulation showed is that you have to replace only one of the lead atoms,
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:53.520]   not any of the other ones, in order for this to work.
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:57.360]   And that could explain why everyone's having different results in the lab trying to reproduce
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.000]   this.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.880]   Because when you bake this stuff in an oven, if the copper gets into the wrong atom space
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:04.560]   in the crystal, it doesn't work.
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:08.400]   And so that's why some of these things might end up looking good, and some of them don't
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:08.720]   look good.
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:13.600]   And some of them, there was a lab yesterday in China that published no resistance, but
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:17.120]   they had to cool it down to 100 degrees below freezing.
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:20.800]   And so it wasn't at room temperature, but it did superconduct, it did have no resistance.
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.880]   >> 170 Kelvin, I think is where they got it.
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.280]   >> Yeah, so 100 below zero Celsius.
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:30.240]   >> So in other words, there is a key here in the molecular structure that you have to
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.520]   just thread perfectly.
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:36.000]   >> You have to replace the right lead atom with the copper in order for this to work.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.640]   And so that's a technically very, and what happens by the way,
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:42.000]   >> So that's a fidelity issue, that's a tool issue, like you have to have the right tool
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.320]   to do it, or is it luck, or right now?
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:47.840]   >> So here's the crazy story, and I'll tell you guys this, I don't know how real this
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:54.320]   is, but the guys claim, so remember, these two scientists, Lee and Kim, supposedly saw
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:57.280]   this material in a lab in 1999.
[00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.840]   That's why it's called LK, Lee and Kim, '99.
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:03.600]   And so in '99, they came across this, and they could not replicate it, and they had
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.120]   no idea how to make it again.
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:07.040]   And it disappeared, and they didn't have the sample again.
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:11.760]   They then spent the next 20 years of their life, one was a college professor, and the
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:16.160]   other one worked for LG as a battery engineer, and they just had these random, normal, everyday
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:16.720]   lives.
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:20.720]   It reminds me of Dennis Quaid in the movie The Rookie, where he had this amazing arm,
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:24.080]   and he was going to go to the MLB, and then something happened, and he spent the rest
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:26.320]   of his life as a high school PE teacher.
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:30.000]   And then 20 years later, he gets his arm back, and he goes to the MLB, and he plays in a
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.200]   major league baseball game.
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:35.200]   Because all of a sudden, during COVID, these guys got some funding, they set up a company,
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:38.240]   they went into a lab, and they rediscovered this material.
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:41.680]   And apparently, this is the rumor, I don't know if this is real, the rumor is, they had
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:47.360]   it, they were baking it in an oven, in a vacuum-sealed tube, and when the guy took it out of the oven,
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:50.240]   he accidentally bumped into a table, and the tube cracked.
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:53.760]   And when the tube cracked, it did something to the material, and then they measured it,
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:56.000]   and oh my god, it's room temperature superconductor.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.640]   That's the current theory of what, the rumor of what happened in the video.
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:01.920]   That's like Peter Parker being bitten by a radioactive spider.
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:04.080]   I mean, it doesn't make any sense.
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.200]   What?
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:05.920]   Yeah.
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:06.800]   So here's the drama.
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:10.320]   This guy, Kwon, got inserted to oversee them as like their CTO.
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.880]   The guy that gave the money to Q-Center said, "He's got to oversee you."
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:17.920]   Kwon apparently got fired from his job in March, and he was kicked out of his company,
[00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:19.520]   was no longer affiliated.
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:24.000]   And the rumor is that Kwon took all the lab data, and these guys, in 2020, during COVID,
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:24.880]   they discovered this.
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:28.240]   They started filing patents and working on the manufacturing process, trying to figure
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:29.680]   out how to replicate it and do it again.
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:31.280]   They had all this data, but they weren't going to publish it.
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.040]   They didn't want the world to know about it yet.
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:36.880]   And then all of a sudden, Kwon gathers all this data, probably disgruntled after getting
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:39.920]   fired, puts it into a paper and puts it on the internet.
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:41.600]   So that's the first paper that came out.
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:46.240]   This is important because there's a website called R-A-R-X-I-V.
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:48.080]   Is there a pronunciation for this website?
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:51.840]   So this is where you can open source file scientific papers, right?
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:59.040]   Okay, so this is a place for dropping papers outside of the academia?
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:11:59.760]   Yeah.
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:04.000]   The traditional journal process requires peer review, and there's editors at the journal
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.920]   that decide whether or not to publish your paper.
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:06.560]   So sometimes...
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:07.120]   Gatekeepers.
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:07.920]   Yeah, gatekeepers.
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:10.320]   And so if you don't want to do that, you just want to get a story out to the world right
[00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:10.800]   away.
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:14.560]   So during COVID, everyone was publishing on the site, all their updates on research they
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:17.040]   were doing to help the world figure out what's going on with COVID.
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:20.960]   So it's a great place to just hit the world with your data, hit the world with your findings.
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:24.960]   This is like acoustic raw papers, and it's called Archive.
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:28.560]   A-R-X-I-V.org if you want to go see it.
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:29.040]   Archive.
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:30.880]   So anyone can publish a PDF.
[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.080]   No one knows if it's real or not.
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.760]   It hasn't been peer reviewed, etc.
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:39.440]   So this guy, Kwon, so Kwon drops the paper with his name, Lee, Kim, and Kwon on the paper.
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.120]   Only three people can win a Nobel Prize.
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:44.480]   So the theory is he did this to get his name out there to make sure he could lock in his
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:45.680]   name for the Nobel Prize.
[00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:46.480]   Wow.
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:52.080]   And then within a day, Lee and Kim and four people they've been working with, including
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:56.880]   some folks in the US, published another paper with better data, but it was also rushed out.
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:59.280]   And so both papers are pretty ugly, I gotta be honest.
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:00.800]   They're like pretty messy.
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:02.320]   They don't have a great deal of clarity.
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:03.200]   There's errors in them.
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:03.840]   There's mistakes.
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:04.640]   There's redundancy.
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:07.920]   There's little basic chart editing errors, stupid stuff.
[00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:09.600]   Clearly, this was a rushed job.
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:12.320]   But these guys rushed out and said, "You know what, if this is going to be public, we now
[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:15.040]   have to correct the story and see what happens."
[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:15.920]   So they put this thing out there.
[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:20.560]   They wanted to get their claim in to get their Nobel Peace Prize, which would indicate that
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:24.960]   would lean towards a piece of evidence, as would people funding them 25 years later.
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:27.680]   That would indicate maybe there's something there.
[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:29.200]   Two things worth noting on the simulation stuff.
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:32.400]   Number one, obviously, you got to get the copper in the right place.
[00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:36.400]   And the production way to do that, how do we actually engineer that to happen?
[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:38.160]   It's not really clear.
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:42.160]   Baking it in an oven clearly is creating what's called heterogeneous results, meaning everyone's
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:45.280]   getting different results around the world that have been doing this for the last couple
[00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:45.760]   days.
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:46.880]   And everyone's really confused.
[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:47.440]   Is this real?
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:47.920]   Is it fake?
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:48.560]   I don't know.
[00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:52.240]   But that simulation explains why there's maybe lots of different results.
[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:53.440]   Another comment.
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:57.920]   It turns out that one of the simulation teams said, "Hey, if you put gold instead of copper
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:59.840]   in the spot, it's a better superconductor.
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:01.600]   It could actually be a better material."
[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:06.640]   So it's opening up all these paths for exploration that we had never considered before, that
[00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:10.240]   there's this whole new approach to creating superconducting materials that was not on
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.360]   anyone's radar before.
[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:12.800]   So this is opening up a whole new realm.
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:17.360]   And I think this is going to unfold over the next couple of years with more material discovery,
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:22.640]   more invention coming off of this initial discovery and simulation model that then offers
[00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:26.560]   all these other opportunities for creating potentially new materials that maybe are easier
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:28.080]   to manufacture and better to produce.
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:33.120]   And the final thing I'll say is that there are some teams that are commenting, that are
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:38.080]   saying that this thing may be superconducting, but only on one dimension, which means along
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:41.760]   a line of atoms or line of molecules in the material.
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:46.880]   So normal superconductors, think about them as like a 3D matrix, and the electrons can
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:51.120]   flow freely through any direction through the matrix, through the crystal.
[00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:56.960]   And in this case, they're saying the electrons can only flow freely across a line in this
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:57.760]   material.
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:01.360]   And so now there's another question of, "Wait, how do you manufacture lots of lines to run
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:04.400]   in parallel to make this thing truly superconducting at scale?"
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:07.680]   So that's all the hard technical stuff that's emerging right now.
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:11.600]   Whether or not this actually does turn into a room temperature superconducting material
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:15.920]   that can be industrialized and used in all these applications everyone's really excited
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:19.360]   about, I think it's probably months to years away from knowing.
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:23.200]   But at this point, there's a great set of indications that, "Oh my God, we might be
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:24.160]   onto something new."
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:27.680]   There's a whole new path of discovery, a whole new path of engineering and invention.
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:31.440]   And it's amazing to just see everyone gather around this and get so excited about it, because
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:36.240]   it really will change so much about the world and create extraordinary abundance and prosperity
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:36.960]   for humanity.
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:40.480]   If this proves to be real and industrializable and scalable.
[00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:43.040]   >> Can I just ask a simple question here?
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:43.280]   >> Oh, you're good.
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:48.720]   >> When you say, "If this proves to be real," if nobody has reproduced the result, why is
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:50.080]   there any belief that this is real?
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:53.760]   >> There are properties of this that, look, I think we have to take a step back.
[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:58.720]   We have found superconductive materials in the past.
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:01.120]   There are many ceramics that are superconductive.
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:02.720]   Mercury is superconductive.
[00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:07.520]   There's all kinds of elements and materials and compounds in the physical world that we've
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:09.920]   already figured out have these properties.
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:13.440]   So this is not like a new thing that's never been found before.
[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:18.160]   It's just this idea of trying to find it at a certain temperature where it could exist
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:21.840]   naturally in the normal world without all this expensive cooling.
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:22.560]   Okay.
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:29.440]   But there is a separate thing, which is that we also have found a whole bunch of materials
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:35.200]   that look and behave like superconductors, but are really not.
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:37.040]   They're what's called just diamagnetic.
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:44.640]   I think right now what people are trying to sort out is, "Is this a clever diamagnet?
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:46.240]   Is this diamagnetism?
[00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:48.800]   Or is it superconductive?"
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:53.840]   These are huge differences that swing this from, "Yeah, it's kind of a cool thing," and,
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:54.400]   "Yeah, whatever.
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:57.920]   There's a bunch of other materials we found that are like this," to, "Wow, this is
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:58.880]   transformational."
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:00.960]   Right now, we don't know any of that.
[00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:07.200]   I think that all of the mystery around this is mostly because people can be on one side
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:12.480]   of the debate or the other literally by the second based on what new simulation or what
[00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:15.120]   new piece of research people are putting out there.
[00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:20.160]   But you have to remember, diamagnetism is like a property of matter.
[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:22.800]   Superconductivity is a state of matter.
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.720]   It is totally different.
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:29.280]   All superconductors are diamagnetic, but all diamagnets are not superconductive.
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:38.400]   So we could just be extremely excited about not much of anything, or this could really
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:39.120]   be a breakthrough.
[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:42.720]   If what the Chinese guy said is that they were able to cool this thing down and get
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:45.280]   it to be superconductive, then that does...
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:48.160]   At 170K, it doesn't mean much, in my opinion.
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:48.400]   Right.
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:53.040]   It's not room temperature, but it does indicate that this material can be superconductive.
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:54.560]   Look, there are many materials like this.
[00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:58.480]   There's a lot of forms of red matter that we've already found that at that temperature
[00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:02.480]   gradient, at that range of temperatures, can be superconductive.
[00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:05.120]   It's not practically useful at that point.
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:06.320]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:08.560]   And I don't think you're going to see some massive revolution.
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:09.600]   So I'm a betting man.
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:10.240]   I make bets.
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:14.640]   I think I've talked about when there was this guy, Ranga Diaz, that had to try this stuff,
[00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:17.200]   and he was sort of refuted in what he was working on.
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:20.880]   But 18 months before that happened, I was trying to get a deal done with the University
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:22.800]   of Rochester to buy all that IP.
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:25.920]   So I've been grinding in and around this space for a couple of years.
[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:30.000]   My intuition on this is that this is diamagnetic.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:37.840]   And I think we're going to find that it's like yet another material added to the list
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:39.760]   of materials, and it's okay.
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:46.960]   But hopefully what it really does is it sparks an interest in a lot of other people putting
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:48.080]   more money behind this.
[00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:53.840]   Nick, if you could pull up this manifold markets, there's a prediction market called manifold
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:58.640]   dot markets that people have been sharing a link from betting markets where people bet
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:05.840]   either side of this will LK 99 room temp ambient pressure serving conductivity, preprint replicate
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:06.880]   before 2025.
[00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:11.040]   And you can see it's about 30% chance you what do you think of the prediction markets
[00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:12.160]   assessing this?
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:12.640]   Freeberg?
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:17.600]   Yeah, I think that's probably that's probably a good handicap for where we are.
[00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:24.960]   I'll say when you look at a diamagnetic material, and so what that means a diamagnet will expel
[00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:31.520]   magnetic fields of both polarities, a paramagnet will reflect the north or the south pole,
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:35.040]   its north pole will reflect the north pole of another magnetic material, right?
[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:37.840]   diamagnets, you can put north or south pole and they reflect both.
[00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:43.680]   And there's plenty of videos you can watch of putting a frog in like a 10 Tesla machine
[00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:46.560]   and the frog floats technically a frog is diamagnetic.
[00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:52.160]   But what happens typically with diamagnetic materials is they orient themselves while
[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:55.040]   they're freely floating into a particular direction.
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:58.560]   So there's going to be three things people are going to be looking for in terms of confirmatory
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:00.080]   proof on LK 99.
[00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:04.000]   The first is does this material float like a superconductor over a magnetic field?
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.640]   Because remember, superconductors perfectly expel magnetic fields, they are diamagnets
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:13.120]   to the absolute degree, they perfectly reflect all magnetic fields.
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:16.800]   So if you put a superconducting material above a magnetic field, it should kind of
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:18.960]   float freely and spin around and stuff.
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:23.680]   If it orients back to one position, it probably means that there's something going on, where
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:25.920]   it's maybe not a perfect superconductor.
[00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:28.800]   Now all these videos, the second thing you're going to look for zero resistance.
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:33.200]   So can you actually pass an electric charge through it and have no resistance in the material?
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:37.040]   So you're seeing data coming out now that's indicating we're seeing that we're seeing
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:40.640]   it at a low temperature, no one's yet replicated this at room temperature.
[00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:45.040]   And the third thing is a transition, which means that there's a point where it shifts,
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:49.120]   because that's a classic characteristic of superconducting materials that there's a
[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:53.040]   transition temperature transition phase, where the material becomes superconducting, or it's
[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:53.920]   not superconducting.
[00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:59.440]   So those kind of generally those three experimental proof points are what everyone's looking for.
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:03.760]   Thus far, the videos we've seen look like UFO or Bigfoot videos.
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:05.120]   They're friggin grainy.
[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:07.840]   They're like, you know, you guys have seen some of these videos that have come out.
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:09.440]   They're like at a distance.
[00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:10.960]   It's like, wait, why didn't you do the whole angle?
[00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:12.160]   Why did you only take a picture?
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:13.120]   Why didn't you do the video?
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:19.760]   There's this woman in Russia, who's now in UFO territory, people are looking at me super
[00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:24.720]   like there's a raw, there's a little flake of here's a video of a little flake of a material
[00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:30.000]   that someone supposedly made in the lab, or it could be right, they put it over the super
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.360]   over a very strong magnet.
[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:32.320]   And this is the video they got.
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:33.040]   It's super blurry.
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:38.000]   There's a woman in Russia, and she totally reinvented the manufacturing process.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.280]   She's actually well known scientists.
[00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:40.480]   So she's not BS.
[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:44.720]   And she said, I made this thing in my house using a furnace and I use the whole new process.
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:46.000]   So she does this whole new process.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.200]   She live streams the whole thing.
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:51.280]   And then she puts out a video of the thing floating in a straw.
[00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:52.800]   It's a sorry, a video photo.
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:54.000]   And it's a blurry photo.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.640]   And people are like, show us the video show us that it's real.
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:57.920]   And she's refusing to.
[00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:01.920]   So this whole thing is feeling a little like there's UFO Bigfoot type people out there
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:04.320]   that we're not really seeing clarity on is this real.
[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:08.800]   And then obviously the resistance data, there's very credible academic universities coming out.
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:12.240]   And I will also say there are a number of labs, there's one in China, and the one in
[00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:19.840]   China that measured the zero resistance at negative 100 degrees, they created 8000 samples.
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:21.200]   So they found one that worked.
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:25.120]   There's another lab that did eight different pathways of manufacturing it in China.
[00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:27.120]   And they said, we can't find any that work yet.
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:32.560]   So you know, there's a lot of negative indications as well, which is why the prediction markets
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:33.440]   are probably right.
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:39.280]   But I do think that this theoretical explanation that you have to get the copper atom to replace
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:44.720]   the correct lead atom in the crystal structure explains a lot of the heterogeneity and results
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:46.800]   and the reason why people may not be able to replicate this.
[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:50.560]   And if someone could crack the code on how do we actually engineer this thing and produce
[00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:54.720]   it correctly, based on the theory, maybe we'll see different better results.
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:58.160]   But again, that's also theoretical, because no one seems to have nailed the manufacturing
[00:22:58.160 --> 00:22:59.280]   process here.
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:03.600]   So lots of data coming in every day, by next week, we could be clapping and, you know,
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:04.100]   cheering.
[00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:09.520]   Or, you know, we could sort of be on this very long grind, sort of like Russia, Ukraine,
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:11.120]   just a long grind.
[00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:12.960]   And it's a it'll last years.
[00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:16.640]   And maybe someone will win, maybe someone won't, or maybe it just opens up a whole new
[00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:20.480]   set of explorations for new superconducting materials at room temperature that could change
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:21.200]   the world.
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:25.600]   I gotta say the thing I love most about this is like, we have this Oppenheimer film comes
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:26.240]   out.
[00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:33.040]   And at the same time, this happens, we got UFO testimonials, you know, in congressional
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:38.160]   hearings, all of this energy at the same time, of people who are just really stoked to do
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:42.160]   material science to do basic science to figure out big problems.
[00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:49.040]   And I agree with you, the optimism around all this is, is, I mean, how fantastic else,
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:53.360]   tell me something else in our lifetime in our in the last decade or two, where we've
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:59.200]   seen the whole world, say, in a positive way, something great could happen, instead of something
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:01.280]   bad could happen, and someone's to blame for something.
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:05.120]   I mean, it really is, in my mind, the first time I've really seen this happen in a very
[00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:05.680]   long time.
[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:09.840]   Maybe the internet was a was a great moment came to me.
[00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:14.640]   Yeah, everybody being connected, everybody being able to share information, free access
[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:18.960]   to information on Twitter and Billy Billy and YouTube and like all sharing this stuff.
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:24.240]   And saying, my gosh, we could have this breakthrough together as a, as a civil as a species, not
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:29.760]   like a country, not a individual, not a who messed up who did something wrong, who's to
[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:30.880]   blame who's on the other side.
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:35.440]   It's like, dude, if we all do if this happens, we're all going to be like, chilling on the
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:36.400]   beach, it's gonna be amazing.
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:37.120]   Like, this is awesome.
[00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:42.400]   So we're gonna have, we're gonna have a rash of VCs running into this next.
[00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:46.640]   And start funding material science.
[00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:50.160]   Yeah, I mean, my attitude is kind of like, wake me up when you know, it's real.
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:59.200]   Because it's nice that if this is real, then it's great that there's all this positive
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:24:59.840]   energy around it.
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:01.760]   But that's like a big caveat.
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:04.960]   Until we know that there's something real here.
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:09.600]   I think it's premature for everybody to say that this is like some wonderful thing.
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:14.080]   Now, if we find out that the science is real, and then it's just a debate over commercialization
[00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:15.360]   of it, then yeah, I agree.
[00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:17.200]   That would be like a really positive moment.
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:20.560]   I just love the fact that when something positive in the world happens, or when something negative
[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:25.200]   happens, we have this amazing platform for everybody, social media, x.com, formerly Twitter,
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:29.520]   where everybody can get together around this campfire and just start discussing it and
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:30.160]   speculating.
[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:31.840]   Now, some people don't like speculation.
[00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:36.880]   Obviously, if there's a school shooting or a tragedy, a building burns down, the fog
[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:43.440]   of war, as we've seen, in the constant Ukraine coverage, you know, you can have, it's very
[00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:44.400]   easy to make mistakes.
[00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:49.440]   You're hashing this stuff in real time, but I love the real time nature of the world and
[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:50.480]   the pace we're moving at.
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:51.600]   It's kind of delightful to me.
[00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:55.280]   I don't have a problem with the speculation and there is a fun element to it.
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:26:00.400]   But when you start talking about investing in it, like I said, wake me up when you know
[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:00.800]   it's real.
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:04.240]   There's a really funny meme that VC Braggs posted.
[00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:06.880]   Oh, VC Braggs, shout out VC Braggs.
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:08.720]   This is good.
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:12.160]   This is a famous meme of a kid drowning.
[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:13.040]   That's so good.
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:18.000]   While the mom is playing with another kid and not paying attention to the drowning kid,
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.480]   it's sort of like the guy who's holding hands with his girlfriend, but looking over
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:24.880]   his shoulder and whistling at the other woman.
[00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:28.560]   And Superconductors is the happy little kid.
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:31.760]   VCs is the mom and Generative AI is drowning.
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:36.480]   But then they show in the underwater, yeah, somebody who's tied to a chair with chains
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:36.960]   of skeletons.
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:38.000]   The last hype cycle.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.880]   The last hype cycle, creator of Codemy Crypto M3.
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:41.920]   Yeah, it's pretty funny.
[00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:46.800]   It's pretty, I will say, I told you about this when we were in Italy last week.
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:50.080]   But when I was 13 years old, J. Cal can make fun of me now.
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:52.320]   I did a science fair project on Superconductors.
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:54.720]   Actually, I was doing it when I was 13.
[00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:58.320]   And I bought this superconductor from the back of Popular Science magazine.
[00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:00.480]   You know, this old yttrium barium copper oxide.
[00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:01.840]   That was the one that won the Nobel Prize.
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:03.280]   You could buy it for nothing.
[00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:07.040]   And I got liquid nitrogen at UCLA and I did a demo at the science fair and I did a poster
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:10.240]   board and I had hyper card on a Macintosh LC.
[00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:12.800]   And I showed everyone, this is the future.
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:14.720]   We're about to have room temperature superconductors.
[00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:16.080]   It's about to happen.
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:20.160]   And we're going to have flying cars and we're going to have limitless energy and limitless
[00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:23.040]   battery storage for energy, by the way, which is one of the big applications.
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:26.160]   And it's just on the brink.
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:28.640]   And this was when I was 13 years old, 1993.
[00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:31.520]   You know, here we are 30 years old, 30 years later.
[00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:35.680]   And everyone feels like this moment might be upon us.
[00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:38.960]   But it has been this thing that's always been elusive, that everyone's always thought is
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:39.760]   around the corner.
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:41.280]   Well, it sounds like cold fusion.
[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:45.440]   You know, we've always been 10 years away for some breakthrough in cold fusion, self-driving
[00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:48.800]   cars, artificial general intelligence.
[00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:53.600]   Well, I think there's a difference between this physical world, material sciences type
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:55.600]   innovation and then software innovation.
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:28:01.520]   And one of Peter Thiel's critiques is that we've had tremendous innovation in software,
[00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:06.320]   but in every other aspect of the economy, there's been little to no innovation.
[00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:08.720]   Planes, for example, are getting slower, not faster.
[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:11.200]   Would you believe that position from from him?
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:12.320]   I don't buy that.
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:19.040]   Well, I mean, with the exception of like what Elon has been doing with the genomic revolution,
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:21.600]   he misses life sciences entirely in that point.
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:22.080]   I don't know.
[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:25.120]   I mean, genomics is largely software based at this point.
[00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:30.160]   If you look at the whole revolution driven by gene editing, oncology, the breakthroughs,
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:31.520]   I mean, look, it's all slowing down.
[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:32.640]   I do agree with him.
[00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:37.520]   If you look at the number of approved drugs every year and the cost per drug cost per
[00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:41.840]   drug is going in the wrong direction and the number of drugs per year is going in the wrong
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:42.320]   direction.
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:45.440]   So there is an argument to be made there.
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:49.920]   But there are arguably some quantum leaps in the types of medicine that we're applying.
[00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:52.720]   We didn't have biologics, you know, 40 years ago.
[00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:55.200]   We didn't have gene therapy 10 years ago.
[00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:59.760]   These are new modalities for therapies that didn't exist as we've engineered the molecular
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:03.040]   world to do amazing things in the biochemical application space.
[00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:06.000]   So I think there's elements of this that I disagree with.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.040]   But I think the general trend lines, as he points out, is totally true.
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:11.920]   Yeah, but with planes, I think we've made a conscious decision.
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:13.200]   He always cites the plane issue.
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:15.920]   Hey, we don't have the Concorde, we're going backwards in terms of speed.
[00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:17.280]   I think that was a deliberate
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:23.760]   cost cutting measure because people aren't willing to pay to go faster and burn more
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:24.000]   fuel.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.080]   So they're making an economic decision on that.
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:27.440]   The price gets cheaper.
[00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:28.240]   That's right.
[00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:28.880]   That's right.
[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:29.600]   Same with electricity.
[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:30.160]   Same with energy.
[00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:32.960]   Electricity is getting more expensive, not cheaper.
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:38.800]   But if you look at the massive, if we wouldn't have the massive gains in artificial intelligence
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:44.160]   and machine learning, if it hadn't been for the revolution in GPU storage, and data centers and
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:47.680]   microprocessors and the iPhone.
[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:51.760]   But that's kind of the point is that we were promised flying cars and instead we got 280
[00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:52.480]   characters.
[00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:57.360]   Not that Twitter slash X is bad, but that's just where all the innovation has been is in IT.
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:58.160]   That I agree with.
[00:29:58.160 --> 00:29:58.880]   So they figure it out.
[00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:03.120]   They keep figuring out how to put more circuits on a transistor or whatever and, you know,
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:07.600]   keep Moore's law going or I could show you over the years, but I could make a different
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:11.280]   argument by showing you human lifespan and agricultural yields.
[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:16.080]   I mean, agricultural yields continue to climb because of our ability to engineer in a smarter
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:16.720]   and better way.
[00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:20.720]   Every generation there, there's a lot of counter arguments to that.
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:23.680]   I would say what's valid about it is we go ahead, Shama.
[00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:28.560]   I was going to say the reason we don't see these kinds of innovations is because the
[00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:33.360]   ruling class has clogged up and sclerotically dominated all the places where you'd have
[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:37.360]   this massive forms of innovation, like regular regularity.
[00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:39.680]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:40.640]   That's like I'm talking about.
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:42.880]   That's like a boogeyman.
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:44.320]   So get the boogeyman out.
[00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:46.160]   The regulatory captures there forever.
[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:49.120]   Like, why was this paper published on artisan?
[00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:53.760]   Because every other form of publishing mechanism is sclerotic.
[00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:54.960]   It's establishment.
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:56.240]   It's hierarchical.
[00:30:56.240 --> 00:31:00.320]   It's about people basically dominating their own little forms of payola.
[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:00.640]   Right.
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:04.160]   And so nature, JAMA, all of this stuff works this way.
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:05.120]   And so what happens?
[00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:07.520]   You don't get fundamental innovations that happen in labs.
[00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:14.800]   You have things that feed research proposals that feed people who need to basically establish
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:15.520]   their supremacy.
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:20.080]   You saw the Stanford professor get booted up because of stuff that, you know, he the president
[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:23.360]   of Stanford, the president said, so why is all this happening?
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:24.400]   Well, Peter is right.
[00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:27.680]   The reason why this stuff is happening is that instead of places where true fundamental
[00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:31.520]   innovation can happen, if you look at the Nobel Prize winners and you do distribution
[00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:32.800]   by age, what do you find?
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:37.680]   People win Nobels in their 60s for work that they did in their 20s and 30s.
[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:38.640]   Right.
[00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:43.360]   And so you have a system now that rewards people staying in their positions.
[00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:46.160]   I wrote this in one of my annual letters.
[00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:51.600]   If you look at the average age of like leading people in schools, they're like 70 years old.
[00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:56.720]   If you look inside of Congress, so there's all of this stuff that just kind of sclerotically
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:32:02.000]   prevents young, naive people from basically going out and really pushing the boundaries
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.120]   in specifically this case of science, of fundamental science.
[00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:10.080]   And so for every innovation, I think the question to ask is what other innovations are we missing?
[00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:16.880]   And if innovations are on a fundamentally well-established pathway that defends a bunch
[00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:19.840]   of work of senior people before it, it'll get supported.
[00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:22.720]   And I would say that genetics is a perfect example of that.
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:23.920]   The other thing,
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:27.440]   If you look at the, if you look at the number of rare diseases that have still that are
[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:31.760]   still like unsolved or the lack of understanding of immuno disease, it's just crazy.
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:34.480]   Like it's, I just think that that's really what's happening.
[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:36.080]   I think Peter's more right than he's wrong.
[00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:40.320]   The other issue here, Saxe is, and I'd like to get your feedback on this is if you look
[00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:44.880]   at how venture capital works, you got a 10 year window, you want to get returns for your
[00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:50.000]   LPs, you look at how this fundamental research, we just said this started in 1999, that's
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.840]   why it's called dash 99.
[00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:58.560]   This thing took 25 years to get to this point is part of this issue that you have this big
[00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:05.440]   opportunity zone between say ventures window 10 years, and then academia, which you put
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:10.400]   at like four decades there, Chumaf, 20 year olds getting their rewards in their 60s.
[00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:14.560]   How much of this has to do with, we don't have a platform in between venture
[00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:15.760]   and academia.
[00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:16.480]   That's not the problem.
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:24.080]   So it's true that VC funding, typically you want to go to the commercialization of an
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:28.320]   idea and that the underlying platform shift already exists.
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:32.160]   And usually that comes from some sort of breakthrough that happened in academia.
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:33.920]   I mean, that's basically what happened with the internet.
[00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:41.920]   So yeah, you do not want VC funding typically going to basic R and D, fundamental science
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:42.560]   R and D.
[00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:46.240]   It's just really expensive, takes too long and too unknown.
[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:49.520]   So you want that stuff kind of done more at the academic level.
[00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:55.200]   The question I have is how much of what's happening in academia is basically either
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:56.640]   irrelevant or fraudulent.
[00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:59.120]   So Chumaf, you brought up the Stanford president.
[00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:06.000]   I think the story there is he had five papers about Alzheimer's research and related topics
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:12.560]   like that, where they found out that the papers are basically bogus and quasi fraudulent.
[00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:17.280]   So how much of the work that's being done in academia, how many of these papers are
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:19.040]   basically bogus?
[00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:23.040]   Well, the thing with peer review is like, it's presented like it's a great, incredible
[00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:27.600]   solution to the world's problems, but I think what it has inherently wrong with it.
[00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:31.760]   So the positive part of it is theoretically you have error correction, right?
[00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:36.160]   But here, what you don't find is that that error correction actually even happened.
[00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:40.560]   And so it takes like some young 20 year old kid at Stanford who's a journalist, whose
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:42.960]   family were journalists to basically figure that out.
[00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:44.800]   So instead, what were those journals?
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:46.240]   What were those papers doing?
[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:50.400]   They were supporting a rising up and coming person because they thought that, you know,
[00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:51.840]   he would support them at some point.
[00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:54.800]   This is like the whole corrupt Fauci system at the NIH.
[00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:58.720]   Friedberg, Chumaf and Sachs are presenting academia as corrupt.
[00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:00.160]   Do you agree with that?
[00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:04.240]   I don't know if corrupt is the right term, because I think that implies malintent.
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:06.240]   I think that the incentives are wrong.
[00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:09.520]   So in order to get funded, you have to show results.
[00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:13.680]   No one gets a grant to disprove someone else's work.
[00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:17.680]   No one gets a grant to do confirmatory work on someone else's work.
[00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:19.520]   You get a grant.
[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:20.000]   You get it.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:20.240]   Yeah.
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:22.880]   I mean, that's that's the argument that some folks make.
[00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:26.560]   You get a grant to do breakthrough research and have breakthroughs.
[00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:28.880]   And if you have breakthroughs, you get more money.
[00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:30.480]   That's the way the system is set up.
[00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:32.480]   But this is why this guy this is why.
[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:34.160]   Well, let me just say it's corrupt.
[00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:35.280]   I think it's corrupt.
[00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:36.960]   There's no funding for breakthroughs.
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:37.840]   Come on.
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:42.560]   OK, whatever you want to define it as the guy at Stanford, if you read some of the testimony
[00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:47.360]   from people in his labs, they said that he encouraged people to have big findings.
[00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:50.560]   And if you get big findings, you get to progress in the organization.
[00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:52.560]   You get more funding, et cetera.
[00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:57.040]   So the the incentive structure that he set up for people was not necessarily to go in
[00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:00.640]   and disprove stuff or try something and show that it didn't work.
[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:04.880]   If you try something and show that it didn't work and publish a paper on that, it's going
[00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:08.960]   to be very hard for you to turn around and get a trophy or get some money or get a grant.
[00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:09.920]   He did.
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:13.120]   There was like a bunch of error in the data that they went back and were like, hey, this
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:14.160]   is this is incorrect.
[00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:16.160]   And he's like, oh, yeah, it was sloppy.
[00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:17.840]   I just didn't do a good job of reviewing it.
[00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:18.880]   So yeah.
[00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:22.400]   So what happened was, if you read some of the testimony, the people that worked in his
[00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:26.960]   labs, the students and the graduate students and so on, they said that he basically encouraged
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:28.400]   people to get good results.
[00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:33.280]   And in that process and in that way, there was some fuzziness in the data or some tweaking
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:36.160]   of the data that he didn't double check for sure.
[00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:41.440]   But he was encouraging this sort of system of performance and the system of performance
[00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:43.040]   says you've got to show results.
[00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:44.640]   You can't show non results.
[00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:46.240]   And if you show non results, there's no money.
[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:48.880]   And the reason they're doing that is marketing.
[00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:53.600]   They want to market and get more attention so they get more donations.
[00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:54.320]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:59.040]   The problem with with pure research is that you have to get funding to do your research.
[00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:00.160]   Where do you get your funding from?
[00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:05.040]   You get your funding from federal agencies, from nonprofits, from your, you know, your
[00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:05.920]   donors.
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:09.280]   And so in order to get that money, you have to say, here's what I'm going to do.
[00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:12.480]   Here's not what here's, you don't say I'm going to go not prove something.
[00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:13.760]   You say I'm going to go prove something.
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:15.840]   You're hiding the cheese.
[00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:16.960]   Can you stop hiding the cheese?
[00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:18.240]   That's not what these people are saying.
[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:20.160]   These people aren't saying I'm not going to not prove this.
[00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:26.720]   These like most of these people are working on very thin incremental extensions of work
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:33.120]   that's already been done, because it allows them a more defined path to get tenureship
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:36.720]   to be a well respected professor to work through the hierarchy of a university.
[00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:37.920]   That's what's happening today.
[00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:42.160]   And the reason why that stuff gets funded is that those are the same people that are
[00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:45.520]   in charge of the funding infrastructure at NIH and all these other places.
[00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:51.520]   What we don't have is something that says, go and write the most ambitious proposals,
[00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:52.560]   and I'm going to go fund it.
[00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:53.760]   I think both things are true.
[00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:54.320]   I'm sorry.
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:55.840]   There's no market mechanism.
[00:37:55.840 --> 00:38:00.080]   I'll just say both things are true, because what you're saying, Chamath, is a point of
[00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:00.880]   failure.
[00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:04.960]   If you say I'm going to go try something crazy, like do a search for a room temperature
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:08.720]   superconductor using lead crystals, you're not going to get funding for that.
[00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:10.000]   It's too out there.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.760]   I mean, you guys today are talking about how low probability stuff isn't that interesting.
[00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:15.520]   I'm not going to fund it until it's real.
[00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:20.240]   And so when things are real, you have some molecule that has some effect on cancer cells,
[00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:24.960]   then you get funding to make that molecule go to the next phase or go to the next stage.
[00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:28.880]   That is more fundable than the outlandish crazy thing where the probability of it going
[00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:30.000]   to zero is 99%.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.560]   You could throw Elizabeth Holmes into that, right?
[00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:36.800]   I mean, she came up with this absurd idea that she could do 200 tests on one drop of
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:39.360]   blood, and they left her out of campus.
[00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:41.840]   That was just a statement about engineering that wasn't ready.
[00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:45.680]   And what another company just got funded to do the same thing that Theranos promises going
[00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:46.320]   to do.
[00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:48.880]   Yeah, you see this, but I did not say that.
[00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:54.320]   Yeah, I mean, some pretty good VCs invested in actually, and they especially said, we
[00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:55.920]   know this is the same idea as Theranos.
[00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:59.760]   But for that very reason, we think it's very unlikely to be fraud because it's being held
[00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:01.600]   to such a high standard of scrutiny.
[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:03.200]   I want you guys to think about this.
[00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:05.120]   I want you guys to think about this as VCs.
[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:07.440]   An entrepreneur comes to you.
[00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:09.840]   And the entrepreneur, she says, I've done this thing.
[00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:10.480]   I did this thing.
[00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:11.040]   I did this thing.
[00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:11.440]   I did this thing.
[00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:13.360]   I did this thing, five different things, none of them work.
[00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:15.760]   I want to have money to do this next thing.
[00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:20.160]   You're less likely to fund that person than the entrepreneur that shows up and says, this
[00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:21.120]   first thing I did work.
[00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:23.520]   The second thing I did work, the third startup I did work.
[00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:26.480]   They weren't home runs, but they were amazing.
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:27.440]   And I had good results.
[00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:32.400]   That's basically what happens in, you know, the scientific research is you've got to get
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:33.760]   something that's fundable.
[00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:37.120]   And often that means not doing something that's likely to go to zero.
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:40.400]   And that's where the incrementalism comes in, Chamath, is that orientation, I think.
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:44.720]   I hate to give my playbook, but one of the great successes I've had is finding people
[00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:48.720]   who got their asses kicked on the last two companies, talking to them about why they
[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:52.560]   got their asses kicked, and then how they're going to avoid getting their asses handed
[00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:53.840]   to them with this third company.
[00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:59.680]   Then if you look at Travis with Uber, he did Scour, got, you know, sued for a quarter trillion
[00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:00.320]   dollars.
[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:01.760]   He did Red Swoosh.
[00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:04.000]   He got like a $30 million exit.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:04.960]   And then he did Uber, right?
[00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:07.200]   He, his first two companies were very hard.
[00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:11.760]   Steve Jervison and Future Ventures, he took his venture fund and he told the LPs, it's
[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:13.520]   a 15 year term, not 10.
[00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:17.840]   So he specifically is trying to do a little bit of a longer window.
[00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:20.080]   I think that is actually a possible solution here.
[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:22.800]   I think smart, independent thinkers find ways to make money.
[00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:28.080]   I've been looking at this superconductor space for the last two years.
[00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:32.960]   And so it's not like people are shy and have money and aren't willing to write the checks.
[00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:34.560]   I just don't think that's what it is.
[00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:38.480]   The body of work that's coming out of academic institutions today for the amount of money
[00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:40.240]   that's put in is modest.
[00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:41.920]   And I think that's the best way to describe it.
[00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:43.040]   It's the fairest way.
[00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:47.120]   And the reason it's modest is not because of the intellectual capacity of the people.
[00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:54.240]   It's because of the incentives and the hierarchy and the establishment elitist politics that
[00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:56.800]   infuses how these organizations are run.
[00:40:56.800 --> 00:41:03.200]   And I think the only way to break that apart is to basically disrupt who is in charge of
[00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:04.000]   these institutions.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.120]   Nick, just throw up this chart.
[00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:13.600]   These are people that for decades and decades and decades are in a grind and who are now
[00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:14.640]   in control.
[00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:18.480]   And so what is the incentive of these folks to change?
[00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:19.520]   Explain the chart.
[00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:20.400]   Yeah, what is this?
[00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:24.320]   This is a chart that I put together, which is just the generational distribution of academic
[00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:27.280]   leadership across all the leading research institutions in America.
[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:28.800]   Okay?
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:31.360]   Well, isn't Fauci a prime example of this?
[00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:32.560]   This is the birth year?
[00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:37.360]   No, listen, you had the most important person, hold on a second, the most important person
[00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:42.800]   probably in the federal distribution of grants in the medical field was Fauci, right?
[00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:45.760]   He literally was running the NIH since the 1980s.
[00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:48.560]   He's been there for 40-something years.
[00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:50.960]   And the mask was peeled away during COVID.
[00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:55.120]   And we saw how much power he wielded, really, I think, in a corrupt way.
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:56.640]   Jason used the word corrupt.
[00:41:56.640 --> 00:42:02.720]   You had that letter to the Lancet that he got a whole bunch of scientists to sign that
[00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:08.480]   claimed that COVID was not made in a lab, that was a conspiracy theory, that the only
[00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:14.160]   place it could have come from was the sort of the zoonotic leap naturally occurring from
[00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:14.960]   animals.
[00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:20.320]   We know that he used his power over grants to basically pressure those people into signing
[00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:24.240]   the letter, or they thought it would be in their interest to do so.
[00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:28.800]   Even though Fauci had already been updated by a bunch of scientists that it likely had
[00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:32.720]   come from a lab, they could just look under a microscope and see it appearing in Cleveland
[00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:35.200]   sites, which are the telltale sign.
[00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:38.000]   So, they knew that this thing likely came from a lab.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   There was no basis for calling it a conspiracy theory, certainly.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.480]   And yet, the whole field got behind that.
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:48.800]   But Sax, did you see the Slack messages where they were trying to manipulate the New York
[00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:50.240]   Times science writer?
[00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:51.440]   I mean, they basically...
[00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:54.480]   But the question you have to ask is why were all these scientists willing to go along with
[00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:56.480]   this and sign that letter to the Lancet?
[00:42:56.480 --> 00:43:00.320]   Because these guys have been grinding for 40 or 50 years in a hierarchy.
[00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:03.840]   And so, to all of a sudden, put a pin in it and just say, you know what, I'm going to
[00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:05.360]   dispense with all of it.
[00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:08.240]   And now I'm going to basically like be completely open minded.
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:09.120]   How likely was that?
[00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:10.640]   The odds of that were very low.
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:16.400]   Look, look at the number of people who have basically grown up in one segment of society
[00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:21.600]   that are sclerotically in charge of every single leading research university in the
[00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:22.640]   United States.
[00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:24.960]   That is why we don't have flying cars.
[00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:26.640]   This is why.
[00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:31.520]   Because after 40 years of working in a specific hierarchy, being rewarded in a very specific
[00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:36.400]   way with a very specific set of incentives, when some young, brash, 22-year-old naive
[00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:41.280]   person writes an extremely ambitious research proposal, you're like, no, you will not be
[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:42.480]   a part of my lab to do that.
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:47.840]   But you can do this incremental thing that that further reinforces my leadership in society.
[00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:50.000]   That is what this chart shows.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   Yeah, it's also perverse inside of government.
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.840]   We didn't talk about it, I don't think, last week.
[00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:57.520]   But Mitch McConnell, I don't know how to say it, but I guess he froze while he was
[00:43:57.520 --> 00:43:58.000]   speaking.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.400]   And, you know, we got to have an upper age.
[00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:02.080]   Oh, and then the Dianne Feinstein thing.
[00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:07.280]   Remember when she started giving a speech and their staff are whispering, saying, just
[00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:11.360]   say I, you know, and she starts going on this like filibuster.
[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:12.880]   No, Jason, you're right.
[00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:17.840]   We have a sporadic political system run by octogenarians because the boomers are not
[00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:19.280]   relinquishing political power.
[00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:19.760]   They're fucking retired.
[00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:22.080]   And they're also not relinquishing bureaucratic power.
[00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:24.480]   Can we just pull up this Lancet letter for a second?
[00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:28.240]   They say here, zoom in on this, "The rapid, open, and transparent sharing of data on this
[00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:34.160]   outbreak is now being threatened by rumors and misinformation around its origins.
[00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:39.280]   We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not
[00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:40.400]   have a natural origin."
[00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:43.280]   How could they say that at that point in time?
[00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:46.320]   All the evidence suggested it was made in a lab.
[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:50.800]   Now, certainly, I think you could take the other side of that, but to condemn the lab
[00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:54.160]   leak theory as a conspiracy theory, that was corrupt.
[00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:55.280]   I'm not sure that that's corrupt.
[00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:57.840]   You know, what's corrupt is not retracting that and apologizing.
[00:44:57.840 --> 00:45:00.480]   That's where the real corruption is.
[00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:01.680]   We have not gotten our post-mortem on this stuff.
[00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:03.600]   But this Lancet letter was organized.
[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:04.560]   It was organized.
[00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:09.040]   This is just like the 51 spies who lied, claiming that the Hunter Biden laptop was
[00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:10.320]   disinformation.
[00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:18.560]   This is the establishment willing to use its credentials and respectability and expertise
[00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:24.560]   to sign a letter they know is false to perpetrate a fraud on the American people in order to
[00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:26.320]   protect the people in charge.
[00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:31.040]   That's the motivation here, because Fauci had funded gain-of-function research in the
[00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:31.760]   Wuhan lab.
[00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:36.640]   I think the same rot that is in some of these leading research institutions and leading
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:42.960]   academic institutions and politics, they all share the same commonality, which is we are
[00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:43.680]   sclerotic.
[00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:48.000]   We are in desperate need of a generational shift of power.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:53.280]   And right now, there is no incentive, because at the same time, you know, the people that
[00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:56.320]   are 70 and 80 are thinking to themselves, "Well, I'm probably going to live to 100.
[00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:58.240]   What should I do for the next 20 years?"
[00:45:58.240 --> 00:45:59.600]   Being in power is pretty good.
[00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:01.120]   Right?
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:03.040]   So we're in this weird clash.
[00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:09.200]   I was thinking a lot about the fiscal spending problem in the US, and we should talk about
[00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:11.040]   the Fitch rating downgrade that happened this week.
[00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:13.280]   I've got some data I'd like to share.
[00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:20.240]   One thing I was thinking about was how tied the age of Congress is to our fiscal spending
[00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:21.040]   problem.
[00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:26.000]   If you think about someone who's young, they're going to want to invest for their future and
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:26.960]   think about the future.
[00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:32.080]   If you're someone who's old, you live for the day, and you don't think about the future.
[00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:37.440]   And I worry so much that the aging of the establishment that makes the decisions about
[00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:43.760]   how money is spent creates a psychological barrier or positioning that's all about giving
[00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:48.880]   away all the money today instead of making the right decision to make sure that we have
[00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:50.160]   a prosperous tomorrow.
[00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:55.360]   And that's why I think so many of these things kind of slip through.
[00:46:55.360 --> 00:47:00.960]   If you put a 20-year-old in charge that was well-informed in charge of some of the fiscal
[00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:06.480]   policy, environmental policy, energy policy decisions, defense policy, it would be a very
[00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:09.760]   different set of decision making than someone who's in their 80s.
[00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:10.720]   Inheritance tax.
[00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:12.560]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:15.520]   I mean, so anyway, we should talk about you want to talk about the Fitch downgrade because
[00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:17.680]   I think it's a really important story this week.
[00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:25.600]   Fitch, the rating agency downgraded the US's long term debt by one notch from AAA to AA+.
[00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:31.360]   Only nine countries have AAA ratings from the top three rating agencies, S&P, Global,
[00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:32.480]   Fitch, and Moody's.
[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:37.120]   Those are Germany, Denmark, Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Switzerland, Luxembourg,
[00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:38.000]   Singapore, and Australia.
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:41.520]   What you can take from that is you got to have a good balance sheet and you have to
[00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:43.920]   have high functioning governments.
[00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:47.600]   The highest functioning governments in the world are the Nordics.
[00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:50.240]   That's why you see Denmark, Netherlands, Sweden, Norway there.
[00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:55.120]   According to NPR, the negative reaction hasn't been as strong as 2011.
[00:47:55.120 --> 00:48:00.000]   That was the first time the US was downgraded from AAA to AA+ by the S&P.
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:01.840]   That also had to do with the debt ceiling.
[00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:05.760]   The markets kind of shrugged off, largely shrugged off the Fitch downgrade.
[00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:12.560]   Main reasons for the downgrade is obviously higher interest rates, aging population,
[00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:15.280]   the debt to GDP ratio, which we've talked about here.
[00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:21.120]   But government kept coming up over and over again and how dysfunctional our government
[00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:25.360]   is and the debt ceiling is one of the key manifestations of that.
[00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:27.200]   Your thoughts on this?
[00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:32.960]   For the first half of the show, Freeberg, you're an optimist, but are you now going
[00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:34.640]   to switch to declinist?
[00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:35.840]   I wouldn't say declinist.
[00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:39.440]   Are you going to switch to declinist mode now or are you still in optimist mode?
[00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:44.000]   I mean, in Jekyll's view, unless you're a cheerleader for every stupid government policy,
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:45.280]   you're a declinist.
[00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:46.320]   I know.
[00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:50.320]   Jekyll, listen, I want to be honest.
[00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:51.120]   I don't think so.
[00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:57.280]   I think he, like, and I concur, I think you can highlight that there are concerns with
[00:48:57.280 --> 00:49:03.920]   US fiscal policy that are putting us in decline in our spending spiral with the US currency
[00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:07.120]   reserves, which there are now diversification efforts underway, and I'll talk about this
[00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:07.760]   in one second.
[00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:12.720]   And that doesn't mean that the US isn't the most exceptional place to do engineering
[00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:16.320]   and entrepreneurism and have freedom of speech and thought and so on.
[00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:18.560]   But there are elements of the US that put things at risk.
[00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:20.240]   So let me just point out these two charts.
[00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:24.160]   If you guys pull the first one up, this is a pretty striking chart, and I think I showed
[00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:24.880]   this before.
[00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:27.920]   This is federal government interest payments that are being made.
[00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:30.560]   We're now up to, you know, a trillion dollars.
[00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:33.760]   The chart, as you can see, a year, has spiked.
[00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:37.280]   And by the way, that number is spiking further, and we'll talk about this in one second, as
[00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:40.400]   a result of rising interest rates and increased fiscal spending.
[00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:42.880]   So this is now becoming a pretty sizable part of our budget.
[00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:48.560]   And as of now, paying the interest on our debt is a larger capital outlay for the federal
[00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:49.840]   government than defense spending.
[00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:54.160]   The second chart shows what happened in the last week, which is that 30 year treasuries
[00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:55.440]   have been sold off.
[00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:57.920]   And as that's happened, treasury yields have climbed.
[00:49:57.920 --> 00:50:03.520]   So there's been about a 10% decline in pricing and, you know, concurrent, nearly 10% increase.
[00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:07.520]   And Bill Ackman, you know, basically said today that he's shorting 30 year treasuries,
[00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:10.640]   he thinks we're going to go to 5.5% long term rates.
[00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:12.960]   Currently, the 30 year treasury sitting at 4.3.
[00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:18.560]   And remember, I told you guys this after this thing I went to a few weeks ago, that there
[00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:23.440]   were two prominent economists who shared that they think we're going to be facing long term
[00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:28.320]   rates in the 5 to 7% range, very long term rates for a very long period of time, that
[00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:30.400]   it is a new fiscal regime.
[00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:35.840]   And then if you pull up the last link I sent Nick, this is a report made by the Treasury
[00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:39.120]   Borrowing Advisory Committee of the Treasury Department.
[00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:41.360]   And I just want to read a couple of quotes from this report.
[00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:45.440]   This just came out today, and it was published, it was sent over to the Secretary of the Treasury
[00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:46.240]   yesterday.
[00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:51.280]   And it said since the advisory committee convened in May, two year treasury yields are about
[00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:54.800]   100 basis points higher, while 10 year treasuries have increased by about 40 basis points.
[00:50:54.800 --> 00:51:00.480]   The bank holdings of non mortgage backed government securities, mainly treasuries, have actually
[00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:04.000]   declined by 146 billion so far this year.
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:06.160]   That means banks are selling off their treasuries.
[00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:10.480]   The committee goes on to say at the same time, treasury investors have noted the treasury
[00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:16.000]   supply will need to increase to address the rise in public deficits, as tax revenues have
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.880]   come in weaker, and government spending has increased.
[00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:22.720]   Issuance needs will be additionally impacted by the timing of a recession, so on.
[00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:27.680]   Then they said, based on the marketable borrowing estimates published on July 31st, treasury,
[00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:33.680]   this is crazy, treasury currently expects privately held net borrowing of
[00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:41.120]   $1.007 trillion in this quarter, with an assumed end of September cash balance of 650.
[00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:47.520]   And then they said we expect another $852 billion of borrowing next quarter.
[00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:53.440]   That means treasury is going to try and issue and sell $2 trillion worth of treasury bonds
[00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:55.440]   in the next two quarters.
[00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:59.600]   That's $2 trillion of new borrowing by the federal government to pay our bills.
[00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:04.240]   At the start of the year, they were estimating $1.6 trillion for the year, which was an insane
[00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:04.800]   number.
[00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:06.880]   Now we're talking about $2 trillion in just two quarters.
[00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:09.120]   So rates are climbing.
[00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:11.040]   As a result, we need to borrow more.
[00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:15.200]   And this is a perfect manifestation of the debt spiral problem that we've talked about
[00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:16.400]   multiple times.
[00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:22.320]   Our fiscal spending outlay and the rising interest rates combine to create an insurmountable
[00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:28.800]   debt spiral that is now manifesting in the fact that we need to sell $2 trillion of treasuries.
[00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:30.880]   And here's the crazy statistic that they said.
[00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:36.880]   In reviewing recent demand for US treasuries in auctions, the committee noted that an increasing
[00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:41.120]   percentage of supply is being absorbed by investment funds, while foreign participation
[00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:42.240]   has remained range bound.
[00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:46.800]   That means as we're trying to sell more treasuries, foreign governments are buying fewer of them,
[00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:50.960]   which means that the US currency as a reserve is no longer the place that everyone wants
[00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:52.960]   to plow their money as much as it used to be.
[00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:54.240]   It is in decline.
[00:52:54.960 --> 00:53:00.080]   Now, the other thing I want to share, which I think is absolutely critical, is how do
[00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:01.440]   we address this gap?
[00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:03.600]   Well, the one way is these entitlement programs.
[00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:08.480]   And so several Republican presidential candidates, Nikki Haley, Ron DeSantis, and Mike Pence,
[00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:14.320]   have all publicly stated on the campaign trail that they're promoting programs to cut Social
[00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:17.920]   Security benefits for people that are 30 and 40 years old.
[00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:19.680]   And here's the response to that.
[00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:22.480]   So they've gone out and they've started saying that.
[00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:25.040]   A poll was done.
[00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:32.400]   And on that poll, 82% of voters opposed the push to cut Social Security for Americans
[00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:33.120]   under 50.
[00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:33.680]   82%.
[00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:36.640]   So where is this going to take us?
[00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:38.800]   This is what is so scary to me, J. Cal.
[00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:40.480]   I'm not an American declinist.
[00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:42.320]   I believe in the American system.
[00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:44.160]   It benefited me and my family.
[00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:48.640]   But I do worry that we find ourselves in a whirlpool that is very hard to get out of
[00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:53.040]   because the populace says we don't want to make the cuts that are necessary in order
[00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:54.400]   for us to save ourselves.
[00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:56.000]   That's what's so scary to me.
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.240]   And I said it before, I think it's worth saying again, that's it.
[00:53:58.240 --> 00:53:59.520]   I'm done.
[00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:00.960]   It's not a problem with populism.
[00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:02.720]   I mean, the elites are saying it too.
[00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:06.640]   There's no appetite in the DNC to cut or reform Social Security.
[00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:07.200]   Are you kidding?
[00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:08.080]   It's very unpopular.
[00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:09.440]   How do you get elected saying?
[00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:10.480]   I don't know why those Republicans...
[00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:11.760]   How do you get elected saying?
[00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:13.280]   I hadn't seen that article.
[00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:15.920]   I would advise all those campaigns not to touch that rail.
[00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:17.200]   They're going to electrocute themselves.
[00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:22.720]   I think Trump has the right political instincts on this point, which is you cannot touch
[00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:25.760]   Social Security as a single party effort.
[00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:27.200]   It has to be bipartisan.
[00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:29.200]   And there is no bipartisan will to do anything.
[00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:31.200]   So I think you're right about the larger point.
[00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:38.560]   Chamath, your thoughts on Friedberg's manifesto that 80% of the public does not want to cut
[00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:38.880]   spending.
[00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:42.560]   They're in favor of Social Security for people under 50 years old.
[00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:44.320]   And we have a trillion dollars in debt payments.
[00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:46.160]   And we're in a death spiral because we don't have the will.
[00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:47.440]   And we're borrowing $2 trillion.
[00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:49.520]   In 180 days, we're borrowing an extra $2 trillion.
[00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:50.960]   That's the real point.
[00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:54.080]   The fiscal end of days.
[00:54:54.080 --> 00:54:59.440]   At the start of the year, the expectation was they were only going to borrow $1.6 trillion
[00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:00.480]   for the year.
[00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:02.640]   Now we're borrowing $2 trillion and just these two quarters.
[00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:04.640]   Let me just state what I think about the downgrade.
[00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:05.360]   It's irrelevant.
[00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:09.120]   The S&P did it 13 years ago.
[00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:12.000]   Fitch is a marginal credit rating agency.
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:14.400]   They're at a minimum 13 years late.
[00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:18.320]   At a maximum, they're just anxiety ridden, like other people are.
[00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:20.640]   We're always screaming that the sky is falling.
[00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:21.760]   So that's my first point.
[00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:28.000]   The second point and the more important one is that none of you who are always freaking
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:32.720]   out about this understand this conversation about relativism.
[00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:35.040]   All of these conversations are relative.
[00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:36.480]   They can deal with them in absolutes.
[00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:42.080]   On a relative basis, Japan's debt to GDP is 270% and growing.
[00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:44.960]   On a relative basis, our debt to GDP is half of that.
[00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:50.240]   We are the most important economic force in the world.
[00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:54.080]   It is going to continue to be the most economic force in the world.
[00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:59.120]   All I see actually on every single monetary basis is every other country struggling more
[00:55:59.120 --> 00:55:59.680]   than we are.
[00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:06.560]   So my question to all of the chicken littles is, what do you do if you're a central government
[00:56:06.560 --> 00:56:09.360]   where you have to have foreign reserves?
[00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:13.520]   Do you all of a sudden double down on the euro?
[00:56:13.520 --> 00:56:18.320]   Do you double down on the yuan, which is basically a proxy for doubling down on the US dollar?
[00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:20.240]   What are you supposed to do?
[00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:24.160]   And I never get a good answer because on a relative basis, the US will still continue
[00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:24.720]   to do well.
[00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:28.880]   I think that debt to GDP is a red herring for a lot of people.
[00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:34.400]   And I think that the way that people run their personal lives, which should take income to
[00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:38.880]   debt into consideration, I don't think applies as much to governments.
[00:56:38.880 --> 00:56:42.000]   And I think these things are going to march forward as a group.
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:47.200]   There's not going to be a single G8 country that all of a sudden moves away and starts
[00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:48.720]   printing surpluses.
[00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:52.560]   It happened almost as an accident and an aberration during the Clinton administration.
[00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:53.520]   It'll never happen again.
[00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:59.680]   And I think that we shouldn't worry so much, because I just don't see an alternative.
[00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:03.680]   So give me instead of telling me how bad this is, because you think about your own life
[00:57:03.680 --> 00:57:06.320]   and how it would be bad if you had debt to GDP of 100.
[00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:06.800]   I get it.
[00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:10.320]   As a country, give me the alternative country.
[00:57:10.320 --> 00:57:11.760]   But just start with that.
[00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:12.800]   Can you answer that question?
[00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:14.960]   What is the alternative country?
[00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:18.240]   Yeah, where would you put your, your wealth, if not the dollar?
[00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:25.600]   Well, let me paint a scenario that's not as dire as a collapse of the US dollars, the
[00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:26.960]   world's reserve currency.
[00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:30.400]   Okay, so on this Fitch, that's not what I think happens, right?
[00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:32.400]   I think this is just purchasing power goes down.
[00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:32.960]   That's it.
[00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:34.640]   But go ahead, sex relative to who?
[00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:36.320]   Be specific.
[00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:36.720]   Anyone.
[00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:39.600]   But what does that what does that mean relative to anyone?
[00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:44.240]   Let me paint like a non catastrophic scenario or non apocalyptic scenario, which is what
[00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:49.760]   you saw in this Fitch ratings downgrade is that the bond market didn't move at the margins,
[00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:51.440]   there was a sell off in the 10 year.
[00:57:51.440 --> 00:57:54.800]   And as a result, the 10 year bond yield moved up to 4.2%.
[00:57:54.800 --> 00:58:00.000]   So it wasn't a case of everybody shedding all of their US treasuries.
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:05.520]   It's just that there were market actors at the margins who adjusted their portfolios.
[00:58:05.520 --> 00:58:10.080]   Okay, now, Freeburg is saying that the Treasury is going to have to do another $2 trillion
[00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:14.160]   bond offering, and we have trillion dollar plus deficits as far as the eye can see.
[00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:19.680]   And we've got entitlement liabilities on the horizon and then a political unwillingness
[00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:20.960]   to do anything about it.
[00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:23.200]   So the deficits are only going to get bigger and bigger.
[00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:24.160]   Now, what does that do?
[00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:25.680]   It's supply and demand.
[00:58:25.680 --> 00:58:30.400]   When the US Treasury needs to keep issuing more and more bonds, at some point, the demand
[00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:35.920]   for those things gets incrementally saturated, and they have to offer a higher yield.
[00:58:35.920 --> 00:58:37.440]   So what happens?
[00:58:37.440 --> 00:58:39.280]   Well, the bond rates go up.
[00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:43.760]   And so the 10 year goes up, like Freeburg was saying, from 4.2% to somewhere in the
[00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:45.520]   5% to 7% range.
[00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:48.880]   And that doesn't mean that US dollar is not the world's reserve currency.
[00:58:48.880 --> 00:58:54.320]   It just means that it gets incrementally harder and more expensive to keep financing our debt.
[00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:55.760]   Now, what is the result of that?
[00:58:55.760 --> 00:59:02.560]   Well, if I, as an investor, could theoretically get 7% from the US Treasury as the risk free
[00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:07.280]   rate, why would I want to take equity risk and put it in the stock market, which historically
[00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:09.440]   has yielded somewhere in the 5% to 7% range?
[00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:15.280]   So if I can get my 5% to 7% from a risk-free US government bond, of course, I'm going to
[00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:16.080]   do that.
[00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:19.120]   So the discount rate on equities will go up.
[00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:23.600]   That means that the stock market, on a relative basis, will go down.
[00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:24.640]   Risk capital will go down.
[00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:26.000]   There will be less risk capital.
[00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:30.480]   And there'll be way less risk capital available for things like venture capital and private
[00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:32.480]   equity, just risk taking of all kinds.
[00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:34.960]   And so the economy will just grow slower.
[00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:36.320]   It's not like there'll be a collapse.
[00:59:36.320 --> 00:59:41.280]   It'll just be this huge albatross around the neck of the private sector.
[00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:42.560]   And this is called crowding out.
[00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:43.920]   Here's the thing.
[00:59:43.920 --> 00:59:44.880]   May I give a counter here?
[00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:50.000]   I think if you look at the amount of sovereign wealth funds and the investment coming from
[00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:55.360]   around the world into US venture capital, that will keep the venture machine cranking
[00:59:55.360 --> 00:59:56.160]   here in America.
[00:59:56.160 --> 00:59:57.840]   But three charts to just look at here.
[00:59:57.840 --> 01:00:00.080]   Nick, pull up the first one, the 30-year Fed.
[01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:08.480]   So to counter this argument, really, the aberration has been 2010 to 2020 when we had low single
[01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:10.560]   digit mortgages, 3%, 4%.
[01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:13.840]   The majority of our lifetime, it was between 5 and 10.
[01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:18.640]   And if it's 6 up in the 5 to 10 basis, that's what we experienced for most of our life.
[01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:23.040]   And then the second chart, this is the lowest unemployment we've had in our lifetimes.
[01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:28.000]   If you look at the unemployment rate in the United States, 3.6 is unbelievable.
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.880]   And then combined with it, something we've talked about here for two years that we can't
[01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:33.520]   understand is when do all these jobs burn off?
[01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:38.960]   We peaked during the post-COVID era at about 11 million job openings.
[01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:41.280]   And then we're still over nine.
[01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:45.760]   So there's two or three job openings for every American who wants to work.
[01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:49.440]   And we've shut down the borders largely, even though we have some illegal immigration coming
[01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:50.000]   in.
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.640]   It has basically shut down the United States to immigration.
[01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:57.200]   It's about a third of what it was before Trump and Biden decided to shut things down.
[01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:00.240]   I don't think we're looking at the same video that I'm seeing.
[01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:02.320]   Yeah, if you're looking at videos, those are very distracting.
[01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:05.840]   I would encourage you to look at the numbers of the actual migration into the country.
[01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:07.120]   It's a third of what it was.
[01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:08.800]   Just seeing what's happening in New York City.
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:10.400]   They got lines around the blocks.
[01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:13.440]   You're caught up in clips from the border.
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:16.000]   I would just look at the raw numbers, Sax, and the raw numbers show you're already-
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.120]   How do they know the raw numbers?
[01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:19.040]   Yeah, because we count them.
[01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:19.920]   And we count the immigration.
[01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:22.000]   Well, you have to estimate them because they're illegal.
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.120]   But they got 7 million in the last two and a half years.
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:27.760]   Again, I would much rather look at the numbers and the actual statistics than anecdotal videos
[01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:31.360]   because both sides will manipulate the heck out of them for their own purposes.
[01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:34.800]   But the fact is, America is just crushing it in terms of employment.
[01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:37.680]   And that's why we didn't have this crash landing.
[01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:40.800]   And I think the soft landing is because of employment.
[01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:42.160]   And I'll just end there.
[01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:47.280]   And if we can keep ourselves employed, and everybody from the Middle East to Japan,
[01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:52.400]   to high net worth individuals in Europe are pouring their money into the US venture ecosystem,
[01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:55.200]   I think the setup here is we got to control spending.
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:58.560]   As you've said correctly, Friedberg, we get a little bit of control on spending,
[01:01:58.560 --> 01:01:59.120]   hopefully.
[01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:04.240]   And then we are going to have to slowly burn off some of this debt.
[01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:06.640]   We can't live with this kind of debt payments.
[01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:08.400]   Here's a little data for you, Chamath.
[01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:11.440]   This is from Congressional Research Service off of Fed data.
[01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:18.000]   So foreign holdings of US treasuries have declined from 40% to 30% of total treasuries.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:21.600]   70% of treasuries today are held by domestic investors.
[01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:26.800]   This is the data that was being described in the Treasury Advisory Committee.
[01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:31.120]   The Borrowing Advisory Committee letter that I just said is that they're seeing less demand
[01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:32.560]   from foreign buyers of treasuries.
[01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:35.840]   Now, I can argue, we can argue theoretically about what else are they going to buy?
[01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:36.880]   What else are they doing with their money?
[01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:37.840]   I don't know.
[01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:44.560]   But the data is showing a decline in purchasing intention by foreign buyers of US treasuries.
[01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:48.080]   And we're having to pick up the slack through investment funds held by the US,
[01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:52.400]   mostly pension, mostly retirement funds, I would guess that are buying these treasuries.
[01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:54.080]   That is not what this chart shows.
[01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:56.640]   The chart shows the effect of quantitative easing.
[01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:57.840]   That's what this chart shows.
[01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:01.360]   Because when you're buying treasuries from the market and retiring them,
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:05.280]   of course, the percentage of foreign and domestic holdings of publicly held debt is going to go down.
[01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:09.600]   So this last period, explain this x of QE, explain it.
[01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:11.120]   Sorry, I don't understand what you're saying.
[01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:15.040]   This is a measurement of the amount of people that own treasuries.
[01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:15.840]   Is that right?
[01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:17.520]   Domestic versus foreign?
[01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:21.920]   Yeah, so who owns so as of December 22, there was 20.
[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:23.040]   Domestic holdings.
[01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:25.520]   I'm going to assume because this chart is fucking worthless.
[01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:30.240]   If this if it doesn't assume that the domestic holding the gray bar that adds up to 100
[01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:32.800]   doesn't include the Fed, which it must.
[01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:37.200]   And that is because the Fed has been buying treasuries from the market.
[01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:39.280]   Okay, so just let me just give you the numbers for a second.
[01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:41.440]   And then we can take out.
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:42.560]   I'm just looking at the chart.
[01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:45.360]   The chart is a gray bar that says domestic holdings.
[01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:48.080]   I'm gonna give you there's an orange bar that says foreign holdings.
[01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:53.280]   You've had 10 years of the Fed buying treasuries.
[01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:54.720]   I'm going to give you the numbers.
[01:03:54.720 --> 01:04:03.200]   There are $24 trillion of treasuries publicly held treasuries outstanding 7.4 trillion held
[01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:10.480]   in foreign hands, the foreign holding of publicly held debt between December of 18 and December 22
[01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:13.120]   increased from 6.3 trillion to 7.4 trillion.
[01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:18.400]   While other investors increased from 16 trillion to probably 23 trillion.
[01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:22.480]   So you know, it's we're having to pick up the slack investment funds, private investors
[01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:26.720]   are having to pick up the slack because of foreign demand for treasuries lagging at this
[01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:27.280]   point.
[01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:28.480]   That's the point of the chart.
[01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:29.840]   I don't know what I don't know what to tell you.
[01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:34.160]   I think what this chart shows me is that the balance sheet of domestic holdings grows grows
[01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:37.360]   because the Fed has been buying treasuries and in a in a world of Qt.
[01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:41.440]   I suspect that this bar chart will change in the next 10 years.
[01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:45.360]   If you look at the histogram 10 years from now, if you assume the Qt sticks around, so
[01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:49.440]   I don't know you can interpret whatever you want to feed your anxiety, it doesn't change
[01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:54.400]   that there's a relative problem at hand, which is you cannot sell one thing without buying
[01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:54.720]   another.
[01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:57.440]   That's just the way it works in financial markets.
[01:04:57.440 --> 01:05:02.400]   The Federal Reserve during that same time period increase their treasury holdings.
[01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:06.800]   Here's the exact numbers from nine 3.7 trillion to 9.7 trillion.
[01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:08.400]   So they bought 6 trillion of that debt.
[01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:12.080]   I think the fact that we're going to go from quantitative easing to quantitative tightening
[01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:13.840]   over the next decade is another overhang.
[01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:18.240]   But because not the whole thing, because not only does the US government need to sell another
[01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:24.480]   2 trillion of bonds every year to finance its deficit, which is basically the addition
[01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:25.440]   to the debt.
[01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:28.880]   You've got the Fed now shedding what like 8 trillion.
[01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:32.800]   They're just letting them roll off.
[01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:34.720]   They're letting them roll off and they're not reissuing them.
[01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:39.840]   But you actually said the right thing earlier, which is that the risk premium has been shrunk
[01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:41.600]   so massively between equities and bonds.
[01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:48.800]   These 2 trillion of bonds that these guys will issue bet between the strip trade from
[01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:54.160]   5% all the way down to there'll be a line out the door, I guarantee you.
[01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:57.920]   And the reason why is exactly what you said before, David, which is like, why not own
[01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:02.640]   5% paper from the US government versus having to like all of a sudden speculate on the S&P
[01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:03.600]   500 or something else?
[01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:04.320]   It's a no brainer.
[01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:05.600]   And I totally agree with you.
[01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:09.120]   But that this last 2 trillion, that'll be the easiest 2 trillion to sell.
[01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:11.840]   There will be a line out the door, guaranteed.
[01:06:11.840 --> 01:06:14.480]   Well, there's a line out the door at some price.
[01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:19.600]   So my point is that the yield will have to go up to attract those incremental buyers.
[01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:25.360]   And as the supply of T-bills becomes a glut, obviously, they're gonna have to make the
[01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:30.160]   yield more attractive in order to keep attracting that marginal buyer.
[01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:31.920]   It's just that simple.
[01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:34.640]   So yeah, at some price, they'll be able to find a buyer.
[01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:38.160]   But that yield will have to get higher and higher over time.
[01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:40.320]   And then that crowds our private investment.
[01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:44.400]   Because why in the world would you invest in a risky stock when you get 7% risk free?
[01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:45.360]   What's your alternative?
[01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:49.600]   Because again, like, what do you think the spread to JGBs is going to be if that's true?
[01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:53.680]   If US treasuries, okay, if 30 year treasuries are all of a sudden, five and a half of Bill
[01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:56.560]   Ackman's, right, which you could very well be the other part of what he's not saying
[01:06:56.560 --> 01:06:58.960]   is what a JGBs look like, what do European bonds look like?
[01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:00.080]   You know what they're going to be?
[01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:04.800]   They're going to be trading at 300 to 500 basis points above that.
[01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:07.920]   It is cataclysmic for the entire world economy.
[01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:10.000]   And so we all move in unison.
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.720]   When we suffer, we will suffer less than other countries.
[01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:16.320]   And when we win, we will generally win more than other countries that has typically been
[01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:17.040]   true.
[01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:18.880]   I suspect it will typically be true.
[01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:20.800]   And I don't see anything changing that.
[01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:22.080]   Well, hold on, let's assume that you're right.
[01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:25.840]   And what happens is that the let's call it the Western world and all these governments
[01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:28.560]   are basically mired in debts with a few exceptions.
[01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:33.280]   I guess Australia is good, Switzerland is good, but the rest have massive debt to GDP
[01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:34.080]   as well.
[01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:36.320]   So their bonds have to move up with ours.
[01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:39.840]   And so their risk premium has to go up as well.
[01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:41.760]   So you're right in lockstep with the US.
[01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:47.600]   But now why wouldn't global growth just slow down across let's call it this whole Western
[01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:51.840]   dollar complex, coupled with inflation, coupled with inflation, right?
[01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:52.800]   Which is inevitable.
[01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:56.400]   That's basically what's happened in Japan, right, is that they have like a 200% debt
[01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:59.840]   to GDP, and they've been very active in yield curve control.
[01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:03.840]   And so they've controlled the interest rates, but the price of that's been total
[01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:06.880]   economic stagflation for two decades.
[01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:08.560]   They have demographic problems as well, but...
[01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:10.720]   That's the main issue there is young people there.
[01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:12.320]   There's just not a lot of young people there.
[01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:16.240]   I mean, housing is crazy if you just look at it.
[01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:18.960]   And I think the United States has a lot of innovation.
[01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:23.840]   So we will innovate our way out of it is my belief, which is kind of what we've always
[01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:23.840]   done.
[01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:27.680]   It's so exciting, guys, we can have this conversation with Larry Summers himself at
[01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:29.680]   the All In Summit in September.
[01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:31.760]   Wait, do we have Ray Dalio too?
[01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:32.960]   We have Ray Dalio, yeah.
[01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:34.160]   Are they going to be on a panel together?
[01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:36.560]   Or it'd be really interesting to discuss this topic with the two of them.
[01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:37.200]   Maybe overlap?
[01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:38.240]   I'll look at the schedule.
[01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:42.160]   Everyone, unfortunately, all our speakers are on tight schedules on when they're in
[01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:47.840]   and out, which is why I need Jekyll to respond to my IM to him about finalizing some of our
[01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:48.560]   other speakers.
[01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:49.280]   But...
[01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:53.040]   Hey, Jimmy texted me because apparently he's in London or he has to go to London right
[01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:53.200]   after.
[01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:54.080]   We gotta figure out how to get him back.
[01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:55.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:57.280]   He said he'd fly out, but we gotta figure out how to do that.
[01:08:57.280 --> 01:09:00.240]   But yeah, we can have this conversation in LA, September 10 through 12.
[01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:01.840]   Oh, well, it's sold out.
[01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:03.680]   So way to frustrate everybody.
[01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:09.200]   I'm getting like all kinds of like LPs and giant folks who are like, can I buy a VIP
[01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:09.520]   ticket?
[01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:10.640]   And I'm like, listen, it's sold out.
[01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:12.000]   You had two months to do that.
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:21.600]   So in other news, the GOP's lead candidate for the 2024 race, Donald Trump has been
[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:27.280]   indicted for trying to overturn the 2020 election and stop the peaceful transfer of
[01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:27.680]   power.
[01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:33.040]   The indictment has four counts and is the third criminal case for those of you playing
[01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:33.760]   along at home.
[01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:38.640]   Four counts include conspiracy to defraud the US, conspiracy to obstruct an official
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:43.760]   proceeding, obstruction of an attempt to obstruct an official proceeding, conspiracy against
[01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:46.160]   rights.
[01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:49.360]   Trump campaign not shockingly called it fake news.
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.800]   The indictment feels like it's got them dead to rights.
[01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:59.360]   And this is on top of the oath keepers, founders, Stuart Rhodes getting 18 years and a
[01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:00.800]   bunch of other cases.
[01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:06.560]   In addition to that, the DOJ prosecutors also accused Trump of ordering employees to delete
[01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:11.680]   security videos and the classified documents case, the coverup, of course, being worse
[01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:12.400]   than the crime.
[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:15.760]   Looks like they got them dead to rights on that one as well.
[01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:22.080]   All of this against the backdrop of DeSantis spending tens of millions of dollars and falling
[01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:24.320]   in his percentage.
[01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:30.320]   Sachs, explain to the audience why this is Hunter Biden's fault and that's a deep state
[01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:30.880]   conspiracy.
[01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:31.940]   I kid.
[01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:33.600]   What are your thoughts on this?
[01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:36.720]   When you say they have them dead to rights, like, what do you mean by that?
[01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:38.960]   What's your basis for saying that?
[01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:39.280]   Exactly.
[01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:40.240]   What do you mean?
[01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:42.080]   Dead to rights on what charge?
[01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:42.400]   Yeah.
[01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:49.200]   So in this indictment, the 45 pages, if you read it, you will see that they put up fake
[01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:56.160]   electorates and they knew that it wasn't going to work and they did it anyway after losing
[01:10:56.160 --> 01:10:56.960]   60 cases.
[01:10:56.960 --> 01:11:01.840]   So that's the belief of why this is such a serious case.
[01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:05.520]   And then also the coverup obstructing justice.
[01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:10.080]   And it looks like some of these maintenance workers are potentially flipping and Mark
[01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:12.480]   Meadows, they claim has flipped as well.
[01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:14.480]   So, but, you know, hey, listen, everybody gets their day in court.
[01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:16.320]   The documents case is sort of separate.
[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:18.080]   I mean, I think we should just stick to this.
[01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:19.280]   The big news here is...
[01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:22.640]   Well, what do you think of the fact that he tried this allegation that he tried to delete
[01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:23.120]   the videos?
[01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:24.640]   Do you think it's real or do you think it's made up?
[01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:25.280]   I don't know.
[01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:28.560]   That's a detail about a piece of evidence in that case.
[01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:36.640]   I do think the documents case is on a sounder legal footing than the January 6th case.
[01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:37.120]   More dangerous to him, you're saying.
[01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:38.080]   More dangerous to him.
[01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:40.800]   It doesn't involve as many novel legal theories.
[01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:42.560]   Now, is it really dangerous?
[01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:46.320]   I think the American people think that at the end of the day, that documents case is
[01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:47.520]   sort of a paperwork case.
[01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:53.760]   And there are many other people who violated the classified requirements rules like Sandy
[01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:57.120]   Berger, like David Petraeus, like Hillary Clinton, never prosecuted.
[01:11:57.120 --> 01:12:01.840]   So I think if they have him dead to rights on any of the cases, it's the documents case.
[01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:05.680]   But I also think that in the minds of the American people, that in the minds of the
[01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:08.800]   American people, it feels like DC inside baseball.
[01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:10.560]   Now, I think on this January 6th case...
[01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:12.480]   What do you think about the documents case?
[01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:13.440]   What do you personally think?
[01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:15.920]   I think if you're going to prosecute Trump for that, you need to prosecute all these
[01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:18.160]   other people who violated classified documents rules.
[01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:19.920]   What do you think about him?
[01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:25.200]   Sandy Berger, who worked for Clinton, who was a national security advisor, stuffed his
[01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:31.600]   pants with classified documents from one of those lean rooms and got away with a slap
[01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:32.320]   on the wrist.
[01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:34.480]   What do you think about Trump trying to overturn the election?
[01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:35.600]   Well, look...
[01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:37.360]   Do you think he tried to overturn the election?
[01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:38.880]   I mean, just a basic fact.
[01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:44.960]   Let me state right away that I think that what Trump did in the wake of the 2020 election
[01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:46.320]   was indefensible.
[01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:47.440]   I said so at the time.
[01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:48.080]   I said that...
[01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:48.640]   You did.
[01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:48.880]   I give the credit.
[01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:49.440]   I did say it.
[01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:54.400]   What I said is that once the Supreme Court, once the courts in general threw out his case,
[01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:57.840]   and once the Supreme Court denied certiorari, it was time for him to stop.
[01:12:57.840 --> 01:12:58.400]   And he kept going.
[01:12:58.400 --> 01:12:58.960]   He should have stayed on down.
[01:12:58.960 --> 01:12:59.520]   Yeah.
[01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:01.280]   It was time for him to stop, and he did it.
[01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:03.280]   And so I think that his actions were indefensible.
[01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:08.400]   However, when you're talking about criminal prosecutions, they can't just be an expression
[01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:09.360]   of condemnation.
[01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:13.680]   You actually have to prove that somebody engaged in criminal behavior.
[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:20.560]   And the issue here with this January 6th case is that it relies on novel legal theories.
[01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:24.480]   There's actually a really good article in the New York Times of all places explaining this.
[01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:29.280]   Do you think there was a possibility that if he could have, he would have turned over
[01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:32.560]   the election if Pence had gone along with it?
[01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:33.280]   I don't know.
[01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:35.280]   You're getting into a bunch of hypotheticals here.
[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:40.160]   The question is whether these charges will actually stand up to scrutiny.
[01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:45.520]   Let me read you what David Leonhardt from the New York Times reported, because I actually
[01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:48.640]   think when you have the New York Times saying that the case is weak, I think it's really
[01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:49.200]   indicative.
[01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:54.720]   So what the New York Times says, or Leonhardt says, "As shocking as it was, Trump's behavior
[01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:58.880]   on January 6th did not violate any laws in obvious ways.
[01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:02.240]   He never directly told those at the January 6th rally to attack Congress.
[01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:06.160]   During his speech that day, he even said he knew that protesters would behave peacefully
[01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:07.440]   and patriotically.
[01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:11.440]   It was part of a longstanding Trump pattern in which, as my colleague Maggie Haberman
[01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:15.440]   puts it, 'He is often both all over the place and yet somewhat careful not to cross
[01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:16.000]   certain lines.'"
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:21.440]   As for Trump's broader effort to overturn the election result, no federal law specifically
[01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:23.920]   bars politicians from attempting to do so.
[01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:28.080]   Without such a law, Smith has relied on a novel approach.
[01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:32.720]   He has charged Trump with committing criminal fraud and violating conspiracy laws that were
[01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:35.920]   not written to prevent the overturning of election result.
[01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:39.280]   And then he says that a key part of these laws, they revolve around a person's intent,
[01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:41.440]   intent is core to the notion of fraud.
[01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:45.280]   Only if someone is knowingly trying to deceive others can he be committing a fraud.
[01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:48.560]   And he says that's why the case seems like they revolve around Trump's state of mind.
[01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:53.360]   So the problem with this is they have to not only prove that what Trump did in the wake
[01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:57.760]   of the election was indefensible and outrageous and all the things that you believe, they
[01:14:57.760 --> 01:15:03.520]   have to prove that Trump knew that he lost the election and knowingly perpetrated the
[01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:03.840]   fraud.
[01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:06.400]   And I don't think you'll be able to ever prove that beyond a reasonable doubt.
[01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:08.880]   But even though, yes, there are statements that they point to.
[01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:13.840]   - Yeah, they got all those statements and then Bill Barr, Mark Meadows, everybody's
[01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:14.400]   flipped on him.
[01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:15.280]   Pence has flipped on him.
[01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:16.160]   They're all flipped on him now.
[01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:20.960]   - They have statements by those people, yes, but Trump also had this whack pack of lawyers.
[01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:26.560]   So you had Giuliani and you had Sidney Powell and John Eastman.
[01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:30.480]   And Mike Lindell, the pillow guy, they were all in the White House telling Trump that,
[01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:33.920]   "Listen, you won the election, you've been robbed, and there are valid legal grounds
[01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:34.960]   for you to contest this."
[01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:38.720]   And Trump for years has been maintaining the stolen election narrative.
[01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:42.400]   Even when his advisors have told him, "This is not good for you."
[01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:44.400]   The guy has stolen election on the brain, okay?
[01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:50.080]   Every interview, he's brought this up even when it's manifestly harmful to himself and
[01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:51.280]   the Republican Party.
[01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:56.880]   So this idea that you can prove that he doesn't really believe the election was stolen, the
[01:15:56.880 --> 01:16:01.040]   one thing I believe about Trump is that he really does believe the election was stolen.
[01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:05.920]   And I think you will never be able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he is knowingly
[01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:06.800]   lying about that.
[01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:09.360]   And as a result of this, you can never prove this case.
[01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:12.480]   Now, it also relies on this novel theory.
[01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:18.640]   They are turning the civil rights law into a pretzel to try and figure out a way to indict
[01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:24.320]   Trump or prosecute him under this novel legal theory of committing, quote, "fraud against
[01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:25.440]   the American people."
[01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:25.680]   Okay?
[01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:30.080]   This is a novel legal theory that's never been tried before.
[01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:33.920]   And by the way, if you're gonna create that as a precedent, I hope we're gonna go after
[01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:38.720]   those signers of the Lancet letter we talked about because they committed a fraud against
[01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:39.680]   American people.
[01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:44.160]   I hope that we will prosecute the 51 spies who lied because they perpetrated a fraud
[01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:45.280]   against American people.
[01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:46.160]   I hope...hold on a second.
[01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:51.280]   I hope we will go after the authors of that Steele dossier because they perpetrated a
[01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:52.000]   fraud of the American people.
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:55.280]   There's a lot of people in Washington who've perpetrated a fraud on the American people.
[01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:56.560]   I hope we're gonna go after all of them.
[01:16:56.560 --> 01:17:01.520]   But my point is this, it's not the job of a prosecutor to be creative with the law ever.
[01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:05.440]   I mean, they are supposed to apply the law strictly as written.
[01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:07.600]   They're supposed to bring cases that are open and shut.
[01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:14.960]   And what Jack Smith is doing here is going for this bank shot where he wants to charge
[01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:17.840]   Trump with incitement, but he knows he can't win that case.
[01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:22.800]   So he's going for this backdoor civil rights law to sidestep the First Amendment problem.
[01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:26.000]   And in my view, this is an abuse of prosecutorial power.
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:30.400]   And once you let prosecutors get creative like this, you're on a slippery slope to show me
[01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:32.880]   the man, I'll show you the crime as in Stalin's Russia.
[01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:38.240]   So listen, I believe that, again, Trump's actions were illegitimate and outrageous.
[01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:41.680]   But again, the purpose of criminal law is not to express disapproval.
[01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:46.560]   You have to be able to prove these cases in an open and shut way without novel legal theories.
[01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:50.640]   I just want to say I need to give I need to give sacks of 10 out of 10 for this last piece.
[01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:52.160]   That was excellent.
[01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:52.720]   Absolutely.
[01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:53.120]   Excellent.
[01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:54.880]   Jason, here's the question I ask you.
[01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:58.160]   Do you believe that Trump was guilty of inciting an insurrection?
[01:17:58.160 --> 01:17:58.720]   Absolutely.
[01:17:58.720 --> 01:17:58.960]   Yeah.
[01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:02.400]   When he told those people to, yeah, when he told those people to go down.
[01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:03.440]   Why hasn't Jack Smith?
[01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:06.880]   Why hasn't Jack Smith indicted Trump?
[01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:11.280]   They've indicted Trump on all these different charges with over 500 years of jail time.
[01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:13.040]   And they have not indicted him for incitement.
[01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:13.360]   Why not?
[01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:15.600]   They could always add to the charges.
[01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:18.080]   And so I suspect when they start flipping people, they will.
[01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:20.640]   But, you know, it's kind of meaningless to have this discussion.
[01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:21.600]   We should move on to the next.
[01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:22.000]   No, it's not.
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:22.480]   No, hold on.
[01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:22.800]   Hold on.
[01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:23.040]   Hold on.
[01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:23.440]   Let me finish.
[01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:24.240]   You asked me a question.
[01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:24.720]   Here's the thing.
[01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:25.120]   You know what?
[01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:30.960]   30% of people in the Republican Party, about 30% of this country have Trump Stockholm syndrome.
[01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:32.640]   They cannot let go of Trump.
[01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:35.040]   And so there's no reason to debate it with the GOP.
[01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:36.000]   They have TSS.
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:39.680]   And you're going to defend him to the dying day.
[01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:41.520]   You're going to do what about isms.
[01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:45.760]   The Republican Party will never accept the fact that this person's a criminal.
[01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:46.800]   He's corrupt.
[01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:47.920]   And he's a horrible human being.
[01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:49.600]   And he is not fit to serve.
[01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:51.600]   And you're going to serve him up as your candidate.
[01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:52.800]   It's disgraceful.
[01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:56.400]   The GOP is a disaster for actually supporting him.
[01:18:56.400 --> 01:18:58.560]   Guy has no morality.
[01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:01.040]   And he would have overturned the government if he had the chance.
[01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:02.000]   And he will do it again.
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:02.720]   Can I respond to this?
[01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:04.000]   I have a couple of points here.
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:04.240]   All right.
[01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:06.000]   So let me get as many points as you want.
[01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:10.160]   There are people who are absolutely fixated on January 6th.
[01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:14.320]   And it's the people who've been trying to whip this up and make it into a crime and
[01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:17.680]   invent all these novel legal charges and haven't stopped talking about for the last two and a half
[01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:18.160]   years.
[01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:21.120]   I'm so sick of talking about this whole January 6th thing.
[01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:23.120]   I don't want this to be our politics.
[01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:23.840]   OK?
[01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:28.080]   The people who've made it our politics include the mainstream media.
[01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:31.200]   It's all the people on CNN and MSNBC who won't stop talking about it.
[01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:37.760]   And part of the reason why I think Trump likely will be the nominee is because they are creating
[01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:42.640]   a backlash in the GOP where people basically think that he's being unfairly prosecuted
[01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:43.680]   and persecuted.
[01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:47.280]   Now, to my question, why aren't they charging him with incitement?
[01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:51.920]   That is the crime that the media says he has committed for the last two and a half years.
[01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:53.360]   So why aren't they charging him?
[01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:57.680]   Because the DOJ looked at that at the beginning of 2021.
[01:19:57.680 --> 01:20:00.400]   Merrick Garland's DOJ looked at that.
[01:20:00.400 --> 01:20:03.040]   And they did a report and found that they could not win that case.
[01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:08.560]   And when that came out, the media and even Biden himself said that Merrick Garland was
[01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:10.880]   basically being a wimp and should be tougher.
[01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:14.880]   And so that's when they appointed Jack Smith to be the special counsel to go find some
[01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:16.080]   other way of prosecuting him.
[01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:19.360]   And so that's why they've invented this novel legal theory.
[01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:24.160]   Now, I think the reason why we should care about this that has nothing to do with wanting
[01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:29.040]   to defend Trump or make him the nominee is that I don't think our political system should
[01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:34.000]   be weaponized this way, because when they can start inventing novel legal theories to
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.400]   get somebody, that's what they've done here, Jason.
[01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:38.080]   It's show me the man and I'll show you the crime.
[01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:43.920]   - Now, Trump tried to overthrow and reverse the election.
[01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:46.720]   And he tried to do that by putting up a fake slate.
[01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:49.760]   And he tried to convince Pence to go along with it.
[01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:52.400]   Pence is an honorable person who wouldn't go along with it.
[01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:56.240]   And everybody in his cabinet said, this is a bridge too far.
[01:20:56.240 --> 01:21:02.160]   His supporters from Barr to Pence to Meadows all told him, please stop.
[01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:03.600]   What you're doing is illegal.
[01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:06.800]   You cannot overturn the government, the election results.
[01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:12.320]   - But are you saying this as an expression of condemnation against Trump?
[01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:15.200]   Or are you saying that Jack Smith actually has?
[01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:16.800]   - I think it will be proven that he broke the law.
[01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:19.600]   I think it will be proven in the documents case that he also tried to cover it up.
[01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:20.800]   But that's just my opinion.
[01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:22.240]   I believe that he's a criminal.
[01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:23.600]   I believe he will be held accountable.
[01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:27.600]   I think he should be held accountable for trying to overthrow the election.
[01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:29.120]   He tried to overturn the election.
[01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:32.000]   That is the most treasonous thing you can do.
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.200]   You can come up with all of your defense of it.
[01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:35.680]   - They're charging with treason, charging with incitement.
[01:21:35.680 --> 01:21:36.480]   They have not done that.
[01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:39.120]   They've invented this non-illegal theory that never existed before.
[01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:43.280]   - He's a very smart guy when it comes to avoiding accountability.
[01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:46.320]   And I think that the clock is running out for him.
[01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:51.360]   - You know what, J. Cal, do you not think that it's a little surprising
[01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:58.240]   that all of these charges are hitting years after this event took place
[01:21:58.240 --> 01:22:00.560]   in the months leading up to the Republican primary?
[01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:01.680]   - No, I think it's...
[01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:03.440]   - That's the weirdest thing to me is like,
[01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:06.160]   why would it take so many years to prosecute someone?
[01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:09.040]   All those guys that went into the Capitol building,
[01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:12.240]   they all got charged with crimes years ago, two years ago.
[01:22:12.240 --> 01:22:14.640]   Why is all this stuff falling on Trump today?
[01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:17.120]   It's like they paced the grand jury investigation.
[01:22:17.120 --> 01:22:17.680]   - Because Trump wouldn't get in the case.
[01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:19.360]   - And they paced the whole thing out today.
[01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:19.600]   - It takes time to build these.
[01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:24.000]   - Because I will say it does feel like it is interrupting a political process
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.560]   that if there were criminal charges to be filed,
[01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:28.640]   I would have liked to have seen them filed two years ago.
[01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:31.920]   So this could all get adjudicated ahead of a political cycle.
[01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:33.520]   Now that it's in the middle of a political cycle,
[01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:37.040]   it makes me as a US citizen nervous about the fact
[01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:39.360]   that there are agencies interfering in the political cycle.
[01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:40.320]   - You're so right.
[01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:42.640]   - He could have given the documents back when they asked for them.
[01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:44.480]   And he could have said, don't delete the tapes.
[01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:45.760]   - We're talking about January 6th.
[01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:46.800]   - I'm talking about both.
[01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:47.440]   - Yeah, and it takes...
[01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:49.680]   - You changed the subject to the case that is...
[01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:50.960]   - No, I'm talking about both cases.
[01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:52.240]   I'm talking about both cases concurrently.
[01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:52.640]   We're talking about...
[01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:55.920]   - The documents case, I will say the documents case is more solid,
[01:22:55.920 --> 01:22:57.440]   but less important, okay?
[01:22:57.440 --> 01:22:57.680]   - Sure.
[01:22:57.680 --> 01:23:00.240]   - Actually, Leonhard says this in the New York Times.
[01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:01.520]   - But you asked me a question.
[01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:03.600]   I think it takes time to build a case properly.
[01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:06.960]   And it took them a long time to get through the 400 people
[01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:11.280]   who attacked the Capitol and brought tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition
[01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:14.320]   to the Capitol and put it in three hotels,
[01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:17.600]   which is why the Oath Keepers got 18 years.
[01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:21.120]   400 people have gotten sentenced in that for good reason.
[01:23:21.120 --> 01:23:22.560]   They beat cops.
[01:23:22.560 --> 01:23:25.600]   They broke down their way into the Capitol,
[01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:28.160]   and they brought dozens of AR-15s,
[01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:30.400]   and they bought tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition
[01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:32.640]   and placed them in hotels around the Capitol.
[01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:35.360]   These are dangerous, domestic terrorists.
[01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:36.800]   They would have shot the place up and killed hundreds of people.
[01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:38.720]   - Then try him for that. That's not what he's being indicted for.
[01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:40.560]   - No, I'm talking about who they...
[01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:43.120]   They already got those Oath Keepers on 18 years.
[01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:47.200]   - I just want to read this one sentence from Leonhardt just to wrap this up.
[01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:48.720]   Because this is the New York Times.
[01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:49.680]   This is the New York Times.
[01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:53.440]   He says, "You can think of the new charges as being both more important
[01:23:53.440 --> 01:23:56.720]   and less solid than Trump's previous federal indictment."
[01:23:56.720 --> 01:23:59.360]   - Yeah, no, I mean, listen, everybody's gonna have different opinions on this.
[01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:00.320]   I get that.
[01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:03.280]   I just hope he has his day in court, and I think he's guilty,
[01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:05.600]   and I think it'll be proven that he's guilty,
[01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:09.040]   and that it's time to start moving this towards a pardon
[01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:12.240]   and figuring out how to get him out of political life
[01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:14.960]   and give him a pardon for all these crimes he's committed
[01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:17.440]   and let him off the hook, but get him out.
[01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:20.080]   And so that your party can field a good candidate.
[01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:21.120]   That's what I hope happens.
[01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:25.200]   - I think one of the really tragic side effects of these prosecutions,
[01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:27.440]   where they're inventing novel legal theories, clearly,
[01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:29.840]   to get this man for what he did,
[01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:32.800]   even though it was outrageous, but I don't think criminal
[01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:34.560]   in the way you want it to be, Jason.
[01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:35.440]   But the really tragic thing about this...
[01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:36.480]   - It's not the way I want it to be.
[01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:38.080]   I would rather he didn't do this criminal activity.
[01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:39.280]   - Yeah, I get it. I get it.
[01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:40.640]   I've already denounced it.
[01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:41.680]   I've already denounced it.
[01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:43.360]   I'm not defending his actions.
[01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:45.680]   I'm defending the integrity of our legal system.
[01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:46.160]   - Sure.
[01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:47.680]   - And really the tragic thing about this...
[01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:47.920]   - I appreciate that.
[01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:51.680]   - The tragic thing about this is that I want the 2024 election
[01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:52.800]   to be about issues.
[01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:53.760]   It's not.
[01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:57.360]   It's gonna be a referendum on what happened in 2020.
[01:24:57.360 --> 01:24:59.600]   And there is no way to convince either side
[01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:02.640]   of the American people that they're wrong about that.
[01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:04.720]   The MSNBC, CNN crowd are gonna believe
[01:25:04.720 --> 01:25:06.640]   that Trump is guilty of a crime,
[01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:08.800]   no matter where this case comes out.
[01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:11.280]   And by the way, I think Trump's actually gonna win this case.
[01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:12.960]   Maybe not in the DC jury pool,
[01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:15.200]   but I think he'll win it on appeal.
[01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:16.560]   - The Supreme Court.
[01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:18.160]   - I think if he has to take it to the Supreme Court,
[01:25:18.160 --> 01:25:18.640]   he's gonna win it.
[01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:19.840]   'Cause this is a novel legal theory.
[01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:22.080]   By the way, Jack Smith took a case
[01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:24.560]   against the Virginia governor to the Supreme Court,
[01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:26.480]   got overturned on appeal 9-0
[01:25:26.480 --> 01:25:28.560]   because of an outrageous legal theory there.
[01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:30.160]   So that same thing could happen here.
[01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:30.960]   I think it probably will.
[01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:31.360]   - It's possible.
[01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:33.360]   - But those people who believe in this
[01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:34.320]   will never be convinced.
[01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:36.320]   And by the same token, Trump supporters,
[01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:38.320]   the other half of the country will never be convinced
[01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:41.440]   that this was not a political persecution.
[01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:42.240]   - It's TDS versus TSS.
[01:25:42.240 --> 01:25:45.440]   - So this will tear the country apart.
[01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:48.560]   And to Freeberg's point, it's two and a half years later.
[01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:49.920]   We could have just moved on.
[01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:51.280]   There's plenty of other things.
[01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:52.640]   They already have the Dockman's case.
[01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:57.040]   So this is a political prosecution by Biden's own DOJ.
[01:25:57.040 --> 01:25:58.960]   - Do you have any way to get out of this?
[01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:00.400]   What's your solution to get out of this?
[01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:01.520]   - We should have just moved on.
[01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:03.360]   - Oh, not charge him.
[01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:04.320]   - Yeah.
[01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:07.520]   Listen, the proper forum to deal with this
[01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:09.200]   was the impeachment hearing.
[01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:12.640]   The second impeachment was expressly on the correct charge,
[01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:15.360]   which was whether Trump incited an insurrection.
[01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:17.200]   They already had this trial.
[01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:20.080]   The proper forum was that impeachment trial.
[01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:21.920]   He made it through.
[01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:23.200]   And it's up to voters to take this-
[01:26:23.200 --> 01:26:24.880]   - Mitch McConnell actually said the proper one
[01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:25.680]   was to go criminal.
[01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:26.800]   So it was interesting.
[01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:27.200]   Yeah.
[01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:29.040]   He said the impeachment was the wrong way to do it.
[01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:29.840]   They should just do the criminal.
[01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:31.040]   So here we are doing the criminal thing.
[01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:32.720]   - The country should have moved forward.
[01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:34.320]   And instead we're getting torn apart.
[01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:34.560]   - You got any tailing data on it?
[01:26:34.560 --> 01:26:36.640]   - And this is what 2024 is now gonna be about.
[01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:38.880]   - What do you think, Freeberg?
[01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:40.400]   What do you think is a good path forward?
[01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:42.400]   - I kind of align with the fact that
[01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:43.760]   this is a little bit too late.
[01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:45.760]   It's in the middle of an election cycle
[01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:47.440]   and the damage that it will cause
[01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:51.280]   in terms of how our country views
[01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:53.760]   the intersection between the justice system
[01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:56.400]   and the electoral process can be more damaging
[01:26:56.400 --> 01:26:58.720]   than the benefit we would gain
[01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:00.400]   from bringing an individual to justice
[01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:01.920]   for breaking the law in this case.
[01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:04.640]   Unfortunately, the timing is just off.
[01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:05.840]   And I think it's really scary.
[01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:08.080]   - All right, Jason, you have to ask,
[01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:10.160]   what is actually gonna strengthen our democracy?
[01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:12.240]   And what is the wisdom of bringing these charges?
[01:27:12.240 --> 01:27:14.320]   I think this case shows a lack of wisdom.
[01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:15.840]   I don't think it's gonna strengthen our democracy.
[01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:17.040]   I think it's gonna undermine it.
[01:27:17.040 --> 01:27:19.200]   It's gonna make this country more polarized
[01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:20.720]   and hyper-partisan.
[01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:22.320]   And it's not gonna help us move past
[01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:23.760]   this era of our politics.
[01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:24.320]   And I believe that-
[01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:25.280]   - Was that a question towards me?
[01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:27.760]   - I think Trump is responsible
[01:27:27.760 --> 01:27:29.440]   for part of that polarization.
[01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:31.120]   But I think Biden now is playing into it
[01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:31.920]   from the other side.
[01:27:31.920 --> 01:27:34.880]   I don't think we've had a president seek to
[01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:38.240]   indict his leading political opponent,
[01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:38.960]   who's likely to be his-
[01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:40.080]   - Oh, I thought he was not involved in this.
[01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:41.920]   This is the Justice Department.
[01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:43.120]   He's not driving it.
[01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:45.040]   - Wait a second, that is not true.
[01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:45.920]   - Okay.
[01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:48.320]   Yeah, he's not involved in it.
[01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:51.760]   - No, there's an article in which Biden said
[01:27:51.760 --> 01:27:54.080]   that when Merrick Garland refused
[01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:55.280]   the incitement charges,
[01:27:55.280 --> 01:27:57.520]   that he thought that it was weak in that.
[01:27:57.520 --> 01:27:59.920]   Biden thought that Trump deserved to be prosecuted.
[01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:01.120]   And that was a public article.
[01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:02.080]   It's in the New York Times.
[01:28:02.080 --> 01:28:03.200]   And I'll provide the note.
[01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:03.840]   - Sure.
[01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:04.160]   - I'll provide the citation.
[01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:04.880]   - What's your question for me?
[01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:05.600]   Did you have a question?
[01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:07.120]   You said you wanted to ask me a question.
[01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:08.560]   - Well, no, I didn't say a question.
[01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:09.680]   I just said you can respond.
[01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:10.720]   - Oh, okay.
[01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:11.840]   - But my point is,
[01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:14.080]   I now think that Biden has crossed the line here.
[01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:15.360]   And just remember,
[01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:17.360]   this is not an independent prosecutor.
[01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:19.760]   Jack Smith works for Merrick Garland,
[01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:21.280]   who works for Joe Biden.
[01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:22.880]   This is banana republic type stuff.
[01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:24.880]   This is one president's DOJ
[01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:28.080]   seeking to prosecute his main political opponent.
[01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:29.840]   - Who put Merrick Garland in?
[01:28:29.840 --> 01:28:31.120]   - Biden appointed him.
[01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:33.520]   - Yeah.
[01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:35.840]   So this has been the All In Podcast.
[01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:36.880]   Chamath had to bounce.
[01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:39.600]   Freyberg, congratulations on OK99.
[01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:40.400]   I hope it happens.
[01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:42.160]   Sachs, sorry about-
[01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:44.080]   - Congratulations to you too.
[01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:45.600]   Congratulations to you too, Sachs.
[01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:47.840]   If it's proven to be real,
[01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:49.840]   we will all benefit.
[01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:50.560]   So it's great.
[01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:51.280]   - Yeah.
[01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:51.680]   - Right?
[01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:54.960]   - And we'll see you all next time on the All In Podcast.
[01:28:54.960 --> 01:28:55.360]   Bye-bye.
[01:28:55.360 --> 01:28:55.840]   - Bye-bye.
