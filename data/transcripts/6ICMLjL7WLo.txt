[00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.700]   hitting refresh and going thank god these companies have fundamentals because i haven't seen
[00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.260]   this much blood since game of thrones jason honestly at this run rate i can lose a trillion
[00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.620]   dollars
[00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:05.600]   how do you feel today compared to last march when the same thing was happening you know every day the
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.840]   market was down 10 percent well this is what's important we made a joke it was like it could
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:16.600]   only go down 10 so many days in a row march march uh 31st you you guys have to remember that march
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.920]   31st of 2020 the headlines all over the press and you can you know go to the way back machine and
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.600]   look at these things but the dow was down you know the stock price was down and the dollar was down
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:32.220]   20 some odd percent the s p was down 20 and it looked like the world was going to end and then
[00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:38.780]   we had our first big stimulus bill um and things started to look china started to reopen slowly and
[00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.220]   things started to look better and what's interesting is you have this rotational sort of
[00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.660]   deleveraging that's happening right now people are repricing in inflation people are moving into sort
[00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:55.580]   of these you know overlooked stories getting out of growth a little bit and it's a bloodbath um but
[00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.660]   i would just i would just encourage us all to remember that we were in some pretty dark days
[00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.580]   in march of last year as well and you know when you looked at it by the end of the year it looked
[00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.900]   amazing so i would just add to that the markets are looking pretty grim for tech stocks right now
[00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.340]   but this all started because of a really great jobs report showing that the economy is roaring
[00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:21.980]   back so we added 379 000 jobs in february which beat expectations by 200 000 they also revised
[00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.560]   the january gains up one hundred and sixty six thousand so now the unemployment rate is going to
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:32.760]   be down to six point two percent remember it was at like fifteen percent you know last summer during
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:39.320]   the the lockdowns for covet so i mean all of this is fundamentally due to i think really great news
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.200]   in the economy because covet is ending and which kind of begs the question of why we need another
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.960]   1.9 trillion dollar stimulus bill but but i think that ultimately there's a lot of good
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:55.540]   news in the real economy and what investors are doing is figuring out how to now put
[00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:01.600]   price or reprice uh all these different stocks in light of the economy roaring back so just a little
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.520]   just a little math lesson to build on what you're saying you know everybody has a risk-free rate
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:12.960]   and all stocks are priced according to that risk-free rate and when you know for the many for
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:18.320]   the last sort of year particularly when risk-free rates were essentially zero to negative meaning
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.720]   you know that's that's the riskless money where you that you get from the government
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.520]   um it was hard to do anything except belong growth stocks
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:31.140]   in a big big way um but david to your point if we get two or three more quarters of these kinds
[00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:36.700]   of jobs numbers you're going to have a you know low single digit unemployment number and what that
[00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:43.340]   means is wages will have to go up for businesses to compete and that's the kind of traditional form
[00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:49.700]   of inflation that actually reprices things because you then you lever up rates to kind of control
[00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:54.020]   inflation when you lever up rates and you you know all of a sudden they're not zero but they're two
[00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.500]   three four five six percent and you're going to have a low single digit unemployment number and
[00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.600]   you're going to have a low single digit unemployment number and you're going to have a low single digit
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.080]   unemployment number and you're going to have a low single digit unemployment number and you're going to have a low single digit
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.440]   this is sort of what brought the tech bubble to a halt in 2000 which is that you know you had six
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:06.880]   percent real rates and so you can't own businesses that are projecting revenues let alone profits in
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:12.760]   2026 um when you can invest your money in a bond and make six percent six percent and that's what i
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:18.280]   like so just for folks that don't know this week started with this big bond sell-off and what that
[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:23.480]   means is bonds that used to yield zero percent when you sell them they're now yielding ten year
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.480]   treasuries i think are at one and a half points right so you're you're you're going to have a lot of
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:31.220]   and so as an investor if i can make one and a half percent with no risk by owning us treasuries over
[00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:37.340]   the next 10 years that may feel like a better bet than owning some risky asset um some speculative
[00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:44.560]   company now the other thing that that it has done and chamath correct me if i'm off on this but what
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.800]   i'm hearing is that that higher rate because bonds sold down because people are expecting inflation
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:55.460]   to come back up the interest rates to borrow money are going up and so if you're a hedge fund
[00:05:55.460 --> 00:06:00.340]   or a institutional money manager over the last year or so you've been able to borrow money for
[00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:05.620]   zero percent you can lever up your portfolio and and and buy as many stocks as you want without
[00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:10.020]   paying any interest on it and now that rates are creeping back up people are de-levering they're
[00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:15.540]   they're taking risk off and that's causing a sell-off in both bonds and stocks and especially
[00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:20.980]   on the speculative end of the market where you know there's been um obviously unchecked kind of
[00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:25.440]   investment capital no you're you're you're you're absolutely right like look at the at the at the
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:30.740]   end of the day the cost of borrowing for a company goes up what that's really saying is the investor
[00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:37.220]   that's lending them the money um you know has other alternatives um and so then they're willing
[00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:41.980]   to charge you more and more for this for this capital and as that happens you'll see some
[00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:46.980]   companies get into potentially some real trouble because you know they're going to be borrowing
[00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:50.420]   money at rates where they can't necessarily generate the cash flows in the future to pay
[00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:55.420]   those things back at the same time as you said if you look at sort of like you know the spas
[00:06:55.420 --> 00:07:02.240]   market has taken a real beating um what are what are spax really well you know in many ways spax are
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:08.920]   synthetic bonds right and and the reason is because you know if you go and buy a if you go and buy a
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:16.360]   spac one share of any spac you have the ability to redeem that if you don't like the deal that it does
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:22.880]   and get back your coupon so you know you're notional rather so if you were to buy a government
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.400]   you know german bond at negative one percent you know you're not going to be able to buy a government
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:30.780]   loan at negative one percent or buy any spac where you can put that same you know ten dollars to work
[00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:35.100]   and get back ten dollars well you do that versus getting back nine dollars and ninety cents so in
[00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:40.060]   many ways like you know the spac market benefited from rates at zero because you could synthetically
[00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:45.940]   be long spax as almost a way of being synthetically long fixed income now as rates go up that's not
[00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:52.100]   true so what that leaves in the spac market are actually people who want to own long-term equity
[00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:55.380]   and if you combine that with what we just said which is the cost of capital
[00:07:55.380 --> 00:08:00.240]   going up and the discount rate going up now all of a sudden companies need to be really real and
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:03.660]   you're seeing that because if you look at the companies that have just announced back deals
[00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:09.300]   just in the last few days their stocks have gotten absolutely obliterated and they're right on the
[00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:13.540]   knife's edge going into the redemption period so if you have one or two more months of this
[00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:20.080]   where all of a sudden bonds look better and you know some of these spax post announcement
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:25.360]   but pre DS backing go through you know ten bucks a share people just redeem for ten dollars and
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:30.460]   you'll have a you'll have a bunch of busted IPOs or by the way by the way another thing we're seeing
[00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:34.840]   sorry Jason but another thing I think we're seeing right now is in the near term is a feedback loop
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:40.900]   so as selling takes place what happens is market participants are jumping in and short selling and
[00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:46.340]   participating in the trend of that stock and so there are these these kind of experiences that
[00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:50.840]   are underway where it's not just about a sell-off of owners but it's also about a momentum trade
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:55.340]   that a lot of people are playing into and so there is a very short-term extremely competitive
[00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:59.400]   compounded effect of the de-levering that's happening and the cycling that's happening in
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:03.860]   these markets and so it's super volatile and probably will be for a little bit of time here
[00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:09.380]   right I think so I think we need to figure out whether there's really whether there's a real
[00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:15.680]   inflation risk dragon cooking someplace if there if there really is inflation like again you have
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:20.900]   to think like the trillions of dollars we put into the economy eventually has to come out in
[00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:25.320]   productive goods and services and the all of that excess capital
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:30.540]   will probably inflate prices now it begs a different question which is we maybe we've
[00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:35.140]   just actually been missing inflation all along because if you ask somebody who lives in a city
[00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:39.560]   you know what the cost of rent has been that that thing has been inflating by feels like
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:44.640]   20% a year for years so and health care and education costs and health care and education
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:48.900]   so maybe we've just done a really terrible job in the last few years of actually measuring
[00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:53.340]   inflation the way it should be you know it's calling this whole basket of you know you know
[00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:55.300]   CPI X energy like I don't know what the hell is going on with the economy right now and so I think
[00:09:55.300 --> 00:10:00.580]   I mean it's kind of nutty maybe the whole thing just made no sense a few years ago to David's
[00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:05.380]   point and David gave me just a huge bag of red pills while we were off this week so I've been
[00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:10.180]   just I've been on a bender on these red pills but if you look at those three categories what
[00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:16.480]   do they have in common education health care and housing massive regulation uh and then if
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:22.000]   you look at the things that have gone down consumer goods electronics food Etc or have
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.280]   stayed flat in terms of inflation those are things that the free
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:30.080]   market participates the government's not involved and it's not just the fact there's a lot of
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:35.120]   government regulation in things like health care and education it's also that the government pays
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:40.820]   for a significant portion of it and so there's no reason for the people you know who are billing the
[00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:45.320]   government to keep costs down I mean this is why the price of education of a college degree keeps
[00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:50.480]   going up is because the government's paying for a lot of it I I I David you probably I I think
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:55.260]   you you may have seen this but when you know when we announced um our merger with Clover for
[00:10:55.260 --> 00:11:02.520]   ipoc one of the first slides I put up there was the only place in the market since 2010 where you
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:07.920]   would have made more money than being long Facebook and Google and Apple and Amazon was
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:13.980]   being long United healthcare Cigna Wellspring and the reason is because health care was this
[00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:19.440]   incredible thing post Obamacare nobody wants to talk about it on the left because it makes
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:25.240]   it look terrible but we created massive price inflation and United health care was a 30
[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:29.860]   billion dollar company narrative violation be careful right before right before Obamacare passed
[00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:37.180]   today it's a 330 billion dollar company um and the level of growth that they and Etna and you
[00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:43.840]   know Cigna and Wellspring these con these companies have have seen is astounding so these highly
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:49.300]   regulated you know systems of societal infrastructure that's where all the gains have been
[00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:54.700]   regulatory capture writ large right well as soon as the government is paying for it all the suppliers
[00:11:55.220 --> 00:12:00.080]   are going to increase their prices why wouldn't they so it's what happens is the government tries
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:04.520]   to make something free for people and all they end up doing is making it really expensive well
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:09.440]   they make it they make it now they make they make it expensive in this very in this very
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:14.360]   convoluted way which is hard to track right because it's like you know uh who's actually
[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:19.340]   paying well you know the insurance companies want to just book more revenue even if they're you know
[00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:25.200]   even if their gross aggregate profit grows much much more slowly they'd rather make the same
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:30.300]   amount of profit on a billion dollars versus a hundred million dollars so what do they do their
[00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:36.120]   incentive is to just Jack prices up who are paying those prices companies pay those prices who bears
[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:41.160]   those costs all of this stuff is really not clear because ultimately downstream somebody has to pay
[00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:46.980]   for this stuff taxpayers and it's all obscurified I mean look I mean look at the tent story that we
[00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:53.100]   were sharing on our group group thread 61 000 for San Francisco to put people into tents with a no
[00:12:55.180 --> 00:13:03.640]   for for you all um is if we look back the last time we were at six percent unemployment July 2014
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:09.820]   we look at the unemployment graph it's spiked up to as we discussed 15 and it has plummeted back
[00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:17.380]   down now to uh the six percent rate if we look back on this moment in time and how quickly the
[00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:23.320]   economy is recovering from this disaster that we've never experienced before it looks like this
[00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:25.160]   recession is going to be
[00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:30.920]   recovered and we're gonna we're already back in business in such a short period of time compared
[00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:38.240]   to what happened in the Great Recession and the dot-com boom so is America and the U.S dollar and
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:44.360]   the economy anti-fragile now to use a teleb term what how do we look at what happened with the
[00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:48.620]   economy did Trump do everything right with the stimulus this is a this is a complete outlier in
[00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:55.140]   the following way in a typical recession what what has to happen is so you have a contraction in the
[00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:59.940]   economy but you don't know when the bottom is right the bottom is some number of months in the
[00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:06.260]   future and government policy is basically trying to create a soft landing where all of a sudden the
[00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:10.860]   cost of capital is low enough now where people say ah on the margin now this incremental dollar
[00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:14.880]   I would rather borrow and invest which drives growth which can then gets the economy growing
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:20.580]   going and so you know how does a government deal with that they are looking at economic data and
[00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:24.640]   saying okay you know what let me cut rates I'll cut rates again I'll cut rates again and that's
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:25.120]   really the one thing that's going to be a problem because if you look at the economic data and saying
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:28.960]   one tool that they have in their toolbox because they're trying to predict in the future, how
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:32.260]   many rate cuts do I need to get or have rather?
[00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:36.920]   How big do they need to be until I get to that place where you bottom out?
[00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:40.600]   The pandemic was the exact opposite because in many ways, we actually hit the bottom in
[00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:43.620]   month one because we said, "Everything go to zero right now."
[00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:50.140]   When you shut everything down, you technically can't have less economic activity than zero.
[00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:53.620]   In many ways, you price the bottom on day one.
[00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:54.620]   Boom.
[00:14:54.620 --> 00:15:00.600]   In hindsight, the real insight would have been to see that and say, "I'm buying this
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:04.840]   moment because it only gets better from here."
[00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:09.380]   In one way, it's like all of the tools are actually now we need to think about them in
[00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:10.680]   opposite.
[00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:14.600]   I don't think we have that training to do that well.
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:18.580]   We're still going back to the same toolbox, which is why what David said is so true.
[00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:24.120]   We're thinking about incremental stimulus as a way to get to a soft landing, but we've
[00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:26.780]   already actually taken the hard medicine a year ago.
[00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:27.780]   Let's tackle that.
[00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:32.300]   Sax, should we, and let's take virtue signaling and populism out of this discussion just on
[00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:34.700]   an economic basis.
[00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:41.800]   Is it necessary to send every American another 600,000, 2,000 knowing what we know today
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:43.620]   with the unemployment rate going down?
[00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:50.120]   Would we be better off taking that capital and deploying it in education, unemployment,
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:51.120]   or something else?
[00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:52.120]   Right.
[00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:53.120]   First of all, it's 1.9%.
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.120]   Right.
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.120]   It's $3 trillion that we don't have.
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.120]   We're borrowing it.
[00:15:56.120 --> 00:16:00.420]   I would extend unemployment for people in those hard hit sectors that haven't come back
[00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:06.120]   yet, but most of this money is going for blue state bailouts of cities that are totally
[00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:07.520]   mismanaged.
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:11.900]   This is not going to help states like California or cities like San Francisco get their house
[00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:15.840]   in order because this is going to bail them out and defer that day of reckoning from their
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:17.960]   chronic mismanagement.
[00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:21.780]   We're borrowing money we don't have to bail out people, cities and states that don't really
[00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:22.780]   deserve it.
[00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:28.880]   I do think we should help the people who've been impacted, but it doesn't require 2 trillion.
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:29.880]   And look, here's the thing.
[00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:31.680]   We're already down to 6% unemployment.
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:36.180]   We're going to be down to, I'd say probably three or 4% in two quarters.
[00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:37.720]   I mean, the economy is coming roaring back.
[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:40.580]   And the reason it's coming roaring back is because COVID is ending.
[00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:41.580]   Right?
[00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:44.920]   So the biggest announcement recently, and I think this is playing into what's happening
[00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:49.440]   in the stock market as well, is that Biden announced that every American who's over the
[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:52.740]   age of 16 who wants a vaccine will be able to get one by the end of May.
[00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:53.740]   I mean, we're going to have 300 million doses.
[00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:54.740]   Yeah, what happened to the fall?
[00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:55.740]   Yeah.
[00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:56.740]   Right.
[00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:57.740]   Well, he was-
[00:16:57.740 --> 00:16:58.740]   Cut six months off this.
[00:16:58.740 --> 00:16:59.740]   Yeah.
[00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:02.740]   When he came into office in January, he's saying the worst is not over.
[00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:04.620]   I mean, that was clearly sandbagging.
[00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:06.660]   The worst was over.
[00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:09.280]   And we're going to have 300 million doses by the end of May.
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:14.540]   And the only reason why everybody won't be able to get one is because of states that
[00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:17.740]   are creating these ridiculous hoops to get through.
[00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:18.740]   Confiscating them.
[00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:19.740]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:21.740]   Like California right now has 3 million doses sitting on a shelf.
[00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:22.740]   Because of COVID.
[00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:26.760]   Because of all the crazy hoops that Gavin Newsom has everyone going through because
[00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:30.880]   he wants to score brownie points on equity, right?
[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:33.720]   So if the government would just get out of the way, let everyone who wants to get a vaccine
[00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:37.860]   get one without worrying about making sure the exact right person in the exact right
[00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:41.240]   line gets one first, this thing will be over by Memorial Day.
[00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:42.240]   Over.
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:44.360]   Now, look, there'll still be a case here or there.
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:47.920]   For sure there'll be, I'm not saying there'll be zero cases of COVID, but there'll be zero
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:51.020]   pandemic understood as such.
[00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:52.020]   By the way.
[00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:58.300]   I'll say one other, you know, important point about the stimulus one that that Saks made.
[00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:01.100]   Yesterday the CBO put out a projection.
[00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:07.720]   This is the the budget office, I think Congress and they said that the US national debt is
[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:13.460]   likely to reach 202% of GDP by 2051.
[00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:18.600]   So the amount of debt that the US government will own is 2x the amount of all the revenue
[00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:21.300]   generated by all of the industries in the US.
[00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:23.800]   In about 30 years.
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:24.800]   That's an insane statistic.
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:29.400]   And the reason that people look at, you know, GDP or debt to GDP is because you have to
[00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:33.140]   pay your debt down at some point, you owe some interest on that debt, you have to pay
[00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:34.140]   it down.
[00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:37.180]   And every year you have to generate revenue to pay the bondholders.
[00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:40.320]   And how do you how does the federal government generate revenue to either issues more debt
[00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:41.920]   or taxes.
[00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:48.160]   And in order to meet a 202% level of debt relative to GDP, you end up raising taxes
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:49.180]   so significantly as a percent of GDP to cover the entire GDP.
[00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:50.180]   So that's a huge statistic.
[00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:51.180]   And the reason that people look at, you know, GDP or debt to GDP is because you have to pay
[00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:52.180]   your debt down.
[00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:53.180]   And every year you have to pay your debt down.
[00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:54.180]   And every year you have to pay your debt down.
[00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:55.180]   And every year you have to pay your debt down.
[00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:56.180]   And every year you have to pay your debt down.
