[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.560]   I should like to call your attention this morning to that great incident in the life
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.560]   and ministry of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, the account of which we read at the
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:20.320]   beginning in the fourth chapter of the Gospel according to St. John, our Lord's encounter
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.360]   in dealing with the woman of Samaria.
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.840]   Let me read again verses 13 and 40.
[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:36.360]   Jesus answered and said unto her, "Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again;
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.760]   but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:48.900]   water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water, springing up into everlasting
[00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:49.900]   life."
[00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:56.840]   Now, we began our study of this great incident last Sunday morning, and we have dealt with
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.160]   it and are proposing to go on dealing with it from the standpoint of the light which
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:11.320]   it throws on our spiritual condition, as it shows us something of the possibilities of
[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.360]   this spiritual, this Christian life into which we have come.
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.960]   The story is primarily one, of course, of evangelism, but the principles that govern
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.440]   evangelism are exactly the same as the principles that continue to govern the whole of the Christian
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.440]   life.
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.360]   And, as I was indicating last Sunday morning, there is here conceivably some of the richest
[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.000]   teaching that we will ever find anywhere.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.800]   Take the two verses that I have just read to you.
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.480]   There is no fuller statement of the Gospel than that.
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.800]   The higher reaches of the Gospel, I mean.
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.080]   There is nothing beyond that.
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.760]   And the amazing thing, as we saw last Sunday, was that it was to this woman of Samaria that
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.320]   our Lord made that great and that glorious statement.
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.400]   So I have read those verses again for this reason.
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:08.200]   That is the true Christian life when we are in that position, when we know that we have
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:17.880]   within us a well of water springing up into everlasting life, never thirsting.
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:24.680]   That is true Christianity, that is the essence and the meaning of this great salvation.
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:32.320]   The Son of God came into the world to do that, not merely to procure forgiveness of sins,
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:40.360]   but to give us this life which is life indeed, this fullness that never fails.
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.200]   So the great question for us is, my friends, have we got that?
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:51.540]   These are not just words to be uttered in the emotional atmosphere of an evangelistic
[00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.080]   meeting.
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.080]   These are words that come to us who claim to be Christians.
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.380]   The question is, I say, what do we know about this?
[00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.960]   To what extent have we and are we experiencing this?
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.880]   Well now then, that is the subject matter here, you see.
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.640]   But of course, the story does not merely consist of this statement.
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:19.960]   We are given all these details about what happened between our Lord and this woman and
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.520]   how he dealt with the whole situation.
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.880]   So we began last Sunday by taking a general view of the whole story and we found that
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.960]   even that is full of very rich and most encouraging teaching.
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:38.520]   It is a great mistake simply to isolate certain verses in the Scripture.
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.080]   Nothing in Scripture is unimportant.
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.600]   Keep your eye on everything, examine everything.
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.500]   There are riches to be found here if we only take the trouble to look for them, which constantly
[00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.280]   amaze us and astonish us.
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:57.000]   So we looked at the woman in general and learned certain lessons from her, from the fact that
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.080]   it was to her that these great words were uttered.
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:09.240]   And then we ended by looking at our Lord himself, this amazing thing we are told here, that
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:15.520]   the one by whom all things were made and created, the one who upholds all things by the word
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:21.160]   of his power, was so tired and weary that he could not go into the city to buy provisions
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:32.680]   with his followers, but sat down by the side of the well, the Lord of glory, weary.
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:38.720]   And he did all that, that you and I might have this gift of this well of water springing
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.040]   up within us.
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.040]   We worked that out, you remember.
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:47.360]   His great concern for us, even though he was thirsty, he was more concerned about the woman's
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.240]   spiritual thirst and need.
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.880]   His amazing knowledge of us, and we ended on this note, the fourth verse, "He must
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.080]   needs go through Samaria."
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:03.880]   And the significance of that, this wasn't an accidental meeting.
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.280]   He didn't have to go through Samaria because it was the only road, there were alternatives.
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.880]   No, no, this is a part of the eternal purpose.
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:18.880]   He went through Samaria to meet with this woman and to teach her a great lesson, and
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.600]   through her to teach the Samaritans a great lesson, and through them to teach us all a
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:30.120]   great lesson with regard to the fact of the largeness, the comprehensiveness of this great
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.120]   salvation.
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:37.120]   He broke down one of the middle walls of partition by doing this, that wall of partition that
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:42.600]   was dividing and separating Greeks as Samaritans and Jews.
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:47.360]   The Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:55.160]   Now, we ended on that note, but now there is still one other aspect of our Lord himself
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:00.840]   and his dealing with this situation that I'm anxious to put to your consideration.
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:07.040]   For here again, I think you will find that we will derive not only instruction and benefit,
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:12.880]   but great encouragement, and that's the object of all that we are attempting to do.
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.520]   Look at our Lord's method.
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:19.400]   His method is so important.
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:25.760]   The way in which he dealt with this whole situation is one that tells us a great deal
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.040]   about ourselves.
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.160]   He still does the same.
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.760]   That's the wonderful thing.
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:35.160]   He is still the same in the glory.
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:40.160]   You remember how John, in the first chapter of the book of Revelation, tells us about
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:46.360]   the vision he had of him, the revelation of him, and when he saw him he fell as one dead.
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.360]   But then this same Lord put his hand upon him.
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:54.680]   That's the sort of thing he did while he was here in the days of his flesh.
[00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.240]   He's still doing it.
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.200]   He's still the Lamb that once was slain.
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.320]   He's alive forevermore.
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:05.280]   He was once dead, but there he is.
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:09.080]   So what he did in the days of his flesh, he is still doing.
[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:15.440]   He does it now, of course, chiefly through the work and the operations of the Holy Spirit.
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.200]   But it is his action.
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:23.040]   You remember how Luke starts his second book, namely the book of the Acts of the Apostles,
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:30.160]   the former treatise by written or Theophilus, of all the things that Jesus began to do.
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:36.000]   And now he's going on to tell him in the book of the Acts of the Apostles of the continuing
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.960]   works of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:41.440]   And he does these, I say, through the Holy Spirit.
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.160]   And that is what we are doing this morning.
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.840]   And this is the comfort of all this to us.
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:52.040]   The way he handled the woman of Samaria is the way in which he handles us.
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:58.120]   He continues to handle people in this exact and precise manner.
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:04.360]   And so, you see, we meet together with this feeling uppermost in our minds that our being
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:10.920]   here at this moment is not accidental, that he orders all things for our good and for
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:11.920]   our benefit.
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:18.000]   He must, needs go through Samaria in order to meet this particular person.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.800]   He meets with us in the same way.
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.640]   Let's realize that.
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:27.480]   We may have thought we've come up here from customer of habit, but believe me, if you're
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:30.440]   in his hands, there's more than that to it.
[00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:35.400]   He arranges these things for our good and for our eternal benefit.
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:39.040]   Well, now, look at his method, I say.
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:40.040]   What is it?
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:45.760]   Well, the first thing we notice is this, that he's always in complete control.
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:50.920]   He always handles the situation.
[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:53.800]   It is he who deals with us.
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:58.080]   That's the thing that strikes us on the very surface of this story.
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.280]   It appears to be accidental.
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:00.520]   It isn't, I say.
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:05.120]   But watch how he handles the whole situation from beginning to end.
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.080]   Thank God for this.
[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:12.480]   If he didn't, not a single one of us would ever be saved, would never be a Christian,
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.400]   would never arrive in the glory.
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:21.960]   Our comfort, our greatest consolation is that he is in charge.
[00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:27.320]   This woman with her glibness and her cleverness talks a lot and riddles, as I'm going to show
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:31.040]   you, but he commands the situation.
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:36.360]   And my dear friend, if you are a Christian at all, he commands your situation.
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:38.240]   Be careful what you're doing.
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.240]   Be very careful.
[00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:40.240]   He is in charge.
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:42.480]   He is in control.
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:45.840]   And he will bring us to the desired end.
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:49.800]   The author of the epistle to the Hebrews puts that like this, "Whom the Lord loveth, he
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:55.240]   chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he calleth."
[00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:58.720]   If you are one of his people, be careful, I say.
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:09:59.720]   He is in charge.
[00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:01.360]   He's taken hold of you.
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:02.680]   You're in his hands.
[00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:06.960]   And if you don't come willingly by way of appeal, he'll get you there.
[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:10.080]   "Whom the Lord loveth, he chasteneth."
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:13.960]   He is in charge and in control.
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:18.800]   If you are in control of your religion, I doubt whether you're a Christian at all.
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:23.920]   If you're not conscious of being in his hands and of being dealt with, I think you'd better
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:27.040]   examine your foundations again.
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:33.000]   Once he sets his heart and affection upon a person, he always takes charge and he doesn't
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   let go.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:40.080]   So I say at this moment, this is a question we ask ourselves, and it's a very searching
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:41.080]   question.
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:46.440]   And if we know that we are in his hands, we have the greatest comfort and the greatest
[00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:50.760]   consolation that a human soul can ever have.
[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:59.160]   Here it is then, read the story again for yourselves and watch him as he is in absolute
[00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:03.320]   control of the entire situation.
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:10.840]   But then I want to add immediately to that his amazing gentleness.
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:13.340]   Look at his gentleness with this woman.
[00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:15.800]   Remember the character of the woman.
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:21.040]   This woman living in adultery and who'd been doing so for some time.
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:25.600]   Notice his gentleness with respect to her.
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:28.520]   He doesn't bludgeon her.
[00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:30.520]   He doesn't force the situation.
[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:33.520]   He's in control, but that doesn't mean force.
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:36.400]   That doesn't mean doing violence to her.
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.840]   That doesn't mean dragooning.
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.460]   Our Lord never did that.
[00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:45.280]   What we are told about him is this, that in him is verified the prophecy concerning him,
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:52.400]   the bruised reed he will not break, the smoking flex he will not quench.
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:12:01.640]   I say once more, thank God for this, for what are all of us, bruised reeds, smoking flex.
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:06.040]   You know smoking flex, it's difficult to tell whether there's any fire there or not.
[00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:08.960]   There's a good deal of smoke, but is there any fire?
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:10.920]   It's almost impossible to tell.
[00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:15.720]   And our tendency is to stamp upon something like that and say there's nothing there.
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:16.720]   It's only a smouldering.
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.640]   There's no life there any longer.
[00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:22.640]   The fire is gone and we crush it.
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:24.160]   Our Lord didn't do that.
[00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:27.980]   And I say again, none of us would be here this morning if he did that.
[00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:30.840]   But that's the opposite of what he does.
[00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:35.680]   One is amazed at his gentleness with this woman.
[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:39.960]   And this is the experience of all the saints, isn't it?
[00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:46.640]   You remember the hymn of Philip Duttridge, "Oh happy day that fixed my choice."
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:53.080]   He puts it like this, "He drew me and I followed on."
[00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:56.280]   Charmed to confess the voice divine.
[00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:57.280]   He drew me.
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:05.640]   He's now thinking of course of that word in the prophet Hosea, "He drew me with the cords
[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:07.360]   of a man."
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:11.000]   He draws, he never drives.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.040]   Now we're always in danger of forgetting this, aren't we?
[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:18.680]   And we want to foist our opinions upon people and to force them.
[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:20.600]   It can't be done in this realm.
[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:26.840]   And in any case, we are so unlike our Master when we attempt to do that, the gentleness.
[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:34.180]   Or take it as the Apostle Paul puts it in Romans 8, 14, "As many as are led by the Spirit
[00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:37.640]   of God, they are the sons of God."
[00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:39.360]   But you notice how he puts it.
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:49.640]   The sons of God are those who are led by the Spirit, not driven, not carried, but led.
[00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:52.480]   The Spirit persuades.
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:53.560]   He puts the truth to us.
[00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:54.560]   He enlightens us.
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:57.160]   He leads us on.
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:02.880]   And there is nothing more remarkable, they say, than this very element as you read this
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:03.880]   great story.
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:09.560]   But we've got to remember this in our own spiritual lives and experiences.
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:13.640]   Don't forget the Holy Spirit is said to resemble a dove.
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:15.720]   He's gentle.
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:17.460]   He woos.
[00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:18.620]   He leads.
[00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:20.060]   He persuades.
[00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:21.940]   He suggests.
[00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:25.660]   He works in us both the will and to do of his good pleasure.
[00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:28.240]   And he can be grieved.
[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:30.720]   He can be quenched.
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:33.520]   So here, I say, is a great lesson for us.
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:37.480]   We're in a realm here which is very sensitive.
[00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:40.600]   The soul, the spirit.
[00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:46.700]   We're in a realm that is so unlike the clash and the clamor and the noise of the world
[00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:49.040]   that is outside.
[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:53.840]   We forget that, I say, at our peril and to our very great loss.
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:55.480]   But then notice another thing.
[00:14:55.480 --> 00:15:00.960]   Here's what I may call indirect method.
[00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:05.340]   You notice how he spoke to the woman, as it were, in a riddle.
[00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:09.660]   He goes to Samaria to meet the woman because he's concerned about herself.
[00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:13.880]   But he doesn't immediately take hold of her and say, "Are you saved?"
[00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:16.880]   That's how you and I tend to do this in some of us, isn't it?
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:17.880]   No, no.
[00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:19.720]   He has an indirect method.
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:23.320]   "He then cometh, the woman of Samaria, to draw water.
[00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:26.160]   Jesus saith unto her, 'Give me to drink.'"
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:29.240]   And you remember how the conversation goes on.
[00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:35.840]   They seem to be speaking of cross purposes because he is speaking in this indirect manner.
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:39.040]   He is putting a riddle to her, as it were.
[00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:42.800]   When she says, "How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:44.040]   of Samaria?"
[00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:47.640]   Jesus answered and said unto her, "If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:50.840]   said to me, 'Give me to drink,' thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given
[00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:51.960]   thee living water."
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:57.840]   It's still indirect, suggesting she doesn't know who he is, and he knows that.
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:02.080]   And he knows that he's talking about a type of water that she doesn't understand and know
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:03.080]   about.
[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:05.320]   But still, this is his method.
[00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:12.120]   And thus, gradually and indirectly, he brings her face to face with the vital thing.
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:13.680]   What's the application of this to us?
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:20.120]   Well, the application of this to us is this, that he still does very much the same thing.
[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:24.720]   And we often miss him because we don't realize this.
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:29.360]   You've got an idea that these things are going to happen directly in some dramatic, climactic
[00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:30.360]   moment.
[00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:35.000]   They do sometimes, but not always by any means.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.960]   You never know where you're going to find the Lord.
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:43.200]   You never know what kind of question is going to bring you to him.
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:46.040]   I'm an advocate of this indirect method.
[00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:49.260]   I've been saying it for many years from this pulpit.
[00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:53.120]   The best method of evangelism is, to me, always the indirect one.
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:58.400]   I'm saying this in passing, but what an opportunity we have for evangelism as individuals at the
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:16:59.400]   present time.
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:01.460]   I mean something like this.
[00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:05.000]   You needn't start by talking to people about their souls always.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.760]   Talk to them about the state of the world.
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:11.600]   Talk to them about the state of society.
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:15.360]   Start there, a good way off, as it were, a general question.
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:21.280]   And then, as you handle that, you'll be able to lead them on to their own personal condition
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:23.200]   and the state of their own soul.
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:27.440]   Well now, that's how we are to do to others, as our Lord did with this woman.
[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:31.520]   But as I say, he still does that with us.
[00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:38.000]   And you may well find that he will teach you the most wonderful spiritual lessons you've
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.560]   ever had, in a way that you'd never have imagined.
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:47.680]   Certainly that is my experience, as it has been the experience of God's people throughout
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:48.920]   the centuries.
[00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:56.520]   He may speak to you through a physical illness, something far away from the spiritual content
[00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:57.520]   as you would imagine.
[00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:59.800]   But you see, we are one.
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:03.640]   And at any point, it doesn't matter where he starts, he can use that to bring us to
[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:04.640]   the center.
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:07.560]   If we won't listen to the preaching of the gospel, well, perhaps you will listen when
[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:11.560]   you're put flat on your back in bed and can't move, and are cut off from all the things
[00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:13.020]   that keep you going.
[00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:17.680]   He does that kind of thing, indirect method.
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:21.560]   Things that don't seem to be directly spiritual at first.
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:25.800]   But he'll lead you on until you come to this vital point.
[00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:29.640]   All I'm saying is this.
[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:32.860]   Be ready always to hear him.
[00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:38.520]   Be ready to find him anywhere, for him to find you at any given point.
[00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:41.360]   You mustn't stereotype these things.
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:46.080]   You mustn't work these things out into steps or a technique or a given rule.
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:47.880]   No, no, he doesn't work like that.
[00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:52.320]   He's the Lord of Creation, and he varies in his methods as much as he does in the color
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:55.160]   of the flowers and all these other things.
[00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:59.440]   So watch his method, and especially this indirect method.
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:05.720]   But then, the next thing we notice is the way in which he aroused the interest and the
[00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:11.880]   curiosity of this woman, in the way that I've been indicating, this indirect way.
[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:14.040]   But that's what he's doing.
[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:15.920]   He's puzzling her.
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:17.720]   He's making her curious.
[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:20.120]   She's never met anything like this before.
[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:21.120]   What's he doing?
[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:23.000]   Oh, what he's doing is this.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.440]   He's leading on to this great central thing.
[00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:28.160]   That's the thing that he wants.
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:33.760]   But he does it in this way, by arousing interest, creating curiosity.
[00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:36.520]   And he still does this.
[00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:39.320]   Creates desires and longings within us.
[00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:40.800]   We can't understand them.
[00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:42.360]   We don't know why we have them.
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:44.600]   But that's the way in which he deals with us.
[00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:48.720]   He'll make you read a book, which you've never heard of.
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:50.040]   He'll lead you to it.
[00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:54.000]   He'll somehow put it before you, in a most amazing manner.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.880]   Seems to be accidental, but it isn't accidental.
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:59.880]   He puts things in our way.
[00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:03.360]   Or he stops certain things, or he suggests certain things.
[00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:04.360]   Things happen to us.
[00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:09.200]   And all along, he's arousing our curiosity.
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:11.600]   What is this?
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:12.600]   What is this thing?
[00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:16.240]   You'll read a biography of a saint, and you'll say, "Well, is this Christianity?"
[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:19.280]   Well, if it is, I haven't got this.
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:22.480]   But if it is, well, then I ought to be concerned about this.
[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:23.960]   I ought to be enjoying this.
[00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:25.920]   I ought to be experiencing this.
[00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:33.920]   And so, he creates your desires for this within you, and longings and aspirations.
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:38.040]   And it can happen in a thousand and one different ways.
[00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:42.360]   Oh, I'm simply asking a question at this point.
[00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:49.040]   Has he aroused a longing in you for this well of water?
[00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:52.800]   Is there a dissatisfaction, a spiritual dissatisfaction?
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:54.840]   Do you know anything about it?
[00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:59.440]   Or are you perfectly at ease and content, feeling you've got it, got everything, know
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:00.760]   it all?
[00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:10.120]   Or, when he deals with you, he'll go on arousing this curiosity, this desire, this longing
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:12.920]   for something you've never hitherto known.
[00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:20.960]   It's a sure sign that he is dealing with you, a dis-ease, a lack of satisfaction, but some
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:26.400]   vague, perhaps, at first, longing for something that you hitherto have not known.
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:33.280]   And so, you see, it brings me to my next point, which is that he leads us on from step to
[00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:34.280]   step.
[00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:40.080]   This is a great characteristic of his method, all of us.
[00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:41.080]   Watch it in this story.
[00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:43.560]   There's a kind of sequence.
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:46.360]   He knows what he's doing from the very beginning.
[00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:50.040]   When he starts right over there, he knows he's going to end there, and he brings us
[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:54.800]   step to step, stage to stage.
[00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:58.840]   You see, this is a principle that is put in the epistle to the Hebrews in the first verse
[00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:02.480]   of chapter 6 by saying, "Let us go on to perfection."
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:04.240]   Go on.
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:08.960]   The Christian life is a life of growth, it's a life of development.
[00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:13.360]   You don't remain as you were when you were born, you're a baby in Christ, but you grow.
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:16.920]   You grow in grace and in the knowledge of the Lord.
[00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:18.520]   It's an increasingly progressing life.
[00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:24.000]   Well, the water springing up goes on springing forever and ever into everlasting life.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.600]   There is a development.
[00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:33.680]   You remember the Apostle Paul, at the height of his great experience as a Christian, writing
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:38.360]   in the third chapter of the epistle to the Philippians.
[00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:45.360]   He's given an account of how he'd been delivered from his old state and condition as a Jew,
[00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:49.440]   and he says, "The thing he rejoices is that he's found in him not having mine own righteousness
[00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:53.260]   which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which
[00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:55.120]   is of God by faith.
[00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:56.120]   But he's not satisfied.
[00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:57.120]   What does he want?
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:59.600]   What's his greatest longing and desire?
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:03.240]   It is this, that I may know him."
[00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:05.120]   But he did know him, I know.
[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:08.680]   It's because he knows him, he wants to know more of him and to know him better.
[00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:14.080]   And the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable
[00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:20.040]   unto his death, if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection from amongst the dead,
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:23.240]   I believe that's final spiritual perfection.
[00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:29.840]   Then he adds, this is the thing, "Not as though I had already attained, either were already
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:30.840]   perfect."
[00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:35.720]   He knows he's saved, he knows he's forgiven, he knows he's regenerate, but he hasn't fully
[00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:37.600]   attained yet unto perfection.
[00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:44.800]   Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect, but I follow after,
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:45.800]   follow after.
[00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:47.480]   There's one leading him and he's following him.
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:55.280]   "If that I may apprehend that for which also I am, I have been apprehended by Christ Jesus.
[00:23:55.280 --> 00:24:01.000]   Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended in all its fullness, of course not.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.560]   Who can get a full comprehension of this?
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:10.060]   But I, this one thing I do for getting those things which are behind and reaching forth
[00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:14.600]   unto these things which are before, I press toward the mark for the prize of the high
[00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:16.800]   calling of God in Christ Jesus.
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:20.200]   He presses toward the mark because he's being pressed.
[00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:25.080]   He's already said it in the second chapter in these words, "Wherefore my beloved, as
[00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:29.600]   he have always obeyed not as in my presence only, but now much more as in my absence,
[00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:35.680]   work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God that worketh in you,
[00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:39.960]   both the will and to do of his good pleasure."
[00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:45.760]   Very well then, here I say is something that is always true of his method.
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:48.560]   He leads us on.
[00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:50.880]   Are you progressing?
[00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:55.440]   Do you know more about him and about these things than you did a year ago?
[00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:57.000]   He always leads us on.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.320]   He's never static.
[00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:01.800]   There are always deeper depths.
[00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:03.880]   There are always richer glories.
[00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:09.560]   Oh, to me there's nothing more pathetic than to find an old Christian who's always talking
[00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:15.160]   about his conversion and stops at that, as if nothing had happened after that.
[00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:17.520]   That is to me the most tragic thing of all.
[00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:23.080]   It seems to violate this great glorious principle, the growth, the development, the being led
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:29.120]   on by the Son of God until we reach the absolute perfection.
[00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:34.880]   Then notice and thank God for this, his wonderful patience.
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:38.600]   Wasn't he patient with this woman?
[00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:43.480]   Don't we all feel rebuked as we read the story?
[00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:48.000]   Woken up with her interjections, remarks, her cleverness, her glibness, her debating
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:54.360]   points, still patient, suffers it all.
[00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:58.280]   We might spend our whole morning on that.
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:04.360]   None of us would be here were it not for the patience of God and the patience of the Lord
[00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:05.960]   Jesus Christ.
[00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:11.840]   You read in the Old Testament, "Now God was so patient and longsuffering with his ancient
[00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:12.840]   people.
[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:16.080]   They suffered their evil manners.
[00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:18.800]   They insulted him.
[00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:20.800]   They spat upon his law.
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:25.080]   They turned to the gods of the nations, the foolish people.
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:27.960]   But he didn't block them out of his book.
[00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:29.920]   They turned back to him when they were in trouble.
[00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:34.120]   Of course they did, the cowards, the cads.
[00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:37.080]   And we're all so like them.
[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:44.520]   But his loving kindness and his longsuffering and his patience never fail.
[00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:47.160]   And you see it here with this woman.
[00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:52.240]   His patience with her, his tolerance, it's all right.
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:55.640]   You see it's based upon his knowledge, upon his power.
[00:26:55.640 --> 00:27:00.080]   He knows the end, so he's patient with us.
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:01.080]   He knows our condition.
[00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:03.420]   That's why he came into the world.
[00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:07.340]   He knows what man in sin is like in a way that we'll never know.
[00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:10.620]   We know something about it, but we don't know it in its depths.
[00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:17.620]   He sees what other victims we are of the devil and his powers and his influences.
[00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:21.100]   And so he knows that he's got to be patient with us.
[00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:25.940]   I say again, he doesn't bludgeon us or dragoon us, but he adopts this method and he's so
[00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:30.420]   loving and patient with us in order that he may bring us to that desired end.
[00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:34.820]   But the last point I would make concerning his method, and it stands out here again so
[00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:38.620]   prominently as this, his perseverance.
[00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:47.180]   He's not only patient, but because he is in charge, his patience assumes the form of perseverance
[00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:48.420]   and it leads to it.
[00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:54.100]   Indeed, the patience is based upon, as I say, the perseverance, his knowledge of the end.
[00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:57.900]   In other words, read the story again for yourselves and watch this.
[00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:02.260]   How our Lord will not be sidetracked.
[00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:05.620]   The woman tried it several times over, but he won't have it.
[00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:07.980]   He will not be sidetracked.
[00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:15.060]   He keeps on, he persists until eventually he's got her to face the vital question.
[00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:20.140]   And my dear friends, it is still the same.
[00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:26.500]   I say once more, as I said earlier, he will not let us go.
[00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:28.820]   He wouldn't let this woman go.
[00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:30.380]   She wriggled, she tried her best.
[00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:32.060]   Now, he will not let her go.
[00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:33.340]   He perseveres.
[00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:38.500]   I say again, this is our only hope.
[00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:43.300]   If it were not for his perseverance, there'd be no such thing as the final perseverance
[00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:44.540]   of the saints.
[00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:48.740]   If it were left to us, we would all fail, every one of us.
[00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:49.740]   We have failed.
[00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:50.740]   How often?
[00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:51.740]   We all know.
[00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:56.860]   Our only hope this morning is his perseverance.
[00:28:56.860 --> 00:29:03.900]   Paul says to the Ephesians in the second chapter, verse 10, "We are his workmanship, created
[00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:07.660]   anew in Christ Jesus."
[00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:10.620]   Some say that the original picture there is "We are his poem."
[00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:12.180]   All right, take it like that.
[00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:17.300]   Or if you prefer to think of it in terms of a potter making some beautiful vase or something,
[00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:19.140]   it's equally good as a picture.
[00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:25.460]   But the point in both cases is this, that he is the author, he is the artist, he is
[00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:30.100]   the maker, he is the moron, his workmanship.
[00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:35.860]   This is, I say, not only our final comfort, it is our only hope.
[00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:40.420]   He never leaves his work undone or unfinished.
[00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:42.300]   He cannot do that.
[00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:45.360]   He would deny himself if he did.
[00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:47.100]   He is God, the Son.
[00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:48.560]   He is perfect.
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:52.780]   We start things and we leave them, or we leave them in an imperfect condition.
[00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:53.940]   He never does that.
[00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:54.980]   He cannot do that.
[00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:56.780]   He will not do that.
[00:29:56.780 --> 00:30:02.220]   He made the world perfect, and the regeneration is going to be perfect.
[00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:08.660]   So I say, you see it all here, and this is what stands out here, the way he persisted
[00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:14.340]   and persevered with this woman until he brings her to that desired end.
[00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:19.140]   You see, the apostle Paul again puts it to the Philippians, in Philippians 1, 6.
[00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:25.260]   Here he is, he's an old man, he's in prison, he's hearing rumors that the emperor Nero
[00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:27.220]   may put him to death at any moment.
[00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:28.980]   He doesn't know.
[00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:31.700]   But he thinks of the little church in Philippi.
[00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:37.380]   And there were quarrels and disputings there, and you would imagine that he was in the depth
[00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:39.340]   of depression, but he wasn't.
[00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:45.380]   This is what he says, "Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun
[00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:55.100]   good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ."
[00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:57.100]   That's the rock on which we stand.
[00:30:57.100 --> 00:31:06.140]   "Yes," says Jude, "unto him who is able to keep us from falling, and to present us faultless
[00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:10.900]   before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy."
[00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:17.780]   My friends, God says in his prophecy concerning this great salvation that was to come through
[00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:25.220]   his Son, "I have loved you with an everlasting love," not a temporary love.
[00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:30.620]   "Mine is an unchanging love," says the poet so rightly.
[00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:33.900]   It is an unchanging love.
[00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:40.100]   Higher than the heights above, deeper than the depths beneath.
[00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:44.820]   It's changeless, it's absolute, it's eternal.
[00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:49.220]   Well, you remember how Paul puts it in Romans 8.30.
[00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:52.620]   This is it, this is the perseverance.
[00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:56.060]   And it's the perseverance of God, the perseverance of Christ.
[00:31:56.060 --> 00:32:03.860]   Moreover, listen to this logic, "Moreover, whom he did predestinate, them he also called,
[00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:11.500]   and whom he called, them he also justified; and whom he justified, them he also glorified."
[00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:14.060]   But you see, we are not yet glorified.
[00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:18.020]   I know we are not in actual practice, but in the mind and the purpose and the plan of
[00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:21.020]   God we are already glorified.
[00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:24.740]   And if you are a Christian at all, you will be glorified.
[00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:25.740]   Why?
[00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:31.820]   Well, the end of the chapter tells us, verses 38 and 39 of Romans 8, "I am persuaded,"
[00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:39.500]   which means I am absolutely certain, "that neither death nor life, nor angels, nor principalities,
[00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:45.020]   nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other
[00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:51.100]   creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our
[00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:52.100]   Lord."
[00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:58.260]   Nothing can, nothing shall ever be able to separate us from the love of God.
[00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:04.260]   His perseverance, he will not let us go.
[00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:12.020]   The work which is goodness began, the arm of his strength will complete.
[00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:19.180]   His promise is "Yea, and Amen," and never was forfeited yet.
[00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:25.060]   Things future, nor things that are now, nor all things below nor above, can make him,
[00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:31.420]   his purpose forgo or sever my soul from his love.
[00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:35.580]   He persevered with this woman until he had given her the gift.
[00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:42.140]   He will persevere with us until we are faultless and blameless and spotless in the presence
[00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:45.060]   of God, in the glory everlasting.
[00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:51.540]   I say once more, as I said at the beginning of this study of his method, be careful my
[00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:54.180]   dear friend.
[00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:59.980]   If he has started a good work in you, he will complete it.
[00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:03.300]   You may rebel, you'll suffer if you do.
[00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:08.260]   You may fight against him, you're only bringing trouble upon yourself.
[00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:11.020]   You say, "But I want a bit of pleasure in the world, I'm young."
[00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:14.180]   All right, you go after it, you pay for it.
[00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:20.280]   If he has started a good work in you, he will finish it.
[00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:27.140]   You try to remodel this mold, you'll only be inviting the chisel and the hammer.
[00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:33.260]   And he'll go on with his work until he has brought you to that ultimate, that final perfection.
[00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:39.420]   Oh, my dear friends, let's learn these lessons as we thus just look in general at our Lord's
[00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:41.460]   dealing with the woman of Samaria.
[00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:45.420]   There, I say, is the foundation of all our hope.
[00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:48.740]   What hope would there be for the Christian church this morning if it were not the church
[00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:49.740]   of God?
[00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:52.060]   Look what men have done to her in the past centuries.
[00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:54.260]   Look what they're trying to do with her now.
[00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:55.260]   Look what's happening.
[00:34:55.260 --> 00:35:02.820]   The whole thing would be completely hopeless were it not that it is His church and His
[00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:05.380]   purposes are forever sure.
[00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:09.740]   Whatever the position may be today, I know the ultimate is guaranteed.
[00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:11.500]   It's absolutely sure.
[00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:16.220]   And though everything seems to be going the other way at the moment, that is going to
[00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:17.220]   end in destruction.
[00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:23.820]   And whoever small the company of the faithful people of God may be, it's all right.
[00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:27.020]   They shall shine as the sun.
[00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:35.220]   They'll reflect the glory of God, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, His perseverance.
[00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:36.220]   It's all here.
[00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:42.220]   Well, now then, having looked, you see, at the ultimate and at the guarantee of it all,
[00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:47.020]   the next step we come to is this one, the hindrances.
[00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:49.020]   Here's the goal.
[00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:54.260]   "Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst, but the
[00:35:54.260 --> 00:36:01.580]   water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water, springing up into everlasting
[00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:02.580]   life."
[00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:03.580]   Have you got it?
[00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:04.580]   Do you know about it?
[00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:06.340]   If not, why not?
[00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:10.500]   Well, it's because of hindrances.
[00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:12.260]   And the point I'm making is this.
[00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:16.740]   The hindrances are entirely of our making.
[00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:21.620]   That's one of the great lessons of this story.
[00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:28.340]   Look at this poor woman, the great offer, and the hindrances and the difficulties and
[00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:34.140]   the obstacles that she creates and raises, spiting herself, standing in her own light,
[00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:36.540]   robbing herself of this great gift.
[00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:40.580]   All the hindrances, and there are many here, we've got to deal with them, because the
[00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:45.900]   things that hinder this woman are the things that are still hindering God's people.
[00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:47.940]   And it is a vital part of this teaching.
[00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:52.140]   It's no use my just standing here and say, "Here is this well of water.
[00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:53.140]   Have you got it?"
[00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:56.860]   I've got to face the question, "If we haven't got it, why haven't we got it?"
[00:36:56.860 --> 00:37:00.740]   And I've got to deal with them as our Lord dealt with them in the case of this woman.
[00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:01.780]   He still does that.
[00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:02.780]   He does it through preaching.
[00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:04.140]   He does it through the scriptures.
[00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:06.220]   He does it in many other ways.
[00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:07.580]   What are these hindrances?
[00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:15.140]   Well, notice some of them immediately, obviously on the surface, general prejudices.
[00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:23.580]   Look at this woman with her prejudice about Jews and Samaritans, male and female, and
[00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:27.860]   with regard to worship, which I'm going to deal with on its own.
[00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:33.780]   But you may say, "Ah, yes, you see, that's why you're wrong in taking it as you are,
[00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:36.260]   instead of taking it evangelistically.
[00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:41.140]   The moment we become Christians, we no longer are troubled by these questions of Jews and
[00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:42.940]   Samaritans and so on."
[00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:44.980]   Is that so?
[00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:49.700]   Are you so much of a tyrant in the spiritual life that you haven't yet realized that many
[00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:54.380]   of these old prejudices follow us into the Christian life?
[00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:58.220]   But you say, "If any man be in Christ Jesus, he is a new creature.
[00:37:58.220 --> 00:37:59.700]   All things are passed away.
[00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:02.700]   Behold, all things have become new."
[00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:10.180]   Does that mean that you therefore are an entirely different person in every shape and form?
[00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:11.900]   Of course it doesn't.
[00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:14.780]   That's just an abuse of Scripture.
[00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:20.580]   We've got to learn that we carry prejudices from the old life with us into the new life.
[00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:21.900]   Now, this isn't my opinion.
[00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:22.900]   Let me prove it to you.
[00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:23.900]   Look at the Corinthians.
[00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:26.140]   Look at the church at Corinth.
[00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:29.420]   Look at those early chapters.
[00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:35.180]   Paul there has to deal with this question of human, earthly, worldly wisdom.
[00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:36.180]   Why?
[00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:41.180]   Well, because the members of the church at Corinth were beginning to bring that in.
[00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:42.180]   They'd been converted.
[00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:45.340]   They were truly Christian, born again.
[00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:49.060]   But they're now beginning to look at the cross in a philosophic manner.
[00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:52.500]   And Paul says, "If you do that, you are making it of none effect."
[00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:54.020]   And he has that great argument.
[00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:55.860]   But here's the material question.
[00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:58.140]   Why were the Corinthians doing that?
[00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:00.380]   And there's only one answer.
[00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:02.580]   Because they were Corinthians.
[00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:04.260]   Because they were Greeks.
[00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:06.660]   Because that was their background.
[00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:09.500]   It was the thing of which they bursted in that country.
[00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:12.980]   Philosophy, understanding, reason.
[00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:16.140]   And though they're in the Christian life, it traps them.
[00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:19.060]   And Paul has great difficulty with them, and great trouble.
[00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:21.500]   There's one example straight away.
[00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:25.660]   They had brought with them the old prejudice, and his argument with them is this.
[00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:28.740]   If you say that, he says, "You're reverting to the old method of thinking.
[00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:30.900]   You've gone back to your old position.
[00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:33.460]   You're still behaving as Greeks instead of as Christians."
[00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:39.100]   But of course, the same thing is equally true of the Jews.
[00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:41.220]   See them stumbling.
[00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:46.740]   Even the apostle Peter, he stumbled over the question of going down to preach in the house
[00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:47.740]   of Cornelius.
[00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:49.740]   It took a vision to open his eyes.
[00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:52.980]   Peter, he's not only born again, he's passed through Pentecost.
[00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:57.300]   But the old Jewish prejudice is still there.
[00:39:57.300 --> 00:40:04.100]   And do you remember how Paul tells us in Galatians 2 how at Antioch, later, Peter began to dissimulate.
[00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:08.540]   You see, you don't finish with the past.
[00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:11.020]   The old prejudice still tend to follow us in.
[00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:14.900]   And the epistle to the Hebrews would never have been written were it not that they were
[00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:16.220]   Hebrews.
[00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:22.820]   And they again were tending to carry with them these old prejudices into the Christian
[00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:23.820]   life.
[00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:27.140]   You don't get rid of all your problems the moment you become a Christian.
[00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:30.380]   I know evangelists sometimes give that impression to get results.
[00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:31.380]   It isn't true.
[00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:32.380]   It's misleading.
[00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:35.060]   And that's why many people drop off or are disappointed.
[00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:36.060]   No, no.
[00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:39.300]   You've got to take the position as it is put in the scriptures.
[00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:44.300]   And you'll find, therefore, that many prejudices tend to carry over into the Christian life
[00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:47.540]   and they can stand between us in this great blessing.
[00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:48.540]   What are they?
[00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:50.540]   Well, even nationality.
[00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:51.540]   Even nationality.
[00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:56.020]   And we've all got to bear this in mind.
[00:40:56.020 --> 00:41:02.720]   I said to a man this last week, a thing I've often said, "What is the place of nationality
[00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:06.040]   in Christianity, in the spiritual life?
[00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:09.500]   What a problem, what a question that is."
[00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:13.620]   It's very interesting if you read the history of the church and the theological debates
[00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:19.460]   and so on, to notice this influence creeping in.
[00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:25.260]   There is, of course, an essential difference in this matter between, say, an Englishman
[00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:28.140]   and a Scotsman.
[00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:32.780]   It is said that the Scots have theology in their bones and in their blood.
[00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:34.780]   Their history seems to indicate that.
[00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:40.580]   But they're very different from the English, who is an empiricist by nature, doesn't like
[00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:44.860]   definitions, doesn't like too much reason.
[00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:51.100]   Now you don't finish with that kind of national background and prejudice in your makeup when
[00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:52.100]   you become a Christian.
[00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:53.100]   Now look at the Germans.
[00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:56.420]   They're delighting words.
[00:41:56.420 --> 00:42:00.580]   It's so characteristic of all their theology, German theology.
[00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:03.940]   The French outlook is a very different one.
[00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:07.820]   The Latin outlook, the Latin racism, their outlook, all these things are different.
[00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:10.780]   Now this, of course, can be exaggerated.
[00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:12.260]   Men have made too much of it.
[00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:16.460]   I think I've told you once before how I once read a book by a man, and this was the whole
[00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:18.820]   thesis of the book.
[00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:24.580]   He said that you could explain whether people were Protestant, Reformed, Calvinistic in
[00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:29.780]   their doctrine, or Catholic in their doctrine, purely in terms of climate.
[00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:33.300]   The further south, the nearer you go to the equator, he said, the more likely it's to
[00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:34.300]   be Catholic.
[00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:37.300]   The colder regions, it's harder, Calvinistic.
[00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:39.660]   That was his whole explanation.
[00:42:39.660 --> 00:42:46.500]   And therefore it was not surprising that Calvinism came from John Calvin, who lived in Geneva.
[00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:49.260]   He'd quite forgotten that Calvin was a Frenchman.
[00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:57.300]   However, I'm just showing you by illustration that these things tend to persist and to follow
[00:42:57.300 --> 00:42:58.580]   us.
[00:42:58.580 --> 00:43:02.180]   You don't get rid of this problem by saying, "Ah, that woman was unconverted."
[00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:05.740]   And of course, while you're unconverted, you're full of these prejudices.
[00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:07.700]   Examine yourself, my friend.
[00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:11.100]   We've all got to examine ourselves.
[00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:17.500]   To what extent are we allowing these prejudices to influence us and to govern us?
[00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:25.780]   Not only nationality, but traditions and customs, the way in which we've been brought up, our
[00:43:25.780 --> 00:43:26.780]   background.
[00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:29.380]   Now, haven't you known this?
[00:43:29.380 --> 00:43:34.100]   Haven't you found this in your spiritual experience?
[00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:39.700]   That there is often a very great difference between two Christian people, one of whom
[00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:44.500]   has been brought up, as it were, in a church or a chapel, in a religious home, religious
[00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:47.420]   family, always familiar with these things.
[00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:51.440]   There's one person now converted, born again, a true Christian.
[00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:56.260]   But here's another one, who comes from an entirely pagan atmosphere, no background at
[00:43:56.260 --> 00:43:59.900]   all, but also converted, born again.
[00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:07.180]   Here are two Christians, but you will find that their problems are often very different,
[00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:09.340]   very different indeed.
[00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:14.420]   The first one has more to shed than the second one, much more.
[00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:18.380]   The problem of one who has sort of always been brought up to these things and has always
[00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:23.100]   regarded himself and herself as a Christian, the problem for that person is often much
[00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:25.780]   greater than that of the other.
[00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:28.460]   In a final sense, of course, there is no difference.
[00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:33.540]   All I'm showing is that the devil makes use of these things and the prejudices.
[00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:35.420]   It will keep on creeping back.
[00:44:35.420 --> 00:44:39.700]   The reliance upon your works, upon your goodness, upon your attendance at the house of God,
[00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:41.460]   your saying of your prayers.
[00:44:41.460 --> 00:44:45.880]   The tendency of such a person always is to fall back onto works in a way that the other
[00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:50.940]   one cannot because he or she has never held that view, knew nothing at all about it.
[00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:53.940]   But these are the things.
[00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:55.740]   Prejudices.
[00:44:55.740 --> 00:44:59.580]   There's a common prejudice in this country as to what Christianity is, and it's very
[00:44:59.580 --> 00:45:01.860]   difficult to shake yourselves from it.
[00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:02.860]   Christian country.
[00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:03.860]   It's there.
[00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:10.540]   It keeps on seeping in, and people have to fight against this.
[00:45:10.540 --> 00:45:16.060]   Or a form, a particular type of worship, or a particular religious habit or custom.
[00:45:16.060 --> 00:45:17.060]   These are the things.
[00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:19.340]   Now, you don't shed them completely.
[00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:23.580]   They don't drop off altogether the moment you come into the Christian life.
[00:45:23.580 --> 00:45:29.660]   And these do constitute at times some of the greatest difficulties and problems.
[00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:32.540]   People say, "What are you talking about, this well of water?
[00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:36.220]   I've always been a Christian, or I've been a Christian for so long, ever since I was
[00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:37.220]   a child.
[00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:39.220]   Look here, what do you mean by this?"
[00:45:39.220 --> 00:45:43.140]   They don't quite like it at first.
[00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:49.260]   I received a letter only this last week, if I may use this as an illustration as I close.
[00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:53.820]   I received a letter from some friends in the north of England whom I don't know and I've
[00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:56.420]   never seen as far as I know.
[00:45:56.420 --> 00:45:58.980]   Men and wife writing to me together.
[00:45:58.980 --> 00:46:07.500]   I've had some bit of help from something that they'd read which I'd been privileged to write.
[00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:10.120]   But this is what interested me.
[00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:14.820]   They said at first we didn't like it.
[00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:16.940]   We were annoyed by it.
[00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:18.140]   That's their term, not mine.
[00:46:18.140 --> 00:46:19.620]   They were annoyed by it.
[00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:21.420]   Why were they annoyed by it?
[00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:24.060]   Ah, because of this prejudice.
[00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:28.540]   They'd been brought up in a certain way, the way I've actually been describing.
[00:46:28.540 --> 00:46:31.740]   And the first reaction was one of annoyance.
[00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:32.740]   What's this man saying?
[00:46:32.740 --> 00:46:35.020]   Is he suggesting we are not Christians?
[00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:37.020]   But we are Christians.
[00:46:37.020 --> 00:46:39.260]   And so you see, you put up a barrier.
[00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:40.660]   The Lord is speaking to you.
[00:46:40.660 --> 00:46:44.260]   He's offering you this which you haven't got, that you'll never thirst again, the well of
[00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:45.260]   water.
[00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:46.260]   But you put up an obstacle.
[00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:47.260]   You say, "What is this?"
[00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:48.260]   You remember the Jews?
[00:46:48.260 --> 00:46:53.260]   It's all there in the eighth chapter of this Gospel according to St. John.
[00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:57.100]   "Our Lord had been preaching and we are told that when he said these things many believed
[00:46:57.100 --> 00:46:58.100]   on his name.
[00:46:58.100 --> 00:47:03.060]   Then he looked at them and said, 'If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed,
[00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:05.860]   and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.'"
[00:47:05.860 --> 00:47:07.380]   What a wonderful promise.
[00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:08.380]   You remember the reaction?
[00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:14.740]   "Then said the Jews unto him, 'We be Abraham's seed, and we're never in bondage to any men.
[00:47:14.740 --> 00:47:18.420]   How sayest thou, 'Ye shall be made free?'"
[00:47:18.420 --> 00:47:22.460]   See the prejudice?
[00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:25.540]   There's nothing more terrible than that.
[00:47:25.540 --> 00:47:32.380]   That we allow some old prejudice, some general prejudice, so to influence us.
[00:47:32.380 --> 00:47:39.580]   That at first, far from accepting this gracious, loving offer, we even resent it, because it
[00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:44.140]   carries the implication and the suggestion that we are not everything that we ought to
[00:47:44.140 --> 00:47:45.140]   be.
[00:47:45.140 --> 00:47:47.580]   God have mercy upon us.
[00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:54.340]   Let's learn the lessons that we find here enshrined in this old story of our Lord dealing
[00:47:54.340 --> 00:47:56.340]   with a woman of Samaria.
[00:47:56.340 --> 00:48:00.220]   We raise the obstacles, and I'm only beginning on this.
[00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:09.380]   Thank God he perseveres and is patient with us, and is determined to bring us to the desired
[00:48:09.380 --> 00:48:10.380]   end.
[00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:17.620]   Now let us sing our closing hymn, which is number 429.
[00:48:17.620 --> 00:48:26.700]   "Jesus, my Lord, my God, my all, hear me, blessed Savior, when I call."
[00:48:26.700 --> 00:48:28.060]   429.
[00:48:28.060 --> 00:48:56.700]   "Jesus, my Lord, my God, my all, hear me, blessed Savior, when I call."
[00:48:56.700 --> 00:48:59.140]   429.
[00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:15.220]   "Jesus, my Lord, my God, my all, hear me, blessed Savior, when I call."
[00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:19.140]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
