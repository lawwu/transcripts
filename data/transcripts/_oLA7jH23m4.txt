[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (gentle music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:12.820]   - You mentioned the idea of out, outtelligence.
[00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.040]   - Artificial outtelligence.
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.240]   - Artificial outtelligence.
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.060]   The idea is quite compelling, it's quite unique and new,
[00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.360]   and at least from my view, a stance point.
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.440]   Maybe you can explain it.
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.280]   - Sure.
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.320]   What I was thinking about is why it is
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.040]   that we're waiting to be terrified by artificial
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.080]   general intelligence when in fact artificial life
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:39.120]   is terrifying in and of itself and it's already here.
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.400]   So in order to have a system of selective pressures,
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.800]   you need three distinct elements.
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.920]   You need variation within a population,
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.060]   you need heritability, and you need differential success.
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.240]   So what's really unique about software is that
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.480]   if you think about what humans know how to build,
[00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.320]   that's impressive.
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.360]   So I always take a car and I say,
[00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.320]   does it have an analog of each of the physiological systems?
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.680]   Does it have a skeletal structure, that's its frame.
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.120]   Does it have a neurological structure,
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.540]   has an onboard computer, has a digestive system?
[00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.240]   The one thing it doesn't have is a reproductive system.
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.760]   But if you can call spawn on a process,
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.060]   effectively you do have a reproductive system.
[00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.520]   And that means that you can create something
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.200]   with variation, heritability, and differential success.
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.360]   Now, the next step in the chain of thinking was
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.360]   where do we see inanimate, non-intelligent life,
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.160]   outwitting intelligent life?
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.600]   And I have two favorite systems
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.720]   and I try to stay on them so that we don't get distracted.
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.200]   One of which is the Ophrys orchid subspecies,
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.600]   or subclade, I don't know what to call it.
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.480]   - Is it a type of flower?
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.320]   - Yeah, it's a type of flower that mimics the female
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.200]   of a pollinator species in order to dupe the males
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.400]   into engaging, it was called pseudocopulation,
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.240]   with the fake female, which is usually represented
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.080]   by the lowest petal.
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.920]   And there's also a pheromone component
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.240]   to fool the males into thinking
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.340]   they have a mating opportunity.
[00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.060]   But the flower doesn't have to give up energy
[00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.000]   in the form of nectar as a lure
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.600]   because it's tricking the males.
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:30.640]   The other system is a particular species of mussel,
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.320]   Lampicillus in the clear streams of Missouri.
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:40.240]   And it fools bass into biting a fleshy lip
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.040]   that contain its young.
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.160]   And when the bass see this fleshy lip,
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.340]   which looks exactly like a species of fish
[00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.220]   that the bass like to eat,
[00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.600]   the young explode and clamp onto the gills
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.040]   and parasitize the bass and also use the bass
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.700]   to redistribute them as they eventually release.
[00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:04.800]   Both of these systems, you have a highly intelligent dupe
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.540]   being fooled by a lower life form.
[00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.900]   And what is sculpting these convincing lures?
[00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.840]   It's the intelligence of previously duped targets
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.800]   for these strategies.
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.120]   So when the target is smart enough to avoid the strategy,
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.800]   those weaker mimics fall off.
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.080]   They have terminal lines and only the better ones survive.
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.940]   So it's an arms race between the target species
[00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.240]   that is being parasitized, getting smarter,
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:46.240]   and this other less intelligent or non-intelligent object
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.440]   getting as if smarter.
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:54.180]   And so what you see is that artificial general intelligence
[00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.480]   is not needed to parasitize us.
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.420]   It's simply sufficient for us to outwit ourselves.
[00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.540]   So you could have a program, let's say,
[00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.580]   one of these Nigerian scams that writes letters
[00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.700]   and uses whoever sends it Bitcoin
[00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.140]   to figure out which aspects of the program should be kept,
[00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.180]   which should be varied and thrown away,
[00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.620]   and you don't need it to be in any way intelligent
[00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.860]   in order to have a really nightmarish scenario
[00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.340]   of being parasitized by something
[00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:26.980]   that has no idea what it's doing.
[00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.220]   (chuckles)
[00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.380]   (silence)
[00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.540]   (silence)
[00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.700]   (silence)
[00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.860]   (silence)
[00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.020]   (silence)
[00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.180]   (silence)
[00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.340]   (silence)
[00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:54.340]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
