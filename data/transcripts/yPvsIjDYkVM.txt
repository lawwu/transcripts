[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.680]   - Welcome everyone to Bogle Heads-On Investing podcast number 27.
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:20.960]   Today our special guest is Cliff Asness, founder, managing principal, and chief investment officer
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.760]   of AQR Capital Management.
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.680]   Cliff has a PhD from the University of Chicago.
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:39.020]   Jack Bogle called him a brilliant academic.
[00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.400]   My name is Rick Ferry and this is Bogle Heads-On Investing podcast number 27.
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.960]   This podcast, as with all podcasts, are brought to you by the John C. Bogle Center for Financial
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:57.760]   Literacy, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization at boglecenter.net.
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.680]   Today we have a special guest, Cliff Asness.
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.120]   Cliff is the founder, managing principal, and chief investment officer of AQR Capital
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.120]   Management.
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:13.960]   At the end of 2019, the firm was managing over $186 billion of assets, in part on strategies
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.480]   that Cliff developed at the University of Chicago as a PhD student under Nobel Laureate
[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.480]   Gene Fama.
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.360]   Cliff has received many awards, including the Bernstein-Fabozzi-Jacobs-Levy Award from
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.920]   the Journal of Portfolio Management, the Graham and Dodd Award from the Financial Analyst
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.800]   Journal, the James Verton Award from the CFA Institute, and probably his biggest award,
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.200]   Jack Bogle referred to Cliff Asness as a brilliant academic.
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.180]   I will warn you that some of this podcast is going to be a little geeky, so put on your
[00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.280]   math hat and here we go.
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.840]   With no further ado, let me introduce Cliff Asness.
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.840]   Welcome Dr. Asness.
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.440]   Thank you, Rick, but please call me Cliff.
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.840]   Doctor makes me think you want me to help with an appendectomy.
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.000]   Well, thank you, Cliff.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.300]   It's a real pleasure to have you on Bogle Heads on Investing.
[00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.560]   You have a lot of followers on the Bogle Heads.
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.920]   All of your research and your background is really quite fascinating.
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.960]   But that's what I want to start out with.
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:27.200]   If we could start as far back as you are comfortable going, how did you get to where you are today?
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.680]   I was a very unmotivated high school student.
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.400]   My parents thought I was an underachiever.
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.680]   I did very well on standardized tests and very poorly relative to those tests in classes.
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.800]   Partially, back then you can get away with actually not doing your homework and I took
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.940]   advantage of that.
[00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.360]   When applying to college, my dad found this program at the University of Pennsylvania
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:59.360]   that was a dual degree program between the Wharton School and the Engineering School.
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:05.200]   I had not really given any of this much thought at all and it was my father who suggested,
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.000]   "Hey, why don't you study two things that both could help with a career because you
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.800]   don't know what the heck you want to do and you have no direction."
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.860]   So I really didn't start out going to school and doing that because I had a great love
[00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.520]   of finance or really wanted to be a computer scientist.
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.440]   It was more of a default.
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.120]   I ended up loving both those things.
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.480]   Little luck is always a good thing.
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.360]   You got to take advantage of good luck when you get it.
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.440]   You got to minimize bad luck when you get it.
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.400]   But if things work out well and you don't acknowledge the role of luck, you're just
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.240]   not telling the truth.
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:44.880]   So I went to this program, at one point, I started doing research assistant work for
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.520]   a few different professors, one of which is quite well-known now, Andrew Lowe of MIT.
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.040]   He was at Wharton at the time.
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.560]   He was a very young man.
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:58.240]   I ended up enjoying even the research assistant work and I think I said something to him kind
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.720]   of like, "I might want to do what you do."
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:00.720]   He was like, "That's cool.
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.360]   Why don't you think about where you want to go, see where you get in."
[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:12.360]   I applied to a bunch of PhD programs, got in to Chicago, Stanford, and Wharton.
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.360]   Did not get into MIT, for which I'm still bitter about.
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:21.840]   But eventually, I'm on year 32 of being bitter about that.
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.560]   I think at some point I got to let it go, but I'm not quite there yet.
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.920]   They said something along the lines of, "We don't take people directly from undergrad,"
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.120]   but I think that was kind of like when someone breaks up with you and says, "It's not
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.120]   you.
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.120]   It's me."
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.680]   It probably wasn't because of your grades because according to the bio that I read,
[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.800]   you were a summa cum laude in both engineering and economics.
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:46.800]   Yeah.
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.120]   There was a day where I was pretty smart.
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:55.680]   That day has faded and I couldn't do any of those things again, but sometime in the
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.240]   distant past, the brain used to work.
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:03.160]   Let's not dwell on the one school I did not get in, though I will one day extract
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.440]   my revenge upon the entire institution.
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:13.400]   I ended up ... Wharton's a great place, but it didn't stack up against Chicago or Stanford
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.920]   when it came to PhD programs.
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:19.400]   I'm not talking, of course, about MBA programs or whatnot, but PhD programs always have their
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.440]   own kind of unique rankings.
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:28.120]   I basically went around to 10 professors at Wharton, told them that I'm looking to get
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.120]   a PhD in this.
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:35.880]   I got in these three schools and almost to a man, they said, "Shut the door," largely
[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.960]   because they were going to tell me not to go to Wharton.
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.360]   Again, no knock on Wharton.
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:45.640]   I love my alma mater, but that was how PhD programs ranked those days.
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:51.960]   Nine out of 10 told me to go to Chicago, and many of them had gone to Chicago themselves.
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:58.120]   One famous professor named Robert Litzenberger, who was the next Stanford professor, he suggested
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:03.920]   Stanford, but at that point in history, Chicago's where you want to be.
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:09.120]   As an aside, Chicago offered to fly me out, and Stanford didn't.
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.920]   I asked, and they said, "No, it's just not in the budget."
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:17.240]   I had no money at the time, so I took Chicago up on their offer, visited on one of the most
[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.400]   gorgeous spring days Chicago has ever produced.
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:25.280]   For years, I am fond of saying that I am the world's only person to choose Chicago over
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:31.240]   Stanford on the weather, which turned out to be a bit of a bait and switch, but the
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.480]   school worked out well.
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:41.720]   Not only did it work out well, but you got to study under some future Nobel laureates.
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:45.480]   One of them was Gene Fama.
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.840]   You know what's amazing?
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.160]   Back then, we pretty much knew he was a future Nobel laureate.
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:57.200]   Frankly, I thought they gave him the prize 15 years after they should have, but you knew
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.200]   it at the time.
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.200]   He was an amazing man.
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:05.320]   Again, it was a lucky break for me to be at Chicago in the late 1980s when Fama and French
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:12.440]   were doing a lot of the early work on what we now call systematic value investing or
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:13.440]   factor investing.
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:16.560]   We didn't even use those terms back then.
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:21.840]   We were just a bunch of geeks running regressions and sorting stocks on different variables,
[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.440]   looking at returns.
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:29.280]   The terminology came later, but I was lucky enough for Gene to ask me to be his teaching
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:34.360]   assistant at the end of the year, and I did that for two years, so it basically meant
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:40.280]   I kind of took his class three times, so I sat in on it pretty much every day for three
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:41.280]   years.
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:44.920]   I got to teach review sessions and got to know Gene.
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:49.520]   In PhD programs, getting good advisors, it's just a big part of it.
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:54.520]   Getting advisors who are interested in you, who think well of you, I think that work helped
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:08:00.360]   me get him and Ken French to co-chair my dissertation committee, which was quite wonderful.
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:01.360]   More luck.
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:05.560]   Professor Fama was a big efficient market guy, but your thesis really had nothing to
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:11.160]   do with efficient market or maybe almost to disprove efficient markets in some way.
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.640]   Oh, first of all, we never prove or disprove things.
[00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:14.640]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:15.640]   We're statisticians, so we're cowards.
[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:20.320]   I joke about the cowardly statisticians that we are.
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:21.320]   We don't disprove.
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:25.000]   We just say there's only a one out of 100 chance we're wrong.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.760]   Oh, that sounds like a Wall Street analyst there.
[00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:29.760]   Yeah.
[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:30.760]   Yeah.
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:31.760]   But it is.
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:32.760]   It's funny.
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:37.260]   It sounds kind of wimpy and cowardly, but it's also just intellectually true.
[00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:38.480]   Data can never prove something.
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:44.480]   It can just increase the probability of your hypothesis or against your hypothesis.
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:50.480]   If you see a 99 out of 100 event, it may be in fact that it's true, or maybe you've got
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:53.000]   a 99 out of 100 random event.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.720]   But yeah, a big part of my dissertation, not all of it, but a big part was one of the very
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:01.920]   early pieces of work, Price Momentum Strategy.
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:02.920]   Pride of Place is first.
[00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:09.160]   It has to go to Professors Jagadish and Tippmann, who wrote the first big published paper on
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:10.960]   the Price Momentum Strategy.
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:17.100]   I was fairly concurrent with them, and I am proud that my definition, partly because Fahman
[00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:22.760]   French adopted it for Ken French's kind of data website and used it in their papers.
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:30.600]   It's kind of the most common one people use today, UMD, up minus down, for basically one
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.400]   year price momentum.
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:39.200]   I do remember very, very distinctly being nervous about precisely what you just said,
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.200]   that here I am.
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:43.800]   I'm lucky to have this relationship with the premier advocate for the efficient markets
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:51.160]   hypothesis in the world, and I have all these preliminary results saying that a fairly straightforward
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:54.240]   momentum strategy was effective.
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:10:00.560]   I distinctly remember telling him, "Gene," and I say Gene now, "Professor Fahman," certainly
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:05.120]   it took me 15 years after the program until I would call him Gene, even though he kept
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:10.640]   telling me to, "Professor Fahman, I want to write a dissertation on price momentum,"
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:15.000]   and then I mumbled the second part out of fear, "And it works really well."
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   And he's like, "What?"
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.040]   I'm like, "And it works really well."
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:21.960]   And he thought for a bit, and he said something that has always stayed with me.
[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:26.040]   It was actually in a weird, geeky way, almost kind of moving.
[00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:31.840]   He said, "If it's in the data, write the paper," which to me said, "Look, this might not be
[00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:32.840]   something I love.
[00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:33.840]   I might not love this result.
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:39.400]   I might consider it the exception that proves the rule," but data's kind of holy to him,
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:45.080]   and that kind of stuck with me, and it also allowed me to get on the path to graduation,
[00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:46.080]   which was nice.
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:51.600]   Though even then I was not crazy enough to say, "Gee, I found something better than your
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:52.600]   value factor."
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.080]   First of all, that would have been bad economics.
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:01.160]   They work better, if you believe both of them, they work better together.
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:04.200]   Systematic value can make money over the long term.
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:08.720]   Systematic momentum can, and they're fairly negatively correlated, which is a wonderful
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:11.360]   thing to have if both strategies make money.
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:16.400]   It would have been bad graduation strategy to tell Fahman, "We're going to do this instead
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:21.800]   of value," saying, "It's a compliment to your wonderful value strategy," was some sucking
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:23.480]   up I was absolutely willing to do.
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:27.760]   >>Corey: Well, let me ask just a couple of questions on what you just said.
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:30.600]   Did Fahman ever call what he did "value investing"?
[00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:34.800]   >>David: It's funny you ask that, because I keep meaning to go back and check the original
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:35.800]   papers.
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:37.480]   I don't believe so.
[00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:42.060]   It's certainly possible when the world started calling it that, that they eventually referred
[00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:43.060]   to it that way.
[00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:48.360]   I don't even know that, but I don't remember them calling it a value factor or whatnot.
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:52.960]   I think that was index providers and maybe other papers that did it.
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:57.400]   I think they were just looking at multiples and whatnot to sort stocks.
[00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:02.120]   I could be dead wrong about this, but from memory, I don't remember being at Chicago
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:04.280]   and talking about value investing.
[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:10.280]   But certainly that label caught on, and I actually don't even think it's the best label.
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:16.200]   It creates tremendous confusion, because you're kind of Graham and Dodd, old-fashioned, concentrated
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:19.440]   portfolio, active management, value managers.
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:21.560]   People call themselves value managers.
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:27.240]   Get mad, because they look at the quantitative factor, and they say, "That's not value."
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:33.880]   Value is the price against fundamentals in consideration of things like which are better
[00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:39.520]   companies, safer companies, faster-growing companies, more profitable companies.
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:47.820]   The answer is quants don't think price divided by anything, books, sales, cash flow, earnings,
[00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:49.720]   is the only thing you should judge on.
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:54.760]   We agree with those managers, and we just call them different factors, things like the
[00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:59.480]   profitability factor, earnings momentum, low-risk investing.
[00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:03.720]   Those are all in the direction of the things that Graham and Dodd people want us to consider,
[00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:07.960]   but they just put the whole thing together and call a cheap company one that's cheap
[00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:10.000]   considering these other factors.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.720]   We break it up and call them other factors, and 1,000 fights have been caused by that
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:20.760]   when they're really, through very different methods, concentration versus diversification,
[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:23.960]   judgment versus systematic, but through very different methods.
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:28.360]   I think they're often looking for the same kind of things in the stocks.
[00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:32.120]   I always thought that beta can be agreed upon.
[00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:37.120]   You can take all the stocks on the market, weight them by either the shares outstanding
[00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:42.320]   in the public float or total shares outstanding, something, but we all can come to an agreement
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:50.960]   on what the beta of the market should be and that size, meaning large-cap stocks, mid-cap
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:57.040]   stocks, small-cap stocks, even micro-cap stocks, in general, all of the index providers can
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:01.480]   sort of agree what that is.
[00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:06.760]   They are all pretty close, but when it comes to value, I always say value is in the eyes
[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:08.440]   of the beholder.
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:09.640]   Everybody has a different equation.
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:10.640]   Sure.
[00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:16.600]   First, I think that's fair, but let's talk about the value factor, what I would prefer
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:21.160]   to call the price factor, not the holistic considering other aspects, just price divided
[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:23.560]   by some fundamental.
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:25.640]   You could choose price to cash flow.
[00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:27.880]   I could choose price to book.
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:33.640]   Someone else could choose a weighted average of how it looks on many different reasonable
[00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:35.660]   evaluation factors.
[00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:36.660]   You could do what we do.
[00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:44.960]   We wrote a paper on this in 1994 and tried to use this value factor to bet within industries,
[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:47.160]   meaning we don't think it's very effective across industries.
[00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:49.480]   It's pretty hard to compare valuations.
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:54.600]   The standard work in almost all of academia and a fair amount of the indices allows very
[00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:55.880]   large industry bets.
[00:14:55.880 --> 00:15:01.360]   In fact, it always strikes me that the way we invest in value, we try very hard not to
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:07.460]   take an industry bet, and the way many speak about value is only in terms of industry bets,
[00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:09.860]   tech versus textiles.
[00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:16.260]   All of these things make your value possibly different than my value, but if we both use
[00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:21.500]   a handful of reasonable measures and have a portfolio construction technique, I also
[00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:24.660]   didn't mention how you weight them, can be different.
[00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:26.620]   Fama and French is a cap weighted.
[00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:31.600]   You could do a signal weighted where the degree of the valuation signal tells you your position.
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:36.000]   You could do equal weight, and of course, those will have somewhat different results
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.920]   and have somewhat different degrees of implementability.
[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:39.920]   Is that a word?
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:41.880]   I think it's a word, implementability.
[00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:43.880]   Yeah, we'll call it a word.
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:44.880]   We'll call it.
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:45.880]   Yeah.
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:46.880]   It's our podcast.
[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:49.840]   We'll write a paper on that when you get off this podcast.
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:57.420]   With that said, I do think if you create your favorite value strategy, and it's reasonable,
[00:15:57.420 --> 00:16:03.660]   deflating price by four or five of the major things out there, I might do it within industries.
[00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:05.580]   You might allow an industry bet.
[00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:10.780]   We're going to be, I'm making this up, don't hold me to it, we're going to be 0.8 correlated.
[00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:16.540]   What's amazing is over a couple of years, how different sometimes 0.8 correlated things
[00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:17.540]   can be.
[00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:18.540]   Yeah.
[00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:19.540]   That often surprises people.
[00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:23.820]   Some of the choices, they may not be provable which one's better, but over the short, even
[00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:26.320]   the medium term can matter.
[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:33.720]   But 0.8 correlated says to me, you are right, there is no God-given way to measure value.
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:40.900]   But I think it matters a little less than people worry about, because price is the main
[00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:43.380]   thing driving the ship.
[00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:49.460]   Price compared to anything reasonable leads to at least fairly decently correlated strategies.
[00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:55.500]   I'd also say cap-weighted market, even that has a little degree of ambiguity.
[00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:57.620]   How deep do you go in the capital structure?
[00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:04.180]   You know, Wilshire 5000 versus S&P 500, size is actually even a little more complicated.
[00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:08.700]   I would agree still with your statement that size and the market are more common.
[00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:12.300]   If you and I both come up with a definition, we're probably going to be more correlated
[00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:13.300]   across those.
[00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:21.140]   But I still think of value, there's a concept that any decent value factor follows, deflating
[00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:26.700]   price by reasonable things and going long, the cheap and short, the expensive on that
[00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:27.700]   measure.
[00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:32.060]   And again, yours and mine, we might fight to the death over whose is better.
[00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:37.020]   We're kind of co-religionists who differ slightly in our dogma at that point.
[00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:42.740]   And as we've seen in history, those are some of the most vicious fights.
[00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:45.140]   But I don't think it's really...
[00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:46.140]   And I would include myself.
[00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:50.300]   I think, of course, after years of doing this, that our way is the best humanly possible.
[00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:54.740]   And I don't mean that arrogantly, I mean that in a sense of we would do it differently if
[00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:59.540]   we didn't think it was the best way to do it, and I'm sure our competitors would.
[00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:01.460]   But again, I think it's a great question.
[00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:04.480]   I think you're right directionally, but I think it is less...
[00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:06.580]   You didn't even say it was a problem, but I don't think it's a problem.
[00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:11.380]   I think most reasonable ways to come up with value will be more similar than you think.
[00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:18.740]   Some people believe that a multi-factor approach to value might solve the problem, at least
[00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:20.460]   for retail investors.
[00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:26.500]   In other words, instead of trying to pick which price to something is value, you just
[00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:30.900]   have a formula that takes a little bit of everything.
[00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:32.700]   I like that approach.
[00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:36.540]   We've written on that approach.
[00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:42.380]   Earning is going a little too far, price divided by, you know, you can imagine crazy things.
[00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:44.540]   I think I even used this phrase a few minutes ago.
[00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:47.120]   Price divided by anything reasonable.
[00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:48.900]   Make up your favorite four or five.
[00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:51.000]   Price divided by book.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.580]   Price divided by trailing earnings.
[00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:54.540]   Price divided by forecasted earnings.
[00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:57.380]   Price divided by free cash flow.
[00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:58.820]   Price divided by sales.
[00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:00.340]   All reasonable.
[00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:04.880]   And I can tell you advantages and disadvantages to each one.
[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:11.620]   I would prefer a stock that is the most attractive on a weighted average of those five more than
[00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:14.780]   I would prefer a stock on any one.
[00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:19.540]   I'm not smart enough and I don't know if anyone else is to pick out which of those five is
[00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:20.540]   actually...
[00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:21.540]   I'm saying five.
[00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:23.860]   It can be many more than that, of course.
[00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:27.180]   But I don't think we're really smart enough to figure out collectively.
[00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:32.260]   I don't think value is that, as you pointed out earlier, that well-defined a concept.
[00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:34.220]   I would rather take the average.
[00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:37.580]   So let's get to another debate.
[00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:45.700]   Is the value premium, at least historically, a result of risk or is it a result of behavior?
[00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:48.860]   Oh, you're going to get me in trouble.
[00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:49.860]   Oh, I am?
[00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:50.860]   I'm sorry.
[00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:53.220]   I like to put it this way.
[00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:56.460]   First, they both can have some influence.
[00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:59.660]   They both can contribute to a positive value premium.
[00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:01.420]   I know you've seen some of my work before.
[00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:03.060]   I'm not always a peacemaker.
[00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:06.060]   Sometimes I like to throw gasoline on a fire.
[00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:10.860]   In this particular case, I often throw water on the fire because I've been in academic
[00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:17.300]   seminars where I point out, you guys are arguing about this, but the real world is complicated.
[00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:21.860]   It could have a risk premium component and a behavioral component and just to really
[00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:25.300]   mess with everyone, those can vary through time.
[00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:28.780]   Right now, I think we're in a fairly crazy period and I'll go out on a limb and say I
[00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:30.940]   think there are more mispricings than normal.
[00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:37.060]   So maybe behavioralism matters more right now and maybe sometimes it matters less and
[00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:38.420]   it's more of a risk premium.
[00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:42.020]   I will tell you, and this is why I said you're going to get me in trouble, even though I
[00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:47.420]   wrote my dissertation on momentum as a Pharma student, I was probably two-thirds, one-third
[00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:49.420]   towards the risk story.
[00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:55.060]   Doing this live for now 26 years, going back to '94, I've certainly drifted more towards
[00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:56.380]   the behavioral story.
[00:20:56.380 --> 00:21:03.420]   I think living through about six cataclysmic events and at least three for value and being
[00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:08.980]   frustrated at those times, to be honest, a world I thought was going a little crazy has
[00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:09.980]   certainly pushed me.
[00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:11.900]   But again, I'm not dismissive of the risk.
[00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:14.060]   I'm probably two-thirds, one-third, the other way.
[00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:20.100]   Now, I'm not someone who feels intellectually confident saying we know the answer here,
[00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:25.940]   but at this point in my career, if I had to bet on one and couldn't split my vote, I would
[00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:30.020]   lean behavioral, though I warn you, I say that on the coast.
[00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:36.540]   If I'm ever in the Midwest and feel like Pharma is within a thousand miles, I change my story.
[00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:40.140]   It's kind of odd though that you would say that, and here's why.
[00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:46.340]   It's because there's been so much work done on behavioral finance and biases and everything
[00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:52.780]   that you would think that we would have resolved some of our internal human issues and that
[00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:57.900]   we would notice that, but what you're really saying is people are acting worse than they
[00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:05.500]   used to be, even though the research by various top Nobel laureate behavioral economists are
[00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:06.700]   putting this information out.
[00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:08.180]   People are reading the books, right?
[00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:14.180]   No, I think that's a fair observation and I have a few thoughts on it.
[00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:16.500]   I think it comes down to this.
[00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:17.820]   Value has been on a terrible streak.
[00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:20.020]   It's kind of a 10-year drawdown.
[00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:23.500]   I think the first seven years of that drawdown were very different than the last three.
[00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:27.700]   I think the last three have been far less rational than the first seven.
[00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:32.100]   Remember my distinction that behavioral can matter, but it's not always behavioral.
[00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:36.860]   But even a few years ago, not 10 years ago, even two, three years ago, maybe the most
[00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:41.020]   common question I got was along the lines of what you're saying.
[00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:44.340]   Not just value, but other factors too, but we'll talk about value here.
[00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:47.500]   If this is true, why doesn't it get arbitraged away?
[00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:52.860]   It could get arbitraged away by too much capital or people could learn and stop making these
[00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:53.860]   biases.
[00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:58.960]   The learning part, which is more where you're coming from, again, I don't see a whole lot
[00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:05.420]   of evidence that human biases are going away or even ameliorating around the world.
[00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:11.220]   We live in a little bit of a bubble where we're very well-versed in all these behavioral
[00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:13.800]   issues and we read all the literature.
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:18.500]   But I think, not to pick on them, it's become an easy punchline, but you go to your average
[00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:24.820]   Robin Hood trader, and I don't think we've gotten through on the arbitrage, why are these
[00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:25.820]   arbitraged away?
[00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:31.060]   Remember, strategy can go away for two reasons, it can go away for either demand or supply.
[00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:36.320]   Demand for strategy is too much capital chasing it, which even if there is a certain amount
[00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:40.600]   of bias in the world, you can't extract an infinite amount of money from that.
[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:44.340]   You can only take the other side and close the gap on valuation.
[00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:50.660]   So if the first trillion dollars closes most of the gap, the second trillion dollars doesn't
[00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:51.660]   make any money.
[00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:52.660]   It's closed.
[00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:54.580]   No one makes any money.
[00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:56.540]   Or it can go away because of supply.
[00:23:56.540 --> 00:24:01.700]   And this is a little bit cynical, but this is behavioral, this is the supply of investor
[00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:03.100]   error.
[00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:07.740]   People have to continue to make errors and a limited amount of capital has to pursue
[00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:08.740]   them.
[00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:13.180]   So again, two and a half, three years ago, the question was, why do these things persist?
[00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:19.140]   After two and a half, three painful years to these strategies, the question I get now
[00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:23.820]   is more, how can anyone stick with these, even if they're great long-term, how can anyone
[00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:25.060]   stick with these?
[00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:30.280]   And I love to point out that these are, in a real way, the opposite question.
[00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:34.060]   One is saying, this is so obvious, everyone should do it and it should go away.
[00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:36.140]   The other is saying, no one can do it.
[00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:39.860]   And I think there's an element of truth to both.
[00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:44.500]   Real life strategies that can be done in large capacity, I mean a strategy like value that
[00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:49.500]   can be done at fairly large scale, is not a super high Sharpe ratio.
[00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:51.380]   I think it's real.
[00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:56.060]   And so a real positive Sharpe ratio, you can add to a diversified portfolio, that is a
[00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:57.980]   wonderful thing.
[00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:02.620]   But it goes through, as we've seen even before the last 10 years, we've seen horrible periods
[00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:04.100]   for value.
[00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:08.460]   And the very fact that it can be very hard to stick with drives a fair amount of people
[00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:10.820]   out, makes it hard to see the whole round trip.
[00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:13.220]   So you do have this kind of yin-yang.
[00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:14.420]   On the one hand, it should go away.
[00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:17.020]   On the other hand, it's really hard to stick with.
[00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:24.420]   And perversely, I think low Sharpe ratio, high capacity strategies that are a long-term
[00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:31.140]   investor's good friend, if you really can stick with them, they can improve a portfolio.
[00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:35.500]   And I think they don't go away precisely because they're at that kind of risk-adjusted return
[00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:37.140]   that's on the cusp.
[00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:39.100]   You can recognize it's good.
[00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:40.980]   Some people can stick with them.
[00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:43.780]   But a lot of people think they can, but can't.
[00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:48.620]   And so if something is real, but 90% of the people throw in the towel when it's had a
[00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:53.340]   bad three years, it's going to stay an opportunity, and it's going to occasionally really hurt.
[00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:58.660]   I think that the overwhelming interest in value investing that occurred in the early
[00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:07.860]   2000s after tech tumbled and value just had an incredible run, small cap value in particular,
[00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:15.260]   created this wave of fundamental weighted ETFs and a whole range of other factor-based
[00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:21.180]   ETFs just came out of the woodwork, and people were inundated with this.
[00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:25.500]   Because of all this interest and because of all this new knowledge that people were getting,
[00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:31.140]   it seems to me made this value factor not work, but also not work for a longer period
[00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:35.020]   of time than normally would have occurred, perhaps.
[00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:37.500]   It's certainly possible.
[00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:42.500]   We certainly live in a cyclical business where people do, in fact, overreact to the prior
[00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:46.260]   big event, and it's possible.
[00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:48.300]   We all collectively did that at one point.
[00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:54.260]   I will say, ever since 1999, when we started our firm right before the teeth of the tech
[00:26:54.260 --> 00:27:00.020]   bubble really took off, we invented and have been tracking since then something that has
[00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:02.860]   come to be called the value spread.
[00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:03.860]   This was...
[00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:08.860]   All right, Fama and French and many others in academia sort stocks on some valuation
[00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:13.580]   ratio and they look at the spread between the cheap and the expensive in returns, but
[00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:16.940]   what was really missing, we couldn't find it anywhere, it's certainly possible someone
[00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:22.460]   privately had done it, but we didn't see it in the literature, was anyone who looked at
[00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:26.020]   and thought the information was interesting in the magnitude.
[00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:27.900]   How cheap is cheap?
[00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:32.220]   Imagine all of value is price to cash flow, and again, like we talked about before, I
[00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:36.800]   would much rather use many, but just to make it simple, you're going long, low price to
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:39.580]   cash flow, and short, high price to cash flow.
[00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:46.740]   The expensive ones will always be more expensive on your own metric, but how much more expensive
[00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:53.060]   and how much cheaper, what the spread is between them will vary through time.
[00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:58.140]   And we did this in the teeth of a very terrible value market and not surprisingly discovered
[00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:03.060]   that after it being terrible, that spread had blown out to record levels.
[00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:04.440]   That didn't have to happen.
[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:10.540]   You can lose in a value strategy or any strategy and have it not get cheaper.
[00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:15.740]   Simplest example, imagine you bought a stock because it had a low P/E and the price fell
[00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:16.740]   50%.
[00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:20.980]   A naive, simple approach to say, "Oh God, it got cheaper."
[00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:27.380]   But if the earnings fell 75%, your favorite metric, P/E doubled, it didn't get cheaper,
[00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:28.380]   it got more expensive.
[00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:33.340]   So you can actually lose in a strategy, if you lose because the fundamentals move against
[00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:37.500]   you, it doesn't necessarily get cheaper, so it was worth checking.
[00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:42.100]   And we did find it had gotten massively cheaper, which means most of what was going on in the
[00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:45.420]   tech bubble, actually, I think more than all, because I don't think these were high quality
[00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:48.540]   companies even, was from price action.
[00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:50.860]   It was not fundamentals.
[00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:54.620]   We've been monitoring this spread in many different ways in many different places ever
[00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:55.620]   since.
[00:28:55.620 --> 00:29:01.140]   Halfway, of course, it's symmetric, halfway to worry about periods like now, where that
[00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:04.700]   spread is back out to approximately record levels.
[00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:10.260]   If you're beaten up in value, is that money gone, meaning you lost on fundamentals, which
[00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:15.980]   you don't give up, you might continue with your strategy, but you don't expect to make
[00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:17.500]   that back.
[00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:21.820]   Or did you lose on price, where you may have an expectation that it's more attractive than
[00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:25.820]   normal now that the premium is larger than normal.
[00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:30.020]   But we didn't track this only for times like today.
[00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:34.900]   Maybe even more so we tracked it to see what if that spread ever compressed well beyond
[00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:36.100]   history.
[00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:38.740]   The only one I have memorized is price to book.
[00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:43.260]   And I think if you look at the standard Fama-French construction, the price to book of the expensive
[00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:49.480]   is 30%, against the cheap, call it 30%.
[00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:52.380]   It averages maybe five or six times.
[00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:56.100]   So the expensive are five or six times more expensive than the cheap.
[00:29:56.100 --> 00:30:01.860]   The low is maybe the high threes, maybe four was the low, and you've hit that a few times.
[00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:08.780]   And the high was about 12 in the tech bubble, 12 to 14, depending upon the precise measurement.
[00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:11.420]   And we are back to similar levels to that.
[00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:17.580]   But one reason we've monitored this forever is what if that spread smashes down to one
[00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:23.140]   and a half, to a compressed level where the differences in valuation are just not very
[00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:30.340]   large and in fact record small compared to history, and then stayed there for a few years.
[00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:35.300]   Your hypothesis that maybe the world has figured this out, maybe they're not making that error
[00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:42.500]   or maybe too much arbitrage capital has come in would be hard to argue with.
[00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:46.900]   You know, if a value strategy exists because there's a spread in valuations, if that spread
[00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:51.820]   in valuations is much smaller than it used to be, maybe the world has figured it out.
[00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:56.860]   And we've always felt monitoring that in case it was time not to do it was the case.
[00:30:56.860 --> 00:31:01.700]   And we've seen lower and we've seen higher, and we certainly see extremely high today,
[00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:06.700]   but we've never seen it smash down to levels that say, you know, value is never going to
[00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:07.700]   work again.
[00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:09.380]   The world has figured it out.
[00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:12.700]   It could certainly still happen in the future.
[00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:18.220]   Let's pivot back to momentum in a very short and eloquent, simple way.
[00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:23.140]   If you can explain the formula for momentum, that's number one.
[00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:30.420]   And then number two, you said that the momentum factor and the value factor are uncorrelated
[00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:31.420]   or at least low...
[00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:32.420]   No, negatively correlated.
[00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:34.520]   Oh, they're negatively correlated, okay.
[00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:38.100]   So if they're negatively correlated and you had them both together in the same portfolio,
[00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:43.380]   I mean, how does that reconcile or do you not have it in the same portfolio?
[00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:48.060]   The simplest measure of momentum I know is still the one I used in my dissertation.
[00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:54.140]   It is simply one year total return, leaving off some of the very recent returns.
[00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:58.460]   I didn't even use daily data, so I left off the last month in my dissertation.
[00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:00.020]   You don't really need to leave a whole month off.
[00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:02.620]   You need to leave off a few days.
[00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:07.580]   That could be because we see some true reversal at the very short term, liquidity provision.
[00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:10.860]   You know, if someone tries to trade a lot, they push a price and it's temporary price
[00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:14.580]   pressure or they're just some microstructure issues.
[00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:20.660]   If the last trade is at the bid, the price looks low and the momentum looks worse.
[00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:25.480]   But if the next trade is half at the bid and half at the offer, half the time, on average
[00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:26.540]   you get a bounce.
[00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:30.780]   So it creates a little bit of an artificial contrarian strategy.
[00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:35.900]   So I often shorten it to one year price momentum and leave off all the geeky stuff about having
[00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:39.540]   to be sure that you don't accidentally get that contrarian part that may or may not be
[00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:44.620]   real at the very short term, but call it simply one year price momentum.
[00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:48.900]   I actually call this the fool strategy when I presented it to Fama, and I think I was
[00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:50.500]   just currying favor there.
[00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:55.860]   I knew he wasn't going to like the momentum strategy, so I might as well be self-deprecating
[00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:56.860]   about it.
[00:32:56.860 --> 00:33:01.060]   But on the face of it, you can't get simpler, right?
[00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:03.140]   Buy a diversified portfolio.
[00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:04.300]   Again, you can do this.
[00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:09.060]   You can weight it in different ways, but buy a diversified portfolio of stocks with strong
[00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:14.700]   one-year returns and sell a diversified portfolio of stocks with weak one-year returns on a
[00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:15.700]   relative basis.
[00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:18.620]   It doesn't matter which direction the market has gone.
[00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:27.840]   Now, of course, I won't get into this, but just like value, you can do this in more complex,
[00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:32.140]   perhaps better, perhaps over-engineered, we can always debate that ways.
[00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:35.060]   You can take out the industry bet from this.
[00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:42.900]   You can look not at total return, but total return net of, say, a beta or multiple betas
[00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:43.900]   to different factors.
[00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:45.660]   What's the excess return?
[00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:48.420]   There are a lot of different things you could do, and people do pursue these.
[00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:53.420]   There are a lot of papers on tweaking the momentum factor, just like there is with value.
[00:33:53.420 --> 00:34:00.100]   Same problem and/or opportunity, depending on your perspective, that there's no one way.
[00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:04.460]   But I think the base way in academia is still this one-year price momentum.
[00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:07.980]   Now, negatively correlated strategies.
[00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:13.940]   The way I think about this is imagine your value strategy, long cheap, short expensive,
[00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:19.780]   has a 5% average return and a 5% long-term volatility.
[00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:21.880]   And imagine so does your momentum strategy.
[00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:28.380]   If they are uncorrelated, you take their volatility and you divide by the square root of 2.
[00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:32.820]   So if you put half your money in each, you get a diversification benefit.
[00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:37.300]   If they are negatively correlated, the volatility comes in even lower.
[00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:41.660]   An implausible negative correlation, you know, if you thought they were negative one correlated,
[00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:44.020]   they both can't have a positive mean.
[00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:46.260]   That's a perpetual motion machine, right?
[00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:50.980]   To say I have two strategies that are perfect hedges, perfectly opposite, but both have
[00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:52.620]   a positive average.
[00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:56.980]   That would be no volatility ever and making money every day.
[00:34:56.980 --> 00:35:01.420]   It's like going long the S&P 500 and short the S&P 500.
[00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:02.420]   Yes.
[00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:06.380]   It's an absolute negative correlation, but you don't make any money.
[00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:07.500]   Exactly.
[00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:14.180]   But in real life, value and momentum, and times it's higher, times it's lower, but call
[00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:17.500]   it a -0.5 correlation.
[00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:20.540]   And that is actually pretty reasonable.
[00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:24.660]   If you say it in English, what you're trying to buy, if you give, and I don't say you have
[00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:29.500]   to give half your weight to each and there are other things besides value and momentum,
[00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:33.580]   but if you gave half your weight to value and half your weight to momentum, the actual
[00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:39.060]   stocks you're trying to buy, forget the quant stuff, just think about describing the stocks,
[00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:44.820]   are cheap stocks that are not disastrous on momentum or even mildly cheap stocks that
[00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:47.660]   have good momentum that are getting better.
[00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:54.380]   I used to laugh and be kind of obnoxious when more traditional managers would all describe
[00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:59.060]   their process as we're looking for value plus a catalyst.
[00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:02.740]   And I used to roll my eyes and say, "You all say the same thing."
[00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:08.540]   And then a friend who was an active stock picker said, "Don't you do value and momentum?"
[00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:09.540]   I said, "Yeah."
[00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:15.460]   And he said, "Don't you think you can describe that as value plus a catalyst?"
[00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:18.740]   And I said, "Damn, I think I see where you're going with it."
[00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:24.940]   So just the mechanical math is if you have two strategies that are not unrealistically
[00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:27.540]   negatively correlated, but are decent.
[00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:31.620]   They're not perfect hedges, they just tend to move in the opposite direction, and both
[00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:32.620]   make money.
[00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:37.300]   I think that is both possible at a minus 0.5 correlation, and you create a better risk
[00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:38.300]   return.
[00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:42.480]   Any time you create a better risk return, you can take that benefit through getting
[00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:48.020]   basically the same average return at lower risk, or you can be more aggressive and try
[00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:53.360]   to translate that into higher returns for similar risk.
[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:59.180]   But I think the idea that there are two strategies that can both make money and partially hedge
[00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:03.460]   each other, not fully because that can't work, but partially hedge each other.
[00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:08.300]   I just think is what's going on with value and momentum, and I think it's quite intuitive.
[00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:12.900]   All is equal if the price goes up, the momentum gets better and the value gets worse.
[00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:15.940]   So let me ask a question.
[00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:18.020]   Dimensional Funds does this.
[00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:24.240]   They first screen for their value stocks, the stocks they want to buy based on their
[00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:30.640]   value screens, and then they buy the ones that have good momentum.
[00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:34.200]   So in other words, value first, and then momentum.
[00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:35.200]   How does that work?
[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:36.200]   Sure.
[00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:40.680]   You know, I mean, I have great respect, of course, for the guys at Dimensional, Fama
[00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:46.060]   and French still do a ton with them, and there's nobody in the industry I respect more.
[00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:48.020]   We do differ on this.
[00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:53.040]   Like I said, people of basically the same religion with small differences.
[00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:59.840]   You get your 30 Years War, you get your Shia-Sunni kind of thing, where essentially we agree
[00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:03.480]   on almost everything, but we disagree about this small point.
[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:04.840]   Let's fight about that.
[00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:07.120]   So that definitely does happen.
[00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:12.400]   I am fond of saying momentum is very hard to reconcile with efficient markets.
[00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:14.760]   I think Ken and Gene would agree.
[00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:20.080]   My DFA using it as a screen, in my view, is very close to just using less of it than we
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:21.080]   do.
[00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:23.920]   You're giving it a say over when you trade, but that's it.
[00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:26.480]   You're not giving it any kind of equal status.
[00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:28.800]   So I think it's just a point on the spectrum.
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:31.960]   I think their philosophy started out more value-based.
[00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:35.100]   I think they recognize that momentum has been a real phenomenon, and they don't want to
[00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:37.160]   trade against it.
[00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:42.480]   We want it to actively contribute, not to dominate value, but to actively contribute.
[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:47.080]   And you know, people who agree on a lot, who even like each other's processes and think
[00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:51.600]   each are good, can differ with where on the spectrum you would be.
[00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:56.000]   You know, if you and I both designed a process with similar data and similar empirical results,
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.840]   we wouldn't necessarily come out with the same weights.
[00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:02.400]   A screen is not technically the same thing, but I think it's pretty close to thinking
[00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:07.720]   of it as them believing in momentum, but less than we do.
[00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:11.720]   And I will say if they ever, you know, say something negative about momentum, I do make
[00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:14.040]   the "a little bit pregnant" joke.
[00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:18.440]   You've already showed you believe in it, you just believe in it less than we do.
[00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:23.320]   So I think we're more similar than we are different on this.
[00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:29.240]   But yes, clearly we would give momentum closer, not necessarily precisely equal.
[00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:34.600]   We don't have to weight these 50/50, but we would give momentum more weight than they
[00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:35.600]   would.
[00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:38.440]   Well, we sort of got off track a little bit because we're actually...
[00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:39.440]   That's my specialty.
[00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:40.440]   No, no, no, no.
[00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:41.440]   This is fine.
[00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:42.440]   This is perfect.
[00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:45.000]   But we haven't even gotten out of college yet.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:50.240]   I mean, you obviously got your PhD, so they accepted your dissertation.
[00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:53.360]   Well, I'm more comfortable with the geek stuff than with the autobiography.
[00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:54.360]   Okay.
[00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:56.360]   But then you went to Goldman Sachs.
[00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:57.720]   I went to Chicago.
[00:39:57.720 --> 00:40:04.080]   I started a dissertation on momentum when I got an offer from friends who were at Goldman
[00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:08.360]   Sachs Asset Management starting up a... taking over.
[00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:12.600]   It was close to a startup, but taking over a fixed income area.
[00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:15.840]   Initially, I went for a summer, which was great.
[00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:19.960]   They then said, "Why don't you come for a year and see if you like this as compared
[00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:22.600]   to being a professor?"
[00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:26.440]   And I still thought I wanted to be a professor at that point, but I did recognize that free
[00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:28.000]   options are good things.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.400]   They teach us that in finance.
[00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:32.280]   So I said, "Let me try this."
[00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:38.040]   I ended up being there about a year and a half, was working on my dissertation at night.
[00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:43.160]   That was an odd experience to be a portfolio manager, a trader, and a modeler in fixed
[00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:47.480]   income during the day and go home and work on quant equity at night.
[00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:50.720]   I was getting closer to... very close to being done.
[00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:54.480]   Fam and friends were great about doing my dissertation from afar.
[00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:55.640]   I went back to Chicago.
[00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:56.640]   I proposed it.
[00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:58.320]   I went back and defended it.
[00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:01.000]   They wanted me to go on the academic job market.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.440]   I got, again, very lucky.
[00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:10.000]   PIMCO, the West Coast Asset Manager, wanted to start a quant research group.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.480]   Quant was getting more popular.
[00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:14.920]   It was still a relatively new thing, believe it or not, back then.
[00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:18.280]   PIMCO ended up offering me that job.
[00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:23.520]   As an aside, the guy who took me out to lunch asked if sushi was okay.
[00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:27.800]   And I had never had sushi and hardly ever had fish at that point in my life.
[00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:34.400]   And being a cowardly 24-year-old, or whatever I was, something 24, 25, I said, "Yeah, sure.
[00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:36.160]   Sushi would be great."
[00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:40.800]   And one point when he wasn't looking, I did spit my food into a napkin.
[00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:42.440]   Gotta come clean about that.
[00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:46.240]   But I went to Goldman and said, "I'm thinking of doing this.
[00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:47.240]   This seems perfect.
[00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:52.200]   I'm trying to decide between academia and being a practitioner, and this seems to be
[00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:54.520]   the best of both worlds."
[00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:58.680]   And to be brutally honest, and I feel bad, it was kind of PIMCO's idea, and we ran with
[00:41:58.680 --> 00:41:59.680]   it.
[00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:02.520]   But Goldman swore to God they were looking to start the same group, and they were thinking
[00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:03.800]   of talking to me.
[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:10.200]   Again, I made the odd life decision not to live, first not to live in Palo Alto, and
[00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:12.120]   then not to live in Newport Beach.
[00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:16.960]   I have managed to avoid good weather rather consistently in my career.
[00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:18.680]   But Goldman said, "Start this group."
[00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:21.040]   And I said, "Yeah, my family's from here.
[00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:22.040]   I like Goldman.
[00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:23.040]   They were treating me well.
[00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:25.600]   I'm an East Coast guy.
[00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:28.080]   Okay, let's start this."
[00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:32.000]   And I hired three people that gave me a budget for a four-person group.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:36.160]   Two were fellow PhD students at the University of Chicago.
[00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:41.320]   One is still my partner today at AQR.
[00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:49.700]   We ended up both building direct quantitative processes to run client money.
[00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:56.000]   Over the course of the next three years, we ended up running probably just about $7 billion,
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:02.880]   about $6 billion in traditional kind of beat-the-benchmark, no leverage, no shorting, just regular stock
[00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:07.920]   picking, though in a quantitative manner, and about $1 billion in long, short, more
[00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:10.880]   hedge fund kind of work.
[00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:16.440]   To be honest, the hedge fund work, being less constrained, we think is a more pure version
[00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:19.080]   of what we do, but it's not that different.
[00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:23.960]   When our factors beat the benchmark, we tend to get positive return in a similar based
[00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:25.280]   hedge fund product.
[00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:28.040]   The hedge fund is kind of the alpha part.
[00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:29.040]   Life went well.
[00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:33.680]   This group, though, had much broader responsibilities than running money.
[00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:37.240]   We were also in charge of pretty much anything quantitative.
[00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:39.880]   We were like door-to-door quants.
[00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:44.160]   Especially before we were running money, we were desperate for someone to give us a task.
[00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:50.400]   So we were doing asset liability analysis, running efficient frontiers for their marketers,
[00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:54.520]   and while there's absolutely nothing wrong with that, it was good stuff, it was really
[00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:58.300]   awkward to be running a group that was running billions of dollars and growing and doing
[00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:04.680]   well and be in charge of the graphics for the marketing people for other people's products.
[00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:11.120]   Sometime, I think it was '96, I had one of my other partners, still to today, a guy named
[00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:16.840]   David Cabellar, started working on me, particularly on the hedge fund side, saying, "You know,
[00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:18.400]   we really could do this on our own.
[00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:22.380]   You guys are at Goldman Sachs, but you buy all outside data.
[00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:24.680]   You don't trade off Goldman Sachs as strategists.
[00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:26.800]   It's all self-contained."
[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:32.080]   And there'd been various hedge funds, booms and busts, but that was a boom time, and he
[00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:33.080]   thought we could do it.
[00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:39.800]   And I spent the better part of '96 doing my Hamlet imitation, "Should I do this?
[00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:40.800]   Should I not?"
[00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:41.800]   Very decisive.
[00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:47.280]   Mid '96, I went to Goldman and actually said, "I'm thinking about doing this."
[00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:50.960]   It was very straightforward, thinking of going off on my own.
[00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:54.560]   They said, "What would it take to keep you and the whole team, not just me?"
[00:44:54.560 --> 00:45:00.240]   I said, "Well, certainly money is part of it, and I won't pretend it wasn't.
[00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:06.480]   We didn't even propose a deal where we'd make anything like if we ran our own successful
[00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:07.480]   hedge fund.
[00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:11.800]   But we proposed something in the middle, some kind of sharing arrangement."
[00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:16.880]   What was really odd was they certainly didn't jump at our first offer, but they met us a
[00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:21.820]   decent part of the way on the more crass issue just of money.
[00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:25.480]   But they were very insistent that we kept doing the support work.
[00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:30.840]   I ended up saying, "Yes, Goldman Sachs does many things well, but retaining employees
[00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:34.080]   they want to retain is something they are excellent at.
[00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:38.840]   Certainly you are sitting with John Corzine, then president of Goldman Sachs, multiple
[00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:43.280]   times being told how much they want to keep you."
[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:47.660]   It turns your 20-something-year-old head.
[00:45:47.660 --> 00:45:51.280]   I ended up, along with the rest of the group, deciding to stay.
[00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:57.520]   Rick, do you ever have one of these giant decisions that as soon as you finally make
[00:45:57.520 --> 00:46:03.920]   the decision, after agonizing, you get a wave of relief, partly just because it's over,
[00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:07.400]   but partly it often seems obvious?
[00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:11.040]   What was not obvious when you were agonizing seems obvious after the fact.
[00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:15.140]   You're like, "Well, yeah, I don't know what I was agonizing about."
[00:46:15.140 --> 00:46:18.080]   I never got my wave of relief.
[00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:24.280]   About a month later I was still going, "We should be doing this on our own."
[00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:29.720]   David again, he was the Mephistopheles, the tempter in this story.
[00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:37.760]   About a month into it, he and I were talking and I said, "Is that still an option?"
[00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:39.960]   You don't say that to David.
[00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:42.960]   I gave away the whole ballgame at that point.
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:47.240]   We agonized for a few more months, but at the end of the year we did decide to go and
[00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:48.800]   do it on our own.
[00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:55.440]   The first time you try to leave when you're someone they want to keep, you get a full
[00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:57.480]   charm offensive.
[00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:00.500]   The second time you do not get the charm offensive.
[00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:06.080]   You get quite the opposite, largely because when you come back the second time, they know
[00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:07.480]   you're gone.
[00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:13.880]   The partner I reported to was not happy with me.
[00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:18.360]   One of the scariest things in my life was telling him I was resigning.
[00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:19.360]   I remember that.
[00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:21.400]   I was a total child.
[00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:27.280]   I played psych-up music on my Sony cassette Walkman in my office before I went down to
[00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:28.840]   the offices.
[00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:31.640]   I was not calm, but it worked out.
[00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:34.400]   Well, it sure did.
[00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:40.240]   You ended up creating an incredible powerhouse, AQR.
[00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:45.900]   By the end of last year, you had $186 billion in assets under management.
[00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:48.280]   That's a phenomenal number.
[00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:55.040]   Clearly you made the right decision, and of course to be congratulated.
[00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:57.800]   Your father would be proud of you.
[00:47:57.800 --> 00:48:00.560]   I hope so.
[00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:04.440]   I have just a couple more questions from the Bogleheads, and I've asked you some already,
[00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:06.320]   but I just have a few more.
[00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:09.480]   This has to do with things that you've wrote about over the years.
[00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:16.080]   One of the things you wrote about was the 60/40 portfolio, and is it a good solution
[00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:17.200]   going forward?
[00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:22.760]   Just realize that a lot of investors invest along the 60/40.
[00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:24.120]   What's wrong with 60/40?
[00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:25.560]   We hear a lot about this recently.
[00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:26.560]   What do you think?
[00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:31.880]   Well, first of all, pretty much ever since we and others have been saying that 60/40
[00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:35.800]   just chugs along, some wild volatility at times.
[00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:40.960]   Mid-March this year, it didn't seem like it was chugging along, but on net, it's continued
[00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:42.480]   to do well.
[00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:48.280]   My issues with 60/40, there are two, a long-term one and a conditional one on where we are
[00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:50.960]   today.
[00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:53.560]   The long-term one is there's nothing wrong with it.
[00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:56.720]   I think it's great to have that as a core of your portfolio.
[00:48:56.720 --> 00:49:01.360]   There's no magic to the particular weights of 60/40.
[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:06.120]   Of course, like everything else, we pick kind of a benchmark, and then it gets holy over
[00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:07.120]   time.
[00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:15.000]   I don't think 65/35 or 55/45 is going to be any great sin, but the general idea of being
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:19.400]   diversified across stocks and bonds as a core is great.
[00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:23.640]   We do think you could do better, both in a traditional sense, you know, all the classic
[00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:28.080]   things we talk about, being global, at least to some extent, you can still have a home
[00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:34.800]   bias, but 60/40 is often thought of as the domestic U.S. portfolio.
[00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:40.080]   There are other ways to make it better, but if you believe that there is a value premium,
[00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:44.760]   there is a momentum premium, then you can just view that as another investment that's
[00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:47.120]   not very correlated to 60/40.
[00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:53.040]   We do think long-term you can at least somewhat improve the risk-adjusted return or the total
[00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:57.840]   return if you choose to take enough risk of 60/40.
[00:49:57.840 --> 00:50:01.680]   Today, it's a little more serious.
[00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:04.000]   These are very long-term phenomenon.
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:08.520]   We always, thank God, we caution, don't use this to time the market, don't use this to
[00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:13.640]   make a one-year forecast, but stocks, you know, pick your favorite measure.
[00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:18.760]   I remember when the Shiller CAPE was a brand-new baby in 1996, but it's become kind of the
[00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:23.680]   lingua franca in talking about how expensive the stock market, just like any valuation
[00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:27.380]   measure, it's not the only one by any means, there are a whole set of them.
[00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:32.560]   The Shiller CAPE, I think last time I looked, just a few days ago, it was about 32, it hit
[00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:37.040]   below 40s at the end, in '99, 2000.
[00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:43.600]   So if you graph it back, you know, 100 years, the only way it looks reasonable is if you
[00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:47.800]   squint and compare it to the tech bubble.
[00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:52.120]   If you compare it to the whole series, it's somewhere in the, again, don't hold me to
[00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:57.200]   the precise number, the 92nd percentile expensive versus history.
[00:50:57.200 --> 00:51:02.200]   And statistically, it's actually hard to say strong things about long-term returns because
[00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:07.900]   you don't get to observe enough, let's call it 10-year or longer periods.
[00:51:07.900 --> 00:51:12.680]   But what we do get to observe seems to fit with intuition.
[00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:18.680]   When you buy stocks more expensive, the average return is lower going forward and vice versa.
[00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:21.440]   So therefore, we'd expect positive returns out of stocks.
[00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:26.240]   We're not people who are forecasting giant mean reversion and a crash, but we do forecast
[00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:30.360]   a lower risk premium for long-term investors from here.
[00:51:30.360 --> 00:51:34.960]   And this is even easier because it fits intuition even more so.
[00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:36.560]   The same for bonds.
[00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:41.680]   When bonds are selling for near zero real yield against economists' forecast of long-term
[00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:48.440]   inflation, not many of us need great convincing that they're probably, probably from here
[00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:54.320]   in the next, call it 10 years, going to make less on their bonds than history in a real
[00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:56.640]   sense against inflation.
[00:51:56.640 --> 00:52:02.200]   If stocks are less than normal and bonds are less than normal, then you could do some very
[00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:05.440]   complicated math, this is stochastic calculus.
[00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:11.400]   You take 60% of your estimate for stock returns and you add it to 40% of your estimate for
[00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:15.400]   bond returns, and you get your estimate for 60/40.
[00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:18.840]   4% is really what you're looking at, maybe.
[00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:19.840]   Nominal.
[00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:20.840]   We think it's about 1.5% real.
[00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:21.840]   Nominal, yeah.
[00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:23.680]   Yeah, no, you're dead on.
[00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:28.960]   And that, you know, I prefer real because it just adjusts for the environment, but,
[00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:34.000]   you know, that comes out to about 1.5% real right now.
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:41.800]   History is more like 5%, meaning if you could buy a diversified portfolio at a low transactions
[00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:45.520]   cost and a low fee, that's a big if, because there's a long part of history where you really
[00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:47.380]   couldn't do that.
[00:52:47.380 --> 00:52:52.400]   But if you could, you got 5% real just for showing up.
[00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:57.640]   We think you get 1.5, 2% real just for showing up today.
[00:52:57.640 --> 00:52:59.200]   And that's not negative.
[00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:03.800]   You can make it negative if you want to forecast big mean reversion, but that's market timing.
[00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:06.160]   That's saying we know these prices are going to drop.
[00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:07.160]   I don't know that.
[00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:09.760]   This could be the new normal.
[00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:17.120]   If the prices drop, it'll be even worse, but I'm negative enough at 1.5, 2%.
[00:53:17.120 --> 00:53:21.720]   If you do have alternatives that can make a portfolio better on average, I think they're
[00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:25.160]   more important when the core portfolio is offering you less.
[00:53:25.160 --> 00:53:31.240]   Let me ask a question about international stocks because I look at the international
[00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:37.760]   market and I look at the industry group weightings of ex-U.S. or international stocks versus
[00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:41.260]   U.S. stocks, and I see very different industry groups.
[00:53:41.260 --> 00:53:42.260]   And I see very-
[00:53:42.260 --> 00:53:43.800]   In the U.S. there's certainly more tech.
[00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:45.720]   And more healthcare.
[00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:47.220]   And now more communications.
[00:53:47.220 --> 00:53:49.720]   So it's a different makeup.
[00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:52.360]   It's like 50 years ago, we did everything in this country.
[00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:56.920]   Now we import all our desks and computers and just about everything I'm looking at right
[00:53:56.920 --> 00:53:57.920]   here in front of me.
[00:53:57.920 --> 00:54:04.640]   But my point is that if you look at the valuations of international stocks, just use the Vanguard
[00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:08.200]   Total International Index Fund.
[00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:12.520]   And I didn't know I was looking at the Vanguard Total International Index Fund.
[00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:17.480]   All I was looking at was the price to earnings ratio, the price to book ratio, return on
[00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:18.480]   equity, growth rate.
[00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:21.920]   I thought I'd be looking at a mid-cap value index.
[00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:26.720]   And then lo and behold, you pull the cover off and it's the international market.
[00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:31.320]   Can't people who are doing, say, a 60/40 portfolio, and to your point that a lot of people are
[00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:37.720]   thinking about just U.S. stocks, can't they diversify or maybe get some of the value premium
[00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:44.720]   that you're talking about as simply as adding, instead of having all U.S., having 40% U.S.
[00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:46.520]   and 20% international?
[00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:47.520]   Would that work?
[00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:48.520]   Absolutely.
[00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:55.240]   I would say you really don't have to choose one or the other.
[00:54:55.240 --> 00:55:00.920]   International versus the U.S., even when international is cheap, is not highly correlated at all
[00:55:00.920 --> 00:55:08.240]   to when value works as we do it within industries for picking individual stocks.
[00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:13.960]   The basic math of portfolios says you should do everything you believe in that's diversifying.
[00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:15.880]   You should just have a high standard for what you believe in.
[00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:19.000]   So you don't end up doing a ridiculous amount.
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:22.360]   But I don't think these are necessarily competitive solutions.
[00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:24.640]   I think they're complementary solutions.
[00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:29.640]   You could do half of what you would have done over each and have less risk of disaster if
[00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:31.560]   you're wrong on either one.
[00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:32.960]   But absolutely.
[00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:38.840]   I do think even if you adjust for the industry, a long, long time ago, we wrote a paper in
[00:55:38.840 --> 00:55:46.080]   the mid '90s showing that cheap countries with good momentum can outperform expensive
[00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:51.280]   countries with bad momentum if you just pretend the index is a single stock and add up the
[00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:54.560]   numbers for the underlying components.
[00:55:54.560 --> 00:55:59.200]   But years later, we did notice exactly what you are talking about, that of course you
[00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:03.560]   can get some very different industry components, particularly in some of the smaller countries
[00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:05.840]   where you don't have a very large cross-section.
[00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:09.240]   You go to Belgium and you get a ton of financials.
[00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:12.800]   You go to Australia and you get a lot of resource stocks.
[00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:16.960]   So this gets really geeky, and this is your fault, Rick, that I'm doing this.
[00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:19.000]   You brought it up.
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:23.520]   But years ago, we modified what we do in comparing countries.
[00:56:23.520 --> 00:56:27.200]   We still compare them straight out against each other, as you were doing, but we also
[00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:32.020]   do something where we look at a country's industry composition.
[00:56:32.020 --> 00:56:37.160]   We look at the global, including the U.S., total cap-weighted global industry, get its
[00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:44.840]   valuation, forecast based only on its industry composition what we think the valuation ratio
[00:56:44.840 --> 00:56:49.640]   of that country would be if everything was selling at an average for the industry, and
[00:56:49.640 --> 00:56:56.840]   then call it cheap or expensive only if it's lower or higher than that forecasted price.
[00:56:56.840 --> 00:56:59.000]   So it's kind of like a similar thing.
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:03.660]   Remember earlier I said we take our value bet without taking a whole lot of industry
[00:57:03.660 --> 00:57:04.660]   exposure?
[00:57:04.660 --> 00:57:05.660]   At least I think I said that earlier.
[00:57:05.660 --> 00:57:06.880]   I say that most of the time.
[00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:07.880]   Yeah, I thought you did.
[00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:08.880]   You said that.
[00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:10.980]   I did.
[00:57:10.980 --> 00:57:16.360]   But we found that makes the country betting a little higher of a risk-adjusted return,
[00:57:16.360 --> 00:57:17.360]   but we still do both.
[00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:22.720]   We give weight to both, and both will say, even adjusting for industries, we think the
[00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:25.780]   U.S. is expensive against the world.
[00:57:25.780 --> 00:57:31.160]   Like everything else, value alone, particularly for big decisions like U.S. versus global,
[00:57:31.160 --> 00:57:32.980]   it could be wrong for a long, long time.
[00:57:32.980 --> 00:57:36.020]   It's just a question of, is it a smart bet?
[00:57:36.020 --> 00:57:41.180]   And we do think it's a smart bet to have some outside the U.S., partly because we always
[00:57:41.180 --> 00:57:46.020]   think that, because we like diversification, but also conditionally, as you're saying,
[00:57:46.020 --> 00:57:49.100]   because it has more of a value tilt than it normally does right now.
[00:57:49.100 --> 00:57:53.220]   Well, since you agreed with me on the last point and made me look very smart, I think
[00:57:53.220 --> 00:57:56.780]   I'm going to end the podcast here.
[00:57:56.780 --> 00:57:59.820]   You're afraid one more question, and I'll disagree, and it'll all collapse.
[00:57:59.820 --> 00:58:00.820]   That's smart.
[00:58:00.820 --> 00:58:01.820]   Thank you.
[00:58:01.820 --> 00:58:02.820]   Remember Steinfeld?
[00:58:02.820 --> 00:58:06.780]   That's George Costanza, has learned that if he ever says something smart in a meeting,
[00:58:06.780 --> 00:58:12.580]   he excuses himself from the meeting immediately, and says thank you, and just claims victory.
[00:58:12.580 --> 00:58:13.580]   That's what I'm going to do.
[00:58:13.580 --> 00:58:17.620]   Cliff, thank you very much for being our guest, and we really appreciate your insights.
[00:58:17.620 --> 00:58:20.360]   It's been a real pleasure having you on the show.
