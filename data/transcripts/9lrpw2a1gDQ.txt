[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420]   (soft music)
[00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:05.080]   - Hello, this is Pastor John.
[00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.440]   I get to start this episode by talking
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.440]   about another Pastor John, John Newton.
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.260]   Newton was a key leader in England in the 18th century,
[00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.640]   as you know, the author of the incredibly popular hymn,
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.220]   "Amazing Grace."
[00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.120]   Newton was a former captain of a slave trading ship
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.080]   and was dramatically converted from this life of sin
[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.880]   and eventually helped William Wilberforce
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.760]   in the British slave trade.
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.760]   So I wanted to take a moment to introduce you
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.580]   to a new book about a part of Newton's life
[00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:40.980]   that goes overlooked.
[00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.720]   His 40 plus years in pastoral ministry
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.080]   and the amazing ministry of writing letters
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.880]   to people in need.
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.600]   The book is written by Tony Reinke,
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.720]   the host of this podcast.
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.400]   Tony calls his book "Pastoral Synthesis."
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.080]   He wants you to be pastored by John Newton.
[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.480]   And so he gathered up all of Newton's many published letters
[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.120]   about a thousand of them in various collections,
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.140]   many of them preserved in old, rare, fragile volumes
[00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.800]   in libraries around the world.
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.240]   He found them, studied them,
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.800]   and then identified Newton's key answers
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.360]   to the perennial questions of the Christian life.
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.040]   And then Tony wrote all his findings
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.660]   into a guided tour of Newton's thought.
[00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.840]   It's a kind of "Ask Pastor John Newton."
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.720]   The book releases this week.
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.560]   It's titled "Newton on the Christian Life
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.640]   to Live as Christ."
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.000]   I commend it very highly.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.380]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.240]   What is the key to ministry longevity?
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.320]   There is a key, and John Piper finds it
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.920]   in the ministry legacy of John Newton.
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.000]   Here's how Pastor John Piper explained it
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.680]   in his 2001 biographical message.
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.740]   - Newton's realism about the limits of this life.
[00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.200]   Oh, how helpful it is to hear his realism.
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.600]   Only so much is possible in a fallen world.
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.920]   We groan waiting for the redemption of our bodies.
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.120]   And if we don't realize the limits of our ministry,
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.840]   we will absolutely go crazy trying to fix the world
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.320]   and fix everybody.
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.240]   He said, "My course of study, like that of a surgeon,
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.160]   has been principally in walking the hospital."
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.240]   He did not, however, become cynical
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.660]   as he walked the hospital
[00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.880]   and saw the irremedial diseases of bedlam.
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.080]   The word bedlam comes from
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.920]   insane asylum hospital in his day.
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.160]   He said, "I endeavor to walk through the world
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.560]   as a physician goes through bedlam.
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.880]   The patients make noise, pester him with impertinence,
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.520]   hinder him in his business,
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.520]   but he does the best he can and gets through."
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.640]   I read that last November or somewhere,
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.000]   and I just said, "Thank you, thank you.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.840]   That's all I do.
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.140]   I just do the best I can, get through,
[00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.340]   get through this mess, get through that mess,
[00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.400]   get through this mess. Thank you, Newton.
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.460]   Thank you for telling me that's the way
[00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:21.840]   you did your ministry."
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.740]   You just walk through an insane asylum,
[00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.360]   and you're pestered by this person
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.800]   and grabbed by that person,
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.240]   and you reach out, you touch, you pray, you bless,
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.280]   you call, you get criticism,
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.440]   you didn't call soon enough, you didn't say this,
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.940]   and you just look up and say,
[00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.220]   "Sinner, though I am, I did the best I could.
[00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.360]   I'm gonna keep going."
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.540]   And that's the key.
[00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.940]   Realism keeps you going.
[00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.720]   Perfectionism wipes you out.
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.940]   So have Newton's realism.
[00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.180]   Here's the picture.
[00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.980]   He had to put it in a picture, right?
[00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.100]   It's so beautiful.
[00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.420]   He's standing at his window,
[00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.860]   looking out on the sun about to come up.
[00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.300]   The day is now breaking.
[00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.380]   How beautiful its appearance.
[00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.240]   How welcome the expectation of the approaching sun.
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:14.240]   It is this thought makes the dawn agreeable
[00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.420]   that it is the presage of a brighter light.
[00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:22.280]   Otherwise, if we expect no more day than in this minute,
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.360]   we should rather complain of darkness
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.660]   than rejoice in the early beauties of the morning.
[00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.660]   Thus the life of grace is the dawn of immortality,
[00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.540]   beautiful beyond expression,
[00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:39.140]   if compared with the night of thick darkness,
[00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:40.540]   which formerly covered us,
[00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:45.320]   yet faint and indistinct and unsatisfying
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.900]   in comparison to the glory that will be revealed.
[00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.520]   Compared with the present condition only,
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.640]   there's a lot of darkness left,
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.880]   but the sun's rising in your life.
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.100]   It's rising in your life.
[00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.600]   And the glory is gonna be beautiful.
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.240]   So be realistic, folks.
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.240]   We groan inwardly, waiting our adoption of sons,
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.940]   the redemption of our bodies.
[00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.160]   Our groaning in this life will never end.
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.960]   There will be mental illness.
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.580]   There will be physical illness.
[00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.580]   There will be church disputes.
[00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.040]   There will be marital stresses.
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.060]   There will be wayward children till Jesus comes.
[00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:27.960]   And if we can't model our way
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.620]   through the insane asylum of this world, we will quit.
[00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.620]   Let's help each other, not quit.
[00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.020]   Newton has helped me.
[00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:37.180]   I wanna help you.
[00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.180]   That's one route.
[00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.420]   The next route is his humility and gratitude.
[00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.340]   He was overwhelmed by amazing grace.
[00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.380]   How sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me.
[00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.840]   I once was lost, but now I'm found.
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.020]   With lying, but now I see.
[00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.260]   Till the day he died, he never ceased to be blown away
[00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.240]   by the fact that he had been saved
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.700]   and made a preacher of the gospel
[00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.220]   that he once labored to destroy and mock.
[00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:01.740]   He wrote his own epitaph.
[00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.700]   Read it on his grave, which is now in Olden.
[00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:05.880]   They used to be in London.
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.140]   They moved it so a subway could go through
[00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:09.980]   underneath the church.
[00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:14.580]   John Newton, clerk, once an infidel and libertine,
[00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.380]   a servant of slaves in Africa,
[00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:18.580]   was by the rich mercy of our Lord and Savior,
[00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:21.340]   Jesus Christ, preserved, restored, pardoned,
[00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:23.020]   and appointed to preach the faith
[00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.160]   he had long labored to destroy.
[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.100]   Near 16 years at Olden in Bucks,
[00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:29.060]   and, and they left the number blank,
[00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:33.340]   years at this church in St. Mary's, Woolnoth.
[00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.580]   He was overwhelmed by this,
[00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:39.220]   and he wrote, and he didn't see how anybody
[00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:41.000]   could know how he was saved
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.140]   and not treat others with kindness.
[00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:47.460]   He said, "A humble under such a sense
[00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:49.140]   of much forgiveness to himself,
[00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:52.380]   he finds it easy to forgive others."
[00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:54.120]   If you're a hard pastor,
[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:58.940]   you don't properly know what's happened to you.
[00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:02.720]   If you're a hard pastor,
[00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:08.180]   your first reaction is a hard reaction.
[00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:13.180]   You are not duly feeling the wonder that you are saved.
[00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:18.940]   - That was from John Piper's 2001 message to pastors
[00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:20.820]   titled, "John Newton,
[00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.420]   The Tough Roots of His Habitual Tenderness."
[00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:25.820]   You can find the full audio recording of this message

[00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:30.740]   And special thanks to cellist Patricia White
[00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:33.340]   for her beautiful rendition of "Amazing Grace"
[00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:35.700]   off her album, "Bestow My Soul,"
[00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:37.660]   which we are using in this episode.
[00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:40.980]   And a special thank you to Pastor John himself
[00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:42.540]   for promoting my new book here
[00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:44.180]   and for writing the foreword.
[00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:45.340]   You can find the book online
[00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:47.100]   and you can actually read the foreword for free
[00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:52.100]   right now at desiringgod.org/newton.
[00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:53.100]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:55.820]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John Podcast.
