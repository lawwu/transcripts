[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.520]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.840]   skills, insight and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.180]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:12.180]   My name is Josh Rasheeds.
[00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:17.960]   I'm your host and today on the show I want to share with you some insights that I have,
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.600]   few ideas that I've come up with personally and it's my hope that these ideas might
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:28.880]   help you to, as the great Wayne Gretzky said, "Skate to where the puck is going to be,
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.600]   not where it is."
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.840]   I call this the WhatsApp phenomenon and this is an idea that I've considered for a good
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.760]   number of years now but I see applications of it to the world around us, to some of the
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.400]   questions that you might be thinking about, some of the ideas that you might be considering
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:53.160]   and yet this is something that has happened within your and my lifetime and I think the
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.080]   drivers of what I'm about to describe to you are something that you can see personally
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.200]   which makes it interesting as a philosophical tool.
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.480]   One of the definitions of philosophy that I like is those things that people everywhere
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.720]   can think about just based upon their personal experience.
[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.740]   You don't need to go out and do research on anything.
[00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.840]   You can just think about this and so I'm going to elaborate a theory that I came up with
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:13.840]   personally.
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.800]   I've never seen this theory read or I've never gone looking for articles on this theory.
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.160]   They might be out there but I came up with this theory but I think you'll probably be
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:26.400]   able to see the point that I'm making in this theory and then see the application of it.
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.320]   I want to talk about how the world develops and is developing.
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:38.720]   My undergraduate degree is in international business and when I was an international business
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.820]   student one of many books that I read when I was in college was Thomas Friedman's book
[00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:53.200]   called The World is Flat and in that book I think, I haven't read it in 20 years, excuse
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:00.200]   me, in 15 years, I haven't read the book in 15 years and so I hope I'm citing the right
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.200]   book.
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.880]   But in that book Friedman talks about how mobile communications technology was transforming
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.760]   the African continent and the argument that Friedman advanced in that book was basically
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:14.840]   this.
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:22.640]   If you were to go back to say 1950, one of the most connected places in the world would
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.560]   have been a place like the United States.
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:35.760]   Other countries as well but once the telephone was developed you had an incredible investment
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.480]   into making sure that that technology was accessible.
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:49.160]   The ability to speak to somebody with synchronous voice communications was a tremendous path
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.600]   forward, a tremendous advance, a tremendous step forward and so in the United States you
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.440]   had tremendous investment into wiring the country.
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.920]   Over time the country of the United States became completely wired with electricity and
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.280]   it became completely wired with telephone lines, telephone communications.
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.960]   It was not always that way.
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:20.320]   My father grew up on a remote ranch in the mountains of Colorado and the only form of
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:26.360]   communication that they had with the outside world was through the use of radio.
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:32.240]   My grandmother was a ham radio operator because that allowed her to talk to her friends across
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.920]   the state and across the region.
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.200]   Then a telephone was installed eventually but of course it was a different kind of telephone
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:45.240]   system and you started to see the fact that the United States had invested heavily into
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:52.040]   getting even the remote regions of the country connected with telephone lines.
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:04:01.720]   In my childhood cell phone technology, mobile telephone technology started to become useful.
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.840]   At first it was of course the domain of the rich to be able to have a car phone.
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:12.440]   Then they started to become more popular and when I graduated high school that was basically
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:20.120]   the turning point at which a cell phone went from being a luxury good to being a common
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.920]   ordinary necessity.
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:28.060]   Now when I was in college one of the pieces of data that I read in the Friedman book was
[00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:35.100]   how this technology was transforming Africa and how much faster it was being accepted
[00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:40.040]   in Africa than it was in the United States.
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:47.920]   Friedman made the point that the ability that a rural farmer now had on his small farm somewhere
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:54.240]   in the African continent to reach real-time market data of the price of crops or current
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:05:00.600]   events or things that would affect his life, that was tremendous and yet that technology
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:07.520]   curve, that development curve in Africa was far faster than it was in the United States.
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.320]   Now the technology was designed, many parts of it originally in the United States and
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.320]   other nations as well.
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:20.440]   Different systems were rolled out and there was good application but in many ways it was
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:28.320]   a lot faster in Africa because there was no need to install the infrastructure that the
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:33.760]   United States and Germany and Canada and Great Britain had gone through being some of the
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:34.840]   more developed countries.
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:41.000]   They had invested a lot of money and time into stringing the entire country with wires
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:48.520]   whereas in the African continent all they had to do to realize a communications revolution
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.960]   was to go in and install cell phone towers and it's much much easier to install cell
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:59.560]   phone towers than it is to install millions of miles of wires connected to central plants
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:05.600]   and connected to each house and so the pace of development was far faster which is phenomenal,
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:11.720]   just wonderful for the economic growth and development in the African continent.
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:17.500]   But here's where I observe that things changed.
[00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:25.380]   If you were to go to many parts of the world today, Africa, Latin America, really many
[00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:31.040]   parts of the world outside of the United States, perhaps outside of Western Europe, if you
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.640]   were to try to call somebody or try to connect with them on their telephone you will almost
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.200]   never do it.
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:41.720]   You'll almost never connect with someone using the telephone.
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:47.520]   Rather what you will do is you will use an app and it's most likely to be WhatsApp.
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:52.520]   There may be regional variations in China, it'll be WeChat but in many parts of the world
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:57.480]   it'll be WhatsApp, the largest most popular app used on a regular basis by something like
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:05.240]   two billion people and I've thought a lot about why that is and here I see an interesting
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:13.080]   trend that is happening on a global basis right now, that I can observe right now.
[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:17.160]   When I meet somebody, for example right now my family and I are here in Costa Rica, when
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:22.320]   I meet a Costa Rican and I want to communicate with that person we're going to communicate
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:29.940]   on WhatsApp whereas in the United States when I meet a US American we're going to communicate
[00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:31.580]   on the phone.
[00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:35.480]   And so in the US American culture, while of course there are millions and millions of
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:43.640]   US Americans who have WhatsApp on their devices, in that culture the phone is a perfectly viable
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:44.640]   alternative.
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:47.880]   We're used to talking on the phone, we've been talking on the phone for a very long
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:52.060]   time, the phone works fine and so we do business based on phone numbers.
[00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:55.200]   But in Latin America and Africa it's not that same way.
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:08:00.440]   You'll often see instead of a phone number you'll often see the business post their WhatsApp
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:04.840]   phone number right on the front door, a little WhatsApp logo, contact us on WhatsApp.
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:09.360]   You go to their website and when you click contact us it'll pop open the WhatsApp chat
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:14.440]   and you can chat with them right on WhatsApp instead of using either an external chat client
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:18.200]   or instead of having their phone number or their email.
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:22.440]   And so the point here is that technologies are adopted differently based upon different
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:23.440]   needs.
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:27.680]   Now let's talk about WhatsApp versus telephones.
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:34.240]   WhatsApp is superior to the telephone in every single way that I can come up with.
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:43.800]   I cannot come up with one single point wherein a telephone, even a mobile phone, is better
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:46.400]   than WhatsApp.
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.320]   Let me give you some examples.
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:53.260]   WhatsApp doesn't restrict your communication to one form of communication.
[00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:57.560]   WhatsApp allows you to call and use a voice call.
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:03.980]   WhatsApp allows you to do a video call and add a video image when that's convenient.
[00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:08.260]   WhatsApp allows you to send written text messages.
[00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:12.400]   WhatsApp allows you to send audio messages.
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:13.800]   So you can choose.
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:17.280]   WhatsApp allows you to send gifts and stickers and whatever else you want to do to express
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:18.440]   yourself.
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:20.720]   WhatsApp allows you to do all of those things.
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:26.320]   WhatsApp allows you to communicate with one single individual.
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:30.400]   WhatsApp also allows you to communicate with groups and to create them on the fly.
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:33.000]   You can just create a group in a moment and then you can disband it.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.520]   You can clear it out.
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:37.880]   You can do anything with it.
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:39.640]   WhatsApp works on any device.
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.040]   It'll work on a tablet.
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.400]   It'll work on a computer.
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:47.600]   It'll work on a cell phone and it'll stay connected and organized among all of those.
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:52.920]   WhatsApp allows you to function without paying any kind of monthly fees.
[00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:56.800]   Now one of the unique things about WhatsApp as compared to some other platforms which
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.640]   also provide the same technology.
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.520]   I'm just using WhatsApp because it's the most prominent.
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:04.080]   You could apply the same logic to some of the other platforms.
[00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:06.040]   But you don't have to have an active phone number.
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:10.040]   You do have to have an active cell phone with a connection, an active device, but that doesn't
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:13.320]   have to actually be tied to an active phone number.
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:16.160]   You can run it with a voice number.
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:17.680]   You can run it with a free number.
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.600]   You can run it in a couple of different ways.
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:22.480]   And so it's a really useful system.
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:26.080]   And the reason that, I forgot, encryption, right?
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:30.080]   WhatsApp is encrypted and encrypted which is a tremendous benefit that the telephone
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:33.640]   and standard SMS messaging doesn't offer to you.
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:35.600]   WhatsApp is really good at giving you additional data.
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:39.800]   Hey like message received, message read.
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:44.320]   It allows you to, it's good at sitting there and queuing up messages and waiting until
[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:46.200]   you have a signal to send them out.
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:50.840]   So it's just a better solution technologically on every level.
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:57.360]   So why is it that the world has not noticed it and everyone adopted WhatsApp to the same
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.360]   level?
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:05.640]   Why is it that a store, a massage parlor or a chiropractor office in the United States
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:10.240]   of America won't have a WhatsApp profile?
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:12.920]   Perhaps some individuals working in there will have their own personal thing but they
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:18.000]   won't use it on a business level whereas a chiropractor or a massage parlor or something
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.400]   in Latin America likely will.
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:25.560]   Well, I think it comes down to the need and who benefits from the system.
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:30.960]   So let's go back to the development of mobile telephony.
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:36.640]   In the United States when phones first came out they were very expensive but we were accustomed
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:38.640]   to working in a phone system.
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:43.760]   My early plans had a certain number of text messages, had a certain number of minutes,
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:49.600]   you had in network minutes, you had out of network minutes, you tracked all that stuff.
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.120]   Then cost came down, competition came up.
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:57.200]   Today virtually any plan that I'm aware of will certainly allow for unlimited talk and
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:03.280]   text and your plans are mainly differentiated based upon the amount of data that you consume.
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:08.640]   But WhatsApp came out of the need around the world for people to use their communication
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:10.840]   devices more frugally.
[00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:12.680]   WhatsApp solved a problem.
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:19.720]   It allowed somebody, it allowed that proverbial, you know, Friedman's farmer in Africa to just
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:25.080]   pay for a little bit of data and WhatsApp was much better with his data usage because
[00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:30.160]   instead of sending one SMS message he could just send a little tiny data burst and communicate
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:31.640]   on WhatsApp.
[00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:35.080]   He could send data when he needed and the data would get through, the message would
[00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:37.180]   get through pretty reliably.
[00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:39.400]   And so it was just cheaper, it was more frugal on data.
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:45.600]   To this day I find that WhatsApp, I'll often be on a conversation on Signal or FaceTime
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:50.980]   or even Messenger, something like that, and I'll find that of any of those WhatsApp has
[00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:54.480]   the best protocols to work well on a slow connection.
[00:12:54.480 --> 00:13:00.320]   You can have a genuinely decent voice conversation, a simultaneous synchronous voice communication
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:05.320]   conversation, on WhatsApp even without a ton of data speed, which is pretty remarkable.
[00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:08.360]   Their engineers are phenomenal.
[00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:12.740]   So I think I've given, talked enough about the technical side of things.
[00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:18.520]   Just to demonstrate that in my view WhatsApp is a superior offering.
[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:25.440]   It's a better solution than telephones and it's something that has revolutionized the
[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:27.880]   world and is revolutionizing the world.
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:31.880]   That communications revolution is truly phenomenal.
[00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:36.040]   Now what do you see happening though with regard to WhatsApp?
[00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:41.200]   The first observation that I have is regardless of how good a technical solution is, people
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:45.840]   are generally comfortable with what they're comfortable with.
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:51.800]   I don't know what percentage of US American people who have a telephone have WhatsApp
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:14:00.320]   installed, but if it were a few years ago the percentage would have been extremely low
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.960]   because it's just not used.
[00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:04.440]   It's not used among "normal people".
[00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:08.680]   Certainly young people use it, but it's just not used among normal people.
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:12.080]   But at some point in time somebody gets hooked, right?
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:13.080]   Somebody something happens.
[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:14.720]   They say I want to communicate with you.
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.280]   You're talking across continents, right?
[00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:19.620]   I neglected to say this earlier when I was talking about the benefits of WhatsApp.
[00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:30.040]   You have the same exact completely free cost of communicating from New York City to Addis
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:37.120]   Ababa, Ethiopia as you do communicating from New York City to upstate, right, to Rochester
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:38.280]   or something.
[00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:41.920]   So that's phenomenal, right?
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:49.780]   If you get in a cab with somebody in the United States with a driver from Ethiopia, there's
[00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:54.820]   a good chance that they're just chatting with their family continually on WhatsApp for no
[00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:55.940]   cost.
[00:14:55.940 --> 00:15:00.620]   That's wonderful and a truly amazing revolution for them.
[00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:03.780]   And so at some point people get hooked.
[00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:07.580]   And then what happens is once they get hooked then they start to communicate in different
[00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:11.540]   platforms and they start to not notice that these different platforms are all doing the
[00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:12.960]   same thing.
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:17.660]   For example, I remember when my dad got WhatsApp, right?
[00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:24.740]   My dad's in his mid-70s and he wanted to communicate with people in Africa and in Asia and they
[00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:25.900]   communicate on WhatsApp.
[00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:27.460]   So he downloaded WhatsApp.
[00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:33.140]   And so now though that's his most used communications platform and it works really, really well.
[00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:39.860]   So you'll have even relatively old people like my parents who will communicate without
[00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:44.900]   any problem on WhatsApp and then they've got Facebook Messenger and they've got Telegram
[00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:52.140]   and they've got Signal and they're just kind of now we live in this milieu of applications,
[00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:58.580]   this just world of applications and we basically view them as in some ways totally fungible.
[00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:02.420]   There are people that I communicate with on whatever platform happens to be convenient.
[00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:05.780]   Sometimes Messenger, sometimes iMessaging, sometimes WhatsApp, sometimes Signal, doesn't
[00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:06.940]   really matter.
[00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:11.820]   And it just becomes a utility and we all use this utility.
[00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:19.380]   Now over time the culture and the population can change but it takes more time for a population
[00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:23.860]   that's used to doing something an old way to change than it does for a population that's
[00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:27.620]   embracing the technology for the first new time.
[00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:34.620]   Now there are still people who cannot imagine not having a phone, not imagine not having
[00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:36.160]   a phone number.
[00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:41.820]   But a lot of us, right, I don't even pay any attention to the phone number of a phone,
[00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:43.460]   or at least I didn't used to.
[00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:50.340]   I have found that I've had to reinsert phones into my life in order to deal with SMS, two-factor
[00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:55.540]   authentication properly and deal with banks and credit card companies, etc.
[00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:59.020]   But if you can solve that in another way, which of course there are other ways to solve
[00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:01.460]   it, the need for a phone is diminished.
[00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:03.700]   You just have a communications device.
[00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:05.140]   And yet people don't really notice this.
[00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:08.540]   Now let's turn to money because I want to apply this to money because I think it's a
[00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:14.740]   useful metaphor that more or less touches on what I think is going to happen in the
[00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:17.400]   future with the way that we do money.
[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:25.340]   At its core, WhatsApp and other platforms, they simply solve one human need, which is
[00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:28.060]   communication.
[00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:33.060]   And they facilitate different and interesting ways to communicate.
[00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:40.820]   Even though video calling, they facilitate different ways and whether you use them or
[00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:42.660]   not is up to you.
[00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:48.700]   Video calling, back in the day, you had this incredible futuristic idea that you would
[00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:53.140]   do a video call with somebody and that was going to be cool.
[00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:58.220]   Then it happened and now almost anybody can do a video call on virtually any of these
[00:17:58.220 --> 00:17:59.220]   platforms.
[00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:01.780]   I personally though almost never use them.
[00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:06.940]   I would just prefer just to talk instead of deal with the video.
[00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:10.460]   But the technology is there and then people choose what they access and what they don't
[00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:11.460]   access.
[00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:15.020]   So money solves a similar function.
[00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:22.660]   Money provides a system of accounting so that people can exchange value for value one with
[00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:24.500]   another.
[00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:32.420]   Just like a telephone or the postal service or any of these facilitate communication,
[00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:34.540]   money facilitates transactions.
[00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:36.220]   It facilitates trade.
[00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:39.820]   It facilitates transfers of value.
[00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:49.700]   Now in many systems, such as the United States of America, you have a large, solid, relatively
[00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:53.000]   well-run money system.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.900]   You have the benefit, by way of metaphor, of having the entire country crisscrossed
[00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:00.820]   with cables.
[00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:07.720]   But just because that's the way things are right now doesn't mean that's the way that
[00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:11.460]   things will be in the near future.
[00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:14.400]   Just because that's the way things are right now doesn't mean that's the way things are
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:16.940]   in other places in the world.
[00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:20.260]   And just because that's the way things are right now doesn't mean that that's the way
[00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:25.140]   things will be ten years from now.
[00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:33.020]   In the same way that you've had a revolution in communications that's happened right during
[00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:41.100]   your lifetime, over the last ten to twenty years, I think it's very probable that you
[00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:48.260]   will see a similar revolution in the way that we think about money.
[00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:56.380]   And I think that if you don't see that, think a little bit more about my WhatsApp example.
[00:19:56.380 --> 00:20:01.540]   It's hard for me to imagine anybody in my listening audience that doesn't regularly
[00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:07.580]   communicate on some application that's not the telephone.
[00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:13.460]   And the telephone is still there in the background, but most of the communication now happens
[00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:14.900]   in another context.
[00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:25.420]   Well I think in that similar way, that change, that diversity, that changing technology is
[00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:30.340]   going to come to the way that we think about money, to the way that we use money, etc.
[00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:34.660]   Now for early adopters, there are already options.
[00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:42.180]   You can today live in the United States and run your entire life on the British pound.
[00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:45.420]   That would of course be unusual, but you can do that.
[00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:51.820]   And here's where you see this incredible intersection between the communications technology and
[00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:54.100]   the way that we use money.
[00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:59.220]   Right now, you can use other currencies in your life, and I recommend it.
[00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:00.700]   I think it's a good idea.
[00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:07.380]   When I travel around the world, my primary form of payment is a credit card, and most
[00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:12.420]   of the time it's a credit card just simply run through Apple Pay.
[00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:18.180]   The single most convenient way for me to buy something all around the world is by double
[00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:22.860]   tapping the button on the side of my Apple Watch and holding it over the credit card
[00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:26.180]   reader and moving on with my day.
[00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:28.780]   It's a phenomenal system.
[00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:36.220]   And if that particular credit card merchant doesn't have a touchless credit card reader,
[00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:39.900]   then of course I'll use a physical credit card.
[00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:41.500]   But it's a phenomenal system.
[00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:46.580]   That touchless system right on my watch or right on a phone works really, really well.
[00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:50.620]   I can't use that system very much in the United States because the United States is significantly
[00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:55.300]   behind the curve in contactless credit card readers.
[00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:59.980]   But I can use it regularly around the world, even in restaurants and things like that,
[00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:04.120]   where usually they bring out the point of service terminal to your table and they punch
[00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:07.180]   the numbers in, you hold your watch over it and boom, you're done.
[00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:08.500]   Now why do I do that?
[00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:13.820]   Well, because it's annoying to do foreign currency transactions.
[00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:17.220]   I don't know how much money I'm going to need in, right now I'm in Costa Rica, the Costa
[00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:18.220]   Rican Cologne.
[00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:20.740]   I don't know how many colones I'm going to need.
[00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:28.000]   And if I go and take out and I convert US dollars into colones, I have to take my passport
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.500]   into a bank, they have to register me in a system, they give me a conversion rate.
[00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:37.260]   I don't know what the conversion rate is fair on their buy-sell spread, it's a real hassle.
[00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:41.140]   And what if I'm in Costa Rica one day and Panama the next and Mexico the third, it's
[00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:44.380]   just a hassle to keep all that stuff straight and make sure I'm being treated honestly,
[00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:46.340]   it's expensive.
[00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:51.500]   Even in terms of spending it, right, I can't really relate very well to what the value
[00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:53.700]   of the Costa Rican Cologne is.
[00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:59.540]   But I know that as soon as I, you know, swipe my Amex, then about 10 minutes later there's
[00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:06.020]   going to be a notification pop up on my phone, "Oh Joshua, you spent $13 on such and such
[00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:07.020]   a thing."
[00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:09.820]   Oh great, now I can convert it into something that I have a reference for.
[00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:14.540]   I have no reference for the Costa Rican Cologne, I have a reference for the US dollar though.
[00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:19.820]   And so everything is facilitated and it's cheaper for me and easier for me just to swipe
[00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:25.060]   my credit cards wherever I go around the world.
[00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:28.420]   That's a very different system than there was 20 years ago when you traveled with traveler's
[00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:32.900]   checks and you didn't have credit cards that had, it was hard to find a credit card that
[00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:35.340]   had a no transaction fee, etc.
[00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:37.500]   But today that system is better.
[00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:40.860]   Now I can do exactly the same thing with other currencies.
[00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:47.340]   If I have a, again, a British bank account or a Canadian bank account or a Mongolian
[00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:53.300]   bank account, as long as they offer me that card, I can use the same card and it works
[00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:54.300]   the same.
[00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:57.860]   I know the British is hard because they have a lot of foreign transaction fees, but there
[00:23:57.860 --> 00:23:59.980]   are options in almost any country.
[00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:04.900]   And so in a lot of ways it doesn't really matter what my money is held in.
[00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:07.340]   Now of course dollars work well for me.
[00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:12.460]   I earn in dollars, I spend in dollars, but all I'm doing is just trying to get something.
[00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:14.700]   I'm just trying to buy something.
[00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:19.220]   Now I've been testing a couple of the new offerings that allow you to spend cryptocurrency
[00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:21.220]   directly with a card.
[00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:22.860]   Pretty remarkable, right?
[00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:28.580]   You can have a Bitcoin wallet and a debit card that will simply take from that Bitcoin
[00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:32.700]   wallet and you swipe your debit card, boom, it pays.
[00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:36.780]   It's loaded into my Apple Watch app or on Apple Pay on my phone.
[00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:38.420]   Double click, boom, here we go.
[00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:43.040]   I just used Bitcoin to pay for something at a point of service terminal, anywhere that
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:44.260]   a credit card is accepted.
[00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:45.620]   It's remarkable.
[00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:51.020]   And we're living in just the beginning stages of this changing world.
[00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:57.700]   So my point here is that the technology, this technology is superior.
[00:24:57.700 --> 00:24:59.900]   I'm not blind to the benefits of cash.
[00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:05.420]   I'm the guy who in 2018 I tried to conduct an experiment and I tried to move as many
[00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:09.220]   of my personal transactions 100% to cash as possible.
[00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:13.460]   I didn't swipe a card or a debit card or a credit card to pay for anything the entire
[00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:14.460]   year.
[00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:15.460]   And so I've tested that.
[00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:19.260]   But I'm here to tell you as someone who's done that, living on cash is dead, right?
[00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:20.260]   That's the past.
[00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:23.100]   It's so difficult to do in today's world.
[00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:24.700]   It's so difficult.
[00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:29.340]   So the future though is not really even cards.
[00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:32.580]   The future is digital signals and apps.
[00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:38.780]   I don't know many, I don't know what percentage, but many of the messaging apps now as a built-in
[00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:45.500]   feature allow you to use, to transfer money immediately from one person to another.
[00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:48.800]   Sometimes this is with an external app, a Venmo, a PayPal.
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:54.380]   Sometimes it's using directly Apple Pay, Apple Cash, and iMessaging or whatever other options
[00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:55.580]   that you have.
[00:25:55.580 --> 00:26:00.900]   But these options are here, they're now, and they're better.
[00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:03.660]   Most of my audience lives in the United States.
[00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:09.100]   My reason for telling you this is just because you don't use this stuff on a daily basis
[00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:11.300]   doesn't mean that this is being used.
[00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:14.620]   This is not being used on a daily basis.
[00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:20.900]   The United States of America is very unlikely to be the determined, the culture of the United
[00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:27.780]   States of America is very unlikely to be the determining factor of what happens in things
[00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:35.180]   like payment technologies, currency use, etc. in the coming years.
[00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:37.700]   Why?
[00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:42.460]   I think largely it comes down to population and the fact that most US Americans don't
[00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:44.700]   see a reason to change.
[00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:49.940]   Now the United States is very good at creating technologists, people who can build something
[00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:50.940]   new.
[00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:57.780]   Many of the technologies that I have described have been built by and created by US Americans.
[00:26:57.780 --> 00:27:05.700]   The United States of America has a very proud history of inventors, creators, etc.
[00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:11.360]   But at this point in time, even the whole system of creation is being democratized globally.
[00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:19.660]   Right now, because for the first time in history you can sit at your house in Bangladesh and
[00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:25.780]   you can learn to code every bit as well using the instructional content that's available
[00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:30.780]   on the internet, using the relevant forums for your coding language, for your application,
[00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:31.780]   etc.
[00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:37.420]   You can be every bit as good of a coder as somebody who's gone to a prestigious US American
[00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:42.340]   university, which means that you can create products, you can create services, and now
[00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:48.420]   all of a sudden you need a system that you're not locked out of.
[00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:53.800]   You need a way to have access to a high quality bank account where you can store your money.
[00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:58.060]   You need a way to process payments for people who want to purchase your services from around
[00:27:58.060 --> 00:27:59.060]   the world.
[00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:05.500]   And you need to do it without one country or a few countries controlling all of your
[00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:09.260]   transactions saying "oh no, we're going to flag you because you're from Bangladesh and
[00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:11.460]   we don't know how to process you".
[00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:16.820]   You need entirely new systems of credit checks and risk profiles.
[00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:21.860]   And the way that things are done in the United States doesn't serve the people of Bangladesh
[00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:26.180]   very well.
[00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:33.240]   I'm not talking this through to try to argue that the United States of America is going
[00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:37.700]   to disappear or in decline, or the US dollar is going to be declared worthless.
[00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:43.260]   What I'm articulating is simply that trends are going to change around the world, and
[00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:48.500]   they're changing faster than ever before, and these trends are going to affect your
[00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:50.380]   money.
[00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:56.060]   These trends are going to be things that are affecting how you do business.
[00:28:56.060 --> 00:29:03.280]   Know it or not, the people who latched onto WhatsApp in Africa, Latin America, Southeast
[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:07.360]   Asia, those people have transformed your life.
[00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:09.220]   Because there was a kickback effect.
[00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:15.260]   You may have always used iMessaging, and iMessaging is awesome.
[00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:20.360]   But then iMessaging started to incorporate more features that you saw on WhatsApp first.
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:23.680]   Then of course Facebook owns WhatsApp, you had Facebook Messenger change, and all these
[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:25.180]   things are changing.
[00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:30.040]   But it's not the population of the United States that drove these trends, it was the
[00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:32.520]   population of many countries around the world.
[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:36.780]   I want to talk about population figures for a moment, because this is something that most
[00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:40.320]   people don't pay attention to, because many people don't travel.
[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:45.440]   But let's talk about the population of some of the largest countries in the world.
[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:55.440]   The current population, obviously, is China, which currently has a population of 1.4 billion
[00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:56.620]   people.
[00:29:56.620 --> 00:30:01.060]   That is 17.9% of the global population.
[00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:06.880]   The second largest country in the world, according to current estimates, is India, which has
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:16.460]   a current population of 1.37 billion people, that is 17.5% of the world's population.
[00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:25.080]   The Chinese population and the Indian populations are going to make a massive impact on your
[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:33.080]   life, assuming that you're not Chinese or Indian, simply because of their size.
[00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:42.400]   And as so many of our communication technology is connected, you cannot have that many people
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:47.640]   who have access to all of the knowledge of the world, who don't then wind up creating
[00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:53.380]   new products, new services, new trends that affect the rest of the world massively.
[00:30:53.380 --> 00:31:00.520]   Between China and India, you have two nations that represent something like 35% of the world's
[00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:03.800]   population.
[00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:09.120]   Again China, 1.41 billion people, 17.9% of the world's population.
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:14.760]   India 1.37 billion people, 17.5% of the world's population.
[00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:20.760]   The third largest country in the world, measured by population, is the United States.
[00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:28.560]   The United States has a population of 331 million people, which represents 4.21% of
[00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:31.120]   the world's population.
[00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:39.680]   Obviously, the United States has a massive influence on global legal systems, global
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:41.400]   culture, etc.
[00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:46.840]   The United States has punched well above its weight economically for a very, very long
[00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:50.360]   time.
[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:57.560]   That influence is likely to continue for a significant period of time.
[00:31:57.560 --> 00:32:05.320]   But that influence, and again, much of my audience is US American, that influence is
[00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:09.560]   not guaranteed to continue.
[00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:15.840]   There is this, I don't know if it's a popular saying or just a perception, that it's not
[00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:19.000]   wise to bet against America.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.520]   And I think there's a real grain of truth in that.
[00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:25.760]   It's not wise to bet against America.
[00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:32.560]   The United States, throughout its history, has accomplished some incredible things.
[00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:38.560]   However, just because somebody has accomplished incredible things doesn't mean that they're
[00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:41.680]   going to continue to dominate.
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:46.200]   And I think that you see very clearly, at least I see very clearly, that the global
[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:52.520]   dominance of the United States of America is waning.
[00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:56.200]   Whether it's waning quickly or slowly, I don't know, but it is waning.
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:33:00.760]   And I think there are a number of reasons for that.
[00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:05.600]   Whether or not that remains true, time will tell.
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:07.120]   But go and think about other empires.
[00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:14.400]   To me, my favorite empire to think about is that of the British Empire.
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:18.040]   There was a day when the sun did not set on the British Empire.
[00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:25.400]   You had this huge global empire, absolutely massive.
[00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:31.600]   And yet, very, very quickly, all throughout the 1900s, that empire systematically collapsed.
[00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:37.800]   Now, that collapse was not precipitous and calamitous in the sense that all of a sudden
[00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:41.760]   the United Kingdom just became the worst place in the world to be and people were shooting
[00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:43.200]   each other in the streets necessarily.
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:47.240]   It wasn't that kind of thing, but there was a tremendous collapse.
[00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:56.240]   Today, when measured, you have the United Kingdom falling in 21st in terms of the world
[00:33:56.240 --> 00:34:03.080]   population number, 67.1 million people, representing 0.85% of the population.
[00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:05.840]   Now, the economic rankings of countries is different.
[00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:09.200]   We'll come to that in a moment, but I want to finish this population rankings because
[00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:13.640]   when you're looking at trends, you're thinking about trends like I'm alluding to, talking
[00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:21.640]   about finance trends, banking trends, investment trends, currency trends, adoption of cryptocurrencies
[00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:26.400]   or the decentralized finance space, the DeFi space, etc.
[00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:29.760]   My point is population is going to tell a big factor.
[00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:33.360]   Most people in the United States have not been looking for solutions to their financial
[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:34.920]   problems.
[00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:40.920]   Most people in the United States have been pretty well served with most aspects of their
[00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:41.920]   finances.
[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:46.800]   It's been relatively easy for US Americans to get a bank account.
[00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:51.320]   Although the United States has very high levels of bank failures compared to some other countries,
[00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:56.120]   generally, the concept of bank failure is not something that US Americans think much
[00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:57.120]   about.
[00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:59.560]   They just assume it's all going to work out and the regulators are going to take care
[00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:00.560]   of it.
[00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:06.240]   The US dollar, while massively inflationary, has been less massively inflationary than
[00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:10.360]   other currencies and with the military power and the economic power of the United States
[00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:14.880]   of America, the US dollar has been king for a very long period of time.
[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:22.400]   Most US Americans have never earned or banked in anything other than the US dollar.
[00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:26.120]   US Americans have generally had access to pretty convenient ways to spend their money.
[00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:30.840]   They had access to check systems and they could write checks to people and have check
[00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:33.520]   verification and access to credit cards.
[00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:37.760]   Today, still the best market in the world for credit card consumers is the United States
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:38.760]   of America.
[00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:43.040]   It's a tremendous option, the benefits, the perks, etc. that you get with your credit
[00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:44.520]   cards.
[00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:49.360]   From an investment perspective, the United States of America has featured robust investment
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:50.360]   markets.
[00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:56.600]   Some tremendously powerful and brilliant people have been developing new ways to invest and
[00:35:56.600 --> 00:36:06.120]   great academic researchers and very smart investment managers enabling those things,
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:09.800]   people building companies and just really good stuff.
[00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:12.880]   Some of the lowest investment fees that you'll pay anywhere in the world are in the United
[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:14.360]   States of America.
[00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:18.280]   And so most US Americans look at the world and they say, "Look, everything's working
[00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:19.480]   pretty well.
[00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:20.480]   Everything is good.
[00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:23.320]   I've got all my needs met and so things will probably continue."
[00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:26.440]   And also they'll say, "Well, you know what?
[00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:31.480]   If the rest of the world changes, they're going to change to be just like us."
[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:33.720]   I don't believe that.
[00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:36.720]   I don't believe that.
[00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:40.160]   If the rest of the world changes, they're not going to try to build the US American
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:43.440]   systems because what's the reality of the US American systems?
[00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:47.280]   Realistically, point of service terminals are expensive.
[00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:48.560]   Charge a merchant a few percent.
[00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:51.800]   That's where your credit card rewards come from.
[00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:57.120]   Realistically, bank accounts are very hard to get, especially in the wake since 2001
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:00.440]   with the Patriot Act and a few years after.
[00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:04.800]   It's very hard to get a bank account.
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:07.160]   Payment transfers are very expensive.
[00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:11.920]   And if you are a Mexican guy working in the United States trying to send money home to
[00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:20.000]   your family in Mexico doing remittances, the fees from Western Union and whatnot are exorbitant,
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.200]   massive.
[00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:24.400]   Interest rates in the United States can be very, very high.
[00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:30.480]   Credit card interest rates, 19.9%, 29.9%.
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:39.040]   And so while on the whole the system is relatively stable, those problems are still there.
[00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:46.960]   If you're on a watch list of some kind, you can't get a bank account or you can't get
[00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:50.520]   a merchant account, it's real problems.
[00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:55.040]   Now pretend that you're trying to run a business in Nigeria.
[00:37:55.040 --> 00:38:00.800]   Nigeria number seven, 211 million people representing 2.69% of the world's population.
[00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:06.480]   Growing population, not a declining population like the United States.
[00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:12.320]   Nigeria is a powerhouse and yet it's tremendously difficult for Nigerians to interact with the
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:20.240]   world because of the broad brush of fraud and scams, et cetera, that are drawn over
[00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:24.760]   all Nigerians.
[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:32.920]   The 331 million people, the 4.21% of the world, those consumers are not going to set the future
[00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:34.320]   of consumption.
[00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:37.440]   There might be some very smart companies, some very smart people that come out of that
[00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:38.440]   4.2%.
[00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:43.080]   I expect the United States to continue to be extraordinarily influential in the coming
[00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:44.080]   decades.
[00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:47.760]   But the consumer trends, the use of how do we buy and sell with each other?
[00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:49.560]   How do we send money to one another?
[00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:54.440]   Do we do it in a centralized way or do we do it in a decentralized way?
[00:38:54.440 --> 00:39:00.560]   It's going to be the rest of the world's consumers that make those decisions.
[00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:08.280]   Think about this, Indonesia has 271 million people, 3.45%.
[00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:11.160]   That's the fourth largest country in the world.
[00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:17.040]   Do you have any concept of what the major trends are in Indonesia as a US American or
[00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:20.480]   as a Canadian?
[00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:27.040]   From an economic GDP perspective, Indonesia is far less powerful and influential than
[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:30.440]   the United States of America.
[00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:36.240]   But that's changing and from a population perspective, Indonesia is an extraordinarily
[00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:39.400]   large and powerful country.
[00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:44.360]   Pakistan is number five, 225 million people or 2.86% of the world's population.
[00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:48.000]   Brazil, number six, 213 million people.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.200]   Nigeria, 211 million people.
[00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:52.520]   Bangladesh, 170 million people.
[00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:55.600]   Russia, 146 million people.
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:59.400]   Mexico, 126 million people.
[00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:00.960]   And the list goes on and on.
[00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:06.200]   Ethiopia, Ethiopia is number 12 with 117 million people.
[00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:08.880]   Here's what's fascinating about Ethiopia.
[00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:16.560]   The median age of the citizens and residents of Ethiopia, the median age, remember median
[00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:20.680]   means 50% are lower and 50% are higher.
[00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:29.800]   The median age of men and women, boys and girls living in Ethiopia is 20.
[00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:38.520]   50% of everyone in Ethiopia is under the age of 20.
[00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:52.280]   Imagine a culture where 50% of your population is under the age of 20 and yet you have 118
[00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:56.200]   million people.
[00:40:56.200 --> 00:41:01.320]   Do you think that all of those people are going to sit back and say, "You know what?
[00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:04.780]   We're going to just accept the world the way it is."
[00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:10.840]   Think about all of the people that you know who are under 20 and how they view the world
[00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:14.520]   and some of the things that you think are totally normal that they think would be totally
[00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:15.520]   crazy.
[00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:17.440]   "You mean I can't pay with my watch?
[00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:18.440]   Are you kidding me?
[00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:19.440]   Why wouldn't I?
[00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:21.200]   What's the point?"
[00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:27.640]   I am increasingly convinced that for my children, by the time they reach their teenage years,
[00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:36.120]   the concept that they should only earn their money in one currency, the US dollar, will
[00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:43.360]   probably sound as strange to them as the idea does to me that I have to send you a fax.
[00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:46.240]   "I have to send you a fax?
[00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:48.200]   Are you kidding me?
[00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:52.680]   Why would I send you a fax?"
[00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:55.000]   I think that's where the world is going.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:58.680]   I think that these technological changes are changing.
[00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:02.920]   And the beauty of this, you can take this and say, "Oh, it's scary.
[00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:04.400]   I may not understand."
[00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:08.540]   The beauty of this is that the consumers get to decide.
[00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:10.400]   You and I don't get to decide.
[00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:15.160]   The people with all the guns don't necessarily get to decide, at least not in the long term.
[00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:17.360]   The consumers get to decide.
[00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:19.280]   The people who say, "You know what?
[00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:20.360]   I'll take this.
[00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:21.640]   I'll absorb this.
[00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:25.200]   I'll make this happen."
[00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:30.120]   We're living in a time of tremendous change.
[00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:33.280]   But it's change for the good.
[00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:36.380]   Things are getting better.
[00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:46.840]   The trends are towards decentralization, transparency, costs are going down, services going up.
[00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:52.080]   And the competition that we live in, the world of competition, is creating ways for all of
[00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:54.960]   us to win.
[00:42:54.960 --> 00:43:02.700]   As much as I appreciate many of the benefits of cash, I'm one of those who does.
[00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:10.760]   As much as I appreciate the many benefits of being able to spend cash, my life is better
[00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:13.340]   with being able to do everything digitally.
[00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:19.480]   The fact that I can wander around the world and have a very low cost banking system that
[00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:26.560]   allows me to, again, with my phone or with my watch, spend off of up to, I think my limit
[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:27.560]   is 12, right?
[00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:29.800]   12 or 10, maybe it's 10.
[00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:34.520]   I can spend off of 10 different credit cards just with one little thing.
[00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:40.160]   And I can spend with any currency that my credit cards are connected to.
[00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:42.480]   I can spend with US dollars off this credit card.
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:44.200]   I can spend Canadian dollars off that one.
[00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:45.920]   I can spend British pounds off the third.
[00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:47.360]   I can spend euros off the fourth.
[00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:51.800]   I can spend Bitcoin off the fifth.
[00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:55.360]   This is awesome.
[00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:57.560]   It's really cool.
[00:43:57.560 --> 00:44:03.680]   So in closing, I wanted to try to bring a little bit of perspective to my largely Western
[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:06.400]   audience.
[00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:13.160]   I want you to think about my little metaphor of WhatsApp and just consider it.
[00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:18.120]   Because if you are living in the United States of America, you're used to working under a
[00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:23.080]   certain system, then it can be hard to see these changes.
[00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:27.480]   But I think if you consider my little parable of WhatsApp, then perhaps it will help you
[00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:29.800]   to see that things are changing.
[00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:34.640]   Today, this WhatsApp parable was probably more powerful two years ago when it wasn't
[00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:35.640]   as popular.
[00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:39.760]   Today, I would guess that most, I don't know, it just seems like so many US Americans
[00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:40.760]   even would use WhatsApp.
[00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:47.840]   If you don't use WhatsApp, you use Facebook Messenger or Signal or some messaging app.
[00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:51.520]   And more and more, more of your communication is there.
[00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:58.920]   If it's not Signal or WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger, it's Basecamp or Asana or blanking
[00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:00.960]   on the other names, Slack.
[00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:02.660]   This is how you're communicating.
[00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:05.820]   It's not with the old legacy systems.
[00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:10.900]   And I'm convinced that's going to affect money and the way that we deal with money.
[00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:16.480]   It's going to affect fiat currencies, the power of fiat currencies versus other things.
[00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:19.180]   It's going to affect all kinds of things.
[00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:22.020]   And it's going to be an exciting ride.
[00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:26.740]   I'm not making any prognostication about the price of Bitcoin, you know, 10 years from
[00:45:26.740 --> 00:45:28.580]   now.
[00:45:28.580 --> 00:45:29.580]   The world is changing.
[00:45:29.580 --> 00:45:33.980]   Bitcoin will be a major factor of that, but the world is changing.
[00:45:33.980 --> 00:45:36.020]   And so, pay attention.
[00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:41.560]   Now whenever there's change, last bit of my closing charge, whenever there is change,
[00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:44.520]   you have opportunity.
[00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:52.800]   The way to get rich is to figure out where money is moving and then put yourself in the
[00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:56.780]   way of it and scoop some up.
[00:45:56.780 --> 00:45:57.780]   That's how you get rich.
[00:45:57.780 --> 00:46:01.900]   Figure out where is money moving and then put yourself in the way of it and scoop some
[00:46:01.900 --> 00:46:03.500]   up.
[00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:08.300]   So when you see trends, when you see changes, that means opportunity.
[00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:11.600]   I don't know what your opportunities are.
[00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:16.980]   Maybe you're going to become a programmer and start building an interesting application
[00:46:16.980 --> 00:46:20.180]   that solves a specific problem for a guy living in Nigeria.
[00:46:20.180 --> 00:46:22.220]   I don't know.
[00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:25.380]   Maybe you're going to invest into Ethereum.
[00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:26.380]   I don't know.
[00:46:26.380 --> 00:46:30.420]   The point is that when you see change, change creates opportunity.
[00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:34.340]   So pay attention to it and try to find a way that you can be involved in the change.
[00:46:34.340 --> 00:46:38.860]   To me, I think the trends at this point are pretty obvious, that the world is changing
[00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:40.980]   because the solutions are better.
[00:46:40.980 --> 00:46:45.500]   I don't want to go back to a system of landline telephones.
[00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:47.620]   I don't want to go back to fax machines.
[00:46:47.620 --> 00:46:49.740]   I don't want to go back to a telegraph machine.
[00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:59.660]   I don't want to go back to counting minutes in text messages on a phone.
[00:46:59.660 --> 00:47:07.260]   I'm excited to go forward into the next thing because your and my lives have been dramatically
[00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:09.780]   improved by these technologies.
[00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:15.140]   So the same thing is going to happen to money in the coming days and it's a trend for the
[00:47:15.140 --> 00:47:16.140]   good.
[00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:17.180]   Don't be surprised by it.
[00:47:17.180 --> 00:47:18.180]   Pay attention to it.
[00:47:18.180 --> 00:47:19.180]   Move wisely.
[00:47:19.180 --> 00:47:24.260]   Don't make any rash changes, but pay attention to these trends.
[00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:26.920]   (pensive music)
