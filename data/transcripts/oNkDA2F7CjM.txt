[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Guest Series,
[00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.120]   where I and an expert guest discuss science
[00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.320]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.600]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.360]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.200]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.560]   Today's episode is the third in the sixth episode series
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.060]   on fitness, exercise, and performance.
[00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.120]   Today's episode is all about endurance and fat loss.
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.360]   That is the specific protocols required
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.720]   to achieve the four different kinds of endurance
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.380]   and how to maximize fat loss.
[00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.360]   Dr. Andy Galpin, great to be back.
[00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.160]   Today, we're going to talk about endurance,
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.020]   and I'm very interested in this conversation
[00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.680]   because I, like many other people,
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.120]   strive to get a certain amount
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.680]   of cardiovascular work in each week,
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.760]   maybe a long-ish jog, maybe a swim, ride the bike, et cetera.
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.360]   But when I think about the word endurance,
[00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.480]   the idea that almost immediately comes to mind
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.240]   is about doing something for a long period of time,
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.080]   repeatedly, but I have a feeling
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.960]   that there are other ways to trigger this adaptation
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.200]   that we call the endurance adaptation.
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.360]   I'm excited to learn about that.
[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.600]   I'm also excited to learn about the fuel systems
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.360]   in the body that allow for endurance
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.760]   and other modes of repeated activity.
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.620]   So in order to kick things off,
[00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.880]   I'd love for you to frame the conversation
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.800]   by telling us what is endurance,
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.960]   and are there indeed a large variety of ways
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.100]   to induce what we call this endurance adaptation?
[00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.880]   - Sure, the way I want to start actually here
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.600]   is calling back to some of the things
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.320]   we talked about in our previous conversations,
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.820]   which are really, people exercise for three reasons.
[00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.140]   Number one, you want to feel better.
[00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.240]   Number two, you want to look a certain way.
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.200]   And then number three, you want to be able
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.740]   to do that for a long time, right?
[00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.840]   So you need, the way that we say it in sports
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.760]   is look good, feel good, play good, right?
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.320]   So I want some sort of functionality
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.700]   to be able to perform a certain way,
[00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.360]   whatever that is, for you.
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.620]   You want to be able to look a certain way,
[00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:54.460]   that whatever that matters for you,
[00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.720]   and then you want to be able to do that for a long time.
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:57.840]   So when it comes to endurance,
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.160]   we have a bunch of misnomers here,
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.600]   which is the same thing with the strength training
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.980]   or resistance exercise side,
[00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.640]   where we wanted to dispel this myth that,
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.440]   I lift weights only because I want to gain muscle
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.880]   or play a sport.
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.340]   And I want to do cardio because I want to either lose fat
[00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.400]   or for long health's sake.
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.080]   And just like we smashed that myth
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.040]   from the strength training side,
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.200]   I want to smash it from the endurance training side.
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.600]   There are so many other reasons
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.760]   that you want to perform endurance training.
[00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.180]   Regardless of your goal, right?
[00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.420]   Whether it is longevity, whether it is performance,
[00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:30.520]   or whether it is aesthetics.
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.980]   And so I want to cover all those reasons,
[00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.700]   exactly what to do, protocols of course,
[00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.280]   and why those things are working that way.
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.440]   In general though, the quick answer is,
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.520]   really endurance comes down to two independent factors.
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.720]   Factor number one is fatigue management,
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.780]   and then factor number two is fueling.
[00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.320]   And that's all it really comes down to.
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.600]   So all the different types of training
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.020]   are going to reach a limitation,
[00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.440]   which are either again,
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.580]   your ability to deal with some sort of fatigue,
[00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.280]   and that's generally a fatigue signal.
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.360]   The other one is managing some sort of restriction
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.320]   of energy input.
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.660]   And a lot of, the spoiler here is,
[00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.840]   a lot of the times people think it's a fueling issue
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.840]   and really it's a fatigue management issue, or the opposite.
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.160]   And to have a complete health spectrum,
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.220]   regardless of whether you're a high performance athlete
[00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.920]   like I typically deal with, or general public,
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.680]   you need to be able to do both.
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.320]   Manage fatigue, as well as understand fuel storage.
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.720]   So that's really what we're going to get into today.
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.340]   - Fantastic, I can't wait.
[00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.920]   Before we dive in, I'm going to ask you
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.080]   what I often ask people who are expert
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.920]   in their respective fields, which is,
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.360]   is there any non-obvious tool,
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.640]   or mechanism, or tool and mechanism
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.280]   that can allow people to access better endurance?
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.760]   You know, when I think about training for endurance,
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.920]   again, I think about trying to run longer and longer
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.700]   each week, or swim further and further, and so on.
[00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.540]   But I do wonder whether or not there are other forms
[00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.540]   of training that can amplify the endurance adaptation
[00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.780]   that I or most people perhaps don't think of as endurance.
[00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.760]   - Sure, the way I want to answer this is,
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.000]   if we look back and think about how we've answered
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.760]   that question with power and strength, and force production,
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.760]   it is really about how much can you produce maximally once.
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.560]   What you're asking now is, how can I repeat
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.680]   that same quality of performance?
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.640]   If that's the case, endurance really comes down
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.300]   to your ability to maintain proper mechanics.
[00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.480]   That's going to, like the biggest way we can increase
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.660]   your endurance exponentially, very quickly, is mechanical.
[00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.580]   And this is starting with breathing.
[00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.160]   And so we need to be breathing properly,
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.200]   we need to have proper posture and positions,
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.760]   and then we need to be moving well.
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.760]   Efficiency is going to trump force, always, for endurance.
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.040]   The other side of the equation is not that.
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.680]   You can have a little bit of leaks in your mechanics
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.800]   and still squat well or jump high and be fine,
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.040]   because you don't have to suffer
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.240]   those consequences repeatedly, right?
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.780]   That's going to drain you over time.
[00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.920]   So the quickest way to improve endurance
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.800]   is to improve mechanics.
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.560]   And the mechanical thing I would go after first
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.200]   is your breathing techniques, your pattern,
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.080]   your entire approach, as well as your posture.
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.320]   And then from there, the third one
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.040]   would be your movement technique.
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.960]   - Is it possible to describe the best way to breathe
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.280]   when doing endurance training,
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.720]   or is it far more complex than that?
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.200]   And if it is far more complex than that,
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.000]   then certainly we can get into it during today's episode.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.420]   - Yeah, it is, both of those.
[00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:37.800]   I will give you a quick answer though.
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.260]   A lot of the times you can kind of hit the cheat code,
[00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:42.640]   which is nasal breathing.
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.960]   There's plenty of times when you don't want a nasal breathe,
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.300]   you don't need to nasal breathe.
[00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.840]   But just, again, is that like a one tool
[00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.540]   that is a pretty general answer?
[00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.880]   If you can do that, a lot of the times
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.360]   that will fix breathing mechanics, just by default.
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.180]   And we can maybe talk about why that is later,
[00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.960]   but that would be my sort of one sentence bullet point
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.660]   answer immediately of how to get in the right position.
[00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:07.380]   So the second one would be simply looking at your posture.
[00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.400]   So whether you're on a bike or you're doing a lift
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.520]   or you're running, if you're literally hunched over
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.800]   and your ribs are touching your femur
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.100]   or getting closer and closer,
[00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.720]   like tends to happen on a bike or an air assault thing
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.660]   for somebody I've seen recently.
[00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:26.460]   - This morning, I was on the assault bike doing a sprint
[00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:31.120]   and I asked Andy, Dr. Galpin, to critique my form
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.060]   and anything else he wanted to critique
[00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:34.380]   so that I could improve.
[00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.820]   And he did comment on my rather C-shaped posture,
[00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:39.680]   encouraged me to be more upright,
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.520]   which I should probably do now as well.
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.220]   And he also cued me to the fact
[00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:44.700]   that during a one minute sprint,
[00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:46.980]   there is something that is quote unquote magic
[00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:49.180]   that happens right about the 40 second mark.
[00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:53.380]   And I use that as a milestone to look for.
[00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:56.340]   And indeed something does happen at the 40 seconds
[00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:58.720]   into a one minute sprint where all of a sudden
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.420]   it does seem to get much easier
[00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:02.460]   for reasons I don't understand.
[00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:03.580]   Maybe you can tell me that,
[00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:05.160]   but it certainly had nothing to do with my posture.
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.340]   My posture needs improvement.
[00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:07.180]   Thank you.
[00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:11.180]   - Yeah, so breathing mechanics and breathing strategies.
[00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:14.340]   People tend to be over-breathing early on.
[00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:16.260]   And this is gonna lead to problems later.
[00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:20.020]   So having a more strategic breathing pattern
[00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:22.860]   and approach is, again, a very quick solution.
[00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:24.700]   - I know that we're going to dive very deep
[00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:28.740]   into the mechanisms of energy and metabolism
[00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:30.340]   and endurance today.
[00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:32.620]   But as long as we're having a discussion
[00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:35.260]   about these brief sort of tidbits
[00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.520]   of how to improve endurance,
[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:39.900]   are there any other ways to improve endurance
[00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:43.180]   that are of relatively short time investment,
[00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:46.740]   even if they require a lot of energy?
[00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:47.580]   - Sure.
[00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:49.540]   The classic paradigm you're gonna find here
[00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:52.660]   is steady state long duration,
[00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:54.220]   posed up against what a lot of folks
[00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:56.220]   will now call higher intensity,
[00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:57.820]   interval training specifically.
[00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:00.060]   And there's a lot of misconceptions here.
[00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:01.840]   The quick answer is you need to be doing both.
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:03.780]   And there's probably a bunch of stuff in between
[00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:04.840]   that you should be practicing.
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:07.260]   If you honestly wanna maximize those three factors
[00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:08.780]   we talked about at the beginning,
[00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:11.060]   you need to be training across this full spectrum.
[00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:13.220]   Just like I told you to train across the full spectrum
[00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:14.060]   of your lifting,
[00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:15.920]   we wanna be doing the same thing here.
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:18.820]   So are there independent special factors
[00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:21.440]   that can happen with the shorter time length,
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:22.460]   higher intensity stuff?
[00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:23.460]   Absolutely.
[00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:24.800]   There's also magic that happens
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.040]   on the other end of that spectrum.
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:28.180]   So it's very important that people
[00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:29.700]   don't just choose one side.
[00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:32.180]   Because what tends to happen is people either go with,
[00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:35.100]   oh, I'm gonna do 30 or 45 minutes of steady state stuff.
[00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:36.880]   That's it.
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.300]   Or I'm gonna do the opposite,
[00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:40.080]   which I'm gonna leave that stuff on the table,
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:42.660]   not do it 'cause I only wanna do high intensity intervals
[00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:44.060]   'cause I can get it done in five minutes.
[00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:46.500]   So there's magic on both sides of the equation.
[00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:48.140]   We wanna get into all of that.
[00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:50.620]   But just to answer your question directly,
[00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:53.620]   there's a whole bunch of things you can do
[00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:56.460]   in under one minute that are convenient to do.
[00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:59.360]   And there's a wonderful set of papers
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.200]   out of a couple laboratories in Canada
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:04.500]   that championed this idea that's called exercise snacks.
[00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.580]   So there's a series of studies that have been done here
[00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:07.780]   that are really interesting.
[00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:09.260]   And they've looked at a couple of things
[00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:10.160]   that are noteworthy.
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:14.140]   One of them is a 20-second bout of all-out work.
[00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:16.860]   And this is actually done in workers in an office.
[00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:19.240]   And so what they had them do is run upstairs.
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:22.820]   And I believe it was about 60 steps is what it took them.
[00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:25.120]   Something along the order of 20 seconds exactly.
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:28.820]   And they repeated that about once every four hours.
[00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:30.100]   So really it's you go to work,
[00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:32.740]   you put your coffee in your bag down or whatever,
[00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:34.820]   you run up a flight of stairs 20 seconds later,
[00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:36.500]   then you go right back to work at lunch.
[00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:38.720]   And before you go home, you sort of repeat it there.
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:39.760]   And if you repeat that,
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:41.860]   that's multiple times a week you're gonna do that.
[00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:43.800]   I think they, in one of the interventions,
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.420]   it was three times a week for six weeks.
[00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:49.360]   18 total times you did that.
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:52.360]   And what you'll see is a noticeable improvement,
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:53.680]   and this is statistically significant,
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:55.540]   improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness,
[00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:57.260]   specifically VO2 max,
[00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.640]   as well as a number of cognitive benefits,
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:01.380]   work productivity, et cetera.
[00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:04.000]   That can happen in as little as 20 seconds.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.400]   You don't have to go to the gym, you don't have to shower,
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:07.920]   you don't have to do anything like that.
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:11.060]   Just find the stairs, run up and down them a few times.
[00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:12.580]   Now you may have noticed,
[00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:15.100]   you actually sort of caught me yesterday.
[00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:16.060]   I did that right here, right?
[00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:18.480]   I was just, we had a little bit of a break,
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:20.820]   I was feeling an energy lull.
[00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:24.160]   I ran up the stairs three or four times, felt a lot better.
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:26.180]   So that can actually also help.
[00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:28.400]   They ran another study where they looked at that
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:31.940]   following a giant high glycemic index meal.
[00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:34.380]   And what they saw, and then they took insulin measures
[00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:38.920]   and a whole bunch of other biological markers associated
[00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:40.340]   that you want to pay attention to
[00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:42.020]   with the high glycemic index meal.
[00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:43.740]   And they looked at those immediately,
[00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:46.020]   an hour, three hours, six hours, as opposed.
[00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:48.380]   And it was very clear that same intervention
[00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:51.700]   was able to improve post-planed yolk, glucose control,
[00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:54.560]   insulin, and a whole bunch of other factors
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:55.400]   in addition to that.
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:58.100]   So if you are the sort of type who's like, wow,
[00:10:58.100 --> 00:10:59.620]   I'm in an office all day,
[00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:03.140]   maybe also had a giant high glycemic index meal,
[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:06.940]   not the best approach, but a little bit of mitigation there
[00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:09.080]   can just be running up a flight of stairs
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:11.580]   or doing something like that for as little as 20 seconds.
[00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:16.000]   So there's a lot of magic and power and maximal exertion.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.060]   - If one does not have access to a flight of stairs at work,
[00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:21.960]   could they do jumping jacks?
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:22.860]   - Absolutely.
[00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:25.100]   I mean, you could do anything you really wanted.
[00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:28.420]   It's not the mode of exercise that matters here.
[00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:30.460]   It is simply the exertion.
[00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:32.480]   You just get up as hard as you can.
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:35.420]   You could do burpees, you could do any number of things.
[00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:37.220]   You could sprint down your road,
[00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:38.880]   down the hallway back and forth.
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:43.900]   The mode is just something that was easy
[00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:46.220]   for the scientists to control.
[00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:48.420]   And X number of steps, people could do it.
[00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:50.740]   You're not going to fall, hurt yourself, things like that.
[00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:53.920]   - Just to remind me, it's once every four hours,
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:55.540]   one minute of all out.
[00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:56.380]   - 20 seconds.
[00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:57.700]   - Oh, 20 seconds, excuse me.
[00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:00.860]   20 seconds of essentially all out exertion
[00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:03.380]   while remaining safe, not going so fast up the stairs
[00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:04.400]   or doing jumping jacks so fast.
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:07.400]   - And certainly not down the stairs, up the stairs please.
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:10.280]   - Escalators don't count.
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:12.620]   Well, I suppose they count if they're,
[00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:16.920]   if you're moving, if you're not remaining on the same steps.
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:18.920]   In fact, in an airport recently,
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:23.280]   I saw somebody walking against the conveyor
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:24.440]   while talking on the phone
[00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:25.960]   while waiting for their flight to take off.
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:27.280]   And I thought it's genius, right?
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:28.640]   It looked a little awkward.
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:29.480]   - Who cares?
[00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:30.320]   - Yeah, but it was-
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:32.300]   - I have looked awkward in every airport I've been in
[00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:34.700]   for the last 15 years, for those exact reasons,
[00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:36.360]   doing wild stuff like that.
[00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:37.520]   - Yeah, well, nothing's more awkward
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:39.920]   than not being able to walk to the end of the terminal
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:43.040]   simply because one isn't familiar with walking that far
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:44.420]   carrying a couple of suitcases.
[00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:45.260]   - There you go.
[00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:46.700]   - Yeah, that's the other fit test.
[00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:47.540]   - 100%.
[00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:49.900]   - The suitcase carrier in the airport.
[00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:50.740]   I love this.
[00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:52.060]   So once every four hours, 20 seconds.
[00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:54.540]   So maybe once when arriving to work,
[00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:57.240]   once four hours in and then four hours,
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:59.360]   and most people are probably at work somewhere,
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:00.920]   eight plus or minus two hours.
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:03.300]   - Now, one thing I actually really want to make clear
[00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:05.480]   because your audience is so incredible,
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:09.100]   they tend to be really excited about these protocols
[00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:11.300]   and they follow them exactly as written.
[00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:13.100]   That's not exactly how science works.
[00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:16.260]   So it doesn't necessarily have to be every four hours.
[00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:17.620]   It doesn't have to be three times a day.
[00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:19.620]   It doesn't have to be 20 seconds.
[00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:21.220]   They literally built that protocol
[00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:24.380]   because they're trying to replicate a real life scenario.
[00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:25.940]   Maybe you're in an office building,
[00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:27.300]   you're generally there for eight hours.
[00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:29.740]   Let's see if you did one every sort of,
[00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:31.540]   so if you want to do it four times a week, great.
[00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:33.820]   If you can do it only 10 seconds, amazing.
[00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:35.620]   You're probably going to get the same benefits.
[00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:37.580]   Those are not the details to pay attention to.
[00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:40.900]   The detail to pay attention to is every so often,
[00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:42.660]   multiple times a day,
[00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:44.680]   try to get your heart rate up really quickly.
[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:46.580]   Doesn't require sweating, doesn't require anything else.
[00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:48.940]   There's no warmup associated with it.
[00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:50.820]   Again, you need a minute break
[00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:52.940]   in between meetings or whatever, and you can sprint up them.
[00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:55.200]   I do this all the time in my house.
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:57.840]   When you have those days when you're on like seven straight
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:01.020]   hours of zooms, et cetera, you can get out of 20 seconds.
[00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:02.940]   I run to my garage, which is over there.
[00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:06.200]   I hop on the air bike and I will just smash out 30 seconds
[00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:08.860]   as fast as I can, and then walk right back in.
[00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:09.700]   - Love it.
[00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:10.740]   - Yeah.
[00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:12.140]   - I'm going to start.
[00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:14.420]   - Yeah, just also, you can just put one of those things,
[00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:17.240]   which I do also, just put one in your office
[00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:18.660]   and hop over out of there.
[00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:21.540]   The whole entire thing now literally takes 23 seconds.
[00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:23.180]   - Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize
[00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:25.060]   that this podcast is separate from my teaching
[00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:26.500]   and research roles at Stanford.
[00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:28.480]   It is also separate from Dr. Andy Galpin's
[00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:31.080]   teaching and research roles at Cal State Fullerton.
[00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:32.940]   It is, however, part of our desire and effort
[00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:35.320]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:37.820]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:38.900]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:41.500]   we'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:43.500]   Our first sponsor is Momentus.
[00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:46.820]   Momentus makes supplements of the absolute highest quality.
[00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:49.100]   The Huberman Lab podcast is proud to be partnering
[00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:51.420]   with Momentus for several important reasons.
[00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:52.560]   First of all, as I mentioned,
[00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:54.500]   their supplements are of extremely high quality.
[00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:57.260]   Second of all, their supplements are generally
[00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.320]   in single ingredient formulations.
[00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:01.740]   If you're going to develop a supplementation protocol,
[00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:03.200]   you're going to want to focus mainly
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:05.300]   on using single ingredient formulations.
[00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:07.080]   With single ingredient formulations,
[00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:09.380]   you can devise the most logical and effective
[00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:12.860]   and cost-effective supplementation regimen for your goals.
[00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:15.180]   In addition, Momentus supplements ship internationally.
[00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:17.140]   And this is, of course, important because we realized
[00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:19.140]   that many of the Huberman Lab podcast listeners
[00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:21.140]   reside outside the United States.
[00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:23.040]   If you'd like to try the various supplements mentioned
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:24.520]   on the Huberman Lab podcast,
[00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:26.920]   in particular supplements for hormone health,
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:29.040]   for sleep optimization, for focus,
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:30.220]   as well as a number of other things,
[00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:31.860]   including exercise recovery,
[00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:33.980]   you can go to Live Momentus, spelled O-U-S,
[00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:36.560]   so that's livemomentus.com/huberman.
[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:39.120]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Levels.
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.520]   Levels is a program that lets you see how different foods
[00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:43.220]   and activities affect your health
[00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:45.900]   by giving you real-time feedback on your blood glucose
[00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:47.980]   using a continuous glucose monitor.
[00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:50.120]   Many people are aware that their blood sugar,
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:51.820]   that is their blood glucose level,
[00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:55.100]   is critical for everything from fat loss,
[00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:57.540]   to muscle gain, to healthy cognition,
[00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:00.580]   and indeed, aging of the brain and body.
[00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:02.060]   Most people do not know, however,
[00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:04.480]   how different foods and different activities,
[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:07.960]   including exercise or different temperature environments,
[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:09.480]   impact their blood glucose levels.
[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:11.900]   And yet, blood glucose is exquisitely sensitive
[00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:13.440]   to all of those things.
[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:16.300]   I first started using Levels about a year ago
[00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:18.200]   as a way to understand how different foods,
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:21.160]   exercise, and timing of food relative to exercise,
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:22.740]   and quality of sleep at night
[00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:24.420]   impact my blood glucose levels.
[00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:27.780]   And I've learned a tremendous amount from using Levels.
[00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:30.900]   It's taught me when best to eat, what best to eat,
[00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:33.780]   when best to exercise, how best to exercise,
[00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:36.500]   and how to modulate my entire schedule
[00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:39.460]   from work to exercise and even my sleep.
[00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:41.220]   So if you're interested in learning more about Levels
[00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:43.840]   and trying a continuous glucose monitor yourself,
[00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:46.060]   go to levels.link/huberman.
[00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:48.640]   That's levels.link/huberman.
[00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:51.020]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Element.
[00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:52.420]   Element is an electrolyte drink
[00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:53.900]   that contains the exact ratios
[00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:56.660]   of the electrolytes sodium, magnesium, and potassium
[00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:58.140]   to optimize cellular functioning
[00:16:58.140 --> 00:16:59.900]   for mental and physical performance.
[00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:01.880]   Most people realize that hydration is key.
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:03.740]   We need to ingest enough fluids
[00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:06.240]   in order to feel our best and perform our best.
[00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:08.240]   But what most people do not realize
[00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:10.500]   is that the proper functioning of our cells
[00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:12.620]   and nerve cells, neurons in particular,
[00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:16.100]   requires that sodium, magnesium, and potassium be present
[00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:17.480]   in the correct ratios.
[00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:20.600]   Now, of course, people with prehypertension and hypertension
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:22.760]   need to be careful about their sodium intake.
[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:24.520]   But what a lot of people don't realize
[00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:27.360]   is that if you drink caffeine, if you exercise,
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:29.960]   and in particular, if you're following a very clean diet,
[00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:31.920]   that is not a lot of processed foods,
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:34.000]   which of course is a good thing,
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.900]   chances are you're not getting enough sodium, potassium,
[00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:39.680]   and magnesium to optimize mental and physical performance.
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:43.380]   Element contains a science-backed ratio of 1000 milligrams,
[00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:46.320]   that's one gram of sodium, 200 milligrams of potassium,
[00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:49.440]   and 60 milligrams of magnesium and no sugar.
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:50.560]   If you'd like to try Element,
[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:54.500]   you can go to Drink Element, that's lmnt.com/huberman,
[00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:56.640]   to get a free Element sample pack with your purchase.
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:00.460]   Again, that's Drink Element, lmnt.com/huberman,
[00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:02.160]   to claim a free sample pack.
[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:03.520]   So tell me about endurance.
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:04.880]   What is endurance?
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:07.060]   How do I get more endurance?
[00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:09.100]   And how does it work?
[00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:10.200]   - When we think about endurance,
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:11.840]   I would like to open up the conversation
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:14.720]   to include more things than people generally do
[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:16.240]   when they hear the word endurance.
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:17.840]   So if we just think about
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:20.520]   what you typically ask your body to do,
[00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:22.680]   or would like to ask your body to do,
[00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:24.680]   and we just walk through them,
[00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:25.760]   it's gonna be things like this.
[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:28.200]   Number one, I wanna have energy throughout the day.
[00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:30.460]   That's actually a form of endurance.
[00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:32.680]   Great, I don't wanna have these lulls and fatigue,
[00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:33.960]   and I wanna feel fantastic
[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:36.200]   as I move throughout my activities of daily living,
[00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:37.320]   whatever those may be.
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:42.320]   Work, exercise, enjoyment, paying attention, focus,
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:44.880]   all that stuff, great, that's one thing.
[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.920]   Another thing you wanna ask your body to do
[00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:50.720]   is I wanna be able to repeat some small effort
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:53.080]   in a muscle group and feel great about that.
[00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:55.180]   This is what we generally call muscular endurance.
[00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:56.440]   So this is something like,
[00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:58.960]   I wanna be able to walk up those 10 flights of steps
[00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:01.940]   and my quads aren't burning at the end of it, right?
[00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:04.100]   Or it even gives me energy.
[00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:06.320]   Another thing you'll wanna ask your body to do
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:09.080]   is to be able to perform a tremendous amount of work
[00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:11.380]   for a longer period of time,
[00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:14.400]   something in the realm of 20 to 80 seconds.
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:17.120]   So this could be something like if you're surfing
[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:19.440]   and you've gotta paddle extremely hard for a minute
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:20.760]   to get on top of a wave,
[00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:23.360]   or you're out riding your bike
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:24.560]   and you need to be able to get up a hill
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:26.080]   and it's a very steep hill.
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:28.640]   These are gonna take maximal effort
[00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:30.360]   for some small amount of time
[00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:31.320]   and then you'll get back up there.
[00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:33.960]   We tend to call that maximum anaerobic capacity,
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:36.280]   so that the max amount of work you can perform
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:39.600]   at a high rate for some amount of seconds,
[00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:41.380]   like maybe a minute.
[00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:44.480]   Past that is your ability to repeat an effort
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:48.020]   kind of like that for something like five to 15 minutes.
[00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:50.920]   And this is the example would be run a mile, right?
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:54.340]   Some interval like that which is a longer distance, right?
[00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:57.120]   That is gonna be your maximum aerobic capacity.
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:00.180]   Another thing you're gonna want your body to do
[00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:02.300]   is what we call sustained position.
[00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:05.500]   So this is you wanna be able to sit in your chair at work
[00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:09.440]   and have perfect posture for 20, 30, 40 minutes, right?
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:11.640]   You wanna be able to stand in line at a grocery store
[00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:13.880]   for 15 minutes and not have a breakdown in posture.
[00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:15.720]   So you wanna be able to maintain position
[00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.580]   when you're riding your bike, you're not collapsing,
[00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:19.520]   you're doing any of these activities
[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:22.760]   and you don't get hurt or lose efficiency
[00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:26.480]   simply because you couldn't sustain basic positions, right?
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:29.300]   Whatever those shapes and positions seem to be.
[00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:32.460]   And then the last one is a maximum distance.
[00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:35.360]   So you wanna be able to go for a longer hike
[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:37.060]   or have just a long day at Disneyland
[00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:40.740]   for whatever it needs to be and feel great at the end of it.
[00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:42.580]   So the goal with all of these things
[00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:45.240]   is not can you just do them, but can you do them
[00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:47.460]   and then you feel good afterwards.
[00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:48.900]   So we're back in a right position
[00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:51.560]   where they give you energy, you feel good about it
[00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:53.360]   and it's not just something you had to do
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:54.860]   and you regretted and you felt awful.
[00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:57.700]   So those are the factors I think about
[00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:59.300]   when someone says I want better endurance
[00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:00.760]   is I wanna walk backwards and say,
[00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:02.380]   okay, when you say endurance, what do you mean?
[00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:04.440]   And that's generally the things I've come across
[00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:07.160]   is if you can handle all of those things,
[00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:09.600]   you're gonna feel like you're in fantastic shape.
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:12.520]   You're gonna feel your recovery is going to be excellent
[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:14.400]   and your physical performance in the gym
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:16.160]   or in any of the sporting activities you do
[00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:17.480]   will be enhanced.
[00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:19.480]   - Given what you told us a little bit earlier,
[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:23.280]   that endurance really reflects fatigue management
[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:28.260]   and energy production, how do each and both of those things
[00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:31.080]   relate to endurance at a mechanistic level?
[00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:31.920]   - Sure.
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:34.120]   - And really what I'm asking is what is fatigue management
[00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:36.040]   and what is energy production?
[00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:38.400]   - In order to do that, it's important that we understand
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:40.600]   all of those functional capacities
[00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:42.240]   that I just talked about.
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:44.640]   They all have different points of failure.
[00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:48.240]   So in order to then work backwards and say,
[00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:50.360]   well, how do I optimize my performance
[00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:51.500]   in all those categories?
[00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:53.140]   We need to go through each one and figure out,
[00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:54.300]   well, where am I failing?
[00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:55.920]   Some of them are gonna be failing
[00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:57.360]   because of fatigue management
[00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:58.640]   and some of them will be failing
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:00.400]   because of energy production issues.
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:03.460]   So if we walk through a little bit of how we make energy
[00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:05.640]   and how we handle fatigue,
[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:06.740]   then we're gonna have a better understanding
[00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:09.720]   of exactly what to do for each one of these categories
[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:11.400]   if you feel like one of them in particular
[00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:13.920]   is worse for you or lagging behind,
[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:16.840]   or if in general you just wanna improve all of them.
[00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:17.940]   All right, now I wanna make a little bit
[00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:19.880]   of a 90 degree turn here.
[00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:21.520]   I'm gonna do it with strategy though, I promise.
[00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:24.360]   And I wanna ask you a very simple question.
[00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:25.620]   How do you lose weight?
[00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:31.840]   - I was taught that the calories in, calories out,
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:34.860]   thermodynamics of energy utilization
[00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:36.420]   governs most everything.
[00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:41.160]   That is, if I'm ingesting less caloric energy than I burn,
[00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.380]   then I'm going to lose weight.
[00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:46.280]   And if I'm ingesting exactly as much as I burn,
[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:47.120]   I'll maintain weight.
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:51.320]   And if I ingest more than I burn, then I'll gain weight.
[00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:54.600]   - Sure, that is the approach you would take.
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:56.180]   What I'm asking really is,
[00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:59.420]   how are you actually physically losing the weight?
[00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:01.160]   - So my understanding is that we have
[00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:03.360]   different fuel sources in the body.
[00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:06.960]   Glycogen, which is stored in muscle and liver.
[00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:10.920]   Body fat, which is stored in mainly white adipose tissue,
[00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:14.000]   and which is subcutaneous and around our organs,
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.540]   intra-visceral fat.
[00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:18.460]   And that we can also use protein as a fuel.
[00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:20.040]   And then as I recall,
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:23.160]   there's also a phosphocreatine system.
[00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:24.960]   And I think you're going to tell me
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:28.060]   that each of these systems is tapped into
[00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:29.760]   on different timescales.
[00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:33.000]   And perhaps according to different levels of exertion.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.740]   And I'm certain that what I just said is not exhaustive,
[00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:42.160]   but hopefully it is most or entirely correct.
[00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:43.240]   - Pretty correct.
[00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:45.800]   What's that got to do with fat loss?
[00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:50.800]   - At some point, body fat stores, adipocytes, fat cells,
[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:55.040]   are going to start liberating fat as a fuel source.
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:58.080]   And the stimulus for that, I'm assuming,
[00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:01.760]   is going to be that other fuel sources are either depleted
[00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:05.300]   or that the energy and metabolic systems of the body,
[00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:07.560]   I don't want to say decide,
[00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:09.000]   because they don't have their own consciousness,
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.640]   but are-- - Signaled?
[00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:15.840]   - Are signaling in a way that registers that body fat
[00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:18.200]   would be the optimal fuel source,
[00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:23.020]   given how long and/or intensely a given activity
[00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:25.460]   has been performed.
[00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:27.280]   - Okay, we have some stuff to clean up there,
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:30.460]   but we're still not really answering the question.
[00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:32.800]   How am I actually losing that body fat?
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:34.340]   - How is it actually leaving the body?
[00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:35.180]   - Correct.
[00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:37.520]   - My understanding is that it leaves the body
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:38.720]   through respiration.
[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:39.660]   - Aha.
[00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:43.160]   So now we have some interesting things to talk about.
[00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:46.180]   How am I actually losing fat via respiration?
[00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:47.720]   What the hell does that even mean?
[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:50.760]   How is something that occupied this physical space
[00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:54.320]   on the side of me, leaving my body through my mouth?
[00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:55.840]   And that is a very clear answer there, right?
[00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:57.920]   Which I'm sure you're cued up to.
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:59.420]   When you take a breath in,
[00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:01.920]   you're generally breathing in oxygen, O2.
[00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:04.000]   There's some other things, but we'll just stick to oxygen.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.220]   When you exhale, you're breathing out CO2.
[00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:10.140]   The difference between those two is that carbon molecule.
[00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:12.000]   Well, one of the things that's important to understand here
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.940]   is all of your carbohydrates,
[00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:17.760]   which is, that word itself is a carbon
[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:18.720]   that has been hydrated.
[00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:21.540]   So it is a carbon molecule attached to a water molecule.
[00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:23.460]   It is a simple chain of carbons.
[00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:26.640]   Your fat molecules are also chains of carbon.
[00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:30.360]   All of metabolism really, in terms of energy production,
[00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:32.600]   is simply trying to figure out a way
[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:35.000]   to break those carbon bonds.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.520]   As a result, we get energy from that.
[00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:38.960]   We use that energy to create a molecule called ATP,
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:42.220]   which is the central source of energy for any living being.
[00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:46.340]   That carbon is then floating around in free form,
[00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:49.200]   which is bad news internally.
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:50.380]   So we've got to figure out a way
[00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:52.520]   to get that carbon out of our system.
[00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:55.280]   So all of energy production, all of fatigue management,
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:56.940]   really comes down to this core issue
[00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:59.200]   of how are we handling carbon?
[00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:01.220]   And how are we moving it around the body?
[00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:03.280]   And so what we do is we do this sneaky thing.
[00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:04.780]   So another question I like to ask people is,
[00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:05.880]   why do we breathe?
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:10.580]   - Well, for two reasons.
[00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:12.180]   To bring oxygen into the system
[00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:13.720]   and to offload carbon dioxide,
[00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:16.660]   but the neural trigger for breathing
[00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:19.820]   is when carbon dioxide hits a threshold level
[00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:22.180]   in the set of neurons in the brainstem
[00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:25.660]   and elsewhere activate the phrenic nerve
[00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:27.660]   or the gas reflex or a combination of things
[00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:30.320]   and we inhale or inhale.
[00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:32.740]   - Right, so a reduction of oxygen intake
[00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:34.500]   generally doesn't stimulate ventilation
[00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:35.940]   unless you're at altitude.
[00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:37.300]   Then that sort of changes, right?
[00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:39.620]   In general, it's an elevation in CO2
[00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:41.460]   that's going to stimulate breathing out.
[00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:44.920]   The only reason you bring in O2 for the most part
[00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:47.380]   is to get rid of the CO2.
[00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:49.700]   Oxygen is not a fuel source.
[00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:52.780]   It works the same with fire, by the way.
[00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:56.020]   So you know you have to have oxygen present for a fire to go
[00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:58.020]   and if you squelch oxygen, the fire will go out, right?
[00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:03.020]   That's sort of half of how those fire extinguishers work.
[00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:06.280]   But we think then that means oxygen is the fuel.
[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:07.460]   It is not the fuel.
[00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:08.640]   It is something entirely different.
[00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:11.880]   It is a product that is necessary
[00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:14.740]   for the metabolism process to actually occur.
[00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:17.480]   All right, so we're kind of dancing around an idea here,
[00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:20.500]   which is this carbon cycle of life.
[00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:23.220]   So what happens in plants
[00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:25.880]   is they generally will breathe in the opposite
[00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:27.280]   and breathe out the opposite of humans.
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:31.040]   So a plant will breathe in CO2 and exhale O2, right?
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:33.180]   This is why we have to have a certain amount of these things
[00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:35.720]   and algae and forests and trees and stuff
[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:39.220]   to maintain this O2 CO2 balance in our atmosphere.
[00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:40.140]   We do the opposite.
[00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:41.840]   And so we have this wonderful circle of life.
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:45.620]   We breathe in O2, breathe out CO2, they do the opposite.
[00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:48.380]   Well, what happens is because carbohydrates
[00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:51.380]   are long chains of carbon and fats are as well.
[00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:53.540]   Generally, when we think about fats, by the way,
[00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:55.840]   it's important to understand that structure a little bit.
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:58.120]   So if we think about triglycerides,
[00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:01.260]   it is a three carbon backbone chain of glycerol.
[00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:02.580]   So it's one, two, three.
[00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:06.120]   And horizontally running off of each one of those
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:07.700]   are fatty acid chains, right?
[00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:10.140]   And so we form this structure that looks like an E, right?
[00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:11.900]   Like the letter E, three in the back
[00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:13.760]   and then three chains coming off of it.
[00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:15.860]   Each of those chains are called fatty acids
[00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:19.240]   and each of those fatty acids are a length of carbon, right?
[00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:21.320]   Or a number of carbons strung together.
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:23.400]   However many carbons are there determines
[00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:24.960]   which type of fatty acid it is, right?
[00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:26.480]   So steric acid, linoleic acid,
[00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:28.280]   like any different number of things.
[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:29.740]   It's also what determines whether or not
[00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:32.280]   is a monounsaturated or polyunsaturated
[00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:35.920]   is if carbon requires a special thing called a double bond.
[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:38.500]   So if there's a double bond across every carbon to carbon,
[00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:40.600]   then they're all fully saturated and you're great.
[00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:43.220]   If there's any of them that are not double bonded,
[00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:44.340]   I mean, in fact, an example,
[00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:46.400]   if there is one that doesn't have a double bond,
[00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:48.540]   that is now called monounsaturated.
[00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:51.340]   And if there are many, it is called polyunsaturated.
[00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:53.720]   So there's pros and cons to all of these things, right?
[00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:56.980]   In either case, we're still talking long carbon chains.
[00:28:56.980 --> 00:29:01.100]   So what a plant will do is bring in carbon
[00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:03.440]   and then it has this wonderful ability to use energy
[00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:05.520]   from the sun called photosynthesis.
[00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:08.640]   And it can take those carbons that it inhales
[00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:11.700]   and use the energy from the sun to form a bond.
[00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:14.560]   Now, in our prior discussion, when we were going over
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:16.220]   hypertrophy, we talked about the energy
[00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:18.620]   is required to go through protein synthesis.
[00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:21.940]   That's because forming a new atom or a new bond
[00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:23.780]   between atoms oftentimes takes energy.
[00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:25.600]   In these cases, it does.
[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:26.740]   The same thing happens here.
[00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:29.000]   So if a plant does not have oxygen
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.020]   or does not have carbon dioxide in the air, it has no fuel.
[00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:34.500]   They basically think about it as that's what it eats.
[00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:37.060]   It needs to get nitrogen from the ground and the soil.
[00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:39.280]   Just like we need to get nitrogen from our protein,
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:41.520]   but fuel wise, it needs to get carbon dioxide.
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:43.760]   Then it needs sun to give it energy
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:46.020]   so that it can actually form that bond.
[00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:47.920]   That's what it's getting its fuel from.
[00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:53.380]   So if we think about a classic plant
[00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:58.060]   that produces either a starch or a fruit,
[00:29:58.060 --> 00:29:59.900]   here's what happens.
[00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:03.360]   It inhales that carbon and then it starts packing it away.
[00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:05.500]   Now, in a root vegetable, what it does
[00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:07.040]   is it stores those things together.
[00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:08.700]   And if we store that thing and we grow fruit
[00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:11.640]   at the bottom of it, we tend to call those things starches.
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:14.380]   It's going to then take the carbon
[00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:18.360]   that is packed away in its root and send it up the tree.
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:20.240]   And it's gonna actually do that by breaking it down
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:22.480]   into a smaller form of carbohydrate
[00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:26.640]   that we tend to often call things like sucrose and glucose.
[00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:28.020]   It'll ship that up the tree.
[00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:29.200]   It'll go out to the leaves
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:30.600]   and it'll convert it into the fruit.
[00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:32.920]   And it's gonna eventually transform that stuff
[00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:35.720]   into smaller carbon things called fructose.
[00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:39.080]   And if we think about the fruit or the sugar in fruit,
[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:42.020]   it's often in the form of fructose or sucrose
[00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:44.120]   or a combination and sometimes glucose.
[00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:47.100]   So we have these smaller carbon, six carbon chains
[00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:49.340]   generally in the form of glucose
[00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:53.200]   that are being made from this larger storage
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:58.200]   of carbohydrates that we call starch, right?
[00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:00.860]   So it's packed in together.
[00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:03.820]   Your body does the exact same thing.
[00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:07.840]   So if it's a potato and it has a whole bunch
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:10.900]   of glucose packed away, we call that starch.
[00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:12.720]   If it's in your quadricep
[00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:15.940]   and we pack about a whole bunch of glucose away,
[00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:17.760]   we now call it glycogen.
[00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:21.200]   If it's in your blood as that six carbon chain,
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:22.480]   we call it glucose.
[00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:25.720]   If it's in the tree and in the fruit, we call it fructose.
[00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:26.560]   Those are different molecules,
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:28.240]   but that's effectively the same thing happens.
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:31.840]   So the biology or the chemistry is almost identical.
[00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:33.720]   It just runs in the reverse order.
[00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:36.700]   And that's why again, tubers and potatoes and stuff
[00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:39.620]   tend to be starches and fruits tend to be glucose,
[00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:40.920]   fructose and sucrose.
[00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:44.680]   So we have this wonderful circle of light.
[00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:48.820]   The plants can survive on just breathing in the CO2
[00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:50.080]   and then getting the energy from the sun.
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:52.840]   We don't have that ability, at least to my knowledge,
[00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:54.240]   to run through photosynthesis.
[00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:57.640]   So the only way we can get carbon into our system
[00:31:57.640 --> 00:31:59.880]   is to actually ingest carbon,
[00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:03.840]   which means we have to eat the starch, the fruit,
[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:07.320]   the animal, some other form of stored carbon
[00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:09.160]   to get that into our system.
[00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:10.500]   We then pack that away.
[00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:12.560]   We put the carbohydrates, as you mentioned earlier,
[00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:16.760]   either in our liver, our blood or in our muscles.
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:18.920]   We put the fat generally in adipose tissue.
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:20.680]   We'll put a little bit in muscle cells
[00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:22.680]   as intramuscular triglycerides.
[00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:26.120]   And then the protein we'll use as structure, right?
[00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:26.940]   To do different things.
[00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:29.640]   We don't like to use protein as material or fuel.
[00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:31.680]   It's better to use as structure.
[00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:33.680]   And what we have to do then is if all of a sudden
[00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:36.920]   we realize that storage is getting too much in our body,
[00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:38.840]   in other words, we're gaining too much weight,
[00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:40.720]   we have to figure out how to get the carbons
[00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:42.320]   out of our body.
[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:44.960]   And that is metabolism, right?
[00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:47.480]   Anytime we're trying to break a carbon bonds
[00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:49.600]   that we can get energy to make ATP,
[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:52.640]   that's gonna release the carbon out of our tissue
[00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:53.480]   into the blood.
[00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:56.720]   We have to bring in oxygen to bind that carbon molecule
[00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:58.600]   to make CO2 so we can exhale it
[00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:00.760]   and put it back into the atmosphere.
[00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:03.840]   - That's a beautiful description of the circle of life
[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:08.840]   and energy utilization in the human body.
[00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:10.680]   I have to ask the question that I'm sure
[00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:12.440]   many people are wondering about,
[00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:16.340]   which is if indeed we exhale these carbons
[00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:19.000]   and as it relates to fat loss,
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.280]   that is the way that we lose fat
[00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:23.640]   if we're in a sub-caloric state, for instance.
[00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:29.220]   Has it ever been explored as to whether increasing
[00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:31.560]   the duration or intensity of exhales
[00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:32.940]   can accelerate fat loss?
[00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:34.360]   I mean, that's sort of the logical extension
[00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:35.460]   of what you described.
[00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:38.560]   And here, I'm actually interested equally
[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:41.380]   in whether or not the answer is yes,
[00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:45.060]   as well as whether it could be no.
[00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:48.020]   Because I could imagine if the answer is yes,
[00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:49.460]   well, then there's some interesting protocols
[00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:51.540]   to emerge from that, but that if it's no,
[00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:53.860]   it will reveal to us some important bottlenecks
[00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:56.360]   about metabolism and energy utilization.
[00:33:56.360 --> 00:34:00.860]   - You ever seen those magicians who show up
[00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:04.700]   and they can tell your mom's name
[00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:06.020]   or something like that before you,
[00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:08.500]   'cause they can sort of lead you down a path?
[00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:10.540]   - Yeah, I mean, not to take us down a deep dive tangent,
[00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:13.660]   but I once went to the Magic Castle in Los Angeles
[00:34:13.660 --> 00:34:16.080]   and I was one of the people called up front
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:20.200]   and an incredible magician named,
[00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:22.940]   I think his name was Ozzy Mind or something,
[00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:24.780]   I think that's right, had me write my name
[00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:27.800]   on a card in a Sharpie pen.
[00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:30.860]   I ripped up the card, I ripped it up,
[00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:32.420]   I put it in my pocket.
[00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:36.620]   And at the end of the 10 or 15 minute bout
[00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:38.700]   of him doing a bunch of other tricks,
[00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:41.220]   he asked me to look in my right shoe
[00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:46.220]   and under my foot in my right shoe was that card intact.
[00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:48.820]   And it was no longer in my pocket.
[00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:52.520]   And I swear on my life, I wasn't a collaborator with him.
[00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:55.340]   And to this day, it still gives me chills
[00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:58.780]   because I don't know how, magic.
[00:34:58.780 --> 00:34:59.940]   - Yeah, right, magic.
[00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:02.860]   Well, the reason I say that is I've given that little spiel
[00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:05.560]   that I just gave you countless times in my classes.
[00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:08.820]   And I would say 99% of the time, as soon as I stop,
[00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:11.100]   the very first question is,
[00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:15.780]   so can I just like do a bunch of exhales and lose fat?
[00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:17.700]   Which is wonderful 'cause I was really hoping
[00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:20.300]   you would do that and you rolled right into my trap.
[00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:24.360]   You landed perfectly, so I look like a magician over here.
[00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:27.280]   - I feel like I should look in my right shoe right now.
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:30.120]   No, I asked the question because it's the logical extension
[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:33.280]   of what you laid out, but I know biology
[00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:37.360]   to be both diabolical and cryptic,
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:41.120]   but also exquisite in the way that things are arranged
[00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:43.320]   and you don't get something for nothing.
[00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:45.600]   - There are no free passes in physiology.
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:48.000]   That's the saying, no free passes.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.120]   The answer to your question is yes.
[00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:51.320]   - A lot, 100% yes.
[00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:54.800]   In fact, that is the only way to go about it.
[00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:56.180]   You have two options.
[00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:59.080]   You can ingest less carbon or you can expel more carbon.
[00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:00.640]   People always say calories in, calories out.
[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:02.720]   It's really carbon in, carbon out.
[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:03.920]   That's what a calorie is, right?
[00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:05.480]   Calorie is the amount of energy we get
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:07.800]   per breaking carbon bond.
[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:10.560]   So it's really less in, more out.
[00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:13.420]   Less in is fairly obvious, whether that comes in any form.
[00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:17.120]   And by the way, this is exactly why the percentage
[00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:19.800]   of your intake coming from fats or carbohydrate,
[00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:21.560]   it doesn't really matter that much.
[00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:24.880]   If you look at fat loss clinical trials,
[00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:27.100]   you guys may have covered this when Lane was in here.
[00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:29.520]   I'm sure like this is something he talks about a lot.
[00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:30.360]   It doesn't matter.
[00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:33.560]   It's irrelevant because it's not about that.
[00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:35.280]   There's nothing magic in those things.
[00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:36.120]   They are different.
[00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:38.000]   They have different physiological responses.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:39.160]   Everything is different, right?
[00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:40.160]   No doubt.
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:42.760]   But in general, it's just simply about carbon intake.
[00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:46.840]   Turns out fat has a lot more carbons per mole
[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:48.160]   than carbohydrates do.
[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:50.880]   So there's more calories per mole in there.
[00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:53.120]   So if you, the physical amount of fat
[00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:54.680]   needs to come in as a smaller amount,
[00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:56.680]   physical amount of carbohydrates needs to come in,
[00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:57.700]   will come in as a larger amount.
[00:36:57.700 --> 00:37:02.540]   But you can play any number of very high carb, low fat,
[00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:04.440]   what matters, total calories, right?
[00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:06.760]   Again, it's not like the only thing that matters,
[00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:07.880]   but you know what I'm saying?
[00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:10.000]   Some percentages in the way can go.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.920]   Fat loss works fantastic.
[00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:13.960]   High fat, low carbohydrate, why?
[00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:15.880]   Why do all these things work?
[00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:17.240]   Because it's not about that.
[00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:21.160]   It's about total intake of carbon, total exhalation.
[00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:25.360]   So absolutely can you lose fat by simply exhaling more?
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:28.400]   In fact, that is exactly what you did this morning.
[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:29.800]   - When I hopped on the Airdyne bike for-
[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:32.100]   - When you did anything, right?
[00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:34.160]   The question is, can you think of a scenario
[00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:37.560]   in which you could have a bunch of increased rates
[00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:40.880]   of exhalation that helps in fat loss?
[00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:42.080]   - Sure, I can think of a lot of things
[00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:45.160]   that will stimulate increased rates of exhalation.
[00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:49.500]   One thing could be simply going. (breathing heavily)
[00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:50.340]   Right, and so the question is like,
[00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:52.000]   can I literally do some breath protocols
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   where I force exhale and lose fat?
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.120]   And the answer is yes.
[00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:58.240]   But what happens?
[00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:01.200]   What happens if you do hyperventilation training?
[00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:04.280]   - Well, my lab studies cyclic hyperventilation
[00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:06.780]   as one of our many deliberate protocols.
[00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:10.000]   And one of the most prominent things that one observes
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.440]   is that levels of adrenaline increase very quickly.
[00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:15.280]   - Extremely quickly.
[00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:17.300]   - People feel jittery, anxious, stressed.
[00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:20.480]   And unless they are consciously trying to anchor
[00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:22.480]   their thinking about what that means
[00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:25.080]   and the benefits set to persisting,
[00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:28.200]   typically they abort the cyclic hyperventilation protocol
[00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:29.040]   really quickly.
[00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:30.320]   - Within seconds, right?
[00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:32.600]   You will feel tingling, sweating, all kinds of things.
[00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:33.840]   You're hyperventilating, right?
[00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:37.540]   And we could talk in nauseum about how that changes
[00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:39.160]   everything from adrenaline to focus,
[00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:40.320]   to a whole bunch of things.
[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:43.840]   So unfortunately, a strategy of sitting around,
[00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:45.640]   just exhaling more than you inhale,
[00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:49.300]   technically helps you lose more fat,
[00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:50.980]   but it's not going to last very long.
[00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:53.420]   So then the question is, well, how do I get into a situation
[00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:57.360]   or a scenario in which I can increase my rate of expiration
[00:38:57.360 --> 00:38:58.640]   where I'm not gonna pass out?
[00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:02.240]   I'm not going and altering hypocapnia and hypercapnia issues.
[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:04.760]   Any idea of a situation in which you would have
[00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:06.580]   an enhanced rate of exclamation
[00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:08.880]   without worrying about passing out?
[00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:11.380]   - Sure, steady state exercise.
[00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:14.340]   Or not steady state exercise, lifting weights,
[00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:17.060]   intervals, moderate training, repeated.
[00:39:17.060 --> 00:39:21.180]   Any of these things, they all work equally for fat loss
[00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:23.860]   because all they're doing is increasing respiration rate.
[00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:26.620]   They're saying increased demand for energy,
[00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:29.840]   increased exhalation.
[00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:31.300]   That's the trick here.
[00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:33.140]   And when you equate these things to that,
[00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:35.920]   they have equal success in fat loss.
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:38.040]   It doesn't matter theoretically
[00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:40.800]   where you're getting it from.
[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:42.740]   And so when we get into this idea of,
[00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:46.220]   well, what are the best training strategies for fat loss,
[00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:51.060]   it doesn't matter which one of these tactics you pick
[00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:54.020]   as long as you maintain a consistent adherence over time
[00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:56.700]   because of this exact fact.
[00:39:56.700 --> 00:39:59.940]   It doesn't matter if you're burning quote unquote fat
[00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:01.620]   in the exercise session,
[00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:04.920]   or if you're burning carbohydrates in the exercise session.
[00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:09.920]   It is totally irrelevant to your net fat loss over time.
[00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:13.220]   Hey, now there's some significant misconceptions there
[00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:15.820]   about what I just talked and I would love to come back
[00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:17.580]   and walk through that in more detail,
[00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:20.600]   but that's the main take home message here.
[00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:22.080]   It won't matter what's coming in
[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:23.380]   and it won't matter what's coming out
[00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:27.320]   because in either case it is the same rate of oxygen in
[00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:29.040]   and CO2 out.
[00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:30.720]   That's the key metric.
[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:34.320]   And hopefully this helps a lot of people have some relief
[00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:36.140]   because they're like, man, you're so tied up
[00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:38.160]   on what is the exact protocol for training
[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:39.620]   for optimizing fat loss.
[00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:41.840]   What's the exact nutritional intervention I need
[00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:42.680]   for fat loss?
[00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:44.980]   And then you wonder why all these different diets
[00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:46.580]   can work effectively.
[00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:48.460]   And wonder why all these different training protocols,
[00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:51.460]   and surely you know somebody who lost a bunch of weight
[00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:54.200]   and the only thing they did is they just started running.
[00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:55.980]   There was no advanced protocol, they just started running
[00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:58.100]   and they ran five miles every day.
[00:40:58.100 --> 00:40:58.940]   That works.
[00:40:58.940 --> 00:41:00.100]   And then tons of people who tried that
[00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:01.500]   and didn't lose anything.
[00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:03.060]   And lots of people who went to,
[00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:05.860]   I went to cardio kickboxing class, lost weight.
[00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:08.920]   Oh, I just started doing intervals on my, why?
[00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:11.220]   Mysteriously you do all these things work.
[00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:13.540]   There have, something has, some spidey sense
[00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:15.020]   has to be going off in your brain.
[00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:18.060]   We're like, there has to be something linking these things.
[00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:21.960]   And what's linking it is simply carbon exchange.
[00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:24.640]   So put yourself in a position in which you are exhaling
[00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:27.860]   more than you and inhaling without passing out.
[00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:29.700]   The other problem is if you were to simply do
[00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:33.320]   a breathing protocol while the rate of exhalation
[00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:35.460]   would go up, after that you would correct
[00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:36.820]   and go in the opposite direction.
[00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:38.320]   So that's the problem is your net carbon
[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:40.220]   and output over the course of the day is not going to change
[00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:43.540]   unless you increase the demand for energy.
[00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:46.660]   And that's how you get into that negative state.
[00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:50.140]   - Along these lines of exhaling carbons
[00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:52.220]   as the route for fat loss,
[00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:55.580]   it makes me wonder whether or not
[00:41:55.580 --> 00:41:58.260]   increasing lung capacity is possible.
[00:41:58.260 --> 00:41:59.620]   I'm guessing the answer is yes.
[00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:02.900]   And whether or not increasing lung capacity
[00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:07.220]   is a good goal and route to enhancing fat loss.
[00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:09.660]   Essentially what I'm asking is if you can offload
[00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:14.660]   more CO2 carbons per exhale,
[00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:18.380]   are you a more efficient fat loss machine?
[00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:21.240]   - It's a wonderful thought and the answer would be no.
[00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:22.360]   Not something you need to worry about
[00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:27.060]   because if you were to exhale more carbon
[00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:31.220]   than actually needed, now we're in a state of inefficiency.
[00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:33.280]   You're burning way more energy than needed
[00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:34.760]   to do your activity.
[00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:38.260]   The heart has a metric called cardiac output.
[00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:41.460]   This is in science, we abbreviate this as Q
[00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:43.980]   for some odd reasons, it's either CO or Q.
[00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:47.120]   And cardiac output is heart rate multiplied
[00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:47.960]   by stroke volume.
[00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:49.400]   So it's how many beats per minute you're having
[00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:50.940]   as well as how much blood's coming out of it.
[00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:55.940]   So cardiac output is actually very specific to energy needs.
[00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:57.720]   If you try to work around that,
[00:42:57.720 --> 00:42:58.960]   it's just going to adjust itself.
[00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:01.300]   So what I mean by this is if you were able
[00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:02.640]   to increase your stroke volumes,
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:03.920]   the amount of blood coming out per pump,
[00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:06.760]   you would automatically adjust to reduce your heart rate
[00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:11.680]   so that you keep cardiac output exact to energetic demands.
[00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:14.400]   So you're sort of pushing one end of the spectrum
[00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:15.880]   but your body will pull the other one back
[00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:18.200]   to keep you at that exact same neutral level.
[00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:20.300]   So if you look at, if you think about
[00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:23.480]   like cardiovascular adaptations to endurance training
[00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:25.120]   and any type of endurance training,
[00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:28.740]   a common thing people will understand is resting heart rate.
[00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:31.560]   And so what that number is is just how many beats per minute
[00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:33.520]   you're having when you're sitting here doing nothing.
[00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:36.680]   A very positive adaptation is a lowering
[00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:38.900]   of that resting rate over time.
[00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:40.520]   As general numbers, what you will hear
[00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:44.140]   is people will say things like a normal resting heart rate
[00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:46.460]   is between 60 to 80 beats per minute.
[00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:49.340]   And if any of the things I've talked about
[00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:52.240]   with the individuals I work with,
[00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:54.000]   I don't work with anybody with disease,
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.020]   just to clarify that.
[00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:56.860]   I don't do anything with disease management,
[00:43:56.860 --> 00:43:57.700]   treatment, anything.
[00:43:57.700 --> 00:44:00.480]   It's always about people who are in a good spot
[00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:02.760]   who want to optimize or get to the next level,
[00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:04.460]   whether this is professional athletes
[00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:07.400]   trying to peak for physical performance,
[00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:11.260]   or the folks in our rapid health optimization program
[00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:13.240]   that feel good, again, it's not disease stuff,
[00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:15.480]   and they want to feel incredible.
[00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:16.960]   One of the metrics we're gonna pay attention to
[00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:17.980]   is this resting heart rate.
[00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:19.240]   So here's what happens.
[00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:20.820]   As you improve your endurance,
[00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:23.680]   your resting heart rate will go down.
[00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:26.760]   If I see somebody over 70 beats per minute,
[00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:29.600]   unless something's going on, you're not physically fit.
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:31.280]   Regardless of whether or not that is quote unquote
[00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:32.520]   within the normative values,
[00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:36.440]   I want to see everybody sub 60 beats per minute, or close.
[00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:38.080]   That is not a difficult thing
[00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:40.240]   to really get to for most people.
[00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:43.460]   So if you train a lot, regardless of how you train,
[00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:46.780]   intervals, steady state, doesn't matter,
[00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:48.600]   that resting heart rate will come down.
[00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:53.040]   But since energy demands at rest haven't really changed,
[00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:55.200]   cardiac output stays the same.
[00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:58.880]   So what happens is stroke volume goes up.
[00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:01.600]   So literally, like we trained your quadriceps
[00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:03.960]   on the leg extension machine to get stronger,
[00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:06.580]   so you can produce more force per contraction,
[00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:08.600]   the heart will do the exact same thing.
[00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:11.600]   And so as you're able to get more of the blood
[00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:13.840]   out of your heart per pump,
[00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:16.800]   the heart realizes I don't need to pump as often.
[00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:18.840]   So that's the compensatory adaptation,
[00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:20.200]   which is saying, hey, look,
[00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:21.760]   I don't need to beat 60 times a minute,
[00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:23.700]   I now need to beat 55 times a minute
[00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:27.560]   because I'm getting the same amount of blood out per pump,
[00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:28.400]   chill.
[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:30.520]   And this is why your resting heart rate goes down,
[00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:32.100]   your resting stroke volume goes up,
[00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:34.800]   but your cardiac output is identical.
[00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:36.520]   So that's not a good metric of fitness,
[00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:37.680]   it's going to stay the same.
[00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:41.520]   Cardiac output will only adjust per energetic changes,
[00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:43.540]   energy requirements in the acute moment.
[00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:44.860]   How much do I need?
[00:45:44.860 --> 00:45:47.520]   Go, which is gonna be determined by ventilation.
[00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:49.720]   How much air am I bringing in and putting out?
[00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:51.280]   That's gonna determine cardiac output,
[00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:53.100]   and that's gonna determine where we're at.
[00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:56.140]   If you were to do like a submaximal exercise test,
[00:45:56.140 --> 00:45:59.600]   when you were unfit to when you're fit,
[00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:02.000]   or when you're fit to where you're super fit,
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.600]   at submax, you're gonna see the same thing.
[00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:06.040]   Cardiac output will be identical,
[00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:07.600]   and you're like, damn, nothing happened.
[00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:10.120]   What you're not realizing is your heart rate
[00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:12.140]   at that same workload is now lower.
[00:46:12.140 --> 00:46:16.040]   And that's efficiency because your stroke volume is higher.
[00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:18.320]   Where it gets people tripped up is at max,
[00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:22.240]   because you may not see much of a change at max,
[00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:23.980]   because you don't really see an increase
[00:46:23.980 --> 00:46:26.200]   in maximum heart rate with fitness, that's not a thing.
[00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:28.320]   So maximum heart rate is not a good proxy
[00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:31.080]   for fit or unfit or anything like that.
[00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:32.760]   Stroke volume will get limited eventually
[00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:34.800]   by filling capacity of your heart.
[00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:36.840]   It has to have so much time to fill up with blood
[00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:39.200]   before it can contract again and squeeze the blood out.
[00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:42.100]   And when you have a heart rate of 200 beats per minute,
[00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:43.880]   that just doesn't leave much time to fill.
[00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:45.680]   And so it won't really push you past that.
[00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:48.280]   So don't worry about trying to increase
[00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:49.640]   your maximum heart rate.
[00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:50.680]   That's not necessarily a good thing,
[00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:52.360]   and it won't really change.
[00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:53.480]   But your cardiac output will,
[00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:55.680]   because stroke volume will be higher.
[00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:56.960]   - But that doesn't necessarily mean
[00:46:56.960 --> 00:46:58.320]   that I should avoid training
[00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:00.560]   that gets me up toward maximum heart rate, correct?
[00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:01.720]   - Oh, you should absolutely do it.
[00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:03.860]   - Right, that was my assumption.
[00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:05.120]   I'd like to take a brief break
[00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:07.600]   and acknowledge our sponsor, Athletic Greens.
[00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:09.520]   Athletic Greens is a vitamin mineral
[00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:11.720]   probiotic and adaptogen drink
[00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:12.720]   designed to help you meet
[00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:15.200]   all of your foundational nutritional needs.
[00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:18.480]   I've been taking Athletic Greens daily since 2012.
[00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:21.080]   So I'm delighted that they're a sponsor of this podcast.
[00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:22.700]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:24.520]   and the reason I still take Athletic Greens
[00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:26.000]   once or twice a day
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:26.960]   is that it helps me meet
[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:29.040]   all of my foundational nutritional needs.
[00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:31.120]   That is, it covers my vitamins, my minerals,
[00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:33.680]   and the probiotics are especially important to me.
[00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:35.840]   Athletic Greens also contains adaptogens,
[00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:37.840]   which are critical for recovering from stress,
[00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:40.480]   from exercise, from work, or just general life.
[00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:41.860]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:44.580]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman

[00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:47.200]   They'll give you five free travel packs
[00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:50.640]   and they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:52.280]   Again, if you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:54.820]   go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:56.120]   to claim the special offer.
[00:47:56.120 --> 00:47:59.580]   Getting back to energy production and metabolism.
[00:47:59.580 --> 00:48:03.140]   So we've got these different modes of moving energy,
[00:48:03.140 --> 00:48:05.520]   but making and breaking energy bonds in the body,
[00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:08.200]   moving energy into different tissues
[00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:09.220]   and out of different tissues,
[00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:11.480]   and indeed out of the body through exhalation.
[00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:16.700]   How do each of these different modes of energy utilization
[00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:20.880]   relate to different modes of movement and exercise?
[00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:23.520]   In my mind, I'm starting to draw a bridge
[00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:28.020]   between, okay, when I walk for 60 minutes,
[00:48:28.020 --> 00:48:31.080]   if I'm talking, I'm breathing a bit more,
[00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:33.300]   maybe I'm burning a little more fat.
[00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:36.420]   After all, speech is a modified exhale.
[00:48:36.420 --> 00:48:41.780]   And if I'm sprinting, I'm breathing differently.
[00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:45.240]   And if I'm doing a 30 minute moderate,
[00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:47.200]   quote unquote, moderate jog, I'm breathing differently.
[00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:49.660]   So you've beautifully illustrated this bridge
[00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:52.180]   between energy production and utilization
[00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:56.140]   and carbon dioxide offload through exhalation.
[00:48:56.140 --> 00:48:59.800]   What are some of the specifics about energy utilization
[00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:02.560]   according to different modes of exercise?
[00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:05.360]   And if we could better define modes of exercise
[00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:08.020]   or types of exercise that trigger specific adaptations,
[00:49:08.020 --> 00:49:09.740]   I think this is where the bridge will move
[00:49:09.740 --> 00:49:12.580]   from being a mere line to a real structure.
[00:49:12.580 --> 00:49:13.780]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:16.620]   I want to lay one more foundational piece,
[00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:21.080]   and then it's going to be much easier to understand
[00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:23.860]   the limitations I put on some of these training protocols,
[00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:26.300]   as well as the lack of limitations.
[00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:28.220]   Okay, so it's really, really important.
[00:49:28.220 --> 00:49:30.740]   The way I want to start this is,
[00:49:30.740 --> 00:49:35.100]   we have this foundation now of carbon
[00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:37.460]   and basic energy production.
[00:49:37.460 --> 00:49:39.000]   That's not to say there's no difference.
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.020]   There is, and that difference is important.
[00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:43.180]   But maybe we can answer the question from earlier,
[00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:46.100]   which is actually something you asked me this morning
[00:49:46.100 --> 00:49:47.900]   when we were exercising.
[00:49:47.900 --> 00:49:50.820]   You're like, training fasted, right?
[00:49:50.820 --> 00:49:55.380]   Does training fasted enhance fat loss?
[00:49:55.380 --> 00:49:57.880]   And the logic is sound.
[00:49:57.880 --> 00:49:59.680]   If I don't have any fuel,
[00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:01.320]   then I should be burning more fat,
[00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:02.640]   therefore I shouldn't be losing more fat.
[00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:03.480]   It's sound.
[00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:05.100]   It's not true.
[00:50:05.100 --> 00:50:06.740]   It's this great idea.
[00:50:06.740 --> 00:50:08.260]   It's one of these classic things in science
[00:50:08.260 --> 00:50:11.260]   and exercise physiology where you're like, sounds good.
[00:50:11.260 --> 00:50:12.100]   Turns out it's not.
[00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:13.300]   It's actually a pretty gross
[00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:15.400]   misunderstanding of metabolism.
[00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:17.340]   So it's not to pick on that topic.
[00:50:17.340 --> 00:50:18.560]   I don't really care about that topic,
[00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:20.940]   but it's a common question.
[00:50:20.940 --> 00:50:22.500]   It also gives me an opportunity
[00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:24.620]   to just tell you more about metabolism.
[00:50:24.620 --> 00:50:27.680]   So here's what happens.
[00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:29.700]   You are breathing in O2 and breathing out CO2.
[00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:32.540]   However, the ratio to that is what we call
[00:50:32.540 --> 00:50:34.720]   the either RER, respiratory exchange ratio,
[00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:36.380]   or RQ, respiratory quotient.
[00:50:36.380 --> 00:50:37.760]   And I'm not gonna differentiate those two.
[00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:38.620]   They're not the same thing,
[00:50:38.620 --> 00:50:41.020]   but we're gonna skip past that for now.
[00:50:41.020 --> 00:50:44.260]   As you begin to increase exercise intensity,
[00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:48.420]   the percentage of O2 to CO2 rises in the favor of CO2.
[00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:50.860]   So you start breathing out way more CO2
[00:50:50.860 --> 00:50:53.400]   than you are breathing in O2.
[00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:55.780]   And so if we were to look at that number,
[00:50:55.780 --> 00:50:57.600]   what's the relationship, it goes up.
[00:50:57.600 --> 00:51:01.240]   So at rest, most people have a value
[00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:04.760]   that we would typically call something like 0.6.
[00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:06.100]   Okay, and that's, again,
[00:51:06.100 --> 00:51:08.600]   the relationship between O2 and CO2.
[00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:10.280]   Maybe 0.7.
[00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:12.760]   If you were to go for a walk, that increases slightly
[00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:16.120]   because you're now expiring CO2 at a higher rate.
[00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:19.400]   So now you've moved up to, say, 0.8 or something like that.
[00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:22.340]   One of the ways that we mark somebody achieving
[00:51:22.340 --> 00:51:27.000]   an actual VO2 max on a test is if that value exceeds 1.1.
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:30.860]   Now, any of you who are paying attention
[00:51:30.860 --> 00:51:31.840]   are thinking, well, wait a minute,
[00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:33.900]   how the hell can a ratio between two things
[00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:35.920]   ever get past one?
[00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:37.260]   Well, that's because you're getting to a place
[00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:40.580]   where you're actually offloading more CO2
[00:51:40.580 --> 00:51:42.080]   than is actually necessary.
[00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:44.320]   And this is what actually causes and explains
[00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:46.600]   a thing that people like to call EPOC,
[00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:49.720]   which is excess exercise post-oxygen consumption.
[00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:51.920]   This is another way to think about it.
[00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:54.960]   The only reason you're breathing is to bring in oxygen
[00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:57.220]   and offload CO2, right?
[00:51:57.220 --> 00:52:01.220]   If I'm no longer exercising, why am I still breathing?
[00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:05.440]   In other words, once you stop the demand
[00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:09.000]   or the need for energy, you should stop ventilating.
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:11.760]   But you don't, right?
[00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:14.960]   That's because in the case of low intensity exercise,
[00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:18.720]   the second you stop, you're right back down
[00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:20.200]   to respite ventilation.
[00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:22.240]   No problem, because you were able to match
[00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:24.960]   the need for energy with the offload of waste
[00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:27.660]   one to one during that exercise.
[00:52:27.660 --> 00:52:30.760]   When you start creeping up the intensity, you can't do that.
[00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:33.120]   So you have to basically start stealing
[00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:34.560]   a little bit of fuel here.
[00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:36.520]   So even though you're done exercising,
[00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:39.400]   you're still ventilating because you have to pay that back.
[00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:41.960]   And pay that back, by that I specifically mean
[00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:43.980]   you have to bring in oxygen.
[00:52:43.980 --> 00:52:45.280]   'Cause you have a whole bunch of waste
[00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:47.320]   that's been accumulating in your tissue
[00:52:47.320 --> 00:52:48.600]   that you've got to deal with.
[00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:50.800]   And I'll walk you through what that waste is.
[00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:52.480]   It's a particular molecule that a lot of people
[00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:54.540]   have heard of but grossly misunderstand.
[00:52:54.540 --> 00:52:56.640]   So you gotta be able to handle that.
[00:52:56.640 --> 00:52:59.800]   So the reason that you sit there and go (panting)
[00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:01.540]   and continue to ventilate is because you're now
[00:53:01.540 --> 00:53:05.320]   trying to pay back that excess post-exercise oxygen debt.
[00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:07.800]   That's that oxygen debt we're specifically talking about.
[00:53:07.800 --> 00:53:10.560]   All right, so that being said,
[00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:13.000]   as we start cruising up that RQ starts going up,
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:14.040]   up, up, up, up, up, up.
[00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:17.220]   And if we get to one, you're 1.0, you're in a,
[00:53:17.220 --> 00:53:18.060]   like you're hurting.
[00:53:18.060 --> 00:53:19.520]   You're in a pretty good spot.
[00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:20.520]   All right.
[00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:21.520]   - I like that, you're hurting.
[00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:22.960]   You're in a pretty good spot.
[00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:23.800]   - Yeah.
[00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:26.560]   - There's a window into Dr. Andy Galpin's mind.
[00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:28.000]   Now you really want to be a subject
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:29.680]   in his laboratory studies.
[00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:31.200]   - Sure.
[00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:33.340]   - Masochists swarm to Andy's lab.
[00:53:33.340 --> 00:53:34.280]   - Absolutely.
[00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:35.640]   All right.
[00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:40.640]   So the idea that I will lose more fat
[00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:44.960]   by being in an exercise situation that is burning more fat,
[00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:48.120]   it seems to make sense, but it's a massive failure
[00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:50.400]   to understand the metabolism.
[00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:51.920]   It's the exact same explanation
[00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:55.280]   to why exercising fasted doesn't matter.
[00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:58.080]   So the exercising fasted issue under normal circumstances
[00:53:58.080 --> 00:54:02.560]   is irrelevant because you have plenty of fuel in the system
[00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:05.040]   even when you haven't eaten breakfast that morning.
[00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:06.900]   Now, if you're talking like extended fasting
[00:54:06.900 --> 00:54:10.220]   over multiple days, this is a different scenario.
[00:54:10.220 --> 00:54:13.660]   If muscle glycogen, liver glycogen, and blood glucose
[00:54:13.660 --> 00:54:15.400]   are at sufficient levels,
[00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:17.180]   then you absolutely have enough energy
[00:54:17.180 --> 00:54:19.520]   to perform almost any type of exercise
[00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:21.400]   that most people are doing.
[00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:24.260]   You know, maybe if you're Rob and you're at mile 20 today,
[00:54:24.260 --> 00:54:25.100]   it's a different story,
[00:54:25.100 --> 00:54:26.080]   but the vast majority of us
[00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:27.520]   have plenty of fuel sitting around.
[00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:30.320]   So we're not going to burn more into fat
[00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:31.960]   just because we didn't eat breakfast that morning.
[00:54:31.960 --> 00:54:33.800]   So that just doesn't make energetic sense.
[00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:36.640]   We have a lot of backup supplies and you're never out.
[00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:38.040]   The trick here is this,
[00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:40.280]   there's a concept here we call crossover concept.
[00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:44.320]   So as we are starting to move up exercise intensity,
[00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:47.080]   we start burning a higher percentage of our fuel
[00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:51.060]   from carbohydrates and a lower percentage of our fuel
[00:54:51.060 --> 00:54:52.080]   coming from fat.
[00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:54.600]   I'm sleeping.
[00:54:54.600 --> 00:54:56.920]   That's the highest percentage of your fuel
[00:54:56.920 --> 00:54:58.020]   that will be coming from fat
[00:54:58.020 --> 00:54:59.740]   of any activity you could ever do.
[00:54:59.740 --> 00:55:02.900]   So if the theory that I'm going to stay at a lower intensity
[00:55:02.900 --> 00:55:05.040]   to burn more fat was true,
[00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:08.980]   the optimal fat burning strategy would then be to sleep.
[00:55:08.980 --> 00:55:11.300]   Like that doesn't make sense.
[00:55:11.300 --> 00:55:12.140]   Of course it doesn't.
[00:55:12.140 --> 00:55:14.800]   So why would then going at a slightly elevated rate
[00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:18.160]   somehow all of a sudden magically make you lose fat?
[00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:19.220]   It doesn't actually make sense.
[00:55:19.220 --> 00:55:20.060]   When you think about that,
[00:55:20.060 --> 00:55:21.940]   where you're like, oh yeah, there's no way.
[00:55:21.940 --> 00:55:24.520]   So it's a percentage trick.
[00:55:24.520 --> 00:55:26.880]   It's a difference between absolute and relative.
[00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:28.040]   This is what this confusion is.
[00:55:28.040 --> 00:55:31.320]   So yes, as you start doing lower intensity to exercise,
[00:55:31.320 --> 00:55:33.480]   whether you're faster or not, it's irrelevant,
[00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:34.780]   but lower intensity exercise,
[00:55:34.780 --> 00:55:38.760]   a greater percentage of your fuel is coming from fat.
[00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:43.220]   However, your total fuel expenditure is very low.
[00:55:43.220 --> 00:55:46.860]   So that whole total carbon balance
[00:55:46.860 --> 00:55:49.280]   is not really being shifted much.
[00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:52.600]   As you start exercising at a very high intensity,
[00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:55.140]   you actually start getting a higher percentage of your fuel
[00:55:55.140 --> 00:55:57.780]   from carbohydrate and a lower percentage from fat.
[00:55:57.780 --> 00:56:01.460]   In fact, at rest, about the highest you can get
[00:56:01.460 --> 00:56:05.360]   in most people is about 60% of your fuel from fat.
[00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:08.860]   As you're sleeping, you might be 70%,
[00:56:08.860 --> 00:56:10.900]   but you'll never be in a position ever,
[00:56:10.900 --> 00:56:14.020]   no matter what sort of thing you've heard on the internet,
[00:56:14.020 --> 00:56:16.480]   you'll never be in a situation
[00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:18.680]   where fat is your only fuel source.
[00:56:18.680 --> 00:56:23.180]   The highest I've probably ever seen is like 70%.
[00:56:23.180 --> 00:56:24.700]   You should probably be at about that.
[00:56:24.700 --> 00:56:27.740]   That's a kind of a good number to think, honestly.
[00:56:27.740 --> 00:56:29.500]   But people who understand a little bit
[00:56:29.500 --> 00:56:32.300]   about metabolism to be dangerous, but not enough,
[00:56:32.300 --> 00:56:35.020]   will throw out these terms like fat adapted.
[00:56:35.020 --> 00:56:36.620]   And fat adapted is a real thing,
[00:56:36.620 --> 00:56:39.940]   but it is a massive misunderstanding oftentimes.
[00:56:39.940 --> 00:56:42.020]   It is this idea of thinking like I can get to a spot
[00:56:42.020 --> 00:56:44.320]   where I'm maximizing fat burning.
[00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:49.080]   Maximizing fat burning and maximizing fat for exercise
[00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:51.500]   and maximizing fat loss over time
[00:56:51.500 --> 00:56:54.220]   are not the same thing at all.
[00:56:54.220 --> 00:56:55.360]   That's the confusion.
[00:56:55.360 --> 00:56:58.580]   So if you enhance fat oxidation in an exercise,
[00:56:58.580 --> 00:57:02.820]   that does not enhance fat loss per se, right?
[00:57:02.820 --> 00:57:05.780]   So this is a lot of the confusion that's happening, right?
[00:57:05.780 --> 00:57:08.760]   So as we start moving up, we can never get in a position
[00:57:08.760 --> 00:57:10.560]   where we're using fat only as a fuel.
[00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:13.980]   Again, at best, you're at 70% fat, 30% carbohydrate.
[00:57:13.980 --> 00:57:14.980]   For a lot of reasons,
[00:57:14.980 --> 00:57:17.320]   we probably just don't have time to get into today.
[00:57:17.320 --> 00:57:19.600]   However, the opposite is possible.
[00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:22.080]   When you get into true high intensity exercise,
[00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:26.680]   you'll be basically 100% carbohydrate and 0% fat, right?
[00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:27.540]   That is very possible.
[00:57:27.540 --> 00:57:29.320]   That in fact is 1.0.
[00:57:29.320 --> 00:57:30.160]   That's what I'd argue.
[00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:32.780]   1.1 is actually because your ventilation got so high,
[00:57:32.780 --> 00:57:34.780]   you actually exceeded that number,
[00:57:34.780 --> 00:57:37.380]   even though you're at 100% carbohydrate.
[00:57:37.380 --> 00:57:39.060]   This is what people came up with the idea then.
[00:57:39.060 --> 00:57:40.540]   It's like, well, I don't want to burn carbs.
[00:57:40.540 --> 00:57:42.140]   I want to lose fat.
[00:57:42.140 --> 00:57:44.940]   So my response to that is always like, okay, great.
[00:57:44.940 --> 00:57:45.780]   So it makes sense.
[00:57:45.780 --> 00:57:46.980]   Burning fat, losing fat.
[00:57:46.980 --> 00:57:48.680]   Burning carbs is losing what then?
[00:57:48.680 --> 00:57:51.180]   Like, do you think your liver shrunk?
[00:57:51.180 --> 00:57:53.580]   Like, wait a minute.
[00:57:53.580 --> 00:57:55.240]   What did you lose then?
[00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:56.080]   Where did it come from?
[00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:57.940]   It's all coming as carbon.
[00:57:57.940 --> 00:58:01.340]   Don't worry about where it came from for your fuel.
[00:58:01.340 --> 00:58:04.440]   It just has to come out as carbon, right?
[00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:07.220]   There are differences in exercise efficiency for performance
[00:58:07.220 --> 00:58:09.480]   with our professional athletes, of course.
[00:58:09.480 --> 00:58:11.700]   But if the only goal here is fat loss,
[00:58:11.700 --> 00:58:14.060]   it doesn't matter where you get it from.
[00:58:14.060 --> 00:58:15.740]   The last bridge we have to connect here is like,
[00:58:15.740 --> 00:58:16.700]   well, wait a minute.
[00:58:16.700 --> 00:58:19.860]   If I only burned carbohydrate,
[00:58:19.860 --> 00:58:21.460]   how did I actually lose that fat?
[00:58:21.460 --> 00:58:24.780]   There was that glove handle sitting on the side of me.
[00:58:24.780 --> 00:58:26.340]   How did that come out of me
[00:58:26.340 --> 00:58:28.360]   if I never burned that for my fuel?
[00:58:28.360 --> 00:58:29.700]   What you're failing to understand
[00:58:29.700 --> 00:58:31.860]   is there's a balance game that happens here.
[00:58:31.860 --> 00:58:34.020]   So if you were to do a bunch of high-intensity
[00:58:34.020 --> 00:58:37.940]   exercise training and you burned only muscle glycogen
[00:58:37.940 --> 00:58:40.620]   and blood glucose and maybe even you did it for so long,
[00:58:40.620 --> 00:58:42.360]   you burn some liver glycogen.
[00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:47.140]   The body understands that it has expelled a lot of energy
[00:58:47.140 --> 00:58:48.820]   from that side of the equation.
[00:58:48.820 --> 00:58:50.020]   It's going to do a couple of things.
[00:58:50.020 --> 00:58:53.380]   Now, it's very difficult to go through this fancy situation
[00:58:53.380 --> 00:58:56.740]   where you convert carbohydrates into fat and back and forth.
[00:58:56.740 --> 00:58:58.500]   Like that's actually like fairly hard.
[00:58:58.500 --> 00:59:00.680]   What's easier to do is something you said earlier
[00:59:00.680 --> 00:59:04.460]   is actually just bias energetics to a different fuel source.
[00:59:04.460 --> 00:59:08.540]   So in that scenario where you're down really low
[00:59:08.540 --> 00:59:11.260]   in your carbohydrate stores,
[00:59:11.260 --> 00:59:15.380]   any carbohydrates you bring in are going to go to storage.
[00:59:15.380 --> 00:59:17.540]   And since your net energy expenditure
[00:59:17.540 --> 00:59:19.580]   is something that your body regulates a lot,
[00:59:19.580 --> 00:59:21.300]   any fat that you then bring in
[00:59:21.300 --> 00:59:23.660]   is going to be utilized as a fuel source
[00:59:23.660 --> 00:59:25.460]   because it knows it doesn't need it anymore.
[00:59:25.460 --> 00:59:26.900]   That is an excess.
[00:59:26.900 --> 00:59:31.360]   So that's how you actually use fat as a fuel
[00:59:31.360 --> 00:59:34.220]   because you've burned down carbohydrate storages.
[00:59:34.220 --> 00:59:38.380]   - As I'm hearing this, a couple of things come to mind.
[00:59:38.380 --> 00:59:42.020]   First of all, thank you for that incredibly important
[00:59:42.020 --> 00:59:43.860]   description of what is otherwise
[00:59:43.860 --> 00:59:47.260]   a very confusing landscape for most people.
[00:59:47.260 --> 00:59:48.980]   One of the key points I took away,
[00:59:48.980 --> 00:59:51.720]   and I just want to say from the outset,
[00:59:51.720 --> 00:59:54.340]   this is not exhaustive by any stretch,
[00:59:54.340 --> 00:59:58.440]   is that burning fat does not equal losing fat from the body.
[00:59:58.440 --> 00:59:59.280]   - Correct.
[00:59:59.280 --> 01:00:01.180]   - And then burning fat has to be divided
[01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:04.340]   into burning of body fat stores.
[01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:08.340]   And we need to distinguish that from burning of dietary fat
[01:00:08.340 --> 01:00:09.580]   that is brought in.
[01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:12.500]   Oftentimes people don't disambiguate those.
[01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:13.840]   - Correct.
[01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:18.840]   - And I'm also understanding that reducing one's body
[01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:21.940]   carbohydrate stores, muscle glycogen, liver glycogen,
[01:00:21.940 --> 01:00:24.600]   et cetera, occurs during high intensity exercise.
[01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:25.440]   - Yep.
[01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:27.720]   - It goes other ways, but that is one very efficient way
[01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:32.260]   to tap into those stores, which makes me wonder,
[01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:33.780]   again, this is one of these things that
[01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:35.940]   does it lead to a protocol?
[01:00:35.940 --> 01:00:38.440]   Makes me wonder whether or not doing high intensity,
[01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:40.800]   let's say weight training for 45 to 60 minutes,
[01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:43.420]   75 minutes of strength training, power training,
[01:00:43.420 --> 01:00:46.140]   hypertrophy training, which we've covered in an episode
[01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:50.940]   about those topics, and then doing some steady state
[01:00:50.940 --> 01:00:54.260]   cardiovascular exercise, is there any benefit
[01:00:54.260 --> 01:00:58.540]   to that arrangement that would, quote unquote,
[01:00:58.540 --> 01:01:02.860]   enhance body fat loss from the body,
[01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:07.300]   to be very specific now, because unlike the idea
[01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:09.540]   that training fasted would shift the bias
[01:01:09.540 --> 01:01:12.740]   towards fat loss, which it doesn't, you've told us,
[01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:15.220]   under those conditions, muscle glycogen
[01:01:15.220 --> 01:01:18.340]   and maybe even liver glycogen is going to be depleted.
[01:01:18.340 --> 01:01:21.660]   Put simply, can I enhance body fat loss
[01:01:21.660 --> 01:01:24.800]   by doing some cardio after a bout of weight training?
[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:27.460]   - If you equate for total energy expenditure,
[01:01:27.460 --> 01:01:28.940]   it won't matter.
[01:01:28.940 --> 01:01:31.380]   Now, you did bring up a very important point
[01:01:31.380 --> 01:01:32.540]   that I want to clarify.
[01:01:32.540 --> 01:01:35.700]   If you look at the exercise modalities
[01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:38.540]   that we laid out in our previous conversations,
[01:01:38.540 --> 01:01:40.500]   we talked about nine different adaptations.
[01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:44.780]   One was skill, and then speed, power, strength,
[01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:47.540]   hypertrophy, muscular endurance, anaerobic capacity,
[01:01:47.540 --> 01:01:51.200]   aerobic capacity, and long duration endurance.
[01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:55.540]   Now, speed, power, and skill development
[01:01:55.540 --> 01:01:58.620]   have almost no benefit for fat loss.
[01:01:58.620 --> 01:02:02.500]   Because remember, those are low weight,
[01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:05.460]   a lot of rest, and low volume.
[01:02:05.460 --> 01:02:07.300]   They're not really going to be helpful.
[01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:10.420]   You can make a little bit of a case for strength,
[01:02:10.420 --> 01:02:13.140]   a little bit, but the total energy expenditure
[01:02:13.140 --> 01:02:14.700]   for strength training, even if it's an hour,
[01:02:14.700 --> 01:02:17.100]   if it's truly strength training, it's fairly low.
[01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:19.300]   - Because the repetitions are in the one to three range.
[01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:21.240]   - That's exactly, it's not enough for total work.
[01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:23.940]   So if you're trying to develop a protocol
[01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:26.180]   that sort of optimizes fat loss,
[01:02:26.180 --> 01:02:28.060]   which you want to do, you're close.
[01:02:28.060 --> 01:02:31.060]   In my opinion, is do a combination of something
[01:02:31.060 --> 01:02:35.340]   in the hypertrophy/muscular endurance
[01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:36.540]   strength training realm.
[01:02:36.540 --> 01:02:40.560]   - Okay, so six to 30 repetitions.
[01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:42.240]   - Something like that. - Of resistance training.
[01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:43.080]   - Great.
[01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:44.540]   - Deplete muscle glycogen, maybe even a bit
[01:02:44.540 --> 01:02:45.660]   of liver glycogen.
[01:02:45.660 --> 01:02:47.140]   - Maybe a little bit, depending on if you're doing it
[01:02:47.140 --> 01:02:49.980]   for a long time, but probably not a noticeable amount.
[01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:53.180]   - Okay, so an hour of hypertrophy type training.
[01:02:53.180 --> 01:02:54.820]   - If you're training hard with low rest intervals
[01:02:54.820 --> 01:02:56.820]   and you really did an hour, you would for sure get there.
[01:02:56.820 --> 01:02:57.900]   But most people don't.
[01:02:57.900 --> 01:03:00.220]   - Is that the reason why I crave large bowls
[01:03:00.220 --> 01:03:02.100]   of oatmeal and rice after I do weight training?
[01:03:02.100 --> 01:03:02.940]   - Yeah, I mean-- - I want to replenish
[01:03:02.940 --> 01:03:03.780]   muscle glycogen.
[01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:04.720]   - Totally, right?
[01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:09.860]   Then you maybe do a little bit of very high intensity,
[01:03:09.860 --> 01:03:13.160]   maximum heart rate, well over VO2 max,
[01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:17.220]   as hard as you can for 20, 30, 45, 60 seconds,
[01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:19.780]   something like that, with some recovery,
[01:03:19.780 --> 01:03:21.620]   a lot of recovery and repeated.
[01:03:21.620 --> 01:03:23.300]   And that's going to do a great job
[01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:25.860]   of replenishing muscle glycogen, right?
[01:03:25.860 --> 01:03:27.560]   And if you do that long enough, you'll get the liver,
[01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:28.680]   but again, most people don't,
[01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:31.320]   'cause it's really, really hard to go that hard.
[01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:33.340]   - So liver is sort of last resort.
[01:03:33.340 --> 01:03:34.460]   - Yeah, basic mechanics here,
[01:03:34.460 --> 01:03:38.660]   which we'll actually get into as our third segment here,
[01:03:38.660 --> 01:03:43.520]   is energy production comes from local exercising muscle,
[01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:44.360]   first and foremost,
[01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:47.520]   from phosphocreatine and carbohydrate stores, right?
[01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:48.980]   And so again, and we store it in muscle,
[01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:50.820]   we call it glycogen, right?
[01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:52.700]   That's just your first sign of light of defense.
[01:03:52.700 --> 01:03:55.380]   If you need glucose, outside of that,
[01:03:55.380 --> 01:03:57.000]   you're going to start pulling it from the blood.
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:57.840]   But one of the things,
[01:03:57.840 --> 01:03:59.340]   your body regulates a handful of things
[01:03:59.340 --> 01:04:01.820]   over almost everything, blood pH, blood glucose,
[01:04:01.820 --> 01:04:03.940]   blood pressure, and electrolyte concentrations.
[01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:05.260]   Like it really does not want to mess
[01:04:05.260 --> 01:04:06.380]   with those things at all.
[01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:08.100]   It will change almost anything else in the body
[01:04:08.100 --> 01:04:10.140]   to keep those things standardized, right?
[01:04:10.140 --> 01:04:13.260]   You generally, because you need all those things
[01:04:13.260 --> 01:04:15.780]   for your brain to work, and your brain will stop working.
[01:04:15.780 --> 01:04:17.620]   If you lose blood pressure, it won't go up there.
[01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:19.260]   pH changes, you can't run metabolism.
[01:04:19.260 --> 01:04:21.100]   Electrolytes change, you can't think.
[01:04:21.100 --> 01:04:23.900]   And glucose is a primary fuel source for the brain.
[01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:25.780]   It's going to be a problem, right?
[01:04:25.780 --> 01:04:27.200]   So if that number starts to come down
[01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:29.060]   because you're grabbing glucose out of the blood,
[01:04:29.060 --> 01:04:30.820]   your liver is going to then kick in.
[01:04:30.820 --> 01:04:32.400]   It's going to break down its glycogen
[01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:34.100]   to put glucose in the blood
[01:04:34.100 --> 01:04:35.860]   to keep the blood number at the level.
[01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:37.500]   In fact, one of the things you'll see
[01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:41.220]   is blood glucose concentrations rise during exercise.
[01:04:41.220 --> 01:04:42.340]   They don't fall.
[01:04:42.340 --> 01:04:44.780]   In fact, they rise as an anticipatory state.
[01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:46.920]   If you train a lot, your blood glucose will start going up
[01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:48.100]   before you start moving.
[01:04:48.100 --> 01:04:49.700]   It knows it's coming, right?
[01:04:49.700 --> 01:04:51.220]   So you can play that game.
[01:04:51.220 --> 01:04:53.320]   You can rob Peter to pay Paul for a long time
[01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:54.580]   until your liver runs out.
[01:04:54.580 --> 01:04:56.280]   And that's what actually is a bonk
[01:04:56.280 --> 01:04:58.700]   in terms of like long duration endurance stuff.
[01:04:58.700 --> 01:05:00.100]   You're talking many, many, many miles,
[01:05:00.100 --> 01:05:01.500]   several hours typically, we say,
[01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:03.680]   "Oh, it's gotta be over two hours"
[01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:05.680]   before your liver starts to become a real problem
[01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:08.240]   or it has to be tremendously intense
[01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:09.080]   because of those reasons.
[01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:12.200]   You have to burn through just a lot of energy
[01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:14.360]   before your liver starts to get into a problem.
[01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:15.460]   You can continue to train
[01:05:15.460 --> 01:05:17.700]   when your muscle glycogen levels are low.
[01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:20.380]   In fact, people say glycogen depletion in muscle,
[01:05:20.380 --> 01:05:22.660]   but it's generally a misnomer.
[01:05:22.660 --> 01:05:25.320]   And you are going to just have tremendous signals of fatigue
[01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:27.860]   when that number gets lower than 75%.
[01:05:27.860 --> 01:05:30.180]   So people think that like their muscles are getting heavy.
[01:05:30.180 --> 01:05:32.200]   You're probably still 75% full.
[01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:35.120]   A lot of folks will quit around the 50%.
[01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:38.260]   The highest I've ever seen is like 95% true depletion.
[01:05:38.260 --> 01:05:40.920]   And that's an extremely high level cross country skiers
[01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:43.080]   and like their deltoid gets very, very low.
[01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:45.700]   Some very talented runners will get fairly low
[01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:48.000]   in their quads, but the vast majority of folks,
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.480]   by the time you're 50% depleted, you're gonna quit.
[01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:52.940]   It's going to be really, really challenging.
[01:05:52.940 --> 01:05:55.100]   So you're never really going to get that low.
[01:05:55.100 --> 01:05:56.900]   It's like a bit of a protective mechanism, right?
[01:05:56.900 --> 01:06:00.080]   But when your liver gets low, you're gonna be shut down.
[01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:02.340]   And that's the case if you've ever been to like a marathon
[01:06:02.340 --> 01:06:04.980]   and you've seen people run like 25 and a half miles.
[01:06:04.980 --> 01:06:05.960]   And then they just like bonk.
[01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:08.140]   They go into like baby deer walking stance
[01:06:08.140 --> 01:06:08.980]   and then they collapse.
[01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:10.820]   And you're like, how are you mentally weak?
[01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:13.780]   Like you ran 26 miles and you can't run the last point.
[01:06:13.780 --> 01:06:14.660]   It ain't mentally weak.
[01:06:14.660 --> 01:06:17.300]   It is, if your liver is done, it's gonna stop you.
[01:06:17.300 --> 01:06:19.060]   'Cause there's no more backup reserves.
[01:06:19.060 --> 01:06:21.980]   Muscle you can get away with, you can push through it.
[01:06:21.980 --> 01:06:23.780]   Liver will not let you go any farther.
[01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:26.240]   - I find this fascinating because it makes me wonder
[01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:30.480]   whether or not the liver being depleted sends a neural
[01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:31.540]   signal to the brain.
[01:06:31.540 --> 01:06:32.380]   - Oh, absolutely.
[01:06:32.380 --> 01:06:34.380]   - Or the brain must register some signal.
[01:06:34.380 --> 01:06:36.780]   Like I would like to be alive tomorrow.
[01:06:36.780 --> 01:06:37.620]   Thank you.
[01:06:37.620 --> 01:06:39.780]   Whatever is happening right now.
[01:06:39.780 --> 01:06:43.140]   Stopping is going to be safer than continuing.
[01:06:43.140 --> 01:06:47.300]   And so that stop signal is one that I think a lot of people,
[01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:49.220]   including myself, are intrigued by.
[01:06:49.220 --> 01:06:52.100]   Because we always think that it's related to willpower.
[01:06:52.100 --> 01:06:54.900]   But the brain needs to preserve itself.
[01:06:54.900 --> 01:06:57.020]   And as the master computer, I mean,
[01:06:57.020 --> 01:07:00.340]   there are ways to go into kind of automaton type,
[01:07:00.340 --> 01:07:03.180]   not thinking, just doing type of behavior.
[01:07:03.180 --> 01:07:04.620]   - You have override switches, right?
[01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:07.000]   And you can play those cards and you can get better
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:10.220]   at learning and being less sensitive to that switch.
[01:07:10.220 --> 01:07:13.060]   That's exactly what happened when you first start training.
[01:07:13.060 --> 01:07:14.860]   You start to realize like, oh my gosh, I'm super tired.
[01:07:14.860 --> 01:07:15.740]   And then you realize really quickly like,
[01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:17.120]   oh, I'm totally fine here.
[01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:21.780]   And this is like the, pick your person who's made sayings
[01:07:21.780 --> 01:07:22.620]   like this, but it's like,
[01:07:22.620 --> 01:07:26.860]   you're really only 10% depleted or 30% or 40% or something.
[01:07:26.860 --> 01:07:29.000]   - We're all operating 40% of what we could do.
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:29.840]   - Of course.
[01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:30.660]   Any of those things are true
[01:07:30.660 --> 01:07:32.860]   because it is like a little bit of an override.
[01:07:32.860 --> 01:07:34.040]   You've just gotten very sensitive
[01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:35.900]   to being a small percentage depleted
[01:07:35.900 --> 01:07:37.420]   and you've learned, okay, I'm tired.
[01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:40.660]   And there is a long way to go past that.
[01:07:40.660 --> 01:07:42.000]   But once you get past that
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.060]   and you flip that override switch a lot,
[01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:47.100]   you just, you're going to break quickly.
[01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:49.540]   Because you've basically learned to ignore that signal
[01:07:49.540 --> 01:07:52.540]   and problems can happen really quickly after that.
[01:07:52.540 --> 01:07:55.100]   And that's even experienced endurance athletes.
[01:07:55.100 --> 01:07:56.740]   If you hit that level,
[01:07:56.740 --> 01:07:59.100]   it's like you're going to be hitting the concrete next.
[01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:01.260]   And that's potentially a problem.
[01:08:01.260 --> 01:08:03.540]   - I want to make sure I understand a concept
[01:08:03.540 --> 01:08:05.900]   that you referred to earlier correctly
[01:08:05.900 --> 01:08:08.020]   because I have a feeling that I don't.
[01:08:08.020 --> 01:08:12.540]   And that's this issue of how the body
[01:08:12.540 --> 01:08:17.540]   accesses body fat stores when in a sub-caloric state.
[01:08:19.900 --> 01:08:23.500]   And I'm doing mainly glycogen burning exercise.
[01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:24.700]   - Yeah.
[01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:25.780]   - What I heard you say,
[01:08:25.780 --> 01:08:29.440]   and please correct me where I'm undoubtedly wrong.
[01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:32.900]   What I heard you say was that,
[01:08:32.900 --> 01:08:37.900]   okay, I go into the gym and I start lifting weights.
[01:08:37.900 --> 01:08:40.520]   I'm burning muscle glycogen,
[01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:42.620]   mostly local to the muscles that I'm using.
[01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:45.860]   And then I start pulling glycogen from the bloodstream.
[01:08:45.860 --> 01:08:50.040]   Maybe there's some body fat stores that are mobilized,
[01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:53.780]   probably not dipping into my liver glycogen.
[01:08:53.780 --> 01:08:55.180]   Okay, I complete the workout.
[01:08:55.180 --> 01:08:58.620]   Maybe I even hop on the airdyne bike and do a little sprint.
[01:08:58.620 --> 01:08:59.500]   - Yeah. - I go for a jog.
[01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:02.660]   Maybe I eat immediately afterward.
[01:09:02.660 --> 01:09:04.500]   Maybe I don't eat for a few hours afterwards.
[01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:06.540]   But across the day,
[01:09:06.540 --> 01:09:09.560]   I ingest fewer calories than I burn.
[01:09:12.260 --> 01:09:17.040]   Is it the case that body fat is mobilized
[01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:19.320]   in order to replace the glycogen
[01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:24.320]   that my sub-caloric intake was insufficient to provide?
[01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:26.160]   In other words,
[01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:29.940]   because I didn't eat enough to fill the glycogen stores,
[01:09:29.940 --> 01:09:33.380]   am I using body fat converted into glycogen
[01:09:33.380 --> 01:09:34.340]   to fill those stores?
[01:09:34.340 --> 01:09:35.940]   - Right.
[01:09:35.940 --> 01:09:37.300]   - And if so,
[01:09:37.300 --> 01:09:41.140]   is that a case where I'm no longer exhaling carbons
[01:09:41.140 --> 01:09:42.620]   in order to burn body fat,
[01:09:42.620 --> 01:09:45.500]   but rather I'm repurposing body fat into muscle?
[01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:48.580]   Have I turned fat into muscle in that case?
[01:09:48.580 --> 01:09:50.860]   - Yeah, I'm really glad you asked this
[01:09:50.860 --> 01:09:52.940]   because I did a very poor job
[01:09:52.940 --> 01:09:55.380]   on that last point talking about it earlier.
[01:09:55.380 --> 01:09:57.260]   I'm realizing, playing back in my head,
[01:09:57.260 --> 01:09:58.980]   because that's so many really good questions.
[01:09:58.980 --> 01:10:01.940]   You cannot turn fat into muscle.
[01:10:01.940 --> 01:10:03.120]   - Can you turn muscle into fat?
[01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:03.960]   - No.
[01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:06.620]   - I'm so glad you said that because when I was in college,
[01:10:06.620 --> 01:10:10.720]   I don't want to out that person.
[01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:14.980]   The physiology teacher seemed to think still at that point
[01:10:14.980 --> 01:10:18.560]   that one could lift weights, get muscular,
[01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:20.740]   but then it would eventually turn into body fat.
[01:10:20.740 --> 01:10:23.580]   That myth has, I think, largely been dispelled.
[01:10:23.580 --> 01:10:27.260]   - I heard that so many times as a kid.
[01:10:27.260 --> 01:10:28.560]   I heard it so many times in college.
[01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:33.360]   I hear it so many times in our undergraduate students
[01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:35.160]   from other faculty and such.
[01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:39.160]   So no, they're not the same structures.
[01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:41.220]   - They are very different.
[01:10:41.220 --> 01:10:43.280]   Let me take a shot at answering this better.
[01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:44.660]   You were really, really, really close.
[01:10:44.660 --> 01:10:48.300]   So yeah, if you were to do that type of exercise
[01:10:48.300 --> 01:10:49.980]   where you've burned a lot of muscle glycogen,
[01:10:49.980 --> 01:10:53.560]   how is it I'm losing stored fat?
[01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:54.780]   That's really the crux of the question.
[01:10:54.780 --> 01:10:56.880]   And it doesn't even actually matter
[01:10:56.880 --> 01:11:00.300]   if you then went ahead and ingested carbohydrates
[01:11:00.300 --> 01:11:02.560]   or fat post-exercise.
[01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:03.780]   That's not really a thing.
[01:11:03.780 --> 01:11:04.840]   You hit on a couple of key things.
[01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:06.500]   Number one, this is all under the assumption
[01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:10.920]   that total caloric intake is still low, right?
[01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:12.460]   You have to have-- - Low total need.
[01:11:12.460 --> 01:11:14.460]   - Below total need, right. - Okay.
[01:11:14.460 --> 01:11:17.420]   - I also wanna flag calories in, calories out
[01:11:17.420 --> 01:11:20.220]   is not the only thing that matters.
[01:11:20.220 --> 01:11:21.980]   This is a very complex thing.
[01:11:21.980 --> 01:11:23.900]   Calories in is incredibly complicated.
[01:11:23.900 --> 01:11:26.500]   Calories out is even more complicated, okay?
[01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:31.500]   So we just, maybe another series we can spend on that alone.
[01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:34.100]   So don't go nuts about that.
[01:11:34.100 --> 01:11:36.860]   You have to be hypocaloric one way or the other.
[01:11:36.860 --> 01:11:39.320]   If you burn a bunch of muscle glycogen
[01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:43.060]   and you are hypercaloric, you're still going to add fat.
[01:11:43.060 --> 01:11:44.700]   If you burn a bunch of muscle glycogen
[01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:48.260]   and you're hypocaloric, you're going to lose fat, right?
[01:11:48.260 --> 01:11:49.420]   Think about it this way.
[01:11:49.420 --> 01:11:52.020]   You're in a negative calorie state.
[01:11:52.020 --> 01:11:55.380]   Where are those calories going to come from?
[01:11:55.380 --> 01:11:56.200]   Are you going to reduce
[01:11:56.200 --> 01:11:58.620]   your muscle glycogen storages permanently?
[01:11:58.620 --> 01:11:59.640]   - No. - No.
[01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:03.100]   Are you gonna reduce your glycogen storage in your liver?
[01:12:03.100 --> 01:12:05.300]   - No. - You wanna reduce blood glucose?
[01:12:05.300 --> 01:12:07.180]   - No. - No way, right?
[01:12:07.180 --> 01:12:10.100]   So where is that extra energy coming from?
[01:12:10.100 --> 01:12:11.700]   It's coming from your stored fat.
[01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:14.720]   It is your backup reserve energy system.
[01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:16.860]   The way that I wanna flag this here is
[01:12:16.860 --> 01:12:18.280]   people tend to think about it as like
[01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:20.220]   carbohydrates versus fat.
[01:12:20.220 --> 01:12:23.060]   That's not, it's more like a chain, more like a bicycle
[01:12:23.060 --> 01:12:24.880]   where there's a front gear and a back gear.
[01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:26.860]   You turn one gear, it turns the other one.
[01:12:26.860 --> 01:12:28.260]   These are complimentary systems.
[01:12:28.260 --> 01:12:30.960]   They are not and/or systems, right?
[01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:33.380]   You're turning one and when we go through carbohydrate
[01:12:33.380 --> 01:12:35.840]   metabolism, maybe here in a second,
[01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:38.480]   you'll understand why you have to have an anaerobic
[01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:39.820]   and an aerobic component to that.
[01:12:39.820 --> 01:12:41.600]   There is absolutely no way to complete
[01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:44.880]   carbohydrate metabolism without oxygen.
[01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:46.200]   That has to happen.
[01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:49.120]   The only way to engage in fat metabolism
[01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:50.560]   is aerobic and oxygen.
[01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:52.240]   There's no anaerobic component to it.
[01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:54.240]   There's a fundamental difference there.
[01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:58.280]   So your carbohydrates are meant to be incredibly flexible.
[01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:00.300]   It is the primary fuel source for a reason.
[01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:02.520]   Your fat is not meant to be flexible.
[01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:04.920]   It is meant to be unlimited.
[01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:06.540]   That's the basic point.
[01:13:06.540 --> 01:13:08.340]   So you want flexibility over here
[01:13:08.340 --> 01:13:10.100]   and an unlimited capacity over there.
[01:13:10.100 --> 01:13:14.460]   Now I'm safeguarded against any energetic need, okay?
[01:13:14.460 --> 01:13:16.880]   I need to run up a hill for safety.
[01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:18.700]   Cool, carbohydrates are there.
[01:13:18.700 --> 01:13:20.960]   I need to then run for 17 hours.
[01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:22.640]   Cool, fat is there.
[01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:24.620]   We want both of these systems.
[01:13:24.620 --> 01:13:27.460]   You wanna be able to have great energy throughout the day.
[01:13:27.460 --> 01:13:29.560]   You want a slow drip coming from fat.
[01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:32.220]   You don't want up and down, up and down.
[01:13:32.220 --> 01:13:33.480]   Feel great, up and down.
[01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:34.320]   Awesome.
[01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:35.560]   You wanna be able to think very quickly
[01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:36.740]   and get hyper focused.
[01:13:36.740 --> 01:13:38.700]   Boom, carbohydrates ramp right up, right?
[01:13:38.700 --> 01:13:40.340]   Get it into the brain, get thinking better,
[01:13:40.340 --> 01:13:41.180]   get thinking clearly fast.
[01:13:41.180 --> 01:13:43.880]   So we want all these, not just for exercise purposes,
[01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:45.620]   but for activities of daily living.
[01:13:45.620 --> 01:13:47.300]   We want an optimal system here.
[01:13:47.300 --> 01:13:50.080]   And when people use the terms like fat adapted,
[01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:52.500]   they're generally hijacking that and they're thinking.
[01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:54.920]   It used to be a thing we said all the time
[01:13:54.920 --> 01:13:57.940]   in like all of my undergraduate classes for years.
[01:13:57.940 --> 01:14:00.820]   And that idea of metabolic flexibility
[01:14:00.820 --> 01:14:03.460]   is using optimal fuel sources and optimal types,
[01:14:03.460 --> 01:14:05.540]   not maximizing fat usage.
[01:14:05.540 --> 01:14:07.440]   The people have co-opted that term
[01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:08.800]   of metabolic flexibility to be like,
[01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:10.740]   oh yeah, yeah, therefore learn how to maximize fat burning.
[01:14:10.740 --> 01:14:12.020]   That's not what that term means.
[01:14:12.020 --> 01:14:14.180]   That term means maximizing your ability
[01:14:14.180 --> 01:14:16.780]   to use whatever fuel is optimal in that time.
[01:14:16.780 --> 01:14:20.200]   Now I'll grant you, most people aren't fantastic
[01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:22.220]   at using fat as a fuel source
[01:14:22.220 --> 01:14:24.300]   relative to the other direction.
[01:14:24.300 --> 01:14:26.420]   But nonetheless, the gold standard here
[01:14:26.420 --> 01:14:28.380]   should be maximizing both.
[01:14:28.380 --> 01:14:30.180]   All right, finally answering your question.
[01:14:30.180 --> 01:14:34.060]   If I were to burn a bunch of muscle glycogen,
[01:14:34.060 --> 01:14:35.520]   how am I losing that fat?
[01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:38.740]   Well, the fuel you're ingesting in that hypochloric state
[01:14:38.740 --> 01:14:40.060]   is going to say, hey look,
[01:14:40.060 --> 01:14:43.120]   we have a lot of muscle glycogen we have to replenish.
[01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:45.280]   So any carbohydrate that comes in
[01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:48.620]   needs to be biased towards storage.
[01:14:48.620 --> 01:14:50.740]   It's gotta go into those tissue.
[01:14:50.740 --> 01:14:54.000]   Any fat that comes in or doesn't even come in,
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.220]   but any fat that we're using for fuel
[01:14:56.220 --> 01:14:58.460]   needs to be utilized for activity.
[01:14:58.460 --> 01:15:01.900]   And that's where the caloric expenditure from fat comes in.
[01:15:01.900 --> 01:15:06.620]   So you're basically saying your general physiology,
[01:15:06.620 --> 01:15:10.020]   the energy for that starts coming from fat.
[01:15:10.020 --> 01:15:13.040]   And the energy that's coming in from carbohydrate
[01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:14.460]   needs to be simply stored.
[01:15:14.460 --> 01:15:17.140]   And so what you see is your respiratory quotient changes.
[01:15:17.140 --> 01:15:18.860]   All right, the RER is going off.
[01:15:18.860 --> 01:15:20.740]   And so in the exercise moment,
[01:15:20.740 --> 01:15:23.020]   it shot way up for carbohydrates
[01:15:23.020 --> 01:15:26.200]   and shot way down for fat.
[01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:29.980]   As a compensatory response, it goes the other direction
[01:15:29.980 --> 01:15:32.620]   because your body's saying we are low on carbohydrates.
[01:15:32.620 --> 01:15:36.800]   Don't use them for fuel unless we absolutely have to, right?
[01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:38.260]   So use them for storage.
[01:15:38.260 --> 01:15:41.860]   Get our fuel from the fat side of the equation.
[01:15:41.860 --> 01:15:44.180]   And so what you're generally going to say is like,
[01:15:44.180 --> 01:15:47.420]   oh, I'm burning more fat just sitting around
[01:15:47.420 --> 01:15:48.340]   after things like that.
[01:15:48.340 --> 01:15:52.860]   And that's not even taking into the equation the epoch part,
[01:15:52.860 --> 01:15:55.360]   which is like, it's not actually as large as people think.
[01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:57.340]   It is, it's fairly small.
[01:15:57.340 --> 01:15:59.580]   But it is, it adds up sort of over time.
[01:15:59.580 --> 01:16:01.500]   So does that explain a little bit better
[01:16:01.500 --> 01:16:02.820]   about how you lose fat
[01:16:02.820 --> 01:16:05.940]   when you actually only burn carbs for exercise?
[01:16:05.940 --> 01:16:08.540]   - Yeah, you explained it beautifully.
[01:16:08.540 --> 01:16:12.700]   You talked about epoch, the post-exercise oxygen consumption,
[01:16:12.700 --> 01:16:16.800]   not being that significant in terms of energy utilization.
[01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:19.020]   Even though today we're talking about endurance
[01:16:19.020 --> 01:16:20.660]   and different forms of endurance,
[01:16:20.660 --> 01:16:23.500]   I do have to ask whether or not people consider
[01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:28.080]   the elevation in basal metabolism
[01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:31.320]   that occurs when there's more muscle around
[01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:34.300]   because muscle is such a metabolically demanding tissue.
[01:16:34.300 --> 01:16:40.180]   Is there a straightforward-ish equation?
[01:16:40.180 --> 01:16:45.180]   If one adds one pound of lean muscle tissue to their body,
[01:16:45.180 --> 01:16:48.140]   even if it's distributed across multiple muscle groups,
[01:16:48.140 --> 01:16:51.200]   does that equate to a caloric need
[01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:53.400]   of X number of calories per day?
[01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:57.240]   And is that because of the muscle protein synthesis needs
[01:16:57.240 --> 01:17:00.620]   of that muscle or its glycogen storage needs or both?
[01:17:00.620 --> 01:17:02.660]   - If you don't have enough muscle,
[01:17:02.660 --> 01:17:04.700]   you start to have problems with fat loss.
[01:17:04.700 --> 01:17:05.780]   It's a difficult challenge.
[01:17:05.780 --> 01:17:07.700]   If you have enough muscle
[01:17:07.700 --> 01:17:09.660]   and you're just trying to get extremely large,
[01:17:09.660 --> 01:17:13.260]   if your FFMI is 24 and you're 15% body fat,
[01:17:13.260 --> 01:17:14.900]   adding more muscle's not really gonna play a lot
[01:17:14.900 --> 01:17:17.100]   in the equation, and here's why.
[01:17:17.100 --> 01:17:21.200]   Muscle is more metabolically active at rest than fat,
[01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:22.380]   but fat is not inert.
[01:17:22.380 --> 01:17:25.860]   So fat is still going to burn a small number of calories.
[01:17:25.860 --> 01:17:26.700]   Muscle burns more,
[01:17:26.700 --> 01:17:29.200]   but it's not nearly what people think it is.
[01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:31.380]   I'm a muscle guy, I'm a muscle physiologist.
[01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:34.420]   I would love to get people to have more muscle
[01:17:34.420 --> 01:17:36.420]   for any excuse I can.
[01:17:36.420 --> 01:17:38.660]   It's not honest to say that though.
[01:17:38.660 --> 01:17:41.700]   You're talking about when I was in undergraduate,
[01:17:41.700 --> 01:17:45.260]   we would say numbers like 50 kcals per day per pound
[01:17:45.260 --> 01:17:46.240]   is what you can look at, right?
[01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:48.960]   So if you put on a pound of muscle spread across the body,
[01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:50.340]   your basal metabolic rate would go up
[01:17:50.340 --> 01:17:53.700]   by around 50 calories per day.
[01:17:53.700 --> 01:17:55.880]   I think that number is grossly exaggerated.
[01:17:55.880 --> 01:18:00.880]   It's probably a 10th of that, six to 10 calories.
[01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:04.400]   Maybe, it's hard to know exactly what that number is,
[01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:07.260]   but the more recent estimates are something like that.
[01:18:07.260 --> 01:18:08.740]   So now on one hand, you could say,
[01:18:08.740 --> 01:18:10.500]   oh my gosh, that is not even meaningful.
[01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:12.500]   The other hand, you could say that's super meaningful.
[01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:15.020]   It just depends on time domain you wanna put that out, right?
[01:18:15.020 --> 01:18:17.420]   So if you were to put on five pounds of muscle
[01:18:17.420 --> 01:18:20.820]   and your basal metabolic rate went up 30 or 40 calories
[01:18:20.820 --> 01:18:24.280]   a day, well, over the course of a thousand days,
[01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:25.580]   like that actually adds up.
[01:18:25.580 --> 01:18:27.580]   So you could slice this any way you want.
[01:18:27.580 --> 01:18:30.020]   Now, maybe that number is somewhere in between.
[01:18:30.020 --> 01:18:30.860]   I don't really know.
[01:18:30.860 --> 01:18:34.380]   It's not a field I paid that much attention to candidly
[01:18:34.380 --> 01:18:36.820]   because it's not a metric kind of like epoch
[01:18:36.820 --> 01:18:41.180]   where it's like, we used to really harp on it
[01:18:41.180 --> 01:18:42.020]   and now it's sort of like,
[01:18:42.020 --> 01:18:45.580]   well, maybe we exaggerated that like honestly just a bit.
[01:18:45.580 --> 01:18:47.160]   But to me, it doesn't change the equation much
[01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:49.700]   because if you don't have enough muscle, as I described,
[01:18:49.700 --> 01:18:51.000]   there are other consequences
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.060]   that are gonna make fat loss hard.
[01:18:53.060 --> 01:18:56.000]   And so you need to have sufficient muscle.
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:01.300]   If the additional caloric expenditure is the carrot, great.
[01:19:01.300 --> 01:19:03.500]   If it's something else, I don't really care.
[01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:05.900]   There's just enough evidence that you need to have it.
[01:19:05.900 --> 01:19:07.260]   Or I should say there's enough evidence
[01:19:07.260 --> 01:19:09.560]   that it will really help you in your path.
[01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:13.300]   Maybe a few calories here or there is not really the thing.
[01:19:13.300 --> 01:19:17.700]   Especially if you understand a normal food item,
[01:19:17.700 --> 01:19:19.720]   anything you pick
[01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:22.920]   is going to be probably a couple of hundred calories.
[01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:26.160]   One bad food choice a day will outkick
[01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:27.800]   almost any amount of coverage you got
[01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:29.260]   on adding muscle mass to you.
[01:19:29.260 --> 01:19:32.040]   So like you're really stepping over a dollar
[01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:33.760]   to pick up a dime if you're worried about
[01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:36.440]   how many calories you're getting from adding muscle.
[01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:38.640]   Fat loss is gonna be about regulating that carbon intake
[01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:40.200]   above and beyond anything else.
[01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:42.640]   - I'd like to take a brief break
[01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:45.240]   to acknowledge our sponsor, InsideTracker.
[01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:47.560]   InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:50.220]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[01:19:50.220 --> 01:19:51.820]   to help you better understand your body
[01:19:51.820 --> 01:19:53.700]   and help you reach your health goals.
[01:19:53.700 --> 01:19:56.200]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[01:19:56.200 --> 01:19:58.580]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[01:19:58.580 --> 01:20:00.440]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[01:20:00.440 --> 01:20:02.560]   and wellbeing can only be analyzed
[01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:03.760]   from a quality blood test.
[01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:05.100]   One issue with a lot of blood tests
[01:20:05.100 --> 01:20:06.500]   and DNA tests out there, however,
[01:20:06.500 --> 01:20:08.720]   is that you get information back about various levels
[01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:11.720]   of lipids and hormones and metabolic factors, et cetera,
[01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:13.720]   but you don't know what to do with that information.
[01:20:13.720 --> 01:20:15.280]   InsideTracker makes knowing what to do
[01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:17.880]   with all that information exceedingly easy.
[01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:19.720]   They have a personalized platform
[01:20:19.720 --> 01:20:22.400]   that lets you see what your specific numbers are, of course,
[01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:25.840]   but then also what sorts of behavioral dos and don'ts,
[01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:27.320]   what sorts of nutritional changes,
[01:20:27.320 --> 01:20:29.400]   what sorts of supplementation would allow you
[01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:31.160]   to bring those levels into the ranges
[01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:32.680]   that are optimal for you.
[01:20:32.680 --> 01:20:34.040]   If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
[01:20:34.040 --> 01:20:36.680]   you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman
[01:20:36.680 --> 01:20:39.240]   to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans.
[01:20:39.240 --> 01:20:43.560]   Again, that's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off.
[01:20:43.560 --> 01:20:45.360]   So I've heard about this concept
[01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:48.600]   of metabolic flexibility mentioned a few times.
[01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:50.640]   Frankly, you're the first person who's ever explained it
[01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:53.320]   to me in a clear and concise way.
[01:20:53.320 --> 01:20:57.420]   How do I know if I am metabolically flexible
[01:20:57.420 --> 01:21:00.400]   and how do I increase my metabolic flexibility?
[01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:03.200]   - Sure, there's no specific standard,
[01:21:03.200 --> 01:21:06.440]   which is actually a good thing, right?
[01:21:06.440 --> 01:21:10.160]   And so if you have a level of specificity
[01:21:10.160 --> 01:21:13.880]   that you want or need metabolically,
[01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:16.360]   then you don't actually want to be in this middle ground.
[01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:20.520]   An example would be if you are performing
[01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:23.420]   in a type of exercise or an athlete who performs in a sport
[01:21:23.420 --> 01:21:25.720]   that is glycolytically dominated,
[01:21:25.720 --> 01:21:29.500]   you don't want to be optimally metabolically flexible.
[01:21:29.500 --> 01:21:31.640]   You don't wanna be super quote unquote fat adapted.
[01:21:31.640 --> 01:21:34.240]   You wanna be biased towards the energy you're going to use.
[01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:36.380]   The same could be true for the other end of the spectrum.
[01:21:36.380 --> 01:21:37.740]   So in those particular cases,
[01:21:37.740 --> 01:21:40.540]   it's not optimal to be equally effective
[01:21:40.540 --> 01:21:44.620]   because there are no free passes in physiology, right?
[01:21:44.620 --> 01:21:49.240]   Your energy producing systems
[01:21:49.240 --> 01:21:51.680]   will upregulate or downregulate accordingly.
[01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:54.120]   So you will actually limit your ability to say,
[01:21:54.120 --> 01:21:56.840]   maximally utilize carbohydrates as a fuel
[01:21:56.840 --> 01:21:58.820]   if you're trying to upregulate your ability
[01:21:58.820 --> 01:21:59.820]   to use fat as a fuel.
[01:21:59.820 --> 01:22:02.280]   And so this is like, there's a saturation point.
[01:22:02.280 --> 01:22:04.880]   Outside of that spectrum, most people would just say,
[01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:06.600]   "Hey, I wanna feel great throughout the day
[01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:08.060]   to be able to do a bunch of different things."
[01:22:08.060 --> 01:22:08.900]   How do you know?
[01:22:08.900 --> 01:22:09.880]   A couple of things.
[01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:12.880]   There's a lot of biological markers you can take.
[01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:15.080]   There's also just some practical takes.
[01:22:15.080 --> 01:22:19.920]   Now, none of these markers by themselves are any sign.
[01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:22.560]   What you wanna do is probably a couple of them
[01:22:22.560 --> 01:22:24.720]   and then say, "Okay, this is maybe a clue."
[01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:26.480]   So again, it's really important to emphasize
[01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:28.320]   not a single one of these tests
[01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:30.280]   that I'm about to walk you through
[01:22:30.280 --> 01:22:32.560]   automatically means you can't use fat as a fuel
[01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:33.700]   or the other case,
[01:22:33.700 --> 01:22:36.220]   which is maybe you're poor at using carbohydrate as a fuel.
[01:22:36.220 --> 01:22:41.220]   So disclaimers aside, we'll get into a couple of them.
[01:22:41.220 --> 01:22:45.760]   - So should we think about these as informative and useful,
[01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:47.140]   but not diagnostic?
[01:22:47.140 --> 01:22:47.980]   - Exactly.
[01:22:47.980 --> 01:22:51.000]   We would call this data-inspired or data-led
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:52.040]   and not data-driven.
[01:22:52.040 --> 01:22:53.760]   - Great.
[01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:54.580]   - Okay, cool.
[01:22:54.580 --> 01:22:56.180]   So number one, you wanna think about
[01:22:56.180 --> 01:22:57.460]   just overall functionality.
[01:22:57.460 --> 01:22:59.980]   Do you have a reasonable regulation of your energy
[01:22:59.980 --> 01:23:01.140]   throughout the day?
[01:23:01.140 --> 01:23:02.640]   Now, many things could be going into this,
[01:23:02.640 --> 01:23:04.540]   which is why these are not specific diagnostics.
[01:23:04.540 --> 01:23:07.400]   But as a basic measure,
[01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:09.200]   we talked about blood glucose levels.
[01:23:09.200 --> 01:23:12.580]   A lot of people will say,
[01:23:12.580 --> 01:23:14.760]   again, you want that to be something like
[01:23:14.760 --> 01:23:17.460]   between 80 and 90 milligrams per deciliter
[01:23:17.460 --> 01:23:18.560]   is a blood glucose level.
[01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:20.740]   And you can go look at the cutoff points
[01:23:20.740 --> 01:23:23.620]   for what determines to be pre-diabetic
[01:23:23.620 --> 01:23:25.160]   and type two diabetic, et cetera.
[01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:26.720]   What I can actually recommend,
[01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:28.880]   this is, there's a little bit of science here actually
[01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:29.720]   that I'll talk you through,
[01:23:29.720 --> 01:23:31.840]   but a lot of this is my personal preference.
[01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:35.920]   I generally want people to be at 85 or lower.
[01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:37.100]   And that's because of a couple of things.
[01:23:37.100 --> 01:23:39.440]   Number one, there's actually some papers
[01:23:39.440 --> 01:23:44.440]   that showed every single point increase above 85
[01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:48.300]   increases your likelihood of developing type two diabetes
[01:23:48.300 --> 01:23:50.600]   by about 6%.
[01:23:50.600 --> 01:23:51.440]   Okay, great.
[01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:53.360]   So technically, while maybe 90 or 95
[01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:58.240]   or even up to 100 are in the quote unquote normative values,
[01:23:58.240 --> 01:23:59.640]   that's one clue.
[01:23:59.640 --> 01:24:01.680]   Again, it's not definitive by itself.
[01:24:01.680 --> 01:24:03.080]   It doesn't mean anything.
[01:24:03.080 --> 01:24:06.480]   You need to really pay attention to what increasing
[01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:09.200]   by 6% actually means,
[01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:11.640]   but it's a data point where I'm looking at.
[01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:13.800]   If I actually then see symptomology
[01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:15.640]   and we run you through maybe some questionnaires,
[01:24:15.640 --> 01:24:17.080]   ask how you're feeling throughout the day,
[01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:19.240]   and we see uncontrolled energy bouts.
[01:24:19.240 --> 01:24:20.120]   So you're a lot of energy,
[01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:22.800]   then you get really, really tired and swings.
[01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:24.680]   Okay, another data point.
[01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:26.900]   All right, and we may patch a few of these things together.
[01:24:26.900 --> 01:24:28.620]   That may give me some clues.
[01:24:29.880 --> 01:24:33.440]   That being said, again, a lot of this rhetoric
[01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:35.500]   is used to then scare people off of carbohydrates.
[01:24:35.500 --> 01:24:37.320]   And that is, I wanna be as clear as possible.
[01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:42.320]   That is not, not truly the only thing
[01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:43.840]   people should care about, right?
[01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:45.360]   It can be a thing.
[01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:46.680]   It can also be unrelated.
[01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:48.400]   There are reasons you could have
[01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:50.440]   blood glucose concentrations at this level
[01:24:50.440 --> 01:24:52.500]   or energy swings that are unrelated
[01:24:52.500 --> 01:24:54.640]   to carbohydrate ingestion at all.
[01:24:54.640 --> 01:24:57.780]   All right, so one test you can either run.
[01:24:57.780 --> 01:24:58.620]   In addition to that,
[01:24:58.620 --> 01:24:59.840]   if you're gonna get blood glucose measured,
[01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:01.980]   you can look at some markers we talked about earlier,
[01:25:01.980 --> 01:25:03.920]   which are AST and ALT.
[01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:06.160]   We talked about how you can kind of look
[01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:08.720]   at that AST to ALT ratio before.
[01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:09.780]   You can actually do the inverse,
[01:25:09.780 --> 01:25:12.280]   which is look at ALT and AST.
[01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:13.580]   The kind of normative value there
[01:25:13.580 --> 01:25:15.340]   you're gonna look at is like 0.8.
[01:25:15.340 --> 01:25:17.360]   I actually like to see it lower than that.
[01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:19.680]   And that alone has been actually associated
[01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:21.820]   with blood glucose dysregulation.
[01:25:21.820 --> 01:25:24.160]   And so if you see multiple of these signs,
[01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:26.560]   again, we're looking for patterns and patterns and patterns
[01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:29.640]   in both, in our case, biomark,
[01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:31.440]   symptomology, and performance.
[01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:34.480]   And now if all three of those things are lining up,
[01:25:34.480 --> 01:25:35.680]   you may have an issue.
[01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:39.920]   So performance-wise, a couple of little tests you can run.
[01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:42.600]   Ideally, you have some sort of standard workout you do.
[01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:44.960]   Oh, and hopefully it's pretty objective.
[01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:48.280]   So in other words, like I run the same 15-minute loop
[01:25:48.280 --> 01:25:49.800]   every morning for my cardio.
[01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:50.840]   Oh, okay, great.
[01:25:50.840 --> 01:25:53.100]   How long does it take you to run that loop?
[01:25:53.100 --> 01:25:54.200]   Like you could pick whatever distance.
[01:25:54.200 --> 01:25:55.520]   It doesn't really matter.
[01:25:55.520 --> 01:25:58.360]   What's your heart rate during that thing?
[01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:00.480]   And then what's your perceived exertion?
[01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:04.240]   Now, you should be able to do that fasted
[01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:07.280]   with very little drop in performance.
[01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:10.120]   If you can do that, then that tells me you're fairly good
[01:26:10.120 --> 01:26:12.700]   at using fat as a fuel source.
[01:26:12.700 --> 01:26:16.260]   If, however, the one day you go to do your standard workout
[01:26:16.260 --> 01:26:20.580]   and you feel awful fasting, that may be another clue
[01:26:20.580 --> 01:26:24.100]   that perhaps you're not very good at dialing in that system.
[01:26:24.100 --> 01:26:26.000]   If your recovery afterwards,
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.800]   in terms of heart rate recovery, is very long,
[01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:32.840]   that may be another clue that you have a poor utilization
[01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:34.320]   of fat as a fuel source.
[01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:36.520]   The inverse can also be true.
[01:26:36.520 --> 01:26:38.600]   So if I give you something in the neighborhood
[01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:42.360]   of like 50 or so grams of carbohydrate,
[01:26:42.360 --> 01:26:45.120]   and 30 minutes later, your face is falling off the table,
[01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:47.400]   that's a good sign that you're in the opposite.
[01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:49.360]   You're actually very, very, very poor
[01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:50.840]   at utilizing carbohydrate as a fuel.
[01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:54.400]   And the reason I bring that up is that is equally a problem.
[01:26:54.400 --> 01:26:57.880]   We send, we hear people a lot make comments like,
[01:26:57.880 --> 01:26:59.600]   "Man, I have to stay away from carbs.
[01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:01.780]   "I crash really hard if I do them."
[01:27:01.780 --> 01:27:05.520]   That has, what that actually means is you're very poor
[01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:07.720]   at utilizing carbohydrates as fuel.
[01:27:07.720 --> 01:27:10.640]   You're getting a, your sensitivity is way off.
[01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:12.920]   We should be able to have carbohydrate
[01:27:12.920 --> 01:27:15.240]   at a reasonable dosage, 50 grams,
[01:27:15.240 --> 01:27:17.660]   and not fall asleep 30 minutes later
[01:27:17.660 --> 01:27:19.020]   or have to run to caffeine.
[01:27:19.020 --> 01:27:21.640]   So that is a sign, in our opinion,
[01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:25.040]   this is again now just my practical brain telling you,
[01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:28.360]   is that's a sign of dysfunction.
[01:27:28.360 --> 01:27:30.180]   We should be able to have plenty of carbohydrates
[01:27:30.180 --> 01:27:31.960]   through the day if we choose to, if we want to,
[01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:33.700]   for any reason.
[01:27:33.700 --> 01:27:37.120]   Now, of course, if you were to throw 150 or 200 grams
[01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:39.260]   of carbohydrate in your belly,
[01:27:39.260 --> 01:27:42.240]   you're probably gonna take a little bit of an energy hit
[01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:43.680]   after that, but we should be able
[01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:45.800]   to have a reasonable dosage and not, you know,
[01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:47.360]   have to fall asleep afterwards.
[01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:51.440]   - What is one way that people can enhance their,
[01:27:51.440 --> 01:27:55.720]   utilization of carbohydrates for exercise?
[01:27:55.720 --> 01:27:58.200]   The reason I ask is I think I fall into that category.
[01:27:58.200 --> 01:27:59.040]   - Yep.
[01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:02.360]   - I do consume some complex carbohydrates
[01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:05.560]   and fruit post resistance training.
[01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:08.360]   And that tends to be when I'm hungriest for them.
[01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:11.000]   But typically, unless I'm,
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:12.840]   I've just done some resistance training,
[01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:17.280]   I keep most of my daytime meals relatively low carbohydrate.
[01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:20.460]   And then in the evening I prefer slightly less protein
[01:28:20.460 --> 01:28:23.360]   and more carbohydrate because it has this effect
[01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:26.800]   of sedating me a little bit and I sleep well.
[01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:29.920]   And I know this runs against what everyone was taught,
[01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:32.160]   which is to not eat carbohydrates late in the day,
[01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:35.000]   but I like it because then I tend to wake up in the morning
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:36.760]   with, at least as far as I can tell,
[01:28:36.760 --> 01:28:39.520]   my glycogen stores not necessarily topped off,
[01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:41.640]   but certainly filled.
[01:28:41.640 --> 01:28:45.400]   And I'm able to train fasted in the morning.
[01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:49.400]   And my favorite pre-workout consists of water
[01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:51.260]   and caffeine and electrolytes,
[01:28:51.260 --> 01:28:53.140]   and maybe some supplementation as well.
[01:28:53.140 --> 01:28:55.260]   But I love training fasted.
[01:28:55.260 --> 01:28:57.260]   - So there's actually a number of things.
[01:28:57.260 --> 01:29:00.040]   One little sneaky thing you threw in there
[01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:01.640]   is actually the use of caffeine.
[01:29:01.640 --> 01:29:02.580]   So that's another sign.
[01:29:02.580 --> 01:29:05.100]   If you have to have caffeine to do your fasted training,
[01:29:05.100 --> 01:29:06.020]   that's generally another sign
[01:29:06.020 --> 01:29:07.640]   you're not very good at using fuel.
[01:29:07.640 --> 01:29:11.440]   - So I use caffeine prior to resistance training workouts.
[01:29:11.440 --> 01:29:13.660]   Generally, I don't need it
[01:29:13.660 --> 01:29:16.400]   for any kind of cardiovascular training.
[01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:20.180]   Yeah, and when I say that, it doesn't mean it's bad.
[01:29:20.180 --> 01:29:21.880]   It's just like another clue that's like,
[01:29:21.880 --> 01:29:23.980]   okay, you should be able to do this
[01:29:23.980 --> 01:29:26.160]   without having to have caffeine to execute it.
[01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:29.160]   Now, using caffeine to get a better result
[01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:31.480]   is sort of different as an ergogenic aid.
[01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:35.560]   We actually use a lot of high carbohydrate meals
[01:29:35.560 --> 01:29:36.380]   at the end of the day,
[01:29:36.380 --> 01:29:38.600]   a lot of the times for athletes who are cutting weight
[01:29:38.600 --> 01:29:39.440]   or trying to reduce weight.
[01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:42.180]   So it is a fantastic way to handle a lot of things.
[01:29:42.180 --> 01:29:45.160]   And that idea that if you eat carbs late at night,
[01:29:45.160 --> 01:29:46.080]   that'll increase fat.
[01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:50.960]   So like that all is so old and so well destroyed,
[01:29:50.960 --> 01:29:53.760]   scientifically, that's not a concern.
[01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:55.240]   There's just so much data showing.
[01:29:55.240 --> 01:29:59.480]   In fact, there's so much data on like eating timing
[01:29:59.480 --> 01:30:02.000]   is generally poorly understood
[01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:03.600]   about when you can eat and what you can't eat.
[01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:06.460]   Eating in the morning versus eating at night,
[01:30:06.460 --> 01:30:08.440]   like a lot of what we've heard in there is tough.
[01:30:08.440 --> 01:30:11.800]   And maybe we just save that for sort of another day
[01:30:11.800 --> 01:30:13.740]   'cause we're gonna get really far down in the spot
[01:30:13.740 --> 01:30:15.240]   or we can dive into it.
[01:30:15.240 --> 01:30:16.880]   - Yes, I think our plan is to cover that
[01:30:16.880 --> 01:30:21.040]   in an episode on nutrition, which is in this series.
[01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:24.120]   The only thing that I would add to it is,
[01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:27.220]   when you hear about ingesting carbohydrate late at night,
[01:30:27.220 --> 01:30:29.320]   I should just say that at least in my case,
[01:30:29.320 --> 01:30:31.280]   I'm eating the majority of my carbohydrate
[01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:35.120]   unless I trained, resistance trained early in the day
[01:30:35.120 --> 01:30:37.520]   in which case I post resistance training
[01:30:37.520 --> 01:30:40.840]   in the last meal of the day.
[01:30:40.840 --> 01:30:42.360]   But for me, that's not really late at night.
[01:30:42.360 --> 01:30:46.000]   That last meal is somewhere between 6.30 and 7.30 p.m.
[01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.240]   - So it's three or so hours or something like that before-
[01:30:48.240 --> 01:30:50.240]   - I sleep around 10, 10.30 or so.
[01:30:50.240 --> 01:30:53.440]   So it's not, you know, midnight bowls of pasta.
[01:30:53.440 --> 01:30:56.920]   I've done that too, but typically it's not.
[01:30:56.920 --> 01:31:00.640]   So I think that people will be very interested,
[01:31:00.640 --> 01:31:04.360]   myself included, in how meal timing relates to all of this.
[01:31:04.360 --> 01:31:06.620]   But yeah, let's-
[01:31:06.620 --> 01:31:09.120]   - So how do you improve fat utilization?
[01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:10.480]   How do you improve carbohydrate utilization?
[01:31:10.480 --> 01:31:12.840]   Let's hammer both out really quickly.
[01:31:12.840 --> 01:31:17.320]   Enhancing fat utilization is as simple
[01:31:17.320 --> 01:31:19.640]   as doing a little bit of work
[01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:23.700]   in a either pre-fat ingested state.
[01:31:23.700 --> 01:31:26.520]   So anytime you ingest a nutrient prior to training,
[01:31:26.520 --> 01:31:29.920]   you're going to bias towards that nutrient, right?
[01:31:29.920 --> 01:31:31.860]   Which is almost what we were talking about earlier.
[01:31:31.860 --> 01:31:34.780]   So if you want to guarantee you burn more fat,
[01:31:34.780 --> 01:31:36.560]   eat more fat prior to a workout.
[01:31:36.560 --> 01:31:38.240]   Now you're not going to lose fat,
[01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:39.840]   but what you're effectively signaling
[01:31:39.840 --> 01:31:42.920]   is we have an overabundance of this fuel,
[01:31:42.920 --> 01:31:46.000]   preferentially target this fuel.
[01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:47.540]   Now the downside is that may actually
[01:31:47.540 --> 01:31:49.600]   hinder your performance.
[01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:51.440]   That's typically only a concern for people
[01:31:51.440 --> 01:31:53.220]   at a very high level.
[01:31:53.220 --> 01:31:56.180]   Fat is a slower fuel source.
[01:31:56.180 --> 01:31:57.940]   So if you're relying more upon that,
[01:31:57.940 --> 01:32:00.520]   your top end is going to come down a little bit.
[01:32:00.520 --> 01:32:02.640]   And so you wouldn't want to use that strategy
[01:32:02.640 --> 01:32:06.160]   prior to race if it is a carbohydrate-dependent race.
[01:32:06.160 --> 01:32:07.880]   All right.
[01:32:07.880 --> 01:32:09.440]   And in fact, we actually see long-term adaptations
[01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:10.280]   that would suggest that.
[01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:12.760]   So the enzymes responsible for carbohydrate metabolism
[01:32:12.760 --> 01:32:14.200]   will downregulate.
[01:32:14.200 --> 01:32:16.200]   And so you get worse at that.
[01:32:16.200 --> 01:32:18.200]   So not a great strategy there.
[01:32:18.200 --> 01:32:19.820]   Carbohydrate would be the opposite, right?
[01:32:19.820 --> 01:32:22.000]   So if you have carbohydrate prior to exercise,
[01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.080]   you're going to bias more towards that.
[01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:26.560]   So a handful of things you can do.
[01:32:26.560 --> 01:32:31.560]   If your total caloric intake is simply managed,
[01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:33.760]   that's going to take care of a lot of these problems.
[01:32:33.760 --> 01:32:36.260]   An appropriate eating strategy,
[01:32:36.260 --> 01:32:38.700]   so the types of food, the combinations of food,
[01:32:38.980 --> 01:32:42.180]   all of those things are going to make
[01:32:42.180 --> 01:32:46.060]   your post-carbohydrate ingestion bonk.
[01:32:46.060 --> 01:32:47.220]   A lot of those things can go away.
[01:32:47.220 --> 01:32:48.680]   So there's a little bit of physiology
[01:32:48.680 --> 01:32:51.220]   that has to be corrected for.
[01:32:51.220 --> 01:32:52.820]   So it's a little bit,
[01:32:52.820 --> 01:32:54.500]   in one hand, you can go very deep here, right?
[01:32:54.500 --> 01:32:56.380]   So the real answer of how we would do this
[01:32:56.380 --> 01:32:57.800]   is if we see a scenario like that,
[01:32:57.800 --> 01:32:59.980]   we're going to do a whole set of analyses.
[01:32:59.980 --> 01:33:01.220]   We're going to go full labs, right?
[01:33:01.220 --> 01:33:05.660]   Probably extensive blood panel, urine, saliva, stool even.
[01:33:05.660 --> 01:33:06.700]   And we're going to figure out
[01:33:06.700 --> 01:33:09.500]   where is that glucose dysregulation coming from?
[01:33:09.500 --> 01:33:10.540]   So a lot of people think like,
[01:33:10.540 --> 01:33:12.020]   "Oh, it's a metabolism issue."
[01:33:12.020 --> 01:33:13.220]   It might be.
[01:33:13.220 --> 01:33:15.540]   It also might just be a flag
[01:33:15.540 --> 01:33:17.060]   that something else is happening in the body.
[01:33:17.060 --> 01:33:18.660]   So we're going to actually work backwards a lot
[01:33:18.660 --> 01:33:21.720]   to try to figure out exactly why that's occurring.
[01:33:21.720 --> 01:33:23.620]   It may be as simple as,
[01:33:23.620 --> 01:33:26.420]   "Oh, you're eating a lot of your carbohydrates
[01:33:26.420 --> 01:33:28.700]   "without any fiber or protein."
[01:33:28.700 --> 01:33:29.860]   And we know that that's important
[01:33:29.860 --> 01:33:32.820]   because those will actually blunt the glycemic index,
[01:33:32.820 --> 01:33:34.060]   like the rise in blood glucose.
[01:33:34.060 --> 01:33:35.260]   So it could be a simple thing of just like,
[01:33:35.260 --> 01:33:37.420]   "Oh, your combination of food is doing it."
[01:33:37.420 --> 01:33:38.820]   It's not the total amount.
[01:33:38.820 --> 01:33:39.820]   It may be something, again,
[01:33:39.820 --> 01:33:42.160]   more endogenous to the actual system.
[01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:46.260]   It could be a heart rate issue.
[01:33:46.260 --> 01:33:47.900]   It could be a breathing issue.
[01:33:47.900 --> 01:33:49.020]   There could be a number of things.
[01:33:49.020 --> 01:33:51.540]   So the way to get better at it is to simply train it.
[01:33:51.540 --> 01:33:53.660]   And specificity is king here.
[01:33:53.660 --> 01:33:55.180]   So if you want to get better
[01:33:55.180 --> 01:33:59.340]   at managing your blood glucose throughout the day
[01:33:59.340 --> 01:34:00.860]   so that you're not feeling those things,
[01:34:00.860 --> 01:34:02.200]   it could be a fuel issue,
[01:34:02.200 --> 01:34:03.820]   but it could be a number of other things.
[01:34:03.820 --> 01:34:05.540]   It's just hard to go into all of them
[01:34:05.540 --> 01:34:07.420]   within our time constraint.
[01:34:07.420 --> 01:34:10.120]   So the practical tool that I would say here is
[01:34:10.120 --> 01:34:12.460]   if you want to get better at managing energy
[01:34:12.460 --> 01:34:13.300]   throughout the day,
[01:34:13.300 --> 01:34:16.140]   make sure that number one, your protein is stabilized.
[01:34:16.140 --> 01:34:19.140]   Make sure, number two, you're ingesting your food
[01:34:19.140 --> 01:34:20.380]   in the right combinations,
[01:34:20.380 --> 01:34:24.980]   ideally with some fiber or some protein or both.
[01:34:24.980 --> 01:34:28.360]   That alone will help stabilize a lot of the problems.
[01:34:28.360 --> 01:34:30.020]   Then you need to train at a high intensity.
[01:34:30.020 --> 01:34:32.420]   You want to get better at using carbohydrates as a fuel.
[01:34:32.420 --> 01:34:33.500]   Train at a higher intensity
[01:34:33.500 --> 01:34:36.500]   and have carbohydrates right before the workout.
[01:34:36.500 --> 01:34:41.320]   We'll do that a lot if we see folks who are,
[01:34:41.320 --> 01:34:43.140]   I kind of walked you through the test of identifying
[01:34:43.140 --> 01:34:45.120]   if you're not very good at using fat as a fuel.
[01:34:45.120 --> 01:34:48.260]   The test for not being good at using carbohydrate
[01:34:48.260 --> 01:34:51.260]   as a fuel is both that eating test I talked about,
[01:34:51.260 --> 01:34:52.660]   as well as performance.
[01:34:52.660 --> 01:34:54.860]   If you're a very, very, very slow starter,
[01:34:54.860 --> 01:34:56.720]   it's just like really hard to get going,
[01:34:56.720 --> 01:34:59.860]   that generally indicates you might be in a situation
[01:34:59.860 --> 01:35:01.940]   where you're not very good at using carbohydrates as fuel.
[01:35:01.940 --> 01:35:03.460]   So we're going to practice that.
[01:35:03.460 --> 01:35:06.060]   We're going to have a pre-carpa hydrate,
[01:35:06.060 --> 01:35:07.260]   pre-exercise carbohydrate meal,
[01:35:07.260 --> 01:35:09.060]   then we're going to do higher intensity stuff.
[01:35:09.060 --> 01:35:10.260]   Not to the point of making you sick
[01:35:10.260 --> 01:35:11.500]   and digestive issues, all that stuff.
[01:35:11.500 --> 01:35:13.660]   But we want to get better at using carbohydrates
[01:35:13.660 --> 01:35:15.580]   as a fuel faster.
[01:35:15.580 --> 01:35:17.580]   If you want to get better at doing the opposite,
[01:35:17.580 --> 01:35:18.660]   then you do that opposite strategy.
[01:35:18.660 --> 01:35:21.220]   Either, again, using fat prior to the workout,
[01:35:21.220 --> 01:35:24.140]   knowing your peak performance
[01:35:24.140 --> 01:35:25.680]   is going to go down a little bit,
[01:35:25.680 --> 01:35:28.300]   but you're investing in adaptation, right?
[01:35:28.300 --> 01:35:29.540]   So it's not about that workout.
[01:35:29.540 --> 01:35:32.540]   It's about what's going to happen six, eight, 10 weeks from now.
[01:35:32.540 --> 01:35:34.120]   Investment is what you want to think about.
[01:35:34.120 --> 01:35:37.340]   Or you could bring in some fasted training.
[01:35:37.340 --> 01:35:38.900]   And so I want to really make sure I clarify
[01:35:38.900 --> 01:35:40.060]   when we were talking about it earlier,
[01:35:40.060 --> 01:35:42.720]   I'm not at all against fasted training.
[01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:44.620]   It's not, it works.
[01:35:44.620 --> 01:35:47.940]   It just isn't required for fat loss.
[01:35:47.940 --> 01:35:51.420]   It isn't required for fat adaptation.
[01:35:51.420 --> 01:35:54.260]   It is a great option though, if you want.
[01:35:54.260 --> 01:35:56.200]   What I was hoping to do with that conversation,
[01:35:56.200 --> 01:35:57.560]   and maybe I didn't articulate that well,
[01:35:57.560 --> 01:36:01.080]   is to not restrict people, but is to open you up.
[01:36:01.080 --> 01:36:02.840]   And to let you say, you have a lot of options.
[01:36:02.840 --> 01:36:06.320]   If you like to do fasted cardio, amazing, it is great.
[01:36:06.320 --> 01:36:08.260]   If you hate it, you don't have to.
[01:36:08.260 --> 01:36:10.320]   You can reach the same performance goals,
[01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:13.160]   the same physique goals without ever doing it.
[01:36:13.160 --> 01:36:16.200]   If you love long duration steady state stuff, it is great.
[01:36:16.200 --> 01:36:19.040]   If you hate it, there are other options,
[01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:20.000]   higher intensity stuff.
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:21.980]   Again, if we're just talking about fat loss.
[01:36:21.980 --> 01:36:25.320]   So I hope now that that's a little clearer
[01:36:25.320 --> 01:36:27.180]   in terms of the same thing with nutrition.
[01:36:27.180 --> 01:36:29.200]   If you like higher carb, great.
[01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:30.880]   If you like lower carb, these are all great.
[01:36:30.880 --> 01:36:33.880]   You have options and you don't have to fret so much over,
[01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:36.000]   oh my gosh, I have to do this thing a certain way.
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:37.380]   And I absolutely hate it.
[01:36:37.380 --> 01:36:38.320]   You don't have to worry about it.
[01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:41.620]   Hit those concepts and you'll be fine.
[01:36:41.620 --> 01:36:44.940]   - A few minutes ago, you mentioned that
[01:36:44.940 --> 01:36:48.120]   if we ingest a given macronutrient fat,
[01:36:48.120 --> 01:36:51.320]   then the body will preferentially use that fuel source.
[01:36:51.320 --> 01:36:55.200]   If you ingest carbohydrate, we'll use that fuel source.
[01:36:56.280 --> 01:36:58.820]   Is it always the case that the body uses
[01:36:58.820 --> 01:37:02.880]   the ingested macronutrient prior to using glycogen?
[01:37:02.880 --> 01:37:04.900]   I have to imagine it's using both.
[01:37:04.900 --> 01:37:07.380]   I mean, if I were to have some carbohydrate
[01:37:07.380 --> 01:37:10.800]   before doing any kind of training,
[01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:13.280]   the muscles still burn glycogen, right?
[01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:15.200]   Or do they have some way to register
[01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:17.500]   the amount of circulating carbohydrate
[01:37:17.500 --> 01:37:19.620]   that would allow or available carbohydrate
[01:37:19.620 --> 01:37:21.180]   in the form of food stuffs
[01:37:22.940 --> 01:37:26.260]   that would allow them to not tap into their own
[01:37:26.260 --> 01:37:28.260]   muscle fiber stores of glycogen?
[01:37:28.260 --> 01:37:30.620]   - All right, so the way we derive energy
[01:37:30.620 --> 01:37:33.540]   for exercise or basic maintenance,
[01:37:33.540 --> 01:37:34.980]   a little bit about cellular physiology.
[01:37:34.980 --> 01:37:36.880]   So you've got a couple of organelle and structures
[01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:37.740]   that we need to pay attention to.
[01:37:37.740 --> 01:37:40.380]   The first one is the nucleus, that's whole-g DNA.
[01:37:40.380 --> 01:37:42.260]   The second one is the mitochondria.
[01:37:42.260 --> 01:37:43.240]   And then everything outside of that,
[01:37:43.240 --> 01:37:44.460]   you've got all these other organelle
[01:37:44.460 --> 01:37:46.280]   that do a bunch of things like ribosomes
[01:37:46.280 --> 01:37:48.420]   or protein synthesis, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:37:48.420 --> 01:37:52.780]   All right, now, when you wanna produce energy for exercise,
[01:37:53.700 --> 01:37:55.980]   anytime you hear the word anaerobic,
[01:37:55.980 --> 01:37:57.860]   you automatically understand
[01:37:57.860 --> 01:38:00.420]   what you're meaning without oxygen.
[01:38:00.420 --> 01:38:01.300]   All right, great.
[01:38:01.300 --> 01:38:04.260]   That all happens in the cytoplasm.
[01:38:04.260 --> 01:38:06.460]   The cytoplasm is that space
[01:38:06.460 --> 01:38:09.660]   that is not the mitochondria, not the nucleus.
[01:38:09.660 --> 01:38:11.860]   So it's the space in between everything else.
[01:38:11.860 --> 01:38:14.780]   This is like jelly-like substance that sounds there.
[01:38:14.780 --> 01:38:17.100]   So anaerobic metabolism happens there.
[01:38:17.100 --> 01:38:22.100]   Every single aerobic metabolic process happens there.
[01:38:22.100 --> 01:38:24.140]   All right, why is that important?
[01:38:24.140 --> 01:38:26.220]   If I go to create cellular energy
[01:38:26.220 --> 01:38:27.980]   and I need it the fastest possible,
[01:38:27.980 --> 01:38:29.820]   I'm going to go for phosphocreatine
[01:38:29.820 --> 01:38:32.220]   because it is stored directly in the cytoplasm.
[01:38:32.220 --> 01:38:34.260]   The stoichiometry is one-to-one there,
[01:38:34.260 --> 01:38:36.980]   which means for every mole of phosphocreatine I burn,
[01:38:36.980 --> 01:38:38.900]   I can create one ATP.
[01:38:38.900 --> 01:38:39.740]   It's one-to-one.
[01:38:39.740 --> 01:38:42.420]   It is incredibly fast, but it is very limited
[01:38:42.420 --> 01:38:43.260]   because think about it,
[01:38:43.260 --> 01:38:45.820]   how much of that could I possibly store
[01:38:45.820 --> 01:38:47.820]   in the small size of the cell?
[01:38:47.820 --> 01:38:48.860]   That's it.
[01:38:48.860 --> 01:38:50.100]   If I go to create cellular energy
[01:38:50.100 --> 01:38:52.100]   and I need it the fastest possible,
[01:38:52.100 --> 01:38:53.660]   I can create one ATP.
[01:38:53.660 --> 01:38:55.580]   So that's it.
[01:38:55.580 --> 01:38:57.740]   If I need energy past that point,
[01:38:57.740 --> 01:39:00.340]   now I'll start using muscle glycogen
[01:39:00.340 --> 01:39:03.500]   because that is also stored in the cytoplasm.
[01:39:03.500 --> 01:39:04.860]   So it is right there.
[01:39:04.860 --> 01:39:06.420]   The stoichiometry is not one-to-one.
[01:39:06.420 --> 01:39:09.260]   It's a little bit higher, probably like four-to-one.
[01:39:09.260 --> 01:39:11.660]   So for every molecule of glycogen you burn,
[01:39:11.660 --> 01:39:14.100]   you're going to get something like four-ish,
[01:39:14.100 --> 01:39:17.140]   some small number of ATP out of that, which is great.
[01:39:17.140 --> 01:39:19.740]   But again, you're running into a storage problem.
[01:39:19.740 --> 01:39:22.180]   Very, very fast, much more effective than phosphocreatine,
[01:39:22.180 --> 01:39:23.980]   but so there.
[01:39:23.980 --> 01:39:28.380]   If I then want to metabolize any form of fat,
[01:39:28.380 --> 01:39:32.060]   or if I want to complete the metabolization of carbohydrates,
[01:39:32.060 --> 01:39:35.100]   I have to start transferring into the mitochondria.
[01:39:35.100 --> 01:39:38.260]   Now I start getting whole hosts of ATP.
[01:39:38.260 --> 01:39:40.260]   If you were to fully run through this thing,
[01:39:40.260 --> 01:39:41.980]   which I'll talk about in a second,
[01:39:41.980 --> 01:39:44.580]   called the TCA cycle or Krebs cycle,
[01:39:44.580 --> 01:39:48.060]   you'll get now something like 28 or 30 or 35,
[01:39:48.060 --> 01:39:50.620]   kind of depending, ATP per.
[01:39:50.620 --> 01:39:54.300]   So the energetic output is much higher.
[01:39:54.300 --> 01:39:55.740]   Okay, so here's exactly what happens,
[01:39:55.740 --> 01:39:56.900]   and I'm going to walk you through this
[01:39:56.900 --> 01:39:58.260]   in the form of carbohydrate,
[01:39:58.260 --> 01:40:02.340]   and then I'll come backwards and go through fat.
[01:40:02.340 --> 01:40:04.900]   So remember, carbohydrate,
[01:40:04.900 --> 01:40:07.540]   it is one carbon molecule that has been hydrated.
[01:40:07.540 --> 01:40:09.700]   So it is one-to-one.
[01:40:09.700 --> 01:40:13.700]   So the actual chemistry here, it is CH2O.
[01:40:16.700 --> 01:40:19.380]   One carbon, 2H10.
[01:40:19.380 --> 01:40:22.040]   Glucose is a six-carbon chain.
[01:40:22.040 --> 01:40:26.400]   So the chemistry here is C6H12O6.
[01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:28.480]   Six carbons, six waters.
[01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:30.460]   Very simple, that's a carbohydrate.
[01:40:30.460 --> 01:40:32.240]   All right, so you can imagine,
[01:40:32.240 --> 01:40:34.140]   if you're watching on the video here,
[01:40:34.140 --> 01:40:35.580]   you'll see my fingers going nuts.
[01:40:35.580 --> 01:40:36.940]   I'll try to make sure I explain it to you all,
[01:40:36.940 --> 01:40:38.300]   just listening in an easy fashion.
[01:40:38.300 --> 01:40:40.460]   So you've got this chain of six carbons
[01:40:40.460 --> 01:40:41.500]   that is in front of you,
[01:40:41.500 --> 01:40:43.140]   and the very first step to metabolism
[01:40:43.140 --> 01:40:45.460]   is you snap that thing in half, right?
[01:40:45.460 --> 01:40:48.460]   So you break it into two separate three carbon chains.
[01:40:48.460 --> 01:40:50.940]   Now, in doing that, you've got a little bit of energy
[01:40:50.940 --> 01:40:52.420]   'cause you broke that one bond,
[01:40:52.420 --> 01:40:53.860]   but not a tremendous amount.
[01:40:53.860 --> 01:40:56.020]   This is called glycolysis.
[01:40:56.020 --> 01:40:57.780]   So lysis being the split,
[01:40:57.780 --> 01:41:02.020]   and you know, you split glycogen up.
[01:41:02.020 --> 01:41:04.100]   Got a little bit of energy of that.
[01:41:04.100 --> 01:41:06.880]   All right, you formed this three-carbon chain
[01:41:06.880 --> 01:41:08.580]   called pyruvate, or pyruvic acid.
[01:41:08.580 --> 01:41:11.380]   Okay, there's differences there, but don't kill me.
[01:41:11.380 --> 01:41:12.900]   General audience, friends, all right?
[01:41:12.900 --> 01:41:16.040]   I gotta communicate this to everybody.
[01:41:16.040 --> 01:41:17.260]   So you got a little bit of that.
[01:41:17.260 --> 01:41:19.020]   Now, you can't do much past that
[01:41:19.020 --> 01:41:21.260]   besides rip one more carbon
[01:41:21.260 --> 01:41:23.140]   off of each of those three-carbon chains.
[01:41:23.140 --> 01:41:25.220]   So I've got two three-carbon chains.
[01:41:25.220 --> 01:41:27.140]   I gotta be careful how I do this with my fingers
[01:41:27.140 --> 01:41:29.140]   so I don't flip you off here in a second,
[01:41:29.140 --> 01:41:31.920]   but I burn one more off of each.
[01:41:31.920 --> 01:41:33.140]   I get a little bit of energy,
[01:41:33.140 --> 01:41:35.180]   and now that little two-carbon chain,
[01:41:35.180 --> 01:41:36.500]   I have two two-carbon chains,
[01:41:36.500 --> 01:41:38.420]   those are called acetyl-CoA.
[01:41:38.420 --> 01:41:39.980]   All right, amazing.
[01:41:39.980 --> 01:41:41.920]   I have now completed anaerobic glycolysis.
[01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:43.740]   I've got really nothing left I can do here.
[01:41:43.740 --> 01:41:44.800]   I made a little bit of ATP.
[01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:45.880]   Now, wait a minute.
[01:41:45.880 --> 01:41:51.540]   I have now freed two carbons.
[01:41:51.540 --> 01:41:52.880]   Because remember, I started with six,
[01:41:52.880 --> 01:41:53.720]   and I split them apart,
[01:41:53.720 --> 01:41:55.340]   but I had two three-carbon chains.
[01:41:55.340 --> 01:41:56.580]   I burned one each.
[01:41:56.580 --> 01:41:58.500]   I've got two free-floating carbons.
[01:41:58.500 --> 01:42:01.140]   I have to now do something with them.
[01:42:01.140 --> 01:42:04.500]   My body will not let me go through that last process
[01:42:04.500 --> 01:42:07.020]   unless I've got a plan for that free carbon,
[01:42:07.020 --> 01:42:09.380]   'cause I can't break it in half.
[01:42:09.380 --> 01:42:10.360]   Amazing.
[01:42:10.360 --> 01:42:11.860]   Here's what's going to happen.
[01:42:11.860 --> 01:42:14.760]   If I have those three-carbon molecules,
[01:42:14.760 --> 01:42:19.000]   and I don't have anywhere I can put that carbon,
[01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:23.020]   you're not going to go through that process.
[01:42:23.020 --> 01:42:24.220]   It's going to stop it.
[01:42:24.220 --> 01:42:27.540]   You're gonna start building up pyruvate.
[01:42:27.540 --> 01:42:31.720]   Now, at the same time, you're breaking ATP for fuel.
[01:42:31.720 --> 01:42:33.980]   That's called ATP hydrolysis.
[01:42:33.980 --> 01:42:35.660]   Right, you have water that comes in.
[01:42:35.660 --> 01:42:37.660]   You have adenosine and three-phosphates.
[01:42:37.660 --> 01:42:38.820]   That's why it's called ATP.
[01:42:38.820 --> 01:42:40.880]   Adenosine triphosphate, one, two, three.
[01:42:40.880 --> 01:42:43.840]   You break one of those phosphates off.
[01:42:43.840 --> 01:42:44.940]   There you go, there's your energy.
[01:42:44.940 --> 01:42:48.040]   So now you have a free-floating inorganic phosphate
[01:42:48.040 --> 01:42:51.440]   and an adenosine diphosphate, so two over there.
[01:42:51.440 --> 01:42:52.280]   Amazing.
[01:42:52.280 --> 01:42:56.760]   That actually results, because you use water for it,
[01:42:56.760 --> 01:42:59.160]   results in a free-floating hydrogen ion.
[01:42:59.160 --> 01:43:03.160]   Okay, you just have to trust me, hydrogen H2O.
[01:43:03.160 --> 01:43:07.220]   Any idea what a free-floating hydrogen is?
[01:43:08.440 --> 01:43:10.000]   - It's gonna--
[01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:10.840]   - That's acid.
[01:43:10.840 --> 01:43:12.800]   - Yeah, I was gonna say it's gonna increase acidity.
[01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:13.640]   - That's what acidity is.
[01:43:13.640 --> 01:43:14.800]   - For anyone that's ever measured pH,
[01:43:14.800 --> 01:43:17.320]   what you're really measuring is the amount of hydrogen.
[01:43:17.320 --> 01:43:19.800]   - Potential hydrogen, that's what pH is, right?
[01:43:19.800 --> 01:43:21.960]   100%, there's two definitions of pH,
[01:43:21.960 --> 01:43:23.120]   but you get it, that's one of the two.
[01:43:23.120 --> 01:43:27.600]   - So are you gonna tell me this is related to the burn?
[01:43:27.600 --> 01:43:29.460]   - We're gonna get close, right?
[01:43:29.460 --> 01:43:32.820]   So I've got a bunch of free-floating.
[01:43:32.820 --> 01:43:34.920]   You've got the phosphates, which are actually a problem,
[01:43:34.920 --> 01:43:37.720]   two, probably more of a problem than people realize,
[01:43:37.720 --> 01:43:39.000]   and that hydrogen.
[01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.960]   What are you going to do with that hydrogen?
[01:43:41.960 --> 01:43:43.880]   Well, one thing you can do is actually ship it over
[01:43:43.880 --> 01:43:46.380]   to pyruvate and bond it there.
[01:43:46.380 --> 01:43:48.040]   We have a special name for that little molecule
[01:43:48.040 --> 01:43:48.880]   when you have pyruvate
[01:43:48.880 --> 01:43:50.160]   and you have a hydrogen attached to it.
[01:43:50.160 --> 01:43:51.320]   Do you know what it's called?
[01:43:51.320 --> 01:43:54.440]   - Hydrogen peroxide?
[01:43:54.440 --> 01:43:55.260]   - Lactate.
[01:43:55.260 --> 01:44:00.440]   Lactate, lactic acid, this is that whole system, right?
[01:44:00.440 --> 01:44:01.960]   Again, I was skipping some steps,
[01:44:01.960 --> 01:44:03.280]   making a little bit of mistakes here,
[01:44:03.280 --> 01:44:05.800]   intentionally folks, just to make this assumed.
[01:44:05.800 --> 01:44:07.240]   So what happens when you start running
[01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:08.620]   a bunch of anaerobic glycolysis?
[01:44:08.620 --> 01:44:13.100]   You start seeing massive rises in lactate.
[01:44:13.100 --> 01:44:13.940]   Cool.
[01:44:13.940 --> 01:44:14.860]   - Not lactic acid.
[01:44:14.860 --> 01:44:15.960]   - Right, right?
[01:44:15.960 --> 01:44:20.280]   That's why we see associations
[01:44:20.280 --> 01:44:22.960]   between a lot of lactate and a lot of fatigue.
[01:44:22.960 --> 01:44:25.360]   But the lactate's actually not causing the fatigue.
[01:44:25.360 --> 01:44:26.900]   The lactate is actually sparing you
[01:44:26.900 --> 01:44:30.660]   from having a bunch of free-floating acid.
[01:44:30.660 --> 01:44:33.960]   It also can be then used directly back in the muscle
[01:44:33.960 --> 01:44:36.160]   because as soon as you bring in enough oxygen
[01:44:37.040 --> 01:44:38.940]   and you can take that hydrogen back off of it,
[01:44:38.940 --> 01:44:40.520]   you've now turned it right back into pyruvate
[01:44:40.520 --> 01:44:42.280]   and you can run it through this whole cycle
[01:44:42.280 --> 01:44:43.840]   as fuel that I'm about to do.
[01:44:43.840 --> 01:44:45.520]   You can actually actually ship it out of
[01:44:45.520 --> 01:44:47.400]   the exercising muscle and ship it into
[01:44:47.400 --> 01:44:50.000]   a non-exercising muscle and then go backwards
[01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:51.280]   and make glucose.
[01:44:51.280 --> 01:44:54.980]   - What actually liberates hydrogen from lactate?
[01:44:54.980 --> 01:44:56.040]   - Well, like chemically?
[01:44:56.040 --> 01:44:58.240]   - Yeah, so what liberates,
[01:44:58.240 --> 01:45:00.600]   well, what are the stimuli that can take hydrogen
[01:45:00.600 --> 01:45:05.040]   off the pyruvate and then, in other words,
[01:45:05.040 --> 01:45:07.400]   to reduce lactate and free up that hydrogen?
[01:45:07.400 --> 01:45:08.440]   - Oxygen availability.
[01:45:08.440 --> 01:45:11.720]   So, in fact, one of the major places
[01:45:11.720 --> 01:45:13.160]   that you ship hydrogen to,
[01:45:13.160 --> 01:45:14.800]   or one of the major places that you ship lactate to
[01:45:14.800 --> 01:45:16.400]   is your heart.
[01:45:16.400 --> 01:45:19.120]   Because it's what we call the ultimate sausage fiber,
[01:45:19.120 --> 01:45:22.680]   and it has a ton of freely available mitochondria,
[01:45:22.680 --> 01:45:24.760]   which have a ton of access to oxygen,
[01:45:24.760 --> 01:45:27.980]   so it can actually then go to it, form water,
[01:45:27.980 --> 01:45:30.320]   the H2O can be used to form water,
[01:45:30.320 --> 01:45:32.840]   and now we have a place to store the hydrogen.
[01:45:32.840 --> 01:45:33.680]   - Got it.
[01:45:33.680 --> 01:45:35.280]   - Right? Cool.
[01:45:35.280 --> 01:45:39.320]   So, as a result of anaerobic glycolysis,
[01:45:39.320 --> 01:45:41.180]   we have made a little bit of ATP.
[01:45:41.180 --> 01:45:43.480]   We've created a lot of waste,
[01:45:43.480 --> 01:45:47.280]   and we don't have anywhere to go with these end products.
[01:45:47.280 --> 01:45:50.820]   So, when you do anything of a higher intensity,
[01:45:50.820 --> 01:45:53.640]   and it says, "I need energy fast,"
[01:45:53.640 --> 01:45:55.240]   you're gonna go to this system first, right?
[01:45:55.240 --> 01:45:56.540]   Right past ATP.
[01:45:56.540 --> 01:45:58.360]   Because it is the fastest place to get energy,
[01:45:58.360 --> 01:45:59.300]   but you're not gonna get much of it,
[01:45:59.300 --> 01:46:02.640]   and you've gotta deal with the waste products.
[01:46:02.640 --> 01:46:03.840]   Bone.
[01:46:03.840 --> 01:46:06.000]   Right back to the beginning of our conversation.
[01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:07.640]   Endurance is about two things.
[01:46:07.640 --> 01:46:09.920]   Energy production and waste management.
[01:46:09.920 --> 01:46:11.760]   And we're fatigue buffering.
[01:46:11.760 --> 01:46:12.600]   This is it, right?
[01:46:12.600 --> 01:46:15.920]   How well can you handle the elevations in hydrogen,
[01:46:15.920 --> 01:46:17.320]   right, drop in pH,
[01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:20.200]   and then what are you gonna do with these products?
[01:46:20.200 --> 01:46:23.660]   If you want to fully metabolize a carbohydrate,
[01:46:23.660 --> 01:46:26.440]   you then have to do something with those pyruvates
[01:46:26.440 --> 01:46:27.880]   or those acetyl-CoAs,
[01:46:27.880 --> 01:46:30.260]   which are going to do, if oxygen is available,
[01:46:30.260 --> 01:46:31.280]   you will take those things
[01:46:31.280 --> 01:46:33.080]   and ship them into the mitochondria.
[01:46:33.080 --> 01:46:36.000]   They have to go through some cell walls
[01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:37.520]   and some other things like that,
[01:46:37.520 --> 01:46:39.740]   but they're going to get inside there.
[01:46:39.740 --> 01:46:40.720]   Once they're in there,
[01:46:40.720 --> 01:46:44.280]   that two carbon acetyl-CoA runs through this entire cycle
[01:46:44.280 --> 01:46:46.440]   that we call the Krebs cycle.
[01:46:46.440 --> 01:46:47.680]   And that's this really interesting place.
[01:46:47.680 --> 01:46:51.080]   That's where B6 and NMN people are,
[01:46:51.080 --> 01:46:52.820]   that's where that whole stuff starts to kick in.
[01:46:52.820 --> 01:46:55.660]   All your B vitamins basically run that entire circle.
[01:46:55.660 --> 01:46:57.200]   And you're gonna start off at the top.
[01:46:57.200 --> 01:46:59.400]   You have a bunch of fun stuff going on.
[01:46:59.400 --> 01:47:01.200]   But as a part of that circle,
[01:47:01.200 --> 01:47:03.360]   you're gonna pull off some of the hydrogen ions.
[01:47:03.360 --> 01:47:04.200]   You're gonna send these
[01:47:04.200 --> 01:47:05.600]   to what's called the electron transport chain.
[01:47:05.600 --> 01:47:08.040]   That's where you're gonna get a ton of ATP out of.
[01:47:08.040 --> 01:47:10.080]   And as a result, about halfway through the turn,
[01:47:10.080 --> 01:47:11.960]   you're gonna pull off one carbon.
[01:47:11.960 --> 01:47:13.360]   And about halfway through,
[01:47:13.360 --> 01:47:14.320]   almost the other way through the finish,
[01:47:14.320 --> 01:47:16.200]   you're gonna pull off the second carbon.
[01:47:16.200 --> 01:47:18.760]   So you're gonna take the second acetyl-CoA,
[01:47:18.760 --> 01:47:21.400]   run that entire thing same through as well.
[01:47:21.400 --> 01:47:22.880]   And so what we did is we started off
[01:47:22.880 --> 01:47:24.520]   with a six carbon glucose chain.
[01:47:24.520 --> 01:47:26.660]   We split it in half, we called those pyruvate.
[01:47:26.660 --> 01:47:27.520]   Made a little bit of energy
[01:47:27.520 --> 01:47:28.920]   'cause we broke that one bond
[01:47:28.920 --> 01:47:31.080]   of those two carbons that are in the middle,
[01:47:31.080 --> 01:47:31.920]   cool.
[01:47:31.920 --> 01:47:33.080]   Those two, three carbon molecules,
[01:47:33.080 --> 01:47:35.360]   we pulled one carbon off of each.
[01:47:35.360 --> 01:47:39.160]   We brought in, sorry, we moved those into the mitochondria.
[01:47:39.160 --> 01:47:40.000]   We brought one off.
[01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.880]   We took a breath, brought in some oxygen, bonded that.
[01:47:42.880 --> 01:47:45.440]   Brett took out two CO2 exhales.
[01:47:45.440 --> 01:47:48.540]   We ran the acetyl-CoA through the Krebs cycle.
[01:47:48.540 --> 01:47:52.840]   One, two carbons per turn coming out of CO2.
[01:47:52.840 --> 01:47:54.240]   So we had six carbons total
[01:47:54.240 --> 01:47:57.020]   and we started and we exited with zero carbons.
[01:47:57.020 --> 01:48:00.520]   Now we have fully metabolized a molecule of carbohydrate.
[01:48:01.080 --> 01:48:06.080]   That required an anaerobic start and an aerobic finish.
[01:48:06.080 --> 01:48:10.440]   If you don't have a lot of mitochondria,
[01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:13.080]   large mitochondria, high functioning mitochondria,
[01:48:13.080 --> 01:48:15.300]   you're going to limit your anaerobic performance
[01:48:15.300 --> 01:48:16.560]   because you're going to get,
[01:48:16.560 --> 01:48:19.800]   they're gonna run that door full very, very quickly.
[01:48:19.800 --> 01:48:20.720]   You can't go past it
[01:48:20.720 --> 01:48:23.820]   because hydrogen will build up way too fast.
[01:48:23.820 --> 01:48:25.000]   And one of the things that we know
[01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:30.000]   is both temperature and pH run enzyme function.
[01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:31.200]   So they're going to stop.
[01:48:31.200 --> 01:48:32.800]   You won't even be able to run through, in fact,
[01:48:32.800 --> 01:48:34.760]   that ATP hydrolysis phase.
[01:48:34.760 --> 01:48:37.240]   Even if I gave you a whole infinite supply of ATP,
[01:48:37.240 --> 01:48:39.160]   if I put enough acid in there, it would stop working
[01:48:39.160 --> 01:48:42.200]   because the ATPase enzyme needed to split,
[01:48:42.200 --> 01:48:44.640]   it won't be able to run in a highly acidic environment
[01:48:44.640 --> 01:48:46.080]   or a hot environment.
[01:48:46.080 --> 01:48:47.940]   - Yeah, at some point, perhaps today,
[01:48:47.940 --> 01:48:51.080]   perhaps in the future discussion,
[01:48:51.080 --> 01:48:52.800]   but still not too far from now,
[01:48:52.800 --> 01:48:56.960]   we could talk about the role of temperature in pyruvate
[01:48:56.960 --> 01:48:59.000]   in terms of its regulation muscle contraction.
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:03.040]   But I want to make sure I understood something correctly.
[01:49:03.040 --> 01:49:07.400]   You mentioned these two parallel fuel systems, right?
[01:49:07.400 --> 01:49:11.180]   One is essentially anaerobic, right?
[01:49:11.180 --> 01:49:12.900]   And the other is aerobic.
[01:49:12.900 --> 01:49:15.840]   You said that if we can't pull enough,
[01:49:15.840 --> 01:49:19.000]   if we can't break enough bonds,
[01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:22.220]   then we limit our anaerobic capacity.
[01:49:22.220 --> 01:49:23.480]   - Correct.
[01:49:23.480 --> 01:49:26.880]   - I would have thought, given that the mitochondria
[01:49:26.880 --> 01:49:30.040]   are the site for essentially for aerobic metabolism,
[01:49:30.040 --> 01:49:34.600]   that we would be limiting our aerobic capacity as well.
[01:49:34.600 --> 01:49:37.080]   Perhaps you could just clarify for me
[01:49:37.080 --> 01:49:38.280]   how these two things are divided,
[01:49:38.280 --> 01:49:40.000]   or is there not a clean division?
[01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:40.840]   Is it not an either or?
[01:49:40.840 --> 01:49:41.880]   - No, in fact, again,
[01:49:41.880 --> 01:49:43.440]   I think it's better to think of these things
[01:49:43.440 --> 01:49:47.660]   rather as two separate parallel things as one big cycle.
[01:49:47.660 --> 01:49:49.920]   They're one gear turning the next.
[01:49:49.920 --> 01:49:52.840]   Being compromised in one will compromise the other.
[01:49:52.840 --> 01:49:55.720]   - That, I should say, reminds me of what you said earlier,
[01:49:55.720 --> 01:49:58.400]   which is the bicycle gear analogy.
[01:49:58.400 --> 01:49:59.600]   That works great.
[01:49:59.600 --> 01:50:01.240]   So if you short circuit one,
[01:50:01.240 --> 01:50:03.000]   basically the chain can't move.
[01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:04.600]   That's fantastic.
[01:50:04.600 --> 01:50:08.640]   Okay, so indeed they are running in parallel,
[01:50:08.640 --> 01:50:11.660]   but they are interdependent.
[01:50:11.660 --> 01:50:13.760]   - Yeah, well, they're actually not even running in parallel
[01:50:13.760 --> 01:50:17.080]   because they're actually funneling to the same end point.
[01:50:17.080 --> 01:50:18.720]   Which is like, if you're going to come
[01:50:18.720 --> 01:50:20.220]   from the anaerobic glycolysis route,
[01:50:20.220 --> 01:50:21.720]   or you're going to come from the fat route,
[01:50:21.720 --> 01:50:23.040]   which I'll talk about in a second,
[01:50:23.040 --> 01:50:26.120]   they're both going to be limited in the mitochondria.
[01:50:26.120 --> 01:50:27.840]   So when that thing's full, it doesn't matter.
[01:50:27.840 --> 01:50:30.320]   You can't run either system, right?
[01:50:30.320 --> 01:50:32.400]   So it is more of like, again,
[01:50:32.400 --> 01:50:34.040]   if you're running the bike gears,
[01:50:34.040 --> 01:50:36.940]   it doesn't really matter if the back one's larger or smaller
[01:50:36.940 --> 01:50:38.960]   because if either one is limited, you're toast
[01:50:38.960 --> 01:50:41.480]   'cause they're running on the same system.
[01:50:41.480 --> 01:50:44.920]   You can sneak a little bit here and there, but not much.
[01:50:44.920 --> 01:50:49.360]   - You also really nicely highlighted how lactate
[01:50:49.360 --> 01:50:52.960]   this thing that we think of as a limiting factor.
[01:50:52.960 --> 01:50:54.580]   It's like the burn, it gets in the way,
[01:50:54.580 --> 01:50:57.880]   and it's the thing we need to stop and buffer
[01:50:57.880 --> 01:50:59.280]   and all sorts of things.
[01:50:59.280 --> 01:51:00.240]   - Sure.
[01:51:00.240 --> 01:51:01.880]   - It's actually really a fuel.
[01:51:01.880 --> 01:51:03.680]   - It's a tremendously effective fuel.
[01:51:03.680 --> 01:51:06.640]   It is a strongly preferred fuel, actually.
[01:51:06.640 --> 01:51:10.340]   It's interesting, this is a very classic case of association,
[01:51:10.340 --> 01:51:13.200]   correlation versus causation, right?
[01:51:13.200 --> 01:51:14.320]   So the original actually,
[01:51:14.320 --> 01:51:15.640]   there's a really cool history on lactate,
[01:51:15.640 --> 01:51:19.280]   but it was originally found, I think in Germany,
[01:51:19.280 --> 01:51:22.800]   pardon my history there,
[01:51:22.800 --> 01:51:25.760]   somewhere in Europe in hunted stags.
[01:51:25.760 --> 01:51:27.040]   So one of the things is they sort of realized
[01:51:27.040 --> 01:51:30.560]   is like if we harvested a stag in a rest estate
[01:51:30.560 --> 01:51:31.560]   when it didn't know we were there
[01:51:31.560 --> 01:51:33.440]   versus if we chased it and it was ran down,
[01:51:33.440 --> 01:51:35.840]   that these lactate concentrations were significantly higher
[01:51:35.840 --> 01:51:37.680]   in the latter situation.
[01:51:37.680 --> 01:51:40.360]   Therefore, lactate started immediately getting
[01:51:40.360 --> 01:51:42.920]   this association between high fatigue points
[01:51:42.920 --> 01:51:44.380]   and it is easy to measure.
[01:51:44.380 --> 01:51:46.920]   If you're to do any sort of lactate test,
[01:51:46.920 --> 01:51:48.080]   any sort of metabolic test,
[01:51:48.080 --> 01:51:50.040]   you will see as fatigue increases,
[01:51:50.040 --> 01:51:51.760]   lactate will also increase.
[01:51:51.760 --> 01:51:56.260]   The assumption there was then, oh my gosh, it's the cause.
[01:51:56.260 --> 01:51:58.160]   Now we know like, again, it's not the thing,
[01:51:58.160 --> 01:52:01.000]   it's in large part trying to buffer
[01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:05.100]   the negative consequences of ATP hydrolysis
[01:52:05.100 --> 01:52:06.040]   and some other things.
[01:52:06.040 --> 01:52:09.480]   So it is certainly playing a part in that role,
[01:52:09.480 --> 01:52:11.020]   but it is not the core driver.
[01:52:11.020 --> 01:52:13.180]   It's also why you don't need to worry about doing things
[01:52:13.180 --> 01:52:18.000]   to quote unquote reduce lactate in the muscle
[01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.960]   after exercise or to clear lactate or any of those things.
[01:52:20.960 --> 01:52:22.560]   You may still wanna do those activities,
[01:52:22.560 --> 01:52:24.360]   but not for that reason.
[01:52:24.360 --> 01:52:25.200]   Lactate's fine.
[01:52:25.200 --> 01:52:26.640]   You're actually gonna use it in, again,
[01:52:26.640 --> 01:52:30.440]   the neighboring exercise muscle fibers in the same muscle.
[01:52:30.440 --> 01:52:33.680]   Another muscle, you can send it actually to the liver
[01:52:33.680 --> 01:52:35.520]   and it can actually go through gluconeogenesis
[01:52:35.520 --> 01:52:38.980]   and it can actually replenish liver glycogen.
[01:52:38.980 --> 01:52:39.920]   Just does that feel sore?
[01:52:39.920 --> 01:52:41.940]   Sorry, you can send the harder, any number of sources.
[01:52:41.940 --> 01:52:43.920]   You can also just kind of put it in circulation,
[01:52:43.920 --> 01:52:44.980]   put it back in the muscle.
[01:52:44.980 --> 01:52:46.640]   And once enough oxygen is there,
[01:52:46.640 --> 01:52:48.760]   you can just kick it right back into either glucose
[01:52:48.760 --> 01:52:49.600]   or glycogen.
[01:52:49.600 --> 01:52:50.640]   It's totally fine.
[01:52:50.640 --> 01:52:54.080]   So it is obviously clear though.
[01:52:54.080 --> 01:52:56.500]   Once that number gets very, very high,
[01:52:56.500 --> 01:52:57.740]   other things are going to be happening
[01:52:57.740 --> 01:52:59.920]   that are causing a lot of hurt.
[01:52:59.920 --> 01:53:02.340]   And this is your managing waste, right?
[01:53:02.340 --> 01:53:04.280]   Is really an issue of managing,
[01:53:04.280 --> 01:53:06.740]   what am I gonna do with all this extra carbon?
[01:53:06.740 --> 01:53:09.040]   What am I gonna do with all this extra inorganic phosphate
[01:53:09.040 --> 01:53:11.620]   and some other nasty byproducts?
[01:53:11.620 --> 01:53:14.240]   But that's the thing you have to deal with.
[01:53:14.240 --> 01:53:16.300]   - I'd love for you to teach me how different ratios
[01:53:16.300 --> 01:53:19.280]   of fuel sources are used depending on how long
[01:53:19.280 --> 01:53:21.400]   I happen to be exercising.
[01:53:21.400 --> 01:53:26.200]   For example, if I do a very short bout of exercise,
[01:53:26.200 --> 01:53:30.900]   typically that's correlated with a higher intensity output.
[01:53:30.900 --> 01:53:33.040]   I mean, I suppose I could jog for one minute,
[01:53:33.040 --> 01:53:37.480]   but here I'm thinking about sprinting for one minute or less.
[01:53:37.480 --> 01:53:38.720]   Which fuels are used?
[01:53:38.720 --> 01:53:43.320]   Is that mainly driven by fat stores, by carbohydrate stores?
[01:53:43.320 --> 01:53:46.060]   Is it driven by dietary fat preferentially
[01:53:46.060 --> 01:53:48.320]   or carbohydrate that I've ingested?
[01:53:48.320 --> 01:53:52.100]   If indeed I've ingested those or protein for that matter.
[01:53:52.100 --> 01:53:55.060]   And then as we transition to exercise
[01:53:55.060 --> 01:53:57.060]   that goes a little bit longer,
[01:53:57.060 --> 01:54:01.240]   anywhere from three to five minutes,
[01:54:01.240 --> 01:54:02.960]   how do those ratios change?
[01:54:02.960 --> 01:54:06.380]   And as we transition to longer duration,
[01:54:06.380 --> 01:54:08.360]   what most people think of as endurance exercise,
[01:54:08.360 --> 01:54:12.800]   but long duration output of 20 minutes or more
[01:54:12.800 --> 01:54:15.040]   leading all the way up to full marathon.
[01:54:15.040 --> 01:54:17.120]   How does that change the ratio of fuel sources
[01:54:17.120 --> 01:54:18.100]   that are used?
[01:54:18.100 --> 01:54:21.200]   And I'd be particularly interested in distinguishing
[01:54:21.200 --> 01:54:25.860]   between carbohydrate fat and protein that's ingested.
[01:54:25.860 --> 01:54:30.280]   So coming from food sources or carbohydrate fat and protein
[01:54:30.280 --> 01:54:33.060]   that are coming from storage sites within the body.
[01:54:33.060 --> 01:54:33.900]   - Okay, great.
[01:54:33.900 --> 01:54:34.940]   Let's start at zero seconds
[01:54:34.940 --> 01:54:36.960]   and run all the way through marathon.
[01:54:36.960 --> 01:54:40.240]   And we'll flag the distinctions where they start changing.
[01:54:40.240 --> 01:54:43.360]   As soon as you want to create muscle contraction and power,
[01:54:43.360 --> 01:54:46.240]   the very first source of energy is phosphocreatine.
[01:54:46.240 --> 01:54:49.580]   That's going to power you for zero to maybe say eight
[01:54:49.580 --> 01:54:52.080]   to 15, 20 seconds of maximal exertion.
[01:54:52.080 --> 01:54:54.560]   - And that's coming from the muscle fibers themselves?
[01:54:54.560 --> 01:54:55.740]   - Yeah, that is actually stored
[01:54:55.740 --> 01:54:57.200]   in what's called the cytoplasm.
[01:54:57.200 --> 01:55:00.120]   So this is a little area or space in the muscle fiber
[01:55:00.120 --> 01:55:03.040]   that's sort of like in this jelly-like substance.
[01:55:03.040 --> 01:55:06.340]   And it's nice because one molecule of phosphocreatine
[01:55:06.340 --> 01:55:08.320]   gives you one molecule of ATP.
[01:55:08.320 --> 01:55:10.520]   So it's not a big energy output,
[01:55:10.520 --> 01:55:12.860]   but it's very fast because it is stored right there
[01:55:12.860 --> 01:55:15.440]   in the local exercising muscle.
[01:55:15.440 --> 01:55:18.320]   Now, if you need energy past that point,
[01:55:18.320 --> 01:55:22.360]   say 10 or 15 seconds up to maybe a couple of minutes,
[01:55:22.360 --> 01:55:23.960]   this is now you're going to have to transition
[01:55:23.960 --> 01:55:25.760]   because you're going to burn through that phosphocreatine
[01:55:25.760 --> 01:55:27.260]   and it's going to be out.
[01:55:27.260 --> 01:55:29.740]   You're going to have to move to now carbohydrate metabolism.
[01:55:29.740 --> 01:55:32.480]   This is what we call anaerobic glycolysis.
[01:55:32.480 --> 01:55:34.560]   So there's two phases of glycolysis.
[01:55:34.560 --> 01:55:39.000]   Now, glycolysis itself means glucose burning, all right?
[01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.880]   So it just means we're using carbohydrate as a fuel source.
[01:55:41.880 --> 01:55:44.560]   So initially, when we start off this cascade,
[01:55:44.560 --> 01:55:48.940]   which is going to take us again for a couple of minutes,
[01:55:48.940 --> 01:55:51.240]   carbohydrate utilization comes first
[01:55:51.240 --> 01:55:52.680]   from the exercising muscle.
[01:55:52.680 --> 01:55:55.540]   So it's very similar to phosphocreatine that way.
[01:55:55.540 --> 01:55:57.360]   If you start running low on it,
[01:55:57.360 --> 01:55:59.820]   you can actually start pulling blood glucose.
[01:55:59.820 --> 01:56:01.140]   And if blood glucose gets low,
[01:56:01.140 --> 01:56:02.980]   you'll have to start getting glycogen from the liver
[01:56:02.980 --> 01:56:03.820]   to keep that up.
[01:56:03.820 --> 01:56:05.820]   So we've sort of covered that conversation.
[01:56:05.820 --> 01:56:07.140]   All right, so a little bit of chemistry here,
[01:56:07.140 --> 01:56:10.040]   just give me a little bit of room here.
[01:56:10.040 --> 01:56:12.760]   So now remember a carbohydrate is a carbon molecule
[01:56:12.760 --> 01:56:14.140]   that has been hydrated.
[01:56:14.140 --> 01:56:16.480]   So one carbon attached to one water,
[01:56:16.480 --> 01:56:18.840]   and remember water is H2O.
[01:56:18.840 --> 01:56:21.300]   Most of the time when we're talking about glucose,
[01:56:21.300 --> 01:56:24.040]   it is in a six carbon chain.
[01:56:24.040 --> 01:56:28.000]   So six carbons attached to six water molecules.
[01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:29.220]   All right, great.
[01:56:29.220 --> 01:56:31.820]   When I go to split this up through anaerobic glycolysis,
[01:56:31.820 --> 01:56:33.560]   it works a little bit like this.
[01:56:33.560 --> 01:56:36.360]   So you've got this six carbon chain.
[01:56:36.360 --> 01:56:38.540]   The first step is to snap that thing in half.
[01:56:38.540 --> 01:56:41.220]   You're gonna make two, three carbon chains.
[01:56:41.220 --> 01:56:43.060]   Now we broke one bond right there,
[01:56:43.060 --> 01:56:44.440]   so we got a little bit of energy,
[01:56:44.440 --> 01:56:46.280]   but not a tremendous amount.
[01:56:46.280 --> 01:56:47.940]   At the end of anaerobic glycolysis,
[01:56:47.940 --> 01:56:51.560]   you're gonna net something like three or four ATP.
[01:56:51.560 --> 01:56:53.320]   - So more than you get from the phosphocreatine system?
[01:56:53.320 --> 01:56:56.620]   - Triple or quadruple, but still not very much.
[01:56:56.620 --> 01:56:59.680]   There's another major downside that's coming in a second
[01:56:59.680 --> 01:57:00.840]   to this system.
[01:57:00.840 --> 01:57:03.120]   The upside is it's fast.
[01:57:03.120 --> 01:57:07.620]   Now actually one adaptation we get to training in this style
[01:57:07.620 --> 01:57:10.840]   is you'll increase your ability to store glycogen
[01:57:10.840 --> 01:57:13.280]   in your muscle, which is great, right?
[01:57:13.280 --> 01:57:15.160]   We can actually biopsy you and measure the amount
[01:57:15.160 --> 01:57:17.360]   that you store and a training adaptation is awesome.
[01:57:17.360 --> 01:57:20.140]   So you're able to sustain the system longer.
[01:57:20.140 --> 01:57:24.160]   So perhaps 90 seconds into your interval training,
[01:57:24.160 --> 01:57:26.980]   you hit a fatigue point and now you maybe can extend that
[01:57:26.980 --> 01:57:29.520]   to 100 or 115 seconds simply because you're storing
[01:57:29.520 --> 01:57:32.520]   more glycogen in the muscle.
[01:57:32.520 --> 01:57:34.280]   Before we have to then go into the blood
[01:57:34.280 --> 01:57:36.080]   and get it in the form of glucose.
[01:57:36.080 --> 01:57:37.000]   So that's great.
[01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:38.760]   So we've got this six carbon molecule
[01:57:38.760 --> 01:57:41.160]   and we split this in half, we got that little bit of ATP.
[01:57:41.160 --> 01:57:44.780]   And now we're in this little tricky position
[01:57:44.780 --> 01:57:47.000]   because this three carbon molecule
[01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.040]   is what we call pyruvate, pyruvic acid.
[01:57:49.040 --> 01:57:52.640]   And again, chemistry folks, I'm skipping some steps.
[01:57:52.640 --> 01:57:54.560]   I'm gonna intentionally make some mistakes here.
[01:57:54.560 --> 01:57:57.220]   I'm making sure the entire world listening,
[01:57:57.220 --> 01:57:59.960]   regardless of where they come in, can follow me here, okay?
[01:57:59.960 --> 01:58:01.560]   So don't burn me on the details.
[01:58:02.400 --> 01:58:03.960]   Right, you've got this pyruvate.
[01:58:03.960 --> 01:58:06.280]   The problem is you can no longer do anything
[01:58:06.280 --> 01:58:08.400]   with that glycolysis is over.
[01:58:08.400 --> 01:58:10.820]   You've got to make a choice, right?
[01:58:10.820 --> 01:58:13.200]   In order to make something out of those three carbon
[01:58:13.200 --> 01:58:15.440]   molecules, you've got to shift them to the mitochondria.
[01:58:15.440 --> 01:58:19.340]   As you said, that is the only place of aerobic metabolism.
[01:58:19.340 --> 01:58:22.600]   We cannot do aerobic metabolism anywhere else
[01:58:22.600 --> 01:58:23.760]   until we enter the mitochondria.
[01:58:23.760 --> 01:58:25.280]   So anytime we cross that barrier,
[01:58:25.280 --> 01:58:26.520]   we know we've automatically switched
[01:58:26.520 --> 01:58:28.080]   from anaerobic to aerobic.
[01:58:28.080 --> 01:58:30.120]   Well, here's the problem.
[01:58:30.120 --> 01:58:32.420]   If you were to take one more carbon
[01:58:32.420 --> 01:58:34.720]   off that three carbon pyruvate,
[01:58:34.720 --> 01:58:39.380]   you have to now do something with that carbon waste, okay?
[01:58:39.380 --> 01:58:41.500]   So before, when we split the six carbon chain,
[01:58:41.500 --> 01:58:44.140]   we didn't actually leave any carbons free floating.
[01:58:44.140 --> 01:58:47.080]   We just split a two molecule in half.
[01:58:47.080 --> 01:58:48.760]   When we go to split from pyruvate
[01:58:48.760 --> 01:58:50.320]   and make it into this two carbon molecule
[01:58:50.320 --> 01:58:52.900]   called acetyl-CoA or CoA,
[01:58:52.900 --> 01:58:55.560]   now we've got a free floating carbon.
[01:58:55.560 --> 01:58:56.720]   We have to have a strategy for that
[01:58:56.720 --> 01:58:58.780]   because that's going to increase the acidity level.
[01:58:58.780 --> 01:59:01.400]   Any enzyme in our body that works to create fuel
[01:59:01.400 --> 01:59:05.100]   is very pH sensitive, right?
[01:59:05.100 --> 01:59:08.580]   So if this thing, if pH gets off either high or low,
[01:59:08.580 --> 01:59:09.640]   these enzymes can't work.
[01:59:09.640 --> 01:59:10.680]   And that's really, really important
[01:59:10.680 --> 01:59:13.680]   because even if I were to give you a direct injection of ATP,
[01:59:13.680 --> 01:59:15.460]   remember that's that energy currency,
[01:59:15.460 --> 01:59:18.040]   that's the only way we can actually form energy.
[01:59:18.040 --> 01:59:19.440]   I guess, remember to clarify,
[01:59:19.440 --> 01:59:23.220]   anytime we're using phosphocreatine or glucose or fat,
[01:59:23.220 --> 01:59:24.380]   which we'll get to in a second,
[01:59:24.380 --> 01:59:26.360]   we're not actually getting energy for exercise
[01:59:26.360 --> 01:59:28.060]   by breaking those down.
[01:59:28.060 --> 01:59:30.960]   We're getting energy that we can use to then make ATP.
[01:59:30.960 --> 01:59:32.280]   We break that ATP down.
[01:59:32.280 --> 01:59:34.680]   That's what's actually powering muscle contraction.
[01:59:34.680 --> 01:59:36.200]   You can go back to our previous episode
[01:59:36.200 --> 01:59:37.800]   where we'll walk you through the detail
[01:59:37.800 --> 01:59:41.480]   of the muscle contraction, but that's what we're after, okay?
[01:59:41.480 --> 01:59:45.200]   So in the case of pyruvate, if we split that off,
[01:59:45.200 --> 01:59:46.400]   we have got to deal with that.
[01:59:46.400 --> 01:59:47.920]   And the only way and the best way
[01:59:47.920 --> 01:59:49.440]   we can deal with that is oxygen.
[01:59:49.440 --> 01:59:51.500]   Remember, we're going to breathe in O2.
[01:59:51.500 --> 01:59:54.340]   That O2 is going to combine with that free floating carbon,
[01:59:54.340 --> 01:59:56.860]   make CO2, we're going to exhale that thing out.
[01:59:56.860 --> 01:59:59.340]   That's our waste management strategy.
[01:59:59.340 --> 02:00:03.320]   But that has to happen in the mitochondria.
[02:00:03.320 --> 02:00:04.960]   Remember, if we're using oxygen,
[02:00:04.960 --> 02:00:07.080]   it has to be in the mitochondria.
[02:00:07.080 --> 02:00:10.840]   So if we have the ability to ship pyruvate
[02:00:10.840 --> 02:00:13.560]   into the mitochondria, we're golden.
[02:00:13.560 --> 02:00:16.120]   But what happens if we don't?
[02:00:16.120 --> 02:00:18.360]   Why do we not?
[02:00:18.360 --> 02:00:20.360]   Well, if we don't have enough mitochondria
[02:00:20.360 --> 02:00:23.920]   or our mitochondria are too small or they're too far away,
[02:00:23.920 --> 02:00:27.340]   or we don't have sufficient oxygen availability,
[02:00:27.340 --> 02:00:29.480]   why don't we have sufficient oxygen availability?
[02:00:29.480 --> 02:00:31.980]   Because we created the pyruvate too fast.
[02:00:31.980 --> 02:00:35.260]   And the demand in the mitochondria
[02:00:35.260 --> 02:00:38.260]   is exceeded by the buildup of pyruvate.
[02:00:38.260 --> 02:00:40.780]   And so now we're having this giant backlog
[02:00:40.780 --> 02:00:43.300]   and this thing fills up fast.
[02:00:43.300 --> 02:00:45.100]   We have a couple of strategies here.
[02:00:45.100 --> 02:00:48.740]   Well, when you're going through ATP and you're splitting,
[02:00:48.740 --> 02:00:50.940]   it's called ATP hydrolysis.
[02:00:50.940 --> 02:00:55.160]   In doing that, remember ATP is an adenosine molecule
[02:00:55.160 --> 02:00:57.920]   and then the T part is triphosphate, one, two, three,
[02:00:57.920 --> 02:01:00.920]   which means you have three phosphates attached at the end.
[02:01:00.920 --> 02:01:02.500]   When you break that phosphate off,
[02:01:02.500 --> 02:01:03.460]   that's where you get your energy.
[02:01:03.460 --> 02:01:05.640]   And so now you have an inorganic phosphate
[02:01:05.640 --> 02:01:08.620]   and an ADP, adenosine diphosphate, two.
[02:01:08.620 --> 02:01:13.580]   That process requires water, it's called hydrolysis.
[02:01:13.580 --> 02:01:17.820]   As a result of that, you then have a free floating hydrogen.
[02:01:17.820 --> 02:01:20.700]   And as you well know, that is acid, right?
[02:01:20.700 --> 02:01:22.080]   That's potential hydrogen.
[02:01:22.080 --> 02:01:22.920]   That's what that means.
[02:01:22.920 --> 02:01:26.940]   And so you've increased the acidity in the muscle
[02:01:26.940 --> 02:01:29.180]   by breaking up all this ATP.
[02:01:29.180 --> 02:01:32.060]   And so, uh-oh, we're building up acid.
[02:01:32.060 --> 02:01:33.700]   We are building up pyruvate.
[02:01:33.700 --> 02:01:35.620]   We don't have nowhere to go with it.
[02:01:35.620 --> 02:01:38.200]   And we can't cleave off a carbon
[02:01:38.200 --> 02:01:43.100]   because now we're just gonna exacerbate the acid increase.
[02:01:43.100 --> 02:01:45.140]   So what we can do is we can take those hydrogens
[02:01:45.140 --> 02:01:48.160]   that we're building up and store them on the pyruvate.
[02:01:48.160 --> 02:01:50.300]   A pyruvate that's holding an extra acid
[02:01:50.300 --> 02:01:54.060]   that has a special name, and we call that lactate, right?
[02:01:54.060 --> 02:01:56.180]   So that's why we see this buildup of lactate.
[02:01:56.180 --> 02:01:58.740]   So one of the downsides of anaerobic glycolysis
[02:01:58.740 --> 02:02:03.260]   is an incredibly high rate of waste production.
[02:02:03.260 --> 02:02:08.980]   Now lactate is not the cause of fatigue.
[02:02:08.980 --> 02:02:10.620]   In fact, if you think a little bit more carefully
[02:02:10.620 --> 02:02:13.120]   about what I just said, it's actually stopping you.
[02:02:13.120 --> 02:02:15.900]   It's what we call a acid buffer.
[02:02:15.900 --> 02:02:17.240]   You can actually use it for a bunch of other things.
[02:02:17.240 --> 02:02:19.420]   You can ship it to a neighboring muscle fiber
[02:02:19.420 --> 02:02:21.140]   in the same muscle that's not working.
[02:02:21.140 --> 02:02:22.140]   You can ship it to the liver.
[02:02:22.140 --> 02:02:24.500]   You can ship it to the heart and a bunch of other places,
[02:02:24.500 --> 02:02:26.020]   and then you can actually just work backwards.
[02:02:26.020 --> 02:02:27.860]   So if you ship it to, for example, the heart,
[02:02:27.860 --> 02:02:30.180]   and it's got a bunch of mitochondria that are free,
[02:02:30.180 --> 02:02:32.300]   you can bring in the oxygen,
[02:02:32.300 --> 02:02:34.660]   attach it to that hydrogen, make water,
[02:02:34.660 --> 02:02:36.060]   and now you're right back to pyruvate.
[02:02:36.060 --> 02:02:37.600]   You put two pyruvate back together,
[02:02:37.600 --> 02:02:39.040]   and now you just make glucose.
[02:02:39.040 --> 02:02:40.940]   So you can actually store it in the liver.
[02:02:40.940 --> 02:02:43.700]   This is a process called gluconeogenesis
[02:02:43.700 --> 02:02:45.540]   through this fancy thing called the Corey cycle,
[02:02:45.540 --> 02:02:49.540]   which is what the proper cycle here is.
[02:02:49.540 --> 02:02:51.140]   So you can use it as a very potent fuel source.
[02:02:51.140 --> 02:02:54.620]   In fact, a lactate is a tremendously valuable fuel source,
[02:02:54.620 --> 02:02:56.500]   not only for exercise, but for cognition
[02:02:56.500 --> 02:02:57.580]   and a bunch of other things.
[02:02:57.580 --> 02:02:59.820]   So lactates, in fact, this is why,
[02:02:59.820 --> 02:03:01.940]   if you've seen any of the research
[02:03:01.940 --> 02:03:06.240]   about pre-exam testing exercise,
[02:03:06.240 --> 02:03:08.180]   you'll see a noticeable increase in exam scores
[02:03:08.180 --> 02:03:10.700]   if you do a 20-minute bout of exercise prior
[02:03:10.700 --> 02:03:13.460]   to taking the exam, and it's largely in part,
[02:03:13.460 --> 02:03:16.020]   probably because of things like elevations and lactate.
[02:03:16.020 --> 02:03:21.020]   - How intense of exercise would be most beneficial?
[02:03:21.020 --> 02:03:22.300]   - I don't know that exact answer.
[02:03:22.300 --> 02:03:25.800]   I just know that generally any form of exercise is good,
[02:03:25.800 --> 02:03:28.220]   but if you were to reach a reasonably high heart rate,
[02:03:28.220 --> 02:03:29.060]   you're probably gonna see,
[02:03:29.060 --> 02:03:31.380]   and in fact, there's an acute and chronic adaptation here.
[02:03:31.380 --> 02:03:35.240]   So folks that exercise have better memory retention,
[02:03:35.240 --> 02:03:36.820]   score, and some exams, et cetera,
[02:03:36.820 --> 02:03:39.840]   but then also doing it prior to that exam,
[02:03:39.840 --> 02:03:41.700]   make sure you recovered and rested back down to straight,
[02:03:41.700 --> 02:03:43.320]   but you'll generally perform better.
[02:03:43.320 --> 02:03:45.880]   - Previous guest on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:03:45.880 --> 02:03:49.600]   who's a psychology professor and neuroscientist
[02:03:49.600 --> 02:03:51.680]   and also Dean of College of Arts and Sciences
[02:03:51.680 --> 02:03:54.940]   at New York University, NYU, Wendy Suzuki,
[02:03:54.940 --> 02:03:59.940]   is religious about daily morning exercise,
[02:03:59.940 --> 02:04:02.300]   specifically for this purpose of enhancing learning
[02:04:02.300 --> 02:04:05.260]   and memory, and has a lot of really beautiful data.
[02:04:05.260 --> 02:04:08.000]   I consider her one of the real pioneers in this space.
[02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.380]   So if people wanna learn more,
[02:04:10.380 --> 02:04:12.640]   they can look to that episode or Wendy's work.
[02:04:12.640 --> 02:04:14.660]   We can provide a link to a couple of the papers,
[02:04:14.660 --> 02:04:19.460]   but this is fantastic in that it's incredibly clear.
[02:04:19.460 --> 02:04:20.360]   I think for the first time,
[02:04:20.360 --> 02:04:24.200]   I'm understanding what lactate is really doing,
[02:04:24.200 --> 02:04:26.920]   and it's dispelling a lot of myths
[02:04:26.920 --> 02:04:30.160]   that I think I and a lot of other people arrive
[02:04:30.160 --> 02:04:32.960]   to the discussion about lactate with.
[02:04:32.960 --> 02:04:37.960]   What happens when the bout of exercise extends longer?
[02:04:37.960 --> 02:04:38.940]   - Amazing.
[02:04:38.940 --> 02:04:42.120]   So if we wanna continue past that point,
[02:04:42.120 --> 02:04:45.080]   we have to have some sort of strategy to get through it.
[02:04:45.080 --> 02:04:47.400]   We're stuck, we're out of gas.
[02:04:47.400 --> 02:04:49.120]   We have to then ship it to the mitochondria,
[02:04:49.120 --> 02:04:52.540]   and now we're gonna enter what's called aerobic glycolysis.
[02:04:52.540 --> 02:04:55.060]   And this is gonna take us anywhere from, again,
[02:04:55.060 --> 02:04:57.880]   say that 90 seconds of all-out work
[02:04:57.880 --> 02:04:59.440]   up to really 20, 30 minutes.
[02:04:59.440 --> 02:05:02.180]   In fact, it really will take us to unlimited.
[02:05:02.180 --> 02:05:05.120]   If you look at a highly competitive marathon runner,
[02:05:05.120 --> 02:05:07.580]   even those that are running, say, your two-hour marathon,
[02:05:07.580 --> 02:05:10.100]   those folks are burning up to 80% carbohydrate.
[02:05:10.980 --> 02:05:14.260]   It is not a fat-burning thing,
[02:05:14.260 --> 02:05:17.460]   and the reason is fat metabolism is way too slow.
[02:05:17.460 --> 02:05:20.260]   It provides a lot of energy, but it is incredibly slow.
[02:05:20.260 --> 02:05:23.780]   If you're trying to run a 4 1/2 or so minute mile
[02:05:23.780 --> 02:05:27.100]   repeated 26 times, you have to be moving fast.
[02:05:27.100 --> 02:05:29.180]   - Are they ingesting carbohydrate
[02:05:29.180 --> 02:05:31.280]   as a fuel source during the race?
[02:05:31.280 --> 02:05:34.780]   - Unless you're on the team, you don't know.
[02:05:34.780 --> 02:05:35.680]   They won't really tell you.
[02:05:35.680 --> 02:05:38.020]   These are sort of trade secrets.
[02:05:38.020 --> 02:05:40.940]   It would be, I would say, fairly rare
[02:05:40.940 --> 02:05:42.500]   to not have something, right?
[02:05:42.500 --> 02:05:43.620]   There's a bunch of different strategies.
[02:05:43.620 --> 02:05:46.780]   If you're gonna go really long, like some of these,
[02:05:46.780 --> 02:05:50.300]   like cycling, where the races will be several hours,
[02:05:50.300 --> 02:05:53.620]   then you actually might go to some fat as fuel sources.
[02:05:53.620 --> 02:05:56.540]   I know a lot of cyclists are using ketones
[02:05:56.540 --> 02:05:57.620]   and things like that now.
[02:05:57.620 --> 02:05:59.620]   But traditionally, most endurance folks
[02:05:59.620 --> 02:06:01.820]   are gonna bias heavily towards carbohydrate.
[02:06:01.820 --> 02:06:06.360]   Now, in one respect,
[02:06:06.360 --> 02:06:08.940]   you're not going to run out of carbohydrates
[02:06:08.940 --> 02:06:10.540]   until you're many hours in.
[02:06:10.540 --> 02:06:12.100]   These folks are a unique case,
[02:06:12.100 --> 02:06:15.140]   but the average individual who's doing an hour,
[02:06:15.140 --> 02:06:16.660]   hour and a half cardio even,
[02:06:16.660 --> 02:06:20.380]   you're not going to be limited by your carbohydrate stores.
[02:06:20.380 --> 02:06:21.420]   You're gonna be just fine.
[02:06:21.420 --> 02:06:22.840]   You're gonna be limited by some other things,
[02:06:22.840 --> 02:06:25.860]   which we'll maybe sort of break down here in a second,
[02:06:25.860 --> 02:06:26.900]   but you're gonna be fine there.
[02:06:26.900 --> 02:06:29.320]   A lot of those folks will take carbohydrate, though,
[02:06:29.320 --> 02:06:30.480]   at very specific intervals.
[02:06:30.480 --> 02:06:32.780]   You do wanna be careful, though,
[02:06:32.780 --> 02:06:36.140]   of ingesting too many fast carbohydrates
[02:06:36.140 --> 02:06:38.880]   prior to your exercise spell.
[02:06:38.880 --> 02:06:40.100]   We have actually have this little thing
[02:06:40.100 --> 02:06:43.080]   that's called the insulin glucose double whammy.
[02:06:43.080 --> 02:06:46.440]   And what that means is when you ingest carbohydrates,
[02:06:46.440 --> 02:06:48.360]   immediately your blood glucose goes up,
[02:06:48.360 --> 02:06:50.600]   and that's depending on the type of carbohydrate
[02:06:50.600 --> 02:06:51.480]   and things like that.
[02:06:51.480 --> 02:06:53.340]   Well, the same thing happens with exercise.
[02:06:53.340 --> 02:06:55.520]   And so what happens is insulin
[02:06:55.520 --> 02:06:57.660]   wants to start pulling glucose out of the blood.
[02:06:57.660 --> 02:07:00.140]   At the same time, muscle wants to start pulling glucose
[02:07:00.140 --> 02:07:00.980]   out of the blood.
[02:07:00.980 --> 02:07:03.240]   And so we have this giant bolus of carbohydrate come in,
[02:07:03.240 --> 02:07:06.580]   and then all of a sudden our blood sugar crashes.
[02:07:06.580 --> 02:07:08.540]   And so if you're going to be doing so
[02:07:08.540 --> 02:07:11.480]   your first half marathon or something like that,
[02:07:11.480 --> 02:07:13.100]   and you're in those giant corrals
[02:07:13.100 --> 02:07:15.000]   where there's like 100 people waiting to go,
[02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:16.780]   and you're standing there for 45 minutes,
[02:07:16.780 --> 02:07:19.100]   you may or may not wanna slug down
[02:07:19.100 --> 02:07:22.180]   like three or four bananas and a bagel and honey.
[02:07:22.180 --> 02:07:25.020]   You probably don't need that.
[02:07:25.020 --> 02:07:27.620]   Now, not everyone experiences this double whammy,
[02:07:27.620 --> 02:07:28.940]   but it has been shown in the literature
[02:07:28.940 --> 02:07:29.820]   to happen to some people.
[02:07:29.820 --> 02:07:32.340]   So you wanna just be a little bit careful.
[02:07:32.340 --> 02:07:35.520]   An easy way to combat that is just practice
[02:07:35.520 --> 02:07:37.240]   exactly what you're going to do in your race
[02:07:37.240 --> 02:07:38.600]   in your training.
[02:07:38.600 --> 02:07:40.180]   That's like the simplest advice ever,
[02:07:40.180 --> 02:07:43.420]   but you'd be stunned how many people do things
[02:07:43.420 --> 02:07:45.000]   during the race that they've actually never done in training.
[02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:48.040]   - I suggest people do exactly what you describe
[02:07:48.040 --> 02:07:50.580]   also for any kind of cognitive testing.
[02:07:50.580 --> 02:07:51.420]   - Of course.
[02:07:51.420 --> 02:07:53.460]   - Before a big exam is not the time to discover
[02:07:53.460 --> 02:07:56.260]   whether or not you can handle twice as much espresso
[02:07:56.260 --> 02:08:01.020]   or take a nootropic for the first time or change anything.
[02:08:01.020 --> 02:08:03.780]   I mean, if indeed the score on that exam
[02:08:03.780 --> 02:08:06.580]   is meaningful to you, you keep things regular.
[02:08:06.580 --> 02:08:08.140]   - So to recap what we've done here
[02:08:08.140 --> 02:08:10.180]   is we started off in the cytoplasm
[02:08:10.180 --> 02:08:12.140]   with this glucose molecule that is six carbons.
[02:08:12.140 --> 02:08:13.960]   We took that thing, we split it in half.
[02:08:13.960 --> 02:08:15.620]   We call that thing anaerobic glycolysis.
[02:08:15.620 --> 02:08:17.980]   We made a little bit of energy, but not much.
[02:08:17.980 --> 02:08:19.460]   We take those three carbon molecules,
[02:08:19.460 --> 02:08:21.180]   we ship them into the mitochondria.
[02:08:21.180 --> 02:08:24.340]   We take each one of those, we clear off one carbon each.
[02:08:24.340 --> 02:08:26.060]   Those carbons, we take a breath in,
[02:08:26.060 --> 02:08:28.460]   we attach them to oxygen, we exhale them,
[02:08:28.460 --> 02:08:29.300]   get rid of that energy.
[02:08:29.300 --> 02:08:32.360]   We are now fully into aerobic glycolysis.
[02:08:32.360 --> 02:08:33.900]   Each one of those two carbon molecules
[02:08:33.900 --> 02:08:36.540]   we run through the Krebs cycle.
[02:08:36.540 --> 02:08:39.620]   Each round of the Krebs cycle burns one, two carbons.
[02:08:39.620 --> 02:08:41.860]   So we go one, two, one, two,
[02:08:41.860 --> 02:08:43.900]   and now we've gone from six carbon molecule
[02:08:43.900 --> 02:08:44.900]   all the way down to zero.
[02:08:44.900 --> 02:08:48.260]   We used the hydrogens that we pulled off of that
[02:08:48.260 --> 02:08:50.620]   Krebs cycle run to go to the electron transport chain.
[02:08:50.620 --> 02:08:52.900]   From there, we made a whole bunch of ATP.
[02:08:52.900 --> 02:08:54.880]   And so we have now fully metabolized
[02:08:54.880 --> 02:08:56.480]   one molecule of carbohydrate,
[02:08:56.480 --> 02:09:01.020]   and the end product of all of it is simply ATP, water,
[02:09:01.020 --> 02:09:01.860]   and CO2.
[02:09:01.860 --> 02:09:04.000]   - Beautiful.
[02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:09.800]   And leads me to the conclusion that most everything
[02:09:09.800 --> 02:09:15.300]   is really about utilization of carbons and exhaling CO2.
[02:09:15.300 --> 02:09:18.180]   Is that how I should think about bookending,
[02:09:18.180 --> 02:09:19.420]   what you just described?
[02:09:19.420 --> 02:09:21.260]   - This is why we started off the conversation
[02:09:21.260 --> 02:09:23.160]   with the circle of life.
[02:09:23.160 --> 02:09:24.680]   This is really a carbon game.
[02:09:24.680 --> 02:09:29.680]   This is why we call chemistry with carbon organic chemistry.
[02:09:29.680 --> 02:09:31.380]   That's what this whole thing is about.
[02:09:31.380 --> 02:09:35.540]   Any living being has to run through metabolism.
[02:09:35.540 --> 02:09:37.580]   It's all a carbon game.
[02:09:37.580 --> 02:09:39.860]   Any living being has to use ATP.
[02:09:39.860 --> 02:09:42.300]   This is all just a big fancy game
[02:09:42.300 --> 02:09:45.140]   of how do I make ATP and handle the waste?
[02:09:45.140 --> 02:09:49.240]   Remember, endurance is all about waste management,
[02:09:49.240 --> 02:09:53.180]   fatigue resistance, the same thing, and energy production.
[02:09:53.180 --> 02:09:54.980]   We're playing a game here.
[02:09:54.980 --> 02:09:58.640]   The whole game, bring in energy, use it,
[02:09:58.640 --> 02:10:00.560]   mitigate waste products.
[02:10:00.560 --> 02:10:02.580]   - So when thinking about aerobic exercise
[02:10:02.580 --> 02:10:05.140]   or long duration exercise, in this case,
[02:10:05.140 --> 02:10:07.880]   anything longer than five minutes for that matter,
[02:10:07.880 --> 02:10:10.420]   five minutes all the way up to an ultra marathon,
[02:10:10.420 --> 02:10:15.720]   the breathing associated with endurance exercise,
[02:10:15.720 --> 02:10:17.620]   the heart beating, which of course is associated
[02:10:17.620 --> 02:10:20.040]   with the breathing and vice versa,
[02:10:20.040 --> 02:10:23.380]   it's really all about bringing oxygen into the system
[02:10:23.380 --> 02:10:26.560]   that then allows those carbons to be used
[02:10:26.560 --> 02:10:30.560]   and within the mitochondria specifically,
[02:10:30.560 --> 02:10:33.840]   and then carbon dioxide to be exhaled
[02:10:33.840 --> 02:10:36.040]   as we work through the carbons
[02:10:36.040 --> 02:10:38.040]   on the sort of beads on a string.
[02:10:38.040 --> 02:10:38.920]   Is that right?
[02:10:38.920 --> 02:10:41.120]   - Unless you're moving incredibly fast
[02:10:41.120 --> 02:10:42.320]   for a very long time,
[02:10:42.320 --> 02:10:45.120]   and we're talking probably north of 90 minutes,
[02:10:45.120 --> 02:10:48.940]   endurance is really not a game
[02:10:48.940 --> 02:10:50.960]   of making sure I have enough fuel.
[02:10:50.960 --> 02:10:54.320]   It is simply managing the waste production,
[02:10:54.320 --> 02:10:55.680]   and that's exactly what you described.
[02:10:55.680 --> 02:10:57.480]   You need to bring in the oxygen
[02:10:57.480 --> 02:10:59.520]   so you can handle the carbon that's building up
[02:10:59.520 --> 02:11:03.740]   as a result of both the anaerobic glycolysis.
[02:11:03.740 --> 02:11:05.480]   That's our game here.
[02:11:05.480 --> 02:11:07.940]   If we start talking about endurance events longer than that,
[02:11:07.940 --> 02:11:09.600]   now we do have to start worrying
[02:11:09.600 --> 02:11:11.320]   about running out of muscle glycogen,
[02:11:11.320 --> 02:11:13.420]   running out of liver glycogen, et cetera,
[02:11:13.420 --> 02:11:15.280]   or if we are at that two hour mark or so
[02:11:15.280 --> 02:11:17.280]   and we're moving very, very, very fast,
[02:11:17.280 --> 02:11:19.260]   but anything south of that
[02:11:19.260 --> 02:11:22.980]   is just managing carbon buildup,
[02:11:22.980 --> 02:11:25.100]   and we do that best through oxygen utilization
[02:11:25.100 --> 02:11:27.540]   or getting more efficient,
[02:11:27.540 --> 02:11:31.220]   having a higher capacity for our anaerobic side.
[02:11:31.220 --> 02:11:33.860]   So we can do that by having either more glycogen
[02:11:33.860 --> 02:11:36.460]   in our muscle so that lasts longer
[02:11:36.460 --> 02:11:40.620]   or building better acid buffering systems.
[02:11:40.620 --> 02:11:42.720]   And there's a whole line of supplementation
[02:11:42.720 --> 02:11:44.580]   that are specifically acid buffers.
[02:11:44.580 --> 02:11:46.380]   There's a whole line of training.
[02:11:46.380 --> 02:11:49.160]   There's a whole line of breathing to manage this, that.
[02:11:49.160 --> 02:11:50.940]   So we have a lot of strategies
[02:11:50.940 --> 02:11:52.440]   where we can maximize endurance.
[02:11:52.440 --> 02:11:54.720]   All we have to do is go back
[02:11:54.720 --> 02:11:56.020]   to the earlier part of our talk,
[02:11:56.020 --> 02:12:00.160]   which is figure out what's the actual limiting step
[02:12:00.160 --> 02:12:02.420]   and then train according to that,
[02:12:02.420 --> 02:12:05.900]   or do your strategy, your nutrition, your supplementation,
[02:12:05.900 --> 02:12:08.340]   that defeats that limiting factor.
[02:12:08.340 --> 02:12:11.460]   For an example, if you were trying to maximize
[02:12:11.460 --> 02:12:15.740]   your performance in this 20 second maximal burst
[02:12:15.740 --> 02:12:17.900]   and your strategy for that was to make sure
[02:12:17.900 --> 02:12:20.580]   your muscle glycogen is saturated,
[02:12:20.580 --> 02:12:22.700]   it's probably not gonna help a ton
[02:12:22.700 --> 02:12:24.820]   'cause you're not going to be limited by total fuel.
[02:12:24.820 --> 02:12:27.620]   You're going to be limited by your ability to buffer acid.
[02:12:27.620 --> 02:12:31.460]   However, storing more glycogen in your muscle
[02:12:31.460 --> 02:12:33.020]   in preparation for a marathon
[02:12:33.020 --> 02:12:35.260]   is a tremendously effective strategy
[02:12:35.260 --> 02:12:37.860]   because that will become a limiting factor.
[02:12:37.860 --> 02:12:40.020]   So what we can do actually next, if you'd like,
[02:12:40.020 --> 02:12:41.420]   is we can just walk through these
[02:12:41.420 --> 02:12:43.500]   and look at the individual limitations
[02:12:43.500 --> 02:12:45.220]   where the failure point happens,
[02:12:45.220 --> 02:12:48.420]   and then that effectively will outline your strategy
[02:12:48.420 --> 02:12:49.660]   for improving them.
[02:12:49.660 --> 02:12:52.060]   - So you taught us about carbohydrate utilization
[02:12:52.060 --> 02:12:53.780]   as a fuel source.
[02:12:53.780 --> 02:12:56.300]   What about fat and what about protein?
[02:12:56.300 --> 02:12:59.580]   - Great, I'll start with protein because it's easy.
[02:12:59.580 --> 02:13:04.620]   It is generally at best going to represent 10%
[02:13:04.620 --> 02:13:05.860]   of your energy output.
[02:13:05.860 --> 02:13:08.980]   Now that will grow over time in terms of
[02:13:08.980 --> 02:13:12.180]   if you did a several hour amount of exercise.
[02:13:12.180 --> 02:13:13.260]   When you started doing it,
[02:13:13.260 --> 02:13:15.940]   you might be using 5% of your energy from protein
[02:13:15.940 --> 02:13:18.860]   and then that might grow to 10 or so.
[02:13:18.860 --> 02:13:21.220]   And that happens because you start running low
[02:13:21.220 --> 02:13:22.660]   on muscle glycogen.
[02:13:22.660 --> 02:13:25.620]   You start running low on liver glycogen.
[02:13:25.620 --> 02:13:28.340]   You start then having to pull in energy from another place.
[02:13:28.340 --> 02:13:30.060]   So like as those numbers go down,
[02:13:30.060 --> 02:13:33.860]   you'll see an increased uptick of energy from fat
[02:13:33.860 --> 02:13:34.900]   as well as protein.
[02:13:34.900 --> 02:13:38.900]   Having said that, it's not a tremendous fuel source.
[02:13:38.900 --> 02:13:40.700]   It is only aerobic.
[02:13:40.700 --> 02:13:42.380]   So it has to be oxidized.
[02:13:42.380 --> 02:13:43.780]   Those are the same thing.
[02:13:43.780 --> 02:13:47.580]   When I say oxidized, you use oxygen to burn something
[02:13:47.580 --> 02:13:49.340]   to make a fuel.
[02:13:49.340 --> 02:13:52.300]   So it's not a significant contributor to energy
[02:13:52.300 --> 02:13:55.620]   in that regard unless you're talking ultra marathons
[02:13:55.620 --> 02:13:57.680]   or longer and it is also not something
[02:13:57.680 --> 02:13:59.960]   that can enhance performance.
[02:13:59.960 --> 02:14:01.980]   And so we don't really need to talk much more about it
[02:14:01.980 --> 02:14:03.180]   than that.
[02:14:03.180 --> 02:14:05.680]   In terms of fat as a fuel source,
[02:14:05.680 --> 02:14:08.280]   now here's the fundamental difference.
[02:14:08.280 --> 02:14:11.420]   While carbohydrate starts anaerobically
[02:14:11.420 --> 02:14:14.340]   and finishes aerobically in the mitochondria,
[02:14:14.340 --> 02:14:16.500]   you're using mostly the carbohydrate
[02:14:16.500 --> 02:14:19.420]   in the exercising muscle tissue.
[02:14:19.420 --> 02:14:21.300]   Eventually you can pull from blood
[02:14:21.300 --> 02:14:22.640]   and then you can pull from the liver.
[02:14:22.640 --> 02:14:26.180]   With fat, you have a tiny amount stored in the muscle,
[02:14:26.180 --> 02:14:27.580]   intramuscular triglycerides.
[02:14:27.580 --> 02:14:31.360]   But the overwhelming majority of fuel you get from fat
[02:14:31.360 --> 02:14:33.500]   comes systemically.
[02:14:33.500 --> 02:14:34.820]   And so now we have a fundamental difference.
[02:14:34.820 --> 02:14:38.040]   We actually literally have a time problem.
[02:14:38.040 --> 02:14:40.580]   I can get energy from carbohydrates faster
[02:14:40.580 --> 02:14:41.900]   because it is directly there.
[02:14:41.900 --> 02:14:43.620]   If I go to pull it from fat,
[02:14:43.620 --> 02:14:45.540]   I've gotta pull it from the rest of the body,
[02:14:45.540 --> 02:14:48.640]   which is why somebody who loses fat
[02:14:48.640 --> 02:14:50.720]   loses it from their entire body,
[02:14:50.720 --> 02:14:53.460]   despite the fact that they may be only exercising
[02:14:53.460 --> 02:14:54.300]   a couple of parts.
[02:14:54.300 --> 02:14:56.080]   So think about a runner,
[02:14:56.080 --> 02:14:58.420]   someone who lost a lot of fat running.
[02:14:58.420 --> 02:15:00.900]   You don't see them just lose fat in their legs.
[02:15:00.900 --> 02:15:03.160]   It comes from their face and their neck and everywhere.
[02:15:03.160 --> 02:15:04.000]   Why?
[02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:05.300]   Because what you're going to do is pull fat
[02:15:05.300 --> 02:15:07.380]   from the entire system.
[02:15:07.380 --> 02:15:08.460]   You're going to break it down
[02:15:08.460 --> 02:15:10.700]   through a process called lipolysis,
[02:15:10.700 --> 02:15:13.140]   which means you break it down from the stored form.
[02:15:13.140 --> 02:15:15.480]   You put it in the blood as that glycerol backbone,
[02:15:15.480 --> 02:15:17.860]   which is that three carbon backbone
[02:15:17.860 --> 02:15:19.620]   in the individual fatty acids.
[02:15:19.620 --> 02:15:20.780]   It's going to float through the blood.
[02:15:20.780 --> 02:15:22.200]   There's a seven step system here,
[02:15:22.200 --> 02:15:23.780]   but we'll skip it for now.
[02:15:23.780 --> 02:15:26.500]   It's going to have to get then uptaken into the muscle.
[02:15:26.500 --> 02:15:28.220]   In the muscle then it has to get taken up
[02:15:28.220 --> 02:15:29.900]   and run into the mitochondria.
[02:15:29.900 --> 02:15:34.180]   Now that backbone, that three carbon glycerol backbone
[02:15:34.180 --> 02:15:36.060]   is actually going to function almost exactly
[02:15:36.060 --> 02:15:37.940]   like the three carbon pyruvate.
[02:15:37.940 --> 02:15:40.940]   Just get it into the mitochondria, cleave off one carbon,
[02:15:40.940 --> 02:15:43.140]   run it as acetyl-CoA, bada bing, bada boom.
[02:15:43.140 --> 02:15:45.420]   Exact same thing, super easy to metabolize,
[02:15:45.420 --> 02:15:48.220]   small enough to go through the mitochondria membrane.
[02:15:48.220 --> 02:15:51.060]   The fatty acid chains become a problem.
[02:15:51.060 --> 02:15:53.860]   So if you have a chain that's longer
[02:15:53.860 --> 02:15:56.380]   than our eight or so carbons,
[02:15:56.380 --> 02:15:58.700]   it has to actually go through a special transporter
[02:15:58.700 --> 02:16:00.200]   on the cell wall to get in.
[02:16:00.200 --> 02:16:03.420]   And that's going to be limited by a thing called carnitine.
[02:16:03.420 --> 02:16:05.460]   And you're probably familiar with that as a supplement.
[02:16:05.460 --> 02:16:06.680]   You may have talked about it.
[02:16:06.680 --> 02:16:09.060]   There's a lot of places that make it.
[02:16:09.060 --> 02:16:11.100]   That's going to be a limiting factor.
[02:16:11.100 --> 02:16:14.320]   If it is a smaller, what we call a short chain,
[02:16:14.320 --> 02:16:16.780]   or even a medium chain, triglyceride,
[02:16:16.780 --> 02:16:19.020]   which a lot of folks have heard of MCT,
[02:16:19.020 --> 02:16:19.960]   that's what we're talking about,
[02:16:19.960 --> 02:16:21.900]   that can actually go directly through,
[02:16:21.900 --> 02:16:23.340]   'cause it's small enough to pass through,
[02:16:23.340 --> 02:16:25.620]   and you can use it immediately as an energy source.
[02:16:25.620 --> 02:16:29.540]   In either case, the way that you finally metabolize
[02:16:29.540 --> 02:16:32.460]   a fatty acid is a process where you would go through
[02:16:32.460 --> 02:16:35.300]   and cut off two carbons at a time.
[02:16:35.300 --> 02:16:37.300]   Why would you cut off two?
[02:16:37.300 --> 02:16:40.080]   Because you're trying to make that two carbon acetyl-CoA,
[02:16:40.080 --> 02:16:43.620]   so you can run through that Krebs cycle again.
[02:16:43.620 --> 02:16:46.040]   Because you're cutting off two carbons at a time,
[02:16:46.040 --> 02:16:49.420]   we have a special name for that oxidation process.
[02:16:49.420 --> 02:16:52.080]   It's called beta oxidation.
[02:16:52.080 --> 02:16:55.120]   That's exactly why we call it beta oxidation.
[02:16:55.120 --> 02:16:58.180]   Two carbons in, you cut it off to make that acetyl-CoA.
[02:16:58.180 --> 02:17:00.380]   So you can notice the oxidation pathway,
[02:17:00.380 --> 02:17:04.100]   the electron transport pathway, is identical,
[02:17:04.100 --> 02:17:07.080]   whether you're talking about the carbohydrates or the fat.
[02:17:07.080 --> 02:17:09.180]   In fact, it doesn't even matter.
[02:17:09.180 --> 02:17:12.620]   More to our point, if we're talking about simply fat loss,
[02:17:12.620 --> 02:17:14.780]   it really just is about running
[02:17:14.780 --> 02:17:16.240]   that electron transport chain.
[02:17:16.240 --> 02:17:19.580]   Whether it came from a carbohydrate original source,
[02:17:19.580 --> 02:17:22.700]   or a fat original source, it ends up in the mitochondria
[02:17:22.700 --> 02:17:25.340]   as basically the exact same thing.
[02:17:25.340 --> 02:17:29.140]   It then ends the end of metabolism as the same thing.
[02:17:29.140 --> 02:17:33.260]   Remember, the final end point of carbohydrate metabolism
[02:17:33.260 --> 02:17:36.500]   is water, ATP, and CO2.
[02:17:36.500 --> 02:17:40.060]   Do you wanna guess the final end point of fat metabolism?
[02:17:40.060 --> 02:17:43.740]   It's water, ATP, and CO2.
[02:17:43.740 --> 02:17:48.560]   So, practical applications here.
[02:17:48.560 --> 02:17:51.220]   If you want to maximize fat loss,
[02:17:51.220 --> 02:17:52.880]   what type of training is best?
[02:17:52.880 --> 02:17:55.840]   It really doesn't matter.
[02:17:55.840 --> 02:17:58.640]   If you enjoy longer steady-state stuff, fantastic.
[02:17:58.640 --> 02:18:00.420]   If you enjoy intervals, amazing.
[02:18:00.420 --> 02:18:02.660]   If you would like to do a combination,
[02:18:02.660 --> 02:18:05.340]   that's my personal preference, that's great too.
[02:18:05.340 --> 02:18:07.500]   You have a ton of options.
[02:18:07.500 --> 02:18:10.580]   Pick what you think is a combination of challenging.
[02:18:10.580 --> 02:18:13.880]   Not all exercise should be easy,
[02:18:13.880 --> 02:18:15.500]   but you will actually enjoy somewhat,
[02:18:15.500 --> 02:18:17.700]   or you're willing to accept.
[02:18:17.700 --> 02:18:20.380]   And anything that you absolutely hate, don't do it.
[02:18:20.380 --> 02:18:23.320]   Sometimes it is very, very, very difficult
[02:18:23.320 --> 02:18:25.180]   to do high-intensity training.
[02:18:25.180 --> 02:18:26.700]   You have to really be interested in doing it.
[02:18:26.700 --> 02:18:27.620]   If not, it ends up turning
[02:18:27.620 --> 02:18:29.660]   into like moderate-intensity training.
[02:18:29.660 --> 02:18:31.300]   You sorta just check the box.
[02:18:31.300 --> 02:18:32.980]   And it doesn't work that well if you're just checking
[02:18:32.980 --> 02:18:33.880]   the box.
[02:18:33.880 --> 02:18:35.900]   So, if you're like, man, mentally, I don't have it
[02:18:35.900 --> 02:18:39.180]   in me today to get to a high heart rate and throw up
[02:18:39.180 --> 02:18:40.700]   and all that stuff, cool.
[02:18:40.700 --> 02:18:43.180]   But you can just do some moderate steady-state stuff,
[02:18:43.180 --> 02:18:44.320]   well, that's a win.
[02:18:44.320 --> 02:18:45.160]   Great.
[02:18:45.160 --> 02:18:47.680]   If you're like, oh my gosh, more than 10 straight minutes
[02:18:47.680 --> 02:18:51.160]   and I'm so bored, and you're all, maybe you're also like,
[02:18:51.160 --> 02:18:53.020]   I don't have 45 minutes, I gotta get this done
[02:18:53.020 --> 02:18:54.460]   in eight minutes, great.
[02:18:54.460 --> 02:18:56.340]   Go do some high-intensity intervals.
[02:18:56.340 --> 02:18:59.060]   Either option will be equally effective.
[02:18:59.060 --> 02:19:02.380]   - As you mentioned earlier, exercise is useful
[02:19:02.380 --> 02:19:07.180]   for aesthetic changes, functionality, and for longevity.
[02:19:07.180 --> 02:19:11.820]   But when thinking about exercise specifically for fat loss,
[02:19:11.820 --> 02:19:15.020]   I do have to ask this question.
[02:19:15.020 --> 02:19:17.460]   I often hear from people that they prefer one type
[02:19:17.460 --> 02:19:20.820]   of exercise versus another for sake of fat loss
[02:19:20.820 --> 02:19:24.880]   because certain forms of exercise make them very hungry.
[02:19:24.880 --> 02:19:26.800]   I'm wondering whether or not there's any relationship
[02:19:26.800 --> 02:19:29.460]   between the intensity or type of exercise
[02:19:29.460 --> 02:19:31.780]   and the hunger stimulus.
[02:19:31.780 --> 02:19:33.220]   Now, I don't have this problem
[02:19:33.220 --> 02:19:36.220]   because basically everything makes me hungry.
[02:19:36.220 --> 02:19:39.020]   And yet I'm also okay fasting for part of the day.
[02:19:39.020 --> 02:19:42.900]   I'm one of those pseudo intermittent fasters.
[02:19:42.900 --> 02:19:43.920]   Talk about what I mean by that,
[02:19:43.920 --> 02:19:48.460]   I just happen to eat between 11 a.m. and 8 p.m. naturally.
[02:19:48.460 --> 02:19:49.720]   I'm not religious about it,
[02:19:49.720 --> 02:19:52.820]   but I don't do it for any other reason,
[02:19:52.820 --> 02:19:54.460]   except that that tends to be when I'm hungry
[02:19:54.460 --> 02:19:58.420]   and I exercise outside of that in the morning typically.
[02:19:58.420 --> 02:20:04.080]   In any case, is there a way that people can determine
[02:20:04.080 --> 02:20:06.140]   what type of exercise might be better or worse for them
[02:20:06.140 --> 02:20:09.440]   based on its appetite stimulating or inhibiting effects?
[02:20:09.440 --> 02:20:13.300]   Because I also hear that some people will go for a long run
[02:20:13.300 --> 02:20:16.340]   and then they are "not hungry" for several hours afterwards.
[02:20:16.340 --> 02:20:18.560]   Does that have anything to do with which fuels
[02:20:18.560 --> 02:20:21.180]   are being utilized during different forms of exercise?
[02:20:21.180 --> 02:20:22.240]   - That's actually a really good question.
[02:20:22.240 --> 02:20:26.340]   I don't know the mechanisms that could explain that answer.
[02:20:26.340 --> 02:20:28.880]   What I can tell you is you hear the same comment
[02:20:28.880 --> 02:20:29.960]   for physical activity.
[02:20:29.960 --> 02:20:31.660]   In other words, people say,
[02:20:31.660 --> 02:20:32.980]   "Man, if I do this type of training,
[02:20:32.980 --> 02:20:34.660]   "then I just am exhausted
[02:20:34.660 --> 02:20:36.320]   "and I lay around the rest of the day.
[02:20:36.320 --> 02:20:39.060]   "So my total caloric expenditure is actually compromised
[02:20:39.060 --> 02:20:41.400]   "as an aggregate because I'm down."
[02:20:41.400 --> 02:20:44.840]   The data would suggest in general that doesn't happen.
[02:20:44.840 --> 02:20:46.760]   So most of the time we don't see a reduction
[02:20:46.760 --> 02:20:50.240]   in physical activity with either high intensity
[02:20:50.240 --> 02:20:51.480]   or steady state training.
[02:20:51.480 --> 02:20:54.780]   In fact, you generally see equal, if not increased,
[02:20:54.780 --> 02:20:55.820]   what's called need.
[02:20:55.820 --> 02:20:58.580]   So it's the non-exercising part of your day
[02:20:58.580 --> 02:21:00.580]   in addition to the basal metabolic rate.
[02:21:00.580 --> 02:21:02.580]   So physical activity wise, you don't want it to be proper.
[02:21:02.580 --> 02:21:04.980]   Now hunger is a little bit of a different thing.
[02:21:04.980 --> 02:21:07.860]   The answer here is I don't think we have time
[02:21:07.860 --> 02:21:09.900]   to actually do justice on this.
[02:21:09.900 --> 02:21:13.140]   So perhaps best to not get into this one.
[02:21:13.140 --> 02:21:14.940]   - Yeah, why don't we punt this down the road
[02:21:14.940 --> 02:21:17.940]   to our discussion about nutrition specifically
[02:21:17.940 --> 02:21:19.020]   and weave back to it.
[02:21:19.020 --> 02:21:21.240]   So we'll earmark it for that.
[02:21:21.240 --> 02:21:24.260]   Meanwhile, it sounds like if one is thinking purely
[02:21:24.260 --> 02:21:28.180]   in terms of burning calories
[02:21:28.180 --> 02:21:30.460]   and getting the health benefits of exercise
[02:21:30.460 --> 02:21:34.140]   to create a caloric deficit, to create fat loss,
[02:21:34.140 --> 02:21:37.100]   it doesn't matter whether or not they burn those calories
[02:21:37.100 --> 02:21:39.620]   using a form of exercise that relies predominantly
[02:21:39.620 --> 02:21:42.740]   on carbohydrate, fat, or protein, correct?
[02:21:42.740 --> 02:21:43.900]   - It's not that it doesn't matter.
[02:21:43.900 --> 02:21:45.920]   It's that either one will work.
[02:21:45.920 --> 02:21:47.700]   Because when we say things like that,
[02:21:47.700 --> 02:21:50.380]   it doesn't mean they're actually identical.
[02:21:50.380 --> 02:21:51.860]   There are some slight differences
[02:21:51.860 --> 02:21:53.640]   and maybe those differences are important for some people
[02:21:53.640 --> 02:21:54.800]   and not others.
[02:21:54.800 --> 02:21:57.840]   I'd say it's either one is a viable strategy.
[02:21:57.840 --> 02:21:59.980]   - Great, what about protein as a fuel?
[02:21:59.980 --> 02:22:01.700]   - As an actual fuel.
[02:22:01.700 --> 02:22:03.100]   So let me give you an analogy.
[02:22:03.100 --> 02:22:06.960]   Imagine that you were with me a few weeks ago
[02:22:06.960 --> 02:22:10.800]   in Southern Montana and we were out in the wilderness
[02:22:10.800 --> 02:22:11.640]   for a week, okay?
[02:22:11.640 --> 02:22:14.680]   And it's cold out there and you needed to make a fire.
[02:22:14.680 --> 02:22:17.540]   And if I said, look, you can pick any of these things.
[02:22:17.540 --> 02:22:19.100]   There's some wood over there.
[02:22:19.100 --> 02:22:21.140]   We brought some newspaper and then we brought a match
[02:22:21.140 --> 02:22:22.700]   and we need to create a fire.
[02:22:22.700 --> 02:22:26.100]   We're gonna use that fire to energy and heat up.
[02:22:26.100 --> 02:22:27.280]   Okay, I said, great.
[02:22:27.280 --> 02:22:29.260]   The very first place you would probably start
[02:22:29.260 --> 02:22:30.960]   to make that fire is the match.
[02:22:30.960 --> 02:22:33.020]   You light the match and any match,
[02:22:33.020 --> 02:22:34.440]   hey, it's gonna light immediately,
[02:22:34.440 --> 02:22:37.780]   but it's probably gonna last five to 20 seconds,
[02:22:37.780 --> 02:22:39.560]   I don't know, before it burns out.
[02:22:39.560 --> 02:22:40.760]   That's fossil creatine.
[02:22:40.760 --> 02:22:43.360]   Real fast, real burns out.
[02:22:43.360 --> 02:22:46.300]   If you were smart, you would take that match
[02:22:46.300 --> 02:22:48.860]   and then light the newspaper on fire, right?
[02:22:48.860 --> 02:22:51.100]   Now, if you were to burn a whole newspaper,
[02:22:51.100 --> 02:22:53.980]   it is more energy, then you get to the match,
[02:22:53.980 --> 02:22:55.240]   but you still, you know, I don't know,
[02:22:55.240 --> 02:22:56.760]   what's it gonna take, a few minutes?
[02:22:56.760 --> 02:22:58.360]   Some number of minutes before an entire newspaper--
[02:22:58.360 --> 02:22:59.380]   - Say five minutes. - Burns up?
[02:22:59.380 --> 02:23:00.460]   Yeah, five, I don't know, right?
[02:23:00.460 --> 02:23:03.340]   Depends on the, yeah, which type of newspaper it is,
[02:23:03.340 --> 02:23:04.180]   I guess, right?
[02:23:04.180 --> 02:23:05.440]   Amazing.
[02:23:05.440 --> 02:23:07.960]   That's carbohydrate, right?
[02:23:07.960 --> 02:23:10.280]   If you were really smart, you would use that
[02:23:10.280 --> 02:23:12.120]   to then light a piece of wood on fire.
[02:23:12.120 --> 02:23:13.960]   And a wood, if you've been in the wilderness,
[02:23:13.960 --> 02:23:15.820]   it could last hours, days.
[02:23:15.820 --> 02:23:17.460]   It's really quite unlimited.
[02:23:17.460 --> 02:23:22.120]   Your phosphocreatine storage is very limited, small.
[02:23:22.120 --> 02:23:25.080]   Glycogen is a lot higher, 'cause you can store it in muscle,
[02:23:25.080 --> 02:23:26.280]   you can store it in other places,
[02:23:26.280 --> 02:23:28.040]   so you have more, but not a lot.
[02:23:28.040 --> 02:23:29.360]   Fat is unlimited.
[02:23:29.360 --> 02:23:32.280]   The average person, if you're around, say, 70 kilos,
[02:23:32.280 --> 02:23:36.160]   up 170 pounds or so, and you're moderately lean,
[02:23:36.160 --> 02:23:38.660]   maybe 15% body fat, nothing crazy.
[02:23:38.660 --> 02:23:41.660]   You probably have enough stored fat
[02:23:41.660 --> 02:23:45.860]   to create enough energy to survive for more than 30 days.
[02:23:46.720 --> 02:23:47.800]   Right, this would literally be,
[02:23:47.800 --> 02:23:50.120]   if you ingested zero calories,
[02:23:50.120 --> 02:23:52.600]   you have enough fuel in your stored fat
[02:23:52.600 --> 02:23:55.000]   to keep you alive for certainly 30 days.
[02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:57.700]   You wouldn't feel good and all those things.
[02:23:57.700 --> 02:24:02.700]   But energetically, basically, fat will never,
[02:24:02.700 --> 02:24:05.960]   ever be your limiting factor to performance.
[02:24:05.960 --> 02:24:06.880]   So when we start talking about,
[02:24:06.880 --> 02:24:08.960]   well, what limits my performance in these areas,
[02:24:08.960 --> 02:24:10.820]   you can just wipe fat off the list.
[02:24:10.820 --> 02:24:12.960]   It will never be your limiting factor
[02:24:12.960 --> 02:24:14.200]   to any type of endurance performance.
[02:24:14.200 --> 02:24:16.320]   You simply have way too much.
[02:24:16.320 --> 02:24:20.720]   The only problem with fat is it's just too slow.
[02:24:20.720 --> 02:24:22.800]   I've gotta mobilize it, I've gotta get in the blood,
[02:24:22.800 --> 02:24:25.000]   move it, that whole thing, too slow.
[02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:27.280]   So if I wanna go faster, I will never be able
[02:24:27.280 --> 02:24:31.260]   to fully utilize fat, which is why we talked about earlier.
[02:24:31.260 --> 02:24:33.400]   You'll never see a situation in which somebody
[02:24:33.400 --> 02:24:37.640]   is 100% burning fat as a fuel and no percent carbohydrate.
[02:24:37.640 --> 02:24:40.040]   It's always going to be too slow.
[02:24:40.040 --> 02:24:42.840]   Highest you'll get, maybe 70 or so percent.
[02:24:42.840 --> 02:24:45.640]   Protein in this equation is none of that.
[02:24:45.640 --> 02:24:50.160]   Now, you may notice, how do you make paper?
[02:24:50.160 --> 02:24:51.080]   - What's fibrous?
[02:24:51.080 --> 02:24:55.920]   You combine it with water, it gets pressed, it compressed.
[02:24:55.920 --> 02:24:57.760]   - Yeah, it's made from wood.
[02:24:57.760 --> 02:25:00.280]   How do you make a match?
[02:25:00.280 --> 02:25:01.280]   It's made from wood.
[02:25:01.280 --> 02:25:03.840]   What's carbohydrate?
[02:25:03.840 --> 02:25:04.960]   A chain of carbon.
[02:25:04.960 --> 02:25:06.240]   What's fat?
[02:25:06.240 --> 02:25:07.640]   A chain of carbon.
[02:25:07.640 --> 02:25:09.860]   These are similar molecules, right?
[02:25:09.860 --> 02:25:11.800]   They're meant to give you pros and cons.
[02:25:11.800 --> 02:25:14.280]   It's very difficult to just light a log on fire
[02:25:14.280 --> 02:25:16.080]   without a lot of work, you'd have to burn,
[02:25:16.080 --> 02:25:17.200]   burn, burn, burn, burn.
[02:25:17.200 --> 02:25:18.800]   So these are complimentary systems
[02:25:18.800 --> 02:25:21.340]   that are really close to the same thing.
[02:25:21.340 --> 02:25:24.040]   Protein is none of those things.
[02:25:24.040 --> 02:25:26.680]   Protein is more like a piece of metal.
[02:25:26.680 --> 02:25:27.900]   So if you were out in the woods with me
[02:25:27.900 --> 02:25:29.300]   and we were trying to make a fire and you're like,
[02:25:29.300 --> 02:25:33.040]   "Hey, look, I found some old railroad over there.
[02:25:33.040 --> 02:25:33.880]   Let's throw that on there."
[02:25:33.880 --> 02:25:35.440]   I would probably look at you like crazy.
[02:25:35.440 --> 02:25:38.480]   Now, technically, can you melt metal?
[02:25:38.480 --> 02:25:41.700]   Sure, but you're gonna burn a lot of energy
[02:25:41.700 --> 02:25:43.940]   to try to get a little bit back out of the metal
[02:25:43.940 --> 02:25:45.480]   and now you've also cost yourself
[02:25:45.480 --> 02:25:48.620]   a very, very valuable structure.
[02:25:48.620 --> 02:25:51.920]   So protein is a fuel source for exercise or metabolism.
[02:25:51.920 --> 02:25:53.840]   It's just an incredibly poor choice.
[02:25:53.840 --> 02:25:57.160]   Your body will do it, again, maybe five to 10%,
[02:25:57.160 --> 02:25:59.480]   but now you're burning a very valuable supply
[02:25:59.480 --> 02:26:01.040]   in a situation in which you don't know
[02:26:01.040 --> 02:26:03.020]   where there's ever gonna be anymore.
[02:26:03.020 --> 02:26:04.960]   Remember, protein is fairly transient.
[02:26:04.960 --> 02:26:06.420]   It's not very good at storing it.
[02:26:06.420 --> 02:26:08.880]   You can store a ton of carbohydrate
[02:26:08.880 --> 02:26:12.320]   and an unlimited, literally, amount of fat.
[02:26:12.320 --> 02:26:14.680]   So you just really need to disregard
[02:26:14.680 --> 02:26:17.300]   thinking about protein as a fuel source.
[02:26:17.300 --> 02:26:18.580]   Your body does not wanna do it.
[02:26:18.580 --> 02:26:20.100]   You're not good at it.
[02:26:20.100 --> 02:26:22.560]   You can go through a process of gluconeogenesis
[02:26:22.560 --> 02:26:25.200]   from protein, make glucose from it.
[02:26:25.200 --> 02:26:27.080]   It's just very poor.
[02:26:27.080 --> 02:26:29.840]   You're not gonna get much out of the exchange
[02:26:29.840 --> 02:26:32.800]   and you've burned your supply of metal,
[02:26:32.800 --> 02:26:34.960]   which is gonna be very difficult.
[02:26:34.960 --> 02:26:36.740]   It's a very high commodity in the woods
[02:26:36.740 --> 02:26:39.560]   or the wilderness to have something like metal.
[02:26:39.560 --> 02:26:41.940]   - For people that consume very low carbohydrate
[02:26:41.940 --> 02:26:43.960]   or zero carbohydrate diets,
[02:26:43.960 --> 02:26:48.500]   are they pulling more energy from muscle,
[02:26:48.500 --> 02:26:50.640]   which I imagine is a conversion of amino acids
[02:26:50.640 --> 02:26:52.460]   into ready carbon chains?
[02:26:52.460 --> 02:26:54.140]   - Yeah, I mean, in this particular case,
[02:26:54.140 --> 02:26:57.680]   once you've reached a certain level of adaptation,
[02:26:57.680 --> 02:27:00.640]   you've just gotten extremely good at generating glucose
[02:27:00.640 --> 02:27:02.220]   from other fashions, right?
[02:27:02.220 --> 02:27:05.520]   So you can bias heavily towards fat adaptation.
[02:27:05.520 --> 02:27:08.520]   The downside is, and we've seen this born in the literature,
[02:27:08.520 --> 02:27:10.040]   you're going to perform slower.
[02:27:10.920 --> 02:27:13.500]   So if you don't care about maximizing performance,
[02:27:13.500 --> 02:27:16.120]   especially over something where it is a maximal effort
[02:27:16.120 --> 02:27:17.740]   for a few minutes or something,
[02:27:17.740 --> 02:27:18.900]   then maybe you're not concerned.
[02:27:18.900 --> 02:27:19.940]   And that's absolutely great,
[02:27:19.940 --> 02:27:22.720]   especially for people just don't exercise.
[02:27:22.720 --> 02:27:24.860]   Then, hey, geez, very little concern here.
[02:27:24.860 --> 02:27:26.180]   But if you're interested in your performance
[02:27:26.180 --> 02:27:28.940]   and you're wondering why you're just like slugging it down,
[02:27:28.940 --> 02:27:31.700]   well, what you've done is you've down-regulated the ability,
[02:27:31.700 --> 02:27:33.200]   literally the enzymes responsible
[02:27:33.200 --> 02:27:36.640]   for that entire anaerobic glycolysis portion,
[02:27:36.640 --> 02:27:37.600]   they get down-regulated,
[02:27:37.600 --> 02:27:39.180]   which means there's not as much around anymore.
[02:27:39.180 --> 02:27:41.320]   And so you get really bad and slow
[02:27:41.320 --> 02:27:42.900]   at using carbohydrates as a fuel source.
[02:27:42.900 --> 02:27:44.600]   So it's a very poor strategy
[02:27:44.600 --> 02:27:46.840]   for people in an anaerobic-based sport
[02:27:46.840 --> 02:27:48.260]   or who like that type of activity.
[02:27:48.260 --> 02:27:50.140]   Again, if you don't care, no problem.
[02:27:50.140 --> 02:27:51.860]   If you don't exercise at all,
[02:27:51.860 --> 02:27:53.300]   then you really have no problem there,
[02:27:53.300 --> 02:27:56.340]   which is actually why a high-fat,
[02:27:56.340 --> 02:27:58.700]   low-carbohydrate nutrition strategy
[02:27:58.700 --> 02:28:00.980]   for people who don't do much physical activity
[02:28:00.980 --> 02:28:04.140]   is probably, well, it's very effective.
[02:28:04.140 --> 02:28:07.700]   It is a really good strategy for weight management,
[02:28:07.700 --> 02:28:09.700]   for energy stabilization throughout the day.
[02:28:09.700 --> 02:28:11.860]   And the research would very much support that.
[02:28:11.860 --> 02:28:13.460]   - In my observation, I would agree.
[02:28:13.460 --> 02:28:15.180]   I've tried low-carbohydrate diets
[02:28:15.180 --> 02:28:19.100]   of severely limiting or completely eliminating carbohydrate.
[02:28:19.100 --> 02:28:23.840]   And after about two or three days, I feel pretty lousy,
[02:28:23.840 --> 02:28:26.820]   but mostly because I want to train very intensely
[02:28:26.820 --> 02:28:27.900]   in the gym.
[02:28:27.900 --> 02:28:29.520]   In addition to doing longer runs,
[02:28:29.520 --> 02:28:31.900]   I tend to do all of those things across the week.
[02:28:31.900 --> 02:28:33.040]   - Yeah.
[02:28:33.040 --> 02:28:34.300]   - But I've also observed,
[02:28:34.300 --> 02:28:38.580]   and in fact know several people that love the
[02:28:38.580 --> 02:28:41.600]   very low-carbohydrate, AKA ketogenic type diet.
[02:28:41.600 --> 02:28:42.820]   They're not doing ketogenic diets
[02:28:42.820 --> 02:28:45.640]   for mental health reasons per se,
[02:28:45.640 --> 02:28:49.040]   but indeed those people tend to do very limited exercise
[02:28:49.040 --> 02:28:51.980]   or they tend to do a lot of long endurance,
[02:28:51.980 --> 02:28:54.380]   but low-intensity long endurance.
[02:28:54.380 --> 02:28:57.340]   These are the, I walk to get my exercise types,
[02:28:57.340 --> 02:28:58.900]   and they do indeed walk a lot.
[02:28:58.900 --> 02:29:01.220]   And some of them manage to control their weight
[02:29:01.220 --> 02:29:04.040]   very readily and like that diet for that reason.
[02:29:04.040 --> 02:29:06.000]   When we had Layne Norton on the podcast,
[02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:09.440]   he pointed out quite aptly that in order to lose weight,
[02:29:09.440 --> 02:29:10.600]   you have to restrict something,
[02:29:10.600 --> 02:29:13.640]   either time or macronutrients, et cetera,
[02:29:13.640 --> 02:29:17.000]   to arrive at that sub caloric threshold,
[02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:19.980]   get below the sub maintenance threshold.
[02:29:19.980 --> 02:29:22.280]   - I guess one of the things I want to point out is
[02:29:22.280 --> 02:29:25.280]   this should be used received as, again,
[02:29:25.280 --> 02:29:27.020]   not a this is better or worse.
[02:29:27.020 --> 02:29:30.000]   This is just, you now have a ton of options.
[02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:32.340]   So whatever personal preference, other factors,
[02:29:32.340 --> 02:29:36.260]   you get to craft this strategy of performance,
[02:29:36.260 --> 02:29:40.500]   aesthetics, and health based on your personal preferences.
[02:29:40.500 --> 02:29:43.740]   - At this point, I'd like to go back to our classic list
[02:29:43.740 --> 02:29:47.280]   of nine adaptations that exercise can induce.
[02:29:47.280 --> 02:29:51.420]   The first four, of course, being largely,
[02:29:51.420 --> 02:29:53.540]   largely unrelated to today's conversation,
[02:29:53.540 --> 02:29:56.220]   but that were covered in the episode
[02:29:56.220 --> 02:30:00.460]   that we did on strength, speed, and hypertrophy.
[02:30:00.460 --> 02:30:03.620]   So just to remind people, the nine adaptations
[02:30:03.620 --> 02:30:05.080]   are number one, skill and technique,
[02:30:05.080 --> 02:30:09.320]   two, speed, three, power, which is speed times force,
[02:30:09.320 --> 02:30:12.060]   four, strength, and five, hypertrophy.
[02:30:12.060 --> 02:30:13.920]   Today, we're talking about the remaining adaptations
[02:30:13.920 --> 02:30:17.340]   on that list, starting with muscular endurance,
[02:30:17.340 --> 02:30:20.340]   followed by anaerobic capacity,
[02:30:20.340 --> 02:30:23.340]   followed by maximal aerobic output,
[02:30:23.340 --> 02:30:27.540]   and finishing at number nine with long duration exercise.
[02:30:27.540 --> 02:30:30.940]   So if we could start with muscular endurance,
[02:30:30.940 --> 02:30:35.940]   this would be number six on the list of nine adaptations.
[02:30:35.940 --> 02:30:41.860]   Muscular endurance, how do I build muscular endurance?
[02:30:41.860 --> 02:30:44.220]   Why should I build muscular endurance?
[02:30:44.220 --> 02:30:48.260]   And just to remind me what fuel sources
[02:30:48.260 --> 02:30:53.260]   are predominating when I'm training for muscular endurance.
[02:30:53.260 --> 02:30:55.100]   - Great, so remember, muscular endurance
[02:30:55.100 --> 02:30:56.900]   is something that's going to be generally
[02:30:56.900 --> 02:30:58.660]   in a local muscle.
[02:30:58.660 --> 02:31:01.580]   It is not a cardiovascular or systemic issue,
[02:31:01.580 --> 02:31:03.500]   and it tends to be something in the neighborhood
[02:31:03.500 --> 02:31:08.260]   of, say, five to maybe even up to 50 repetitions.
[02:31:08.260 --> 02:31:10.320]   So this is, the classic example we'll give here
[02:31:10.320 --> 02:31:12.580]   is how many pushups can you do in a row?
[02:31:12.580 --> 02:31:14.300]   Most people are gonna land somewhere in that range,
[02:31:14.300 --> 02:31:15.140]   I just said.
[02:31:15.140 --> 02:31:16.500]   How many sit-ups can you do in a minute?
[02:31:16.500 --> 02:31:17.380]   How many pull-ups?
[02:31:17.380 --> 02:31:20.860]   How long can you hang on a bar as a dead hang?
[02:31:20.860 --> 02:31:22.340]   Things like that, that's muscular endurance.
[02:31:22.340 --> 02:31:25.360]   Muscular endurance is not a mile run
[02:31:25.360 --> 02:31:26.700]   or a marathon or anything like that.
[02:31:26.700 --> 02:31:31.460]   So how long can I stand without breaking posture?
[02:31:31.460 --> 02:31:32.660]   This is muscular endurance.
[02:31:32.660 --> 02:31:34.380]   - A plank, a wall sit?
[02:31:34.380 --> 02:31:35.640]   - Great, yes.
[02:31:35.640 --> 02:31:37.460]   Love all these things, okay?
[02:31:37.460 --> 02:31:40.260]   Now, the reason I took you on that big,
[02:31:40.260 --> 02:31:43.380]   long metabolism journey is so I could help you
[02:31:43.380 --> 02:31:46.860]   understand exactly how to train this factor,
[02:31:46.860 --> 02:31:49.980]   any of these factors, with a more comprehensive
[02:31:49.980 --> 02:31:51.000]   understanding of what's happening.
[02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:53.900]   Meaning, thinking back to the metabolism,
[02:31:53.900 --> 02:31:58.260]   if I'm gonna ask my triceps to do 50 pushups in a row,
[02:31:58.260 --> 02:32:00.020]   what's going to be my limiting factor?
[02:32:00.020 --> 02:32:02.100]   Am I gonna run out of fat?
[02:32:02.100 --> 02:32:03.380]   No chance.
[02:32:03.380 --> 02:32:06.500]   Am I going to run out of glycogen?
[02:32:06.500 --> 02:32:07.740]   No chance.
[02:32:07.740 --> 02:32:10.540]   That's way too few of repetitions.
[02:32:10.540 --> 02:32:11.740]   You have a lot left there.
[02:32:11.740 --> 02:32:13.340]   So what's gonna be the thing that stops me
[02:32:13.340 --> 02:32:15.660]   from getting 51 repetitions?
[02:32:15.660 --> 02:32:19.540]   Either you're gonna have too high of a pH rise,
[02:32:19.540 --> 02:32:21.260]   so too much acid buildup,
[02:32:23.660 --> 02:32:27.180]   or you're gonna have a problem clearing the waist.
[02:32:27.180 --> 02:32:29.380]   So really, this is two factors,
[02:32:29.380 --> 02:32:33.800]   dealing with acid buildup and getting acid out
[02:32:33.800 --> 02:32:35.700]   of the muscle tissue and in the circulation,
[02:32:35.700 --> 02:32:37.460]   'cause you have plenty of ability to handle
[02:32:37.460 --> 02:32:41.460]   that small amount of acid buildup in your entire body.
[02:32:41.460 --> 02:32:43.660]   It's just you can't handle it in that tiny spot.
[02:32:43.660 --> 02:32:46.700]   Now, I picked the tricep for a very specific reason.
[02:32:46.700 --> 02:32:49.140]   You're gonna deal with more pain
[02:32:49.140 --> 02:32:50.940]   when you use a large muscle group,
[02:32:50.940 --> 02:32:52.260]   like your quads or your glutes,
[02:32:52.260 --> 02:32:53.900]   than you are with a small muscle group.
[02:32:53.900 --> 02:32:58.220]   For example, nobody ever threw up after arm day,
[02:32:58.220 --> 02:33:00.860]   but a lot of people throw up after leg day.
[02:33:00.860 --> 02:33:01.960]   Why is that?
[02:33:01.960 --> 02:33:03.620]   Look at the total amount of waste
[02:33:03.620 --> 02:33:05.240]   that you're dumping into your system
[02:33:05.240 --> 02:33:08.460]   when you have quadrupled or 10X the muscle size.
[02:33:08.460 --> 02:33:10.940]   Small muscle groups are only really going
[02:33:10.940 --> 02:33:12.500]   to be challenged in that local area.
[02:33:12.500 --> 02:33:15.540]   Large ones will dump so much waste into the system
[02:33:15.540 --> 02:33:18.140]   that you'll wanna avoid that as quickly as possible,
[02:33:18.140 --> 02:33:20.500]   and that's one of the reasons why you throw up
[02:33:20.500 --> 02:33:22.100]   after a hard exercise.
[02:33:22.100 --> 02:33:25.780]   - Great, so the reason I'm laughing
[02:33:25.780 --> 02:33:28.860]   because I don't think I've ever thrown up
[02:33:28.860 --> 02:33:30.460]   from a weight training session,
[02:33:30.460 --> 02:33:33.460]   and so it's making me wonder if I've ever trained that hard.
[02:33:33.460 --> 02:33:36.920]   I've received or obtained the progress
[02:33:36.920 --> 02:33:38.940]   that I've wanted to generally over time,
[02:33:38.940 --> 02:33:41.720]   not every week, every workout, every month,
[02:33:41.720 --> 02:33:44.100]   but certainly over the 30 plus years
[02:33:44.100 --> 02:33:44.940]   that I've been weight training,
[02:33:44.940 --> 02:33:46.620]   I've achieved the results I've wanted.
[02:33:46.620 --> 02:33:51.260]   I have, however, vomited after a long run
[02:33:51.260 --> 02:33:54.660]   when I didn't hydrate well, or if I drank too much water.
[02:33:54.660 --> 02:33:56.340]   - Sure, oh, sure, too much water,
[02:33:56.340 --> 02:33:57.660]   yeah, you'll get that out quick.
[02:33:57.660 --> 02:33:58.940]   - Right, I just wanna be clear
[02:33:58.940 --> 02:34:00.360]   'cause I think some people are getting the picture
[02:34:00.360 --> 02:34:02.160]   that if they're not vomiting at the end
[02:34:02.160 --> 02:34:04.340]   after their leg workout that they're not training
[02:34:04.340 --> 02:34:06.140]   according to your standards.
[02:34:06.140 --> 02:34:08.980]   Again, by the way, Dr. Andy Galpin runs experiments
[02:34:08.980 --> 02:34:11.100]   in his lab, he's recruiting subjects all the time.
[02:34:11.100 --> 02:34:13.220]   (laughing)
[02:34:13.220 --> 02:34:15.140]   - Also known as my graduate students.
[02:34:15.140 --> 02:34:15.980]   - That's right.
[02:34:15.980 --> 02:34:17.820]   In any event, sorry to interrupt,
[02:34:17.820 --> 02:34:19.740]   but I felt it was a necessary interruption.
[02:34:19.740 --> 02:34:23.980]   So muscular endurance, there's plenty of fuel.
[02:34:23.980 --> 02:34:27.280]   - Plenty of fuel, you manage acid buildup,
[02:34:27.280 --> 02:34:29.060]   and you also need to get that fuel out of you.
[02:34:29.060 --> 02:34:31.420]   That's gonna be a capillarization issue.
[02:34:31.420 --> 02:34:32.940]   So the way that we can think about this
[02:34:32.940 --> 02:34:36.500]   is capillaries surround your muscle,
[02:34:36.500 --> 02:34:38.440]   and the whole point of them is so that blood
[02:34:38.440 --> 02:34:41.140]   can come into them, they hit this capillarization,
[02:34:41.140 --> 02:34:44.540]   that actually slows the diffusion rate of blood down,
[02:34:44.540 --> 02:34:46.700]   and so you can exchange nutrients in
[02:34:46.700 --> 02:34:48.660]   and get waste products out,
[02:34:48.660 --> 02:34:50.340]   and then we get things back into circulation.
[02:34:50.340 --> 02:34:52.060]   So the more of those you have,
[02:34:52.060 --> 02:34:54.280]   the better you are at dispersing
[02:34:54.280 --> 02:34:55.780]   any of these waste products buildup,
[02:34:55.780 --> 02:34:57.780]   whether it's CO2 or the acid.
[02:34:57.780 --> 02:34:59.500]   So the adaptation you're looking for here
[02:34:59.500 --> 02:35:00.900]   is an increase in capillarization,
[02:35:00.900 --> 02:35:04.000]   potentially a slight increase in mitochondria,
[02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:06.720]   but the time is too fast, right?
[02:35:06.720 --> 02:35:09.060]   So we're gonna be able to need to do these 50 repetitions
[02:35:09.060 --> 02:35:10.980]   in, say, under a minute or something like that.
[02:35:10.980 --> 02:35:13.540]   So getting the mobilization into the mitochondria,
[02:35:13.540 --> 02:35:15.900]   getting fuel that way, too slow.
[02:35:15.900 --> 02:35:18.240]   That's not really gonna get our performance here.
[02:35:18.240 --> 02:35:22.880]   So what are strategies to increase acid buffering ability
[02:35:22.880 --> 02:35:24.920]   and then capillarization?
[02:35:24.920 --> 02:35:26.500]   So on the capillarization side,
[02:35:26.500 --> 02:35:29.720]   you simply need to train at that ability.
[02:35:29.720 --> 02:35:32.220]   So you go close to failure and practice that often.
[02:35:32.220 --> 02:35:35.520]   That alone will increase blood flow to that local area,
[02:35:35.520 --> 02:35:37.820]   which will take you through your process
[02:35:37.820 --> 02:35:39.760]   of increase in capillarization.
[02:35:39.760 --> 02:35:41.860]   Easy peasy, specificity.
[02:35:41.860 --> 02:35:42.700]   That's my idea there.
[02:35:42.700 --> 02:35:47.300]   - Just to briefly interrupt, I find it remarkable,
[02:35:47.300 --> 02:35:48.560]   although not surprising,
[02:35:48.560 --> 02:35:51.660]   given how amazing the human body is,
[02:35:51.660 --> 02:35:54.800]   that simply by doing some movement repeat,
[02:35:54.800 --> 02:35:59.720]   like a wall sit or push-ups or dips for that matter,
[02:35:59.720 --> 02:36:01.140]   repeatedly over and over and over
[02:36:01.140 --> 02:36:03.940]   until you reach that failure point
[02:36:03.940 --> 02:36:07.740]   or that quaking point in the case of a wall sit,
[02:36:07.740 --> 02:36:10.860]   that provides a stimulus for more capillaries
[02:36:10.860 --> 02:36:12.540]   to be built into the system.
[02:36:12.540 --> 02:36:17.140]   Literally, the production or the trafficking
[02:36:17.140 --> 02:36:19.380]   of endothelial cells, which make up the capillaries
[02:36:19.380 --> 02:36:22.060]   and allow basically more little pipes
[02:36:22.060 --> 02:36:24.980]   to feed the system with oxygen and remove waste products.
[02:36:24.980 --> 02:36:26.120]   - It's like irrigation, right?
[02:36:26.120 --> 02:36:27.280]   Imagine you had a giant field
[02:36:27.280 --> 02:36:29.820]   and you had two big pipes running down the outside.
[02:36:29.820 --> 02:36:31.520]   Well, in fact, if you want to make sure water
[02:36:31.520 --> 02:36:33.740]   gets evenly dispersed across the entire field,
[02:36:33.740 --> 02:36:35.980]   you'll have a bunch of off-shooting little pipes.
[02:36:35.980 --> 02:36:38.880]   And the more of those you have, the more coverage you get.
[02:36:38.880 --> 02:36:44.260]   - Do we know what the specific signal is that says,
[02:36:44.260 --> 02:36:48.020]   "Hey, I failed at this, we need more capillaries."
[02:36:48.020 --> 02:36:49.580]   - I actually don't know what that is.
[02:36:49.580 --> 02:36:53.980]   I would speculate it's a combination of acidity
[02:36:53.980 --> 02:36:55.420]   as well as carbon dioxide
[02:36:55.420 --> 02:36:57.500]   and probably some nitric oxide stuff happening there,
[02:36:57.500 --> 02:36:58.800]   but I actually don't know.
[02:36:58.800 --> 02:37:00.580]   - I'm guessing nobody knows for sure
[02:37:00.580 --> 02:37:01.940]   because we still don't know, for instance,
[02:37:01.940 --> 02:37:04.220]   what the exact signal is for hypertrophy.
[02:37:04.220 --> 02:37:05.500]   It's kind of an amazing situation.
[02:37:05.500 --> 02:37:08.800]   We know the requirements for getting the result we want,
[02:37:08.800 --> 02:37:11.860]   but we still don't know what the specific signal is.
[02:37:11.860 --> 02:37:13.980]   In any event, what I'm hearing is
[02:37:13.980 --> 02:37:15.840]   building more capillaries is great
[02:37:15.840 --> 02:37:18.220]   for enhancing muscular endurance.
[02:37:18.220 --> 02:37:21.420]   And the way to get more capillaries into those muscles
[02:37:21.420 --> 02:37:24.460]   is to train for muscular endurance
[02:37:24.460 --> 02:37:27.580]   by getting close to failure or to some point
[02:37:27.580 --> 02:37:30.460]   where you simply can't continue for whatever reason.
[02:37:30.460 --> 02:37:31.940]   Could you give us an example
[02:37:31.940 --> 02:37:34.080]   of what a reasonable training protocol might be
[02:37:34.080 --> 02:37:39.080]   in terms of the classic Galpin list now of exercise choice,
[02:37:40.220 --> 02:37:45.220]   maybe a few options, order, volume, and frequency.
[02:37:45.220 --> 02:37:46.500]   - Great. - What should we be doing?
[02:37:46.500 --> 02:37:48.060]   How often should we be doing it?
[02:37:48.060 --> 02:37:50.900]   And for instance, should I do wall sits to failure,
[02:37:50.900 --> 02:37:52.540]   then pushups to failure?
[02:37:52.540 --> 02:37:54.980]   Given that this is a local process,
[02:37:54.980 --> 02:37:57.160]   I'm guessing that if I do pushups to failure,
[02:37:57.160 --> 02:37:58.660]   I'm not going to increase the number of capillaries
[02:37:58.660 --> 02:37:59.980]   in my legs very much.
[02:37:59.980 --> 02:38:01.020]   - Correct.
[02:38:01.020 --> 02:38:02.380]   So you nailed it.
[02:38:02.380 --> 02:38:04.520]   Exercise choice is high precision here.
[02:38:04.520 --> 02:38:09.420]   So pick the muscle group and the exact sequencing
[02:38:09.420 --> 02:38:12.100]   and movement pattern you want.
[02:38:12.100 --> 02:38:13.740]   High precision, this is the thing.
[02:38:13.740 --> 02:38:15.380]   If you want to get better at a plank, hold a plank.
[02:38:15.380 --> 02:38:17.220]   If you want to do more pushups, do more pushups.
[02:38:17.220 --> 02:38:20.180]   You can do some other stuff that's complimentary,
[02:38:20.180 --> 02:38:21.920]   but really this is a high precision game.
[02:38:21.920 --> 02:38:23.900]   Do the exact same thing for exercise choice.
[02:38:23.900 --> 02:38:25.460]   Very simple there.
[02:38:25.460 --> 02:38:27.820]   - Okay, in terms of exercise order,
[02:38:27.820 --> 02:38:29.780]   I suppose this dovetails with volume.
[02:38:29.780 --> 02:38:32.940]   Can I combine training,
[02:38:32.940 --> 02:38:36.940]   let's say wall sits for my quads and nearby muscle groups,
[02:38:36.940 --> 02:38:39.900]   and then do pushups to failure,
[02:38:39.900 --> 02:38:43.920]   and then also do some sort of pulling exercise to failure?
[02:38:43.920 --> 02:38:44.760]   - Yep, absolutely.
[02:38:44.760 --> 02:38:46.140]   Again, pick the exercises you want,
[02:38:46.140 --> 02:38:48.100]   the movement patterns you want to do, and do them.
[02:38:48.100 --> 02:38:51.100]   The order almost doesn't matter with the one caveat.
[02:38:51.100 --> 02:38:52.840]   With larger muscle groups,
[02:38:52.840 --> 02:38:55.860]   particularly again, multiple leg activities,
[02:38:55.860 --> 02:38:59.640]   that will induce a small amount of systemic fatigue.
[02:38:59.640 --> 02:39:00.640]   And so if you, I guess,
[02:39:00.640 --> 02:39:03.860]   theoretically wanted to maximize your pushup number,
[02:39:03.860 --> 02:39:07.380]   and you did a whole bunch of, say, split squats,
[02:39:07.380 --> 02:39:08.660]   and you just did those,
[02:39:08.660 --> 02:39:13.240]   and you did lunges for a mile or something like that,
[02:39:13.240 --> 02:39:14.980]   you might actually slightly compromise.
[02:39:14.980 --> 02:39:17.200]   You might not, but you might slightly compromise
[02:39:17.200 --> 02:39:19.460]   your ability to do as many pullups in a row,
[02:39:19.460 --> 02:39:21.040]   or hold a bent over row or something like that.
[02:39:21.040 --> 02:39:23.380]   So if you really cared about that level,
[02:39:23.380 --> 02:39:24.500]   then you maybe want to do the one
[02:39:24.500 --> 02:39:25.480]   that's most important first.
[02:39:25.480 --> 02:39:26.980]   In general, my recommendation though
[02:39:26.980 --> 02:39:29.300]   is to do the bigger muscle group first.
[02:39:29.300 --> 02:39:34.300]   How many sets and how often should one perform training
[02:39:34.300 --> 02:39:37.660]   for muscular endurance, and when?
[02:39:37.660 --> 02:39:39.140]   - Now, the lovely part here
[02:39:39.140 --> 02:39:42.780]   is we've moved down the spectrum past hypertrophy.
[02:39:42.780 --> 02:39:44.540]   You don't need a lot of load here.
[02:39:44.540 --> 02:39:46.900]   In fact, the load only needs to be at
[02:39:46.900 --> 02:39:50.380]   or slightly above what you want to move.
[02:39:50.380 --> 02:39:54.180]   So if you want to get better at moving 50% of your one
[02:39:54.180 --> 02:39:56.980]   or at max, you don't really need to train much more than 50,
[02:39:56.980 --> 02:39:59.460]   maybe 55 or 60% of your one or max,
[02:39:59.460 --> 02:40:01.820]   because if you go higher than that,
[02:40:01.820 --> 02:40:03.960]   the repetition count's going to fall,
[02:40:03.960 --> 02:40:05.300]   and you're no longer going to be training
[02:40:05.300 --> 02:40:06.600]   muscular endurance.
[02:40:06.600 --> 02:40:09.140]   So you just need to stay right around that number
[02:40:09.140 --> 02:40:09.980]   that you want to work on.
[02:40:09.980 --> 02:40:12.600]   So again, if the target is doing more pullups,
[02:40:12.600 --> 02:40:15.940]   and assuming that you have the strength to do it,
[02:40:15.940 --> 02:40:18.280]   you check that box, you simply need to practice
[02:40:18.280 --> 02:40:21.400]   the repetition range that you want to be in.
[02:40:21.400 --> 02:40:22.480]   That's all it takes.
[02:40:22.480 --> 02:40:24.820]   You can repeat that a number of times,
[02:40:24.820 --> 02:40:29.320]   but because, remember, the volume is fairly low,
[02:40:29.320 --> 02:40:31.660]   the load is very, very low,
[02:40:31.660 --> 02:40:33.840]   you can actually repeat these quite frequently.
[02:40:33.840 --> 02:40:36.700]   So you won't get extremely sore from muscular endurance
[02:40:36.700 --> 02:40:39.020]   relative to traditional hypertrophy training,
[02:40:39.020 --> 02:40:40.700]   because the load is very, very light.
[02:40:40.700 --> 02:40:44.020]   So you can do these more frequently if you would like.
[02:40:44.020 --> 02:40:46.200]   - More frequently, such as?
[02:40:46.200 --> 02:40:48.360]   - You could do it three or four times a week, easy,
[02:40:48.360 --> 02:40:49.200]   if you would like.
[02:40:49.200 --> 02:40:50.040]   You don't necessarily need to.
[02:40:50.040 --> 02:40:53.780]   Three days a week per muscle group is probably fine here.
[02:40:53.780 --> 02:40:57.460]   If you wanted to do more sets on a given day
[02:40:57.460 --> 02:40:59.900]   and do less days, that would be fine.
[02:40:59.900 --> 02:41:01.760]   So if you wanted to do two days a week,
[02:41:01.760 --> 02:41:03.540]   and you, say, wanted to do,
[02:41:03.540 --> 02:41:05.920]   let's say you could do 25 pushups,
[02:41:05.920 --> 02:41:09.740]   and the goal is to get to 30 pushups, just as an example.
[02:41:09.740 --> 02:41:13.880]   You might say, okay, I'm gonna do sets of 17,
[02:41:13.880 --> 02:41:15.780]   and I'm gonna do three sets of that.
[02:41:15.780 --> 02:41:16.860]   I'm gonna do that three days a week.
[02:41:16.860 --> 02:41:18.820]   That's gonna build up quite a bit.
[02:41:18.820 --> 02:41:20.300]   Or you could say, look,
[02:41:20.300 --> 02:41:22.940]   I'm gonna do a set basically to failure.
[02:41:22.940 --> 02:41:27.260]   I'm gonna recover and do one or two sets at, say, 80%,
[02:41:27.260 --> 02:41:29.380]   and I'll do that twice a week.
[02:41:29.380 --> 02:41:30.620]   That's gonna push the pace pretty well.
[02:41:30.620 --> 02:41:33.180]   You're gonna have a lot of gains from that.
[02:41:33.180 --> 02:41:35.220]   - And again, this is not about hypertrophy.
[02:41:35.220 --> 02:41:37.220]   This is about muscular endurance.
[02:41:37.220 --> 02:41:40.620]   So I do wanna emphasize, and again, please correct me
[02:41:40.620 --> 02:41:42.860]   if I'm talking out of line here.
[02:41:42.860 --> 02:41:47.300]   I do wanna emphasize that, so we mentioned pull-ups.
[02:41:47.300 --> 02:41:52.300]   If you can't get 25 pull-ups, and you're doing 10,
[02:41:52.460 --> 02:41:53.780]   you're training for hypertrophy.
[02:41:53.780 --> 02:41:55.540]   You're not training for muscular endurance per se.
[02:41:55.540 --> 02:41:57.680]   - Well, remember, there's a big crossover here.
[02:41:57.680 --> 02:42:01.580]   So anytime we're talking past like 15 reps,
[02:42:01.580 --> 02:42:04.860]   we're technically in hypertrophy and muscular endurance.
[02:42:04.860 --> 02:42:06.940]   So here's the common mistake.
[02:42:06.940 --> 02:42:08.940]   I don't wanna get bulky.
[02:42:08.940 --> 02:42:12.060]   So I'm gonna go lighter and do more reps.
[02:42:12.060 --> 02:42:13.040]   - And then people grow.
[02:42:13.040 --> 02:42:14.580]   - And then you landed still right
[02:42:14.580 --> 02:42:16.000]   in the middle of hypertrophy range.
[02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:18.060]   So for people who are like, oh my gosh,
[02:42:18.060 --> 02:42:19.380]   every time I lift weights, I blow up,
[02:42:19.380 --> 02:42:21.400]   I go lighter, I do more reps.
[02:42:21.400 --> 02:42:22.920]   You're still right in the hypertrophy zone.
[02:42:22.920 --> 02:42:24.840]   - They'd actually be much better off training
[02:42:24.840 --> 02:42:27.320]   very, very heavy in the one to three rep range.
[02:42:27.320 --> 02:42:29.560]   They'd get really strong and they wouldn't grow much.
[02:42:29.560 --> 02:42:30.400]   - Exactly.
[02:42:30.400 --> 02:42:33.700]   - So tell me if this is a reasonable protocol
[02:42:33.700 --> 02:42:36.460]   for what I'm gonna call the typical person.
[02:42:36.460 --> 02:42:38.500]   In my mind, the typical person is somebody
[02:42:38.500 --> 02:42:41.220]   who hopefully is doing resistance training,
[02:42:41.220 --> 02:42:45.860]   hitting that 10 sets per muscle group per week minimum
[02:42:45.860 --> 02:42:50.500]   to maintain or build strength and hypertrophy.
[02:42:51.400 --> 02:42:54.520]   But is also doing some long duration training
[02:42:54.520 --> 02:42:55.760]   that we'll talk about in a little bit.
[02:42:55.760 --> 02:42:59.580]   Maybe throwing in a high intensity workout here or there,
[02:42:59.580 --> 02:43:02.840]   some sprints, maybe some plyometrics,
[02:43:02.840 --> 02:43:04.160]   some skill-based training,
[02:43:04.160 --> 02:43:05.700]   and doing a bunch of different things
[02:43:05.700 --> 02:43:08.800]   to be what I would call all around fit.
[02:43:08.800 --> 02:43:10.400]   They're not training for any specific event
[02:43:10.400 --> 02:43:13.140]   or trying to maximize any one of the nine adaptations
[02:43:13.140 --> 02:43:14.900]   to the exclusion of the others.
[02:43:16.180 --> 02:43:21.000]   That person decide, okay, after they do their longer run,
[02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:26.000]   they're gonna do a plank to max duration.
[02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:28.240]   They're gonna do a wall set to max duration,
[02:43:28.240 --> 02:43:30.280]   and they're gonna do pushups to max duration.
[02:43:30.280 --> 02:43:33.080]   And then also do that same workout
[02:43:33.080 --> 02:43:37.160]   before they do their high intensity interval training,
[02:43:37.160 --> 02:43:38.800]   some other point during the week,
[02:43:38.800 --> 02:43:41.480]   and then maybe even do it again
[02:43:41.480 --> 02:43:44.560]   on their so-called rest day.
[02:43:44.560 --> 02:43:46.740]   - Just a real quick five minutes.
[02:43:46.740 --> 02:43:48.880]   And in doing so, build more capillaries
[02:43:48.880 --> 02:43:50.600]   into the relevant muscle groups
[02:43:50.600 --> 02:43:52.900]   and build their muscular endurance
[02:43:52.900 --> 02:43:55.340]   without eating into their overall recovery too much.
[02:43:55.340 --> 02:43:56.180]   - Too much, yeah.
[02:43:56.180 --> 02:43:57.360]   So again, the nice part about this
[02:43:57.360 --> 02:43:59.080]   is they don't hammer you too much.
[02:43:59.080 --> 02:44:00.860]   You're not gonna get tremendously sore
[02:44:00.860 --> 02:44:02.400]   if you keep the load light.
[02:44:02.400 --> 02:44:03.480]   The only switch I would make there
[02:44:03.480 --> 02:44:06.200]   is I would probably do them after your interval
[02:44:06.200 --> 02:44:07.040]   rather than before.
[02:44:07.040 --> 02:44:09.200]   So you can make sure you keep quality there
[02:44:09.200 --> 02:44:11.560]   and you're not compromised by a local muscular endurance
[02:44:11.560 --> 02:44:14.440]   when you're actually trying to get a more systemic fatigue
[02:44:14.440 --> 02:44:16.940]   with something like a higher intensity interval training.
[02:44:16.940 --> 02:44:18.820]   So that would work fantastic.
[02:44:18.820 --> 02:44:21.020]   The only other variable we haven't hit on here
[02:44:21.020 --> 02:44:22.440]   is progression.
[02:44:22.440 --> 02:44:23.680]   And this is very simple.
[02:44:23.680 --> 02:44:27.060]   Try to add a rep or two per week.
[02:44:27.060 --> 02:44:28.220]   That's really all you have to go after.
[02:44:28.220 --> 02:44:30.120]   So if you're up to 22 this week,
[02:44:30.120 --> 02:44:32.080]   try to hit 23 next week.
[02:44:32.080 --> 02:44:34.360]   - For wall sets and planks, that would be add time.
[02:44:34.360 --> 02:44:35.260]   - Time, yep.
[02:44:35.260 --> 02:44:37.600]   And if you run into a wall there,
[02:44:37.600 --> 02:44:40.700]   just like the same concepts we talked about
[02:44:40.700 --> 02:44:42.120]   with strength and hypertrophy,
[02:44:42.120 --> 02:44:45.880]   back it down to more like in the 80 or 85% range
[02:44:45.880 --> 02:44:48.600]   and accumulate a lot more practice.
[02:44:48.600 --> 02:44:50.680]   That's gonna help a lot with capitalization
[02:44:50.680 --> 02:44:52.060]   as well as acid buffering.
[02:44:52.060 --> 02:44:53.960]   So you're gonna continue to give yourself signals
[02:44:53.960 --> 02:44:58.280]   for upregulation of the processes needed for that.
[02:44:58.280 --> 02:45:00.260]   And it's not always pushing you to the end of failure.
[02:45:00.260 --> 02:45:02.340]   Just like we don't wanna always go to failure with strength.
[02:45:02.340 --> 02:45:03.660]   We don't wanna always go to failure
[02:45:03.660 --> 02:45:05.400]   with high intensity intervals either.
[02:45:05.400 --> 02:45:07.360]   Same thing would be happening here.
[02:45:07.360 --> 02:45:09.560]   - What about anaerobic capacity?
[02:45:09.560 --> 02:45:12.600]   How should people train for anaerobic capacity?
[02:45:12.600 --> 02:45:14.680]   What exactly are they training for?
[02:45:14.680 --> 02:45:17.920]   Meaning what is the structural or cellular adaptation
[02:45:17.920 --> 02:45:19.120]   or adaptations that are occurring
[02:45:19.120 --> 02:45:21.800]   that allow for increases in anaerobic capacity?
[02:45:21.800 --> 02:45:25.840]   And why are increases in anaerobic capacity good for us?
[02:45:25.840 --> 02:45:29.880]   Even if we're a quote unquote endurance athlete
[02:45:29.880 --> 02:45:32.640]   or we are a recreational exerciser
[02:45:32.640 --> 02:45:35.760]   who is not interested in building more muscle speed
[02:45:35.760 --> 02:45:37.320]   or things that I typically associate
[02:45:37.320 --> 02:45:38.960]   with anaerobic capacity.
[02:45:38.960 --> 02:45:40.840]   - Yeah, so this is really, really fun.
[02:45:40.840 --> 02:45:45.940]   Remember anaerobic capacity is the total amount of work
[02:45:45.940 --> 02:45:49.400]   you can do for something like seconds to a few minutes.
[02:45:49.400 --> 02:45:51.640]   And this is extremely high levels of fatigue.
[02:45:51.640 --> 02:45:53.280]   The highest you're really going to see.
[02:45:53.280 --> 02:45:57.540]   And by fatigue here, I mean acid buildup byproducts.
[02:45:57.540 --> 02:45:59.120]   Not fatigue as in like mentally,
[02:45:59.120 --> 02:46:00.840]   I don't wanna do this anymore.
[02:46:00.840 --> 02:46:03.520]   So if we just think about the energetics for a second,
[02:46:03.520 --> 02:46:08.080]   I'm gonna do say, let's take a really easy example
[02:46:08.080 --> 02:46:12.040]   of people have done that thing where you'll go to the track
[02:46:12.040 --> 02:46:15.160]   and you sprint the straightaways and you walk the corners.
[02:46:15.160 --> 02:46:17.280]   Remember that sort of thing?
[02:46:17.280 --> 02:46:20.780]   Tabatas, 30 on, 30 off.
[02:46:20.780 --> 02:46:23.400]   Things like this, like this is what we're talking about
[02:46:23.400 --> 02:46:25.360]   in this kind of anaerobic capacity area.
[02:46:25.360 --> 02:46:28.840]   Now, here's what's gonna happen.
[02:46:28.840 --> 02:46:31.140]   Is fat going to be your limiting?
[02:46:31.140 --> 02:46:33.600]   No, we've already made that clear, right?
[02:46:33.600 --> 02:46:35.320]   What about carbohydrates?
[02:46:35.320 --> 02:46:38.480]   Well, if it's a single bout or two or three bouts,
[02:46:38.480 --> 02:46:39.400]   probably not.
[02:46:39.400 --> 02:46:41.120]   But if you're doing this for a long time,
[02:46:41.120 --> 02:46:44.840]   say you're gonna go 30 on, 30 off for 20 rounds,
[02:46:44.840 --> 02:46:46.520]   you may actually start reaching a point
[02:46:46.520 --> 02:46:48.780]   of running out of muscle glycogen.
[02:46:48.780 --> 02:46:51.280]   In any of those cases though,
[02:46:51.280 --> 02:46:54.500]   you're going to be running into an acid problem.
[02:46:54.500 --> 02:46:57.540]   If you were to continue to do this multiple repetitions,
[02:46:57.540 --> 02:47:00.400]   in addition to running low on muscle glycogen,
[02:47:00.400 --> 02:47:01.360]   you're also gonna start running
[02:47:01.360 --> 02:47:04.880]   into oxygen transportation problems
[02:47:04.880 --> 02:47:07.000]   because you're building up a lot of byproducts,
[02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:07.840]   you've gotta continue.
[02:47:07.840 --> 02:47:11.520]   You will actually cruise into aerobic glycolysis.
[02:47:11.520 --> 02:47:13.800]   This is exactly why the community
[02:47:13.800 --> 02:47:16.840]   that I have worked a lot with, professional fighters,
[02:47:16.840 --> 02:47:20.700]   very high level boxers, world champions, UFC fighters.
[02:47:20.700 --> 02:47:24.520]   It is a five minute round that you're going to do five times
[02:47:24.520 --> 02:47:25.800]   for world championship fights.
[02:47:25.800 --> 02:47:27.100]   You get one minute break in between.
[02:47:27.100 --> 02:47:30.320]   So imagine going like 30 on, 30 off for five minutes,
[02:47:30.320 --> 02:47:33.000]   getting a one minute break and doing that five times.
[02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:36.240]   Even though the individual bouts are 30 seconds long,
[02:47:36.240 --> 02:47:40.800]   the entire thing lasts so long, it is primarily aerobic.
[02:47:40.800 --> 02:47:42.460]   You have to have both capacities.
[02:47:42.460 --> 02:47:43.880]   You gotta get really high anaerobic.
[02:47:43.880 --> 02:47:46.440]   You also have to have a lot of aerobic going on.
[02:47:46.440 --> 02:47:49.420]   You're going to start running into limitations
[02:47:49.420 --> 02:47:52.320]   because of heart rate, stroke volume,
[02:47:52.320 --> 02:47:55.200]   and then even potentially ventilation.
[02:47:55.200 --> 02:47:57.120]   The need for oxygen to be able to come in
[02:47:57.120 --> 02:48:00.960]   and clear the carbon dioxide totally out of the system
[02:48:00.960 --> 02:48:02.680]   becomes a problem because not only
[02:48:02.680 --> 02:48:05.280]   are you having so much buildup for such a long time,
[02:48:05.280 --> 02:48:07.640]   you're also using multiple muscle groups.
[02:48:07.640 --> 02:48:09.440]   So now this is a very important distinction.
[02:48:09.440 --> 02:48:12.280]   Muscular endurance tends to be localized.
[02:48:12.280 --> 02:48:14.080]   This is not.
[02:48:14.080 --> 02:48:16.240]   If you're doing these intervals, you're on an assault bike,
[02:48:16.240 --> 02:48:18.760]   you're sprinting up a hill, you're grappling with somebody,
[02:48:18.760 --> 02:48:20.320]   you have a lot of muscles being involved,
[02:48:20.320 --> 02:48:21.500]   which means all of that waste
[02:48:21.500 --> 02:48:23.300]   is being dumped into the central part.
[02:48:23.300 --> 02:48:24.280]   You have to clear it.
[02:48:24.280 --> 02:48:26.580]   And by clear it, I now mean not out of the muscle,
[02:48:26.580 --> 02:48:28.440]   I mean out of the body.
[02:48:28.440 --> 02:48:30.540]   So your ability to bring in and utilize oxygen
[02:48:30.540 --> 02:48:33.300]   is going to be a major limitation
[02:48:33.300 --> 02:48:34.900]   to your ability to handle this stuff.
[02:48:34.900 --> 02:48:36.000]   So what do you do?
[02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:39.500]   Well, specificity wins.
[02:48:39.500 --> 02:48:41.660]   Practice the exact thing you're talking about.
[02:48:41.660 --> 02:48:44.700]   So if you want to get better at sprinting the straightaways
[02:48:44.700 --> 02:48:46.800]   and walking the corners, do that.
[02:48:46.800 --> 02:48:49.540]   You can't always do it though.
[02:48:49.540 --> 02:48:50.820]   You're going to run into limitations.
[02:48:50.820 --> 02:48:54.060]   So this is when backing off to a lower intensity
[02:48:54.060 --> 02:48:55.440]   is going to give you a lot of benefits.
[02:48:55.440 --> 02:48:57.060]   We know very clearly
[02:48:57.060 --> 02:49:00.580]   if you want to improve cardiovascular fitness,
[02:49:00.580 --> 02:49:02.420]   high intensity, moderate intensity,
[02:49:02.420 --> 02:49:03.760]   and low intensity are effective.
[02:49:03.760 --> 02:49:05.420]   And you actually probably want to do
[02:49:05.420 --> 02:49:07.020]   a little bit of all of them.
[02:49:07.020 --> 02:49:09.100]   This is why none of our fighters
[02:49:09.100 --> 02:49:11.500]   would ever just do high intensity training.
[02:49:11.500 --> 02:49:13.820]   There's going to be some moderate.
[02:49:13.820 --> 02:49:16.900]   We tend to call this like cardiac output training.
[02:49:16.900 --> 02:49:18.900]   You can think of this as like anywhere
[02:49:18.900 --> 02:49:20.780]   between zone two to zone four.
[02:49:20.780 --> 02:49:23.500]   If you like zones, I don't use them personally.
[02:49:23.500 --> 02:49:26.760]   So I'm just going to intentionally interrupt you
[02:49:26.760 --> 02:49:29.920]   because this issue of zones has come up a few times.
[02:49:29.920 --> 02:49:32.220]   I want to make sure everybody's on the same page.
[02:49:32.220 --> 02:49:34.100]   You also mentioned that you don't necessarily
[02:49:34.100 --> 02:49:36.460]   favor the zone nomenclature.
[02:49:36.460 --> 02:49:41.460]   But for those not familiar, zone one, two, three, four,
[02:49:41.460 --> 02:49:46.540]   all the way up to five is a kind of back of the envelope
[02:49:46.540 --> 02:49:49.160]   type verbiage for some people
[02:49:49.160 --> 02:49:52.260]   and is more precisely followed for other people.
[02:49:52.260 --> 02:49:57.260]   Meaning for me, zone one is simply walking, easy walking.
[02:49:57.260 --> 02:50:02.040]   Zone two would be for anybody,
[02:50:02.040 --> 02:50:05.940]   the pace or intensity of exercise that one could perform
[02:50:05.940 --> 02:50:10.180]   while still maintaining a conversation, but just barely.
[02:50:10.180 --> 02:50:12.920]   Meaning if you were to push any harder,
[02:50:12.920 --> 02:50:16.600]   then it would be difficult to hold that conversation.
[02:50:16.600 --> 02:50:17.820]   Then you'd be in zone three.
[02:50:17.820 --> 02:50:21.040]   And then zone three, four, five, as I understand them,
[02:50:21.040 --> 02:50:24.480]   are a little bit vague, but maybe you could give us
[02:50:24.480 --> 02:50:27.080]   a sense of the breathing patterns associated
[02:50:27.080 --> 02:50:31.880]   with each of the zones so that people could map to those
[02:50:31.880 --> 02:50:34.600]   when we discuss zone one through five.
[02:50:34.600 --> 02:50:39.820]   And as I say all this, I certainly tip my hat
[02:50:39.820 --> 02:50:42.920]   to all of those people out there who like to measure
[02:50:42.920 --> 02:50:44.900]   percent of maximum heart rate.
[02:50:44.900 --> 02:50:47.100]   They like to use heart rate monitors.
[02:50:47.100 --> 02:50:49.140]   They're using any number of different devices.
[02:50:49.140 --> 02:50:51.280]   I sometimes use those devices, but in general,
[02:50:51.280 --> 02:50:54.120]   I tend not to, and I use my breathing as a rough guide
[02:50:54.120 --> 02:50:55.580]   of which zone I'm in.
[02:50:55.580 --> 02:50:58.460]   So before we go back to specific protocols
[02:50:58.460 --> 02:51:02.780]   for anaerobic capacity, tell me how you think about
[02:51:02.780 --> 02:51:05.840]   zone one through five and how people might be able to assess
[02:51:05.840 --> 02:51:08.960]   whether or not they are in zone one, two, three, or four,
[02:51:08.960 --> 02:51:09.800]   or five.
[02:51:09.800 --> 02:51:13.360]   - Great, so zone five is that absolute top thing,
[02:51:13.360 --> 02:51:14.620]   and we can flag ourselves there.
[02:51:14.620 --> 02:51:16.260]   I liked how you flagged one and two.
[02:51:16.260 --> 02:51:17.800]   The distinction between three, four, and five,
[02:51:17.800 --> 02:51:20.020]   I'm less concerned with either.
[02:51:20.020 --> 02:51:22.060]   We will do some heart rate stuff,
[02:51:22.060 --> 02:51:25.020]   but not to identify what zone we're in.
[02:51:25.020 --> 02:51:26.680]   The fact is the distinction between those zones
[02:51:26.680 --> 02:51:29.440]   is basically just made up, right?
[02:51:29.440 --> 02:51:33.060]   Not that it's fake, but there's no like rationale there.
[02:51:33.060 --> 02:51:36.140]   - It's a little bit like perceived effort in weightlifting.
[02:51:36.140 --> 02:51:39.060]   Are you at 100% output or 70%?
[02:51:39.060 --> 02:51:41.740]   You know when you're at zero and you know when you're
[02:51:41.740 --> 02:51:43.540]   at a hundred in that moment,
[02:51:43.540 --> 02:51:47.420]   but the difference between 60 and 70 is anybody's guess.
[02:51:47.420 --> 02:51:49.660]   - Totally, so we use, or the relevance, right?
[02:51:49.660 --> 02:51:51.960]   So why does it matter if I'm at 60 or 70?
[02:51:51.960 --> 02:51:52.880]   Is there actually a difference?
[02:51:52.880 --> 02:51:54.120]   There's not, right?
[02:51:54.120 --> 02:51:56.320]   So it doesn't really matter in that regard.
[02:51:56.320 --> 02:51:59.440]   If you're a very highly trained, particularly cyclist,
[02:51:59.440 --> 02:52:00.280]   things like that, then,
[02:52:00.280 --> 02:52:02.640]   and you can control a lot of circumstances,
[02:52:02.640 --> 02:52:04.720]   those things start to make a lot more sense.
[02:52:04.720 --> 02:52:05.960]   But when you're in an open environment
[02:52:05.960 --> 02:52:07.980]   like the athletes I deal with,
[02:52:07.980 --> 02:52:09.920]   it's just not gonna matter that much.
[02:52:09.920 --> 02:52:13.700]   So the way that I approach this is,
[02:52:13.700 --> 02:52:16.580]   and I will use this word intentionally, stolen,
[02:52:16.580 --> 02:52:21.360]   directly from Brian McKenzie and his company, Shift Adapt.
[02:52:21.360 --> 02:52:23.140]   They use what's called a gear system,
[02:52:23.140 --> 02:52:24.220]   and I absolutely love it.
[02:52:24.220 --> 02:52:26.300]   It's what we've been using for a long time.
[02:52:26.300 --> 02:52:27.620]   So with Brian, with your permission,
[02:52:27.620 --> 02:52:28.580]   I'm gonna take it right now.
[02:52:28.580 --> 02:52:29.900]   Thank you, Brian, you gave me the permission to stop.
[02:52:29.900 --> 02:52:30.740]   - Thank you, Brian.
[02:52:30.740 --> 02:52:32.920]   Brian's a good friend of ours.
[02:52:32.920 --> 02:52:36.780]   And I do think the breathing gear system is a terrific way
[02:52:36.780 --> 02:52:40.480]   to think about the zones and to get a good sense
[02:52:40.480 --> 02:52:41.900]   of what zone one happens to be in.
[02:52:41.900 --> 02:52:42.740]   - Yeah, great.
[02:52:42.740 --> 02:52:45.020]   So the first gear is your ability
[02:52:45.020 --> 02:52:48.060]   to simply breathe in and out through your nose
[02:52:48.060 --> 02:52:49.360]   at a set cadence.
[02:52:49.360 --> 02:52:52.220]   So basically, regardless of how hard you're working,
[02:52:52.220 --> 02:52:53.540]   can you restrict your breathing
[02:52:53.540 --> 02:52:56.400]   to like a two to three second inhale,
[02:52:56.400 --> 02:52:58.700]   and then a two to three second exhale?
[02:52:58.700 --> 02:53:00.640]   And this is really clever, actually,
[02:53:00.640 --> 02:53:04.380]   because a lot of folks will jump immediately
[02:53:04.380 --> 02:53:06.020]   into an over-breathing strategy,
[02:53:06.020 --> 02:53:08.060]   which means you'll be ventilating more than you need,
[02:53:08.060 --> 02:53:11.980]   which actually sends that RER up higher than it needs to be,
[02:53:11.980 --> 02:53:15.500]   which kicks you higher into carbohydrate utilization.
[02:53:15.500 --> 02:53:18.380]   If you're supposed to be in quote unquote zone one,
[02:53:18.380 --> 02:53:21.620]   you're trying to be efficient, not fast.
[02:53:21.620 --> 02:53:24.100]   So using more carbohydrates than you need
[02:53:24.100 --> 02:53:26.140]   is not beneficial here.
[02:53:26.140 --> 02:53:28.840]   You're walking for the day, you're out on a longer hike,
[02:53:28.840 --> 02:53:29.760]   you're enjoying the day,
[02:53:29.760 --> 02:53:32.620]   you shouldn't be trying to ramp up carbohydrate metabolism,
[02:53:32.620 --> 02:53:34.760]   it should be efficient.
[02:53:34.760 --> 02:53:37.580]   - Ah, and so this would be getting into an argument
[02:53:37.580 --> 02:53:39.520]   with somebody while on a long walk,
[02:53:39.520 --> 02:53:41.940]   you feel exhausted afterwards, even over-breathing.
[02:53:41.940 --> 02:53:43.500]   - Yeah, totally, right?
[02:53:43.500 --> 02:53:45.820]   So you should be able to breathe at a specific cadence,
[02:53:45.820 --> 02:53:48.720]   and generally people are doing that
[02:53:48.720 --> 02:53:50.700]   more frequently than they need.
[02:53:50.700 --> 02:53:54.440]   Zone two, rather gear two,
[02:53:54.440 --> 02:53:58.220]   is inhaling and exhaling at whatever rate you need it to be,
[02:53:58.220 --> 02:53:59.900]   but still nasal only.
[02:53:59.900 --> 02:54:03.620]   So it is a force, right?
[02:54:03.620 --> 02:54:05.200]   Whatever you need to do,
[02:54:05.200 --> 02:54:07.900]   but your mouth is closed the entire time.
[02:54:07.900 --> 02:54:09.200]   You shifted higher up,
[02:54:09.200 --> 02:54:12.240]   you're burning more and more carbohydrate as a fuel source,
[02:54:12.240 --> 02:54:14.300]   but you're still able to control that
[02:54:14.300 --> 02:54:16.080]   and restrict it through nasal breathing.
[02:54:16.080 --> 02:54:19.080]   Now, gear three and four, which is our final ones,
[02:54:19.080 --> 02:54:20.480]   there's no gear five,
[02:54:20.480 --> 02:54:22.920]   gear three and four is like a subtle distinction.
[02:54:22.920 --> 02:54:24.800]   I actually don't even care about the difference there.
[02:54:24.800 --> 02:54:27.540]   I basically use gear one, two, and then that's four,
[02:54:27.540 --> 02:54:28.600]   but you're basically talking about
[02:54:28.600 --> 02:54:31.520]   either a nose-to-mouth strategy
[02:54:31.520 --> 02:54:33.120]   or a straight up mouth-to-mouth, right?
[02:54:33.120 --> 02:54:35.460]   - So breathing in through the nose, out through the mouth.
[02:54:35.460 --> 02:54:36.480]   - If you can control it that way,
[02:54:36.480 --> 02:54:37.980]   you can do the opposite actually, right?
[02:54:37.980 --> 02:54:40.440]   Can you breathe in and out through your nose?
[02:54:40.440 --> 02:54:41.740]   But the classic one people will do
[02:54:41.740 --> 02:54:43.780]   is into the nose, out through the mouth.
[02:54:43.780 --> 02:54:45.280]   Again, I really don't even care about the distinction.
[02:54:45.280 --> 02:54:48.160]   I basically jump from two to four.
[02:54:48.160 --> 02:54:50.540]   Brian may do it differently, I don't actually know.
[02:54:50.540 --> 02:54:51.980]   Four is just mouth-to-mouth, right?
[02:54:51.980 --> 02:54:54.620]   And this is the case in most sporting applications.
[02:54:54.620 --> 02:54:56.400]   You're gonna be breathing
[02:54:56.400 --> 02:54:58.600]   because the nose is restricted, right?
[02:54:58.600 --> 02:54:59.680]   There's only so much space.
[02:54:59.680 --> 02:55:00.920]   And as we talked about earlier,
[02:55:00.920 --> 02:55:04.040]   the consequences of not having enough oxygen in
[02:55:04.040 --> 02:55:07.200]   or CO2 exhalation, if you're restricting that,
[02:55:07.200 --> 02:55:08.700]   this is gonna be problematic.
[02:55:08.700 --> 02:55:10.740]   So in your actual competition,
[02:55:10.740 --> 02:55:13.480]   please go to the mouth if you need to, right?
[02:55:13.480 --> 02:55:16.040]   We've practiced a lot trying to stay nasal only
[02:55:16.040 --> 02:55:17.580]   for as long as possible,
[02:55:17.580 --> 02:55:20.040]   but that's going to eventually happen.
[02:55:20.040 --> 02:55:21.600]   When you're doing your high intensity intervals
[02:55:21.600 --> 02:55:23.560]   and you're really going as hard as you can,
[02:55:23.560 --> 02:55:24.780]   you're gonna have to go to your mouth
[02:55:24.780 --> 02:55:26.920]   unless you're an absolute freakazoid
[02:55:26.920 --> 02:55:27.980]   and you can stay in your nose,
[02:55:27.980 --> 02:55:29.840]   but that's not gonna happen, right?
[02:55:29.840 --> 02:55:33.840]   Most people can't get past say 70 or 80%
[02:55:33.840 --> 02:55:35.440]   while breathing through your nose.
[02:55:35.440 --> 02:55:36.320]   I know some people can get higher,
[02:55:36.320 --> 02:55:37.620]   but that's the general distinction.
[02:55:37.620 --> 02:55:41.440]   So we pay much more attention to those particular gears
[02:55:41.440 --> 02:55:43.260]   than we do heart rate zones.
[02:55:43.260 --> 02:55:46.840]   - And zone five would be just pure mouth breathing all out,
[02:55:46.840 --> 02:55:48.040]   running for your life.
[02:55:48.040 --> 02:55:49.560]   - The gear system is just one to four.
[02:55:49.560 --> 02:55:50.560]   There's no fifth gear.
[02:55:50.560 --> 02:55:51.400]   - Got it.
[02:55:51.400 --> 02:55:53.480]   - So the gear four would again be mouth mouth,
[02:55:53.480 --> 02:55:54.600]   breathing as much in as you can,
[02:55:54.600 --> 02:55:55.760]   breathing as much as you can out.
[02:55:55.760 --> 02:55:56.600]   - Got it.
[02:55:56.600 --> 02:55:59.320]   And I appreciate your description of the gear system
[02:55:59.320 --> 02:56:01.960]   and how it roughly relates to the zones
[02:56:01.960 --> 02:56:03.240]   we've been talking about.
[02:56:03.240 --> 02:56:08.120]   I also am reminded if anyone wants to experience
[02:56:08.120 --> 02:56:09.680]   the relationship between breathing
[02:56:09.680 --> 02:56:11.400]   and the offloading of carbon dioxide
[02:56:11.400 --> 02:56:13.640]   and your ability to exert effort in anything,
[02:56:13.640 --> 02:56:16.240]   a game that a friend of mine sometimes likes to play
[02:56:16.240 --> 02:56:19.240]   when we walk or jog and talk is he'll say,
[02:56:19.240 --> 02:56:22.880]   let's just hold our breath now until we hit that piling
[02:56:22.880 --> 02:56:26.480]   or that lifeguard stand on the beach.
[02:56:26.480 --> 02:56:30.920]   And within seconds you actually can start to panic.
[02:56:30.920 --> 02:56:33.800]   It also becomes very hard to coordinate your action
[02:56:33.800 --> 02:56:34.640]   after a little while.
[02:56:34.640 --> 02:56:35.940]   Again, be really careful with this,
[02:56:35.940 --> 02:56:40.240]   but it will teach you in a moment in a very real world way
[02:56:40.240 --> 02:56:42.560]   how important it is to be able to offload carbon dioxide
[02:56:42.560 --> 02:56:45.000]   because you're probably not running out of oxygen
[02:56:45.000 --> 02:56:46.080]   at those lower intensities.
[02:56:46.080 --> 02:56:46.900]   - No question.
[02:56:46.900 --> 02:56:48.280]   - You're simply building up carbon dioxide
[02:56:48.280 --> 02:56:50.920]   and that gas reflex is screaming to go off
[02:56:50.920 --> 02:56:52.200]   and you're actively suppressing it.
[02:56:52.200 --> 02:56:55.920]   - Yeah, so the interesting test here is your CO2 tolerance.
[02:56:55.920 --> 02:56:58.500]   On Brian's website, you can go directly there.
[02:56:58.500 --> 02:57:00.600]   There's a video to how to run this test
[02:57:00.600 --> 02:57:01.960]   and then you can put in your numbers
[02:57:01.960 --> 02:57:04.520]   and it'll tell you sort of exactly what to do
[02:57:04.520 --> 02:57:05.620]   as a result of it.
[02:57:05.620 --> 02:57:07.440]   But the CO2 tolerance test is a test
[02:57:07.440 --> 02:57:09.220]   of exactly what you just mentioned.
[02:57:09.220 --> 02:57:11.760]   So you should be fairly tolerant.
[02:57:11.760 --> 02:57:13.820]   In other words, non-reactive.
[02:57:13.820 --> 02:57:16.900]   You can be responsive, but non-reactive
[02:57:16.900 --> 02:57:18.260]   to elevations in CO2.
[02:57:18.260 --> 02:57:20.000]   So you should see them and feel them,
[02:57:20.000 --> 02:57:21.920]   but you should be choosing how you respond
[02:57:21.920 --> 02:57:23.720]   rather than an inert reaction.
[02:57:23.720 --> 02:57:26.480]   There are interesting data looking at things
[02:57:26.480 --> 02:57:28.760]   like out of the blue panic attacks.
[02:57:28.760 --> 02:57:31.480]   You can actually notice those in blood
[02:57:31.480 --> 02:57:33.880]   via rises in CO2 up to 45 minutes
[02:57:33.880 --> 02:57:35.820]   prior to the event happening.
[02:57:35.820 --> 02:57:38.840]   So there are signals happening in your body
[02:57:38.840 --> 02:57:41.560]   that you may be sensitive or not sensitive to.
[02:57:41.560 --> 02:57:44.120]   The more in tune you can get with that,
[02:57:44.120 --> 02:57:45.860]   the better your life is gonna be.
[02:57:45.860 --> 02:57:47.320]   And even if we're specifically
[02:57:47.320 --> 02:57:49.240]   just talking about exercise performance.
[02:57:49.240 --> 02:57:51.880]   So it's okay for CO2 to rise.
[02:57:51.880 --> 02:57:52.880]   It's going to rise.
[02:57:52.880 --> 02:57:55.960]   It's a by-product of anaerobic anaerobic metabolism.
[02:57:55.960 --> 02:57:59.220]   It's a by-product of carbohydrate and fat metabolism
[02:57:59.220 --> 02:58:00.280]   as we've established.
[02:58:00.280 --> 02:58:01.520]   It's going to get there.
[02:58:01.520 --> 02:58:02.760]   You're going to feel that.
[02:58:02.760 --> 02:58:06.140]   However, if you immediately go into a panic
[02:58:06.140 --> 02:58:10.720]   because of a small increase in CO2, this is a problem.
[02:58:10.720 --> 02:58:13.040]   - So we're turning to anaerobic capacity.
[02:58:13.040 --> 02:58:15.400]   This morning we were training, not together.
[02:58:15.400 --> 02:58:17.880]   I couldn't keep up with your workout,
[02:58:17.880 --> 02:58:20.280]   but in the same general space.
[02:58:20.280 --> 02:58:23.840]   And I did my once a week, maximum heart rate,
[02:58:23.840 --> 02:58:25.760]   one minute sprint on the assault bike.
[02:58:25.760 --> 02:58:27.920]   Sometimes I'll do more minutes,
[02:58:27.920 --> 02:58:30.680]   meaning I will do one minute then take some rest
[02:58:30.680 --> 02:58:32.600]   and do another minute after some rest.
[02:58:32.600 --> 02:58:34.680]   But I decided to do that one minute with you there
[02:58:34.680 --> 02:58:35.960]   so I could learn from you.
[02:58:35.960 --> 02:58:40.340]   And indeed, I have to assume that that was largely
[02:58:40.340 --> 02:58:43.740]   within the anaerobic capacity realm.
[02:58:43.740 --> 02:58:47.120]   The first 30 seconds or so were manageable.
[02:58:47.120 --> 02:58:48.980]   We're getting more and more painful.
[02:58:48.980 --> 02:58:51.160]   There was a quit signal going off in my head.
[02:58:51.160 --> 02:58:54.180]   You said there's real magic that occurs around second 40
[02:58:54.180 --> 02:58:55.840]   and indeed somewhere around second 40
[02:58:55.840 --> 02:58:57.240]   for whatever reason, it seemed easier.
[02:58:57.240 --> 02:58:59.160]   But at the one minute mark, I was happy to stop
[02:58:59.160 --> 02:59:04.160]   because that was really at least what felt to me 100% output.
[02:59:04.160 --> 02:59:07.800]   Is that a good protocol for building up anaerobic capacity?
[02:59:07.800 --> 02:59:09.420]   Keeping in mind what you said before,
[02:59:09.420 --> 02:59:13.660]   which is that specificity or precision as you raised it
[02:59:13.660 --> 02:59:14.520]   is important.
[02:59:14.520 --> 02:59:18.280]   That is if I want to train anaerobic capacity for sprinting,
[02:59:18.280 --> 02:59:19.600]   I probably should have been sprinting.
[02:59:19.600 --> 02:59:23.800]   Cycling, I was on the assault bike and so on.
[02:59:24.700 --> 02:59:27.820]   How many of those one minute all out sprints
[02:59:27.820 --> 02:59:31.740]   or 30 second all out sprints on the bike
[02:59:31.740 --> 02:59:35.580]   could and should one perform per workout and per week?
[02:59:35.580 --> 02:59:37.940]   So marching through exercise choice.
[02:59:37.940 --> 02:59:39.080]   - Yep, let's do it.
[02:59:39.080 --> 02:59:41.980]   - Order, volume, frequency and progression.
[02:59:41.980 --> 02:59:42.820]   - Yep.
[02:59:42.820 --> 02:59:44.580]   - Choice of exercises,
[02:59:44.580 --> 02:59:47.780]   train for what you want to improve, is that right?
[02:59:47.780 --> 02:59:49.240]   - Not necessarily.
[02:59:49.240 --> 02:59:52.200]   So in this particular case, if you have a specific goal,
[02:59:52.200 --> 02:59:53.980]   yes, of course, do it.
[02:59:53.980 --> 02:59:57.060]   Exercise choice, a couple of things you want to look for.
[02:59:57.060 --> 03:00:00.580]   You want to pick something that you feel extremely confident
[03:00:00.580 --> 03:00:02.200]   in the movement with.
[03:00:02.200 --> 03:00:04.820]   Because you're going to forget your brain very quickly here
[03:00:04.820 --> 03:00:07.060]   because you're going to go into our pain cave.
[03:00:07.060 --> 03:00:11.980]   So if you're not comfortable running, don't go run here.
[03:00:11.980 --> 03:00:14.140]   You're never going to get to the spot we need to get to it.
[03:00:14.140 --> 03:00:17.220]   If you're not comfortable or if every time you go on a row
[03:00:17.220 --> 03:00:20.580]   or your low back hurts the next day, don't do it.
[03:00:20.580 --> 03:00:23.000]   If you're not comfortable using kettlebell swings,
[03:00:23.000 --> 03:00:23.840]   you get the point.
[03:00:23.840 --> 03:00:25.080]   Don't do an exercise you're not comfortable with.
[03:00:25.080 --> 03:00:27.840]   You also secondarily want to be careful and cautious
[03:00:27.840 --> 03:00:30.920]   of heavy eccentric loads.
[03:00:30.920 --> 03:00:32.540]   Because you're going to be doing a lot of repetitions
[03:00:32.540 --> 03:00:33.380]   at a high intensity.
[03:00:33.380 --> 03:00:35.280]   So this is where I love an assault bike.
[03:00:35.280 --> 03:00:36.640]   This is why a rower is great.
[03:00:36.640 --> 03:00:37.640]   Swimming is amazing.
[03:00:37.640 --> 03:00:40.620]   Running uphill, generally more favorable
[03:00:40.620 --> 03:00:43.680]   than running on normal ground,
[03:00:43.680 --> 03:00:44.860]   especially if you're not a runner.
[03:00:44.860 --> 03:00:46.140]   Don't run downhill.
[03:00:46.140 --> 03:00:47.560]   That's a lot of eccentric load.
[03:00:47.560 --> 03:00:50.000]   I don't love things like box jumps here.
[03:00:50.980 --> 03:00:53.300]   Because again, a lot of eccentric loading.
[03:00:53.300 --> 03:00:55.340]   Suppose you can jump up, land in the box, step down,
[03:00:55.340 --> 03:00:57.180]   but now you're, again, too many things
[03:00:57.180 --> 03:00:58.020]   are going through your mind.
[03:00:58.020 --> 03:00:58.940]   I don't want to slip and fall.
[03:00:58.940 --> 03:01:00.400]   I want to smash my shin in the box.
[03:01:00.400 --> 03:01:02.680]   What happens if I, too many variables.
[03:01:02.680 --> 03:01:06.080]   Pick something that is safer where you can really focus
[03:01:06.080 --> 03:01:09.300]   on your breathing and your posture and the performance.
[03:01:09.300 --> 03:01:11.400]   All right, so that's exercise choice.
[03:01:11.400 --> 03:01:13.060]   And then within that, if there's some specific thing
[03:01:13.060 --> 03:01:15.380]   you want to get better at, go ahead and do it.
[03:01:15.380 --> 03:01:16.680]   - Okay.
[03:01:16.680 --> 03:01:20.480]   - How many different movements, meaning should I do
[03:01:20.480 --> 03:01:24.680]   the assault bike and then some form of safe,
[03:01:24.680 --> 03:01:27.440]   executable overhead pressing?
[03:01:27.440 --> 03:01:29.220]   It's a little hard.
[03:01:29.220 --> 03:01:31.940]   It's a little harder to imagine anaerobic capacity
[03:01:31.940 --> 03:01:34.300]   for the upper body unless you have access to a skier
[03:01:34.300 --> 03:01:37.140]   or one of these, or what are those things called?
[03:01:37.140 --> 03:01:38.260]   The climber machines?
[03:01:38.260 --> 03:01:39.100]   - Yeah, the VersaClimber.
[03:01:39.100 --> 03:01:40.060]   - The VersaClimber.
[03:01:40.060 --> 03:01:41.660]   That's the one, the VersaClimber.
[03:01:41.660 --> 03:01:44.980]   You can tell how often I do that one.
[03:01:44.980 --> 03:01:46.180]   - It's a great exercise.
[03:01:46.180 --> 03:01:47.500]   - Great piece of exercise equipment.
[03:01:47.500 --> 03:01:52.020]   - Yeah, so we're thinking how many exercises
[03:01:52.020 --> 03:01:53.220]   and in what order?
[03:01:53.220 --> 03:01:54.940]   Is it going to be two or three exercises
[03:01:54.940 --> 03:01:57.460]   since you're involving a lot of muscle groups typically?
[03:01:57.460 --> 03:01:58.780]   - That's a really distinction.
[03:01:58.780 --> 03:02:01.420]   Generally, these are going to be total body movements.
[03:02:01.420 --> 03:02:03.060]   So you can do something like a SkiErg
[03:02:03.060 --> 03:02:05.220]   if you want to really isolate your upper body.
[03:02:05.220 --> 03:02:06.260]   Great, love that.
[03:02:06.260 --> 03:02:09.260]   You can do lower body isolation like cycling, right?
[03:02:09.260 --> 03:02:10.520]   Where your upper body's not involved.
[03:02:10.520 --> 03:02:12.380]   You can use weights here.
[03:02:12.380 --> 03:02:16.440]   You can do some barbell movements and stuff like that.
[03:02:16.440 --> 03:02:20.000]   They're just not my favorite choices for most people.
[03:02:20.000 --> 03:02:21.520]   Too many complexity things going on.
[03:02:21.520 --> 03:02:24.780]   So I generally am going to pick total body movements,
[03:02:24.780 --> 03:02:28.420]   pushing a sled, dragging a sled, sprinting uphill,
[03:02:28.420 --> 03:02:31.280]   swimming, these things like that are going to be good.
[03:02:31.280 --> 03:02:33.100]   - I'm seeing now why the assault bike
[03:02:33.100 --> 03:02:34.140]   is such a powerful tool,
[03:02:34.140 --> 03:02:35.580]   because you're using your arms
[03:02:35.580 --> 03:02:36.960]   with some degree of resistance,
[03:02:36.960 --> 03:02:39.700]   but not a lot of eccentric load, plus legs,
[03:02:39.700 --> 03:02:41.820]   some resistance, not a lot of eccentric load,
[03:02:41.820 --> 03:02:46.180]   and yet one can go "all out" for 30 to 60 seconds.
[03:02:46.180 --> 03:02:47.020]   - Yep.
[03:02:47.020 --> 03:02:50.900]   And the consequences of a technical breakdown are minimal.
[03:02:50.900 --> 03:02:52.180]   It's more like you're going to actually
[03:02:52.180 --> 03:02:54.540]   have a worse performance rather than an injury rate.
[03:02:54.540 --> 03:02:58.020]   So there's just a wonderful invention because of that.
[03:02:58.020 --> 03:03:00.380]   Where other things, the consequences,
[03:03:00.380 --> 03:03:01.940]   like say if you were going to be doing a barbell
[03:03:01.940 --> 03:03:03.340]   or kettlebell activity,
[03:03:03.340 --> 03:03:06.620]   the consequences of making a technical mistake,
[03:03:06.620 --> 03:03:08.880]   you might actually get an acute injury right there.
[03:03:08.880 --> 03:03:11.600]   So they're just a little bit higher in the risk scale.
[03:03:11.600 --> 03:03:14.780]   - How many sets, or sometimes referred to as repeats.
[03:03:14.780 --> 03:03:19.240]   So how many 30 to 60 second all out sprints,
[03:03:19.240 --> 03:03:21.140]   again, doesn't have to be running sprinting,
[03:03:21.140 --> 03:03:24.280]   but all out effort would be the better way to phrase it,
[03:03:24.280 --> 03:03:28.880]   should I perform, let's say per week,
[03:03:28.880 --> 03:03:31.220]   and then decide whether or not we can divide those up
[03:03:31.220 --> 03:03:32.240]   across multiple workouts,
[03:03:32.240 --> 03:03:34.880]   or whether or not it's better to do them in the same workout.
[03:03:34.880 --> 03:03:36.500]   - If you're staying with the same exercise
[03:03:36.500 --> 03:03:38.040]   for all of your workouts,
[03:03:38.040 --> 03:03:38.920]   that's a little bit different answer
[03:03:38.920 --> 03:03:40.620]   than if you're modifying them.
[03:03:40.620 --> 03:03:42.620]   So say you're going to do this three times a week,
[03:03:42.620 --> 03:03:44.900]   and you're going to do an air bike one day,
[03:03:44.900 --> 03:03:46.900]   you're going to do some hill sprints another day,
[03:03:46.900 --> 03:03:48.960]   and then you could do some swimming another day.
[03:03:48.960 --> 03:03:53.380]   - For sake of example, I'm going to say same movement,
[03:03:53.380 --> 03:03:55.760]   because I think most people are going to be most comfortable
[03:03:55.760 --> 03:03:58.500]   with one or two types of movements,
[03:03:58.500 --> 03:04:02.380]   unless they are really coordinated or an excellent athlete.
[03:04:02.380 --> 03:04:04.460]   I think most people can probably find a hill
[03:04:04.460 --> 03:04:08.800]   that they could run up and an air dine or a salt bike,
[03:04:08.800 --> 03:04:10.680]   a rower, things of that sort.
[03:04:10.680 --> 03:04:14.280]   - Yep, you're going to have a pro and a con here.
[03:04:14.280 --> 03:04:17.100]   So the pro of doing less sets
[03:04:17.100 --> 03:04:21.840]   is you can actually train much closer to truly 100%.
[03:04:21.840 --> 03:04:24.600]   The downside is volume's low, okay?
[03:04:24.600 --> 03:04:27.520]   So a major mistake people make here
[03:04:27.520 --> 03:04:29.040]   is they'll do something like,
[03:04:29.040 --> 03:04:32.240]   I'll do 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off,
[03:04:32.240 --> 03:04:34.660]   and I'll do that for 40 rounds.
[03:04:34.660 --> 03:04:36.120]   You're not really actually going that hard
[03:04:36.120 --> 03:04:36.960]   in those 20 seconds.
[03:04:36.960 --> 03:04:38.880]   So a key, in fact, if you look at the literature
[03:04:38.880 --> 03:04:42.020]   and all the positive benefits
[03:04:42.020 --> 03:04:43.720]   of high intensity interval training,
[03:04:43.720 --> 03:04:48.400]   that assumes you are actually hitting very close to 100%.
[03:04:48.400 --> 03:04:51.820]   If you're sliding down into, again, moderate training stuff,
[03:04:51.820 --> 03:04:53.200]   you start to actually be in a spot
[03:04:53.200 --> 03:04:57.880]   where you're not getting the total high end stuff,
[03:04:57.880 --> 03:04:59.080]   but you're not doing it long enough
[03:04:59.080 --> 03:05:00.320]   to get the low end stuff either.
[03:05:00.320 --> 03:05:03.500]   And so you end up in this, you burn some calories,
[03:05:03.500 --> 03:05:06.120]   you probably still enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis
[03:05:06.120 --> 03:05:07.480]   and a little bit of capitalization,
[03:05:07.480 --> 03:05:11.160]   but you didn't really justify only doing three rounds.
[03:05:11.160 --> 03:05:13.440]   That's where the problem comes in.
[03:05:13.440 --> 03:05:16.180]   So in terms of a couple of protocols I'll give you,
[03:05:16.180 --> 03:05:19.260]   how many sets per week, it's really hard to give a number,
[03:05:19.260 --> 03:05:20.780]   unlike the strengthening stuff,
[03:05:20.780 --> 03:05:23.760]   where it was easy to kind of land some stuff on.
[03:05:23.760 --> 03:05:25.680]   A typical thing you'll see is like a minimum bill
[03:05:25.680 --> 03:05:28.480]   tends to be something like four rounds per day,
[03:05:28.480 --> 03:05:29.920]   three times per week.
[03:05:29.920 --> 03:05:30.980]   - Wow, that's a lot.
[03:05:30.980 --> 03:05:35.740]   So my once a week all out effort
[03:05:35.740 --> 03:05:37.940]   of sprinting on the assault bike,
[03:05:37.940 --> 03:05:42.440]   the so-called Airdyne bike, for 60 seconds,
[03:05:42.440 --> 03:05:46.220]   one to three rounds of that,
[03:05:46.220 --> 03:05:47.980]   might be doing something useful for me,
[03:05:47.980 --> 03:05:50.500]   but I should probably be doing that
[03:05:50.500 --> 03:05:52.260]   two or three times a week.
[03:05:52.260 --> 03:05:53.700]   - If you're going to get to a max heart rate,
[03:05:53.700 --> 03:05:54.700]   I generally like to say,
[03:05:54.700 --> 03:05:58.420]   give me a minimum of one day a week, two is better.
[03:05:58.420 --> 03:06:00.620]   - Days per week, how many rounds?
[03:06:00.620 --> 03:06:03.020]   - Whatever it takes you to get to that maximum heart rate.
[03:06:03.020 --> 03:06:04.900]   Right, so in your case, you did one minute.
[03:06:04.900 --> 03:06:05.740]   - Okay, good.
[03:06:05.740 --> 03:06:08.460]   If you're going to extend past a minute or two,
[03:06:08.460 --> 03:06:10.900]   one round might be enough.
[03:06:10.900 --> 03:06:13.680]   So for example, if you want to just do something
[03:06:13.680 --> 03:06:17.100]   where I'm going to run a mile as fast as I can,
[03:06:17.100 --> 03:06:18.940]   that's all you need to do for the day.
[03:06:18.940 --> 03:06:20.100]   You don't need to do multiple,
[03:06:20.100 --> 03:06:21.660]   you can do mile repeats if you'd like,
[03:06:21.660 --> 03:06:22.940]   but that is really, really challenging.
[03:06:22.940 --> 03:06:25.160]   I know we've extended the time duration here,
[03:06:25.160 --> 03:06:27.940]   but I wanted to go there to show you
[03:06:27.940 --> 03:06:29.200]   the time domain matters here.
[03:06:29.200 --> 03:06:31.680]   If you're doing something like a 20 second burst,
[03:06:31.680 --> 03:06:33.460]   you're going to need more rounds.
[03:06:33.460 --> 03:06:35.500]   If you're doing something longer, like multiple minutes,
[03:06:35.500 --> 03:06:38.100]   you don't need as many rounds to get there.
[03:06:38.100 --> 03:06:43.100]   So in addition, if you're really reaching past
[03:06:43.100 --> 03:06:48.080]   this 90 seconds of hell window,
[03:06:48.080 --> 03:06:51.060]   it's just going to do a lot more damage to the system.
[03:06:51.060 --> 03:06:52.180]   Not damaged and then bad,
[03:06:52.180 --> 03:06:53.900]   but as in there's a lot to recover here.
[03:06:53.900 --> 03:06:56.780]   So we need more recovery time from that.
[03:06:56.780 --> 03:07:00.220]   A 20 second burst doesn't really challenge you.
[03:07:00.220 --> 03:07:01.700]   It challenges you in that 20 seconds,
[03:07:01.700 --> 03:07:03.460]   but you'll be recovered and fine.
[03:07:03.460 --> 03:07:05.980]   A three minute thing is going to hurt
[03:07:05.980 --> 03:07:07.900]   and it's going to hurt for many, many, many minutes
[03:07:07.900 --> 03:07:09.500]   after that and you're going to still see
[03:07:09.500 --> 03:07:12.100]   maybe some performance decrements the next day,
[03:07:12.100 --> 03:07:14.140]   depending on what your recovery stuff looks like.
[03:07:14.140 --> 03:07:16.940]   So a couple of things to play with
[03:07:16.940 --> 03:07:18.800]   would be something like this.
[03:07:18.800 --> 03:07:21.180]   If you want to try like a classic 30 seconds on,
[03:07:21.180 --> 03:07:22.900]   30 seconds off protocol,
[03:07:22.900 --> 03:07:25.240]   the literature will show like a minimum of four rounds
[03:07:25.240 --> 03:07:27.160]   of that probably three days a week.
[03:07:27.160 --> 03:07:30.820]   - So 30 seconds all out, 30 seconds rest is one round.
[03:07:30.820 --> 03:07:34.340]   Repeat that four times, at least once a week.
[03:07:34.340 --> 03:07:36.120]   - At least, two would be better.
[03:07:36.120 --> 03:07:36.960]   - Great.
[03:07:36.960 --> 03:07:37.780]   - Right?
[03:07:37.780 --> 03:07:39.380]   If you want to go something a lot longer than that,
[03:07:39.380 --> 03:07:41.760]   you might be able to get away with one.
[03:07:41.760 --> 03:07:44.660]   But generally two days a week of this is better.
[03:07:44.660 --> 03:07:46.360]   If you start actually pushing past
[03:07:46.360 --> 03:07:48.500]   like three to four days a week, up to five or six,
[03:07:48.500 --> 03:07:51.080]   you may actually be causing some problems.
[03:07:51.080 --> 03:07:54.920]   There's just a little bit of excess fatigue
[03:07:54.920 --> 03:07:55.760]   that's going to happen there
[03:07:55.760 --> 03:07:57.160]   that you maybe want to stay away from.
[03:07:57.160 --> 03:08:00.620]   In fact, you can see a lot of endocrinological problems
[03:08:00.620 --> 03:08:03.560]   and some other sleep issues and some other things kick in.
[03:08:03.560 --> 03:08:06.440]   And we'll talk about more of those things later.
[03:08:06.440 --> 03:08:08.280]   But that's the number to get with.
[03:08:08.280 --> 03:08:11.420]   If you want to try something more like a 20 second burst,
[03:08:11.420 --> 03:08:14.680]   I actually would recommend giving yourself more rest.
[03:08:14.680 --> 03:08:19.560]   So you can actually do a higher rest than work ratio.
[03:08:19.560 --> 03:08:21.880]   Most people tend to think of this as doing like one to one,
[03:08:21.880 --> 03:08:24.520]   20 seconds on, 20 seconds off or lower.
[03:08:24.520 --> 03:08:28.320]   I love doing like 20 seconds on, 40 seconds off.
[03:08:28.320 --> 03:08:31.520]   The quality of that 20 seconds becomes extraordinarily high.
[03:08:31.520 --> 03:08:35.140]   And it's also possible to now get like six to eight rounds.
[03:08:35.140 --> 03:08:39.420]   - So as I'm hearing this, I'm going to wager an offer.
[03:08:39.420 --> 03:08:44.420]   To you and if you say okay, then to those listening.
[03:08:44.420 --> 03:08:46.800]   Based on what you're telling me about the relationship
[03:08:46.800 --> 03:08:49.600]   between intensity and quality
[03:08:49.600 --> 03:08:53.940]   and the need for sufficient duration of this anaerobic work,
[03:08:55.440 --> 03:08:59.860]   how is five to six minutes per week of all out work?
[03:08:59.860 --> 03:09:00.700]   - That's pretty good.
[03:09:00.700 --> 03:09:03.660]   - So what that means for me is I would do
[03:09:03.660 --> 03:09:08.660]   three all out one minute sprints on one workout
[03:09:08.660 --> 03:09:13.560]   separated by a minute or two, maybe more.
[03:09:13.560 --> 03:09:18.240]   And I would do that two or three times per week,
[03:09:18.240 --> 03:09:20.120]   just trying to hit that five or six minute
[03:09:20.120 --> 03:09:21.240]   per week threshold.
[03:09:21.240 --> 03:09:25.480]   - Yep, actually I think one of the, Marty Gabala
[03:09:25.480 --> 03:09:30.120]   is a scientist, a Canadian guy, amazing work.
[03:09:30.120 --> 03:09:31.680]   He's done a lot of the research
[03:09:31.680 --> 03:09:33.160]   on high intensity anaerobic stuff, right?
[03:09:33.160 --> 03:09:37.220]   And I think the number he actually threw out there
[03:09:37.220 --> 03:09:39.120]   in some of his original research was comparing
[03:09:39.120 --> 03:09:43.260]   six total minutes of work to upwards of like 180 minutes
[03:09:43.260 --> 03:09:46.600]   of work throughout the entire week.
[03:09:46.600 --> 03:09:48.000]   And then one of the classic studies
[03:09:48.000 --> 03:09:49.560]   was looking at VO2 max improvements
[03:09:49.560 --> 03:09:51.320]   and he saw equal if not greater improvements
[03:09:51.320 --> 03:09:52.240]   of VO2 max with that.
[03:09:52.240 --> 03:09:54.160]   So I think actually the name of his book
[03:09:54.160 --> 03:09:56.360]   might be like this six minute workout or something.
[03:09:56.360 --> 03:09:59.680]   And so you'd like may have nailed that directly on the head.
[03:09:59.680 --> 03:10:01.440]   - Purely by luck, but actually by--
[03:10:01.440 --> 03:10:02.320]   - I also may be wrong on the numbers,
[03:10:02.320 --> 03:10:03.800]   we should probably fact check that.
[03:10:03.800 --> 03:10:06.280]   - Well, and also by inference from what you were saying,
[03:10:06.280 --> 03:10:08.680]   if you're gonna do this 20 seconds on 40 seconds off
[03:10:08.680 --> 03:10:11.600]   and you're doing more rounds or one minute all out.
[03:10:11.600 --> 03:10:13.680]   So the way I'm going to think about this,
[03:10:13.680 --> 03:10:18.680]   if it's okay with you is for five to six minutes a week,
[03:10:18.920 --> 03:10:22.000]   I am sprinting for my life.
[03:10:22.000 --> 03:10:22.840]   - Correct.
[03:10:22.840 --> 03:10:25.600]   - But I'm sprinting for my life with good form
[03:10:25.600 --> 03:10:27.720]   in whatever movement I happen to be doing.
[03:10:27.720 --> 03:10:29.940]   And I can do all of that in one workout,
[03:10:29.940 --> 03:10:34.660]   but I'm separating out bouts of 20 seconds
[03:10:34.660 --> 03:10:38.960]   all the way up to one minute by the necessary rest
[03:10:38.960 --> 03:10:40.880]   in order to recover my breathing,
[03:10:40.880 --> 03:10:42.320]   get back to pure nasal breathing,
[03:10:42.320 --> 03:10:45.400]   maybe zone one zone two, and then hit it again.
[03:10:45.400 --> 03:10:47.320]   - If you're gonna do the one minute thing like you do,
[03:10:47.320 --> 03:10:50.320]   I actually generally encourage one to three minutes of rest
[03:10:50.320 --> 03:10:51.520]   before you do the next round
[03:10:51.520 --> 03:10:53.320]   and probably up to four to six rounds,
[03:10:53.320 --> 03:10:54.960]   that would be your six minute number there.
[03:10:54.960 --> 03:10:57.200]   Now, the caveat there is we don't worry
[03:10:57.200 --> 03:10:58.480]   about heart rate recovery,
[03:10:58.480 --> 03:11:00.120]   we worry about exactly what you mentioned,
[03:11:00.120 --> 03:11:02.000]   which is nasal only recovery.
[03:11:02.000 --> 03:11:03.800]   Once you can get back to that,
[03:11:03.800 --> 03:11:06.120]   give yourself another 30 seconds or so,
[03:11:06.120 --> 03:11:08.360]   and then you're ready to go for round two.
[03:11:08.360 --> 03:11:09.180]   - This is where it gets fun
[03:11:09.180 --> 03:11:10.920]   because I can imagine challenging myself
[03:11:10.920 --> 03:11:14.620]   to get on the assault bike for one minute of kind of warm up,
[03:11:14.620 --> 03:11:17.080]   very low intensity each morning,
[03:11:17.080 --> 03:11:19.040]   and then sprint for a minute,
[03:11:19.040 --> 03:11:22.560]   and then head off into my daily routine.
[03:11:22.560 --> 03:11:23.760]   - No. - Okay.
[03:11:23.760 --> 03:11:26.420]   - That, if you're going to do that though,
[03:11:26.420 --> 03:11:29.000]   you need to give me three minutes of nasal only breathing
[03:11:29.000 --> 03:11:30.680]   before you go back to work.
[03:11:30.680 --> 03:11:32.100]   We need to downregulate after that.
[03:11:32.100 --> 03:11:33.120]   - And there are people in my life
[03:11:33.120 --> 03:11:35.320]   that would love for me to engage in more nasal breathing
[03:11:35.320 --> 03:11:38.120]   'cause it'll have me speaking less, so no problem.
[03:11:38.120 --> 03:11:42.200]   Chances are I'm going to use the two or three workouts
[03:11:42.200 --> 03:11:44.600]   per week of one minute all out.
[03:11:44.600 --> 03:11:46.080]   Maybe I'll try the shorter protocol.
[03:11:46.080 --> 03:11:48.080]   Can I give you one fun protocol to try here?
[03:11:48.080 --> 03:11:48.900]   - Please.
[03:11:48.900 --> 03:11:52.120]   - So if you have a, you can use this on any equipment,
[03:11:52.120 --> 03:11:55.320]   but I learned this from another mutual friend, Kenny Kane.
[03:11:55.320 --> 03:11:57.840]   This is a great little, it's a little test,
[03:11:57.840 --> 03:11:59.240]   a little game you can play with yourself,
[03:11:59.240 --> 03:12:02.980]   and the only way to play this game is you're going to lose,
[03:12:02.980 --> 03:12:04.300]   which is really, really lovely.
[03:12:04.300 --> 03:12:05.860]   So you can do this at any,
[03:12:05.860 --> 03:12:09.200]   you can do this for any duration of time,
[03:12:09.200 --> 03:12:10.920]   but two minutes is a good number.
[03:12:10.920 --> 03:12:13.360]   Okay, so you have to do this in somewhere
[03:12:13.360 --> 03:12:15.080]   where you can know distance.
[03:12:15.080 --> 03:12:18.020]   So this could be running, cycling,
[03:12:18.020 --> 03:12:20.680]   the air bike is what I use.
[03:12:20.680 --> 03:12:23.840]   The first two minutes, you're going to cover
[03:12:23.840 --> 03:12:27.560]   as much distance as you can possibly cover in two minutes,
[03:12:27.560 --> 03:12:30.000]   and you're going to note that.
[03:12:30.000 --> 03:12:34.400]   So let's say you covered 400 meters, right?
[03:12:34.400 --> 03:12:35.520]   Okay, great.
[03:12:35.520 --> 03:12:39.000]   You're going to rest for two minutes.
[03:12:39.000 --> 03:12:39.840]   Amazing.
[03:12:39.840 --> 03:12:42.020]   That next round, you're now going to go for distance.
[03:12:42.020 --> 03:12:44.040]   So you're going to cover the exact same amount of distance
[03:12:44.040 --> 03:12:45.080]   you covered in round one,
[03:12:45.080 --> 03:12:47.960]   which in this example was 400 meters,
[03:12:47.960 --> 03:12:50.160]   and it doesn't matter how long it takes you.
[03:12:50.160 --> 03:12:53.440]   It may take you two minutes and five seconds,
[03:12:53.440 --> 03:12:54.480]   two minutes and 10 seconds,
[03:12:54.480 --> 03:12:56.880]   'cause you're a little bit fatigued from round one.
[03:12:56.880 --> 03:12:58.460]   Round three, you're going to now come back
[03:12:58.460 --> 03:13:00.920]   and do that exact same time domain
[03:13:00.920 --> 03:13:01.820]   that you did in round two.
[03:13:01.820 --> 03:13:04.960]   So if it took you two minutes and five seconds in round two,
[03:13:04.960 --> 03:13:08.160]   now round three is going to last two minutes and five seconds
[03:13:08.160 --> 03:13:11.800]   and you want to see if you can cover a greater distance,
[03:13:11.800 --> 03:13:15.520]   405 meters, 410 meters than you did in round one.
[03:13:15.520 --> 03:13:17.600]   And the beauty of this little protocol,
[03:13:17.600 --> 03:13:20.680]   six minutes total of work, right?
[03:13:20.680 --> 03:13:23.360]   But if you slack in one of the rounds,
[03:13:23.360 --> 03:13:25.680]   you just make the next round harder.
[03:13:25.680 --> 03:13:27.080]   - Is there any rest between rounds?
[03:13:27.080 --> 03:13:28.860]   - Yeah, two minutes.
[03:13:28.860 --> 03:13:30.480]   - Always two minutes rest.
[03:13:30.480 --> 03:13:32.920]   - You don't have to, but this would be my recommendation.
[03:13:32.920 --> 03:13:34.200]   - Kenny Kane came up with this?
[03:13:34.200 --> 03:13:35.400]   - I don't know if he came up with it.
[03:13:35.400 --> 03:13:36.640]   He taught me this thing.
[03:13:36.640 --> 03:13:39.160]   - Well, we both know Kenny and he's an incredibly nice,
[03:13:39.160 --> 03:13:41.280]   an incredibly skilled trainer.
[03:13:41.280 --> 03:13:43.060]   I'm going to call it the sugar cane.
[03:13:43.060 --> 03:13:43.900]   - Yeah, it's so great because-
[03:13:43.900 --> 03:13:45.760]   - Because it sounds really painful.
[03:13:45.760 --> 03:13:48.280]   - And if you go out too hard in round one,
[03:13:48.280 --> 03:13:50.520]   you're in such big trouble round two.
[03:13:50.520 --> 03:13:52.160]   But if you go too easy in round one,
[03:13:52.160 --> 03:13:55.240]   you're going to get absolutely obliterated in round three.
[03:13:55.240 --> 03:13:57.060]   So it's like a wonderful thing.
[03:13:57.060 --> 03:13:59.560]   And you can pick that number as a standardization
[03:13:59.560 --> 03:14:01.920]   and then just try to improve that a little bit per week.
[03:14:01.920 --> 03:14:04.460]   So progression is the last part of this whole thing
[03:14:04.460 --> 03:14:06.800]   that we haven't gotten to yet before we move on.
[03:14:06.800 --> 03:14:10.120]   And the way you want to progress all of these things
[03:14:10.120 --> 03:14:13.120]   is you can timestamp, again, how much work you can do
[03:14:13.120 --> 03:14:15.640]   and then just try to do a slightly higher amount of work,
[03:14:15.640 --> 03:14:18.340]   5% or so, every week.
[03:14:18.340 --> 03:14:21.840]   Or you can add a round, which is a really nice way.
[03:14:21.840 --> 03:14:26.840]   So in the research studies that have been done,
[03:14:26.840 --> 03:14:28.780]   they're going to do things like week one,
[03:14:28.780 --> 03:14:30.000]   you'll do three rounds.
[03:14:30.000 --> 03:14:32.000]   Week two, you'll do four rounds.
[03:14:32.000 --> 03:14:33.060]   Three, you'll go five rounds.
[03:14:33.060 --> 03:14:35.640]   So you'll add a round until you get up to, say,
[03:14:35.640 --> 03:14:38.200]   six or seven or eight rounds at the end of the protocol.
[03:14:38.200 --> 03:14:40.160]   So that's a really nice way to go about it.
[03:14:40.160 --> 03:14:43.480]   Or you can cap the rounds and just try to get more work done
[03:14:43.480 --> 03:14:44.800]   in that same amount of time.
[03:14:44.800 --> 03:14:46.360]   - Meaning go more intensely.
[03:14:46.360 --> 03:14:47.560]   - Correct.
[03:14:47.560 --> 03:14:49.460]   Get further distance in your 30 seconds
[03:14:49.460 --> 03:14:51.780]   or your 45 seconds or whatever.
[03:14:51.780 --> 03:14:57.760]   I want to encourage people to go as low as 20 seconds.
[03:14:57.760 --> 03:15:00.080]   That's going to allow you to go very, very, very fast.
[03:15:00.080 --> 03:15:01.360]   That's going to actually challenge
[03:15:01.360 --> 03:15:04.040]   that phosphocreatine piece a little bit.
[03:15:04.040 --> 03:15:07.300]   I want to encourage people to also go as high as 90 seconds.
[03:15:07.300 --> 03:15:09.300]   So the honest way, the way that I will do it,
[03:15:09.300 --> 03:15:10.320]   not that it's about me,
[03:15:10.320 --> 03:15:13.320]   but just as an example of something you could do,
[03:15:13.320 --> 03:15:17.400]   I do something in the 15 to 20 second burst range.
[03:15:17.400 --> 03:15:19.280]   And I will generally hedge towards
[03:15:19.280 --> 03:15:22.220]   a two to one rest to work ratio.
[03:15:22.220 --> 03:15:25.460]   So I'm probably going to rest 40 to 60 seconds.
[03:15:25.460 --> 03:15:28.140]   That's to make sure that 20 second burst
[03:15:28.140 --> 03:15:30.720]   is extremely high quality.
[03:15:30.720 --> 03:15:31.560]   Cool.
[03:15:31.560 --> 03:15:32.520]   I'm also going to do something
[03:15:32.520 --> 03:15:36.080]   in the 30 to 50 second range.
[03:15:36.080 --> 03:15:38.920]   I might go one to one work rest ratio.
[03:15:38.920 --> 03:15:41.960]   The quality of those 30 seconds is going to come down,
[03:15:41.960 --> 03:15:43.460]   but the acid buffering
[03:15:43.460 --> 03:15:46.320]   is going to be extraordinarily challenged.
[03:15:46.320 --> 03:15:50.900]   I also will do that with a triple or quadruple rest range.
[03:15:50.900 --> 03:15:54.600]   So again, 30 seconds on, maybe two minutes off.
[03:15:54.600 --> 03:15:56.480]   Now, I won't be able to be,
[03:15:56.480 --> 03:15:58.840]   I won't be working on my ability to handle
[03:15:58.840 --> 03:16:01.540]   the waste product buildup there,
[03:16:01.540 --> 03:16:02.940]   but I'll be working on my ability
[03:16:02.940 --> 03:16:05.240]   to produce more force over that time,
[03:16:05.240 --> 03:16:06.600]   which is another skill set.
[03:16:06.600 --> 03:16:08.120]   And then all the way up to say what you do,
[03:16:08.120 --> 03:16:09.840]   a minute, 70 seconds,
[03:16:09.840 --> 03:16:13.280]   and you can go one to one there or up to three to one.
[03:16:13.280 --> 03:16:14.120]   You're going to be working on
[03:16:14.120 --> 03:16:14.940]   a little bit of this different thing,
[03:16:14.940 --> 03:16:18.140]   but that's exactly how we hit both sides of this equation,
[03:16:18.140 --> 03:16:19.480]   working on dealing with waste,
[03:16:19.480 --> 03:16:22.180]   as well as actually working on bringing in nutrients
[03:16:22.180 --> 03:16:24.080]   and getting that system a little bit more effective.
[03:16:24.080 --> 03:16:27.040]   So you could set that up across your week
[03:16:27.040 --> 03:16:29.480]   and just, it could be something like
[03:16:29.480 --> 03:16:32.160]   day one is that 20 second burst window,
[03:16:32.160 --> 03:16:35.380]   day two is that maybe 60 second window,
[03:16:35.380 --> 03:16:38.980]   and then day three is maybe one all out effort.
[03:16:38.980 --> 03:16:40.960]   And we're done there.
[03:16:40.960 --> 03:16:44.240]   - Let's talk about the specific protocols and adaptations
[03:16:44.240 --> 03:16:47.340]   related to maximum aerobic output
[03:16:47.340 --> 03:16:51.040]   or maximum aerobic capacity, as it's sometimes called.
[03:16:51.040 --> 03:16:51.880]   - Sure.
[03:16:51.880 --> 03:16:54.480]   Now we're moving past like that couple of minute range
[03:16:54.480 --> 03:16:57.840]   into like the five to 15 minute range,
[03:16:57.840 --> 03:17:00.180]   but at a maximum intensity.
[03:17:00.180 --> 03:17:02.080]   So it's the highest you can go from there.
[03:17:02.080 --> 03:17:04.180]   We're not talking about our last category
[03:17:04.180 --> 03:17:05.560]   of long duration here.
[03:17:05.560 --> 03:17:06.900]   Well, the beautiful part is,
[03:17:06.900 --> 03:17:08.880]   we've already explained a lot of it
[03:17:08.880 --> 03:17:10.920]   'cause it's very similar to what we just talked about
[03:17:10.920 --> 03:17:12.880]   with anaerobic capacity.
[03:17:12.880 --> 03:17:15.840]   It is primarily going to be a problem
[03:17:15.840 --> 03:17:18.180]   of dealing with waste products, especially at the end.
[03:17:18.180 --> 03:17:20.120]   It's not enough total distance
[03:17:20.120 --> 03:17:22.320]   to be running out of muscle glycogen,
[03:17:22.320 --> 03:17:24.760]   though it may start to creep down a little bit.
[03:17:24.760 --> 03:17:26.400]   Fat's not going to be an issue,
[03:17:26.400 --> 03:17:28.700]   but certainly more oxygen transportation
[03:17:28.700 --> 03:17:29.540]   is going to be an issue.
[03:17:29.540 --> 03:17:32.220]   So we're just hedging a little bit more towards
[03:17:32.220 --> 03:17:33.900]   that side of the equation,
[03:17:33.900 --> 03:17:36.860]   towards the end of that workout.
[03:17:36.860 --> 03:17:37.840]   No doubt about it,
[03:17:37.840 --> 03:17:40.900]   clearing out waste products is going to be a huge issue,
[03:17:40.900 --> 03:17:43.580]   but really oxygen demand and delivery
[03:17:43.580 --> 03:17:45.740]   is starting to take more of a prominent role
[03:17:45.740 --> 03:17:49.120]   because we have had more time to clear the waste.
[03:17:49.120 --> 03:17:50.380]   And if we're not good at that,
[03:17:50.380 --> 03:17:54.660]   we're going to be failing earlier than we need.
[03:17:54.660 --> 03:17:56.380]   So the training for that
[03:17:56.380 --> 03:17:59.380]   needs to be a little bit at that exact same.
[03:17:59.380 --> 03:18:02.980]   So a classic thing here is a one mile test.
[03:18:02.980 --> 03:18:04.400]   This is going to last for most people
[03:18:04.400 --> 03:18:06.660]   somewhere between five and 10 minutes.
[03:18:06.660 --> 03:18:08.780]   You're sort of right in this window.
[03:18:08.780 --> 03:18:10.660]   If you just want to practice that once a week,
[03:18:10.660 --> 03:18:12.200]   we're done here.
[03:18:12.200 --> 03:18:15.380]   Exercise choice, same thing we talked about.
[03:18:15.380 --> 03:18:17.060]   Pick an exercise you're comfortable with
[03:18:17.060 --> 03:18:18.740]   that you can actually do,
[03:18:18.740 --> 03:18:21.180]   and you can progressively increase
[03:18:21.180 --> 03:18:22.860]   in terms of the intensity.
[03:18:22.860 --> 03:18:25.940]   You're not going to have to stop and change your exercise.
[03:18:25.940 --> 03:18:26.780]   You're not going to move around.
[03:18:26.780 --> 03:18:28.560]   It's like a circuit isn't great here
[03:18:28.560 --> 03:18:30.640]   because you got to put one implement down,
[03:18:30.640 --> 03:18:31.600]   pick up another one.
[03:18:31.600 --> 03:18:32.600]   You want to be doing something
[03:18:32.600 --> 03:18:35.560]   where there is literally not a second of off switch.
[03:18:35.560 --> 03:18:38.540]   So similar exercise choice principles we just covered.
[03:18:38.540 --> 03:18:41.380]   If you're going to become a real savage
[03:18:41.380 --> 03:18:43.460]   and you want to do repeats here, you can.
[03:18:43.460 --> 03:18:45.940]   Endurance folks will do that a lot.
[03:18:45.940 --> 03:18:49.300]   One mile repeats, 800 meter repeats, things like that,
[03:18:49.300 --> 03:18:51.820]   or I'm not sure what the swimming distance equivalents
[03:18:51.820 --> 03:18:54.040]   would be, but swimmers, we do this constantly,
[03:18:54.040 --> 03:18:55.600]   but you don't need to.
[03:18:55.600 --> 03:18:56.620]   This is really hard.
[03:18:56.620 --> 03:18:57.780]   It's pretty hard in the system.
[03:18:57.780 --> 03:18:58.800]   It's very good for you.
[03:18:58.800 --> 03:19:00.960]   One to twice a week of hitting this,
[03:19:00.960 --> 03:19:03.440]   I think you'd be in a really, really good spot.
[03:19:03.440 --> 03:19:04.920]   Frequency we sort of just covered.
[03:19:04.920 --> 03:19:06.700]   We covered exercise choice.
[03:19:06.700 --> 03:19:08.100]   Volume we just sort of nailed,
[03:19:08.100 --> 03:19:12.560]   and intensity is basically running you up to the top there.
[03:19:12.560 --> 03:19:15.140]   Now, because you can only do that so often,
[03:19:15.140 --> 03:19:19.420]   you want to add in another 40 or so percent of your time
[03:19:19.420 --> 03:19:22.440]   being lower intensity support work for that.
[03:19:22.440 --> 03:19:24.860]   So this is something probably less than 85%
[03:19:24.860 --> 03:19:28.500]   of your heart rate, but higher than quote unquote zone two.
[03:19:28.500 --> 03:19:29.540]   You got to be working here.
[03:19:29.540 --> 03:19:31.420]   This is not, I could have a conversation pace.
[03:19:31.420 --> 03:19:32.500]   This is higher than that.
[03:19:32.500 --> 03:19:35.280]   It's in between conversation pace
[03:19:35.280 --> 03:19:36.620]   and the pace I need to be at
[03:19:36.620 --> 03:19:38.580]   to run my fastest mile I've ever done.
[03:19:38.580 --> 03:19:39.500]   That's that middle ground.
[03:19:39.500 --> 03:19:42.020]   And you need to train that so that you can continue
[03:19:42.020 --> 03:19:45.460]   to work on capitalization, oxygen transportation,
[03:19:45.460 --> 03:19:47.220]   but you're not burning down the house,
[03:19:47.220 --> 03:19:50.960]   getting all the way up to 100 plus percent of your VO2 max.
[03:19:51.860 --> 03:19:56.860]   Could I use a crude version of this where I say,
[03:19:56.860 --> 03:20:00.580]   okay, I'm going to exercise for 10 minutes.
[03:20:00.580 --> 03:20:03.640]   I'm going to go as fast as I safely can.
[03:20:03.640 --> 03:20:08.640]   And every week I'm going to measure how far I travel.
[03:20:08.640 --> 03:20:11.060]   - Yep, easy. - In that 10 minutes.
[03:20:11.060 --> 03:20:11.900]   - Love it.
[03:20:11.900 --> 03:20:14.300]   - Probably not on the same day
[03:20:14.300 --> 03:20:16.620]   that I'm doing the anaerobic capacity work.
[03:20:16.620 --> 03:20:18.180]   - Probably not.
[03:20:18.180 --> 03:20:23.180]   - Probably okay to do after a strength training
[03:20:23.180 --> 03:20:27.060]   or hypertrophy workout, as long as I didn't train legs.
[03:20:27.060 --> 03:20:32.060]   - You could, it's probably going to compromise recovery
[03:20:32.060 --> 03:20:34.040]   is the way.
[03:20:34.040 --> 03:20:35.420]   So I would, if you're going to do a session like this,
[03:20:35.420 --> 03:20:37.380]   I would probably do it on its own day.
[03:20:37.380 --> 03:20:40.540]   Unless you wanted to do something like speed or power,
[03:20:40.540 --> 03:20:43.300]   then you could roll right into this and have no problem.
[03:20:43.300 --> 03:20:46.660]   Maybe a strength day, a hypertrophy day.
[03:20:46.660 --> 03:20:50.060]   I'm not sure you would do there because again,
[03:20:50.060 --> 03:20:52.900]   especially if you did any sort of lower body exercise,
[03:20:52.900 --> 03:20:53.860]   you're going to be compromised here.
[03:20:53.860 --> 03:20:57.760]   But remember these tend to be full body movements.
[03:20:57.760 --> 03:20:58.940]   So even if you did arms that day,
[03:20:58.940 --> 03:21:00.420]   your arms are going to be compromised
[03:21:00.420 --> 03:21:01.520]   and you don't want to fail this
[03:21:01.520 --> 03:21:03.300]   because of local muscular failure.
[03:21:03.300 --> 03:21:05.780]   - All right, so now I've got my work cut out for me.
[03:21:05.780 --> 03:21:08.860]   I'm going to be doing five to six minutes per week
[03:21:08.860 --> 03:21:13.460]   of all out work divided into 20 to 60 second bouts
[03:21:13.460 --> 03:21:16.020]   with sufficient rest.
[03:21:16.020 --> 03:21:20.000]   And I'm going to give myself 10 minutes a week of,
[03:21:20.000 --> 03:21:23.100]   in my case, it'll probably be running as fast as I can
[03:21:23.100 --> 03:21:26.280]   'cause I do enjoy running and I can do it safely,
[03:21:26.280 --> 03:21:28.320]   maybe uphill and see how far I go.
[03:21:28.320 --> 03:21:31.020]   - Yep, if you want to combine the two.
[03:21:31.020 --> 03:21:33.180]   So if you're just saying, hey, I'm bought in, Andy,
[03:21:33.180 --> 03:21:34.780]   like I want to do both of these things.
[03:21:34.780 --> 03:21:37.660]   They are similar, but they have independent benefits.
[03:21:37.660 --> 03:21:38.500]   I'm convinced.
[03:21:38.500 --> 03:21:40.480]   How would I build these into the same week?
[03:21:40.480 --> 03:21:44.140]   Maybe do one of each.
[03:21:44.140 --> 03:21:46.260]   That still gets you at quote unquote two days per week
[03:21:46.260 --> 03:21:47.640]   where you're going to hit a high maximum heart rate.
[03:21:47.640 --> 03:21:49.100]   So we already checked that box off.
[03:21:49.100 --> 03:21:52.180]   So one day can be a shorter length interval repeat one.
[03:21:52.180 --> 03:21:56.420]   And the other one can simply be a five to 15 minute
[03:21:56.420 --> 03:21:58.940]   maximum work and you're done.
[03:21:58.940 --> 03:22:02.140]   - Long duration endurance exercise,
[03:22:02.140 --> 03:22:04.980]   the stereotypical endurance exercise.
[03:22:04.980 --> 03:22:06.520]   - Sure.
[03:22:06.520 --> 03:22:11.520]   - How far, how long, how fast or how slow, rather,
[03:22:11.520 --> 03:22:12.880]   should I go?
[03:22:12.880 --> 03:22:17.880]   And here I'm going to venture that exercise choice
[03:22:17.880 --> 03:22:21.840]   is one that we could click off even at this point
[03:22:21.840 --> 03:22:23.860]   in the discussion, because obviously it's got to be
[03:22:23.860 --> 03:22:26.020]   something that I can do for a long while
[03:22:26.020 --> 03:22:31.020]   without getting injured, overuse injuries.
[03:22:31.020 --> 03:22:32.140]   - There's a little bit of novelty
[03:22:32.140 --> 03:22:33.700]   we can actually throw in here.
[03:22:33.700 --> 03:22:38.380]   So one of the things I love to do for long duration
[03:22:38.380 --> 03:22:40.600]   and endurance for people who don't love running,
[03:22:40.600 --> 03:22:43.780]   cycling or swimming is you can do the really cool workout.
[03:22:43.780 --> 03:22:45.700]   Any number of things where you can put a little circuit
[03:22:45.700 --> 03:22:48.480]   together, as long as there's not a lot of downtime
[03:22:48.480 --> 03:22:50.780]   between one circuit to the next time.
[03:22:50.780 --> 03:22:53.120]   You can actually do something as simple as like,
[03:22:53.120 --> 03:22:56.100]   maybe you're going to do farmer's carries
[03:22:56.100 --> 03:22:59.100]   and you'll do that for say three minutes
[03:22:59.100 --> 03:23:01.020]   and you'll set those down and you'll go straight
[03:23:01.020 --> 03:23:03.300]   into a plank for a minute and you'll pick that up
[03:23:03.300 --> 03:23:06.260]   and you go straight into maybe body weight squats
[03:23:06.260 --> 03:23:07.100]   for two minutes.
[03:23:07.100 --> 03:23:08.540]   Then you go straight into another exercise
[03:23:08.540 --> 03:23:11.000]   and you can sort of rotate things around.
[03:23:11.000 --> 03:23:14.400]   Maybe you can do even some like shadowboxing stuff
[03:23:14.400 --> 03:23:15.980]   or some jump rope.
[03:23:15.980 --> 03:23:17.880]   You can do different gymnastics movements
[03:23:17.880 --> 03:23:20.680]   and body weight movements and you can run that thing through
[03:23:20.680 --> 03:23:23.320]   and you can basically get the exact same thing accomplished
[03:23:23.320 --> 03:23:26.240]   and not feel like you're doing, oh my gosh,
[03:23:26.240 --> 03:23:28.160]   this mind numbing type of training,
[03:23:28.160 --> 03:23:29.680]   if it feels like that to you.
[03:23:29.680 --> 03:23:32.080]   Another way you can do that to actually even simplify it
[03:23:32.080 --> 03:23:34.920]   even more, we've done this at Kenny Kane's gym
[03:23:34.920 --> 03:23:36.680]   plenty of times where you just maybe even pick
[03:23:36.680 --> 03:23:37.500]   three machines.
[03:23:37.500 --> 03:23:39.840]   So you're going to, I'm going to go 10 minutes on the rower
[03:23:39.840 --> 03:23:41.400]   and I'm going to go 10 minutes on the treadmill
[03:23:41.400 --> 03:23:43.040]   and I'm going to go 10 minutes on the bike.
[03:23:43.040 --> 03:23:45.400]   You can actually knock a 30 minute, quote unquote,
[03:23:45.400 --> 03:23:48.680]   steady state session out in and not feel those problems
[03:23:48.680 --> 03:23:49.520]   if those things happen.
[03:23:49.520 --> 03:23:50.720]   So you can actually have a lot of fun there.
[03:23:50.720 --> 03:23:55.200]   We will do a lot of times with our fighters,
[03:23:55.200 --> 03:23:58.480]   we'll do things like put a very low load,
[03:23:58.480 --> 03:24:02.560]   I'm talking sub 50% of your max on a barbell
[03:24:02.560 --> 03:24:04.480]   and you're going to squat and you're going to do,
[03:24:04.480 --> 03:24:06.440]   you know, maybe a minute.
[03:24:06.440 --> 03:24:08.360]   You're going to put that down and then you're going to go over
[03:24:08.360 --> 03:24:09.760]   and do 50% of a bench press.
[03:24:09.760 --> 03:24:11.360]   You're going to put that down, you're going to go over
[03:24:11.360 --> 03:24:14.960]   and do 50% of a crab walk.
[03:24:14.960 --> 03:24:16.680]   And then you're going to go over and do another one
[03:24:16.680 --> 03:24:19.120]   and you can actually run through this entire thing.
[03:24:19.120 --> 03:24:21.880]   You don't hit that many reps in any individual movement.
[03:24:21.880 --> 03:24:23.700]   The load is very, very light.
[03:24:23.700 --> 03:24:26.380]   And you can keep heart rate basically at a steady state
[03:24:26.380 --> 03:24:29.640]   and do 15 or 20 or 30 different exercises.
[03:24:29.640 --> 03:24:32.600]   And it's actually like fairly fun and engaging to do.
[03:24:32.600 --> 03:24:35.600]   And it's a little bit more specific than trying to get
[03:24:35.600 --> 03:24:39.880]   a 275 pound NFL player to run for 30 minutes,
[03:24:39.880 --> 03:24:41.640]   which is not going to be good.
[03:24:41.640 --> 03:24:44.600]   - I'm just chuckling because I love to run outdoors
[03:24:44.600 --> 03:24:48.720]   and I've enjoyed runs on all my travels
[03:24:48.720 --> 03:24:51.880]   and I find it to be a great way to see different places.
[03:24:51.880 --> 03:24:53.360]   And I like moving through space,
[03:24:53.360 --> 03:24:55.640]   but there are weather conditions
[03:24:55.640 --> 03:24:57.400]   and times when that's not an option.
[03:24:57.400 --> 03:24:59.480]   So what you described as a terrific alternative.
[03:24:59.480 --> 03:25:03.440]   I have to assume that the specific adaptation
[03:25:03.440 --> 03:25:07.380]   that's occurring here is related to the fat burning system.
[03:25:07.380 --> 03:25:10.920]   And again, that doesn't necessarily mean fat loss overall,
[03:25:10.920 --> 03:25:12.600]   but fat burning system.
[03:25:12.600 --> 03:25:13.640]   And yet I do have a question,
[03:25:13.640 --> 03:25:18.540]   which is can you build enhanced microcapillary systems
[03:25:18.540 --> 03:25:21.800]   into the muscles by doing this long duration cardio?
[03:25:21.800 --> 03:25:23.080]   - Yeah, absolutely can.
[03:25:23.080 --> 03:25:26.600]   In fact, depending on which paper you like more
[03:25:26.600 --> 03:25:29.680]   than the other papers, you may even find evidence
[03:25:29.680 --> 03:25:33.400]   that this is a superior method than anything else.
[03:25:33.400 --> 03:25:36.680]   So steady state endurance is very important.
[03:25:36.680 --> 03:25:40.880]   I used to not like it as much.
[03:25:40.880 --> 03:25:42.800]   There's just so much evidence now that suggests
[03:25:42.800 --> 03:25:46.240]   it's probably a really good thing for basically everybody.
[03:25:46.240 --> 03:25:49.960]   Maybe for some individuals it's not in all year
[03:25:49.960 --> 03:25:53.360]   of their training, but if you're not a high level athlete
[03:25:53.360 --> 03:25:55.920]   or have a very specific goal that's right in front of you,
[03:25:55.920 --> 03:25:59.440]   it's probably best to do at least 20 minutes as a minimum,
[03:25:59.440 --> 03:26:04.200]   maybe 30 minutes of some steady state exercise once a week
[03:26:04.200 --> 03:26:07.920]   for basically any training goal outside of, again,
[03:26:07.920 --> 03:26:11.500]   a couple of really specific scenarios that are happening.
[03:26:11.500 --> 03:26:14.420]   The other thing that kind of kicks in here
[03:26:14.420 --> 03:26:15.680]   that we haven't really talked about
[03:26:15.680 --> 03:26:18.700]   is now we're actually reaching a position
[03:26:18.700 --> 03:26:22.600]   where fatigue of the intercostal starts to play.
[03:26:22.600 --> 03:26:25.120]   So diaphragmatic fatigue starts to run on an occasion.
[03:26:25.120 --> 03:26:29.840]   So we forget generally breathing is a contraction
[03:26:29.840 --> 03:26:31.940]   to open up the lungs to change pressure
[03:26:31.940 --> 03:26:33.400]   so the air will flow in.
[03:26:33.400 --> 03:26:35.640]   And then the exhalation is passive, right?
[03:26:35.640 --> 03:26:37.120]   It's just a muscle has been stretched,
[03:26:37.120 --> 03:26:38.480]   it goes back to its resting.
[03:26:38.480 --> 03:26:40.080]   When you get to a maximum heart rate,
[03:26:40.080 --> 03:26:42.520]   inhalation and exhalation become active.
[03:26:42.520 --> 03:26:44.080]   So you're squeezing as hard as you can to open up
[03:26:44.080 --> 03:26:47.080]   and you're squeezing to contract to blow air out.
[03:26:47.080 --> 03:26:49.600]   You're going to get fatigued, that system, right?
[03:26:49.600 --> 03:26:53.160]   Over time, you have contracted, contracted to open up.
[03:26:53.160 --> 03:26:55.000]   If that system starts to get fatigued,
[03:26:55.000 --> 03:26:56.520]   you start running into failure here.
[03:26:56.520 --> 03:26:58.120]   So you need to practice that.
[03:26:58.120 --> 03:27:00.520]   And this is when all kinds of things like breathing drills
[03:27:00.520 --> 03:27:03.160]   to just simply training in this fashion.
[03:27:03.160 --> 03:27:06.300]   There's all kinds of exercise devices for your lungs.
[03:27:06.300 --> 03:27:07.140]   And when we say that,
[03:27:07.140 --> 03:27:08.240]   that's what we're really talking about.
[03:27:08.240 --> 03:27:12.100]   The musculature around the lungs needs to not fatigue.
[03:27:12.100 --> 03:27:13.600]   So that's the only other little component
[03:27:13.600 --> 03:27:15.000]   I wanted to throw in here.
[03:27:15.000 --> 03:27:17.680]   If we're not talking about acid buffering,
[03:27:17.680 --> 03:27:20.460]   which in this particular case is not a problem anymore,
[03:27:20.460 --> 03:27:23.760]   the time domain is long and slow earth.
[03:27:23.760 --> 03:27:26.060]   So we have plenty of time to use fat as a fuel.
[03:27:26.060 --> 03:27:28.360]   We also have plenty of time to use anaerobic,
[03:27:28.360 --> 03:27:31.640]   anaerobic glycolysis and clear out waste products.
[03:27:31.640 --> 03:27:34.720]   So we don't really see pH being a problem
[03:27:34.720 --> 03:27:36.220]   with this type of exercise.
[03:27:36.220 --> 03:27:38.520]   You may start running low on liver glycogen
[03:27:38.520 --> 03:27:40.400]   if you're going a very long time.
[03:27:40.400 --> 03:27:42.500]   Muscle glycogen may start getting low,
[03:27:42.500 --> 03:27:45.160]   but not really, these are huge issues.
[03:27:45.160 --> 03:27:46.600]   You're going to run into maybe a little bit
[03:27:46.600 --> 03:27:47.560]   of a stroke volume issue,
[03:27:47.560 --> 03:27:51.040]   but an intensity is not high enough to become a problem.
[03:27:51.040 --> 03:27:53.560]   You're more likely to break down posturally
[03:27:53.560 --> 03:27:55.600]   or breathing mechanics than really anything else.
[03:27:55.600 --> 03:27:58.160]   Unless again, that duration really gets generally
[03:27:58.160 --> 03:28:00.500]   past two hours for most people.
[03:28:00.500 --> 03:28:03.000]   So those are the things that are going to limit us.
[03:28:03.000 --> 03:28:04.520]   So how do we improve it?
[03:28:04.520 --> 03:28:05.360]   What do we train?
[03:28:05.360 --> 03:28:06.860]   We went through the exercise choices.
[03:28:06.860 --> 03:28:09.040]   You also need to make sure you're training
[03:28:09.040 --> 03:28:09.880]   your intercostals.
[03:28:09.880 --> 03:28:13.160]   We need to be training our diaphragm in some fashion.
[03:28:13.160 --> 03:28:15.040]   Again, it can be the exercise itself,
[03:28:15.040 --> 03:28:16.440]   can be your normal training.
[03:28:16.440 --> 03:28:19.200]   The thing you need to be careful of here,
[03:28:19.200 --> 03:28:20.940]   and this is actually true for all the things
[03:28:20.940 --> 03:28:22.600]   we just talked about.
[03:28:22.600 --> 03:28:24.240]   When we think about fatigue
[03:28:24.240 --> 03:28:26.680]   and we think about failure and endurance,
[03:28:26.680 --> 03:28:29.520]   we really need to pay attention to technical breakdown.
[03:28:29.520 --> 03:28:32.600]   That is always the marker we look for.
[03:28:32.600 --> 03:28:34.960]   So when we go through our stuff with our athletes
[03:28:34.960 --> 03:28:37.840]   and they quote unquote fail or they finish,
[03:28:37.840 --> 03:28:39.080]   that's generally because we saw
[03:28:39.080 --> 03:28:41.040]   a massive technical breakdown.
[03:28:41.040 --> 03:28:42.080]   You're done.
[03:28:42.080 --> 03:28:43.440]   Like you're over there.
[03:28:43.440 --> 03:28:45.600]   Not always the case during all your round of training,
[03:28:45.600 --> 03:28:47.340]   but this is something to really pay attention to.
[03:28:47.340 --> 03:28:49.640]   So if you're on that bike and you're 40 seconds in
[03:28:49.640 --> 03:28:52.200]   and all of a sudden posture starts to crunching over,
[03:28:52.200 --> 03:28:53.440]   I may stop the test.
[03:28:53.440 --> 03:28:54.600]   I may stop the training.
[03:28:54.600 --> 03:28:56.840]   It's like, no, what we decided failure was
[03:28:56.840 --> 03:29:01.760]   is when you lost your technique to some sufficient level.
[03:29:01.760 --> 03:29:02.980]   So you want to pay attention to that too,
[03:29:02.980 --> 03:29:04.600]   because that's going to determine your ability
[03:29:04.600 --> 03:29:08.160]   to perform well as well as maintain efficiency,
[03:29:08.160 --> 03:29:10.640]   which is a really big problem here.
[03:29:10.640 --> 03:29:12.800]   - Tell me if the protocol I'm about to describe
[03:29:12.800 --> 03:29:15.520]   would be a reasonable one for people to incorporate
[03:29:18.080 --> 03:29:23.080]   60 to 120 minutes of long duration work per week.
[03:29:23.080 --> 03:29:30.520]   So one way to accomplish that that I often use
[03:29:30.520 --> 03:29:34.600]   is to head out for a weight vested hike.
[03:29:34.600 --> 03:29:36.300]   It's not a heavyweight vest.
[03:29:36.300 --> 03:29:38.600]   It's maybe, I think it's eight or 10 pounds.
[03:29:38.600 --> 03:29:39.500]   It's one of these thinner ones.
[03:29:39.500 --> 03:29:41.340]   And if people don't have access to that,
[03:29:41.340 --> 03:29:44.540]   you can bring a backpack with some items in it.
[03:29:44.540 --> 03:29:45.380]   I mean, it can be as simple as that.
[03:29:45.380 --> 03:29:46.600]   - You don't even need external load.
[03:29:46.600 --> 03:29:47.640]   It can just be your body.
[03:29:47.640 --> 03:29:48.480]   - Okay, great.
[03:29:48.480 --> 03:29:52.120]   And do some hiking at a fast enough clip
[03:29:52.120 --> 03:29:54.360]   that I'm breathing harder than I would be
[03:29:54.360 --> 03:29:56.320]   if I just kind of shuffled along.
[03:29:56.320 --> 03:29:59.400]   I might stop here or there, drink some water, no big deal,
[03:29:59.400 --> 03:30:01.760]   but I can carry on a conversation if I need to.
[03:30:01.760 --> 03:30:03.720]   So it's zone two-ish,
[03:30:03.720 --> 03:30:06.240]   but probably pushing a little bit harder than that
[03:30:06.240 --> 03:30:07.900]   for that duration.
[03:30:07.900 --> 03:30:11.680]   Not a lot of deep soreness occurring after this,
[03:30:11.680 --> 03:30:12.960]   maybe a little bit of achiness
[03:30:12.960 --> 03:30:15.080]   and some stabilization muscles that were used
[03:30:15.080 --> 03:30:16.400]   that may not be used too much,
[03:30:16.400 --> 03:30:19.160]   especially if I've been sitting a lot during the week.
[03:30:19.160 --> 03:30:21.680]   Kind of reminds me of how much I've been sitting.
[03:30:21.680 --> 03:30:25.600]   But doing that all in one long afternoon,
[03:30:25.600 --> 03:30:26.600]   typically on a weekend,
[03:30:26.600 --> 03:30:30.120]   or doing two shorter sessions throughout the week,
[03:30:30.120 --> 03:30:32.040]   maybe 45 minutes and 45 minutes,
[03:30:32.040 --> 03:30:35.720]   and then working up the progression to longer duration.
[03:30:35.720 --> 03:30:37.040]   Seems like that would be something
[03:30:37.040 --> 03:30:40.320]   that most people should be able to do
[03:30:40.320 --> 03:30:42.800]   and that it would weave in well
[03:30:42.800 --> 03:30:45.420]   with any resistance training
[03:30:45.420 --> 03:30:50.240]   or the anaerobic and aerobic output capacity work
[03:30:50.240 --> 03:30:51.840]   that we talked about just a moment ago.
[03:30:51.840 --> 03:30:54.020]   - Great, that's a fine version to do it.
[03:30:54.020 --> 03:30:55.680]   If you want to go shorter
[03:30:55.680 --> 03:30:57.480]   and bring up the intensity a little bit,
[03:30:57.480 --> 03:31:00.980]   so you want to keep it more to the 30 to 60 minute range
[03:31:00.980 --> 03:31:02.920]   and go closer into the,
[03:31:02.920 --> 03:31:04.880]   I can't have a conversation right now,
[03:31:04.880 --> 03:31:07.920]   but again, I'm not at a blistering heart rate,
[03:31:07.920 --> 03:31:09.360]   then you could probably get that same thing done
[03:31:09.360 --> 03:31:12.320]   in a smaller time window if that was a consideration.
[03:31:12.320 --> 03:31:15.900]   So if you wanted to blend all three of these together,
[03:31:15.900 --> 03:31:17.780]   you have a lot of wiggle room, right?
[03:31:17.780 --> 03:31:21.280]   So you could do something like order.
[03:31:21.280 --> 03:31:23.700]   If we're talking about this type of training,
[03:31:23.700 --> 03:31:25.620]   you could do this first
[03:31:25.620 --> 03:31:27.500]   and then finish with either one
[03:31:27.500 --> 03:31:29.620]   of the higher intensity stuff we talked about.
[03:31:29.620 --> 03:31:31.380]   So it could be roped into the same thing.
[03:31:31.380 --> 03:31:33.420]   It could be its own independent day.
[03:31:33.420 --> 03:31:35.220]   Could be your sort of active recovery day.
[03:31:35.220 --> 03:31:37.020]   It tends to be fairly restorative,
[03:31:37.020 --> 03:31:39.300]   as you alluded to a little bit there.
[03:31:39.300 --> 03:31:40.260]   So it's not that big a deal
[03:31:40.260 --> 03:31:41.620]   to do this on your quote unquote off day.
[03:31:41.620 --> 03:31:45.340]   If you're that type of person who like even on your off day,
[03:31:45.340 --> 03:31:49.280]   you have to do something physical, this is fine, right?
[03:31:49.280 --> 03:31:51.780]   If you wanted to do it on a lifting day,
[03:31:51.780 --> 03:31:54.560]   especially if it's a power strength day, it's probably fine.
[03:31:54.560 --> 03:31:56.920]   If you wanted to do it before the workout or after it,
[03:31:56.920 --> 03:31:58.780]   either way, you're probably okay.
[03:31:58.780 --> 03:32:01.520]   Probably best to do it after,
[03:32:01.520 --> 03:32:02.500]   if the primary goal
[03:32:02.500 --> 03:32:04.020]   is one of the strength training adaptations.
[03:32:04.020 --> 03:32:07.660]   If it's not, if this is a primary goal, do it first.
[03:32:07.660 --> 03:32:08.720]   Amazing.
[03:32:08.720 --> 03:32:11.420]   If you wanted to do it in the combination
[03:32:11.420 --> 03:32:14.360]   with the other interval stuff, you could do it fine there.
[03:32:14.360 --> 03:32:16.860]   You could do it before or you could do it afterwards.
[03:32:16.860 --> 03:32:18.780]   I actually have no problem doing it afterwards
[03:32:18.780 --> 03:32:21.040]   because that in effect,
[03:32:21.040 --> 03:32:24.620]   especially if you say nasal only during this training,
[03:32:24.620 --> 03:32:26.520]   will help the downregulation go.
[03:32:26.520 --> 03:32:27.520]   And so you could finish
[03:32:27.520 --> 03:32:30.020]   that fairly well downregulated actually.
[03:32:30.020 --> 03:32:33.160]   So it's kind of like a nice way to get thoroughly warmed up,
[03:32:33.160 --> 03:32:35.560]   go really, really hard,
[03:32:35.560 --> 03:32:39.600]   and then give it a nice 20 to 30 minute slow back down.
[03:32:39.600 --> 03:32:40.560]   And by the time you finish,
[03:32:40.560 --> 03:32:43.800]   maybe even on a three minute walk.
[03:32:43.800 --> 03:32:49.240]   - Nice, slow nasal breathing.
[03:32:49.240 --> 03:32:51.020]   - Four second inhale.
[03:32:51.020 --> 03:32:54.140]   Four second inhale, maybe five.
[03:32:54.140 --> 03:32:56.080]   So you can play with the numbers a little bit.
[03:32:56.080 --> 03:32:57.040]   Then maybe you don't even need
[03:32:57.040 --> 03:32:58.600]   to do the downregulation breathing afterwards.
[03:32:58.600 --> 03:32:59.600]   You'll be in a good spot.
[03:32:59.600 --> 03:33:02.000]   Well, you wouldn't want to do this before.
[03:33:02.000 --> 03:33:04.760]   Do your intervals, finish your intervals, throw up,
[03:33:04.760 --> 03:33:07.080]   lay on the ground, sweat all over the gym floor,
[03:33:07.080 --> 03:33:08.140]   get up and go back to work.
[03:33:08.140 --> 03:33:10.700]   That's probably not our best strategy.
[03:33:10.700 --> 03:33:12.940]   - As people are hearing this all,
[03:33:12.940 --> 03:33:15.080]   they may be thinking, wow, this is a lot of work to do,
[03:33:15.080 --> 03:33:17.400]   but I've been keeping track of the math here.
[03:33:17.400 --> 03:33:19.520]   So I'm sure some of you out there are as well.
[03:33:19.520 --> 03:33:24.200]   And we're really talking about 10 minutes of running
[03:33:24.200 --> 03:33:27.720]   or sprinting on the bike or rower once a week.
[03:33:27.720 --> 03:33:29.400]   We're talking about six minutes or so
[03:33:29.400 --> 03:33:31.680]   of the much higher intensity,
[03:33:31.680 --> 03:33:35.120]   but short bouts divided into rounds of 20 seconds
[03:33:35.120 --> 03:33:36.960]   to a minute with rest in between.
[03:33:36.960 --> 03:33:40.680]   And then some longer duration workout of 30 minutes minimum,
[03:33:40.680 --> 03:33:42.920]   but maybe as much as an hour, even two hours,
[03:33:42.920 --> 03:33:46.900]   which in total doesn't really equate to that much time,
[03:33:46.900 --> 03:33:48.840]   especially if one can access these things
[03:33:48.840 --> 03:33:51.040]   right out their front door or at home.
[03:33:51.040 --> 03:33:52.060]   And as we pointed out,
[03:33:52.060 --> 03:33:55.100]   you don't need any specialized equipment to do that.
[03:33:55.100 --> 03:33:58.680]   Oh, and I forgot the muscular endurance.
[03:33:59.920 --> 03:34:01.760]   I wasn't trying to cheat there.
[03:34:01.760 --> 03:34:05.020]   There's some muscular endurance thrown in as well.
[03:34:05.020 --> 03:34:07.480]   So that brings me to a question,
[03:34:07.480 --> 03:34:09.960]   which is if I'm doing my training
[03:34:09.960 --> 03:34:11.800]   for muscular endurance each week,
[03:34:11.800 --> 03:34:16.200]   for anaerobic capacity and for maximum aerobic output
[03:34:16.200 --> 03:34:19.960]   and long duration, and given that all of that,
[03:34:19.960 --> 03:34:22.680]   it's gonna take roughly two hours for the typical person,
[03:34:22.680 --> 03:34:24.120]   total for the entire week,
[03:34:24.120 --> 03:34:27.140]   which I would argue is going to give you back
[03:34:27.140 --> 03:34:29.480]   so much life literally in terms of longevity,
[03:34:29.480 --> 03:34:31.480]   you're literally gonna earn back years of your life.
[03:34:31.480 --> 03:34:33.040]   - Productivity, you name it.
[03:34:33.040 --> 03:34:35.880]   - Offsetting all sorts of metabolic issues
[03:34:35.880 --> 03:34:39.720]   and enhancing your sleep and improving mood.
[03:34:39.720 --> 03:34:41.720]   I mean, there's so much data,
[03:34:41.720 --> 03:34:45.040]   so much data pointing to all those positive benefits.
[03:34:45.040 --> 03:34:46.560]   If I do all of these things
[03:34:46.560 --> 03:34:49.640]   and I'm fairly consistent about them,
[03:34:49.640 --> 03:34:52.560]   am I going to be metabolically flexible?
[03:34:52.560 --> 03:34:57.560]   Am I going to have a well-developed fat burning,
[03:34:57.600 --> 03:34:59.840]   carbohydrate burning system?
[03:34:59.840 --> 03:35:03.520]   And will I be essentially fit?
[03:35:03.520 --> 03:35:04.400]   I mean, this is not,
[03:35:04.400 --> 03:35:06.480]   leaving aside issues of strength and hypertrophy,
[03:35:06.480 --> 03:35:09.400]   which were covered in the previous episode,
[03:35:09.400 --> 03:35:10.280]   will I be fit?
[03:35:10.280 --> 03:35:15.040]   I mean, to my mind, the ability to sprint very fast
[03:35:15.040 --> 03:35:17.320]   if one needs to, the ability to go longer duration
[03:35:17.320 --> 03:35:19.800]   if one needs to, and the ability to do something in between
[03:35:19.800 --> 03:35:23.240]   as well as hold a box overhead if necessary
[03:35:23.240 --> 03:35:25.280]   while installing a shelf or something like that,
[03:35:25.280 --> 03:35:27.560]   these are the realities of life.
[03:35:27.560 --> 03:35:30.480]   And to me represent real functional world fitness.
[03:35:30.480 --> 03:35:31.840]   If that's the case,
[03:35:31.840 --> 03:35:33.880]   is there anything that we would want to add to this program
[03:35:33.880 --> 03:35:35.960]   or would you consider that a fairly comprehensive
[03:35:35.960 --> 03:35:38.560]   and complete endurance training system?
[03:35:38.560 --> 03:35:43.560]   - If we remember the target, which is, I want to have energy,
[03:35:43.560 --> 03:35:46.040]   I want to look a certain way,
[03:35:46.040 --> 03:35:47.480]   and you want to be able to do that
[03:35:47.480 --> 03:35:50.280]   for the duration of your life, for a very long life.
[03:35:50.280 --> 03:35:52.560]   This style of training,
[03:35:52.560 --> 03:35:55.680]   where you incorporate all of those areas of endurance
[03:35:55.680 --> 03:35:58.160]   gives you all of the necessary adaptations
[03:35:58.160 --> 03:36:01.200]   one would need to execute all of those things.
[03:36:01.200 --> 03:36:05.800]   Remember, fat loss or weight management
[03:36:05.800 --> 03:36:10.280]   is not best done with any individual style of protocol.
[03:36:10.280 --> 03:36:11.920]   So if you do a little bit of all three of these,
[03:36:11.920 --> 03:36:13.440]   you've checked that fat loss box.
[03:36:13.440 --> 03:36:16.200]   You don't need to go out and do anything separate for it.
[03:36:16.200 --> 03:36:19.800]   You've done all the things then to cover aesthetics
[03:36:19.800 --> 03:36:21.840]   from that side of the equation, right?
[03:36:21.840 --> 03:36:25.880]   You've done the things to both enhance mitochondria,
[03:36:25.880 --> 03:36:29.360]   to enhance blood flow, increase oxygenation
[03:36:29.360 --> 03:36:33.040]   and manage fatigue and waste development.
[03:36:33.040 --> 03:36:35.800]   Boom, energy's there, fatigue is there.
[03:36:35.800 --> 03:36:37.880]   I'm not going to get tired or have to quit
[03:36:37.880 --> 03:36:40.880]   or stop or sit down doing any of these activities I want.
[03:36:40.880 --> 03:36:42.360]   At the same time,
[03:36:42.360 --> 03:36:44.920]   if you look at the literature on mortality,
[03:36:44.920 --> 03:36:46.760]   one of the strongest predictors
[03:36:46.760 --> 03:36:50.320]   of how long you're going to live is your VO2 max.
[03:36:50.320 --> 03:36:53.280]   So we've set up a scenario in which you're going to hit
[03:36:53.280 --> 03:36:55.080]   all three of those primary goals
[03:36:55.080 --> 03:36:57.680]   by doing a combination of this training.
[03:36:57.680 --> 03:37:00.560]   You're not going to miss any plausible adaptation
[03:37:00.560 --> 03:37:02.800]   from endurance training and you should be set
[03:37:02.800 --> 03:37:04.640]   for regardless of your goal.
[03:37:04.640 --> 03:37:06.600]   - Incredible.
[03:37:06.600 --> 03:37:10.040]   And as I understand, totally compatible
[03:37:10.040 --> 03:37:12.240]   with strength and hypertrophy training
[03:37:12.240 --> 03:37:15.860]   provided that your goal is to also be strong
[03:37:15.860 --> 03:37:18.280]   and also selectively hypertrophy
[03:37:18.280 --> 03:37:20.200]   or generally hypertrophy your muscles
[03:37:20.200 --> 03:37:21.680]   or maintain your muscles.
[03:37:21.680 --> 03:37:25.120]   For many people that are listening to this,
[03:37:25.120 --> 03:37:27.400]   I'm guessing that they have an interest
[03:37:27.400 --> 03:37:29.320]   in building more endurance,
[03:37:29.320 --> 03:37:31.440]   but not just the ability to go further,
[03:37:31.440 --> 03:37:35.200]   but the ability to go a given distance at a higher speed
[03:37:35.200 --> 03:37:38.160]   and to do it with better form and to breathe better
[03:37:38.160 --> 03:37:40.660]   and to feel better before, during and after.
[03:37:40.660 --> 03:37:45.120]   For those folks, maybe you could spell out a program
[03:37:45.120 --> 03:37:48.360]   that combines these different elements of endurance
[03:37:48.360 --> 03:37:51.800]   and does so in a way that informs how, for instance,
[03:37:51.800 --> 03:37:55.240]   the higher intensity short duration sprints
[03:37:55.240 --> 03:37:59.360]   would be expected to improve their longer duration work
[03:37:59.360 --> 03:38:03.480]   and how perhaps their longer duration work can progress
[03:38:03.480 --> 03:38:06.080]   if they are careful to include some planks
[03:38:06.080 --> 03:38:08.300]   and some wall sets and things of that sort.
[03:38:08.300 --> 03:38:10.960]   I asked this question specifically
[03:38:10.960 --> 03:38:13.920]   because I have to believe that while there probably
[03:38:13.920 --> 03:38:15.200]   are some folks out there that are looking
[03:38:15.200 --> 03:38:18.720]   to just maximize their plank from week to week to week,
[03:38:18.720 --> 03:38:21.220]   typically it seems that people fall into these categories
[03:38:21.220 --> 03:38:24.320]   of either wanting to get stronger and get bigger muscles
[03:38:24.320 --> 03:38:27.520]   to varying degrees or to get better at endurance
[03:38:27.520 --> 03:38:29.640]   or to get better at everything overall.
[03:38:29.640 --> 03:38:31.120]   Right now, I'd really like to just focus
[03:38:31.120 --> 03:38:34.800]   on what you think is a nice contour of a program
[03:38:34.800 --> 03:38:37.680]   for the person that wants to get better at endurance,
[03:38:37.680 --> 03:38:40.640]   but do it with more speed, more stability,
[03:38:40.640 --> 03:38:43.420]   and just feel like a strong endurance runner,
[03:38:43.420 --> 03:38:46.160]   cycler, swimmer, or whatever happens
[03:38:46.160 --> 03:38:47.520]   to be their endurance event.
[03:38:47.520 --> 03:38:48.420]   - Okay, great.
[03:38:48.420 --> 03:38:50.200]   So let's just give an example.
[03:38:50.200 --> 03:38:52.900]   Maybe you want to run your first half marathon,
[03:38:52.900 --> 03:38:54.480]   something like that, okay?
[03:38:54.480 --> 03:38:55.520]   Maybe done a couple of times before,
[03:38:55.520 --> 03:38:57.840]   but you just want to get better at that time.
[03:38:57.840 --> 03:38:59.800]   I would probably put somewhere in the neighborhood
[03:38:59.800 --> 03:39:03.760]   of 60 to 70% of your mileage
[03:39:03.760 --> 03:39:06.260]   in the moderate intensity zone, okay?
[03:39:06.260 --> 03:39:08.280]   So you need to accumulate mileage
[03:39:08.280 --> 03:39:09.480]   and you need to be able to handle
[03:39:09.480 --> 03:39:10.800]   what we call the tissue tolerance.
[03:39:10.800 --> 03:39:13.740]   So in this case, your feet need to be able to handle
[03:39:13.740 --> 03:39:15.780]   13 miles of pounding, okay?
[03:39:15.780 --> 03:39:18.380]   It doesn't matter how much high heart rate training you do
[03:39:18.380 --> 03:39:21.740]   or your fat deliverability, none of that matters
[03:39:21.740 --> 03:39:24.840]   if your feet are blown up by mile eight, okay?
[03:39:24.840 --> 03:39:28.620]   So in addition, we talked about how even training
[03:39:28.620 --> 03:39:31.980]   in that 70 to 85% heart rate zone
[03:39:31.980 --> 03:39:34.960]   is quite effective at oxygen delivery,
[03:39:34.960 --> 03:39:37.380]   fat utilization, capitalization, et cetera.
[03:39:37.380 --> 03:39:39.880]   So you're going to get a lot of direct endurance benefits
[03:39:39.880 --> 03:39:40.840]   from that work.
[03:39:40.840 --> 03:39:42.160]   You're also going to be working on
[03:39:42.160 --> 03:39:44.840]   what's honestly going to be one of your limiting factors,
[03:39:44.840 --> 03:39:48.120]   which is that tissue tolerance and that pounding, okay?
[03:39:48.120 --> 03:39:50.960]   In addition, you need to be efficient with your technique
[03:39:50.960 --> 03:39:52.440]   and you need a lot of repetitions
[03:39:52.440 --> 03:39:54.520]   for motor skill development.
[03:39:54.520 --> 03:39:56.360]   So you want to spend most of your time there.
[03:39:56.360 --> 03:39:57.800]   It's easy to recover from,
[03:39:57.800 --> 03:40:02.240]   it's not extremely demanding and challenging, awesome.
[03:40:02.240 --> 03:40:05.000]   That leaves you with another 30 or 40% of training.
[03:40:05.000 --> 03:40:10.000]   I would spend 10% of that in that like 20 second burst area.
[03:40:10.000 --> 03:40:13.200]   You're going to drive up fatigue extremely high
[03:40:13.200 --> 03:40:15.160]   and you're going to really maximize your ability
[03:40:15.160 --> 03:40:18.360]   to recover from waste production.
[03:40:18.360 --> 03:40:19.440]   All right, great.
[03:40:19.440 --> 03:40:21.380]   I would spend the remaining amount of time
[03:40:21.380 --> 03:40:25.060]   either on a little bit of actually maximum speed stuff
[03:40:25.060 --> 03:40:26.640]   that could actually be in a 20 second burst
[03:40:26.640 --> 03:40:29.280]   if you're really trying to go as fast as you can
[03:40:29.280 --> 03:40:31.560]   at the beginning of that exercise.
[03:40:31.560 --> 03:40:33.720]   And then the rest of it I would spend in that other zone,
[03:40:33.720 --> 03:40:37.560]   which is more of like the five to 15 minutes,
[03:40:37.560 --> 03:40:39.280]   but you're probably going to want to repeat those.
[03:40:39.280 --> 03:40:43.100]   And this is when things like 800 meter run,
[03:40:43.100 --> 03:40:45.600]   rest for double the time,
[03:40:45.600 --> 03:40:47.420]   and then repeat that two or three times.
[03:40:47.420 --> 03:40:49.580]   You actually need that in this scenario
[03:40:49.580 --> 03:40:51.500]   because you're going to need to be able to be running
[03:40:51.500 --> 03:40:53.840]   for two, most people are going to do a half marathon
[03:40:53.840 --> 03:40:56.880]   and maybe around two hours or so, something like that.
[03:40:56.880 --> 03:40:58.040]   And so you want a little bit
[03:40:58.040 --> 03:41:00.880]   of what we call repeated endurance, right?
[03:41:00.880 --> 03:41:03.880]   So be able to handle that higher heart rate, come back down,
[03:41:03.880 --> 03:41:04.720]   do it again.
[03:41:04.720 --> 03:41:05.680]   At the same time,
[03:41:05.680 --> 03:41:08.280]   that's actually how you bump your mileage up.
[03:41:08.280 --> 03:41:09.980]   So instead of having this do more
[03:41:09.980 --> 03:41:12.480]   of these long duration distance runs,
[03:41:12.480 --> 03:41:15.720]   you can still get maybe five or six miles done in a day
[03:41:15.720 --> 03:41:18.340]   if you're going to do a one mile repeat
[03:41:18.340 --> 03:41:19.600]   or whatever number you're looking at.
[03:41:19.600 --> 03:41:21.360]   So for a lot of people,
[03:41:21.360 --> 03:41:23.560]   that's kind of how I would structure it.
[03:41:23.560 --> 03:41:26.160]   That's honestly is very similar to what we laid out
[03:41:26.160 --> 03:41:27.400]   in the previous conversation,
[03:41:27.400 --> 03:41:30.960]   which is getting this idea that more than 50%
[03:41:30.960 --> 03:41:33.280]   should be basically practice.
[03:41:33.280 --> 03:41:36.100]   A little bit of work at the very top end of the spectrum,
[03:41:36.100 --> 03:41:36.940]   but not too much.
[03:41:36.940 --> 03:41:38.800]   And then a little bit of work at the other end,
[03:41:38.800 --> 03:41:40.320]   and you should be in a good spot.
[03:41:40.320 --> 03:41:43.040]   A major mistake one would make here is only doing
[03:41:43.040 --> 03:41:44.560]   the long duration steady state stuff
[03:41:44.560 --> 03:41:45.820]   and just sort of saying,
[03:41:45.820 --> 03:41:47.760]   I'm going to run a five mile this week
[03:41:47.760 --> 03:41:50.080]   and then do six miles next week and seven a set.
[03:41:50.080 --> 03:41:52.200]   That might work for you.
[03:41:52.200 --> 03:41:53.800]   I think we have enough evidence at this point,
[03:41:53.800 --> 03:41:55.280]   both in the scientific realm,
[03:41:55.280 --> 03:41:57.040]   as well as most of the coaches.
[03:41:57.040 --> 03:41:58.360]   I think in this space would agree with me
[03:41:58.360 --> 03:42:00.640]   is that's a suboptimal strategy.
[03:42:00.640 --> 03:42:03.000]   So it could work, but we can do better.
[03:42:03.000 --> 03:42:05.900]   - And in terms of the structure of a program like this,
[03:42:05.900 --> 03:42:08.800]   I realize that those structures vary tremendously.
[03:42:08.800 --> 03:42:11.000]   Different coaches and different books and different programs
[03:42:11.000 --> 03:42:13.100]   are going to say, oh, you should run Monday through Friday
[03:42:13.100 --> 03:42:15.080]   with weekends off or every other day.
[03:42:15.080 --> 03:42:19.560]   But in terms of this 70%, 30% divide
[03:42:19.560 --> 03:42:22.840]   where 70% is going toward the specific event,
[03:42:22.840 --> 03:42:24.900]   doing the kind of work that you're going to do
[03:42:24.900 --> 03:42:27.420]   during the specific event that you're most interested
[03:42:27.420 --> 03:42:30.420]   in cultivating or improving and the remaining 30%
[03:42:30.420 --> 03:42:33.560]   coming from other sorts of supporting work.
[03:42:33.560 --> 03:42:37.960]   How should one think about distributing that other 30%?
[03:42:37.960 --> 03:42:40.680]   Should it be all geared towards maximizing recovery
[03:42:40.680 --> 03:42:42.540]   for the 70%?
[03:42:42.540 --> 03:42:47.540]   Or in other words, could I do all that 30% work on one day?
[03:42:47.540 --> 03:42:51.340]   - I probably would split it into two days.
[03:42:51.340 --> 03:42:52.180]   That's the reality of it.
[03:42:52.180 --> 03:42:55.400]   So if you're thinking, man, coach wants me
[03:42:55.400 --> 03:42:57.120]   to train six days a week.
[03:42:57.120 --> 03:42:58.000]   My schedule is tight.
[03:42:58.000 --> 03:43:00.080]   I can pull off four to five.
[03:43:00.080 --> 03:43:00.920]   Okay, great.
[03:43:00.920 --> 03:43:03.420]   What I might say is two of those days
[03:43:03.420 --> 03:43:05.440]   are just your tempo, right?
[03:43:05.440 --> 03:43:06.560]   This is what like a runner would call this,
[03:43:06.560 --> 03:43:09.120]   like tempo training kind of in that space.
[03:43:09.120 --> 03:43:10.960]   - Remind us what tempo training is just for the uninformed.
[03:43:10.960 --> 03:43:13.800]   - It would be this like 60 to 80% effort range
[03:43:13.800 --> 03:43:17.280]   where you're like running at probably the same stride length
[03:43:17.280 --> 03:43:19.280]   and rate that you're going to run your race at,
[03:43:19.280 --> 03:43:21.440]   maybe a little bit lower, but something similar.
[03:43:21.440 --> 03:43:24.720]   You're practicing skill, you're accruing mileage,
[03:43:24.720 --> 03:43:26.720]   and you're getting a little, you're getting work in,
[03:43:26.720 --> 03:43:29.740]   for sure work, but it's not absolutely the fastest
[03:43:29.740 --> 03:43:32.340]   you can sprint and it's also not conversation.
[03:43:32.340 --> 03:43:36.040]   - So this would be the, before we referred to as the
[03:43:36.040 --> 03:43:39.680]   10 minutes of fast running or 10 minutes of fast rowing.
[03:43:39.680 --> 03:43:41.260]   - This is lower intensity than that.
[03:43:41.260 --> 03:43:42.100]   - Got it.
[03:43:42.100 --> 03:43:45.640]   - This is work accumulation.
[03:43:45.640 --> 03:43:46.480]   - Got it.
[03:43:46.480 --> 03:43:47.920]   - This is practice stuff.
[03:43:47.920 --> 03:43:49.460]   Then one of the days a week,
[03:43:49.460 --> 03:43:53.240]   I would probably enter in that 20 second,
[03:43:53.240 --> 03:43:55.400]   30 second burst for a little bit of speed there.
[03:43:55.400 --> 03:43:57.820]   And then one of the other days is when I would do that
[03:43:57.820 --> 03:44:00.080]   true high intensity as hard as I can
[03:44:00.080 --> 03:44:03.460]   for hitting a VO2 max, something like that.
[03:44:03.460 --> 03:44:04.840]   So that's probably how I'd break it up
[03:44:04.840 --> 03:44:06.200]   if I had like four days a week.
[03:44:06.200 --> 03:44:09.480]   If you had five, you can maybe add in another day
[03:44:09.480 --> 03:44:13.700]   where you do more of that volume accumulation practice work.
[03:44:13.700 --> 03:44:15.940]   But that's a pretty good split.
[03:44:15.940 --> 03:44:19.320]   - Well, this is the point in the episode where I say,
[03:44:19.320 --> 03:44:20.600]   thank you ever so much.
[03:44:20.600 --> 03:44:25.040]   You provided an enormous amount of incredibly interesting,
[03:44:25.040 --> 03:44:28.240]   clear information that's also actionable.
[03:44:28.240 --> 03:44:31.400]   I do feel as if I far better understand endurance
[03:44:31.400 --> 03:44:35.480]   in its many forms and even the cellular underpinnings of
[03:44:35.480 --> 03:44:38.680]   that and even subcellular underpinnings of what endurance
[03:44:38.680 --> 03:44:41.360]   adaptations are and how to foster those
[03:44:41.360 --> 03:44:42.640]   through specific protocols,
[03:44:42.640 --> 03:44:44.680]   things that not only I can do tomorrow,
[03:44:44.680 --> 03:44:46.620]   but that I will do tomorrow.
[03:44:46.620 --> 03:44:47.960]   And where I hit my pain points,
[03:44:47.960 --> 03:44:49.740]   I'll understand what's happening
[03:44:49.740 --> 03:44:51.600]   and the adaptation that I'm triggering.
[03:44:51.600 --> 03:44:53.920]   When my legs are burning or I'm sucking for air
[03:44:53.920 --> 03:44:57.120]   through my mouth, or I can calmly move along
[03:44:57.120 --> 03:44:58.400]   just through nasal breathing,
[03:44:58.400 --> 03:45:00.840]   I will now know what's happening in my body
[03:45:00.840 --> 03:45:03.200]   and the specific adaptations that I'm triggering.
[03:45:03.200 --> 03:45:04.520]   I think you also highlight something
[03:45:04.520 --> 03:45:06.780]   that is vitally important.
[03:45:06.780 --> 03:45:09.680]   And I've never heard it phrased as clearly as you did today,
[03:45:09.680 --> 03:45:13.000]   which is that it really doesn't matter how one seeks out
[03:45:13.000 --> 03:45:16.040]   to achieve fat loss provided certain criteria are met.
[03:45:17.480 --> 03:45:20.540]   Even while certain forms of exercise tap into fat stores
[03:45:20.540 --> 03:45:21.840]   more than others.
[03:45:21.840 --> 03:45:25.040]   And you beautifully illustrated the relationship
[03:45:25.040 --> 03:45:27.540]   between energy utilization and breathing
[03:45:27.540 --> 03:45:32.240]   and the fact that we literally exhale fat to some extent.
[03:45:32.240 --> 03:45:33.520]   - Of course.
[03:45:33.520 --> 03:45:36.740]   - So once again, thank you, thank you, and thank you.
[03:45:36.740 --> 03:45:40.240]   I know I'm not alone in recognizing this information
[03:45:40.240 --> 03:45:42.840]   as incredibly interesting and actionable.
[03:45:42.840 --> 03:45:44.800]   And indeed I do plan to put it into action
[03:45:44.800 --> 03:45:48.240]   as I hope many of our listeners will as well.
[03:45:48.240 --> 03:45:50.320]   - Yet again, the pleasure is actually all mine.
[03:45:50.320 --> 03:45:52.340]   And I actually really appreciate the fact
[03:45:52.340 --> 03:45:55.200]   that you let me go so far into metabolism.
[03:45:55.200 --> 03:45:58.000]   My PhD is in human bioenergetics.
[03:45:58.000 --> 03:46:01.500]   So anytime I can go many hours into metabolism,
[03:46:01.500 --> 03:46:05.120]   I get very excited and I don't typically get that leash
[03:46:05.120 --> 03:46:05.960]   in this format.
[03:46:05.960 --> 03:46:06.800]   So I appreciate that.
[03:46:06.800 --> 03:46:10.280]   I know you understand your audience will love that hopefully.
[03:46:10.280 --> 03:46:11.400]   - Oh, they'll love it.
[03:46:11.400 --> 03:46:13.120]   And I think that they'll especially love it
[03:46:13.120 --> 03:46:18.120]   because they understand that if one can wrap their head
[03:46:18.120 --> 03:46:21.220]   around even just a small fraction of the mechanisms
[03:46:21.220 --> 03:46:23.120]   that underlie a given protocol,
[03:46:23.120 --> 03:46:25.760]   it gives both tremendous depth and meaning to that protocol
[03:46:25.760 --> 03:46:28.260]   and makes it so much more flexible for people
[03:46:28.260 --> 03:46:30.060]   that can really think about what's happening
[03:46:30.060 --> 03:46:32.060]   as they're engaging in a given protocol
[03:46:32.060 --> 03:46:35.520]   and know exactly what they can expect in terms of results.
[03:46:35.520 --> 03:46:36.360]   - Great.
[03:46:36.360 --> 03:46:38.060]   We've been on a bit of a journey here.
[03:46:38.060 --> 03:46:41.000]   We've covered a lot of ground with speed development
[03:46:41.000 --> 03:46:42.760]   and strength and hypertrophy.
[03:46:42.760 --> 03:46:45.600]   And now we walk through probably several hours here
[03:46:45.600 --> 03:46:46.960]   of endurance.
[03:46:46.960 --> 03:46:50.880]   What I would love to do next is to just give you
[03:46:50.880 --> 03:46:54.520]   a more straightforward, not as much background,
[03:46:54.520 --> 03:46:57.560]   not as much metabolism, none of the mechanisms
[03:46:57.560 --> 03:47:00.480]   right into protocols for someone who says,
[03:47:00.480 --> 03:47:02.880]   look, I wanna hit those marks you keep talking about.
[03:47:02.880 --> 03:47:04.240]   I wanna look good.
[03:47:04.240 --> 03:47:05.120]   I wanna feel good.
[03:47:05.120 --> 03:47:07.120]   And I wanna do that across my lifespan.
[03:47:07.120 --> 03:47:11.400]   How would I build all these things into a protocol
[03:47:11.400 --> 03:47:14.560]   that actually covers maybe the entire year?
[03:47:14.560 --> 03:47:16.640]   And how would I would be able to repeat that year after year?
[03:47:16.640 --> 03:47:19.800]   So I almost have this evergreen, sustainable,
[03:47:19.800 --> 03:47:21.920]   year long periodization structure
[03:47:21.920 --> 03:47:24.160]   that covers all the nodes I need to
[03:47:24.160 --> 03:47:26.660]   if I want everything we've talked about
[03:47:26.660 --> 03:47:29.120]   in these nine adaptations in this short series.
[03:47:29.120 --> 03:47:33.080]   So I would love to do that in our next conversation.

[03:47:59.700 --> 03:48:01.520]   at the beginning and during today's episode.
[03:48:01.520 --> 03:48:03.960]   That's the best way to support this podcast.
[03:48:03.960 --> 03:48:04.920]   I'd also like to inform you
[03:48:04.920 --> 03:48:07.440]   about the Huberman Lab Podcast free newsletter.
[03:48:07.440 --> 03:48:09.240]   It's called the Neural Network Newsletter
[03:48:09.240 --> 03:48:12.240]   and each month the Neural Network Newsletter is sent out
[03:48:12.240 --> 03:48:14.700]   and it contains summaries of podcast episodes,
[03:48:14.700 --> 03:48:17.600]   specific protocols discussed on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[03:48:17.600 --> 03:48:21.440]   all in fairly concise format and all completely zero cost.
[03:48:21.440 --> 03:48:23.140]   You can sign up for the Neural Network Newsletter
[03:48:23.140 --> 03:48:24.860]   by going to HubermanLab.com,
[03:48:24.860 --> 03:48:26.800]   go to the menu and click on newsletter.
[03:48:26.800 --> 03:48:27.820]   You provide us your email.
[03:48:27.820 --> 03:48:29.440]   We do not share it with anybody.
[03:48:29.440 --> 03:48:31.880]   And as I mentioned before, it's completely zero cost.
[03:48:31.880 --> 03:48:33.680]   By going to HubermanLab.com,
[03:48:33.680 --> 03:48:36.460]   you can also go into the menu tab and go to newsletter
[03:48:36.460 --> 03:48:39.200]   and see some example newsletters from months past.
[03:48:39.200 --> 03:48:41.460]   Thank you once again for joining me for today's discussion
[03:48:41.460 --> 03:48:43.420]   about fitness, exercise and performance
[03:48:43.420 --> 03:48:44.920]   with Dr. Andy Galpin.
[03:48:44.920 --> 03:48:47.900]   And as always, thank you for your interest in science.
[03:48:47.900 --> 03:48:50.480]   (upbeat music)
[03:48:50.480 --> 03:48:53.060]   (upbeat music)
