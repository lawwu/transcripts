[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.240]   I have two related questions for you today, Pastor John, joining us over the phone today.
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.720]   Back in 1981, in a sermon on wisdom, you said this, and it's a rather curious thing, so
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.240]   I want your thoughts on it.
[00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.240]   "God has created this world and its moral laws in such a way that the more we choose
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.160]   to glorify God, the happier we will be."
[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.740]   That sounds different to my ear.
[00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.440]   My question is, would you say that same thing today, looking back?
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.880]   Is this how Christian hedonism should be expressed, that God created this world and its moral
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:46.680]   laws in such a way that the more we choose to glorify God, the happier we will be?
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.880]   And while we're at it, what did you think of Kevin Young's recent tweet where he wrote,
[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:59.640]   "We will only be most satisfied when we delight in God being most glorified."
[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.680]   He seems to want to adjust your favorite sentence.
[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.160]   Yes, yes, he does seem to want to tweak my sentence.
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.680]   I love Kevin Young.
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.280]   I'll get to Kevin in a minute, but let's take these questions one at a time.
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:20.440]   First, that sentence from 1981, "The more we choose to glorify God, the happier we will
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.440]   be."
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.080]   That sentence is almost the flip-flopping of my usual sentence.
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.640]   I like to say, and I think it's the heart of Christian hedonism, indeed the heart of
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:39.800]   the Christian life, that God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him.
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:47.960]   And that 1981 sentence could be paraphrased, "We are most satisfied in God when God is
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.120]   most glorified in us."
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.760]   And would I say that today?
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.440]   And here's my answer.
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:00.200]   As long as we make clear that the "we" that we're talking about is the body of Christ,
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:08.320]   those who are born again, the answer is yes, I could say that we are most satisfied in
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.960]   God when God is most glorified in us.
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.600]   I could say that.
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:20.440]   The mark of being born again is to be sure that we fall out of love with self-promotion
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:28.000]   and self-exaltation, and we fall into love with God-promotion and God-exaltation and
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.280]   God-glorification.
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:36.280]   We are glad, we are satisfied when this happens, God being glorified.
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:43.080]   In Romans 1:23, Paul shows that the natural man—that is, those who are not born again
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:49.880]   by the Spirit through faith in Jesus—the natural man exchanges the glory of the immortal
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:50.880]   God for images.
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.160]   In other words, they don't find their highest treasure and their greatest pleasure in the
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.160]   glory of God.
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.680]   And so verse 21 says, "Although they knew God, they did not glorify Him."
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.480]   They did not glorify Him as God or give thanks to Him.
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:14.120]   So one of the fundamental distinctives of the person who is no longer a natural person
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:21.920]   but a born-again new creation is that we stop exchanging the glory of God for images like
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.880]   ourselves, the one we see in the mirror, and we delight in God being glorified.
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:33.680]   We love it if our going low can make God go high.
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:42.140]   So it's true, it's true that we are most satisfied in God when God is most glorified in us.
[00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:48.240]   It makes a Christian glad to see God magnified.
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:56.560]   And the more we see God and His Son magnified and glorified, the more satisfied we feel.
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:05.160]   Now, having said, "Yes," having said that I still believe that and can say that's true,
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:13.680]   I add this, no, I don't emphasize that when I am describing Christian hedonism.
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.720]   And here's the reason.
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:25.440]   To the average person listening to that sentence that we are more satisfied when God is more
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:35.880]   glorified, it communicates that our glorifying God is one thing, and our being satisfied
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.760]   in God or enjoying God is a separate thing from glorifying God.
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:46.100]   It's a response, it's a response to glorifying God.
[00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:52.000]   And as long as people are thinking only in those categories, they'll never understand
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   Christian hedonism.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.840]   They won't understand what it is, and they won't get to the heart of what it means for
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.620]   them to glorify God.
[00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:11.800]   The primary burden of Christian hedonism is to push and push and push on the truth that
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:21.360]   most people don't think about, namely, that their very enjoyment of God as God, the beauty
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:28.880]   of God, the loveliness of God, the perfections of God, that their very enjoyment of God is
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:36.720]   not only their response to God's being glorified, it is the way they glorify Him.
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:37.720]   There it is.
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.760]   It's the way they glorify Him.
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:47.280]   And oh, how I wish I could make this clear and compelling and help people feel the wonder
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.960]   and the force and the vast implications of this.
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.360]   So let me say it again.
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:06:02.000]   The primary burden of Christian hedonism, the biblical truth that is so often neglected
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:10.400]   that I'm trying to lift and wave like a banner from the housetops is that our joy is not
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:20.240]   only—I'm admitting the truth now—is not only a response to seeing God glorified, but
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:28.200]   our joy in God is an essential part of the way we glorify God.
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:38.840]   Christian hedonism says that by means of enjoying God as God, we make God look valuable.
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:47.840]   And if we only say that the exaltation of God as valuable makes us happy, instead of
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:55.480]   also saying that our happiness in God is what exalts Him, we haven't yet grasped what is
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:07:00.080]   at the heart of Christian worship and Christian living.
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.680]   So let me say again that my 1981 sentence is technically true.
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:11.640]   Here's what I said, "The more we choose to glorify God, the happier we will be."
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.760]   Technically, yes, true.
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:21.540]   But I think it is also misleading because it gives the impression that the only connection
[00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:30.000]   between happiness, my happiness, and glorifying God is that happiness is a response to God
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:38.400]   being glorified, when in fact my happiness in God is a means of God's being glorified.
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:45.240]   That is the essence of Christian hedonism, that my happiness in God is a means of God
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:47.340]   being glorified.
[00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:53.360]   And that is what I hope to clarify and commend with every breath I have for the rest of my
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:54.360]   life.
[00:07:54.360 --> 00:08:04.680]   Now, what about my good friend whom I love so much and trust dearly, deeply, Kevin DeYoung's
[00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:10.920]   tinkering with my favorite sentence, "God is most glorified in us when we're most satisfied
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:19.800]   in Him," by saying—here's what he tweeted—"We will only be most satisfied when we delight
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:23.560]   in God being most glorified."
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.920]   That's tricky in my answer.
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:31.920]   I think Kevin's sentence is a version of my 1981 sentence.
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:34.000]   It is true.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:41.400]   If we don't delight in God being glorified, we are definitely not going to be most satisfied.
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:42.860]   So he's right.
[00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:52.720]   So his sentence is absolutely true, but it does not clarify what I have given my life
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:55.320]   to trying to clarify.
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:59.200]   So I'll say one last time what the difference is.
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:10.160]   It is right and good always to be glad when God's glory is exalted, however it happens.
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.560]   Yes, and amen.
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:20.480]   But the heart of Christian hedonism is more radical and pervasive in its effect on all
[00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:21.680]   we do.
[00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:32.160]   It says that we ourselves will never glorify God as we ought to unless we are satisfied
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.760]   in Him as we ought to be.
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:47.560]   Being satisfied in God as our supreme treasure is not only a response to seeing Him glorified,
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:54.840]   but the way He is glorified in us, and that changes everything.
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:55.840]   Amen.
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:10:03.320]   This changes everything, and it is the message driving everything that we say and do at DesiringGod.org.
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:05.640]   Pastor John, thank you.
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.800]   And listeners, thank you for supporting our labors.
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.560]   It is not without tension.
[00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:10.840]   It is not without pushback.
[00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:13.680]   It is not without resistance, and that's okay.
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:20.360]   The work goes on, and we appeal to people all across the globe to glorify God by treasuring
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.960]   God above all else in this world.
