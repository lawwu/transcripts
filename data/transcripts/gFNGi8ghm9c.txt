[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.780]   Happy Friday.
[00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:09.580]   Today's question comes from a young man who listens regularly.
[00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.060]   "Hello Pastor John, thanks for the podcast.
[00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.320]   Here's the dilemma I face right now.
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:20.980]   My wife's best friend is also a lesbian and was recently engaged to marry another woman.
[00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.580]   My wife and I are unified in our decision that we will not be able to attend their wedding
[00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.220]   based on all the things you talked about back in episode 191.
[00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.760]   However we have heterosexual friends who are getting married too who are currently living
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.600]   together and sleeping together before marriage.
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.200]   I think we would attend this wedding without hesitation but my question to you is this,
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.720]   are we inconsistent to not attend a homosexual wedding because we do not affirm their sexual
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:52.200]   lifestyle yet be willing to attend a heterosexual wedding of unbelievers whose lifestyle of
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.640]   premarital sex we also cannot affirm?"
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.720]   Pastor John, what would you say to this couple?
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:08.000]   It may be or it may not be inconsistent depending on other factors.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:16.760]   So let me draw out something that may be implicit in what this young man is asking and the paths
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:24.000]   of relationship he's pursuing or not with both kinds of couples.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:32.400]   What I would want to be sure to say is that not attending the so-called wedding of a so-called
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:40.760]   marriage between two men or two women is not the last word about the relationship that
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.320]   you may have with these people.
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.480]   In other words, it may be exactly the right thing to do.
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:52.120]   I think it generally is not to be affirming of that kind of relationship by attending
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:02:00.180]   that ceremony and yet it may be the right thing to do to continue showing principled
[00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:06.560]   kindness to those folks in the hope of revealing the truth of Christ.
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:15.240]   So I just want to make sure that not attending the ceremony is not the entire extent of our
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.760]   moral duty in Christ toward these people.
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.120]   If they are professing Christians, that makes the relationship all the more difficult and
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:35.000]   complicated since the Bible says we are to disassociate from brothers, professing brothers,
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.240]   who live in this kind of sin, 1 Corinthians 5:11.
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:46.640]   But if they are not professing Christians, there may be numerous ways in which we can
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:53.400]   extend the grace of God toward them in the hope of conversion.
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:01.520]   And similarly, with regard to the heterosexual couple whose wedding we do attend, that should
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:10.200]   not be conceived of as the last thing we do to put truth in their lives or to bring exhortation
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.600]   and admonition and conviction for their sin.
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:24.720]   Now having said all that, I think it is ordinarily wrong to attend the ceremony of the so-called
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:33.320]   gay marriage, but ordinarily right to attend the ceremony of a couple who has been living
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:41.520]   in sin but is marrying, or in marrying or not in principle sinning.
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:47.860]   In the first case, the ceremony is a celebration of sinful behavior, and in the other case
[00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:53.720]   it is not necessarily a celebration of sinful behavior.
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:59.720]   That's why it's not inconsistent to go to the one and not the other.
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:06.000]   But there is a complicating factor that I should bring up, which the questioner may
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.560]   or may not have thought of.
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:17.840]   The issue concerning this second couple's relation to God is not mainly their past behavior,
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.600]   past sexual sin, but their present convictions.
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:30.820]   If they are moving away from fornication because they are now persuaded it is sin, and they
[00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:39.800]   are marrying as a declaration of repentance and faith in Christ and a commitment to righteousness,
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:48.880]   then they are right with God, and we should join them in the penitent and happy celebration.
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:57.640]   But it is possible that they are not at all persuaded that having sex together as an engaged
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.160]   couple is sin.
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.360]   Maybe they would do it all over again, same way.
[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:11.720]   Many in our day, tragically many, are deluded about this because of how superficially they
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.560]   submit to Scripture.
[00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.720]   They don't submit themselves to God's authority in Scripture.
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:24.480]   They just do what they feel like doing and assume God is okay with it, like sleeping
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:29.440]   together before they're married because they think they're committed to each other.
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:38.520]   It is clear from Scripture that not only is adultery sin, sexual unfaithfulness in marriage,
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:44.760]   but sexual relations before marriage is sin as well.
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.640]   That's clear.
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:55.560]   The very term "sexual immorality," as it's used in Matthew 15, 19, Hebrews 13, 4, Ephesians
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:04.640]   5, 5, 1 Corinthians 5, 11, 1 Corinthians 6, 9, 7, 1, and 2—1 Corinthians 7, verses 1
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:09.920]   and 2—all refer to fornication or sexual relations before marriage.
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:16.360]   It is good—this is what Paul says—it is good for a man not to have sexual relations
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:23.160]   with a woman, but because of the temptation to sexual immorality, each man should have
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.440]   his own wife and each woman her own husband.
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:32.200]   That's a clear teaching that if you don't have a husband, if you don't have a wife,
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:39.740]   then to have sexual relations is outside the bounds of God's revealed will.
[00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:44.440]   So if the couple that we're talking about here, whose wedding you're going to attend,
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:52.000]   if the couple has only stopped doing the act of fornication, but have not stopped believing
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:58.760]   that fornication is right, then they probably, if they belong to a Bible-believing church,
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:04.080]   they probably are in a position where they should be disciplined.
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:10.820]   Because we don't just discipline people for unrepentant actions of sinning, but also
[00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:17.880]   for unrepentant belief that sin is right or permissible.
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:23.360]   The reason for this is that believing that sinful behavior is permissible means, according
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:32.960]   to 1 Corinthians 6:9, that we endorse patterns of behavior that destroy souls, which is like
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:36.480]   murder, murder in our heart.
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:40.840]   Those who do such things will not enter the kingdom of heaven, Paul says.
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:46.020]   And he's talking about fornication, not just homosexuality.
[00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:52.440]   And what complicates the question being asked, then, is that if the couple who approve of
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:58.200]   fornication—they don't think it's wrong for an engaged couple to have sex—if the
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:06.200]   couple who approve of fornication are professing Christians, then the Bible says, 1 Corinthians
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:15.500]   5:11, "I am writing to you not to associate with anyone who bears the name 'brother'
[00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:22.320]   if he is guilty of sexual immorality, not even to eat with such a one."
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:25.000]   And then you'd have to ask, "Well, should I go to the wedding?
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.740]   I can't even go to the reception."
[00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:33.000]   So the question is not merely whether the marriage ceremony is appropriate, which it
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.240]   is in and of itself.
[00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:43.440]   The question is also whether the couple endorses a lifestyle of fornication during engagement,
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:48.640]   which the Bible says imperils people's souls.
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:55.000]   All of these thoughts, everything I've said in answer to this question, show that the
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:01.640]   issues we are dealing with are deeper than simple attendance at ceremonies, and they
[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:09.600]   involve us in a kind of messy mixture of compassion and confrontation that is never easy.
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:15.440]   Thank you, Pastor John, for tackling such controversial subjects consistently, and thanks
