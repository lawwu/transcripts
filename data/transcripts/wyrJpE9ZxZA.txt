[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.480]   This week we are joined on the Ask Pastor John podcast with Dr. Richard Lentz, who is
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.120]   the author of a fascinating book that releases this winter titled Identity and Idolatry,
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.580]   the image of God and its inversion. It's published in Don Carson's series, New Studies
[00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.960]   in Biblical Theology. And Dr. Lentz, as you mentioned earlier, connecting with others
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.960]   in community is essential for us to understand who we are. By definition, our identity must
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:36.160]   be found outside of us. And we talked about this on Monday in episode number 674. So what
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:42.120]   do our digital communities offer us or not offer us by way of discovering who we really
[00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.120]   are?
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.200]   Yeah, I think we're a little early in the revolution to know for sure. There's surely
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:54.880]   enough hints that tell us the relationships that are simply digital relationships online
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:01.800]   are pretty thin and not substantive. Now, that's not always the case. And I want to
[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:10.840]   be careful that we don't overgeneralize here. But broadly speaking, the sheer number of
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.880]   relationships that we are given and granted access to by virtue of living in the digital
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:23.760]   age means that none of them can be very thick. None of them can be very rich, the result
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:31.160]   of which we live on the surface of each other's lives. And so there was a season probably,
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:39.000]   I want to say, five, seven years ago, where we thought Facebook would eventually be replaced.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.320]   Those that had grown up with Facebook were beginning to recognize that it was all about
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:51.400]   image and impression and very thin slices of other people's lives. The strange thing
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:58.680]   is that it actually hasn't gone away. It actually has mutated and migrated and that
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:06.120]   people at different ends of the age spectrum, the grandparent stage, as well as the teenager
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:12.760]   stage are even more addicted to it, the statistics suggest. So what we recognize is that living
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:20.100]   on the surface of our lives can be very attractive because it appears not to be very costly.
[00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.240]   We don't really have to wrestle with the deep things, but it's also deeply unsatisfying.
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:32.600]   So we're always expecting something more. And like an idol that doesn't deliver on
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:39.120]   its promises, we, instead of abandoning the idol, actually keep going back to it, hoping
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:45.280]   that it will give us more. And so there is this, again, critical exchange that takes
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.640]   place between ourselves and the world around us. We keep yearning for it to deliver something
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:57.520]   it can't deliver. And so rather than returning to the living God as the source of our safety
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:04.160]   and our security, we keep going back and asking the idol to do more for us. And so, again,
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:11.040]   I want to be cautious of saying Facebook is somehow evil, that our smartphones are fundamentally
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:19.360]   destructive. It's the dynamic that we allow them to play that is more nearly my concern.
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.960]   Yeah, that's a really good caution. And yet so much of life online is crafting and preserving
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:30.680]   a reputation of ourselves. We offer the online world an edited version of ourselves. So how
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.240]   does this relate to idolatry and identity?
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:43.080]   Yeah, that's a what a great question. How do we create identities? Most of us are aware
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:51.760]   of this dynamic of creating an impression, a reputation. We are acutely aware in our
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:58.880]   cultural context of what other people think of us. We compare ourselves to others. I think
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:07.440]   that's always been true. But this speed with which that takes place in our lives is enormously
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:15.360]   faster than it once was. So we are aware how fragile, therefore, our identity is if we
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:23.880]   are constantly comparing ourselves to a changing world, to changing relationships, to not simply
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:32.920]   a finite set of friends, but to a virtually infinite set of acquaintances online. And
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:38.240]   there's always somebody that's going to do something better than what you can do. I don't
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:44.480]   care what it is, there's always somebody. And therefore, if that's the comparison, you're
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:50.080]   always going to have some sense of insecurity. And the question is, how do you deal with
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:58.080]   those insecurities? How do you deal with that sense of safety? And I think it's not a dilemma
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.480]   here, let me sound as pessimistic as I can, that we're ever going to solve on this side
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:10.120]   of eternity. It's part of a fallen world. But the optimism here, and kind of heading
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:19.680]   towards the gospel now, is grace actually turns that dynamic upside down to its original,
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:30.720]   yet better form. And so the challenge of living in a online age is just the sheer rapidity,
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:39.400]   the overwhelming number of people that we can compare ourselves to, the number of impressions.
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:44.560]   And so we are as guilty of this as all the contemporary sociologists remind us in the
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.920]   evangelical world. We are, in fact, really good in the evangelical world of creating
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:06:00.000]   celebrities, creating impressions, creating images that are crafted and which undermine
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:07.040]   our senses of significance and security. So we want to be very careful, those of us who
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:15.760]   are oriented to the gospel, oriented to see God as the living God, we are also prone to
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:24.440]   our own forms of idolatry. Not uncommon, if you read the scriptures, that it is God's
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:31.680]   people that often come under the sharpest indictment of idolatry. And so we need to
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:39.480]   be careful as well that somehow the impression we give to people is that if you come to Jesus,
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:47.840]   if you reckon with your own brokenness, that that therefore will end this dynamic of idolatry.
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:54.880]   It doesn't. It surely reminds us that our Savior is not ourselves. It does lie outside
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:55.880]   of us.
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:01.560]   Yeah, that is true and sobering. Thank you, Dr. Lentz. And we have time for one more episode,
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:05.080]   and we need to turn towards gospel hope in the digital age, and we're going to do that
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:10.120]   more tomorrow. We've started in that direction, and we need to keep going. For everything
