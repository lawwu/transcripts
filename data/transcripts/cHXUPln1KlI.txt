[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - Obviously the flu can be deadly in some circumstances,
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.980]   but for most people that are healthy, generally healthy,
[00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.100]   first of all, how concerning is flu?
[00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.440]   Like, should I really be concerned about flu
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.680]   this winter season, even though I feel robust?
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.280]   And then the second question is,
[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.060]   do you personally get the quote unquote flu shot?
[00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.580]   I said on a previous podcast that I don't get it,
[00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.640]   and I took a lot of heat for that.
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.380]   I understand that the flu shot does protect
[00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.860]   against certain forms of flu, not all of them.
[00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.000]   That statement was kind of pushed out there
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.200]   by folks saying that I was going against CDC guidelines.
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.640]   I'm not going against CDC guidelines.
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:43.720]   People should do as they choose.
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.080]   They should just know what they're doing.
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.560]   I've never gotten a flu shot.
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.140]   I don't know if I've ever gotten the flu,
[00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.560]   but that's my personal choice,
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.920]   and it's not based on any specific fear of the flu shot.
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.840]   It's because it's never been an issue for me,
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.840]   and I'm okay with getting a cold or a flu
[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.000]   every couple of years,
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.440]   feeling miserable for a week or two, and bouncing back.
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.400]   I feel like that's good to develop my own antibodies,
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.240]   but maybe I'm thinking about this completely irrationally.
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.000]   So do you get the flu shot?
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.280]   Do you recommend the flu shot for healthy people?
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.440]   Do you recommend the flu shot
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.480]   for people that are metabolically challenged?
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.840]   - Yeah, it's a good question.
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.920]   I think it's, and the approach that I take
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.360]   is the approach that I take
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.120]   with any intervention in medicine.
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.200]   Every intervention in medicine has a benefit,
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.640]   and every intervention has a risk, no matter what it is.
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.760]   So for me, because I work in an intensive care unit
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.440]   around sick patients all the time,
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.600]   I'm exposed to a lot of flu.
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.000]   I mean, you literally walk in, and the next day they say,
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.160]   "Oh, by the way, that guy, yeah, he had the flu."
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.220]   So you find out after the fact.
[00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.480]   So for me, I've always, since I've been a physician,
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.580]   I've always gotten the flu shot every single year.
[00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.520]   - Do you get it multiple times per season?
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.360]   - No, just once.
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.600]   - Okay, so at the beginning of the flu season,
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.360]   when they say, "Flu shot available now."
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.080]   So it's a mix of antibodies
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.400]   against known strains of the flu.
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.680]   - Yeah, interesting.
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.000]   The way that they try to figure out or guess the way it is,
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.400]   because that's what it is, it's a guess,
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.800]   is they look six months earlier
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.040]   to see what happened in the Southern hemisphere,
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.360]   and they see what was circulating there,
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.560]   and then they believe that's what's gonna be circulating
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.400]   in the Northern hemisphere.
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.960]   And they do the same in the South.
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.240]   They look and see what's circulating up here,
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.120]   and they try to figure out what is gonna be there.
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.040]   So there's usually about three or four different ones
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.840]   that they try to put in there.
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.160]   Ever since 2009, they've tried to put one in there
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.240]   about 2009, because that was a really bad year.
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.360]   We mentioned that in terms of that study on sunlight,
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.920]   but in terms of the side effects as a result of that,
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.040]   it's been pretty bad.
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.480]   I mean, to give you an example,
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.160]   I had a patient recently in the intensive care unit.
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.400]   This patient came in, very poorly controlled diabetes,
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.000]   hemoglobin A1C of like 16, 17, it was very bad.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.200]   And she developed, she got the flu,
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.540]   and her immune system was not well.
[00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.700]   She actually also got a very bad fungal infection
[00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.380]   that was near fatal.
[00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.640]   And so that's the typical patient that we're gonna see
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.840]   who's gonna have that type of a bad reaction to the flu.
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.960]   People who are immunocompromised,
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.560]   people who are not metabolically healthy,
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.880]   these are the ones that are wide open.
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.880]   And so a flu virus is going to do a lot of damage there.
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.880]   So what does the flu vaccine do?
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.440]   It gives the immune system an advanced notice
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.980]   of what this antigen is.
[00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.640]   And that has two effects.
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.420]   What a lot of people believe is that it's gonna protect you
[00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.300]   from ever getting infected.
[00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:33.420]   That's not the case.
[00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:34.940]   You can still get infected,
[00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.740]   but what happens is that the symptomatology
[00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.220]   or the side effects of that infection
[00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.040]   will be greatly diminished.
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.140]   So instead of you being hospitalized, perhaps,
[00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.700]   maybe you're only coming down with the flu
[00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:47.780]   and you stay at home.
[00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.560]   A lot of people would say, "I got the flu shot
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.480]   and it didn't help, I got the flu anyway."
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.380]   What we don't know is how severe that infection
[00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.040]   would have been in the first place.
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.640]   So that's why, for people who are immunocompromised,
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.040]   I generally recommend it to get the flu shot.
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.800]   - Or people that are exposed to a lot of flu,
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.240]   because like you, you work in the ICU.
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:10.240]   But, and if I may, do your kids get the flu shot?
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.080]   - Yeah, we give them the flu shot as well.
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.120]   It's more because they're the kids of doctors
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.840]   who might bring home the flu more than anything else.
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.960]   But there was a point where we were not doing it.
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.160]   When they're in their teenage years,
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.200]   that's when we start actually giving them the flu shot.
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.280]   That was just a personal opinion,
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.200]   even though I know it's approved
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.240]   down to six months of age, I believe.
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.280]   - So you started your kids
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.560]   once they were in their teen years?
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:34.840]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.960]   I remember one year, our son, Ryan,
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.480]   he got some virus, I don't know what it was,
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.360]   but he had very bad diarrhea.
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.520]   And we had to take him to the emergency room
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.120]   to actually get an IV and get fluids into him.
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.960]   He was very dehydrated.
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.080]   I don't know what that was.
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.400]   I don't know if it was rotavirus,
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.080]   but something was going around that year.
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.920]   So, and he's perfectly healthy.
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.580]   So this is something that can happen.
[00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.800]   And you just have to look at the risks and benefits.
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.080]   - So if, well, I am telling you
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.920]   that I've never gotten a flu shot.
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.280]   Am I being irresponsible as a citizen?
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.400]   I don't tend, I mean, I go places, I go to restaurants,
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.200]   I go to the gym, I've remained healthy for the most part.
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.640]   I'm in an occasional sniffle here and there.
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.080]   Every couple of years, I'll get,
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.640]   it's been a long time actually, now that I think about it.
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.600]   - I think irresponsible is probably too strong of a word.
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.600]   The way I look at things
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.760]   is through what I call the Swiss cheese model.
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.520]   I don't know if you've ever heard of the Swiss cheese model.
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:29.360]   - I love Swiss cheese.
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.600]   - Okay, so the Swiss cheese model says this.
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.480]   Every, if I cut up a bunch of pieces of Swiss cheese,
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.680]   you'll know that every piece has a hole in it, right?
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.120]   Or maybe a couple of holes.
[00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.760]   And if you line up those pieces of Swiss cheese,
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.080]   those holes might be in different places.
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.640]   So if you are, let's say you're on one end of those
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.400]   multiple slices of Swiss cheese
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.160]   and little particles are coming through.
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.680]   If you have enough pieces of those Swiss cheese,
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.560]   no particles are gonna get through.
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.680]   And that's really what we look at in medicine.
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.840]   We don't just depend on one slice of Swiss cheese.
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.680]   Like in the operating room, for instance,
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.000]   we don't wanna have infections.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:04.840]   So what do we do?
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.720]   We sterilize the instruments.
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.000]   But we don't just leave it there, right?
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.680]   We sterilize the skin that we're going to incise.
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.560]   We make sure that the room is the right temperature,
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.360]   the right humidity, because that has an effect.
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.400]   We make sure it's under positive pressure.
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.960]   The surgeon is wearing a mask.
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.200]   He's also wearing sterile gloves.
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.480]   So we go through, we try to do everything
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.760]   that we can possibly do so that if there is a breakdown
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.720]   in one place, we still have a bunch of other
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.640]   Swiss cheese slices in place.
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:31.160]   It's the same thing with the flu and new start.
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.760]   So nutrition, exercise, water, all of those things.
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.120]   And then at the end, when you've done that for yourself,
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.640]   if you wanna have extra protection,
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.480]   you wanna add on another piece of Swiss cheese,
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.240]   then you, well, you can talk to your doctor,
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.000]   see what the risks and the benefits are,
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.160]   and then make that decision
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.240]   if that's something that's right for you.
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.320]   - Are there any known risks of the so-called flu shot?
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.000]   And if so, what's the percentage risk?
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.080]   - Yeah, well, definitely there are risks
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.520]   in terms of allergies.
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.760]   So they should be asking you when you get it,
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.800]   have you ever been allergic to the flu shot before?
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.200]   I mean, you can have anaphylactic shock.
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.480]   That's one possibility.
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.960]   Of course, you can have that with anything, right?
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.360]   But specifically to the flu,
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.640]   there was actually, interestingly, one year,
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.040]   and I can't remember which year it was,
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.320]   but there was a, I think it was in Europe,
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.640]   and we actually never got it in the United States,
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:21.360]   but there was a rash of narcolepsy that was occurring.
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:26.040]   So something about the flu vaccine was causing a reaction
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.840]   that was causing an autoimmune response,
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.240]   and the antibodies, they believe,
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:34.240]   were acting against where hypocretin is made
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:38.120]   in the brain, hypothalamus.
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:41.400]   And so they noticed that there was an association.
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:44.040]   I don't know if they actually determined that it was causal,
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:46.560]   but they stopped that brand.
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:49.200]   - I would not want narcolepsy.
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.320]   I used to work in a laboratory for a summer
[00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:52.920]   that studied narcolepsy.
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:55.560]   It was the Laboratory Emmanuel Mignon's lab
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.340]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:00.120]   He and his colleague, Seiji Nishino,
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:03.920]   identified the hypocretin-orexin mutation
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.400]   as the source of narcolepsy.
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:07.360]   And people with narcolepsy,
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.440]   people think it's just excessive daytime sleepiness,
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:13.600]   but anytime they have it, in the extreme examples,
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.120]   when people with narcolepsy
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:18.280]   have any kind of emotional activation, they fall asleep.
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:20.820]   And they have cataplexy too, so they can't drive.
[00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:25.600]   They become essentially paralyzed, like a sleep atonia.
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:26.600]   Pretty devastating disease.
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:30.120]   So it sounds like that particular strain of the flu shot
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:33.000]   in Europe was neurotoxic in some way.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.400]   - Yeah, there was one particular strain.
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.920]   We'd never seen it before, never seen it since.
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:41.320]   And so yeah, there are these one-offs, right?
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.120]   But everything has risks.
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:45.480]   And so the example that I give is,
[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:47.080]   look, I'm in the ICU all day,
[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:50.120]   and I'm seeing people occasionally with head bleeds,
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:52.200]   and they're on a blood thinner.
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:55.120]   But I don't go back to my clinic in the pulmonary office
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:57.200]   and then take everybody off of blood thinners,
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.640]   because we know that blood thinners, epidemiologically,
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:01.800]   in the long run, actually save lives
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.960]   because they prevent strokes, heart attacks,
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:04.800]   things of that nature.
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:07.280]   So what we try to do is figure out
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:10.040]   what's the right individual for this medication,
[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:14.120]   or what's the right medicine for this type of situation.
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:17.360]   And that requires training.
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:19.400]   And that requires, sometimes you have calculators
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.640]   that can figure out these risks.
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:25.240]   - In the winter months when flu levels are high,
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:27.160]   are you wearing a mask from the moment you walk
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.760]   into the clinic in the morning until when you leave?
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.960]   When you walk up to a new patient,
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:33.960]   if you know they have a flu,
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:38.000]   or if you know they don't have the flu, are you masked up?
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.280]   I mean, this became a big issue around the COVID discussion,
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:47.520]   but to what extent does wearing a conventional mask,
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:50.840]   or even an N95, actually protect you from flu?
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.400]   - Yeah, so the regular surgical masks
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.080]   are very good at preventing things
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:58.520]   from coming out of your mouth and going to other people,
[00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:00.560]   or coming onto your mouth if you happen to have one on.
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:02.520]   So in our clinic where we work,
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:06.120]   we actually look at the flu incidents.
[00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:08.120]   And then we see if it's rising,
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.720]   everybody that comes into that place,
[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:14.240]   physicians, patients, everybody puts a mask on to reduce that.
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:16.320]   N95s are a little different in that
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:21.000]   they don't prevent viruses from coming out of somebody.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.240]   You may notice when you put an N95 mask on,
[00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:25.160]   they may even have a valve that pops open,
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:29.160]   and gas can come out, respiratory air can come out,
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:30.520]   or comes out the sides.
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:33.040]   It's when you take a breath in and it seals,
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.400]   now it's filtering that air.
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:37.200]   So N95s are very good for people
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.880]   who don't wanna get infection
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:40.640]   and don't have respiratory issues,
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:44.400]   because you're now having to breathe air in through a filter
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:45.720]   that takes a little bit more work.
[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:50.600]   If someone has COPD, which is an obstructive lung disease,
[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:51.720]   or other lung diseases,
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.200]   that might not be the best thing to have in those situations.
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:56.920]   So, yeah, I do wear a mask.
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:58.040]   I was very careful.
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:59.960]   I know I was coming on your show this winter time,
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:02.320]   and I was like, "There's no way I wanna get the flu
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:05.640]   "and miss getting on to see you."
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:06.480]   So, yeah, I wore a mask.
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:09.680]   Well, thank you for not, for avoiding bringing flu here.
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:12.040]   It's wild because ever since I started this podcast,
[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:13.960]   we put out now two episodes a week,
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:15.440]   full-length episodes on Mondays
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.720]   and the shorter essential episodes on Thursdays.
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:20.640]   So, I can't afford to get sick.
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.240]   Yeah, and I haven't been sick in years.
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:25.280]   I take care to not get sick,
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:27.000]   but I'm gonna think real carefully
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.680]   about this flu shot thing.
[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:29.960]   What about hand-washing?
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:30.920]   Is that?
[00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:33.400]   So, a friend, let me give a little bit of backstory.
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:37.340]   The guy I worked for as a postdoc was an MD, PhD,
[00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:39.520]   and he used to joke about the fact
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:40.860]   that hand-washing did nothing,
[00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:44.440]   because he was, in his prior life, he was a surgeon.
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:48.040]   He did a, I think he did a rotation, a surgery rotation.
[00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.800]   He eventually became a neurologist, then a researcher.
[00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:53.280]   And I used to say, what do you mean?
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:54.360]   The hand-washing does nothing.
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:55.680]   And he's like, well, have you ever seen
[00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:57.160]   what a physician does before surgery?
[00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:58.600]   You know, they wash up to their,
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.640]   up to their, basically their shoulders.
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:04.120]   They've got betadine, they glove in properly.
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.880]   And, you know, that's how you prevent infection.
[00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:07.080]   Washing your hands does nothing.
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:07.940]   It's a formality.
[00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:10.300]   And I thought, there's no way that could be true.
[00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:12.680]   Then I started digging around in the literature about this,
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:14.480]   and it's kind of mixed.
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:16.400]   Like, so, to what extent does washing our hands
[00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:18.520]   actually help us avoid getting infection?
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:19.800]   I, you know, it's a good question.
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:22.480]   And I think it probably comes down to some of the studies
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:25.120]   are probably not good data or heterogeneous enough
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.980]   to do a meta-analysis.
[00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:30.800]   But what's really interesting is how many times a day,
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:32.840]   if you were to watch yourself, that you touch your nose,
[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:33.680]   you touch your face.
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:36.160]   And these are the portals for viruses
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:37.440]   to come into your body. - Eyes.
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:39.280]   - Yeah, eyes, nose, mouth.
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:40.120]   That's where they come.
[00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:42.140]   And we touch them all the time.
[00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:44.320]   You touch handles.
[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:47.120]   I mean, if you think about it, it's almost,
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:49.200]   I don't know, creepy.
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.400]   - And flu, it is creepy.
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:54.440]   And flu and cold can survive out on surfaces for how long?
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.440]   - I'd have to look up the numbers,
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:58.640]   but it's longer than you might think.
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:00.440]   I know that when we looked at COVID,
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:03.000]   it's that really, I know we went crazy
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.760]   at the beginning of the COVID pandemic
[00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:05.960]   about wiping things down.
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:10.000]   And really, that's not the way it seems to spread for COVID
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.800]   and more airborne things, but for influenza droplets,
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:17.320]   that is, you know, rotavirus, C. diff,
[00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:20.800]   that's clostridium difficile infection of the bowel.
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:24.120]   That's the primary way that it actually spreads.
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:27.220]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:30.580]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:31.980]   (upbeat music)
