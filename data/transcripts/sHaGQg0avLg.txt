[00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.680]   What kind of questions can science not currently answer and may never be able to answer?
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:21.040]   Yeah, is there intelligence out there that's underlies the whole thing?
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.320]   You can call them with the G word if you want. I can say,
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:34.320]   are we a computer simulation with a purpose? Is there an agent, an intelligent agent,
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:41.440]   that underlies or is responsible for the whole thing? Does that intelligent agent satisfy the
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.160]   laws of physics? Does it satisfy the laws of quantum mechanics? Is it made of atoms and molecules?
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:52.560]   Yeah, there's a lot of questions. And I don't see... it seems to me a real question.
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.600]   It's an answerable question. Well, I don't know if it's answerable. The questions have to be
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:05.520]   answerable to be real. Some philosophers would say that a question is not a question unless it's
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:14.720]   answerable. This question doesn't seem to me answerable by any known method, but it seems to me
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.320]   real.
