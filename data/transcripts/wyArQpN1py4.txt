[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.560]   Pastor John, here's a good question that we get all the time and it's worth
[00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.280]   addressing frequently in this podcast. It comes from a listener named Jacqueline
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.520]   who writes, "Hello Pastor John, I have a follow-up question to episode number 897.
[00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:16.080]   I appreciated your answer to the question, 'Is love fake if it's motivated
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.260]   by a reward?' As a follow-up I want to ask this, is love fake if it's only motivated
[00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.480]   by duty? I'm thinking of relationships where the believer acts lovingly, as in
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.760]   Philippians 2.4 and in 1st Corinthians 13, but without the feeling of love, often
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.360]   due to ongoing sin in the life of the beloved. Is it enough to love because I
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.960]   am supposed to if I know in my heart it is not tied to the desire to know and
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.880]   glorify Christ as you mentioned? Does the motivation for reward fuel love in that
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:53.480]   episode?" Well let me start with an illustration. I read this years ago in
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:01:00.280]   Edward John Carnell's book, oh the name just slips my mind, Christian Commitment.
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:09.200]   That's the name of it. He says, "Suppose a man asks, 'Must I kiss my wife goodnight?'"
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:18.080]   Carnell gives the answer, "Yes, but not that kind of must." That's very profound.
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.160]   It really affected my Christian Edenism. What did he mean? What did he mean? He
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:30.520]   meant that the man who asked this question misunderstands the nature of
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:41.000]   duty. He thinks that duty only relates to the external behavior of kissing, and if
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.560]   he kisses his wife he's done his duty. But Carnell's point is that Christian
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.600]   duty is deeper than physical acts, always deeper than physical acts. Our duty
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:01.840]   includes not only the external physical acts that are appropriate, virtuous, but
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:08.960]   also a right heart or a right disposition or right set of affections,
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:17.920]   emotions. So yes, it is a man's duty to kiss his wife, but that includes the duty
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:26.680]   of feeling affection for his wife. Now I think Jacqueline might be making the
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.880]   same mistake as the husband in that illustration. Maybe. I might
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:38.080]   misunderstand her, but let's see if this helps. She asks, "Is love fake if
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:46.720]   it's motivated by duty? Is it enough to love because I'm supposed to?" That
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:55.160]   sounds like she conceives of love as a set of external behaviors which one can
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:04.000]   will even if one does not feel any gladness in the act of love. But is
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:12.280]   that the biblical duty of love? Does not love, biblically speaking, include more
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.880]   than mere physical behavior? Always include more than mere physical behavior.
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:28.320]   So I want to argue that our duty is more than deeds, always more than deeds. The
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:36.800]   duty to give, for example, includes the duty to rejoice in giving. So giving or
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:46.000]   loving out of duty when there is no delight in giving is really only doing
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:53.800]   half our duty. God's will, as revealed in the New Testament, is that our loving
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:04:04.640]   behavior, deeds, should always include gladness in God that overflows in the
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.880]   hope of including other people in it. I'm gonna say that again because that is an
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:18.320]   absolutely crucial ethical sentence for me. The biblical duty to love, that is the
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:27.200]   very meaning of love, always includes gladness in God that overflows in the
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:37.480]   act, the behaviors of love, in the hope of including others in it. That is, in our
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:46.400]   gladness in God. I get that definition of love from 2nd Corinthians 8 verse 2
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:54.960]   and 9 verse 7. Here's what it says, "In a severe test of affliction there," that is
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:03.440]   the Macedonians, "abundance of joy and their extreme poverty overflowed in a
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:12.080]   wealth of generosity," giving, loving, "on their part." Notice carefully, the subject
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:23.280]   of the verb "overflowed" is joy. "Their abundance of joy overflowed in generosity."
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:30.720]   In other words, love was the overflow of joy in God—you can go back to verse 1 to
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:36.800]   see that—joy in God, in God's grace being poured out on them, that aimed to bless
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:43.920]   others and thus include others in that joy. That's what love does always. And
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:50.440]   notice also there were two huge obstacles standing in the way of this
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:57.960]   generosity—a severe test of affliction and extreme poverty. In other words, it was
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:06.000]   very costly—you might even say painful—for Christians to show generosity
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.680]   when they themselves were hurting and poverty-stricken. If there ever was a
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:18.280]   time when a person might say, "Surely all that is expected of us here is dutiful
[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:25.920]   deeds, not heartfelt joy," this was that time. But in fact, what
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:32.960]   marked these deeds of generosity as love was the abundance of joy in God that was
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:41.280]   overflowing in love in the hopes that others would be included in that joy. Now
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:46.560]   we know we're on the right track here because in chapter 9 verse 7 of 2nd
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:51.520]   Corinthians, just a chapter later, Paul makes it a principle. He takes this
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:58.880]   behavior and he makes it a principle. He says, "Each one must give as he has
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:04.640]   decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion." That's another way of
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:15.240]   saying mere willpower duty. "For God loves a cheerful giver." Now that's the clearest
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:23.040]   statement—that doing good things for people generously without any delight in
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:32.960]   the doing is only half our duty. So let me restate Jacqueline's question the way
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:37.080]   I would ask it because there's a real problem. There's a real problem she sees.
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:41.720]   She's right. She's right to see the problem and I'm just complaining about
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:46.040]   the way it was asked. And I hope something really important is being seen.
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:51.640]   Here's the way I would ask the question for John Piper. What does a Christian do
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:57.680]   when he is confronted with the opportunity of a helpful good deed that
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:07.000]   he doesn't feel like doing? That's the issue. Because that's real life. Perfect
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:14.400]   love to God will always delight perfectly in doing God's will. But until
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:21.280]   we reach perfection, which none of us does in this life, we are an embattled
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:31.040]   people. Satan and sin corrupt our will so that we feel disinclinations to do the
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:37.480]   loving thing. And that's reality. And this is why Jesus said, "Whoever would come
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:47.360]   after me must deny himself." In this fallen world where sin and Satan disincline us
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:55.800]   to love, self-denial will always be a part of the duty of love. So how does
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:09:03.080]   this work in the moment when there is an opportunity to do good and we
[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:09.160]   don't feel like doing good? And here's the difference between... I'm going to give
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:13.520]   you two options to do here. And people line up on these two options. I mean most
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:18.480]   line up on the first one, I'm afraid. The difference between a Christian
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:24.360]   hedonist, my understanding of our duty at that moment when we don't feel like
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:29.480]   doing the good we ought to do, and those who think emotions don't count.
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:34.880]   They're marginal. They're not essential at that moment. That group
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:41.080]   says, "Just do it. Just do it. Do the right thing because it's the right thing." All
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:46.720]   the while ignoring the biblical teaching that doing it cheerfully is part of the
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:52.600]   right thing at that moment. You can't just say, "Do it" as though it were your whole
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:59.440]   duty. It's not. It's half your duty. But the Christian hedonist, therefore, does
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:05.160]   four crucial things at this moment. Because I'm admitting John Piper, the
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:12.840]   imperfect, fallen, selfish Christian hedonist doesn't always want love, delight
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:16.480]   to do what he ought to do. So here's here are the four things we ought to do.
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:22.320]   Number one, admit honestly to God and to yourself you don't feel like doing the
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:30.020]   good thing. Admit it. Number two, confess this to God as sin and tell him that
[00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:38.280]   you're sorry for your heart not being more loving. Three, ask God in that
[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:45.280]   moment to restore the joy, the fullest joy of your salvation and an overflowing
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:52.240]   gladness in grace that can be shared with other people. Ask him to restore
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:11:01.840]   your joy. And four, now go ahead and act. Do that good behavior. Do that half of
[00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:10.000]   your duty. Do the good deed, hoping, expecting, believing. You've asked, you've
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   prayed that in it, in it, joy will be awakened and you will actually, before
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:24.440]   you're done, be delighting in the love before you're even finished. The loving
[00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:30.560]   behavior, now you're glad you're doing it. I, Tony, I have seen this happen in my
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:37.980]   life as a pastor over the years again and again and again. I would be, I would
[00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:43.040]   be on my way to the hospital when I didn't feel like it. And some saint is in
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:50.560]   trouble and I repent to God. God, I wish, I wish I had more compassion. I wish I
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:56.160]   felt more affection. I wish you were more fully in charge of my heart right now.
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:03.360]   Please restore to me the joy of loving my people. And how many times have I
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:08.200]   walked into that room and either before I get to the bed or as I put my hand on
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:16.760]   some dear saint's arm, God awakens gladness in being there. Gladness in
[00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:21.600]   being able to share the word. Gladness in being an instrument of their hope. Gladness
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:25.960]   in hoping that some of my gladness in the Lord would sustain them in their
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:32.360]   trial. So my answer to Jacqueline's question is that the duty of love always
[00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:38.160]   includes more than willpower behavior. It includes the gladness in God that
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:43.560]   overflows in the hope of including others in it. When the behavior and the
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:48.280]   gladness are both there, the duty is being performed. And when the gladness
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:56.360]   is not there and we confess it and repent and pray for forgiveness and act
[00:12:56.360 --> 00:13:02.440]   in hope that God will restore it, that too is our duty. Yeah, so helpful and
[00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:05.800]   carefully nuanced. Thank you, Pastor John. Well, we're gonna break for the weekend
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:08.560]   and return on Monday to hear from a listener who wants to know, "What are we
[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:11.560]   supposed to do with the verses in the Bible to talk about God regretting
[00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:17.080]   things and repenting of things?" Oh, such a great question, and that is next. If you
[00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:21.160]   missed any episodes from the week, catch up this weekend at our online home at
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:25.580]   DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn. I'm your host, Tony Reiki. We'll see you on
[00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:27.840]   Monday.
