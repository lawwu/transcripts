[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.720]   Welcome to Tech News Briefing.
[00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.680]   It's Wednesday, December 20th.
[00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.780]   I'm Alex Osella for The Wall Street Journal.
[00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.600]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.000]   Tech giants like Google and Apple run app stores that, some challengers say,
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.160]   operate as monopolies that stifle competition.
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.560]   One of those challengers is Tim Sweeney, the founder and CEO of Epic Games,
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.520]   the company behind the popular video game Fortnite.
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.840]   Last week, Epic defeated Google in court.
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.880]   The video game company alleged that Google used its dominant position to squeeze
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.460]   excess profits from app developers.
[00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.320]   In a separate lawsuit settled this week, Google agreed to pay $700 million and
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.360]   make certain changes to its app store after a coalition of states claimed its
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.000]   app store functioned as an illegal monopoly.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.880]   What does all of this mean for Epic and for the video game industry as a whole?
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.240]   WSJ tech reporter Sarah Needleman is here to tell us.
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.560]   Sarah, what made Fortnite different from other games when it was first
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.240]   released in 2017?
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.160]   >> It was a totally new property for
[00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.320]   an industry that's dominated by well-known franchises like Call of Duty.
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.600]   And it came out free.
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.360]   Most of the games that you would have at this high level of quality for
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.360]   consoles were not free at the time, so that was different.
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.600]   And the Battle Royale style of gameplay was still relatively new at that time.
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.740]   And notably, Epic released Fortnite on every platform it possibly could.
[00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.400]   And then it really lobbied to enable game cross play between those platforms.
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.520]   So the different companies that make consoles like Microsoft and Sony and
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.160]   Nintendo, as well as at the time the app stores like Apple, Google,
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.400]   they all had to sort of work together in a way to make it possible for cross play.
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.280]   And that's something that was championed by Tim Sweeney, the founder and
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.760]   CEO of Epic, and that was the first and we've seen other games do it since then.
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.680]   >> How has Fortnite's popularity changed over the years?
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.240]   >> It was wildly popular when the Battle Royale version came out in 2018.
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.840]   Within a year, it had more than 250 million registered players.
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.920]   At one point in 2020, 15.3 million people were playing simultaneously.
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.000]   It has fallen out of favor to some extent, not a total drop off, but
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.480]   we've seen a bit of a decline in people watching it on Twitch.
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.900]   And just there's so many chapters, so many seasons,
[00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.200]   people got a little bit tired of it, there were competitors that put out similar games.
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.920]   And then it was booted from the app stores,
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.080]   which is a big part of what's led to the conversation around the game today.
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.400]   But we did see the game made a really big comeback in November.
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.300]   And we'll see if it sticks.
[00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.520]   >> Sarah, you mentioned that Fortnite was booted from app stores.
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.000]   What happened and what was Epic's response?
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.240]   >> What happened is both Apple and Google kicked Fortnite off their app stores
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:59.520]   because Epic inserted its own payment systems into Fortnite for their platforms.
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.360]   And that went against their rules, subsequently Epic sued them.
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.800]   And Epic had somewhat of a victory last week when a judge ruled in Epic's favor
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.720]   against Google, and so that was a big win.
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.160]   Epic hasn't been as fortunate with its legal battle against Apple.
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.160]   But that case is not totally over either.
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.240]   Apple and Epic both approached the Supreme Court requesting
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.480]   the court take a look at the case, and so we may see that live on as well.
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.840]   >> So as of today, could you find Fortnite on the Google Play Store,
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.360]   as a result of the conclusion of this lawsuit?
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.240]   >> No, not yet, Google is appealing.
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:44.200]   And in order for that to happen, we'll have to see how exactly the judge rules
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.960]   in terms of compliance, because Epic isn't asking for a payout.
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.560]   It's looking for changes in the way the app store operates.
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.760]   But there was a new development, a judge ruled against Google.
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.040]   And in that case, Alphabet agreed to pay $700 million to make changes to the app
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.960]   store, and we'll see some of those changes will align with what Epic has been seeking.
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.960]   >> The new development that you're referring to relates to Google settlement
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:09.320]   this week that resolves claims by a group of states that Google operated its app store
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.280]   as an illegal monopoly.
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.640]   This is not the same suit brought by Epic.
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.960]   But what does this settlement mean for Epic?
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.480]   >> We don't know exactly yet, but the settlement forces Google to make some
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.440]   of the changes that Epic was also asking for.
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.680]   Those changes were developers will now be allowed to use an alternative billing
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.760]   system to Google Play's billing option.
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.840]   And the settlement requires that Alphabet simplify the process of downloading apps
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.640]   directly from developers' websites without using an online store such as Google Play.
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.480]   >> Let's circle back to Epic founder and CEO Tim Sweeney.
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.840]   What's the significance of his campaign to challenge these tech giants, Google and
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:47.360]   Apple?
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.800]   What does this mean for the video game industry?
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.480]   >> It's a little bit of a David versus Goliath kind of story.
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:57.240]   Even though Epic is a relatively large company, it's still a fraction the size of
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.440]   Google, and it's also a lot smaller than other video game companies that make big
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.000]   blockbuster type games.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.200]   And so what we're seeing here is a guy who started out as a programmer himself and
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.240]   still is.
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:14.680]   He's been a true hardcore gamer probably since his youth and has really fought for
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:15.440]   the small guy.
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.400]   And at least that's the narrative he has definitely made clear.
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.000]   >> That was our reporter Sarah Needleman.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   And that's it for Tech News Briefing.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.280]   Today's show was produced by Julie Chang with supervising producer
[00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.640]   Catherine Milsop.
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.680]   I'm Alex Osella for the Wall Street Journal.
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:30.520]   Thanks for listening.
