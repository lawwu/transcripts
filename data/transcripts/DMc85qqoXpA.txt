[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.920]   Pastor John, in Episode 912 of this podcast, it was titled "Paying Pastors, Church Buildings,
[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:13.320]   and Weekly Sermons," a trio of issues, you skipped right over the question about house
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.380]   churches and meeting in buildings, and many savvy listeners wrote in to point that out
[00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.380]   to us.
[00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.360]   Nothing gets past our listeners.
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.540]   So do you have any particular views when it comes to whether or not the church should
[00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.560]   meet in house churches or in buildings?
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.360]   Okay, not a problem.
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.840]   I have views.
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.800]   I think the Bible has something to say.
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.280]   I'll summarize my view in six observations.
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.880]   I don't think they're very controversial.
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.480]   I think they're easily supportable.
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.040]   So here we go, and people can judge for themselves.
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.360]   First, the church in the New Testament, as the New Testament teaches about the church,
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.480]   is people, not places.
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.280]   The word "church" in the New Testament is a translation of the word "ekklesia," which
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.900]   means "called out ones" or "assembly."
[00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.680]   It never refers to building or place.
[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.840]   The English word "church," it's an interesting word.
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:08.840]   Like, where'd that come from?
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:15.520]   Well, it came from the Old English "kirk" or "kirk," like in the Scottish "kirk," and
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.680]   it comes from the Greek "kuriakos," which means "belong to the Lord."
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.640]   So the word "church" means "belonging to the Lord" in its etymological origin, and could
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.480]   refer to a place or could refer to a people.
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.480]   So that's where the English word "church" comes from and doesn't prove anything about
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.920]   where a people should meet.
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:43.640]   But in this whole discussion, it is utterly crucial to keep in mind that in the New Testament,
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:50.800]   nothing is said about the church as place, and much is said about the church as people.
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:57.080]   And just to give a few examples, Matthew 16, 18, Jesus says to Peter, "On this rock I will
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.880]   build my church, and the gates of hell will not prevail against it."
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.140]   That was not a building he's talking about.
[00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:08.720]   Or in Matthew 18, 17, in church discipline, he says, "When all private entreaties fail,
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:09.720]   tell it to the church."
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.300]   That doesn't mean talk to brick.
[00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:19.680]   And in Acts 9, 31, it says, "So the church throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.760]   had peace and was being built up."
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:29.720]   And in Acts 13, 1, it says, "Now there were in the church in Antioch prophets and teachers,"
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.760]   meaning among the people that were—those were some of the gifted folks.
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.560]   So that's my first observation.
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:42.660]   The church in the New Testament is always, without exception, people, not places.
[00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:53.060]   Second observation is that the New Testament portrays local churches, that is, local assemblies,
[00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:59.680]   gatherings of the universal church in a local place, the expression of the universal church
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.880]   gathered in a local place.
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.980]   It portrays these churches often as gathering in homes.
[00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:15.540]   So 1 Corinthians 16, 19, "The churches of Asia send you greeting, Aquila and Priscilla,
[00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:21.620]   together with the church in their house, send you hearty greetings."
[00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:28.780]   Colossians 4, 15, "Give my greetings to the brothers at Laodicea and to Nympha and the
[00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.960]   church in her house."
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:40.240]   Philemon 2, "I write to Aphia and our sister and Archippus, our fellow soldier, and the
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.240]   church in your house."
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:51.640]   So it's clear that in the earliest days of the church, the church regularly met in homes.
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:58.560]   Third observation, don't overstate that or idolize that fact.
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:07.480]   I mean, idealize that fact, because we know from 1 Corinthians that houses were not the
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.120]   only venue for church gatherings.
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:16.680]   Paul says in chapter 11, verse 17 and 22, he says, "In the following instructions, I
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:24.280]   do not commend you, because when you come together, it is not for better but for worse."
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.280]   What?
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.480]   He says, "Do you not have houses to eat and drink in, or do you despise the church
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.680]   of God and humiliate those who have nothing?"
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:39.120]   In other words, he's saying you're getting together someplace other than your houses,
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.920]   and you're eating in a way that shames those who don't have a lot to eat, and you brought
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.120]   a big basket and you're eating it.
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.980]   Eat in your homes, not where we're gathering as church.
[00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:59.760]   So it seems to me pretty clear that people were leaving their homes, going to some commonplace
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:05.760]   of assembly for gathering of the church service, whatever it was.
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:13.980]   Fourth observation, nowhere in the New Testament is it commanded or forbidden that local churches
[00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:14.980]   meet in homes.
[00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:22.600]   It is perfectly acceptable that they do and acceptable that they don't.
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:29.140]   This is not something God thought it wise to regulate, no doubt, I think, in part because
[00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:35.120]   of the incredibly diverse cultural situations the church would find itself in for the next
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:45.160]   2,000 years, under trees, in garages, in stores, in cellars, in caves, in cathedrals, in homes.
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:52.680]   Fifth observation, therefore, in all of those differing cultural situations, leaders of
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:06:00.660]   the church should seriously think through and pray through the relative advantages and
[00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:08.660]   disadvantages of place and location, given the nature and goals of the church, whether
[00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:16.340]   they should limit their gatherings to homes or rent a space or purchase a space or build
[00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:17.820]   a space.
[00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:25.340]   And we should be really slow to judge the decisions that are made here, since God, it
[00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:33.540]   seems to me, has been pleased to bring great awakenings and massive church growth during
[00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:37.980]   times with and without church buildings.
[00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:46.220]   He's not limited in that way, and woe to the denomination or movement that presumes to
[00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:53.380]   say architecture, buildings, location is the key to the dynamic of the almighty spread
[00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:55.580]   of God's kingdom.
[00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:02.700]   And the final observation is that whatever the limitations are culturally—I mean, it's
[00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:10.140]   pretty hard to get a space in downtown San Francisco, Vancouver, Manhattan, because you're
[00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:13.740]   going to pay a million dollars for a tiny little place.
[00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:18.800]   And of course, I just read this morning as I was praying through Operation World that
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:24.660]   in Libya there's a law that forbids any religious gathering over six people.
[00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:31.220]   Well, that's pretty limiting, and you don't have to obey that law since it's not biblical,
[00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:36.660]   but you might want to obey it and spread the gospel that way.
[00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:44.180]   So whatever the limitations are culturally, financially, legally, it's a wonderful and
[00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:52.900]   fitting and helpful thing when local churches can find both small expressions of fellowship
[00:07:52.900 --> 00:08:00.660]   and mutual ministry, one another ministry, and larger gatherings for worship and encouragement
[00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:01.660]   and witness.
[00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:09.780]   And I think it's significant that Acts 5.42 says, "Every day in the temple and from house
[00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:15.740]   to house they did not cease teaching and preaching that Jesus is the Christ," which seems to
[00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:22.580]   imply that there was an early sense of need that there be both larger and smaller gatherings.
[00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:23.580]   That's so good.
[00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:26.720]   Thank you, Pastor John, for addressing house churches for us today.
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:27.720]   On Monday, we return.
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:32.460]   I'll ask John Piper, "What does it mean to pray without ceasing?"
[00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:37.300]   Until then, to search through our 940 or so episodes or for more details about this podcast

[00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:52.420]   Have a great weekend meeting together with the gathered Church of God, whether that happens
[00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:55.420]   to be in a house or in a building.
[00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:56.220]   We'll see you on Monday.
