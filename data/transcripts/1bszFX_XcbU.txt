[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680]   Now let's talk about how the best students
[00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:05.840]   structure their days.
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.820]   Turns out there are great studies on this.
[00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.580]   There's a really nice paper.
[00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:16.200]   In fact, that surveyed close to 700 students.
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.800]   These were medical students,
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.180]   approximately equal number of male and female students
[00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.800]   and analyze the most useful learning habits.
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.880]   That is the learning habits associated
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.520]   with the most successful students.
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.400]   Now, anytime you do a study like this
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.820]   where people take surveys,
[00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.440]   there's always the issue of causality.
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.160]   In fact, we can pretty much set aside
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.480]   any possible causality.
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.720]   For instance, I'm about to tell you
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.380]   that the very best performing students
[00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.280]   tend to study for about three or four hours per day.
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.920]   But you could easily say, well, they're the best students
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.760]   because they study three or four hours per day.
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.600]   They don't study three or four hours per day
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.600]   because they're the best students.
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.520]   And you'd be exactly right, okay?
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.200]   We can get into all sorts of discussions
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.120]   about correlation versus causation,
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.920]   about reverse causality and on and on.
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.780]   However, none of that is the point here.
[00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.040]   The point here is to establish what are the habits
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.960]   that the most successful students
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.040]   seem to incorporate over and over again,
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.680]   regardless of what classes they're taking,
[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.560]   regardless of where they are
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.800]   in their arc of their learning trajectory.
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.840]   And so what we know based on this study,
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.520]   and I'll provide a link to it in the show note captions,
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.320]   is that there are at least 10 study habits
[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.920]   that the highly effective students use.
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.620]   I'm going to focus on the top five or six
[00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.080]   just for sake of time,
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.960]   because it turns out that most of the effect,
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.200]   it appears, of being a better student
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.560]   can be attributed to these top five or six habits.
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.160]   First of all, they set aside time to study.
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.140]   They literally schedule time to study.
[00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.120]   Now this probably serves several roles.
[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.320]   The first one is that they are able
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.060]   to clear out other distractions.
[00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.640]   And in fact, that's the second thing that they do.
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.160]   They are very effective,
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.640]   or they make it a point of putting their phone away and off,
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.040]   of isolating themselves.
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.240]   That's right, they're not studying with other people.
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.720]   They study alone,
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.800]   which is not to say that people who study with others
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.940]   cannot be effective in their studying,
[00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.360]   but the best performing students seem to study alone.
[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.860]   They put their phone away.
[00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.720]   They tell their friends and families
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.920]   that they are not going to be able to be reached
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.240]   during that time.
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.920]   And yes, they study for three or four hours per day,
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.360]   but they break that up
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.480]   into a couple of different sessions typically,
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.560]   two or three sessions.
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.320]   So they're not doing a three or four hour studying
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.700]   about all in one shot.
[00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.280]   So they're managing their time,
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.000]   they're eliminating distractions,
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.300]   and they're studying for a consistent amount of time,
[00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.200]   at least five days per week, okay?
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.980]   Presumably they're taking some weekends off,
[00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.180]   although that wasn't made clear from this paper.
[00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.160]   The other thing that they do, and this is very important,
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.200]   is that they make an effort to then teach their peers,
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.240]   to teach other students in the class.
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.800]   Now, some of you may be thinking,
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.520]   and I'm thinking back to college here mostly,
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.720]   that if you spend all this time learning the information
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.460]   and you are in a competitive scenario
[00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:59.560]   with the other students,
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.120]   that teaching them the information
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.780]   is kind of a freebie for them and it's harder for you,
[00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:04.720]   meaning you're putting yourself
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.460]   at a competitive disadvantage,
[00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.720]   or you're giving them an unfair advantage
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.320]   for not having done the work.
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.040]   Now, while this paper didn't do an analysis
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.000]   of whether or not these students that served as the learners
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.640]   from the other students got an unfair advantage,
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.200]   it's very clear that students who make it a point
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.960]   to learn material in isolation,
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.820]   then bring that material to other students
[00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.840]   in the same course and teach them,
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.260]   perform exceedingly well in comparison to the other students.
[00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.320]   So don't be afraid to be a teacher of your peers
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.340]   in order to test, this is key,
[00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.480]   to test and develop mastery of the material.
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.140]   Now, in my laboratory for years, we used to have a saying,
[00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.480]   which I simply picked up from the laboratories
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.080]   I was trained in, I didn't come up with the saying,
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.280]   which was watch one, do one, teach one.
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.440]   And that was referring to doing surgeries or suturing,
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.480]   or doing an antibody reaction, or a Western blot,
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.380]   or things that you do in laboratories.
[00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.840]   Watch one, do one, teach one.
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.360]   Watch one, do one, teach one, of course,
[00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:03.520]   should be reserved to anything
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.380]   where no one's going to be put in danger
[00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.840]   by the watch one, do one, teach one procedure, right?
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.200]   Some procedures, especially in laboratories,
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.400]   can be dangerous given the materials you use, et cetera.
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.960]   And of course, today we're talking about learning
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:15.960]   and studying generally.
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.920]   So provided it's safe, watch one, do one, teach one,
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.260]   is an excellent means to learn,
[00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.920]   that is to study new material,
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.780]   to develop proficiency and even mastery.
[00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.080]   And over time, perhaps even virtuosity.
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.420]   We'll return to that later, those distinctions.
[00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.840]   So going back to this idea
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.640]   that the best students set aside time,
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:40.280]   they designate time to study alone, without distractions,
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.400]   that is sure to help them anchor their focus and attention.
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.800]   They know that they're going to need
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.160]   to use their focus and attention during that time.
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.000]   And we know with absolute certainty
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.280]   that focus and attention are a limited
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.840]   but renewable resource in the human brain.
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:56.760]   The longer you're awake,
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.840]   the more is the buildup of a molecule
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.600]   called adenosine in your brain and body.
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.080]   It makes you sleepy, makes it harder to focus.
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.680]   When you sleep, adenosine levels are pushed down again.
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.000]   You're able to focus again, you feel more alert.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.960]   You can think of adenosine
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.960]   as limiting your attentional budget,
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.940]   which is not to say that some people don't study best
[00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.080]   in the afternoon or in the evening
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.460]   or even late at night, right?
[00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.840]   I recall times during university when I'd study
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.120]   between the hours of 10 p.m. and 2 a.m.
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.200]   I don't do that any longer,
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.800]   but scheduling time where you know
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.520]   you're going to need to be focused and attending
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.440]   is perhaps one of the most important things
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.340]   toward being able to focus and attend to the material.
[00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.120]   Now, if you're taking courses,
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.080]   you probably are going to be a slave
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.160]   to the timing of the courses.
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.920]   You aren't going to be able to tell the instructor,
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.940]   "Okay, listen, I want you to do this course at 3 p.m.
[00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.300]   because that's when you learn best or at 8 a.m.
[00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.700]   because that's when you happen to be able to attend best."
[00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.020]   However, to the extent that you have any control
[00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:52.620]   over the time in which you're going to study,
[00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.220]   keeping that at a regular time or times,
[00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:56.680]   perhaps one block early in the day,
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.220]   one block later in the day,
[00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.780]   perhaps two blocks early in the day and so on,
[00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:01.820]   is going to be beneficial.
[00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.460]   It turns out that's also supported
[00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:04.860]   by the research literature,
[00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:09.740]   that the brain, just like with its sleep-wake cycles,
[00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.080]   that entrain to a regular schedule,
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.880]   that is your brain and body get used to being active
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.560]   and inactive at particular times
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.040]   based on your exposure to sunlight,
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.200]   your exposure to activities, your social rhythms, et cetera.
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.200]   If you regularly, meaning for the course of about three days
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:29.160]   make it a point to focus and study at particular times,
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.580]   again, pulling your attention back,
[00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:31.760]   it's not an automatic process,
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.980]   but pulling your attention back to a specific location,
[00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:38.240]   perhaps on a page or that you're listening to in a lecture,
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:42.580]   your body and brain will start to entrain to that rhythm
[00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:45.900]   such that you will be able to focus and attend better
[00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:49.260]   simply by virtue of the regularity of the timing
[00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.100]   of the exposure to the material, okay?
[00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:53.620]   So you probably need about two or three days
[00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:55.580]   to break into a regular schedule
[00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.940]   of focusing and attending and studying at a given time
[00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:02.060]   or times, allow yourself that transition period,
[00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:06.060]   but then make it a point to schedule those times to study,
[00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:09.740]   set aside your phone, tell people you're going offline,
[00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:12.340]   turn off the wifi if you need to or have to,
[00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:14.300]   you may need it for your studying, I don't know,
[00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:15.620]   depends on what you're studying,
[00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:17.940]   but limit distractions at all costs
[00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:20.700]   and learn to just focus on the material.
[00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:22.020]   And this is a skill,
[00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:23.460]   this is the most important thing to understand.
[00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:26.100]   It's a skill to be able to focus and study.
[00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:28.660]   And it's a skill that you can learn very quickly,
[00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:31.100]   especially if you schedule it for regular times
[00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:33.420]   and you give yourself two or three days
[00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:35.620]   in which to adapt to those schedules and times
[00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:38.200]   and then try and stick to them as regularly as possible,
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.520]   perhaps even on the weekends,
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.460]   if you're approaching the end of the quarter or semester,
[00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:45.380]   perhaps even on the weekend,
[00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:47.900]   even if you're not in the quarter or semester,
[00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:50.920]   keeping those regular times will entrain your nervous system
[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:54.860]   to study and learn at its best at those particular times.
[00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:57.200]   There's one other point that I wanted to pass along
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.740]   from this really nice study on the study habits
[00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:01.700]   of highly effective medical students
[00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:03.700]   that I've been referring to.
[00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:06.380]   And that is when one examined,
[00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:07.780]   or these people were asked
[00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:10.780]   about their motivation for studying,
[00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:14.220]   the best performing students had an interesting answer.
[00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:18.340]   They had a very long-term understanding of how,
[00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:19.700]   or belief rather,
[00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:23.340]   about how their success in medical school
[00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:25.980]   would impact their family,
[00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:27.780]   how it would impact their life arc,
[00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:29.300]   how it would change them.
[00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:31.260]   And they weren't particular about the ways
[00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.100]   in which it would change them or their family.
[00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:35.560]   In fact, it was a rather broad, abstract,
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:39.640]   aspirational way of thinking about their study efforts.
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:43.220]   So what I like so much about this paper is that,
[00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:45.740]   in addition to having a fairly large sample size,
[00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:48.100]   close to 700 students that were evaluated,
[00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:52.620]   and yes, it's purely self-report and this kind of thing,
[00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:55.740]   nonetheless, it bridges the two extremes
[00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:57.260]   of studying and learning.
[00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:58.900]   It gets right down into the nitty gritty
[00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:00.940]   of how long they study, when they study,
[00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:02.860]   the things they do to limit distraction
[00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:04.660]   that we just discussed,
[00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:06.900]   but it also gets to their underlying
[00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:09.540]   psychological motivations and the thing that they use
[00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:12.640]   in order to pull them forward through their study efforts,
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:16.200]   perhaps, especially when their desire is waning
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.680]   or their level of fatigue is increasing.
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:20.480]   I don't know that, I'm speculating here,
[00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:23.400]   but this is this aspirational component
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:25.060]   of going to medical school,
[00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:26.340]   which it turns out in the country
[00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:28.140]   in which this study was done,
[00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:31.460]   only very, very select few of the very best students
[00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:33.300]   are able to achieve that.
[00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:34.460]   And they have to learn the information
[00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:37.960]   in a different language altogether, which is incredible.
[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:39.300]   I always marvel at that.
[00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:42.180]   I have friends that did their PhD thesis in Italy,
[00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:44.020]   they're Italian by birth,
[00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:47.020]   they now happen to run a laboratory in Italy,
[00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:49.980]   and they had to do their PhD training and write papers
[00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:54.060]   and give their thesis dissertation and defense in English,
[00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:56.100]   even though English was their second language.
[00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:57.300]   So talk about a challenge,
[00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:00.940]   and that's just one example that I can think of.
[00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:02.540]   There are many examples of that.
[00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:06.440]   These students that I'm referring to in this study
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:09.860]   are not necessarily constantly thinking about
[00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:12.420]   how their efforts will transform themselves
[00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:13.680]   and their families,
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:16.100]   but they certainly were able to report
[00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:18.420]   what it was specifically that they are seeking,
[00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:19.980]   what they're aspiring to,
[00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:22.620]   besides just trying to do as well as they can
[00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:24.700]   getting into and through medical school.
[00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:28.720]   So the high-level aspirational stuff within you,
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:29.900]   whatever that is for you,
[00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:32.220]   it's going to be highly individual,
[00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:33.700]   is certainly important,
[00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:37.280]   and it offers a bookend to the nuts and boltsy
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.020]   kind of stuff that you're going to do,
[00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:40.820]   I would hope, in order to best study
[00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:42.680]   and learn the specific material.
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:45.080]   So the specific actions that you're going to take each day
[00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:46.880]   to learn specific bits of information
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:50.140]   that will pull you toward those important aspirations.
[00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:53.520]   And now, again, if you love the material you're learning,
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.140]   this aspirational component
[00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:56.800]   is probably not as important, right?
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:59.920]   I can recall during university and graduate school
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:02.560]   and so on, thinking, oh my goodness,
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:03.960]   this is like the coolest thing I've ever heard.
[00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.140]   I've probably said that about a million different topics.
[00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:08.360]   Oh my goodness, circadian rhythms, seasonal rhythms,
[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.080]   melatonin, neural circuits, dopamine.
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:12.840]   I was just awash with excitement about what I was learning.
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:14.640]   But of course, sometimes I would take a course
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.260]   where the material was,
[00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:17.680]   I don't know if it was more challenging or not,
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:20.880]   but I had a harder time getting engaged by the material,
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:23.160]   either by virtue of how it was being taught to me
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:24.640]   or the material itself.
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:27.160]   So the ability to attach to some aspirational goal,
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:30.760]   to pull you through, can be very valuable.
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:33.620]   You're not going to love every topic you have to learn.
[00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:37.840]   However, I will say that, at least in my experience,
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:40.640]   some of the courses that I look back on most fondly
[00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:43.520]   are the courses that I struggled with the most.
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:46.200]   And in fact, that's the basis of the next
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:49.700]   and easily one of the most important studying tools.
[00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:53.800]   So a key theme in all of the excellent literature,
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:57.620]   that is the peer-reviewed research on how best to study,
[00:11:57.620 --> 00:11:59.900]   is that studying that feels challenging
[00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:01.620]   is the most effective.
[00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:03.380]   I know nobody wants to hear this.
[00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:05.620]   Everyone wants to hear about flow.
[00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:08.100]   Everybody wants to hear about information
[00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:10.220]   just sinking into their brain by osmosis.
[00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:11.700]   I think it was a Garfield cartoon
[00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:13.820]   where he talked about learning by osmosis.
[00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:15.740]   There's this very cute real-world video
[00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:17.980]   of a kid in a classroom.
[00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:20.900]   I believe it's in China where he's taking the book
[00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:21.820]   and he puts it on his head.
[00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:22.820]   Maybe I can find this clip.
[00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:24.900]   And he's just kind of like trying to wash it into his brain.
[00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:26.920]   It's super cute clip, but guess what?
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:27.900]   That doesn't work.
[00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:29.700]   I mean, it works to put the book on your head.
[00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:30.580]   It doesn't work.
[00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:33.740]   It's not going to get the information into your brain.
[00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:35.420]   Perhaps someday there will be ways
[00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:38.260]   to rapidly download information into neural circuits.
[00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.820]   Right now, we know, we've known for hundreds,
[00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:43.260]   if not thousands of years,
[00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:48.260]   that effort is the cornerstone of learning.
[00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.660]   So I know there are probably some groans about that.
[00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:52.140]   I know some of you perhaps were hoping
[00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:54.420]   that today I was going to tell you how to study
[00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:56.820]   so that studying wasn't painful.
[00:12:56.820 --> 00:13:00.760]   I think I can accomplish that by the end of today's episode.
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:03.780]   But in order to do that, let's take another quiz.
[00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:08.120]   Can you name or list off in your mind three tools
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:10.920]   that the most effective students have been shown to use?
[00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:16.220]   I can think of limiting distraction
[00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:17.700]   by virtue of putting away phones
[00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:21.300]   and telling others you won't be in contact with them too.
[00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:24.060]   And I'm getting these out of order, I realize,
[00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:26.380]   is to isolate, to study alone.
[00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:28.580]   And the third that I can recall
[00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:33.460]   is to teach others in the same course.
[00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:35.900]   Okay, you can probably think of a few others.
[00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:39.140]   Now, why are we taking these silly little quizzes?
[00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:42.300]   Well, it turns out they're not so silly
[00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:44.380]   when one considers that hopefully
[00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:47.540]   you'll remember the information from today
[00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:50.220]   so that you don't have to listen to it over and over again,
[00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:55.220]   but that if ever there was a strongly research-supported tool
[00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:57.580]   in the literature, in the peer-reviewed literature
[00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:00.440]   about how students can learn information better,
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:02.400]   it's testing.
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:05.180]   And I know, I know, I know we think of tests
[00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:08.500]   as a way to evaluate our knowledge,
[00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:10.980]   but it turns out that testing is one of the best ways
[00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:14.100]   to build our knowledge, to retain our knowledge,
[00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:16.580]   and again, to offset forgetting.
[00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:19.160]   [upbeat music]
[00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:21.740]   (upbeat music)
[00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:23.900]   (upbeat music)
