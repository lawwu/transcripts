[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - You've said that evil in society arises from institutions,
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.120]   not inherently from our nature.
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.360]   Do you think most human beings are good,
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.760]   they have good intent, or do most have the capacity
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.160]   for intentional evil that depends on their upbringing,
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.760]   depends on their environment, on context?
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.520]   - I wouldn't say that they don't arise from our nature.
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.600]   Anything we do arises from our nature.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.280]   And the fact that we have certain institutions,
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:35.280]   not others, is one mode in which human nature
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.280]   has expressed itself.
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.800]   But as far as we know, human nature could yield
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.800]   many different kinds of institutions.
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.720]   The particular ones that have developed
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.480]   have to do with historical contingency,
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.840]   the who conquered whom, and that sort of thing.
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.920]   They're not rooted in our nature in the sense
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.320]   that they're essential to our nature.
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.720]   So it's commonly argued that these days
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.480]   that something like market systems
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.120]   is just part of our nature.
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.200]   But we know from a huge amount of evidence
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.080]   that that's not true.
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.280]   There's all kinds of other structures.
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.800]   It's a particular fact about a moment of modern history.
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.320]   Others have argued that the roots of classical liberalism
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.000]   actually argue that what's called sometimes
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.760]   an instinct for freedom, an instinct to be free
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.720]   of domination by illegitimate authority
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.240]   is the core of our nature.
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.200]   That would be the opposite of this.
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.080]   And we don't know.
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.280]   We just know that human nature can accommodate both kinds.
