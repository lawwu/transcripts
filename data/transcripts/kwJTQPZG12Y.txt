[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.440]   A lot of people who would like to train more for strength, train more often for strength,
[00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:14.300]   do strength and endurance work, the challenge sometimes isn't just scheduling it, it's that
[00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.200]   we feel depleted and tired afterward.
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.480]   Have you observed this and is there a way to use strength training or other forms of
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.080]   training to improve cognitive function?
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.800]   Because I, you know, again, as you pointed out, only compromises, not solutions.
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.600]   But I do see a world in which one could use their physical training to give them a, for
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.920]   lack of a better word, a boost into the day.
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.520]   So you're getting stronger, you're developing your health, and you're also able to then
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.960]   lean into your day with more focus and intention.
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.480]   That would be the ultimate scenario.
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.480]   Okay.
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.480]   Yeah.
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.240]   Well, there's obviously, we're looking at a zero-sum game.
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.800]   So there's, you only have so much, you know, your resources are limited.
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.800]   One thing that will absolutely help is fragmentation.
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.600]   It's been proven that dividing up a given workload into smaller chunks allows you, doesn't
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.160]   matter what it is, whether it's endurance training or strength training or some cognitive
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.520]   work, you're able to, you're able to do more.
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.920]   And that's one thing that to consider.
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.260]   The other is, obviously, the feedback.
[00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.360]   You know, you have to listen to your body, pretty much.
[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.600]   Soviets stressed very much that you have to take the cybernetic approach.
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.600]   You have to have the feedback.
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.920]   No matter what the training plan says, Arkadii Vorobiev says, you have to listen to, you
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.320]   have to listen to that feedback.
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.320]   And freshness in the Soviet system of strength training, and not just in weightlifting, freshness
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.200]   was paramount.
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.200]   It's even better.
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.760]   Let's talk about how track athletes in the Soviet Union trained for strength.
[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.760]   And that's more, that will be even more applicable to a lot of the listeners, because they definitely
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.760]   didn't spend two and a half hours in the, you know, in the gym.
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:57.380]   So Professor Vladimir Dyachkov, he was a head coach, and he was one of the first to implement
[00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.200]   heavy lifting for the, for the track after, right after the Soviets decided, hey, look
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.120]   at these Americans, you know, lifting heavy weights, Bruce Randall and Paul Anderson and
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.960]   Canadian Doug Hebron.
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:14.100]   So these lifters, he has absolutely, he says, always do low reps.
[00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.720]   So they would never do more than three, four reps, even with the lightest weight, even
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.640]   with a warm-up weight.
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.860]   They spent a lot of time doing just singles and doubles, and it was absolutely essential
[00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.280]   that they stayed fresh.
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.240]   And part of it was just the, how they felt.
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.340]   Part of it is the performance, how well they jumped and so on, and how they felt after.
[00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.320]   So they found if you're really obsessive about it, you have that tonic effect that lasts
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.640]   at least until the next day.
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.680]   And the tonic effect is both for your strength, for your power, but also for, you know, your
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.600]   cognitive functions as well.
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:54.460]   But it's also very, very interesting that, here's an idea, do a bench press before the
[00:02:54.460 --> 00:03:00.120]   next day before you're competing in a jump, or do a heavy squat the day before you're
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.660]   competing as a thrower.
[00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.560]   So it's, again, it's very interesting how the opposite part of the body stimulating
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.560]   that was very, very helpful, very interesting phenomena.
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:16.340]   So they found if the strength work is familiar and non-exhaustive, it absolutely facilitates
[00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.920]   whatever is that you do afterwards.
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:25.520]   And restricting, this is where the difference, this is where track athletes were very different
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.520]   from a lot of other people.
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.000]   They tried to restrict their volume as much as possible of strength training, in part
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.860]   because, well, they had to do other things, and because they had to stay fresh.
[00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.740]   So if you look at the volume, if you look at, generally speaking, how many repetitions
[00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:49.140]   that you want to perform per exercise, per training session, and, again, these are purely
[00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.220]   empirical numbers.
[00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:55.100]   They come from Soviet weightlifting, but they were also applied in track.
[00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:01.460]   So the minimal volume is 10 to 20 repetitions total, so minimal.
[00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:08.660]   And optimal is 20 to 30, maximal, it becomes 30 to 50 in that window.
[00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:13.440]   So when you're looking at 20 to 30 reps, maybe on the lower end right there, you're going
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.620]   to build strength.
[00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:22.940]   And if you also are going to not go to failure and rest sufficiently between sets, unless
[00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.940]   you're greasing the groove, you need to look at at least five minutes, pretty much.
[00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.540]   And that's both for neural and biochemical reasons, but more is really better.
[00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:35.580]   Unfortunately, really, a lot of it just comes down to listening to your body and just using
[00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:36.580]   your judgment.
[00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.260]   I don't know if I had any better-- I wish I had any better answer here.
[00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:40.620]   I think it's a terrific answer.
[00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:46.980]   I like to leave the gym with some gas in the tank, because, well, I get paid to think and
[00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:50.340]   to speak, as it were, not to lift, but--
[00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:57.500]   And many great thinkers in the strength world, starting from Liedermann back 100 years ago
[00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:05.420]   to Soviet weightlifting authorities like, you know, Rodionov and Roman, and later on
[00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:11.740]   somebody like even Steve Justa was a very colorful individual, just brilliant, brilliant
[00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:18.160]   strength athlete, a farmer from Nebraska, who just came up with some fantastic protocols.
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.180]   But he would say that you've got to finish stronger than when you started.
[00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:29.100]   And that theme is very much permeates professional or high-level strength training, where this
[00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:34.780]   mentality of a workout or try to get smoked or pumped or throw up in the bucket, they
[00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.060]   would look at you as that's insane.
[00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:42.060]   One of the reasons that also Soviets restricted the number of reps in the squad, because you
[00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:45.420]   do sets of 10 in the squad, you're going to definitely put on some mass, no question about
[00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:46.540]   it.
[00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:51.140]   But one of the reasons they restricted that, very few people did sets of 10 except for
[00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:56.420]   heavyweights who had a hard time bulking, and even more, is like, okay, that's too much
[00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:59.140]   cardiorespiratory stress.
[00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:03.420]   And even though Soviet weightlifters did some general physical training like cross-country
[00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:08.540]   running or playing soccer, but they're not trying to get their cardio on the lifting
[00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:09.540]   platform.
[00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:11.340]   That has just made no sense whatsoever.
[00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:16.860]   So restricting the reps will go a very long way, increasing the rest periods to at least
[00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:21.500]   five minutes would go a very long way, and restricting the number of exercises.
[00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.500]   Because people don't realize that you're using different muscle groups, but still using the
[00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:25.500]   same brain.
[00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.860]   You're still using the same adrenals.
[00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.060]   And all that stuff really adds up.
[00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:36.380]   So I would say two, during one practice, one training practice, maybe two, maybe three
[00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.460]   exercises max lifts.
[00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.500]   And nothing wrong with doing just one.
[00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:45.600]   And yeah, if you want to, you know, do your curls and whatever calves later, that's fine.
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.980]   But you can tack it on in the end, or you can do it totally separate.
[00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:51.020]   Those things don't really zap you.
[00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:54.500]   You can just come in on a separate day and just do your, enjoy your calf burn.
[00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:55.500]   Love it.
[00:06:55.500 --> 00:07:03.380]   Thanks for watching.
