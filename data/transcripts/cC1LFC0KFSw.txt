[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480]   I was on the run for four months, stole $600,000.
[00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.160]   I was in Las Vegas, Nevada.
[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.320]   One day, I had stolen, the night before,
[00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.520]   I had stolen 160K out of ATMs.
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.760]   Went in the next morning, I woke up,
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.680]   signed on to cartersmarket.com,
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.920]   which was ran by Max Butler, the Iceman,
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.160]   and there's my name, US Most Wanted, on it.
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.120]   And that gets your attention.
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.480]   That was my real name with the US Most Wanted beside of it.
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.160]   Nobody knew my real name in that environment at all,
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.280]   but then they did.
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.840]   And it was talking about me being part of the Secret Service,
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.480]   Operation Anglerfish, everything else.
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.440]   So of course, they're all like--
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.400]   - So everybody's after you.
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.760]   - Oh yeah, we're gonna get this son of a bitch.
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.200]   - The following is a conversation with Brett Johnson,
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.840]   a former cyber criminal
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.400]   who built the first organized cyber crime community
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.200]   called Shadow Crew that is the precursor
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.200]   to today's darknet and darknet markets.
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.960]   He's referred to by the United States Secret Service
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.040]   as quote, "The original internet godfather."
[00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.120]   He has been the central figure in the cyber crime world
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.640]   for almost 20 years,
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.280]   placed on the US Most Wanted list in 2006
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.080]   before being convicted of 39 felonies for cyber crime,
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.400]   escaped from prison,
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.680]   and then eventually being locked up,
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:18.960]   served his time,
[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.960]   and now is helping people understand and fight cyber crime.
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.320]   This was a raw, honest, emotional, and real episode.
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.880]   Brett has caused a lot of pain to a lot of people,
[00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.960]   and yet his own story is full of trauma and pain,
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.520]   and also redemption and love.
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.400]   This is a good time to say that I have,
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.760]   and I will talk to people who have served time in prison,
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.480]   and perhaps people who currently are in prison.
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.080]   I will try to do my best to both empathize
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.680]   with the person across from me,
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.280]   and not let them sugarcoat, explain away,
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.440]   or dismiss the crimes they committed.
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.920]   This is a tough line to walk,
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.640]   because if you close your heart to the other person,
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.000]   you'll never fully understand their mind and their story.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.720]   But if you open the heart too much,
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.240]   you can be manipulated
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.520]   to where the conversation reveals nothing honest or real.
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.520]   This requires skill and willingness to take the risk.
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.360]   I don't know about the skill part,
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.120]   but I'd like to take the risk.
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.160]   I always wear my heart on my sleeve.
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.800]   If I get hurt for it, that's life.
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.600]   As I've said, I want to understand
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.600]   what makes a person do these crimes,
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.640]   the particular characteristics of their temporary
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.560]   or permanent madness, their justifications,
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.520]   but also their humanity.
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.520]   I believe each of us have the capacity
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.320]   to become both the criminal and the victim,
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.760]   the predator and the prey.
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.200]   It's up to us to avoid these paths
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.520]   or to find the path to redemption.
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.320]   It's on each of us.
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.360]   It's our responsibility and burden
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.180]   of being human in a complicated and dangerous world.
[00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.160]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.200]   To support it, please check out our sponsors
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.320]   in the description.
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.200]   And now, dear friends, here's Brett Johnson.
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.160]   You were convicted of 39 felonies for cybercrime
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.920]   placed on the US most wanted list in 2006,
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.680]   escaped from prison.
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.240]   You built the first organized cybercrime community
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.120]   called Shadow Crew that is the precursor
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.860]   to today's darknet and darknet markets.
[00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.280]   And for all this, the US intelligence service
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.520]   called you the original internet godfather.
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.920]   So first question, how did your career
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.300]   as a cybercrime criminal begin?
[00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.920]   - My life of crime begins when I'm 10 years old.
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.440]   10 years old, man, think about that.
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.340]   I mean, you were probably playing with robots
[00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.720]   when you were 10.
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.400]   Usually kids are doing the Lego bit,
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.120]   getting involved with sports, everything else.
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.080]   And with me, it wasn't like that.
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.320]   With me, I'm from Eastern Kentucky.
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.140]   Eastern Kentucky is one of these,
[00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.340]   it's like parts of Texas, parts of Louisiana,
[00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.280]   that if you're not fortunate enough to have a job,
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.640]   you may be involved in a scam, hustle, fraud,
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:14.880]   whatever you wanna call it, man.
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.880]   I was, my parents, my mom was basically
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.360]   the captain of the entire fraud industry.
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.440]   So this is a woman that at one point,
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.720]   she's stealing a 108,000 pound Caterpillar D9 bulldozer,
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.240]   tramming it down the road.
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.240]   You know, at another point, she's taking a slip and fall
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.640]   in a convenience store trying to sue the owner.
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.880]   We had a neighbor she acted as a pimp for at one point.
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.200]   That's my mom.
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.800]   My dad.
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.520]   - Wait, wait, a neighbor acted as a pimp?
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.560]   - My mom prostituted, I mean,
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.080]   she acted as a pimp for a neighbor.
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.440]   Her name was Debbie, and my mom used to sell her out.
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.440]   You know, Debbie needed money,
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.680]   and my mom would find men for her to sleep with for cash,
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.560]   and she'd take a part of the cash.
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.080]   - So it sounds like she diversified the methodologies
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.920]   by which she hustled.
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.840]   - Very, had that entrepreneurial spirit.
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:10.680]   - Okay.
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.160]   - You know, we see that a lot with cyber criminals,
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.680]   you know, that sense of being that entrepreneur.
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.200]   - So what was the motivation, you think, for her?
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.640]   Is it money?
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:27.080]   Is it basically the rush of playing with the system
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.920]   or being able to know the rules and break the rules
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:32.960]   and get away with it?
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.700]   - My mom's a complex character.
[00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.900]   She is, there's no one single motivation.
[00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.640]   So my mom was the individual, she's still alive.
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:44.440]   My mom was the individual who tested people.
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.040]   She wanted to know how far she could abuse you
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.200]   and you come back and still love her.
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.920]   So, and that was with every relationship she's ever had.
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.120]   She would cheat on the men she was involved with.
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.320]   She would abuse the, her children, me and Denise.
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:00.840]   She would--
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.280]   - Psychological, physical?
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.240]   - Oh, it was mental, emotional, physical,
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.440]   everything, everything.
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:12.160]   I mean, she used to beat me and Denise with belt buckles,
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.160]   you know, and that ended when she was,
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.320]   I forgot what we had done.
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:19.160]   It wasn't much.
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:24.160]   I think that it may have been the part where she accused me
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:29.240]   of stealing her marijuana, but she was hitting me and Denise.
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.680]   We were living in a single wide trailer at that point.
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:33.840]   She was hitting me and Denise.
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.920]   We were on the bed trying to get away from it.
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:40.720]   And Denise kicks her through a closet is what happens.
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.720]   And Denise stands up and she said,
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.720]   you're through hitting me.
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:49.080]   And that was the last time that mom hit us at that point.
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.240]   But--
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.640]   - So sorry to take us there.
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.680]   You're, for people who know you
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.200]   and people should definitely watch
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.120]   some of your lectures online.
[00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:01.240]   You're extremely charismatic and fun and jolly
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.160]   and whatever word you wanna use.
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:06.760]   But, you know, if we look at that kind of life,
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:10.900]   there's darkness there, there's a struggle there.
[00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.320]   - There's a lot of darkness.
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:16.480]   - So, how did you feel?
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:20.000]   If you go back to the mind of the kid you were
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.200]   with your mom, was there sadness?
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:28.280]   Was there things like depression, self-doubt,
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.400]   all those kinds of things?
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.680]   Or did you see this crime, this chaos
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.720]   as ultimately exciting?
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.160]   - You know, I don't think,
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.880]   back then I didn't view it as exciting.
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.160]   Now it becomes exciting when I start being involved
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.320]   in cyber crime, all right?
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:44.920]   But back then it was simply a means to an end,
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:45.760]   was all it was.
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:46.840]   So you take a 10 year old kid
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.600]   and the way I get involved in crime is,
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.440]   like I said, my mom was the fraudster,
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:53.520]   my dad was a good guy.
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:55.920]   He just forgot he was this good guy.
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:58.360]   You know, he always had these principles.
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:02.400]   But his issue was, is he loved my mom so much,
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:04.840]   he was scared of her leaving.
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:07.960]   So if she wanted to do something, commit crime,
[00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:11.320]   cheat on him, whatever, he would pretty much
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:13.080]   just put up with it.
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:14.680]   The one instant.
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.760]   So, I mean, this woman used to,
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.280]   she used to bring men home in front of him,
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.040]   tell him that, "Hey, I'm leaving you.
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.060]   "I don't love you anymore.
[00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:24.160]   "I want you to die, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.320]   This was my mom.
[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:29.200]   There were two instances where the man,
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.000]   where he can't take it anymore.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.680]   And the first instance, I was,
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:36.360]   I guess I was seven or eight.
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.600]   My sister Denise is a year younger than I am.
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:41.080]   My dad actually files for divorce.
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:42.840]   Files for divorce at that point.
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:44.940]   My mom kind of goes crazy.
[00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:49.080]   My dad, I was with my dad, my sister was with my mother,
[00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.800]   because that's that Eastern Kentucky mentality.
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.600]   You know, men stay with men, women stay with women.
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:57.880]   So, he was filing for divorce.
[00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:00.560]   Me and my dad, we were living in an apartment.
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:03.840]   My mom was living with her grandparents
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:04.680]   and with her parents,
[00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:06.480]   bouncing back and forth between the two.
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.760]   And I remember, I was sleeping in the bed.
[00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:09.840]   We had a single wide bed.
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:12.160]   My dad slept on the sofa.
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.640]   I woke up one night and there was some sort of ruckus
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:16.000]   in the living room.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.520]   So, I wake up and I walk into the living room
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:22.120]   and my mom has a knife to my dad's throat.
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:25.140]   And basically, "You're not gonna steal my son from me."
[00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:28.040]   My mom was this individual that,
[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:29.680]   when she knew she went so far,
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:32.240]   like I said, she was always this person that tested.
[00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:35.000]   Well, can I do this to you and you'll still come back?
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.960]   She knew, she was always also this person
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:42.640]   that if she went too far, she knew it
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:45.080]   and she would always try to divert that
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.320]   into something else.
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:48.940]   All right, so, she knew at that point she'd went too far.
[00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:50.160]   So, what does she do?
[00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:53.680]   She gets up crying, goes to the bathroom
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:56.760]   and pretends to slit her wrists
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:00.040]   so that my dad, Ray, will respond to that,
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:02.520]   not respond to what she's just done to him.
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:03.800]   That was my mom in a nutshell.
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:06.160]   She had a history of doing this kind of stuff.
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.820]   Motivations as far as fraud with her,
[00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:11.480]   I think with her it was,
[00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:17.000]   she was an LPN, she had, and a very good nurse.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.680]   But she didn't want to work, was a lot of it.
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:25.400]   So, with her, it was easier for her to commit fraud.
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:26.680]   And when I say commit fraud,
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:29.520]   it was against businesses, against people.
[00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:31.720]   I remember at one point she's buying
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:34.760]   over-the-counter capsules and emptying the capsules out
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:36.480]   and putting some other crap in there
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:39.280]   and selling it at speed and people were buying it.
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:41.160]   She did anything she could for money.
[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:42.520]   And of course, I get involved with that.
[00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:46.960]   What happens is, we were in Panama City at that point
[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:50.720]   and my mom leaves my dad.
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.080]   And the way she left my dad,
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:55.840]   my great-grandfather had died.
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:58.360]   My mom tells all three of us,
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.560]   "Hey, I'm taking the kids and we're going back
[00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:02.760]   to Eastern Kentucky to attend the funeral."
[00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:05.360]   Well, that was her leaving.
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:06.280]   Me and Denise didn't know,
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:07.980]   she didn't pack any of our clothes at all.
[00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:11.040]   She stows her clothes in the trunk of the car
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:12.360]   and she leaves my dad.
[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:13.680]   And I don't get to see my dad again
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:16.920]   for I think five, six years, something like that.
[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:17.840]   My mom, like I said,
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.940]   she used to bring men home in front of my dad.
[00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:22.840]   She would, he'd sit there and cry and beg her not to do it.
[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:23.880]   She'd do it anyway.
[00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:28.120]   When she leaves him, she kept up that.
[00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:31.720]   So we were living at my grandparents' house.
[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:33.500]   My grandfather, he had converted the house.
[00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:35.040]   He had raised the house up
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:37.320]   and built apartments underneath of it.
[00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:39.200]   So me and my sister and my mom
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.880]   lived in one of the apartments underneath.
[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:44.640]   And that whole side of the family was just nuts.
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:45.480]   Was nuts.
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:48.260]   My granddad, Paul, he would,
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.320]   this is a man that,
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:56.360]   he didn't want you to eat any of his food.
[00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:58.120]   So, you know, there was no such thing
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.360]   as me and Denise going upstairs to eat.
[00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:03.800]   If he found out me and Denise was taking a bath,
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:06.840]   we were allowed to bath and bathe in two inches of water,
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:07.880]   one time a week,
[00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:10.040]   because he didn't want to have to pay the water bill.
[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:10.880]   - There's rules.
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:11.720]   - There are rules.
[00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:14.600]   You know, if you couldn't have the TV on,
[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:15.920]   when he went to bed at night,
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:17.340]   you had to have the television,
[00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:20.400]   the volume, you could watch it, but without volume.
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:21.440]   Because if he heard it,
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:23.520]   he would get up in the middle of the night
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:25.280]   and he would kick the power breaker,
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:26.960]   turn off all the power on you.
[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:29.280]   This is my, this is my, the family, right?
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:32.320]   So my mom, she used to leave me and Denise at home
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.480]   for days, man, for days.
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:36.880]   She'd go out and, you know, party.
[00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:40.360]   And I mean, sometimes she'd take me and Denise with her.
[00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:41.740]   We'd wait in the car.
[00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:43.880]   Sometimes we'd wait in the living room
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:46.220]   as she went and partied and everything else.
[00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:48.320]   Most of the time she left us at home.
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:52.840]   And my entry into crime, Denise walks in one day,
[00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.640]   she's nine years old, man.
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:55.520]   She walks in one day
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:57.920]   and she's got a pack of pork chops in her hand.
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:00.200]   And looked at her and I said, "Where'd you get that?"
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:01.940]   She's like, "I stole it."
[00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:04.400]   And, you know, it's like, "Show me how you did that."
[00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:07.000]   So she takes me over and she shows me how she steals food,
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.080]   how she's stuffing it down her pants.
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.120]   So we start stealing food.
[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:11.840]   I'm like, "Hell yeah, let's do that shit."
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:13.400]   So start stealing food.
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:16.000]   And we get to the point where we're wanting a sandwich.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.500]   Well, you can't stuff a loaf of bread down your pants.
[00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:20.940]   So there was a Kmart in the shopping center.
[00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:25.340]   I go over to the Kmart, get a hoodie off the rack,
[00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:28.420]   take the tags off of it, wear it out, worked just fine.
[00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:30.580]   And the way you steal bread is you put the hoodie
[00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:32.860]   over your shoulder, stuff a loaf of bread down the sleeve
[00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:34.320]   and you walk out with it.
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:35.380]   So we started doing that.
[00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:36.820]   - How'd you figure that out?
[00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:38.180]   - Just thought pattern.
[00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:43.180]   - So there's like strategic thinking here.
[00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:45.340]   - Yeah, you know, you can't wear the hoodie
[00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:48.040]   and put the bread down here 'cause you might mash the bread
[00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:48.880]   when you zip it up or they might notice.
[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:50.460]   - Yeah, we have to think through that.
[00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:51.740]   - You gotta think through it.
[00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:53.780]   But you gotta realize by this point,
[00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:57.100]   I'm already seeing what my parents are doing.
[00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:58.420]   You know, I'm already seeing it.
[00:13:58.420 --> 00:13:59.500]   Just seeing it plodding.
[00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:01.540]   - That kind of puzzle solving was something
[00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:03.180]   you were already developing yourself into as a kid
[00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:04.180]   'cause you're pretty young.
[00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:05.820]   - Yeah, 10 years old, pretty young.
[00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:08.380]   But seeing how they act, how they respond to things.
[00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:11.220]   And my mom, I guess you'd call it a good thing,
[00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:14.460]   they never kept any of that hidden from the kids.
[00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:17.660]   You know, there was no discussions behind closed doors.
[00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:19.260]   All that happened in front of everybody.
[00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:22.300]   - And from your young mind's perspective,
[00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:25.900]   seeing that kind of crime, you basically,
[00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:27.620]   you know, a lot of us kind of grow up
[00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:29.780]   thinking there's rules you're not supposed to break.
[00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:31.900]   If you see other humans breaking those rules,
[00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:35.660]   then you realize those rules are just human made.
[00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:37.060]   - But it gets worse than that.
[00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:41.860]   I was in an environment where there were no decent people.
[00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:44.980]   I didn't really meet my first decent person
[00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:47.100]   until I was 16 years old.
[00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:47.940]   - Who was that?
[00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:49.860]   - That was a high school teacher.
[00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:54.420]   So what happens is, you know, we start shoplifting food.
[00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:56.660]   My mom finds out that we've been stealing stuff
[00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:58.980]   and, you know, she joins us.
[00:14:58.980 --> 00:14:59.820]   - What's that?
[00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:00.780]   - She joins us.
[00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:01.620]   - Yeah, she comes in.
[00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:02.700]   You know, I've got the Intellivision,
[00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:05.020]   I've got the Atari 2600, playing the hell out of it.
[00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:05.860]   - Oh my God.
[00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:06.820]   - She starts seeing this shit,
[00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:07.940]   she's like, "Where'd this come from?"
[00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:09.100]   And I'm like, "Well, we found it."
[00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:11.380]   She's like, "You didn't find that, Denise."
[00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:13.420]   Denise stands up, "We stole it.
[00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:16.660]   "My mom, show me how you did that."
[00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:19.500]   And she gets her mom too, to join in.
[00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:20.740]   And she used to run me and Denise
[00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:21.940]   as these little shoplifters.
[00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:24.500]   We'd take, you know, we'd steal stuff for her,
[00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:27.740]   we would distract security,
[00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:30.820]   and her and my grandmother would steal stuff.
[00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:32.380]   They got caught doing that.
[00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:34.900]   But that's the entry into crime.
[00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:37.620]   And Denise, you know, I'm adamant,
[00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:39.980]   and I kinda mean it.
[00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:45.780]   But the truth is, I say, and I do mean it,
[00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:48.980]   that I'm responsible for my choices as an adult.
[00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:49.820]   All right?
[00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:51.300]   I believe that when you're a child,
[00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:52.260]   you can't control that.
[00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:55.020]   The adults in your environment control what you do.
[00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:55.860]   All right?
[00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:58.900]   Once you're an adult, though, your choices are yours.
[00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:01.740]   Now, that being said, there's some,
[00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:06.060]   you can't dismiss that childhood
[00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:10.860]   influencing what I did as an adult.
[00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:12.140]   You can't do that.
[00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:14.980]   I mean, it was kinda written on slate that,
[00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:18.260]   hey, this guy's gonna be this guy when he grows up.
[00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.740]   - That said, like, sometimes that one person you meet,
[00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:23.820]   that decent person, can turn the tide of your life.
[00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:24.660]   - Absolutely.
[00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:26.620]   So what happens is, you know, the abuse,
[00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:28.060]   everything continues on.
[00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:33.540]   When I'm 15, my dad was in Panama City, Florida.
[00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:37.100]   My mom was in, you know, we were in Hazard, Kentucky.
[00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:40.500]   She was dating this guy.
[00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:42.580]   My mom was this woman that,
[00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:48.100]   the abuse would, it was crazy abuse, man.
[00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:49.500]   Just crazy stuff.
[00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:52.020]   She would tell me and my sister, you know,
[00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:55.100]   that she gave up her life for us,
[00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:57.660]   that she was gonna leave one day and never come back,
[00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:00.220]   that we'd find her dead in a ditch someplace.
[00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:02.060]   She'd go out and date these men, and she'd come back,
[00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:05.620]   and she'd talk about how these men were abusing her.
[00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:07.540]   You know, so she'd be dating this guy,
[00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:10.660]   and she'd come back and she'd, you know,
[00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:13.060]   start talking about how he had tried to rape her,
[00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:14.620]   you know, trying to get me to respond to that.
[00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:16.060]   And I would respond to that.
[00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:18.460]   Make no doubt, I would respond to that.
[00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:21.260]   Well, what happens is, and I knew that,
[00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:23.860]   I don't know if I knew it was abuse at that age, all right,
[00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:25.500]   but I knew things were fucked up.
[00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:29.020]   I was talking to my dad in Panama City,
[00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:31.340]   and I really had it in my head that,
[00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:34.860]   that I was gonna go down and live with my dad.
[00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:40.460]   And I called my dad one day.
[00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:42.900]   I was set to go to, me and my cousins
[00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:45.220]   were gonna go see "Return of the Jedi."
[00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:48.140]   It had come out again in the theaters.
[00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:50.460]   So I called my dad, it was a Sunday.
[00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:54.460]   Called my dad, and he told me he had either gotten married
[00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:56.860]   or he was about to get married to this woman.
[00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:59.460]   And basically, Brett Johnson
[00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:01.140]   wasn't gonna go down to Florida.
[00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:03.620]   You know, I was gonna stay in Hazard.
[00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:05.020]   Had to call my dad from payphone,
[00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:09.420]   but the result of that was I walked into a hospital,
[00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:12.460]   got in an elevator,
[00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:16.820]   and a woman got in the elevator at the same time,
[00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:21.180]   and I snapped and beat the hell out of her, right there.
[00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:22.620]   And I was 15.
[00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:27.300]   Didn't really know what the fuck happened.
[00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:28.980]   Didn't really know, but--
[00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:30.500]   Just anger came from somewhere.
[00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:32.060]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:37.060]   And, you know, the elevator,
[00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:39.980]   beat the hell out of this lady.
[00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:42.460]   Turned out she looked a shitload like my mom.
[00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:48.740]   But the elevator doors opened.
[00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:51.380]   One of the security guards,
[00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:53.500]   I played basketball with his son.
[00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:55.140]   So he saw me immediately.
[00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:58.620]   I knocked the hell out of him, took off running,
[00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:00.180]   made it back to the house
[00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:02.900]   where my grandparents were.
[00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:03.980]   They didn't know what had happened,
[00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:06.540]   so I didn't say anything.
[00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:10.140]   About an hour later, Kentucky State Police,
[00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:12.300]   they pull up in the front yard.
[00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:13.780]   And two of them get out,
[00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:15.500]   and I'm sitting on the front porch,
[00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:16.620]   and me and my cousins are,
[00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:18.100]   and they start walking up,
[00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:19.540]   everybody starts walking out of the house.
[00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:21.020]   And I'm like, I just remember saying,
[00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:22.220]   "What do you want, what do you want?"
[00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:23.860]   Well, you know what they wanted.
[00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:26.060]   They wanted to arrest Brett Johnson.
[00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:27.780]   And they arrested me.
[00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:29.740]   I went in, I told them everything.
[00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:33.220]   Spent three months in a county jail.
[00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:37.580]   They didn't have juvenile facilities in that county,
[00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:39.700]   so I spent three months in solitary.
[00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:44.740]   Went to trial, pled guilty to assault in the first degree.
[00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:48.500]   The judge sentenced me to time served
[00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:50.180]   and a psychological evaluation,
[00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:52.620]   where they sent me to Louisville, Kentucky.
[00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:55.060]   And I spent 30 days up there,
[00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:55.900]   and they cut me loose.
[00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:59.180]   They wanted me to have counseling after that.
[00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:02.740]   And never went to counseling.
[00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:05.740]   You know, I wanted to, but mom was like, "Don't need it."
[00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:06.740]   (laughs)
[00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:08.140]   So never went to counseling.
[00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:13.140]   And I became this pariah in the county.
[00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:16.780]   It's crazy, man.
[00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:21.540]   I mean, not a day goes by that I don't think about that.
[00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:22.380]   That.
[00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:23.460]   - That moment in the elevator.
[00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:24.580]   - Yeah.
[00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:29.140]   And what happens is, you know, you're 15.
[00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:30.500]   Fuck, man, you're 15.
[00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:34.620]   So I go back to the high school that I was in,
[00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:38.700]   and I'm this piece of shit.
[00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:41.460]   - So everybody, you're not the outcast.
[00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:43.300]   - Everybody knows.
[00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:44.140]   So I move.
[00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:44.980]   We move.
[00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:47.140]   We were in Whitesburg at that point.
[00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:52.140]   I finish up the year there and move back to Perry County,
[00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:54.220]   which is where Hazard is.
[00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:57.940]   So we move there, and they've got three high schools there.
[00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:00.260]   They've got MC Napier, they've got Hazard High School,
[00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:02.700]   and then they've got Dill Scombs High School.
[00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:06.100]   So I was within, me and Denise were within
[00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:09.340]   half mile of MC Napier.
[00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:12.700]   Show up there the first day of school,
[00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:16.060]   and I met, me and my mom and my sister
[00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:17.900]   were walking into the school,
[00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:19.500]   and the kids won't let me in.
[00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:21.660]   The kids.
[00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:25.340]   Stand out there, he's not coming in.
[00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:28.980]   So my mom starts raising hell,
[00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:30.780]   and I'm like, "No, let's just go, let's go."
[00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:34.780]   So from there, we went down to the city school, Hazard,
[00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:36.860]   and the principal tells my mom,
[00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:39.540]   "Denise can come, he can't."
[00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:42.940]   So my mom wants to raise hell, and I'm like,
[00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:45.700]   "No, let's just take me to this other school."
[00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:48.340]   So this other school was like 15 miles away.
[00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:52.460]   And, you know, country high school.
[00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:57.140]   So I go there and they accept me,
[00:21:57.140 --> 00:21:59.220]   and I walked in the first day,
[00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:01.940]   and this English teacher,
[00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:05.340]   names Carol Combs,
[00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:10.340]   I walked in and handed her the paper,
[00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:11.980]   she was my homeroom teacher,
[00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:14.420]   and she heard this voice,
[00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:17.060]   as the way she explains it, she heard this voice.
[00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:21.340]   And she looks up and she was like,
[00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:24.140]   "Son, have you ever done any drama before?"
[00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:26.180]   (laughing)
[00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:27.580]   I'm like, "No, ma'am,
[00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:29.260]   but I'm interested in the academic team."
[00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:31.340]   I was this quick recall guy, right?
[00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:33.060]   And she's like, "No."
[00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:35.860]   She's like, "Drama."
[00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:37.540]   (laughing)
[00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:39.980]   I'm like, "No, I'm not interested in theater,
[00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:41.980]   I'm interested in academics."
[00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:44.500]   Well, she was the head of the drama department,
[00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:46.060]   and head of the academics department.
[00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:48.540]   So the deal was, tell you what,
[00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:50.460]   you can get on the academics team
[00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:53.140]   if you start with theater too.
[00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:54.820]   And I was like, "Okay."
[00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:56.820]   So what happens is she was the only,
[00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:58.740]   she was the first decent person I met in my life,
[00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:01.860]   and she became this kind of surrogate mother to me.
[00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:03.700]   So under her tutelage,
[00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:08.660]   I become one of the top academic team guys in the state.
[00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:11.420]   Around there, I was captain of the team,
[00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:15.780]   I was this, just scourge across all the counties
[00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:17.460]   in that part of Kentucky.
[00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:20.020]   We had a meet, it was like,
[00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:21.820]   "Jesus Christ, that's Brett Johnson."
[00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:24.060]   (laughing)
[00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:27.420]   She used to tell people they would,
[00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:29.940]   the high school that I came from was Whitesburg,
[00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:32.860]   and the first time that Whitesburg came against us,
[00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:35.780]   she told me, I was talking to her about a year ago,
[00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:37.940]   and she told me, she's like, "Brett,"
[00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:40.460]   she said, "That first meet against Whitesburg,"
[00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:44.660]   she said, "The captain came in, looked at you,
[00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:47.580]   and said, 'Oh, you've got that Johnson boy on your team?'"
[00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:49.540]   And she said, "My response was,
[00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:52.180]   'That Johnson boy is our team.'"
[00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:54.660]   (laughing)
[00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:57.740]   But I did that, and then with theater,
[00:23:57.740 --> 00:24:00.540]   I ended up, my senior year,
[00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:04.060]   I won best actor and actress in the state.
[00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:05.940]   Only guy to ever do that in the state.
[00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:08.940]   So, did pretty well, man, did pretty well.
[00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:11.900]   Had scholarships coming out of high school
[00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:14.500]   and everything else, and I'm the idiot that turned 'em down.
[00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:15.740]   - Can I ask you a funny question?
[00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:16.660]   - Yeah.
[00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:18.340]   - You'd make a hell of a, I mean,
[00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:20.220]   of all the many things you could probably do,
[00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:23.180]   you'd make a hell of a actor.
[00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:26.060]   - I'm very good on stage, I'm very good on stage.
[00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:28.460]   - Have you acted professionally anywhere?
[00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:31.300]   - Not professionally, we've done the college circuit,
[00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:32.140]   stuff like that.
[00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:36.060]   What happened was, so I turned down the scholarships.
[00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:40.180]   Scared of leaving, I guess is what it was.
[00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:41.860]   Started in community college,
[00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:44.140]   and the community college there
[00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:46.340]   hires a new theater director out of California.
[00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:48.620]   Well, he knew the guy that ran
[00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:50.940]   the San Jose State Theater Program.
[00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:53.060]   Guy named Edward Emanuel was his name.
[00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:56.340]   His claim to fame, he had written the Three Ninjas movie.
[00:24:56.340 --> 00:24:58.460]   Remember that, the three little ninja kids
[00:24:58.460 --> 00:24:59.300]   back in the '80s?
[00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:00.820]   He had written this for damn film,
[00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:02.940]   and it had made a shitload of money.
[00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:06.140]   So, he invites Ed Emanuel to come down and see the play,
[00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:09.140]   and Ed had written this Civil War piece.
[00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:11.460]   So, we put that on.
[00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:13.700]   I was doing like, it was a multiple role thing.
[00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:16.140]   I was doing like 18 different roles in the show.
[00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:19.580]   So, Ed sees the show, and he was like, "Scholarship."
[00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:21.100]   He said, "Look," he said, "Right now,
[00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:22.620]   "you're a big fish in a small pond.
[00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:24.220]   "We'll make you a big fish in a big pond."
[00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:25.660]   And I was like, "Deal!"
[00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:27.620]   So, I took the scholarship, man.
[00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:29.300]   And he was like, "I'll be back in two weeks."
[00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:30.420]   So, he flies out.
[00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:33.060]   Two weeks later, this guy flies back in.
[00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:35.420]   He drives down to where I'm living.
[00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:39.620]   I'm out shooting ball with my cousins and friends.
[00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:42.620]   He pulls up, and he gets out of the car,
[00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:43.940]   and I walk over to him.
[00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:45.740]   I was like, "Hey, man, I'll walk you in.
[00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:47.020]   "You can meet my parents."
[00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:48.500]   He's like, "No, I got it."
[00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:49.500]   I was like, "Okay."
[00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:50.460]   So, I keep shooting ball.
[00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:54.740]   He walks in the house, stays about 15 minutes,
[00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:58.580]   walks out, white as a sheet, doesn't say a word to me,
[00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:00.940]   gets in the car, leaves.
[00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:02.740]   I don't hear from him again.
[00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:04.740]   Had no idea what went on.
[00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:06.540]   Takes me a couple weeks.
[00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:10.580]   What happened is my mom, he walks in, introduces himself.
[00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:12.220]   My mom pulls a knife on the guy.
[00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:14.700]   "I will kill you.
[00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:17.700]   "You are not gonna steal my goddamn son from me."
[00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:19.340]   Scares the guy to death.
[00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:20.540]   He bugs out.
[00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:24.020]   And kinda broke my spirit at that point.
[00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:27.020]   You know, I was like, "Okay."
[00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:32.020]   So, went into, just full-fledged into scams,
[00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:34.060]   crimes, everything else.
[00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:37.220]   I had already been, when I was a minor,
[00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:39.700]   I'd already been kinda brought up on that side
[00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:41.340]   of the family with the crimes that they were doing.
[00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:45.380]   My mom was drug trafficking, the pimp stuff,
[00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:48.780]   illegally mining coal, charity fraud.
[00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:50.100]   - Illegally mining coal?
[00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:51.380]   - Yeah, wildcatting coal.
[00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:52.220]   So, you--
[00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:53.060]   - Can you explain that?
[00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:55.980]   - Yeah, so, to properly mine coal,
[00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:58.580]   you have to get a permit, all right?
[00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:00.460]   Eastern Kentucky, a lot of people don't,
[00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:01.980]   they can't afford the permits.
[00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:04.100]   You know, they can get 'em a piece of equipment.
[00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:05.420]   You know, you get a dozier or a loader,
[00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:06.420]   or whatever you're gonna get,
[00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:08.260]   or an auger, or what have you.
[00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:10.740]   So, you start mining, but you don't get the permit.
[00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:14.500]   So, you don't have to pay, back then it was like $3,500
[00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:17.580]   for a two-acre permit, or $5,000 for a two-acre permit.
[00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:20.540]   Let you strip mine the coal on that.
[00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:22.780]   Then you have to pay for the reclamation on top of that.
[00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:25.740]   So, once you uncover the pit, take the coal out,
[00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:27.660]   you have to cover back up the pit,
[00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:30.420]   sow grass, make sure everything is environmentally friendly.
[00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:32.940]   You gotta have a silt pond, everything else at that point.
[00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:35.020]   - So, the whole idea is you buy an acre of land,
[00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:36.940]   or some area of land, and then you can,
[00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:38.540]   there's a whole process you're supposed to go through.
[00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:39.380]   - Entire process.
[00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:41.940]   - How many people are involved in a mining,
[00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:43.980]   the smallest number of people required
[00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:45.060]   for a mining operation?
[00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:46.820]   - You can do it with three or four people.
[00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:47.660]   - Okay.
[00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:48.480]   - So, you've got your loader operator,
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:49.900]   you've got your dozier operator.
[00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:52.860]   You need, you can farm out the trucking to someone,
[00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:56.540]   if you need, or a trucking company, if you need to do that.
[00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:58.700]   Then you've got your, whoever owns the business as well.
[00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:01.780]   So, very few people can run an operation like that,
[00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:05.660]   and profit fairly well, as long as you don't have to do
[00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:08.860]   the reclamation, all that crap on top of it, all right?
[00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:10.900]   The reclamation gets pretty expensive.
[00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:12.860]   So, if you're uncovering a pit of coal,
[00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:18.100]   a pit, so a ton of coal is basically about 36 cubic inches,
[00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:20.700]   is what 2,000 pounds of coal weighs,
[00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:21.860]   if you're in Eastern Kentucky,
[00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:24.420]   'cause it's the weight of the bituminous coal
[00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:25.260]   and everything.
[00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:26.380]   - The fact that you know this is awesome.
[00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:28.420]   (laughing)
[00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:33.420]   The fact that you know exactly the volume of a ton of coal,
[00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:34.300]   I mean, this is great.
[00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:35.460]   - Yeah, you learn this shit, right?
[00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:36.580]   You can rattle this shit off.
[00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:40.180]   So, you uncover the pit, and then you've got to sell the pit.
[00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:41.820]   Well, the thing is, is that,
[00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:43.180]   where are you gonna sell the coal?
[00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:45.660]   Well, you sell it to one of these other coal tipples
[00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:48.620]   that knows that they're buying the shit illegally.
[00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:50.600]   So, back then, a ton of coal was,
[00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:54.100]   they'd give you like 36 bucks per ton, is what that is.
[00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:56.660]   And you'd have to go out, and you'd test the BTUs on it.
[00:28:56.660 --> 00:28:58.980]   You'd take a sample to the lab, test the BTUs.
[00:28:58.980 --> 00:28:59.820]   You'd take that into the company.
[00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:00.780]   - What's BTU?
[00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:02.200]   - British Thermal Unit.
[00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:04.740]   So, you'd test what the BTU on the coal was.
[00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:05.860]   - How pure the coal is.
[00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:08.900]   - How pure the coal is, what BTU it burns at.
[00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:12.540]   Back then, a good BTU was around 12.9,
[00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:14.100]   was what you'd get, all right?
[00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:17.020]   So, 12.9 coal, $36 a ton.
[00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:19.400]   You'd take that sample over to the coal tipple.
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:21.460]   They'd say, "Okay, we'll buy this for you.
[00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:23.140]   "How many trucks you got, or how many tons you got?"
[00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:24.700]   And you'd say, "This is what we've got."
[00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:26.160]   Then you'd hire the trucking company.
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:29.900]   And where you get it out, because you've got the agents
[00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:32.260]   that are looking for you by this point,
[00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:35.980]   because the people that, you've bought the rights
[00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:37.620]   to whoever the landowner is.
[00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:39.620]   You said you're gonna give them $2 a ton,
[00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:41.340]   or whatever this is.
[00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:44.240]   Well, the other people there, are you paying them off?
[00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:45.200]   Or are you not?
[00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:47.020]   Well, if you're not paying them off, guess what?
[00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:49.900]   They know you're mining it illegally.
[00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:50.940]   They're gonna report you.
[00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:53.180]   Well, all of a sudden, you've got all these inspectors
[00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:54.340]   that are coming around and everything.
[00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:55.900]   And hey, we know what you're doing.
[00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:57.540]   So they're looking for you to get the pit out.
[00:29:57.540 --> 00:29:58.920]   So when do you get the pit out?
[00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:00.140]   Right in the dead of night.
[00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:03.080]   So you're loading it up two o'clock in the morning,
[00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:04.780]   hauling it's ass out is what you're doing.
[00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:06.120]   You sell it out from there.
[00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:08.980]   And your mom ran operations like this?
[00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:10.260]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:12.540]   And you said you worked the mine too, when you were younger?
[00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:14.220]   Yeah, I learned how to run a loader, run a dozer.
[00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:16.160]   Learned how to clean off a pit.
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:17.700]   Everything like that.
[00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:22.060]   So this is the lifestyle you grow up in.
[00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:23.700]   You learn how to do this stuff.
[00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:28.540]   So I knew how to do charity fraud as well, insurance fraud.
[00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:31.820]   Charity fraud, can we break down some of these?
[00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:34.580]   Charity fraud, it's much more romantic than what it sounds.
[00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:39.340]   It was basically, it was basically standing beside the road
[00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:42.500]   with a sign and a bucket, taking up collections
[00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:44.860]   for homeless shelters, for abused women,
[00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:47.560]   for children, stuff like that.
[00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:49.660]   Then later on, I branched off.
[00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:51.020]   When I started off on my own,
[00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:53.380]   I would set up my own charity company
[00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:55.140]   and do some telemarketing and go on by
[00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:57.100]   and collect checks and things like that.
[00:30:57.100 --> 00:30:58.140]   We're gonna talk about that,
[00:30:58.140 --> 00:30:59.860]   but actually, can we just step back
[00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:04.260]   and talk about your mom and your dad?
[00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:08.100]   Given all of that, given all the abuse,
[00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:12.300]   the complex ways that she played with love,
[00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:15.700]   to see how far she can push you and the people around her,
[00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:20.700]   and they still love her, today, do you love her?
[00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:22.700]   I called my dad yesterday.
[00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:24.500]   My dad, he's dying now.
[00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:25.540]   He's got a heart condition.
[00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:27.380]   He's not gonna get the operation to fix it.
[00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:29.220]   So he's like, "Fuck it, I'm ready to go."
[00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:32.700]   And I'm like, I looked at him, 'cause hell, I'm 52 now.
[00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:35.200]   Prior to 52, I'd have been like, "No, you need to do this."
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:38.340]   But I looked at him and I was like, "I understand.
[00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:40.480]   "I understand, you're done."
[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:42.820]   And so he's not gonna get the operation.
[00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:44.260]   I was talking to him yesterday and he asked me,
[00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:45.820]   he's like, "Have you seen your mom?"
[00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:47.060]   And I was like, "Dad, I've not talked to her
[00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:48.700]   "for about two years."
[00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:52.580]   And I told him, I was like, "I love my mom,
[00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:55.660]   "but my mom is not a good person, she's not."
[00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:59.220]   And he told me, I was talking to him on the phone yesterday,
[00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:01.820]   and he told me that it took him several years
[00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:03.500]   to really understand that.
[00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:05.580]   He loved her too, but it takes,
[00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:07.500]   when you're getting abused like that,
[00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:09.960]   especially my dad, my dad came from a good family,
[00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:13.040]   everything else, and upstanding family.
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:17.380]   I think that when you're that victim of abuse,
[00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:21.420]   you've never seen it before, you've never encountered it,
[00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:24.700]   and then it happens, well, you're like that frog in water
[00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:27.220]   all of a sudden, you get to the point where
[00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:30.100]   gradually increases until how do you get out of it?
[00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:32.820]   Everybody else sees what's happening, but you don't.
[00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:34.740]   I grew up in that environment though,
[00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:39.060]   so it took me a long time to come to terms with that.
[00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:42.180]   My sister came to terms with it long before I did.
[00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:45.820]   My sister, she's been a decade without talking to my mom,
[00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:48.380]   like she had tried to commit suicide, I didn't know that.
[00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:51.700]   What got me so bad is she said at one point
[00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:55.980]   that she always thought someone was gonna come in
[00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:59.140]   and save us, and my response, just immediate response,
[00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:00.820]   not even thinking about it, my response was,
[00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:03.500]   well, Denise, I knew no one ever was.
[00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:07.020]   And looking at things now,
[00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:10.340]   I think that's where our paths diverged.
[00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:14.300]   Me, it was, if you wanna do it,
[00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:15.500]   if anybody's gonna take care of you,
[00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:16.900]   you gotta take care of yourself.
[00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:17.820]   - You're on your own.
[00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:18.820]   - You're on your own.
[00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:21.180]   It's up to you.
[00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:24.580]   And Denise has always been that child
[00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:28.300]   that has expected someone to come in and save her.
[00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:30.940]   - Well, and almost like, it's all going to be okay,
[00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:34.060]   somebody-- - Yeah, and I knew it wasn't.
[00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:36.220]   No, no, you go-- - Unless you--
[00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:38.960]   - Unless you make it okay, it ain't gonna be okay.
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:45.760]   - Are you able to forgive her, your mom?
[00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:47.880]   - My boundary with my mom,
[00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:50.080]   the reason I've not spoken with her,
[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:55.080]   over two years ago, I started this legal career of mine,
[00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:59.720]   I've been the guy who has, I spent a lot of time
[00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:02.260]   thinking about my past and those choices
[00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:04.240]   and what brought those choices around.
[00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:06.780]   So I'm big about taking responsibility for my actions.
[00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:08.240]   I truly am, I think it's really important
[00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:09.560]   you have to do that.
[00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:12.560]   Well, my mom, not so much.
[00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:14.720]   So I was talking to her, you know,
[00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:16.280]   and I would start saying, you know,
[00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:19.320]   she would start the conversation talking about
[00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:20.840]   she didn't understand why Denise
[00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:22.280]   wouldn't speak to her anymore.
[00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:24.200]   That was one of her tropes.
[00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:26.040]   So, and my response started to become,
[00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:28.800]   well, because you were the abuser
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:31.100]   and you spent your life doing that to her,
[00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:34.360]   so it's more healthy for her not to talk to you.
[00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:37.920]   - So she's still not able to see the flaws
[00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:41.160]   in her ways of the past. - No, no, not at all.
[00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:44.640]   So my ultimatum to my mom was, look,
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:47.720]   when you're able to admit that you abused
[00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:51.520]   the people in your life, accept that responsibility
[00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:55.840]   and be able to discuss it with me, we'll have a talk.
[00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:58.560]   Other than that, I don't wanna talk to you anymore.
[00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:00.520]   So for the first year, it was, you know,
[00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:03.740]   calling, cussing my wife out, cussing me out.
[00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:07.640]   You know, I don't need you, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:09.600]   And then finally it started to taper off
[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:12.300]   and she's never really contacted me after that point.
[00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:18.020]   - Your dad is dying. - Yeah.
[00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:21.140]   - What do you take from the way he's taken on death,
[00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:22.940]   just saying, fuck it?
[00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:25.460]   - You know, it's, the man--
[00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:27.740]   - And what have you learned from your dad?
[00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:30.100]   What do you love about your dad?
[00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:33.100]   - He's one of these guys that, you know, like I told him.
[00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:37.700]   I told my dad about the abuse and everything else
[00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:39.540]   and there was a point, so, you know,
[00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:41.220]   I told you about the elevator stuff.
[00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:43.660]   But before that, man, it was,
[00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:47.980]   it took me 40 years to talk about that.
[00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:52.980]   But it also took me 40 years to talk about,
[00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:58.820]   there was a point that my mom and dad would leave the house
[00:35:58.820 --> 00:36:04.420]   and I would urinate in the floor, all right?
[00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:05.260]   And--
[00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:09.300]   - Like, out of anger?
[00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:11.700]   - No idea why, all right?
[00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:13.820]   But I would, piss on the carpet.
[00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:16.180]   Carpet pissers like the Lebowski, right?
[00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:18.420]   (laughing)
[00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:20.340]   It really tied the room together, dude.
[00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:22.140]   - It really tied the room together.
[00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:24.300]   - I was talking about that and this lady comes up to me
[00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:29.300]   after the presentation and she had a career previous to that
[00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:31.900]   where she dealt with abused kids.
[00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:34.260]   And she told me, she's like, Brett, she's like,
[00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:37.260]   it's a control mechanism.
[00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:40.100]   The only control you had was that.
[00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:42.180]   And she's like, kids do that.
[00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:43.540]   And I was like, so I'm not unique?
[00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:45.660]   She's like, no, you're not unique in that.
[00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:49.580]   So, you know, this whole history of abuse,
[00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:51.800]   Denise dealt with it by drinking,
[00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:55.140]   by trying to commit suicide, things like that.
[00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:56.380]   And then finally she escapes.
[00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:57.220]   I'm the kid that didn't.
[00:36:57.220 --> 00:37:00.540]   And not only that, my wife pointed out to me that,
[00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:02.820]   again, it's that Eastern Kentucky mentality stuff.
[00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:04.820]   You know, the male's expected to do things.
[00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:08.700]   So with me, it was almost like I stepped up
[00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:12.220]   to take part in those crimes
[00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:14.620]   so that Denise didn't have to.
[00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:16.620]   And she was able to avoid all that.
[00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:18.180]   Other than that one shoplifting stuff,
[00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:19.980]   Denise doesn't break the law anymore.
[00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:22.860]   She goes off to be a, she's a good parent.
[00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:24.180]   She's an angry parent.
[00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:25.020]   She's a good parent.
[00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:27.780]   She's a teacher, good citizen overall.
[00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:30.980]   I was just the guy that kept right on going with it.
[00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:31.820]   - Kept on going.
[00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:33.020]   So let me ask you about that.
[00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:36.500]   So your life of cyber crime.
[00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:37.340]   (laughing)
[00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:40.260]   In describing some of the things you did or knew about,
[00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:43.740]   you said, quote, "I once stole several thousand dollars
[00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:47.180]   "worth of coins from a family trying to sell them
[00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:48.860]   "to put a new roof on their home.
[00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:52.940]   "Another time, I sent a counterfeit cashier's check
[00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:56.020]   "to a victim and he ended up being arrested for it.
[00:37:56.020 --> 00:37:58.640]   "I lied to family, friends, everyone I knew.
[00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:01.140]   "I was a truly despicable person."
[00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:02.420]   - True.
[00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:04.500]   - One of my Ukrainian associates,
[00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:07.220]   Script had someone who owed him money,
[00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:08.780]   kidnapped and tortured.
[00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:11.380]   He posted pictures of it online.
[00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:15.460]   Another member, Iceman, used to flood his enemy's
[00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:17.540]   email addresses with child pornography,
[00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:19.740]   then called the police on them.
[00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:20.820]   That's some stories.
[00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:23.900]   Can you tell some of these stories that stand out to you
[00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:28.900]   that are particularly despicable or representative
[00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:31.220]   or interesting when you look back
[00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:36.220]   that defined your approach and who you were at that time?
[00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:41.260]   - Let me say that I did not care about my victim.
[00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:44.980]   All right, I cared about me is what I cared about.
[00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:47.900]   It's rough to admit that.
[00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:51.780]   You don't give a shit what you're doing to anybody else.
[00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:52.820]   You only care about you.
[00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:54.280]   But that's the truth of the matter.
[00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:56.480]   I didn't care about the victims.
[00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:59.220]   The lady, that wasn't even at the beginning
[00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:01.540]   of my career as a cyber criminal,
[00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:03.060]   that was right at the last of it.
[00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:03.900]   - Which lady?
[00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:04.940]   - The coin lady.
[00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:07.500]   By that point, Shadow Crew had made
[00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:10.580]   the front cover of Forbes, August of '04.
[00:39:10.580 --> 00:39:13.860]   October 26th of '04, Secret Service had shut us down.
[00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:16.900]   33 people arrested, six countries in six hours.
[00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:20.620]   I was the guy that was publicly mentioned as getting away.
[00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:23.580]   What happened was is I was the guy who was,
[00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:25.700]   I had kind of invented this crime
[00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:27.860]   called tax return identity theft
[00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:29.980]   and was stealing a lot of money.
[00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:33.660]   I went through all my stateside savings
[00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:35.540]   and Shadow Crew gets shut down.
[00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:37.820]   I don't have any way to come in with any money,
[00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:40.900]   so I start running counterfeit cashier's checks,
[00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:42.380]   defrauding people with that,
[00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:45.840]   having them send products or bullion collections,
[00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:48.260]   what have you, by COD, collect on delivery,
[00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:51.080]   and I would pay with it with a counterfeit cashier's check.
[00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:54.060]   This lady was on eBay.
[00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:57.180]   She had been collecting these silver coins all of her life.
[00:39:57.180 --> 00:39:58.700]   You know, the US currency used to be,
[00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:00.420]   the coins used to be silver.
[00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:02.580]   So she had a whole collection of these things,
[00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:05.580]   like, I don't know, 80, 90 pounds of this stuff.
[00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:09.180]   And I'm a very good social engineer.
[00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:13.780]   So convinced her that I was a legitimate person,
[00:40:13.780 --> 00:40:16.060]   that, you know, hey, send it to COD.
[00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:18.740]   You can use my FedEx account to do that
[00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:20.580]   or my UPS account to do that.
[00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:23.460]   I'll pay with a cashier's check.
[00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:25.740]   You can take it in, same as cash.
[00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:26.600]   She believed that.
[00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:29.820]   She was even on the ad and we talked on the phone
[00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:30.660]   and everything else.
[00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:33.340]   She had told me that she was a single parent
[00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:34.940]   and it was the only money that she had
[00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:39.460]   to put a roof on the house for her and her kids.
[00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:41.460]   And I didn't give a damn.
[00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:42.300]   I didn't give a damn.
[00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:44.420]   What was more important was me at that point.
[00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:46.340]   - Can I ask you a question about the social engineering?
[00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:50.820]   So maybe specifics like the methodology,
[00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:52.900]   email, you said phone.
[00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:58.000]   Maybe you could discuss this process
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.320]   from a bigger philosophical perspective
[00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:03.520]   of what is it about human beings
[00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:06.680]   that makes impossible to be social engineer,
[00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:09.800]   to be victims of fraud?
[00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:14.800]   - So first let me say that I became a social engineer
[00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:20.040]   as a child, all right, because the adults in my environment,
[00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:23.480]   as a child, I had to know exactly what they were thinking
[00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:26.560]   and be able to try to manipulate that for survival.
[00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:31.260]   So I became a social engineer for survival initially.
[00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:32.740]   And one of the things that I've seen
[00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:35.320]   with a lot of cyber criminals is the exact same thing.
[00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:37.500]   They're really expert ones.
[00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:39.220]   They become a social engineer as a child,
[00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:43.180]   then later on they use those tools to victimize others.
[00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:46.220]   - Which is fascinating because in order to understand
[00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:47.060]   what others are thinking,
[00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:49.260]   you have to be extremely good at empathy.
[00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:52.180]   So you have to really put yourself in the shoes
[00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:53.540]   of the other person.
[00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:56.780]   And yet in order to do cyber crime,
[00:41:56.780 --> 00:42:00.980]   you have to not care about the pain
[00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:03.340]   that might cause them once you manipulate them.
[00:42:03.340 --> 00:42:07.100]   So you have to empathize and yet not care.
[00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:08.660]   - Exactly, and I would argue,
[00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:11.500]   I would argue that that is not a sociopath
[00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:13.740]   because a cyber criminal, and I was no different,
[00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:16.100]   most cyber criminals justify those actions.
[00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:18.780]   So the justification becomes what's important.
[00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:19.980]   With me, the justification was,
[00:42:19.980 --> 00:42:21.660]   well, I did it for my family.
[00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:22.540]   Did it for my wife.
[00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:24.340]   Did it for my stripper girlfriend.
[00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:26.540]   So, and I believe those justifications.
[00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:27.660]   - I'm just gonna tell you that
[00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:28.980]   'cause I care about love a lot.
[00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:33.980]   - Yeah, so the big picture of that is trust.
[00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:40.500]   How do you establish trust with a potential victim?
[00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:42.860]   All right, now I would argue online
[00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:45.160]   that that trust is established through a combination
[00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:48.060]   of technology, tools, social engineering.
[00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:50.380]   All right, so we trust our tech.
[00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:51.660]   You know, we trust our cell phones.
[00:42:51.660 --> 00:42:53.340]   We trust our laptops.
[00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:55.060]   A lot of times we don't understand how they operate,
[00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:57.020]   but we trust the news that comes across the line.
[00:42:57.020 --> 00:42:59.420]   We trust the phone numbers that show up.
[00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:02.380]   We trust IP addresses if we're advanced enough
[00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:04.100]   to look at an IP address or a domain
[00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:05.500]   or anything else like that.
[00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:07.580]   Criminals use tools to manipulate that.
[00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:10.240]   Spoof phone numbers, spoof browser fingerprints,
[00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:14.080]   whatever that may be, whatever the tool may be.
[00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:16.540]   Then that lays a base level of trust.
[00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:19.820]   At that point, you shoot in with the social engineering
[00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:21.500]   and lay whatever story that is
[00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:23.100]   in order to manipulate that victim
[00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:26.300]   to act not out of reason, but out of emotion
[00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:27.740]   all of a sudden.
[00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:30.380]   - This is fascinating about the way humans interact
[00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:34.600]   with the world, which is you're almost too afraid
[00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:35.440]   to not trust the world.
[00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:36.420]   You have to find a balance.
[00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:40.380]   You have a lot of sort of conspiracy theories now
[00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:42.940]   about distrust institutions and thinking like
[00:43:42.940 --> 00:43:44.060]   everything around us.
[00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:46.320]   It's like I've been listening to people
[00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:48.300]   who believe the earth is flat.
[00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:52.020]   And that conspiracy theory is fascinating to me
[00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:57.020]   because it basically says that you can't trust anybody.
[00:43:57.020 --> 00:44:00.460]   Like everything you hear is a lie.
[00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:03.300]   So that's one, you can live that life
[00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:04.980]   or you can live a life where you're just
[00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:06.780]   naively trusting everything.
[00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:08.840]   And we as humans have to, 'cause that life
[00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:13.220]   is kind of full of happiness if nobody screws you over.
[00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:16.620]   'Cause you meet people with the joyful heart
[00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:18.780]   and you get excited and all that kind of stuff.
[00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:21.980]   But if you do that too much, you're gonna get burned.
[00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:23.780]   So you have to find some kind of balance
[00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:28.740]   in terms of optimizing happiness where you trust,
[00:44:28.740 --> 00:44:32.000]   I mean, but verify, and on the internet
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.300]   that becomes really tricky.
[00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:36.020]   You're almost too afraid to distrust everything
[00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:38.820]   'cause you'll never get anything done on the internet.
[00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:41.340]   But then if you trust too much, you can get screwed over.
[00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:44.140]   And so the social engineering comes in
[00:44:44.140 --> 00:44:46.260]   where you're like, I'm not sure if I should
[00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:50.620]   trust this, you kind of help them build the narrative
[00:44:50.620 --> 00:44:51.620]   where it's like, it's good.
[00:44:51.620 --> 00:44:52.460]   - It's good.
[00:44:52.460 --> 00:44:53.280]   - It's good.
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:55.660]   - So in a lot of the times, that social engineering
[00:44:55.660 --> 00:45:00.660]   is just feeding into what the victim wants to believe.
[00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:01.540]   All right?
[00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:03.620]   It's not really coming up with a brand new story at all.
[00:45:03.620 --> 00:45:07.380]   It's just knowing what the motivations of that victim is,
[00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:08.940]   feeding into it at that point.
[00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:10.900]   So you have to, again, that social engineer
[00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:14.860]   has to almost immediately know what's driving
[00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:16.300]   that person that they're talking about.
[00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:18.620]   If I'm working on a phone, talking to someone
[00:45:18.620 --> 00:45:21.340]   over the phone, I have to know within seconds
[00:45:21.340 --> 00:45:23.300]   what I need to say, how I need to act
[00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:25.820]   to interact with that customer service agent
[00:45:25.820 --> 00:45:28.100]   or whoever I'm talking to on the other end of the line.
[00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:31.220]   - So fascinating because you truly are empathizing
[00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:32.060]   with the other person.
[00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:33.300]   - Absolutely.
[00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:36.540]   - What is it, this businessman, Steven Schwarzman,
[00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:40.540]   I've talked to a few times.
[00:45:40.540 --> 00:45:42.820]   He mentioned this thing that, you know,
[00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:47.820]   the way you build deep relationships is you really
[00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:51.220]   kind of notice the things that people are telling you,
[00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:56.140]   like what they want and what they're bothered by,
[00:45:56.140 --> 00:45:58.300]   what are their big problems in their lives?
[00:45:58.300 --> 00:46:00.900]   'Cause everybody's saying that all the time
[00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:02.500]   and most of us are just ignoring it.
[00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:03.340]   - Right.
[00:46:03.340 --> 00:46:05.420]   But if you take the time to listen,
[00:46:05.420 --> 00:46:07.180]   you know somebody at that point.
[00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:08.580]   Absolutely you do.
[00:46:08.580 --> 00:46:10.780]   Then you have to be able to dismiss it.
[00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:12.260]   - And dismiss it after.
[00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:14.380]   - You're looking for that just to see how I can
[00:46:14.380 --> 00:46:17.020]   manipulate that is what you're trying to do.
[00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:22.020]   So the lady was one story, another truly despicable story.
[00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:23.900]   We'll get to script in a second.
[00:46:23.900 --> 00:46:25.860]   But another truly despicable story,
[00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:28.940]   we were one of the really first groups
[00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:30.700]   that started phishing attacks.
[00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:31.540]   - What's phishing?
[00:46:31.540 --> 00:46:33.580]   - So that is a social engineering attack.
[00:46:33.580 --> 00:46:34.620]   - PH by the way, phishing.
[00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:36.780]   - Yeah, PH, that's another social engineering attack.
[00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:38.900]   That's sending that fake email out
[00:46:38.900 --> 00:46:40.580]   that looks like it's coming from a website
[00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:42.380]   or your financial organization or whatever
[00:46:42.380 --> 00:46:44.260]   and saying, "Hey, we've got a security problem.
[00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:46.980]   "We need you to update your account information."
[00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:50.500]   Well back then, no one had ever seen a phishing attack.
[00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:53.260]   So you could ask for all the information.
[00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:56.220]   You were getting just complete identity profiles
[00:46:56.220 --> 00:46:57.340]   on a phishing email.
[00:46:57.340 --> 00:46:58.340]   Nowadays you can't do that.
[00:46:58.340 --> 00:47:00.140]   Nowadays you look for basically credentials
[00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:01.980]   because everyone is aware of phishing.
[00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:03.860]   But back then it was complete information.
[00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:08.420]   We had phished out, I don't know, 200,000 eTrade accounts.
[00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:10.020]   That's what we had the login credentials for.
[00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:11.140]   - Login password, yeah.
[00:47:11.140 --> 00:47:13.900]   - Login password, complete social, date of birth,
[00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:17.740]   mother's maiden, account information, everything else.
[00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:20.380]   So we had access to those eTrade accounts.
[00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:24.180]   eTrade initially had no security in place.
[00:47:24.180 --> 00:47:26.180]   So you could cash out the account,
[00:47:26.180 --> 00:47:29.940]   ACH the money out to whatever account you wanted to,
[00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:31.540]   went through just fine.
[00:47:31.540 --> 00:47:34.060]   Ate 'em alive on that for four to six months.
[00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:38.660]   eTrade got to the point where you couldn't do
[00:47:38.660 --> 00:47:40.340]   any ACH coming out.
[00:47:40.340 --> 00:47:42.780]   They locked everything down.
[00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:46.340]   Well, you're still sitting on thousands of eTrade accounts.
[00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:47.860]   How do you make money on that?
[00:47:47.860 --> 00:47:51.540]   - That's a good question.
[00:47:51.540 --> 00:47:53.460]   - Yeah, so what you do is you find some fat cat
[00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:57.220]   that's got his retirement, invested in blue chips.
[00:47:57.220 --> 00:47:59.420]   Same time you find a penny stock,
[00:47:59.420 --> 00:48:01.540]   you open up a brand new account,
[00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:04.420]   buy into that penny stock, cash the fat cat out,
[00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:06.500]   buy into that same penny stock,
[00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:08.140]   bump and dump schemes all of a sudden.
[00:48:08.140 --> 00:48:11.020]   So you're destroying people's retirement accounts
[00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:12.940]   for just a few thousand dollars.
[00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:13.980]   Bam, bam, bam.
[00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:17.980]   And of course, eTrade's response is, not our problem.
[00:48:17.980 --> 00:48:19.900]   It's your problem, you shouldn't have given up your password
[00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:21.500]   or what have you at that point.
[00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:24.020]   And you still see that issue today with Zelle scams
[00:48:24.020 --> 00:48:25.340]   and things like that.
[00:48:25.340 --> 00:48:26.300]   - Which scam?
[00:48:26.300 --> 00:48:28.540]   - Zelle, so you know, the instant payment that--
[00:48:28.540 --> 00:48:29.820]   - Oh, so it's the same kind of operation,
[00:48:29.820 --> 00:48:32.260]   same type with different schemes and mechanisms.
[00:48:32.260 --> 00:48:35.420]   - You find an easy way to exploit a system
[00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:37.980]   and typically the financial organization,
[00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:40.180]   not our problem, our system's secure,
[00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:41.740]   it's the humans, it's their errors.
[00:48:41.740 --> 00:48:43.740]   Well, not really.
[00:48:43.740 --> 00:48:45.900]   You know, you've got some culpability in that
[00:48:45.900 --> 00:48:49.340]   and you're just trying to avoid paying part of the bill,
[00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:50.180]   is what's going on.
[00:48:50.180 --> 00:48:52.420]   - One of the things, just to stand fishing for a bit,
[00:48:52.420 --> 00:48:57.420]   is it really makes me sad 'cause there's been people
[00:48:57.420 --> 00:49:00.660]   on all kinds of platforms, including YouTube comments,
[00:49:00.660 --> 00:49:04.620]   but emails too, they figured out emails somehow.
[00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:09.620]   So people are now seeing the followers
[00:49:09.620 --> 00:49:13.940]   of this particular podcast who are fans,
[00:49:13.940 --> 00:49:16.860]   they're finding them on platforms like LinkedIn
[00:49:16.860 --> 00:49:21.420]   and YouTube and so on, and they are figuring out ways
[00:49:21.420 --> 00:49:24.400]   to get to those people by another channel,
[00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:29.400]   which I suppose seems more authentic to those people.
[00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:33.780]   So they send them an email from what looks like me
[00:49:34.660 --> 00:49:37.980]   and with this kind of like loving,
[00:49:37.980 --> 00:49:40.660]   the interesting thing, the emails sound like something
[00:49:40.660 --> 00:49:41.860]   I would write.
[00:49:41.860 --> 00:49:44.540]   So these aren't even, at this stage, it's not even,
[00:49:44.540 --> 00:49:47.460]   it doesn't feel automated or if it's automated,
[00:49:47.460 --> 00:49:51.580]   there's a human in the loop that's really fine tuning
[00:49:51.580 --> 00:49:53.940]   at this specific, or maybe I'm very predictable,
[00:49:53.940 --> 00:49:56.980]   but it's very loving in the way I would write a message.
[00:49:56.980 --> 00:49:59.340]   - Well, and so think about that, all right?
[00:49:59.340 --> 00:50:02.020]   So when Phishing First comes out,
[00:50:02.020 --> 00:50:04.100]   you could look at the language of the text
[00:50:04.100 --> 00:50:06.620]   or the website and say, "Eh, if you were paying attention,
[00:50:06.620 --> 00:50:07.860]   "that's so okay."
[00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:09.380]   So that's not an English speaker
[00:50:09.380 --> 00:50:11.300]   who wrote that typically, all right?
[00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:14.340]   But as time has went on, as the awareness
[00:50:14.340 --> 00:50:16.700]   of what a phishing attack looks like,
[00:50:16.700 --> 00:50:18.500]   we have people that are sitting down now
[00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:20.940]   and making sure that the language is proper.
[00:50:20.940 --> 00:50:21.980]   It gets worse than that though,
[00:50:21.980 --> 00:50:24.220]   if you look at business email compromise, all right?
[00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:26.760]   So the way a business email compromise typically works
[00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:31.540]   is the attacker will find a payroll person, find a CEO.
[00:50:31.540 --> 00:50:34.060]   He will fashion a spear phishing email,
[00:50:34.060 --> 00:50:35.860]   which is that's a phishing attack
[00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:38.980]   that's targeting one specific individual, all right?
[00:50:38.980 --> 00:50:40.740]   So he'll fashion a spear phishing email.
[00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:43.820]   And the way he does that is he pulls all the information
[00:50:43.820 --> 00:50:48.820]   he possibly can on that person, all right, that CEO.
[00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:54.220]   Maybe he'll spear that CEO just to get
[00:50:54.220 --> 00:50:57.100]   their login credentials to their email,
[00:50:57.100 --> 00:50:58.140]   just to read the emails.
[00:50:58.140 --> 00:50:59.940]   And he'll go in there and he'll start reading
[00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:01.220]   all these emails.
[00:51:01.220 --> 00:51:02.980]   He'll specifically read the emails
[00:51:02.980 --> 00:51:06.100]   to the payroll department, see what that relationship is.
[00:51:06.100 --> 00:51:07.580]   Are they talking about their kids?
[00:51:07.580 --> 00:51:09.500]   Talking about relationships, talking about vacation.
[00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:10.460]   What are they talking about?
[00:51:10.460 --> 00:51:11.300]   How are they talking?
[00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:12.340]   Are they friendly?
[00:51:12.340 --> 00:51:13.300]   Are they sterile?
[00:51:13.300 --> 00:51:15.060]   What are they doing, all right?
[00:51:15.060 --> 00:51:17.060]   So then he decides, well, I'm gonna go ahead
[00:51:17.060 --> 00:51:20.020]   and spear phish the payroll department as well.
[00:51:20.020 --> 00:51:22.580]   So then he spear phishes them, gets those credentials.
[00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:25.700]   At the same time, he creates a Unicode domain
[00:51:25.700 --> 00:51:27.700]   in whatever the company name is, all right?
[00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:29.740]   So instead of that English alphabet I,
[00:51:29.740 --> 00:51:32.220]   he's got that Russian letter that looks like an I,
[00:51:32.220 --> 00:51:35.220]   but without the dot on top, all right?
[00:51:35.220 --> 00:51:38.340]   Comes back into the email, into the payroll email,
[00:51:38.340 --> 00:51:41.820]   blocks the real CEO's email, replaces that
[00:51:41.820 --> 00:51:44.180]   with the Unicode email that he's got,
[00:51:44.180 --> 00:51:48.900]   and then sends out a message using the correct language,
[00:51:48.900 --> 00:51:51.060]   the correct relationships, everything else,
[00:51:51.060 --> 00:51:53.940]   and says, hey, we're updating our account status.
[00:51:53.940 --> 00:51:57.020]   I need you to send this payment instead of this over here.
[00:51:57.020 --> 00:51:58.100]   They've set up a new account.
[00:51:58.100 --> 00:51:59.820]   Send all payments over here now.
[00:51:59.820 --> 00:52:02.620]   And that is business email compromise in a nutshell,
[00:52:02.620 --> 00:52:04.460]   all right, works great.
[00:52:04.460 --> 00:52:06.580]   - Probably the larger the organization,
[00:52:06.580 --> 00:52:10.140]   the more susceptible to that kind of attack,
[00:52:10.140 --> 00:52:14.820]   'cause there's a distribution of responsibility
[00:52:14.820 --> 00:52:16.860]   to where you're more likely to believe that,
[00:52:16.860 --> 00:52:18.980]   okay, this other person is responsible.
[00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:21.020]   I'm sure they secured everything.
[00:52:21.020 --> 00:52:21.940]   - Absolutely.
[00:52:21.940 --> 00:52:23.340]   - I'm okay listening to this.
[00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:25.940]   - So that's business email compromise,
[00:52:25.940 --> 00:52:27.780]   and those crimes, and that's one of the things
[00:52:27.780 --> 00:52:28.820]   you see about cybercrime.
[00:52:28.820 --> 00:52:30.820]   Cybercrime's not really sophisticated.
[00:52:30.820 --> 00:52:32.860]   It's not, the attacks are not sophisticated.
[00:52:32.860 --> 00:52:37.860]   The stat is 90% of every single attack uses a known exploit.
[00:52:37.860 --> 00:52:41.100]   It's not zero-day attacks.
[00:52:41.100 --> 00:52:43.060]   They're out there, but if you're a criminal
[00:52:43.060 --> 00:52:44.380]   waiting on a zero-day to profit,
[00:52:44.380 --> 00:52:46.220]   you're gonna starve to death.
[00:52:46.220 --> 00:52:51.220]   The meat and potatoes are that 90%, known exploits.
[00:52:51.220 --> 00:52:54.860]   - And then the rest is, well, you're saying it's,
[00:52:54.860 --> 00:52:57.620]   maybe you mean it's not technically sophisticated,
[00:52:57.620 --> 00:52:59.900]   but it's social engineering sophisticated.
[00:52:59.900 --> 00:53:02.380]   - Very sophisticated on that end, very sophisticated.
[00:53:02.380 --> 00:53:04.420]   - It's a fascinating study of human psychology.
[00:53:04.420 --> 00:53:05.860]   - That establishment of trust,
[00:53:05.860 --> 00:53:09.420]   and then using that trust to defraud that victim.
[00:53:09.420 --> 00:53:11.260]   That is something.
[00:53:11.260 --> 00:53:14.340]   - I wish, obviously, all of these folks
[00:53:14.340 --> 00:53:16.700]   are really good at hiding.
[00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:19.420]   I wish you could tell their stories in a way,
[00:53:19.420 --> 00:53:20.980]   which is why you're fascinating,
[00:53:20.980 --> 00:53:22.780]   is you're able to tell these stories now,
[00:53:22.780 --> 00:53:26.980]   'cause it is studying human nature
[00:53:26.980 --> 00:53:29.420]   by exploiting it, but you get to understand
[00:53:29.420 --> 00:53:34.420]   our weak points, our hope, our desire to trust others.
[00:53:34.420 --> 00:53:40.780]   Also, sort of the weak points
[00:53:40.780 --> 00:53:42.860]   and the failures of digital systems
[00:53:42.860 --> 00:53:46.020]   and at scale humans have to connect.
[00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:46.900]   It's fascinating.
[00:53:46.900 --> 00:53:50.900]   It's a weird question, asking for a friend.
[00:53:50.900 --> 00:53:54.860]   Is spear phishing itself illegal?
[00:53:54.860 --> 00:53:56.260]   What's the legality here?
[00:53:56.260 --> 00:53:57.180]   - Well, it's all illegal.
[00:53:57.180 --> 00:53:58.220]   Absolutely it is.
[00:53:58.220 --> 00:53:59.180]   - Is it absolutely?
[00:53:59.180 --> 00:54:02.460]   So here's what, okay, let me construct an example.
[00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:08.500]   So if my friend were to spear phish a CEO, right,
[00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:14.580]   and get their information, and after they get control,
[00:54:14.580 --> 00:54:16.220]   say of their Twitter account,
[00:54:16.220 --> 00:54:21.220]   they tweet something loving and positive, what's the crime?
[00:54:21.220 --> 00:54:23.700]   - Unauthorized access of advice.
[00:54:23.700 --> 00:54:25.200]   - What will be the punishment?
[00:54:26.040 --> 00:54:27.600]   Do you think?
[00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:29.120]   - That becomes questionable.
[00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:33.000]   So no monetary loss, or was there a monetary loss?
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:34.760]   Probably not, all right?
[00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:37.160]   So you have to figure out who the victim is
[00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:38.200]   before charges are pressed.
[00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:42.160]   Now, the crime would be unauthorized access, all right?
[00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:47.080]   But no real victim on that, unless the person
[00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:50.840]   whose account you took over takes exception to that.
[00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:53.120]   No monetary loss.
[00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:55.120]   - So there's not really standard, like, fines?
[00:54:55.120 --> 00:54:56.280]   - Probably nothing's gonna happen.
[00:54:56.280 --> 00:54:57.400]   - Right, right, right.
[00:54:57.400 --> 00:54:59.920]   So I mean, that's kind of interesting,
[00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:04.280]   'cause it's, so when I got the ransomware,
[00:55:04.280 --> 00:55:07.700]   when I got the zero-day attack on the QNAP mass,
[00:55:07.700 --> 00:55:13.600]   you know, they basically say the criminal
[00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:17.560]   is QNAP, the company,
[00:55:17.560 --> 00:55:20.460]   for having so many security vulnerabilities.
[00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:26.280]   Like, you are the victim of QNAP's incompetence.
[00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:27.880]   That's the way they kind of phrase it.
[00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:30.120]   - And see, I don't agree with that.
[00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:31.920]   I don't agree with that at all.
[00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:33.740]   So, SolarWinds.
[00:55:33.740 --> 00:55:36.400]   (both laughing)
[00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:41.200]   So I've got 130-page class-action lawsuit
[00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:43.120]   printed out at the house, I've been going through it,
[00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:47.200]   that catalogs how SolarWinds lied for years
[00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:49.760]   about their vulnerabilities, and they lied to investors.
[00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:53.480]   The people who came in, the auditors who they would hire,
[00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:57.040]   they would not pay attention to them
[00:55:57.040 --> 00:55:58.580]   when they said, "You've got these issues,"
[00:55:58.580 --> 00:56:00.320]   they would say, "Go away."
[00:56:00.320 --> 00:56:03.040]   Shit like that for years, until SolarWinds,
[00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:04.880]   the attacks become apparent.
[00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:10.960]   My view on that is that the only person
[00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:14.040]   responsible for the crime are the criminals
[00:56:14.040 --> 00:56:16.520]   who did the attacking, the actual criminals,
[00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:18.000]   not SolarWinds.
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:21.360]   Now, does that mean that SolarWinds isn't all fucked up?
[00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:25.540]   They are, and there needs to be some accounting in place.
[00:56:25.540 --> 00:56:29.380]   But the only individual, the only people responsible
[00:56:29.380 --> 00:56:33.640]   for crime are the criminals, and that's either online,
[00:56:33.640 --> 00:56:35.480]   in the physical world, what have you.
[00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:39.900]   Being an idiot is not a crime.
[00:56:39.900 --> 00:56:43.120]   (both laughing)
[00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:45.200]   Being criminally negligent is,
[00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:48.640]   and I think that SolarWinds is certainly responsible,
[00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:52.280]   not responsible, they're culpable for what happened.
[00:56:52.280 --> 00:56:55.400]   - Can you actually tell folks about SolarWinds?
[00:56:55.400 --> 00:56:56.240]   What is it?
[00:56:56.240 --> 00:57:00.640]   What are some interesting things that you're aware of?
[00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:05.640]   - SolarWinds was very, it provided a backbone of security
[00:57:05.640 --> 00:57:10.800]   for hundreds, thousands of different companies.
[00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:14.480]   If you looked at a lot of security companies
[00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:16.400]   were using SolarWinds, that would allow you
[00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:19.080]   to get a snapshot of the entire system
[00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:20.440]   that they were working on.
[00:57:20.440 --> 00:57:23.040]   So what happens is, is you get a Russian group
[00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:27.800]   that comes in and they, basically,
[00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:30.640]   they hack into SolarWinds and get access to it,
[00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:34.640]   and it allows them to view every single thing,
[00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:39.400]   I mean every single thing, about every single client
[00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:43.040]   that SolarWinds had at that point.
[00:57:43.040 --> 00:57:46.880]   So entire snapshots of all the IP that was going on,
[00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:48.800]   all the emails, all the communications,
[00:57:48.800 --> 00:57:51.780]   every single secret that was going on with those companies.
[00:57:51.780 --> 00:57:54.440]   If a company had software like Microsoft,
[00:57:54.440 --> 00:57:56.560]   it allowed them to look at the source code
[00:57:56.560 --> 00:57:58.000]   of everything that was going on.
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:01.440]   I mean, it's just a complete and total nightmare,
[00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:03.920]   all right, and something that you are not
[00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:06.740]   going to recover from.
[00:58:06.740 --> 00:58:08.040]   You're not.
[00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:09.800]   I mean, it's done at that point.
[00:58:10.760 --> 00:58:13.520]   You know, there's not been a lot of news lately about it,
[00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:16.080]   but the fact of the matter is, is that's the type of attack
[00:58:16.080 --> 00:58:17.920]   that's a catastrophic attack.
[00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:20.960]   - So there's a huge amount of information
[00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:23.720]   that was read, saved elsewhere, probably.
[00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:24.560]   - Oh yeah.
[00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:27.280]   - And so now, there's people sitting on information.
[00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:28.100]   - Absolutely.
[00:58:28.100 --> 00:58:29.520]   So think about one of the attack vectors
[00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:33.800]   has been Microsoft Outlook 365, things like that.
[00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:35.340]   This allowed the attackers to look
[00:58:35.340 --> 00:58:37.360]   at the source codes of that.
[00:58:37.360 --> 00:58:39.260]   So they have the source code now,
[00:58:39.260 --> 00:58:41.560]   so they go through it line by line.
[00:58:41.560 --> 00:58:42.600]   What are the vulnerabilities?
[00:58:42.600 --> 00:58:44.640]   Let's find new vulnerabilities, new zero days.
[00:58:44.640 --> 00:58:46.560]   I said zero days aren't common,
[00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:49.040]   but this opens up an entire new threat surface
[00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:50.020]   all of a sudden.
[00:58:50.020 --> 00:58:52.520]   So it's a completely catastrophic attack.
[00:58:52.520 --> 00:58:54.840]   Once all the chips are down, everything's tallied up,
[00:58:54.840 --> 00:58:57.320]   people are gonna be like, yeah, we're done, we're done.
[00:58:57.320 --> 00:58:58.160]   - Yeah.
[00:58:58.160 --> 00:59:00.400]   (laughing)
[00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:03.280]   All right, this whole computer thing, we tried it.
[00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:04.120]   - We're done.
[00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:04.960]   - We're walking away.
[00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:05.800]   - We're done.
[00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:08.280]   - That's terrifying, so you're saying
[00:59:08.280 --> 00:59:12.680]   that there's not been obvious, big,
[00:59:12.680 --> 00:59:15.400]   negative impact from that yet.
[00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:16.920]   - There's been a lot of negative impact,
[00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:18.300]   but we're just starting.
[00:59:18.300 --> 00:59:22.520]   - Right, so the capacity for destruction is huge here.
[00:59:22.520 --> 00:59:24.640]   How much involvement from nation states
[00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:26.640]   do you think there is on this?
[00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:28.140]   - You know, it's interesting.
[00:59:28.140 --> 00:59:32.440]   So you've got Iran, you've got North Korea, China, Russia,
[00:59:32.440 --> 00:59:35.520]   you got the big four, you also got Brazil.
[00:59:35.520 --> 00:59:36.680]   You've got all these other countries
[00:59:36.680 --> 00:59:39.140]   that are interested in the United States as well.
[00:59:39.140 --> 00:59:42.120]   Nation states are interesting
[00:59:42.120 --> 00:59:44.460]   depending on who the nation state is.
[00:59:44.460 --> 00:59:46.240]   All right, so Russia's very good about working
[00:59:46.240 --> 00:59:48.260]   with the type of criminal that I used to be.
[00:59:48.260 --> 00:59:49.980]   You know, they'll enlist these guys
[00:59:49.980 --> 00:59:51.880]   and steal information or what have you,
[00:59:51.880 --> 00:59:54.080]   then Russia will take the information they want to,
[00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:55.920]   and they'll basically go off and sell
[00:59:55.920 --> 00:59:58.280]   whatever you want to and make some money.
[00:59:58.280 --> 01:00:00.320]   China's all about IP.
[01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:02.520]   North Korea's about stealing money
[01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:03.720]   because they really don't know
[01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:05.760]   what the hell else to do right now.
[01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:07.200]   But--
[01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:09.480]   - So North Korea is actively involved in cybercrime.
[01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:11.360]   - Absolutely, they've stolen a shitload
[01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:13.320]   of Bitcoin and everything else.
[01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:15.760]   So absolutely they're actively involved with that.
[01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:19.120]   Very skilled attackers, very skilled.
[01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:20.160]   But even if you look at, you know,
[01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:23.540]   I told you that stat about 90%, all right?
[01:00:23.540 --> 01:00:25.920]   So even though SolarWinds is gonna be
[01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:29.320]   the number one attack,
[01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:34.040]   the follow-up to that is this NotPetya attack that happened.
[01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:36.600]   And so that was the most sophisticated attack
[01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:39.000]   launched by the Russian Sandworm Group
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.680]   using all known exploits throughout.
[01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:43.720]   So it's not, again, it's not,
[01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:46.080]   you're right in the sophistication
[01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:48.620]   is typically not technical sophistication,
[01:00:48.620 --> 01:00:50.840]   but it's that social engineering sophistication.
[01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:53.480]   How do you get these things put together in line
[01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:55.080]   to attack and succeed?
[01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:58.080]   - But when you get access to the source code,
[01:00:58.080 --> 01:00:59.560]   that's where technical sophistication
[01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:01.120]   could really do a lot of damage.
[01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:03.420]   - And that's when you find out real quick,
[01:01:03.420 --> 01:01:06.120]   that's what separates the men from the boys in this game.
[01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:07.800]   All right, because all of a sudden it's not,
[01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:09.640]   I don't have to worry about social engineering.
[01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:12.440]   I've got source codes and I've got professionals
[01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:15.180]   that are looking at that, and that's your ass.
[01:01:15.180 --> 01:01:19.000]   - Which then enables probably even more powerful
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.820]   social engineering methods too.
[01:01:20.820 --> 01:01:22.720]   I mean, it's just a cascade of...
[01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:27.600]   Is this terrifying to you, by the way?
[01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:30.360]   That this world that we're living in,
[01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:35.300]   as we put more and more of ourselves on the internet,
[01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:39.300]   into the metaverse, that there's so many more
[01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:41.300]   attack vectors on our well-being.
[01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:43.460]   - What's terrifying to me,
[01:01:43.460 --> 01:01:45.820]   I used to preach it on Shadow Crew,
[01:01:45.820 --> 01:01:50.220]   is the idea that the perception of truth
[01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:52.900]   is more important than the truth itself.
[01:01:52.900 --> 01:01:54.500]   It doesn't matter what the facts are,
[01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:57.140]   it matters what I can convince you of.
[01:01:57.140 --> 01:01:59.220]   That's what's terrifying to me.
[01:01:59.220 --> 01:02:02.540]   So you look at deep fakes, you look at fake news,
[01:02:02.540 --> 01:02:04.280]   all the stuff that's going out,
[01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:06.500]   that becomes truly terrifying.
[01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:12.480]   - Maybe there's an angle where it's freeing,
[01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:16.320]   if nothing is true and you can't trust anything.
[01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:18.480]   (laughing)
[01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:21.160]   - You see, we as human beings, we wanna trust.
[01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:23.320]   We do, we need human interaction,
[01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:25.440]   and for that human interaction,
[01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:27.480]   you have to have a degree of trust.
[01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:32.400]   But it's more like you let go of an idea of absolute truth,
[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:36.160]   and it more becomes like a blockchain-style consensus.
[01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:38.800]   So you let go of like, you know what,
[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:43.240]   there's this human dream, you get this on the internet,
[01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:47.520]   you get facts, as if there's at the bottom,
[01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:49.040]   at the bottom there's one turtle
[01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:52.120]   that's holding this scroll that says,
[01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:54.400]   "These are the truths of the world."
[01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:58.120]   The problem is, I mean, maybe believing that
[01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:01.640]   is counterproductive, maybe human civilization
[01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:05.080]   is an ongoing process of consensus.
[01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:08.740]   And so it's always going to be, everything is shrouded,
[01:03:08.740 --> 01:03:11.440]   and you can call them lies, or you can call them inaccuracies,
[01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:14.160]   or you can call them delusions.
[01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:15.400]   It's constantly going to be,
[01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:19.620]   it's going to be a sea of lies and delusions.
[01:03:19.620 --> 01:03:22.320]   But our hope is to, over time,
[01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:24.760]   develop bigger and bigger islands of consensus
[01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:27.800]   that allows us to live a stable and happy society.
[01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:29.280]   Don't call it true.
[01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:34.000]   Call it a stable consensus that creates
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.000]   a high quality of life for the inhabitants of the island.
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.640]   - I like it, I mean, I like it.
[01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:40.520]   I mean, that's, we're going to agree on this.
[01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:43.360]   - And then don't use outlines, no, I'm just kidding.
[01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:45.840]   So maybe a step back, you mentioned,
[01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:48.520]   I'd love to talk about ShadowCube,
[01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:50.080]   maybe this is the right time to actually,
[01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:51.440]   yeah, let's go to ShadowCube,
[01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:53.040]   'cause it's such a fascinating story.
[01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:54.720]   So tell me the story of building ShadowCube,
[01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:59.800]   the precursor to today's Darknet and Darknet markets.
[01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:02.960]   This is why you're the original godfather.
[01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:04.600]   - This is it, this is it.
[01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:06.640]   So I get married.
[01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:09.140]   I faked a car accident to get married,
[01:04:09.140 --> 01:04:10.160]   got the money from that.
[01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:11.120]   - You're romantic.
[01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:13.320]   - I'm romantic, like my dad, man.
[01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:16.720]   I'm the guy that, from mom, I get the criminal mindset,
[01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:19.640]   from dad, I get that, don't want him to leave.
[01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:22.520]   (laughing)
[01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:23.620]   - So you get married.
[01:04:23.620 --> 01:04:26.360]   - I met this girl. - What's that story?
[01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:28.200]   - Oh, dude, I was--
[01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:29.720]   - How did you fall in love there?
[01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:32.120]   - My first girlfriend was a preacher's daughter,
[01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:35.280]   and crazy over her, dated her for five years,
[01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:38.720]   and she figured out pretty quickly that,
[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:40.920]   well, not quickly, it took her five years to figure out
[01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:43.080]   that Brett Johnson is not the man of God.
[01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:44.840]   (laughing)
[01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:50.160]   I could talk it, but more that agnostic than anything,
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:52.360]   she breaks up with me.
[01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:54.920]   So I was at the community college.
[01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:56.600]   - You'd make one hell of a preacher, by the way.
[01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:57.440]   - Thank you.
[01:04:57.440 --> 01:04:59.720]   (laughing)
[01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:00.560]   Yeah.
[01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:04.080]   Yeah, I've got that Langston Hughes problem.
[01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:06.720]   I'm looking for Jesus to show up, and he just doesn't.
[01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:09.000]   (laughing)
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.520]   So I was at the community college,
[01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:12.040]   and I was a straight asshole.
[01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:14.520]   I was arrogant, conceited, everything else.
[01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:18.800]   And I had posted an advertisement on one of the billboards
[01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:21.880]   looking for an adult babysitter, hot, blonde,
[01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:24.120]   come visit me in the library.
[01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:26.320]   Buddy of mine shows up, and he's like, "Brett."
[01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:27.640]   And I was like, "Yeah."
[01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:29.960]   He's like, "Hottest girl in school, right down the hall."
[01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:31.040]   And I was like, "Serious?"
[01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:31.880]   He's like, "Yeah."
[01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:32.960]   And I was like, "Let's go see."
[01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:34.280]   (laughing)
[01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:36.080]   Walk over, and there's these two guys
[01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:37.440]   that are hitting on her.
[01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:40.840]   So I just walk up, and me and Todd, that was my buddy,
[01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:43.440]   walk up, and I'm just sitting there and listening,
[01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:45.240]   and they're giving the spill and everything,
[01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:46.680]   and she's just kind of taken down.
[01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:48.800]   Finally, I looked over, and I was like,
[01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:50.640]   "You wanna get out of here?"
[01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:53.320]   And one of the guys looks at me, he's like,
[01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:54.160]   "Hey, we're talking to her."
[01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:55.800]   And I was like, "Well, you're talking at her.
[01:05:55.800 --> 01:05:57.040]   "You're not talking to her.
[01:05:57.040 --> 01:05:59.400]   "I'm about to save her ass from you."
[01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:01.280]   - Damn, that's a smooth pickup line, by the way,
[01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:02.120]   if I've ever heard one.
[01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:02.960]   That's good.
[01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:04.200]   You wanna get out of here?
[01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:08.560]   - So start dating, and she was the girl
[01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:10.960]   that screwed my brains out, man.
[01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:13.160]   And I fell, I head over heels.
[01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:16.000]   We got married six months later, six months.
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.040]   - That's what love does.
[01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:18.240]   - That's what it does.
[01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:22.800]   And I had, she didn't know I was a crook.
[01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:24.280]   She had no idea.
[01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:26.240]   You know, she knew I was very bright.
[01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:28.740]   She knew I did a lot of theater, stuff like that.
[01:06:28.740 --> 01:06:32.800]   Got a job at, I was in Hazard.
[01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:35.800]   There was no jobs to be had, so I got a job in Lexington,
[01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:38.520]   'cause we were gonna be moving to UK.
[01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:43.240]   Got a job in Lexington at Lexmark testing printer boards,
[01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:44.360]   circuit boards.
[01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:46.920]   So I would leave on a Thursday night,
[01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:50.520]   work three 18-hour shifts at Lexmark,
[01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:52.100]   come back home on Monday.
[01:06:52.100 --> 01:06:58.000]   Got married, faked a car accident to get the rest
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.240]   of the money that I needed to get married.
[01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:07.160]   And the faking on that, man, I had bought a Chevy Spectrum
[01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:09.800]   at a car auction, gave like 500 bucks for it.
[01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:14.000]   My aunt had previously defrauded USAA insurance
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:15.080]   on a car accident.
[01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:16.320]   And she was telling me all about it.
[01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:18.720]   She's like, "Look, go down to this chiropractor,
[01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:20.200]   "make sure you get the insurance where they'll pay
[01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:22.480]   "for a rental car, they'll pay lost wages."
[01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:24.120]   I was like, "They pay lost wages?"
[01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:25.760]   She's like, "Yeah, they pay lost wages."
[01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:26.960]   I was like, "Hmm."
[01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:29.120]   She's like, "By the way, you work for me."
[01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:30.360]   And I was like, "I work for you."
[01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:31.200]   So.
[01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:34.360]   - And you get to define the wage,
[01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:37.160]   and you can also define how long you were unable to work.
[01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:38.400]   - Exactly, exactly.
[01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:40.480]   And the chiropractor will sign off on any damn thing.
[01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:45.200]   All right, so my cousin, Ronnie, he figures out
[01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:47.000]   that I'm going, he finds out I'm gonna fake
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:47.840]   this car accident.
[01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:49.720]   So he comes to me, he's like, "Hey man, can I get in on that?"
[01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:51.460]   I was like, "Yeah, man, you get in on that."
[01:07:51.460 --> 01:07:54.000]   So this kid, he's five days younger than I am.
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:55.800]   This kid, he goes to the dentist the day
[01:07:55.800 --> 01:07:58.240]   that we're faking it, has a tooth pulled,
[01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:01.080]   tells the dentist not to numb it, not to stitch it,
[01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:01.920]   just pull it.
[01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:02.760]   (laughs)
[01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:06.240]   So he shows up, he shows up the day that we're driving
[01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:08.400]   out to fake the accident, he's got blood all over his shirt,
[01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:09.960]   he's still bleeding out of the mouth and everything else.
[01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:10.800]   I'm like, "Are you okay?"
[01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:12.160]   And he's like, "Yeah, man, it's gonna be good,
[01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:13.000]   it's gonna be good."
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:13.840]   I'm like, "Okay."
[01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:15.680]   So we, my mom, by this point,
[01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:17.300]   I'm living with my grandparents.
[01:08:17.300 --> 01:08:20.320]   My mom is up in the head of a hollow.
[01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:22.040]   So we're like, "We'll just do it up there.
[01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:23.760]   We'll go act like we're visiting my mom."
[01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:26.120]   On the way back out, ran over a mountain.
[01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:27.280]   I was like, "Okay."
[01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:30.680]   So we go visit and everything, come back out that night,
[01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:32.360]   run over the side of the hill.
[01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:35.880]   Me and Ronnie walk back up, of course it totals the car.
[01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:37.960]   Walk back to my mom's, acting like we've wrecked,
[01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:40.040]   she knows what time it is and everything else,
[01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:41.840]   and file the claims.
[01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:44.440]   So that gets the money to get married.
[01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:48.180]   And me and my wife moved from Hazard to Lexington.
[01:08:48.180 --> 01:08:50.480]   And I'm the kid that,
[01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:57.680]   my crime usually, if I was a single guy,
[01:08:57.680 --> 01:08:59.080]   wouldn't break the law.
[01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:00.560]   Wouldn't, I would be all right, you know?
[01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:03.720]   But females involved, oh yeah, oh yeah.
[01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:05.640]   Gotta spend the money, gotta show 'em gifts,
[01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:07.840]   everything else was never enough to show love
[01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:09.320]   in some sort of healthy way.
[01:09:09.320 --> 01:09:10.520]   Always had to go overboard.
[01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:11.680]   And typically it was buying some,
[01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:13.360]   or stealing some sort of expensive crap.
[01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:17.280]   - So that was the thing, that was the way you show love,
[01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:19.120]   is by buying expensive gifts.
[01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:20.680]   - Or something overboard.
[01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:23.520]   Back then with Susan initially,
[01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:26.600]   it was, "Don't worry about working, I got it.
[01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:27.840]   You just worry about going to school."
[01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:29.520]   She was a music major.
[01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:31.560]   I was like, "You just worry about going to school.
[01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:34.560]   So don't worry about cooking and cleaning, I got it.
[01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:35.400]   I got it."
[01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:37.800]   So not only was I this guy that was going overboard,
[01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:40.240]   but I was kind of a control freak too, right?
[01:09:40.240 --> 01:09:42.260]   So no, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[01:09:42.260 --> 01:09:46.560]   So here I am, you know, 60 hour a week job,
[01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:48.800]   18 hour class load, cooking, cleaning.
[01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:50.360]   Something had to give.
[01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:51.840]   I quit the job, I couldn't do it.
[01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:55.120]   Quit the job and start back in fraud
[01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:57.860]   and trying to hide that from her at the same time.
[01:09:57.860 --> 01:10:00.560]   So it was initially telemarketing fraud.
[01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:03.760]   Started, I was working at,
[01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:07.280]   the first job I had was a telemarketer at a cemetery
[01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:08.880]   selling grave sites.
[01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:11.400]   And then that ended,
[01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:14.440]   went over to work for the Shriners Hospital.
[01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:16.680]   And it was a third party company
[01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:17.800]   that was doing all the telemarketing,
[01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:19.720]   made really good money doing that.
[01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:22.880]   That job ended and then they pivoted over
[01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:25.180]   to working with Kiwanis Clubs,
[01:10:25.180 --> 01:10:29.320]   selling food baskets to the food banks and everything.
[01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:32.480]   So I stole the phone list
[01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:34.880]   and started up my own Kiwanis Club
[01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:36.760]   and would do the telemarketing,
[01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:39.440]   go out twice a week and pick up checks.
[01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:42.760]   Well, what happened was is I'm going out
[01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:46.240]   picking up checks, go knock on a door.
[01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:48.480]   Turns out one of the persons that I had called
[01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:50.800]   was a law enforcement officer.
[01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:52.960]   So he was like, "Who are you?"
[01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:55.400]   I'm like, "I'm with the Kiwanis Club."
[01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:57.000]   And he's like, "No, you're not."
[01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:00.920]   Got arrested, spent three months in a county jail
[01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:03.080]   for theft by deception.
[01:11:03.080 --> 01:11:08.080]   Got out and we had to move from Lexington
[01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:10.920]   back to Hazard and live with Susan's parents.
[01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:15.040]   They had gotten a desktop computer, HP.
[01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:19.880]   And I started surfing around online, found eBay.
[01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:22.760]   And didn't really know how to make money on eBay.
[01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:27.760]   About the same time, I'm committing low-level frauds
[01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:29.040]   online.
[01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:30.960]   I don't really talk about that in the past.
[01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:32.440]   The first time I've really talked about that,
[01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:36.200]   but I would pay for it with bad checks.
[01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:40.680]   - So more a person, so not using a platform like eBay,
[01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:41.520]   more--
[01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:43.680]   - I would find somebody that had like a stereo system
[01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:44.840]   on eBay, something like that,
[01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:46.720]   and I'd pay for it with a bad check
[01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:50.320]   and would rely on them not to chase me
[01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:51.680]   because they were out of state at that point
[01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:53.960]   and the dollar amounts were very low.
[01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:57.440]   So got the money to move to, finally did those schemes
[01:11:57.440 --> 01:12:01.760]   enough to get the money to move back to Lexington.
[01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:04.440]   Got to Lexington and by this point I'm doing these,
[01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:07.160]   like I said, these schemes on eBay.
[01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:09.160]   And I'm like, there's gotta be a better way
[01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:11.000]   to make money on eBay, gotta be.
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:12.560]   So didn't really know how.
[01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:16.520]   One night I'm watching Inside Edition with Bill O'Reilly
[01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:18.880]   and they're profiling Beanie Babies.
[01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:20.760]   So I'm sitting there watching and the one they're profiling
[01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:23.600]   is this one called Peanut the Royal Blue Elephant
[01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:25.800]   selling for $1,500 on eBay.
[01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:27.320]   I'm sitting there going like, shit,
[01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:28.760]   I need to find me a peanut.
[01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:32.640]   My initial thought was, well, there's gotta be one
[01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:35.480]   in one of these Hallmark stores in Kentucky someplace.
[01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:36.880]   So I skipped class the next day,
[01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:39.720]   went out around all the Hallmark stores looking for peanut.
[01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:43.780]   No idiot, he's on eBay for $1,500.
[01:12:43.780 --> 01:12:46.960]   So after a few hours of that, I'm like,
[01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:51.480]   turns out they had a little gray Beanie Baby Elephants
[01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:54.480]   for $8, picked up one of those for $8,
[01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:56.080]   stopped by Kroger on the way home,
[01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:58.400]   picked up a pack of blue Rit dye,
[01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:00.480]   went home, tried to dye the little guy.
[01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:02.600]   So that was a nightmare.
[01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:04.740]   Turns out they're made out of polyester,
[01:13:04.740 --> 01:13:07.640]   get them out of the bath, looks like they've got the mange.
[01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:11.680]   And what happens is, so I'm trying to dye the damn thing.
[01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:13.240]   I'm like, well, that's not gonna work.
[01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:14.620]   That's just not gonna work.
[01:13:14.620 --> 01:13:17.400]   So I got online, found a picture of a real one,
[01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:19.120]   posted it on eBay.
[01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:21.920]   And I was like, well, what I can do is,
[01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:25.520]   I can claim that's the one I've got,
[01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:28.400]   and then maybe claim that it got messed up in the mail
[01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:29.360]   and work out like that.
[01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:32.320]   So posted a picture of a real one online.
[01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:35.600]   Woman thought I had the real thing, she wins the bid.
[01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:37.520]   That social engineering kicks in immediately.
[01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:39.520]   I didn't want to be on the defensive,
[01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:41.400]   I wanted to put her on the defensive.
[01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:44.040]   So as soon as she wins the bid, I send her a message.
[01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:46.160]   Hey, we've not done any business before.
[01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:47.800]   I don't even know if I can trust you.
[01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:50.680]   What I need you to do, protects us both,
[01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:52.280]   go down to the US Postal Service,
[01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:54.980]   get two money orders totaling $1,500,
[01:13:54.980 --> 01:13:57.560]   send them to me, issued by the US government,
[01:13:57.560 --> 01:13:59.060]   that way we're both protected.
[01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:02.600]   Soon as I get the money orders, I'll send you your animal.
[01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:04.720]   She believed that, didn't ask any questions at all.
[01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:05.680]   She believed that.
[01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:09.680]   Sent me the money orders, I cashed them out.
[01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:12.640]   Sent her the creature, immediately got a phone call.
[01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:13.880]   I didn't order this.
[01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:16.840]   My response, lady, you ordered a blue elephant.
[01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:19.840]   I sent you a blue-ish elephant.
[01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:23.040]   And she got pissed, and she kept calling.
[01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:26.160]   What I found out, and that's really the first lesson
[01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:27.680]   of cybercrime that most of these criminals,
[01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:29.160]   including self, learns.
[01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:30.720]   If you delay a victim long enough,
[01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:32.760]   just keep putting them off, a lot of them,
[01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:34.600]   they get exasperated, throw their hands in the air,
[01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:36.720]   walk away, you don't hear from them.
[01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:39.600]   And none of them, to this day,
[01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:41.480]   none of them complain to law enforcement.
[01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:42.800]   They eat it.
[01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:46.480]   - So it's a mixture of like you're exhausted
[01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:49.480]   by the process, so it's just easier to walk away,
[01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:52.160]   and second, almost like an embarrassment.
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:54.560]   - So there's a whole slew of reasons, all right?
[01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:56.760]   There's the exhaustion, certainly.
[01:14:56.760 --> 01:14:58.640]   There's the embarrassment, so if you figure out,
[01:14:58.640 --> 01:14:59.680]   if you look at it today,
[01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:00.960]   where does the embarrassment come from?
[01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:03.560]   Well, the media, family members,
[01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:06.520]   we're all very good about blaming the victim for crimes.
[01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:07.600]   Why would you click on the link?
[01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:09.280]   Why would you send money to somebody you don't know?
[01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:10.240]   Blah, blah, blah.
[01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:12.240]   So you've got that that's going on.
[01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:15.720]   You've got the issue of who do you complain to?
[01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:17.000]   Back then, you didn't know.
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:18.160]   Do you complain to local police?
[01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:20.000]   Because she's in another state,
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.600]   so which local police do you complain to?
[01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:23.600]   Do you complain to the feds?
[01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:25.400]   Well, the dollar amounts aren't high enough
[01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:26.440]   to complain to feds.
[01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:28.120]   Feds are gonna tell you to go local.
[01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:30.720]   Local's gonna tell you, hey, it happened in Kentucky.
[01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:31.600]   Complain to them.
[01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:34.080]   Kentucky's gonna tell you, well, shit, you're over there.
[01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:34.920]   We need you to come in.
[01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:38.320]   So there's this whole issue of the jurisdiction,
[01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:40.500]   of the blame factor, everything else.
[01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:43.320]   So I got away with that crime,
[01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:46.040]   and did it under my own name at that point.
[01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:49.440]   I kept going and got better at it.
[01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:51.760]   Started to understand how to hide identities,
[01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:52.600]   things like that.
[01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:54.760]   Started selling pirated software.
[01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:57.400]   Pirated software led into installing mod chips.
[01:15:57.400 --> 01:15:59.280]   It was for, the initial pirated software
[01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:02.040]   was a Sega Saturn, PlayStation 1.
[01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:03.800]   Well, you had to have a mod chip in those
[01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:05.440]   to play the pirated discs,
[01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:08.760]   so I started selling and installing mod chips.
[01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:10.720]   That led into installing mod chips
[01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:12.280]   into cable television boxes,
[01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:13.800]   so you could watch all the pay-per-view,
[01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:18.160]   which in turn led into programming satellite DSS cards.
[01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:20.880]   Those ATNH RCA satellite systems,
[01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:22.640]   pull the card out of it, program it,
[01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:24.560]   turns on all the channels.
[01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:25.880]   Started doing that.
[01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:27.280]   Can we just pause?
[01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:32.880]   That is very entrepreneurial.
[01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:35.980]   So just technically,
[01:16:35.980 --> 01:16:42.040]   so there's laws and rules that you're breaking,
[01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:43.320]   nonstop.
[01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:47.280]   So there's also legitimate ways of doing that,
[01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:49.960]   which is break the rules of the conventions of the past.
[01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:51.400]   That's the first principles thing.
[01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:55.440]   That's what Elon Musk and his ilk do all the time.
[01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:59.580]   That is guts and brilliance,
[01:16:59.580 --> 01:17:03.100]   but when it's crossing the lines of the law,
[01:17:03.100 --> 01:17:07.300]   actually sometimes the law is outdated.
[01:17:07.300 --> 01:17:09.040]   The thing is, as a human being,
[01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:12.760]   you have to then compute the ethical damage you're doing.
[01:17:12.760 --> 01:17:14.240]   Like ethically, the damage you're doing
[01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:15.220]   about other human beings.
[01:17:15.220 --> 01:17:18.040]   That is fundamentally the thing that you're breaking,
[01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:20.960]   is you're adding to the suffering in the world
[01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:24.240]   in one way or another, and you're justifying it.
[01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:27.800]   But in terms of me, sort of as an engineer,
[01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:29.460]   that is some gutsy thinking.
[01:17:29.460 --> 01:17:33.080]   That's how Woz and Steve Jobs thought.
[01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:35.680]   That's innovation.
[01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:37.800]   And maybe just think,
[01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:41.840]   if you can introspect your thinking process here,
[01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:46.540]   this is a new, I like how you remember this in HP.
[01:17:46.540 --> 01:17:50.180]   Like what, this is a totally new thing to you.
[01:17:50.180 --> 01:17:53.640]   Computers is another domain.
[01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:56.040]   How were you figuring these puzzles out,
[01:17:56.040 --> 01:17:58.320]   presumably mostly alone?
[01:17:58.320 --> 01:17:59.160]   - Alone.
[01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:01.360]   - When you were thinking through these problems,
[01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:04.760]   is there, this is a strange question to ask,
[01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:08.680]   but what is your thinking process?
[01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:10.760]   What is your approach to solving these problems?
[01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:14.200]   - So the approach is, is you do something,
[01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:16.340]   and you fuck it up, and you're like,
[01:18:16.340 --> 01:18:18.440]   you think back, okay, how do I fix that?
[01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:19.760]   (laughing)
[01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:23.840]   So you fix that aspect, you commit the crime again,
[01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:26.720]   and it goes a little bit further, and it screws up.
[01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:28.640]   Okay, how do I fix that?
[01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:29.560]   What's the issue on that?
[01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:30.380]   How do I fix that?
[01:18:30.380 --> 01:18:32.920]   - So there's not a deep design thinking like--
[01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:33.960]   - Later on, it becomes that.
[01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:36.280]   Once you lay that groundwork
[01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:38.280]   of the way these schemes are working,
[01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:41.520]   it becomes that, and you can apply that to other things
[01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:44.480]   in cybercrime as a whole.
[01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:47.440]   But initially, it's basically trial and error.
[01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:50.880]   You've got a problem, how do you solve that problem?
[01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:54.440]   So how do I, I'm committing these crimes under my name,
[01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:55.440]   how do I solve that?
[01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:57.960]   Well, one of the first principles
[01:18:57.960 --> 01:19:00.280]   that we started to teach on Shadow Crew is,
[01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:04.000]   all crimes should begin with identity theft.
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.720]   That's one of the main first principles
[01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:08.280]   that a lot of people to this day still don't really get.
[01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:10.280]   All right, why would I commit a crime under my name
[01:19:10.280 --> 01:19:12.160]   if I can do it under your name?
[01:19:12.160 --> 01:19:13.880]   So that's one of the big buffers,
[01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:15.880]   and that takes trial and error to get to that point
[01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:17.960]   where you start to understand that's the way
[01:19:17.960 --> 01:19:20.660]   crime should operate if you're a criminal.
[01:19:20.660 --> 01:19:25.040]   All right, but with me, it was, I mean, it's trial and error,
[01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:28.200]   it's that childhood where that mindset
[01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:30.080]   is kind of ingrained in you,
[01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:32.400]   where you're looking for ways,
[01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:36.560]   let's say non-traditional ways of getting around things
[01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:37.880]   or getting through things.
[01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:39.640]   - I mean, one of the questions,
[01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:43.600]   probably ask this later, is there's also a unique aspect
[01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:45.240]   to the outcome of what you were doing,
[01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:48.320]   which is you weren't, you didn't get caught
[01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:49.760]   for a very long time.
[01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:50.600]   - Right.
[01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:52.040]   - We'll talk about why that is.
[01:19:52.040 --> 01:19:54.120]   And the thing is, it's so interesting,
[01:19:54.120 --> 01:19:59.200]   all crime probably should, to be effective,
[01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:01.400]   should start with identity theft.
[01:20:01.400 --> 01:20:02.800]   I like that, identity theft,
[01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:05.240]   'cause identity theft can take so many forms.
[01:20:05.240 --> 01:20:06.920]   - Right, right.
[01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:08.940]   - So yes, so Shadow Crew.
[01:20:08.940 --> 01:20:13.240]   You started with love.
[01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:17.220]   - Started with love, so now we're doing these schemes online.
[01:20:17.220 --> 01:20:20.280]   I'm selling to these,
[01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:22.040]   I'm programming these satellite DSS cards,
[01:20:22.040 --> 01:20:24.200]   and one of the interesting things,
[01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:26.040]   and you still see that to this day,
[01:20:26.040 --> 01:20:29.120]   is something will happen
[01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:33.480]   that will create an industry for criminals, all right?
[01:20:33.480 --> 01:20:37.440]   So what happened is, Canada, Canadian judge,
[01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:38.480]   rules about the same time
[01:20:38.480 --> 01:20:40.580]   that I'm doing these satellite cards,
[01:20:40.580 --> 01:20:42.000]   Canadian judge comes out and says,
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:47.000]   "Hey, it's legal for my citizens to pirate those signals."
[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.240]   And his reasoning was,
[01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:51.520]   since RCA doesn't sell the systems up here,
[01:20:51.520 --> 01:20:53.960]   my citizens can pirate it.
[01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:57.480]   Okay, so what happens is, is overnight,
[01:20:57.480 --> 01:20:59.720]   about the same time PayPal comes into play.
[01:20:59.720 --> 01:21:03.320]   So PayPal's coming right online at about the same time.
[01:21:03.320 --> 01:21:05.440]   Overnight, little cottage industry
[01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:07.280]   pops up in the United States.
[01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:09.420]   You go down to Best Buy, buy the system for $100,
[01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:11.380]   take it out in the parking lot, open system up,
[01:21:11.380 --> 01:21:13.040]   pull it, open box up, pull the system out,
[01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:14.720]   pull the card out, throw the system away,
[01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:17.880]   program the card, ship its ass to Canada, $500 a pop.
[01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:21.520]   Started doing that, business is good.
[01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:23.760]   Making, you know, three, $4,000 a week doing that.
[01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:25.160]   I'm like, yeah, that's good.
[01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:28.960]   Have so many orders, I can't fill all the orders.
[01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:30.540]   And quickly think to myself,
[01:21:30.540 --> 01:21:33.720]   why do I need to fill any of them?
[01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:35.960]   They're in Canada, I'm down here.
[01:21:35.960 --> 01:21:37.160]   (laughing)
[01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:39.140]   You know, who are they gonna complain to?
[01:21:39.140 --> 01:21:42.620]   Because I already found out, people don't complain.
[01:21:42.620 --> 01:21:45.160]   All right, they're not gonna complain to anybody.
[01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:46.000]   So I start--
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:46.840]   - Especially in Canada.
[01:21:46.840 --> 01:21:47.960]   - Especially in Canada.
[01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:49.000]   (laughing)
[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:50.640]   And I'm having them send money,
[01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:53.040]   that's when PayPal's first into play.
[01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:58.040]   And it amazes me that everybody is using PayPal.
[01:21:58.040 --> 01:22:00.440]   It's like, you don't even have to really ask.
[01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:01.460]   They're like, can we pay by,
[01:22:01.460 --> 01:22:03.320]   yeah, you can pay all day long by PayPal.
[01:22:03.320 --> 01:22:05.920]   And PayPal had no clue what they were doing with security.
[01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:08.360]   So it's like, okay.
[01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:09.880]   So they're sending money to PayPal,
[01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:13.360]   I'm having the PayPal cashed out to bank accounts
[01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:14.720]   in my name at that point.
[01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:17.480]   And I get scared, because by that point,
[01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:20.160]   I'm still in four to $6,000 a week.
[01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:21.520]   And I'm like, somebody's gonna be looking
[01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:22.520]   at money laundering.
[01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:25.480]   So, get it in my head, I'm like,
[01:22:25.480 --> 01:22:28.960]   best thing that I can do is get a fake driver's license.
[01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:31.240]   Open up a bank account using that driver's license,
[01:22:31.240 --> 01:22:33.320]   cash out at the ATM.
[01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:36.560]   Good, no idea where to get a fake ID, not a clue.
[01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:38.720]   So I get online, looked around,
[01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:40.360]   spent a couple weeks looking around,
[01:22:40.360 --> 01:22:41.600]   thought I found a guy,
[01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:43.920]   he went by the screen name of Fake ID Man.
[01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:47.700]   Thought I found a guy, sent him $200, sent him my picture.
[01:22:47.700 --> 01:22:49.120]   Dude rips me off.
[01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:51.520]   (laughing)
[01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:53.520]   I'm like, what the hell, man?
[01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:54.360]   Oh, I got played.
[01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:57.920]   He had a little website set up with reviews,
[01:22:57.920 --> 01:22:59.400]   and I'm like, oh, it's all legitimate.
[01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:01.800]   He's building that trust that I talked about.
[01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:06.160]   So, the end result, I got pissed.
[01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:11.160]   And there was no site that dealt with anything
[01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:14.000]   criminal or cyber crime related.
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:17.040]   The only real avenue you had was an IRC chat session,
[01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:18.520]   internet relay chat.
[01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:20.760]   And that, I'm sure you've been on that.
[01:23:20.760 --> 01:23:22.800]   It's this rolling chat board.
[01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:24.680]   You don't know who the hell you're talking to.
[01:23:24.680 --> 01:23:26.000]   Most of them are full of shit.
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:27.280]   You can't trust anybody,
[01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:29.440]   and you're sitting there trying to conduct business.
[01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:32.200]   So, if somebody claims they've got a product or service,
[01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:33.400]   do they have it, does it work,
[01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:34.400]   or are they just gonna rip you off?
[01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:37.000]   Because in those channels, everyone's a criminal.
[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:40.920]   I kept looking around,
[01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:44.600]   and I happened upon a website called Counterfeit Library.
[01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:46.720]   And Counterfeit Library only dealt
[01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:49.120]   with counterfeit degrees and certificates,
[01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:51.720]   as well as degree meal type stuff.
[01:23:51.720 --> 01:23:55.320]   But they had a forum, and no one was using the forum.
[01:23:55.320 --> 01:23:58.360]   So, I basically get on there and bitch every day.
[01:23:58.360 --> 01:24:00.360]   I got ripped off, don't know what to do,
[01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:01.560]   bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.
[01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:03.280]   About the same time I started doing that,
[01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:04.820]   two other guys show up.
[01:24:04.820 --> 01:24:07.360]   One's named Mr. X, he's out of Los Angeles.
[01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:08.720]   The other guy's named Beelzebub,
[01:24:08.720 --> 01:24:11.760]   he's out of Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan.
[01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:13.480]   And we all become buddies.
[01:24:13.480 --> 01:24:15.240]   So, a few weeks of me bitching,
[01:24:15.240 --> 01:24:16.800]   a few weeks of them responding.
[01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:20.800]   Beelzebub gets me on ICQ, and he sends me a message.
[01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:22.560]   He's like, I went by the screen name of Gollum
[01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:24.060]   at that point, Gollum Fun.
[01:24:24.060 --> 01:24:26.080]   And he's like, "Gollum, I can make you
[01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:26.920]   "a fake driver's license."
[01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:28.640]   And I was like, "Well, motherfucker, do it."
[01:24:28.640 --> 01:24:30.640]   And he's like, "Well, I'm gonna charge you for it."
[01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:32.320]   I'm like, "Yeah, you are."
[01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:33.880]   He's like, "I am."
[01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:35.440]   I was like, "No, you're not."
[01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:37.900]   And he's like, "Look, man," he said,
[01:24:37.900 --> 01:24:40.140]   "this business, if you're gonna do this,
[01:24:40.140 --> 01:24:44.120]   "you have to trust people, or you're gonna fail."
[01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:46.660]   He said, "So, I'm gonna charge you $200,
[01:24:46.660 --> 01:24:49.000]   "but I'm gonna send you a driver's license."
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.080]   Well, by this point, I'm friends with the people
[01:24:51.080 --> 01:24:53.080]   who own Counterfeit Library.
[01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:55.640]   We're emailing, chatting, everything else.
[01:24:55.640 --> 01:24:59.500]   And I tell him, I'm like, "Okay, I'm gonna send you $200.
[01:24:59.500 --> 01:25:02.280]   "That way, when you rip me off, I'll have them ban you,
[01:25:02.280 --> 01:25:04.000]   "and I don't have to deal with you anymore."
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:04.880]   And he's like, "Bet."
[01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:06.360]   I'm like, "Okay."
[01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:08.860]   So, I sent him $200, sent him my picture.
[01:25:08.860 --> 01:25:11.680]   Two weeks later, I get a driver's license,
[01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:13.720]   name is Steven Schweke, out of Ohio,
[01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:17.340]   and real guy, worked at ADP Payroll to this day,
[01:25:17.340 --> 01:25:19.760]   works at ADP, is where the guy works.
[01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:23.420]   Got the driver's license, and to me,
[01:25:23.420 --> 01:25:25.660]   at that point in time, it was the prettiest thing
[01:25:25.660 --> 01:25:27.300]   that I'd ever seen.
[01:25:27.300 --> 01:25:29.540]   I'd never seen a fake ID before.
[01:25:29.540 --> 01:25:30.820]   I thought it was great.
[01:25:30.820 --> 01:25:32.920]   Turns out, looking back, it was like, eh.
[01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:39.620]   - That is kind of a strong first step
[01:25:39.620 --> 01:25:42.540]   in creating a fake identity.
[01:25:42.540 --> 01:25:43.540]   - Very strong.
[01:25:43.540 --> 01:25:44.380]   Very strong.
[01:25:44.380 --> 01:25:46.180]   So, this guy-- - So, that was like,
[01:25:46.180 --> 01:25:51.180]   Gasko just, on the point he made,
[01:25:51.180 --> 01:25:54.340]   that if you're gonna be successful in this,
[01:25:54.340 --> 01:25:56.940]   you should have people you trust.
[01:25:56.940 --> 01:25:58.000]   Is he right on that?
[01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.060]   - Oh, he's absolutely right.
[01:26:00.060 --> 01:26:00.900]   He's absolutely right.
[01:26:00.900 --> 01:26:03.680]   - So, you have to have, this is like mob.
[01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:04.520]   - You have to--
[01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:07.780]   - You have to have an inner circle that you trust.
[01:26:07.780 --> 01:26:10.340]   - I'm sure you've probably heard me say this before.
[01:26:11.420 --> 01:26:14.580]   Successful cyber crime, all right?
[01:26:14.580 --> 01:26:17.580]   There are three necessities to being successful online
[01:26:17.580 --> 01:26:18.540]   if you're a criminal.
[01:26:18.540 --> 01:26:21.080]   Three necessities are gathering data,
[01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:24.260]   committing the crime, and then cashing it out.
[01:26:24.260 --> 01:26:26.700]   All three of those necessities have to work in conjunction.
[01:26:26.700 --> 01:26:28.420]   If they don't, the crime fails.
[01:26:28.420 --> 01:26:30.740]   The problem, and it's a huge problem,
[01:26:30.740 --> 01:26:34.100]   is that one guy can't do all three things.
[01:26:34.100 --> 01:26:37.020]   You've got the people who gather the data.
[01:26:37.020 --> 01:26:39.700]   Basically, the general store sells people
[01:26:39.700 --> 01:26:44.540]   who sell PII, credit card logins, data tools.
[01:26:44.540 --> 01:26:46.260]   They always sell the spoofed phone numbers
[01:26:46.260 --> 01:26:48.620]   and the RDPs, stuff like that.
[01:26:48.620 --> 01:26:49.860]   A lot of the times, those people don't know
[01:26:49.860 --> 01:26:51.940]   how to commit the crime, and those people certainly
[01:26:51.940 --> 01:26:53.260]   don't know how to launder the money out
[01:26:53.260 --> 01:26:54.660]   and put cash in pocket.
[01:26:54.660 --> 01:26:58.060]   So, you've got, either because of a skill level,
[01:26:58.060 --> 01:27:00.180]   sometimes a geographic location,
[01:27:00.180 --> 01:27:03.300]   limits what that individual can do, all right?
[01:27:03.300 --> 01:27:06.220]   So, you have to rely on people who are good
[01:27:06.220 --> 01:27:08.620]   in areas where you are not in order
[01:27:08.620 --> 01:27:10.660]   for that crime to succeed.
[01:27:10.660 --> 01:27:15.420]   And that means you have to trust those people.
[01:27:15.420 --> 01:27:17.580]   So, what happens with Shadow Crew?
[01:27:17.580 --> 01:27:20.580]   All right, so, Counterfeit Library is the start, all right?
[01:27:20.580 --> 01:27:24.540]   Counterfeit Library transitions over to Shadow Crew.
[01:27:24.540 --> 01:27:27.900]   Right before that transition, there's a Ukrainian guy
[01:27:27.900 --> 01:27:29.660]   by the name of Dmitry Golubov.
[01:27:29.660 --> 01:27:31.300]   He was a spammer at that point in time.
[01:27:31.300 --> 01:27:34.500]   He saw what we were doing with Counterfeit Library,
[01:27:34.500 --> 01:27:36.020]   and he liked it.
[01:27:36.020 --> 01:27:37.820]   He was getting all these credit card details,
[01:27:37.820 --> 01:27:39.980]   and this kid, I mean, he's a kid,
[01:27:39.980 --> 01:27:42.260]   this kid has an idea, and his idea was,
[01:27:42.260 --> 01:27:45.260]   I wonder if people would buy stolen credit card details.
[01:27:45.260 --> 01:27:47.620]   - That's pretty good Ukrainian-Russian accent.
[01:27:47.620 --> 01:27:52.260]   - So, he picks up the phone, he calls his buddies,
[01:27:52.260 --> 01:27:55.060]   they call their buddies, they have a physical conference
[01:27:55.060 --> 01:27:58.460]   in Odessa, 150 of these cyber criminals show up,
[01:27:58.460 --> 01:28:01.580]   and they launch this idea, they launch a website
[01:28:01.580 --> 01:28:04.460]   called Carter Planet, which is the genesis
[01:28:04.460 --> 01:28:07.500]   of all modern credit card theft as we know it, all right?
[01:28:07.500 --> 01:28:10.700]   So, remember I mentioned those three necessities
[01:28:10.700 --> 01:28:11.540]   of cyber crime.
[01:28:11.540 --> 01:28:16.060]   Dmitry had all the credit data in the world,
[01:28:16.060 --> 01:28:17.820]   and he partnered with all these other Ukrainians
[01:28:17.820 --> 01:28:19.580]   who had all this data as well.
[01:28:19.580 --> 01:28:22.220]   The problem was, is so much fraud had been committed
[01:28:22.220 --> 01:28:24.100]   on that eastern side of Europe,
[01:28:24.100 --> 01:28:26.500]   that every card had been shut down.
[01:28:26.500 --> 01:28:28.900]   Even if you were a legitimate cardholder
[01:28:28.900 --> 01:28:30.980]   and tried to cash it out, you weren't doing it
[01:28:30.980 --> 01:28:32.060]   at that point.
[01:28:32.060 --> 01:28:33.740]   So, again, those three necessities,
[01:28:33.740 --> 01:28:35.860]   gathering data, committing crime, cashing out.
[01:28:35.860 --> 01:28:38.980]   Dmitry had the data, they could commit the crime,
[01:28:38.980 --> 01:28:41.660]   they could not put cash in pocket.
[01:28:41.660 --> 01:28:44.380]   So, we were running Counterfeit Library,
[01:28:44.380 --> 01:28:46.740]   one day I get this message, or not a message,
[01:28:46.740 --> 01:28:49.980]   one day, Scripps shows up, and he posts,
[01:28:49.980 --> 01:28:51.300]   just on the general forum, he posts,
[01:28:51.300 --> 01:28:53.300]   "Hey, I've got credit card data.
[01:28:53.300 --> 01:28:56.540]   "Give me an address, give me a burner phone number,
[01:28:56.540 --> 01:28:58.940]   "wait five business days, order whatever you want to."
[01:28:58.940 --> 01:29:01.340]   We had never seen anything like that,
[01:29:01.340 --> 01:29:03.660]   we were a PayPal fraud and eBay fraud site,
[01:29:03.660 --> 01:29:06.260]   is what we were, and fake driver's licenses.
[01:29:06.260 --> 01:29:08.260]   So, and we had, I guess we had two,
[01:29:08.260 --> 01:29:09.940]   three thousand members at that point.
[01:29:09.940 --> 01:29:13.860]   So, the response from the members was,
[01:29:13.860 --> 01:29:16.180]   that can't be real.
[01:29:16.180 --> 01:29:17.580]   You've gotta be law enforcement,
[01:29:17.580 --> 01:29:19.500]   it's gotta be trying to get us arrested
[01:29:19.500 --> 01:29:20.500]   and everything else.
[01:29:20.500 --> 01:29:23.380]   Let me backtrack a little bit.
[01:29:23.380 --> 01:29:27.100]   So, the driver's license that I had got,
[01:29:27.100 --> 01:29:28.780]   Beelzebub had an idea.
[01:29:28.780 --> 01:29:32.180]   What he wanted to do, is he wanted to sell
[01:29:32.180 --> 01:29:33.340]   driver's licenses.
[01:29:33.340 --> 01:29:36.620]   Mr. X wanted to sell social security cards,
[01:29:36.620 --> 01:29:39.180]   he made a very passable social security card.
[01:29:39.180 --> 01:29:40.900]   Me, I had no skill level on that,
[01:29:40.900 --> 01:29:42.820]   I knew PayPal fraud and eBay fraud.
[01:29:42.820 --> 01:29:45.380]   So, Beelzebub was like, "Tell you what,
[01:29:45.380 --> 01:29:47.220]   "you be the reviewer.
[01:29:47.220 --> 01:29:49.340]   "That way you get every product or service
[01:29:49.340 --> 01:29:51.340]   "that comes in, they'll have to send it to you,
[01:29:51.340 --> 01:29:52.940]   "or let you have access to it,
[01:29:52.940 --> 01:29:55.360]   "you can learn the entire game,
[01:29:55.360 --> 01:29:57.760]   "and because you're not selling anything,
[01:29:57.760 --> 01:30:00.500]   "it gives you legitimacy on the reviews."
[01:30:00.500 --> 01:30:01.380]   All right?
[01:30:01.380 --> 01:30:02.620]   So, I started out as a reviewer,
[01:30:02.620 --> 01:30:05.620]   the only reviewer on Counterfeit Library.
[01:30:05.620 --> 01:30:08.740]   So, over the next year, Beelzebub,
[01:30:08.740 --> 01:30:10.100]   turns out he was a pot grower.
[01:30:10.100 --> 01:30:11.780]   He goes back to growing pot,
[01:30:11.780 --> 01:30:14.420]   because he wasn't making shit selling driver's licenses.
[01:30:14.420 --> 01:30:16.780]   Mr. X, about a year and a half in,
[01:30:16.780 --> 01:30:19.500]   he gets arrested, cashing out driver's,
[01:30:19.500 --> 01:30:20.500]   credit card, not credit cards,
[01:30:20.500 --> 01:30:24.180]   cashing out at casinos, doing some shit with that.
[01:30:24.180 --> 01:30:26.160]   So, I'm the only guy left standing,
[01:30:26.160 --> 01:30:27.580]   and I'm at the top of the heap.
[01:30:27.580 --> 01:30:30.420]   So, and it becomes this thing where,
[01:30:30.420 --> 01:30:33.860]   if I review somebody, they make a lot of money.
[01:30:33.860 --> 01:30:36.700]   If I don't, you don't do business here.
[01:30:36.700 --> 01:30:38.780]   So, Scripps shows up, saying he's got this,
[01:30:38.780 --> 01:30:40.480]   I'm the only reviewer on site.
[01:30:40.480 --> 01:30:43.900]   People think he's law enforcement.
[01:30:43.900 --> 01:30:45.460]   First week, it goes like that.
[01:30:45.460 --> 01:30:47.260]   After a while, I'm like, "Okay, I gotta do something."
[01:30:47.260 --> 01:30:48.740]   And I'm scared, man, 'cause I'm like,
[01:30:48.740 --> 01:30:50.540]   "He may be law enforcement."
[01:30:50.540 --> 01:30:51.920]   So, I get him on ICQ, and I'm like,
[01:30:51.920 --> 01:30:53.100]   "Hey, you have to be reviewed."
[01:30:53.100 --> 01:30:54.700]   He's like, "What the hell is that?"
[01:30:54.700 --> 01:30:56.780]   So, I tell him what it is, he's like, "You review me."
[01:30:56.780 --> 01:30:58.500]   I was like, "Yeah, that's the idea."
[01:30:58.500 --> 01:31:00.660]   So, give him a drop address,
[01:31:00.660 --> 01:31:04.420]   give him a burner phone number, wait five business days,
[01:31:04.420 --> 01:31:06.820]   and I try to hit Dell for $5,000.
[01:31:06.820 --> 01:31:08.100]   The order fails.
[01:31:08.100 --> 01:31:10.340]   I get back on ICQ, "Hey, man, it didn't work."
[01:31:10.340 --> 01:31:11.940]   He's like, "Give me one more chance."
[01:31:11.940 --> 01:31:13.660]   I was like, "Look, I'll give you one more chance,
[01:31:13.660 --> 01:31:15.020]   "but it's your ass after that."
[01:31:15.020 --> 01:31:16.660]   And he's like, "One more chance."
[01:31:16.660 --> 01:31:17.500]   I'm like, "Okay."
[01:31:17.500 --> 01:31:20.060]   Give him another address, another phone number,
[01:31:20.060 --> 01:31:22.380]   wait another five business days,
[01:31:22.380 --> 01:31:25.300]   hit Thompson's Computer Warehouse for $4,000,
[01:31:25.300 --> 01:31:26.860]   Dell for $5,000.
[01:31:26.860 --> 01:31:28.860]   Order goes through, get the products in.
[01:31:28.860 --> 01:31:33.820]   I post that review on Counterfeit Library,
[01:31:33.820 --> 01:31:36.940]   and literally overnight, we turn from an eBay,
[01:31:36.940 --> 01:31:39.940]   PayPal fraud site to a credit theft site.
[01:31:39.940 --> 01:31:44.100]   And that becomes a lot of money really quickly for members.
[01:31:44.100 --> 01:31:46.700]   So, we were doing, now it's called CMP fraud,
[01:31:46.700 --> 01:31:47.660]   Card Not Present fraud.
[01:31:47.660 --> 01:31:49.660]   So, you hit an online merchant
[01:31:49.660 --> 01:31:51.220]   with stolen credit card data.
[01:31:51.220 --> 01:31:54.500]   Back then, a fairly experienced fraudster
[01:31:54.500 --> 01:31:57.420]   could profit 30 to $40,000 a month.
[01:31:57.420 --> 01:31:58.580]   Okay?
[01:31:58.580 --> 01:32:01.700]   Just buying laptops, what have you, and cashing out,
[01:32:01.700 --> 01:32:03.900]   put them on eBay for sale and sell them like that.
[01:32:03.900 --> 01:32:06.820]   30 to 40K a month was the profit on that.
[01:32:06.820 --> 01:32:08.460]   Script had a lot of buddies.
[01:32:08.460 --> 01:32:10.980]   He had people like Roman Vega,
[01:32:10.980 --> 01:32:14.100]   these other guys that would sell not just credit card data,
[01:32:14.100 --> 01:32:17.260]   but counterfeit physical credit cards as well.
[01:32:17.260 --> 01:32:18.100]   We had-
[01:32:18.100 --> 01:32:20.060]   - Counterfeit, not stolen.
[01:32:20.060 --> 01:32:20.940]   So, counterfeit.
[01:32:20.940 --> 01:32:21.780]   - Counterfeit.
[01:32:22.980 --> 01:32:25.100]   - That must be tough to do.
[01:32:25.100 --> 01:32:25.940]   - So, the connections-
[01:32:25.940 --> 01:32:28.180]   - That must be harder than driver's license.
[01:32:28.180 --> 01:32:29.020]   - It's crazy.
[01:32:29.020 --> 01:32:32.780]   So, what BOA initially had,
[01:32:32.780 --> 01:32:37.100]   and I became the United States salesperson for BOA,
[01:32:37.100 --> 01:32:38.220]   but what he had was,
[01:32:38.220 --> 01:32:42.420]   is he was the first dumps provider in the United States.
[01:32:42.420 --> 01:32:44.500]   So, on the back of your credit or debit card,
[01:32:44.500 --> 01:32:47.020]   there's a magnetic stripe.
[01:32:47.020 --> 01:32:48.380]   Three data tracks on the stripe.
[01:32:48.380 --> 01:32:50.340]   There was the first data track is customer's name,
[01:32:50.340 --> 01:32:52.540]   second data track is the card number,
[01:32:52.540 --> 01:32:56.020]   forward slash, 16 digit algorithm outside of that.
[01:32:56.020 --> 01:32:56.860]   That's important.
[01:32:56.860 --> 01:32:58.460]   We'll get back to that in a few minutes.
[01:32:58.460 --> 01:33:00.460]   Third data track is called indiscriminate data.
[01:33:00.460 --> 01:33:01.420]   No one uses it.
[01:33:01.420 --> 01:33:05.660]   So, what's bought and sold is the second data track.
[01:33:05.660 --> 01:33:06.860]   It's called the dump.
[01:33:06.860 --> 01:33:10.020]   And the reason that's sold is when you go into a shop,
[01:33:10.020 --> 01:33:12.780]   you insert the card or you swipe the card,
[01:33:12.780 --> 01:33:15.260]   the only information that's sent out for verification
[01:33:15.260 --> 01:33:17.220]   is the second data track.
[01:33:17.220 --> 01:33:19.700]   That goes to the processor bank for verification.
[01:33:19.700 --> 01:33:21.580]   The first data track that customer's name
[01:33:21.580 --> 01:33:24.580]   shows up on the screen of the cashier in front of you.
[01:33:24.580 --> 01:33:26.340]   So, what typically happens is,
[01:33:26.340 --> 01:33:28.180]   is you buy 10 of these dumps.
[01:33:28.180 --> 01:33:30.540]   You get 10 counterfeit cards.
[01:33:30.540 --> 01:33:32.380]   Encode track two on all 10 cards.
[01:33:32.380 --> 01:33:35.300]   Track one, you create one fake driver's license.
[01:33:35.300 --> 01:33:36.660]   Track one is just the name
[01:33:36.660 --> 01:33:38.140]   of that one fake driver's license.
[01:33:38.140 --> 01:33:39.500]   That way, when you go in the shop,
[01:33:39.500 --> 01:33:42.060]   swipe the card, track two gets sent off for verification.
[01:33:42.060 --> 01:33:44.900]   Track one shows up on the screen in front of the cashier.
[01:33:44.900 --> 01:33:47.540]   If you ever ask for ID, you pull out the fake ID.
[01:33:47.540 --> 01:33:48.820]   Everyone's nice, warm, fuzzy.
[01:33:48.820 --> 01:33:51.140]   You walk out with the cameras, Rolex.
[01:33:51.140 --> 01:33:54.060]   - And track one could be, it doesn't have to be connected.
[01:33:54.060 --> 01:33:55.100]   It's not connected to track two.
[01:33:55.100 --> 01:33:56.300]   - Not connected at all.
[01:33:56.300 --> 01:33:57.260]   All right.
[01:33:57.260 --> 01:33:59.180]   That's one of the big problems, all right?
[01:33:59.180 --> 01:34:00.020]   - Yeah.
[01:34:00.020 --> 01:34:05.020]   - So, Scrip brought a host of technical people
[01:34:05.020 --> 01:34:06.980]   into that type of environment,
[01:34:06.980 --> 01:34:08.500]   all committing credit card theft.
[01:34:08.500 --> 01:34:10.180]   We had proxy providers.
[01:34:10.180 --> 01:34:13.040]   We had all these people that were doing this stuff.
[01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:15.540]   We start making a lot of money, a lot.
[01:34:15.540 --> 01:34:17.620]   And the reason that happens is, again,
[01:34:17.620 --> 01:34:21.140]   Scrip did not have the ability to cash out.
[01:34:21.140 --> 01:34:23.580]   So he was reduced to selling things.
[01:34:23.580 --> 01:34:25.140]   And at the same time, he's looking for,
[01:34:25.140 --> 01:34:26.620]   how do I make more money?
[01:34:26.620 --> 01:34:28.100]   All right?
[01:34:28.100 --> 01:34:31.500]   The Ukrainians happened upon this thing
[01:34:31.500 --> 01:34:34.380]   called the CVV-1 breach, or hack,
[01:34:34.380 --> 01:34:36.100]   is what they called it.
[01:34:36.100 --> 01:34:39.080]   So what happens is, remember I told you of track two.
[01:34:39.080 --> 01:34:43.420]   Card number, forward slash, 16-digit algorithm.
[01:34:43.420 --> 01:34:46.280]   You gotta know the algorithm to encode it
[01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:49.340]   so you can swipe the card or take it to the ATM machine.
[01:34:49.340 --> 01:34:50.180]   All right?
[01:34:50.180 --> 01:34:51.760]   ATM.
[01:34:51.760 --> 01:34:52.780]   You gotta know it.
[01:34:52.780 --> 01:34:54.800]   Now, we were fishing data from hell.
[01:34:54.800 --> 01:34:58.540]   I mean, we were doing a lot of fishing, a lot.
[01:34:58.540 --> 01:35:01.340]   We were getting pins, we were getting card numbers,
[01:35:01.340 --> 01:35:03.620]   but you can't get that algorithm.
[01:35:03.620 --> 01:35:05.840]   So, the Ukrainians start testing stuff.
[01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:08.860]   What they found out was,
[01:35:08.860 --> 01:35:13.620]   no bank had implemented the hash on track two.
[01:35:13.620 --> 01:35:15.860]   So, you take the card number, forward slash,
[01:35:15.860 --> 01:35:19.340]   any 16 digits, it would encode.
[01:35:19.340 --> 01:35:21.800]   Take it to the ATM, pull cash out,
[01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:23.100]   'cause you got the pin.
[01:35:23.100 --> 01:35:24.220]   All right?
[01:35:24.220 --> 01:35:26.280]   Started doing that.
[01:35:26.280 --> 01:35:28.620]   - Well, wait, sorry, I'm trying to understand.
[01:35:28.620 --> 01:35:32.020]   So, that means, so if there's no,
[01:35:32.020 --> 01:35:34.640]   are they generating random numbers,
[01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:37.080]   or do they have valid numbers for track two?
[01:35:37.080 --> 01:35:38.320]   - No numbers were needed at all,
[01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:41.800]   as long as just the track two was a complete track two.
[01:35:41.800 --> 01:35:45.680]   - So, it's a valid track two that doesn't matter,
[01:35:45.680 --> 01:35:48.560]   so the pin is the thing that gets you in?
[01:35:48.560 --> 01:35:49.760]   - So, back then, all right,
[01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:51.200]   back then what we're talking about is,
[01:35:51.200 --> 01:35:54.320]   you need to, typically, today you'd need a whole track two.
[01:35:54.320 --> 01:35:55.800]   You need that valid track two.
[01:35:55.800 --> 01:35:59.000]   All right, you need the 16 digit card number,
[01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.320]   the forward slash, and then whatever that algorithm
[01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:02.360]   is on the side of it.
[01:36:02.360 --> 01:36:03.200]   All right?
[01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:04.840]   Back then, none of the banks
[01:36:04.840 --> 01:36:06.760]   had implemented that algorithm.
[01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:08.920]   So, while the algorithm was there,
[01:36:08.920 --> 01:36:11.340]   you didn't need it to encode.
[01:36:11.340 --> 01:36:14.440]   - Interesting.
[01:36:14.440 --> 01:36:15.880]   - Interesting.
[01:36:15.880 --> 01:36:18.280]   - So, you can't make a lot of money
[01:36:18.280 --> 01:36:23.280]   with physical fake credit cards, debit cards.
[01:36:23.280 --> 01:36:25.480]   - Card not present fraud, remember I told you,
[01:36:25.480 --> 01:36:27.480]   was $30,000 to $40,000 a month.
[01:36:27.480 --> 01:36:28.320]   All right?
[01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:32.520]   That turned into $30,000 to $40,000 a day.
[01:36:32.520 --> 01:36:35.680]   The Ukrainians, again, they can't cash it out.
[01:36:35.680 --> 01:36:38.200]   They've got all the data on the planet,
[01:36:38.200 --> 01:36:39.240]   but they can't cash it out,
[01:36:39.240 --> 01:36:41.400]   those three necessities of cyber crime.
[01:36:41.400 --> 01:36:44.580]   So, the deal became, you have to rely on the Americans.
[01:36:44.580 --> 01:36:46.600]   Tell you what, we'll give you 40%.
[01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:49.880]   So, you had all these cashiers that were 40%
[01:36:49.880 --> 01:36:51.160]   of $40,000 a day.
[01:36:51.160 --> 01:36:52.280]   Yeah, we'll take that.
[01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:53.340]   All right?
[01:36:53.340 --> 01:36:55.560]   Send the rest of it over to buy Western Union
[01:36:55.560 --> 01:36:57.880]   or what have you to your Ukrainian contact.
[01:36:57.880 --> 01:36:59.720]   That's before cryptocurrency came into play.
[01:36:59.720 --> 01:37:01.760]   Now, you had a couple of forerunners with E-Gold
[01:37:01.760 --> 01:37:04.320]   and Liberty Reserve, things like that.
[01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:07.660]   But, back then, it starts out with Western Union,
[01:37:07.660 --> 01:37:09.360]   then it becomes prepaid cards,
[01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:11.120]   sending track information over,
[01:37:11.120 --> 01:37:12.440]   loading the card up like that,
[01:37:12.440 --> 01:37:14.480]   and then finally you get to E-Gold, Liberty Reserve,
[01:37:14.480 --> 01:37:17.340]   and today it's with crypto that's used.
[01:37:17.340 --> 01:37:23.240]   Started stealing a lot of money, a lot.
[01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:26.560]   And that got law enforcement attention.
[01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:30.400]   So, we started to see, I mean, it's a crazy ass story.
[01:37:30.400 --> 01:37:33.600]   We started to see IPs coming in
[01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:35.640]   from law enforcement agencies, government agencies,
[01:37:35.640 --> 01:37:37.200]   because back then, they didn't know how to shield
[01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:38.260]   your identity either.
[01:37:38.260 --> 01:37:42.060]   So, you saw Secret Service, you saw DOD,
[01:37:42.060 --> 01:37:45.460]   you saw all these, and you're like, that's interesting.
[01:37:45.460 --> 01:37:52.600]   At the same time, we had, it was called a hack,
[01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:54.140]   but it wasn't a hack.
[01:37:54.140 --> 01:37:58.840]   We had a guy that worked at T-Mobile in Los Angeles.
[01:37:58.840 --> 01:38:01.260]   This is the same guy that, back then,
[01:38:01.260 --> 01:38:04.620]   published Paris Hilton's phone contact list.
[01:38:04.620 --> 01:38:06.100]   That made a lot of news.
[01:38:06.860 --> 01:38:09.780]   Not only did he do that, but it turned out
[01:38:09.780 --> 01:38:12.420]   that the Los Angeles Secret Service agency
[01:38:12.420 --> 01:38:14.220]   was using T-Mobile phones.
[01:38:14.220 --> 01:38:17.940]   So, he's getting text messages of the Secret Service
[01:38:17.940 --> 01:38:19.980]   investigating Shadow Crew,
[01:38:19.980 --> 01:38:21.820]   and he posts those damn things on Shadow Crew.
[01:38:21.820 --> 01:38:23.900]   So, I'm sitting there going, head of the pile.
[01:38:23.900 --> 01:38:27.060]   I'm sitting there going, this is not gonna end well.
[01:38:27.060 --> 01:38:28.620]   This is not gonna end well.
[01:38:28.620 --> 01:38:31.420]   So, at the same time, I had access,
[01:38:31.420 --> 01:38:33.100]   I started out with access
[01:38:33.100 --> 01:38:35.700]   to the Indiana State Sex Offenders Registry,
[01:38:35.700 --> 01:38:37.860]   and I was using that to create bank accounts,
[01:38:37.860 --> 01:38:38.700]   laundered the money out,
[01:38:38.700 --> 01:38:40.980]   and I would sell the bank accounts, stuff like that.
[01:38:40.980 --> 01:38:43.140]   They shut that down.
[01:38:43.140 --> 01:38:44.940]   The next database I had access to
[01:38:44.940 --> 01:38:47.660]   was the Texas Driver's License Database,
[01:38:47.660 --> 01:38:51.100]   and started using that to create fake driver's licenses,
[01:38:51.100 --> 01:38:52.140]   what have you.
[01:38:52.140 --> 01:38:54.440]   And then, finally, we happened upon
[01:38:54.440 --> 01:38:57.300]   the California Death Index.
[01:38:57.300 --> 01:38:58.860]   All right?
[01:38:58.860 --> 01:38:59.860]   Complete information.
[01:38:59.860 --> 01:39:03.380]   Mother's Maiden, socials, DOBs, all that.
[01:39:03.380 --> 01:39:06.260]   And it's like, gotta be a use for that.
[01:39:06.260 --> 01:39:09.660]   Well, you can use it to create identities all day long.
[01:39:09.660 --> 01:39:14.660]   My idea was, I wonder if you could take somebody
[01:39:14.660 --> 01:39:18.460]   that's died and then file for social security death,
[01:39:18.460 --> 01:39:20.320]   not death benefits, but social security benefits
[01:39:20.320 --> 01:39:23.180]   for that individual, and get that recurring paycheck in.
[01:39:23.180 --> 01:39:24.660]   So, that takes a lot of research
[01:39:24.660 --> 01:39:26.780]   to start seeing if you can do that.
[01:39:26.780 --> 01:39:29.420]   How does the federal government know if you're dead?
[01:39:29.420 --> 01:39:32.700]   Do federal indexes reference state indexes?
[01:39:32.700 --> 01:39:34.940]   You got all these questions that pop up.
[01:39:34.940 --> 01:39:36.780]   Well, it turns out, federal indexes
[01:39:36.780 --> 01:39:38.260]   don't reference state indexes.
[01:39:38.260 --> 01:39:39.780]   It's against the law.
[01:39:39.780 --> 01:39:42.220]   It also turns out, the only way the federal government
[01:39:42.220 --> 01:39:46.100]   knows you're dead is prior to 1998,
[01:39:46.100 --> 01:39:51.000]   the family had to file a social security death benefit
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:52.540]   for that person.
[01:39:52.540 --> 01:39:53.820]   All right?
[01:39:53.820 --> 01:39:54.660]   Prior to '98--
[01:39:54.660 --> 01:39:56.020]   - Which, of course, most people don't.
[01:39:56.020 --> 01:39:58.580]   - Right, prior to '98, it took the family.
[01:39:58.580 --> 01:40:01.220]   After '98, the hospital can do it,
[01:40:01.220 --> 01:40:03.580]   the funeral home can do it, or the family can do it.
[01:40:03.580 --> 01:40:06.540]   So, a lot more people have it filed if they've died.
[01:40:06.540 --> 01:40:08.340]   - But it's still, there's a lot of people
[01:40:08.340 --> 01:40:09.860]   probably-- - A lot of people don't.
[01:40:09.860 --> 01:40:13.260]   Because that death benefit's only like $219.
[01:40:13.260 --> 01:40:14.100]   - Yeah.
[01:40:14.100 --> 01:40:16.000]   - Okay, nobody's thinking about that shit.
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:19.880]   So, I started to apply for social security benefits.
[01:40:19.880 --> 01:40:21.780]   Nope, number's dormant.
[01:40:21.780 --> 01:40:23.780]   So, they want you to come in for a physical interview.
[01:40:23.780 --> 01:40:26.540]   Here I am, you know, 32.
[01:40:26.540 --> 01:40:29.660]   You're not gonna pass as a 65-year-old, so no.
[01:40:29.660 --> 01:40:31.600]   So, the next idea I had was,
[01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:36.020]   wonder if you could file income tax returns on these people.
[01:40:36.020 --> 01:40:40.460]   Turns out you can, all day long.
[01:40:40.460 --> 01:40:44.060]   So, I started doing that, and I started to steal.
[01:40:44.060 --> 01:40:46.280]   Once I got ramped up, 'cause you test everything.
[01:40:46.280 --> 01:40:48.140]   You know, you're testing to make sure,
[01:40:48.140 --> 01:40:50.420]   I gotta figure out what the deposit instrument is
[01:40:50.420 --> 01:40:51.260]   and everything else.
[01:40:51.260 --> 01:40:53.260]   And once you get all that lined out,
[01:40:53.260 --> 01:40:55.980]   I started to steal $160,000 a week,
[01:40:55.980 --> 01:40:58.540]   every week for 10 months out of the year.
[01:40:58.540 --> 01:41:00.740]   - By paying taxes?
[01:41:00.740 --> 01:41:03.020]   - By filing fake returns.
[01:41:03.020 --> 01:41:05.100]   - Yeah, filing fake tax returns.
[01:41:05.100 --> 01:41:08.360]   - So, you find a business, and the way the system worked is
[01:41:08.360 --> 01:41:11.740]   the IRS will issue a refund on somebody
[01:41:11.740 --> 01:41:13.100]   before they're able to verify
[01:41:13.100 --> 01:41:15.380]   that that person worked for an employer.
[01:41:15.380 --> 01:41:17.460]   Still works like that today.
[01:41:17.460 --> 01:41:18.460]   All right, so.
[01:41:18.460 --> 01:41:20.580]   - And you're keeping the amounts relatively low.
[01:41:20.580 --> 01:41:22.620]   - Keeping it $3,000.
[01:41:22.620 --> 01:41:23.460]   - All right.
[01:41:23.460 --> 01:41:24.300]   - Amounts are very low.
[01:41:24.300 --> 01:41:25.720]   - But you're still able to achieve scale
[01:41:25.720 --> 01:41:27.220]   because this large index of real people.
[01:41:27.220 --> 01:41:28.940]   - I got to where, and I was manual.
[01:41:28.940 --> 01:41:30.300]   Later on, a couple of buddies of mine
[01:41:30.300 --> 01:41:31.540]   went automated with it.
[01:41:31.540 --> 01:41:33.020]   - Wait, you were doing this by hand,
[01:41:33.020 --> 01:41:34.780]   so there's no code involved?
[01:41:34.780 --> 01:41:35.740]   - All manual.
[01:41:35.740 --> 01:41:36.580]   - Wow.
[01:41:36.580 --> 01:41:38.240]   - I'd file a return once every six minutes,
[01:41:38.240 --> 01:41:42.180]   work 10 hours a day, three days a week.
[01:41:42.180 --> 01:41:44.740]   - So, clicking on, so typing fast and clicking.
[01:41:44.740 --> 01:41:46.580]   - One return every six minutes.
[01:41:46.580 --> 01:41:49.340]   That's changing IP, that's changing address,
[01:41:49.340 --> 01:41:51.700]   everything else, one return every six minutes.
[01:41:51.700 --> 01:41:54.060]   For three days a week.
[01:41:54.060 --> 01:41:57.060]   Fourth day, I would take a road trip,
[01:41:57.060 --> 01:42:00.900]   plot out a map of ATMs, and then the next two days,
[01:42:00.900 --> 01:42:02.900]   cash out, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.
[01:42:02.900 --> 01:42:05.220]   All right, come back home, rinse and repeat.
[01:42:05.220 --> 01:42:09.020]   Turns out that a backpack, I don't see any sitting
[01:42:09.020 --> 01:42:12.940]   around here, but a backpack will hold $150,000 of 20s,
[01:42:12.940 --> 01:42:14.400]   is what it'll hold.
[01:42:14.400 --> 01:42:16.660]   So I'd put 150K in 20s in a backpack,
[01:42:16.660 --> 01:42:19.340]   I had a spare bedroom, I'd come in,
[01:42:19.340 --> 01:42:21.020]   toss the backpack in the bedroom.
[01:42:21.020 --> 01:42:23.060]   - This is very, very important information,
[01:42:23.060 --> 01:42:25.340]   and the fact that you know it is also very.
[01:42:25.340 --> 01:42:27.900]   First, we started with the volume of coal that weighs a ton,
[01:42:27.900 --> 01:42:32.260]   and now a backpack holds $150,000 of 20s,
[01:42:32.260 --> 01:42:35.300]   and then you can multiply that by five for hundreds.
[01:42:35.300 --> 01:42:36.260]   - Yeah.
[01:42:36.260 --> 01:42:37.100]   - I like this. - Of course, it's 20s,
[01:42:37.100 --> 01:42:39.660]   most of the time it's 20s coming out of an ATM, right?
[01:42:39.660 --> 01:42:40.500]   Each 20 weighs a gram. - That's true,
[01:42:40.500 --> 01:42:41.980]   you can't do 100.
[01:42:41.980 --> 01:42:43.860]   Each 20 weighs a gram.
[01:42:43.860 --> 01:42:45.500]   - So you can actually go by weight,
[01:42:45.500 --> 01:42:47.300]   which is what federal authorities do
[01:42:47.300 --> 01:42:49.900]   when they get a pallet of cash, they just weigh it.
[01:42:49.900 --> 01:42:52.180]   - Oh, they just weigh it, okay.
[01:42:52.180 --> 01:42:55.720]   - So 150K is seven and a half keys of cash.
[01:42:55.720 --> 01:42:57.140]   (laughing)
[01:42:57.140 --> 01:42:59.460]   - That's pretty light.
[01:42:59.460 --> 01:43:00.300]   - Not bad, not bad.
[01:43:00.300 --> 01:43:02.100]   - Yeah, so you get a big backpack,
[01:43:02.100 --> 01:43:05.760]   do a good run of David Goggins with it, nice, I like it.
[01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:08.580]   The fact, you know, this is great.
[01:43:08.580 --> 01:43:11.340]   So wait, where does that come in with the backpack?
[01:43:11.340 --> 01:43:14.060]   - So what happens is, I didn't know how to launder money.
[01:43:14.060 --> 01:43:17.300]   All right, so I'm throwing cash in the spare bedroom,
[01:43:17.300 --> 01:43:18.900]   one day you open up the bedroom,
[01:43:18.900 --> 01:43:22.180]   and you're like, gotta do something with those backpacks.
[01:43:22.180 --> 01:43:25.060]   And that's when you start learning how to launder money.
[01:43:25.060 --> 01:43:26.900]   You know, cash-based businesses, things like that.
[01:43:26.900 --> 01:43:28.060]   I had a production company,
[01:43:28.060 --> 01:43:29.580]   had a couple of detailing company,
[01:43:29.580 --> 01:43:31.940]   I was thinking about going into food trucks,
[01:43:31.940 --> 01:43:33.100]   things like that in Charleston.
[01:43:33.100 --> 01:43:35.300]   - Actually, can you pause on that to take a tangent there?
[01:43:35.300 --> 01:43:39.100]   How does money laundering work?
[01:43:39.100 --> 01:43:40.660]   I mean, at that time,
[01:43:40.660 --> 01:43:42.300]   and what years are we talking about?
[01:43:42.300 --> 01:43:46.880]   - This is, by the time the tax return schemes go into play,
[01:43:46.880 --> 01:43:51.020]   we're talking 2002, 2003 is when tax returns start.
[01:43:51.020 --> 01:43:53.300]   - And so what, at that time,
[01:43:53.300 --> 01:43:55.980]   and what you're aware of now, how it evolved,
[01:43:55.980 --> 01:43:58.360]   how does money laundering work?
[01:43:58.360 --> 01:44:00.660]   - You know, it's not that much different.
[01:44:00.660 --> 01:44:02.220]   It's really not.
[01:44:02.220 --> 01:44:04.180]   You get a cash-based business,
[01:44:04.180 --> 01:44:05.100]   start laundering the money,
[01:44:05.100 --> 01:44:06.180]   or putting the money through that,
[01:44:06.180 --> 01:44:08.100]   saying the transactions are legal.
[01:44:08.100 --> 01:44:11.180]   You then start depositing it into bank accounts.
[01:44:11.180 --> 01:44:14.060]   From bank accounts, my thing was,
[01:44:14.060 --> 01:44:19.060]   have bank accounts in the United States, Mexico, Canada,
[01:44:19.060 --> 01:44:22.400]   and then finally bounce over to Estonia,
[01:44:22.400 --> 01:44:24.040]   was the final destination of all this stuff.
[01:44:24.040 --> 01:44:28.460]   And the idea is to try to move them to so many places
[01:44:28.460 --> 01:44:31.200]   that by the end of the day, it looks legal,
[01:44:31.200 --> 01:44:34.480]   and you can't trace it all if you're ever caught,
[01:44:34.480 --> 01:44:36.280]   which you ultimately are.
[01:44:36.280 --> 01:44:38.280]   But, so the cash-based businesses--
[01:44:38.280 --> 01:44:40.040]   - So when you say, sorry to interrupt,
[01:44:40.040 --> 01:44:41.800]   the cash-based businesses,
[01:44:41.820 --> 01:44:46.820]   so you have money that needs to be moved to other people.
[01:44:46.820 --> 01:44:49.660]   So how does that work?
[01:44:49.660 --> 01:44:50.900]   What's the business?
[01:44:50.900 --> 01:44:52.700]   Are people providing you a service,
[01:44:52.700 --> 01:44:54.380]   and you're giving them money?
[01:44:54.380 --> 01:44:57.500]   - Right, so you do the Ozark thing if you wanna do that.
[01:44:57.500 --> 01:44:59.660]   So you can gamble, cash out something like that.
[01:44:59.660 --> 01:45:02.580]   So it trips to whatever casinos you've got.
[01:45:02.580 --> 01:45:05.900]   You've got your production company or your detail company.
[01:45:05.900 --> 01:45:08.100]   So how many cars you're cleaning a day,
[01:45:08.100 --> 01:45:10.260]   how many companies have you got to do that?
[01:45:10.260 --> 01:45:12.640]   All right, whatever that company is,
[01:45:12.640 --> 01:45:13.720]   it's gotta be cash-based.
[01:45:13.720 --> 01:45:16.920]   Somebody's paying you in cash is what you're doing.
[01:45:16.920 --> 01:45:19.020]   You have to have enough of those cash-based businesses
[01:45:19.020 --> 01:45:21.500]   where it doesn't look funny, all right?
[01:45:21.500 --> 01:45:23.120]   Because if you're a detail company
[01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:26.120]   making $100,000 a month, that's a problem.
[01:45:26.120 --> 01:45:26.960]   (laughs)
[01:45:26.960 --> 01:45:27.780]   - Yeah.
[01:45:27.780 --> 01:45:30.340]   - Okay, so then you start depositing into that.
[01:45:30.340 --> 01:45:33.200]   Well, because of the Patriot Act,
[01:45:33.200 --> 01:45:36.160]   a suspicious activity report, SARS,
[01:45:36.160 --> 01:45:40.380]   came in at $2,500 instead of the 10K that it used to be.
[01:45:40.380 --> 01:45:42.260]   So all of a sudden, you've got multiple bank accounts
[01:45:42.260 --> 01:45:44.700]   that you've gotta set up, all right?
[01:45:44.700 --> 01:45:46.740]   Fortunately, what you also had is you had
[01:45:46.740 --> 01:45:47.980]   a bunch of prepaid debit cards
[01:45:47.980 --> 01:45:49.860]   that were coming into play at the same time.
[01:45:49.860 --> 01:45:53.760]   So a combination of bank accounts, prepaid debits
[01:45:53.760 --> 01:45:56.500]   that had ACH abilities attached to those as well,
[01:45:56.500 --> 01:45:58.380]   and you start running them all together.
[01:45:58.380 --> 01:46:00.260]   Then once it's out of the United States,
[01:46:00.260 --> 01:46:01.340]   you don't have to worry as much.
[01:46:01.340 --> 01:46:05.320]   You can start funneling that into fewer bank accounts
[01:46:05.320 --> 01:46:07.660]   until finally you've got the one main account
[01:46:07.660 --> 01:46:11.260]   that's over at Banco Leteco in Estonia at that point.
[01:46:11.260 --> 01:46:12.940]   That's what you've got.
[01:46:12.940 --> 01:46:14.860]   - So a bunch of hops that end up
[01:46:14.860 --> 01:46:16.340]   at a place that you can't trace.
[01:46:16.340 --> 01:46:17.180]   - And to give you an idea,
[01:46:17.180 --> 01:46:19.820]   I was arrested February 8th, 2005.
[01:46:19.820 --> 01:46:22.900]   My last seizure was 2010.
[01:46:22.900 --> 01:46:24.300]   Got the last seizure notice.
[01:46:24.300 --> 01:46:27.300]   So, took 'em, they got it,
[01:46:27.300 --> 01:46:30.300]   but it did took 'em that long to get to it.
[01:46:30.300 --> 01:46:33.180]   - So how do the stories like with Scrip
[01:46:33.180 --> 01:46:37.680]   that come into play here where he had someone
[01:46:37.680 --> 01:46:40.080]   who owed him money kidnapped and tortured,
[01:46:40.080 --> 01:46:45.080]   so when does it turn darker?
[01:46:45.080 --> 01:46:48.760]   - It turns darker the more money you make.
[01:46:48.760 --> 01:46:52.820]   Scrip was a kid that he was stealing enough money
[01:46:52.820 --> 01:46:55.080]   that he was able to buy whatever estate he wanted to,
[01:46:55.080 --> 01:46:57.960]   and he would brag about touring the countryside,
[01:46:57.960 --> 01:47:00.920]   and if he saw property that he liked, he would buy it.
[01:47:00.920 --> 01:47:03.820]   And that was not just a brag, he was doing that.
[01:47:03.820 --> 01:47:05.740]   So this kid is stealing a lot of money.
[01:47:05.740 --> 01:47:08.580]   At the same time, he's got connections politically
[01:47:08.580 --> 01:47:09.820]   because of his family.
[01:47:09.820 --> 01:47:12.020]   He's got connections, and that family's got connections
[01:47:12.020 --> 01:47:14.100]   with a Ukrainian mob, all right?
[01:47:14.100 --> 01:47:16.180]   So he's got these inroads,
[01:47:16.180 --> 01:47:17.700]   and people are looking out for him,
[01:47:17.700 --> 01:47:19.980]   and he's stealing a lot of money at the same time.
[01:47:19.980 --> 01:47:24.300]   Somebody doesn't pay him a decent amount of money.
[01:47:24.300 --> 01:47:25.340]   Somebody doesn't pay him.
[01:47:25.340 --> 01:47:28.140]   Now we had never, with Shadow Crew,
[01:47:28.140 --> 01:47:30.540]   with Carter Planet, with Counterfeit Library,
[01:47:30.540 --> 01:47:33.680]   we were basically the geeks, all right?
[01:47:33.680 --> 01:47:36.840]   We were just the fraudsters, the social engineers.
[01:47:36.840 --> 01:47:38.840]   We had never really considered violence.
[01:47:38.840 --> 01:47:40.520]   The rules that I had in play were,
[01:47:40.520 --> 01:47:43.120]   hey, we don't do child pornography,
[01:47:43.120 --> 01:47:46.780]   we don't do counterfeit currency, we don't do drugs.
[01:47:46.780 --> 01:47:48.860]   And the only thing we ended up really obeying
[01:47:48.860 --> 01:47:50.400]   was the child porn stuff,
[01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:52.800]   except for Max Butler, who you mentioned earlier.
[01:47:52.800 --> 01:47:57.180]   Scrip, someone rips the guy off,
[01:47:57.180 --> 01:48:02.180]   and he comes online on Shadow Crew at that point,
[01:48:02.180 --> 01:48:04.300]   and he posts these pictures one day.
[01:48:04.300 --> 01:48:06.580]   And I mean, it was a detailed narrative
[01:48:06.580 --> 01:48:07.420]   through the pictures.
[01:48:07.420 --> 01:48:10.340]   Had the guy that rammed in the van,
[01:48:10.340 --> 01:48:12.700]   had the door open, rammed in the van,
[01:48:12.700 --> 01:48:15.780]   had the guy tied up, had the guy being tortured,
[01:48:15.780 --> 01:48:20.260]   and the response was, this is what happens
[01:48:20.260 --> 01:48:22.500]   when you steal from me.
[01:48:22.500 --> 01:48:27.500]   And that's the first time that violence came into play
[01:48:27.500 --> 01:48:29.900]   at that point, and that's when things got,
[01:48:29.900 --> 01:48:32.540]   you start realizing things are getting a little serious.
[01:48:32.540 --> 01:48:34.640]   - How did that make you feel?
[01:48:34.640 --> 01:48:37.860]   - The first response is, can't be real.
[01:48:37.860 --> 01:48:41.460]   He's just doing that.
[01:48:41.460 --> 01:48:44.100]   He's wanting to send a message.
[01:48:44.100 --> 01:48:48.360]   Then you're like, no, that's real, that's real.
[01:48:48.360 --> 01:48:51.980]   - Were you afraid in your own heart
[01:48:51.980 --> 01:48:55.340]   that you might descend to that too?
[01:48:55.340 --> 01:48:58.420]   If you see that, or was it pretty clear to you
[01:48:58.420 --> 01:49:02.260]   that that's a line that some people can cross
[01:49:02.260 --> 01:49:04.100]   and some can't, and you're not one of those
[01:49:04.100 --> 01:49:04.980]   that can cross it?
[01:49:04.980 --> 01:49:07.740]   - You know, I gotta tell you, I joke with my wife.
[01:49:07.740 --> 01:49:13.020]   The joke I tell my wife is,
[01:49:13.020 --> 01:49:15.980]   if I knew some guy that had 8,000 Bitcoins,
[01:49:15.980 --> 01:49:19.580]   I might be persuaded to ask him for access to that.
[01:49:19.580 --> 01:49:20.460]   And she was like, how?
[01:49:20.460 --> 01:49:22.740]   And I was like, well, hammer and toes.
[01:49:22.740 --> 01:49:29.860]   I say that as a joke, but there's that line
[01:49:29.860 --> 01:49:33.780]   where you're like, I remember who I used to be.
[01:49:33.780 --> 01:49:37.540]   If you're looking at that kind of money,
[01:49:37.540 --> 01:49:40.960]   I might be persuaded to do that back then.
[01:49:40.960 --> 01:49:46.820]   And I think that was Scripps' issue,
[01:49:46.820 --> 01:49:49.220]   is it was a lot of money to him.
[01:49:49.220 --> 01:49:51.780]   - It was the money, and then there's,
[01:49:51.780 --> 01:49:53.300]   violence can also be gradual.
[01:49:53.300 --> 01:49:54.460]   So over time you do a little more,
[01:49:54.460 --> 01:49:57.260]   a little more, a little more, a little more.
[01:49:57.260 --> 01:49:58.820]   - You get used to what's going on, and then--
[01:49:58.820 --> 01:49:59.740]   - Get desensitized.
[01:49:59.740 --> 01:50:02.900]   - And you figure, you take somebody like Ross Ulbricht,
[01:50:02.900 --> 01:50:04.920]   the Silk Road guy, all right?
[01:50:04.920 --> 01:50:08.980]   Ross was not a violent guy, he was not.
[01:50:08.980 --> 01:50:12.340]   But at that point in time, he was sitting on 24 million
[01:50:12.340 --> 01:50:15.180]   in Bitcoin, he was the only game in town.
[01:50:15.180 --> 01:50:17.300]   And that 24 now is like, I don't know,
[01:50:17.300 --> 01:50:20.500]   22, 24 billion, some crap like that.
[01:50:20.500 --> 01:50:25.500]   But he felt in danger of,
[01:50:25.500 --> 01:50:28.700]   this guy was gonna turn him in.
[01:50:28.700 --> 01:50:29.980]   You know, it was a blackmail on him and everything.
[01:50:29.980 --> 01:50:34.860]   So Ross thinks he hires a couple hitmen to kill the guy.
[01:50:34.860 --> 01:50:36.740]   So it becomes that thing,
[01:50:36.740 --> 01:50:38.580]   and I saw that over and over again.
[01:50:38.580 --> 01:50:41.340]   And I'd like to say I wasn't like that,
[01:50:41.340 --> 01:50:44.020]   but given the same circumstances,
[01:50:44.020 --> 01:50:46.380]   I would have probably done the same thing.
[01:50:46.380 --> 01:50:49.140]   - And also when you're, it's not just about money,
[01:50:49.140 --> 01:50:50.320]   there's a lot of other forces.
[01:50:50.320 --> 01:50:54.500]   Like if you're threatened for your wellbeing,
[01:50:54.500 --> 01:50:56.340]   or for your wealth, or for your power,
[01:50:56.340 --> 01:50:59.380]   all of us operate under different motivations.
[01:50:59.380 --> 01:51:02.660]   - Plus that online aspect with those communities like that,
[01:51:02.660 --> 01:51:04.900]   if you're the head guy, you really feel like
[01:51:04.900 --> 01:51:06.420]   you're the parent of these guys.
[01:51:06.420 --> 01:51:07.940]   So if somebody's starting to threaten them,
[01:51:07.940 --> 01:51:10.500]   it's like, all right, what do I need to do?
[01:51:10.500 --> 01:51:12.100]   - So what do you make of Silk Road?
[01:51:12.100 --> 01:51:16.460]   The Shadow Crew started something that today
[01:51:16.460 --> 01:51:19.620]   you can call Darknet and Darknet markets.
[01:51:19.620 --> 01:51:22.380]   So these markets that operate, that trade,
[01:51:22.380 --> 01:51:28.700]   trade things, everything from child pornography to drugs,
[01:51:28.700 --> 01:51:30.940]   to, I mean, what else?
[01:51:30.940 --> 01:51:32.620]   - Everything.
[01:51:32.620 --> 01:51:34.780]   - What are the dark things that humans want to do
[01:51:34.780 --> 01:51:36.740]   that they don't want anyone to know about?
[01:51:36.740 --> 01:51:37.900]   All of those things.
[01:51:37.900 --> 01:51:38.740]   - Right.
[01:51:39.980 --> 01:51:44.100]   So can you maybe tell me, you know what,
[01:51:44.100 --> 01:51:45.220]   let's just even step back.
[01:51:45.220 --> 01:51:46.260]   What is the Darknet?
[01:51:46.260 --> 01:51:47.660]   How big is it?
[01:51:47.660 --> 01:51:48.980]   What happens there?
[01:51:48.980 --> 01:51:51.020]   - Let's backtrack a little bit more
[01:51:51.020 --> 01:51:53.140]   before we get to that, all right?
[01:51:53.140 --> 01:51:55.620]   What Shadow Crew did,
[01:51:55.620 --> 01:52:01.780]   other than dealing in all these stolen wares,
[01:52:01.780 --> 01:52:05.020]   what Shadow Crew did that's really important.
[01:52:05.020 --> 01:52:08.040]   Remember those three necessities that I talked about?
[01:52:08.040 --> 01:52:09.540]   But the important thing is,
[01:52:09.540 --> 01:52:13.220]   is it established trust among criminals, all right?
[01:52:13.220 --> 01:52:14.380]   Because that's a necessity.
[01:52:14.380 --> 01:52:17.460]   You have to be able to trust who you're dealing with
[01:52:17.460 --> 01:52:19.340]   'cause you have to deal with somebody.
[01:52:19.340 --> 01:52:21.260]   You have to, all right?
[01:52:21.260 --> 01:52:23.500]   So how do you know you're not dealing with a cop?
[01:52:23.500 --> 01:52:25.540]   How do you know you're dealing with somebody that's skilled?
[01:52:25.540 --> 01:52:26.660]   How do you know you're gonna deal with somebody
[01:52:26.660 --> 01:52:27.980]   that's not gonna rip you off?
[01:52:27.980 --> 01:52:30.060]   You have to be able to trust that individual.
[01:52:30.060 --> 01:52:32.980]   The Shadow Crew provided that trust mechanism for criminals.
[01:52:32.980 --> 01:52:35.820]   You had that communication channel, the forums,
[01:52:35.820 --> 01:52:37.720]   where you could reference conversations,
[01:52:37.720 --> 01:52:41.320]   weeks, months old, take part, learn from those conversations.
[01:52:41.320 --> 01:52:44.060]   You had vouching systems and review systems in place,
[01:52:44.060 --> 01:52:46.080]   escrow systems in place.
[01:52:46.080 --> 01:52:47.120]   You had, you could,
[01:52:47.120 --> 01:52:49.720]   knew by looking at someone's screen name,
[01:52:49.720 --> 01:52:51.480]   if you could trust the individual,
[01:52:51.480 --> 01:52:53.280]   network with the individual, all right?
[01:52:53.280 --> 01:52:57.520]   And that community of just humans
[01:52:57.520 --> 01:53:01.240]   provided that backbone of trust.
[01:53:01.240 --> 01:53:04.040]   And that's really interesting when you think about it.
[01:53:04.040 --> 01:53:05.480]   You had the trust that was there,
[01:53:05.480 --> 01:53:06.580]   but you also had this,
[01:53:06.580 --> 01:53:12.640]   almost this instantaneous information that was available
[01:53:12.640 --> 01:53:15.360]   about the community or about cybercrime at large.
[01:53:15.360 --> 01:53:18.020]   And that's still in play today, all right?
[01:53:18.020 --> 01:53:21.400]   So when, that was the way things were
[01:53:21.400 --> 01:53:23.120]   until a couple of things happened.
[01:53:23.120 --> 01:53:25.600]   And one was cryptocurrency.
[01:53:25.600 --> 01:53:28.960]   The other one was the Tor browser, the dark web.
[01:53:28.960 --> 01:53:30.900]   Now I was working with the Secret Service,
[01:53:30.900 --> 01:53:32.840]   ripping the Secret Service off,
[01:53:32.840 --> 01:53:34.840]   when Tor comes into play, all right?
[01:53:34.840 --> 01:53:37.000]   So we got a memo in one day
[01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:38.840]   and it was talking about the Tor browser.
[01:53:38.840 --> 01:53:41.840]   And it was like, we really need to be careful with this.
[01:53:41.840 --> 01:53:43.240]   This is going to be a problem.
[01:53:43.240 --> 01:53:45.640]   And so we all fired up the Tor browser
[01:53:45.640 --> 01:53:50.480]   and it turns out it was, this was 2005, early six.
[01:53:50.480 --> 01:53:52.160]   It turns out it was completely unusable.
[01:53:52.160 --> 01:53:53.220]   Could not use it at all,
[01:53:53.220 --> 01:53:55.080]   simply because no one was using it
[01:53:55.080 --> 01:53:56.440]   and it was extremely slow.
[01:53:56.440 --> 01:53:57.280]   So-
[01:53:57.280 --> 01:53:58.240]   - So for people who don't know,
[01:53:58.240 --> 01:54:01.440]   Tor browser is a way to be completely anonymous.
[01:54:01.440 --> 01:54:03.320]   - As long as you properly know how to use it.
[01:54:03.320 --> 01:54:04.600]   - Right. - Huge caveat.
[01:54:04.600 --> 01:54:05.440]   - Yeah. - All right.
[01:54:05.440 --> 01:54:07.840]   So developed by the United States Navy
[01:54:07.840 --> 01:54:10.080]   and they developed- - I know this.
[01:54:10.080 --> 01:54:12.200]   - Oh yeah. - It wasn't the hackers that-
[01:54:12.200 --> 01:54:13.280]   - Uh-uh. - Interesting.
[01:54:13.280 --> 01:54:17.280]   - US Navy, to this day, the number one funder of Tor?
[01:54:17.280 --> 01:54:20.400]   Military, to this day, all right?
[01:54:20.400 --> 01:54:21.240]   - Interesting.
[01:54:21.240 --> 01:54:22.480]   I mean, the same, I guess with the internet,
[01:54:22.480 --> 01:54:23.920]   the origins are-
[01:54:23.920 --> 01:54:24.760]   (laughing)
[01:54:24.760 --> 01:54:27.640]   - So it was developed so that operatives
[01:54:27.640 --> 01:54:28.880]   could communicate with each other
[01:54:28.880 --> 01:54:31.360]   without being identified, all right?
[01:54:31.360 --> 01:54:33.140]   That then goes open source.
[01:54:33.140 --> 01:54:35.200]   They release it, EFF comes in,
[01:54:35.200 --> 01:54:38.320]   starts sponsoring and everything else like that.
[01:54:38.320 --> 01:54:40.160]   The next idea was, well, you know,
[01:54:40.160 --> 01:54:42.560]   people can get around their country's firewalls,
[01:54:42.560 --> 01:54:44.160]   whistleblowers can use it, things like that.
[01:54:44.160 --> 01:54:45.800]   Well, someone forgot to mention
[01:54:45.800 --> 01:54:48.000]   that the first adoptees of tech,
[01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.920]   if you can use it to launder money or remain anonymous,
[01:54:50.920 --> 01:54:52.880]   are criminals.
[01:54:52.880 --> 01:54:56.660]   And so criminals start to use the damn thing, all right?
[01:54:56.660 --> 01:55:00.040]   So along the same time we get, well, a few years later,
[01:55:00.040 --> 01:55:05.040]   we get Satoshi Nakamoto pops up with his ideas for Bitcoin,
[01:55:05.040 --> 01:55:07.660]   and then Ross Ulbricht runs with it.
[01:55:07.660 --> 01:55:10.140]   Ross Ulbricht decides he's gonna start up Silk Road.
[01:55:10.140 --> 01:55:13.060]   So initially, the people who were using Tor,
[01:55:13.060 --> 01:55:15.100]   which later is the dark web,
[01:55:15.100 --> 01:55:18.580]   people were using Tor or just talking with each other,
[01:55:18.580 --> 01:55:21.560]   visiting websites, communicating like that.
[01:55:21.560 --> 01:55:22.700]   Someone figured out, hey, man,
[01:55:22.700 --> 01:55:25.920]   we could host websites on this thing,
[01:55:25.920 --> 01:55:28.960]   and they have a lot of trouble finding the box.
[01:55:28.960 --> 01:55:33.700]   So that is the advent of Silk Road all of a sudden.
[01:55:33.700 --> 01:55:35.140]   Ross Ulbricht has this idea
[01:55:35.140 --> 01:55:36.740]   that he's gonna change the world
[01:55:36.740 --> 01:55:40.940]   by becoming the largest drug dealer on the planet.
[01:55:40.940 --> 01:55:42.580]   So he opens up the Silk Road,
[01:55:42.580 --> 01:55:46.500]   and the only payment instrument he allows is Bitcoin.
[01:55:46.500 --> 01:55:48.660]   So if those people out there are wondering
[01:55:48.660 --> 01:55:51.780]   why Bitcoin is going at, what, 44K today?
[01:55:51.780 --> 01:55:52.620]   - Yeah. - Yeah, it starts up.
[01:55:52.620 --> 01:55:54.100]   - And by the time this is out,
[01:55:54.100 --> 01:55:56.700]   it could be 100,000 or 10,000. - Absolutely, absolutely.
[01:55:56.700 --> 01:55:57.700]   - We'll see. - Who knows?
[01:55:57.700 --> 01:55:59.440]   (laughing)
[01:55:59.440 --> 01:56:01.580]   If it's 10,000, I'm going to buy some.
[01:56:01.580 --> 01:56:04.020]   (laughing)
[01:56:04.020 --> 01:56:06.060]   - Which is a hilarious statement to make
[01:56:06.060 --> 01:56:09.240]   because that statement would be ridiculously wrong
[01:56:09.240 --> 01:56:10.460]   like five years ago, right?
[01:56:10.460 --> 01:56:12.720]   - I know, I know, I know.
[01:56:12.720 --> 01:56:14.580]   - People 100 years from now will be laughing.
[01:56:14.580 --> 01:56:15.980]   Wait, it was that low?
[01:56:15.980 --> 01:56:18.500]   (laughing)
[01:56:18.500 --> 01:56:20.100]   - So he only accepts Bitcoin,
[01:56:20.100 --> 01:56:23.900]   and that's, of course, the initial use case of crypto
[01:56:23.900 --> 01:56:26.540]   is no one wants to admit it today,
[01:56:26.540 --> 01:56:29.820]   but the initial use case is we're going to buy a bunch of pot.
[01:56:29.820 --> 01:56:30.820]   (laughing)
[01:56:30.820 --> 01:56:33.540]   We need somebody, we need a way to pay for it.
[01:56:33.540 --> 01:56:35.420]   So that's what happens.
[01:56:35.420 --> 01:56:38.740]   Ross, it's really interesting to me.
[01:56:38.740 --> 01:56:43.180]   If you look at motivations of cyber criminals,
[01:56:43.180 --> 01:56:47.980]   the motivations are status, cash, ideology, all right?
[01:56:47.980 --> 01:56:51.400]   My guys, all cash, across the board, all cash.
[01:56:51.400 --> 01:56:54.640]   Ross is ideology.
[01:56:54.640 --> 01:56:57.100]   He really believed he was going to change the world.
[01:56:57.100 --> 01:56:59.260]   He really did, and I've been fortunate.
[01:56:59.260 --> 01:57:03.660]   I actually know the guy who ran Silk Road 2
[01:57:03.660 --> 01:57:07.020]   and have talked to the kid, everything else,
[01:57:07.020 --> 01:57:10.040]   and I will tell you that those guys
[01:57:10.040 --> 01:57:13.060]   who are motivated by ideology,
[01:57:13.060 --> 01:57:16.060]   they are a completely different breed.
[01:57:16.060 --> 01:57:17.060]   They really are.
[01:57:17.060 --> 01:57:21.640]   It's not, you know, the cash guy, it's low-hanging fruit.
[01:57:21.640 --> 01:57:26.300]   The ease of, it's hard to stop committing crime,
[01:57:26.300 --> 01:57:29.380]   but it's much easier for a cash-motivated individual
[01:57:29.380 --> 01:57:32.500]   to stop than it is that ideology guy.
[01:57:32.500 --> 01:57:35.060]   That Silk Road 2 guy, he's still got it.
[01:57:35.060 --> 01:57:36.500]   You know, he's not breaking the law,
[01:57:36.500 --> 01:57:38.980]   but you can see it's like, he wants to.
[01:57:38.980 --> 01:57:40.140]   (laughing)
[01:57:40.140 --> 01:57:41.340]   He wants to.
[01:57:41.340 --> 01:57:42.180]   So it's--
[01:57:42.180 --> 01:57:45.740]   - That's fascinating that, I mean,
[01:57:45.740 --> 01:57:47.700]   the worst atrocities in human history
[01:57:47.700 --> 01:57:51.180]   are committed with people that operate under ideology.
[01:57:51.180 --> 01:57:53.160]   All the other motivations are much weaker.
[01:57:53.160 --> 01:57:55.560]   - But you think about it, with Ross,
[01:57:55.560 --> 01:57:59.660]   I mean, very bright guy, very bright guy.
[01:57:59.660 --> 01:58:02.300]   But think about the amount of cognitive dissonance
[01:58:02.300 --> 01:58:04.760]   that the guy's got that he thinks
[01:58:04.760 --> 01:58:08.300]   he's gonna change the world by running a drug site.
[01:58:08.300 --> 01:58:12.700]   I mean, certainly, I mean, could he have changed the world?
[01:58:12.700 --> 01:58:13.540]   Yeah.
[01:58:13.540 --> 01:58:15.860]   Could he have done it like that?
[01:58:15.860 --> 01:58:17.300]   Probably not.
[01:58:17.300 --> 01:58:19.260]   - Well, I can still mend those arguments.
[01:58:19.260 --> 01:58:22.340]   I listened to quite a few libertarians,
[01:58:22.340 --> 01:58:24.140]   and you can push that to anarchists.
[01:58:24.140 --> 01:58:27.940]   You know, there's a lot of people that argue.
[01:58:27.940 --> 01:58:32.820]   So I actually talked to Professor Columbia,
[01:58:32.820 --> 01:58:35.180]   who actually argues that all drugs should be legalized,
[01:58:35.180 --> 01:58:37.460]   and not at a philosophical level, political level,
[01:58:37.460 --> 01:58:41.340]   but the fact that all the negative consequences of drugs
[01:58:41.340 --> 01:58:44.660]   that people talk about actually have to do
[01:58:44.660 --> 01:58:47.220]   with other factors in your life.
[01:58:47.220 --> 01:58:48.300]   - I would agree with that.
[01:58:48.300 --> 01:58:51.580]   - And so that's a, okay, but that's more like a argument
[01:58:51.580 --> 01:58:53.640]   about negative aspects of drugs.
[01:58:53.640 --> 01:58:56.420]   I think the ideology comes in where it's like,
[01:58:56.420 --> 01:58:59.300]   well, nobody should tell you what to do.
[01:58:59.300 --> 01:59:01.980]   You should be, you should have the responsibility
[01:59:01.980 --> 01:59:03.100]   of your own actions.
[01:59:03.100 --> 01:59:08.700]   The government or any other institution shouldn't be
[01:59:08.700 --> 01:59:14.580]   the rule setters, the constraints for how you live your life.
[01:59:14.580 --> 01:59:17.160]   And so that, I could see that argument being made,
[01:59:17.160 --> 01:59:22.160]   and ultimately if you like create an open market for drugs,
[01:59:22.160 --> 01:59:24.620]   how that could build a better society,
[01:59:24.620 --> 01:59:28.140]   it might break down the outdated, the corrupt,
[01:59:28.140 --> 01:59:29.600]   the bureaucratic institutions.
[01:59:29.600 --> 01:59:31.860]   I mean, you can make that argument.
[01:59:31.860 --> 01:59:33.620]   - There's an argument, and let's be fair.
[01:59:33.620 --> 01:59:34.580]   I wanna be fair with it.
[01:59:34.580 --> 01:59:38.180]   I mean, did he change the world?
[01:59:38.180 --> 01:59:40.540]   We do have this whole thing called cryptocurrency.
[01:59:40.540 --> 01:59:43.060]   - Yeah, in the long arc of history, perhaps.
[01:59:43.060 --> 01:59:44.780]   - Yeah, we do have that.
[01:59:46.060 --> 01:59:46.900]   That's a biggie.
[01:59:46.900 --> 01:59:50.720]   - And that might have been for it to take hold in society,
[01:59:50.720 --> 01:59:52.960]   maybe the darker parts of society at first,
[01:59:52.960 --> 01:59:54.160]   maybe that was necessary.
[01:59:54.160 --> 01:59:55.360]   - Right, I mean, maybe.
[01:59:55.360 --> 01:59:57.320]   I mean, we'll see how it pans out.
[01:59:57.320 --> 02:00:02.320]   Shadow Crew, we had this guy, Albert Gonzalez,
[02:00:02.320 --> 02:00:04.520]   his kid's name.
[02:00:04.520 --> 02:00:06.720]   We had, we were growing so big
[02:00:06.720 --> 02:00:11.240]   that I had to start farming things out.
[02:00:11.240 --> 02:00:12.680]   So the first thing I started farming,
[02:00:12.680 --> 02:00:14.780]   I instituted this review system.
[02:00:15.600 --> 02:00:18.320]   Kind of establishing that trust mechanism
[02:00:18.320 --> 02:00:20.020]   even further for criminals to use.
[02:00:20.020 --> 02:00:24.320]   We needed somebody to take care of our
[02:00:24.320 --> 02:00:25.920]   tech aspects of the forum.
[02:00:25.920 --> 02:00:29.620]   So, an associate of mine by the name of Kim Taylor,
[02:00:29.620 --> 02:00:31.440]   we were looking for a forum techie.
[02:00:31.440 --> 02:00:33.000]   He comes to me one night, and he's like,
[02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:34.240]   "Found our forum techie."
[02:00:34.240 --> 02:00:35.080]   I was like, "Who's that?"
[02:00:35.080 --> 02:00:37.000]   And he's like, "It's this kid."
[02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:38.440]   And I was like, "Is he any good?"
[02:00:38.440 --> 02:00:39.600]   He's like, "Well, he knows the software."
[02:00:39.600 --> 02:00:41.320]   I was like, "Okay."
[02:00:41.320 --> 02:00:43.160]   We just signed his ass on.
[02:00:43.160 --> 02:00:45.620]   He went by the screen name of Kumbajani,
[02:00:45.620 --> 02:00:46.780]   was his screen name.
[02:00:46.780 --> 02:00:49.780]   And he starts selling credit cards after a while
[02:00:49.780 --> 02:00:51.620]   under a screen name of Scarface.
[02:00:51.620 --> 02:00:56.620]   And that CB1 breach, where you're cashing out
[02:00:56.620 --> 02:01:01.200]   the track twos at ATMs, $40,000 a day.
[02:01:01.200 --> 02:01:06.860]   So Albert's in New Jersey one day, broad daylight,
[02:01:06.860 --> 02:01:11.860]   and stands at an ATM for 40 minutes, just standing there,
[02:01:11.940 --> 02:01:14.900]   feeding in one ATM card after another,
[02:01:14.900 --> 02:01:17.600]   pulling out cash, taking the 20s out,
[02:01:17.600 --> 02:01:19.560]   stuffing them in that backpack.
[02:01:19.560 --> 02:01:21.320]   Meanwhile, just across the street,
[02:01:21.320 --> 02:01:23.920]   a couple of cops just happen to be there.
[02:01:23.920 --> 02:01:28.340]   And they start noticing this kid just standing there.
[02:01:28.340 --> 02:01:31.620]   So 40 minutes they watch this kid, 40 minutes.
[02:01:31.620 --> 02:01:33.500]   Finally, one cop looks at the other,
[02:01:33.500 --> 02:01:36.220]   "Let me see what's going on there."
[02:01:36.220 --> 02:01:38.120]   Walks over across the street.
[02:01:38.120 --> 02:01:39.260]   Albert's wearing a wig.
[02:01:39.260 --> 02:01:42.060]   He's got the disguise on, everything else like that.
[02:01:42.060 --> 02:01:43.980]   Asks him, "Kid, what are you doing?"
[02:01:43.980 --> 02:01:45.280]   Albert falls apart.
[02:01:45.280 --> 02:01:48.780]   We didn't know Albert had been arrested.
[02:01:48.780 --> 02:01:51.120]   So Albert immediately goes in,
[02:01:51.120 --> 02:01:53.060]   "I wanna work for the Secret Service."
[02:01:53.060 --> 02:01:57.160]   At that point in time, Secret Service,
[02:01:57.160 --> 02:02:01.780]   I referred to, and I wanna make sure
[02:02:01.780 --> 02:02:04.700]   that I don't say it's not like that anymore.
[02:02:04.700 --> 02:02:07.580]   But back then, they were fucking idiots.
[02:02:07.580 --> 02:02:09.460]   All right, they had no clue what was going on.
[02:02:09.460 --> 02:02:10.940]   - So there was a competence issue
[02:02:10.940 --> 02:02:12.740]   that they were working through, is one way to put it.
[02:02:12.740 --> 02:02:14.820]   - That's a nice euphemism.
[02:02:14.820 --> 02:02:18.980]   We're fucking idiots is another way to say it.
[02:02:18.980 --> 02:02:21.780]   - So they're just like not aware of this digital world.
[02:02:21.780 --> 02:02:23.100]   - They had no clue, no clue.
[02:02:23.100 --> 02:02:26.180]   The way that Albert tells them how to catch us,
[02:02:26.180 --> 02:02:28.660]   because they looked at him, "How do we catch him?"
[02:02:28.660 --> 02:02:32.460]   And Albert's like, "I'm serious, I'm serious."
[02:02:32.460 --> 02:02:35.660]   So Albert's like, "Well, you could try a VPN."
[02:02:35.660 --> 02:02:37.480]   What's a VPN?
[02:02:37.480 --> 02:02:39.760]   So he explains it to them, they're like,
[02:02:39.760 --> 02:02:41.820]   "That's a good idea."
[02:02:41.820 --> 02:02:43.940]   So I quit Shadow Crew.
[02:02:43.940 --> 02:02:45.620]   I was worried about all the news that was coming in
[02:02:45.620 --> 02:02:46.460]   and everything like that.
[02:02:46.460 --> 02:02:47.860]   I'm still in 160K a week.
[02:02:47.860 --> 02:02:49.820]   I didn't know Albert had been arrested.
[02:02:49.820 --> 02:02:52.540]   I'm worried about being arrested.
[02:02:52.540 --> 02:02:54.540]   I know the writing's on the wall,
[02:02:54.540 --> 02:02:56.700]   and I'm like, "I'm quitting."
[02:02:56.700 --> 02:02:58.380]   - Where did you see the writing?
[02:02:58.380 --> 02:03:00.420]   - The IPs that were coming in,
[02:03:00.420 --> 02:03:03.300]   the text messages about the Secret Service investigators
[02:03:03.300 --> 02:03:04.140]   I referred to. - The building,
[02:03:04.140 --> 02:03:05.620]   so the pressure's building, it's not gonna end well.
[02:03:05.620 --> 02:03:07.220]   - Man, this is not gonna end well.
[02:03:07.220 --> 02:03:09.120]   This is going to be bad.
[02:03:09.120 --> 02:03:13.600]   So I announced my retirement of February 15th,
[02:03:13.600 --> 02:03:18.220]   oh, I'm sorry, April 15th, 2004 is my retirement.
[02:03:18.220 --> 02:03:19.900]   I think that's 2004.
[02:03:19.900 --> 02:03:22.720]   And I quit, I walk away.
[02:03:22.720 --> 02:03:24.980]   Well, Albert had been arrested.
[02:03:24.980 --> 02:03:26.220]   They cut him loose.
[02:03:26.220 --> 02:03:27.340]   No one knows he's been arrested.
[02:03:27.340 --> 02:03:29.100]   He comes back into Shadow Crew.
[02:03:29.100 --> 02:03:31.740]   I leave, Kim Taylor at the same time,
[02:03:31.740 --> 02:03:34.540]   he's kind of on the run, which if you wanna know that story,
[02:03:34.540 --> 02:03:36.900]   that's a nightmare story in and of itself.
[02:03:36.900 --> 02:03:40.400]   So my second in charge, Kim Taylor, this guy,
[02:03:40.400 --> 02:03:42.460]   there was this guy named David,
[02:03:42.460 --> 02:03:45.180]   oh, what was his name?
[02:03:45.180 --> 02:03:49.080]   He was, El Mariachi was the guy's name.
[02:03:49.080 --> 02:03:52.480]   David Thomas, David, yeah, yeah, he was a film guy.
[02:03:52.480 --> 02:03:54.940]   - Scarface, yeah, yeah.
[02:03:54.940 --> 02:03:58.420]   - So El Mariachi, real name David Thomas,
[02:03:58.420 --> 02:04:02.460]   he's on the run out of Nebraska for check fraud.
[02:04:02.460 --> 02:04:06.300]   He comes to us on Shadow Crew, telling us this sad story.
[02:04:06.300 --> 02:04:10.600]   We take up a collection for this guy, send it to him.
[02:04:10.600 --> 02:04:13.820]   I get him a job working with a low level carter,
[02:04:13.820 --> 02:04:15.320]   trying to make him some money.
[02:04:15.320 --> 02:04:19.340]   El Mariachi, or Thomas does this for a few weeks,
[02:04:19.340 --> 02:04:20.580]   comes to me one day and he's like,
[02:04:20.580 --> 02:04:22.100]   man, I'm not making any money.
[02:04:22.100 --> 02:04:23.420]   I'm like, okay, let me see what I can do.
[02:04:23.420 --> 02:04:27.140]   Well, I had a Ukrainian guy by the name of Big Buyer.
[02:04:27.140 --> 02:04:30.380]   He, real friend of mine, and I contacted him,
[02:04:30.380 --> 02:04:31.420]   I was like, look, man, I got a guy
[02:04:31.420 --> 02:04:33.020]   that wants to do some work, can you help the guy out?
[02:04:33.020 --> 02:04:33.980]   And he's like, I got it.
[02:04:33.980 --> 02:04:35.140]   I was like, okay.
[02:04:35.140 --> 02:04:38.500]   So he sends Thomas enough money to go,
[02:04:38.500 --> 02:04:40.300]   Thomas is in Texas at that point,
[02:04:40.300 --> 02:04:43.360]   sends Thomas enough money to go from Texas
[02:04:43.360 --> 02:04:47.100]   to Issaquah, Washington, and rent an office space.
[02:04:47.100 --> 02:04:48.540]   All right?
[02:04:48.540 --> 02:04:50.980]   So Thomas goes up there, rents his office space,
[02:04:50.980 --> 02:04:53.560]   him and his girlfriend, rents an office space.
[02:04:53.560 --> 02:04:59.380]   And the plan is, is Big Buyer is going to place an order,
[02:04:59.380 --> 02:05:03.300]   get products sent, Mariachi's going to get the product
[02:05:03.300 --> 02:05:05.620]   listed on eBay, cash out 50/50.
[02:05:05.620 --> 02:05:07.100]   Easy enough, all right?
[02:05:07.100 --> 02:05:09.060]   So Big Buyer places an order.
[02:05:09.060 --> 02:05:11.960]   First order is Outpost.com, $18,000.
[02:05:11.960 --> 02:05:16.320]   The largest order Outpost.com had ever received
[02:05:16.320 --> 02:05:17.420]   at that point in time.
[02:05:17.420 --> 02:05:19.780]   Order goes through.
[02:05:19.780 --> 02:05:20.620]   - It goes through still.
[02:05:20.620 --> 02:05:23.620]   - Goes through, he gets the product, all right?
[02:05:23.620 --> 02:05:25.180]   Mariachi comes back, tells me,
[02:05:25.180 --> 02:05:27.080]   tells my second in charge, Kim Taylor.
[02:05:27.080 --> 02:05:31.100]   Kim Taylor at this point, I'm 33, 34.
[02:05:31.100 --> 02:05:32.520]   Kim Taylor's 46.
[02:05:32.520 --> 02:05:35.000]   He works at the Tattered Cover Bookstore
[02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:37.860]   in Denver, Colorado, is where he works at this point.
[02:05:37.860 --> 02:05:40.740]   And he fancies himself Jason Bourne.
[02:05:40.740 --> 02:05:42.220]   All right, he's even got one of the screen names
[02:05:42.220 --> 02:05:43.720]   of Jason Bourne.
[02:05:43.720 --> 02:05:46.420]   So I'm like, all right, so Mariachi's telling us
[02:05:46.420 --> 02:05:48.300]   how much money he's making and everything else.
[02:05:48.300 --> 02:05:50.360]   I'm like, well, that's good, I'm glad you're all right.
[02:05:50.360 --> 02:05:53.420]   Kim contacts me, he's like, I wanna go to Issaquah.
[02:05:53.420 --> 02:05:54.540]   And I was like, why?
[02:05:54.540 --> 02:05:55.500]   And he's like, to make some money.
[02:05:55.500 --> 02:05:57.140]   I'm like, you're making money.
[02:05:57.140 --> 02:05:58.660]   He's like, I wanna go to Issaquah.
[02:05:58.660 --> 02:06:00.820]   I was like, all right, go, be careful.
[02:06:00.820 --> 02:06:03.020]   So he gets in the car.
[02:06:03.020 --> 02:06:04.580]   Saturn is what he's driving.
[02:06:04.580 --> 02:06:06.900]   He drives his little piece of shit Saturn
[02:06:06.900 --> 02:06:08.480]   all the way up to Issaquah.
[02:06:08.480 --> 02:06:10.700]   Gets there, you know, midnight.
[02:06:10.700 --> 02:06:12.540]   They party all night long
[02:06:12.540 --> 02:06:14.300]   because they've never met each other.
[02:06:14.300 --> 02:06:16.200]   They're just celebrating, partying, drinking,
[02:06:16.200 --> 02:06:17.780]   everything else like that.
[02:06:17.780 --> 02:06:22.340]   Meanwhile, Big Buyer has placed another order
[02:06:22.340 --> 02:06:27.240]   with Outpost.com, $17,000.
[02:06:27.240 --> 02:06:30.040]   The second largest order Outpost.com
[02:06:30.040 --> 02:06:33.480]   had ever received at that point in time.
[02:06:33.480 --> 02:06:34.520]   By this point in time,
[02:06:34.520 --> 02:06:37.080]   Outpost knows the first order was fraudulent.
[02:06:37.080 --> 02:06:38.200]   Guess where it's going?
[02:06:38.200 --> 02:06:41.200]   The exact same address the first order goes.
[02:06:41.200 --> 02:06:44.200]   So Outpost picks up the phone, calls Issaquah PD.
[02:06:44.200 --> 02:06:46.560]   Hey, we got a fraudster.
[02:06:46.560 --> 02:06:51.320]   Issaquah's like, would you mind sending some empty boxes?
[02:06:51.320 --> 02:06:54.440]   And Outpost is like, be happy to.
[02:06:54.440 --> 02:06:58.280]   So the rule was, is on credit card fraud,
[02:06:58.280 --> 02:07:01.920]   if you've got full account access, you place the order.
[02:07:01.920 --> 02:07:03.720]   The morning it's supposed to arrive,
[02:07:03.720 --> 02:07:06.240]   you sign into the bank account or the credit card account.
[02:07:06.240 --> 02:07:09.200]   If you can sign in, you go pick up your product.
[02:07:09.200 --> 02:07:12.480]   If you can't sign in, you go back to sleep that day.
[02:07:12.480 --> 02:07:13.760]   All right?
[02:07:13.760 --> 02:07:16.360]   Well, Big Buyer was the guy who placed the order.
[02:07:16.360 --> 02:07:19.960]   Mariachi and my second in charge are partying.
[02:07:19.960 --> 02:07:20.800]   All right?
[02:07:20.800 --> 02:07:22.980]   So they're supposed to contact Big Buyer.
[02:07:22.980 --> 02:07:24.320]   They don't.
[02:07:24.320 --> 02:07:26.920]   Meanwhile, Big Buyer is raising hell,
[02:07:26.920 --> 02:07:31.200]   getting up with me like, hey, where are the guys?
[02:07:31.200 --> 02:07:32.280]   I can't find them.
[02:07:32.280 --> 02:07:34.400]   They don't need to pick up this product.
[02:07:34.400 --> 02:07:36.320]   So I can't get in touch with them.
[02:07:36.320 --> 02:07:37.440]   They go down to pick up the...
[02:07:37.440 --> 02:07:41.440]   So Mariachi's got a Cadillac, old '70s Cadillac.
[02:07:41.440 --> 02:07:45.600]   He's got a Cadillac, pulls into the complex.
[02:07:45.600 --> 02:07:47.500]   Now, Mariachi's driving.
[02:07:47.500 --> 02:07:51.600]   Kim Taylor's in the passenger seat.
[02:07:51.600 --> 02:07:54.160]   David Thomas's girlfriend's in the backseat.
[02:07:54.160 --> 02:07:55.840]   As they pull into the complex,
[02:07:55.840 --> 02:07:57.560]   going through the parking lot,
[02:07:57.560 --> 02:08:00.600]   Mariachi just happens to glance over and he sees a van
[02:08:00.600 --> 02:08:03.000]   with a guy sitting sideways in the van.
[02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:05.660]   And he looks at Kim Taylor and he's like,
[02:08:05.660 --> 02:08:07.840]   that's an undercover.
[02:08:07.840 --> 02:08:10.480]   And Kim's like, ah, it's fine.
[02:08:10.480 --> 02:08:13.600]   So they pull up to the office complex.
[02:08:13.600 --> 02:08:16.720]   Kim's like, I'll go in and get the packages.
[02:08:16.720 --> 02:08:19.640]   So he walks in, looks at the guy behind the counter.
[02:08:19.640 --> 02:08:21.240]   I believe you have some packages for us.
[02:08:21.240 --> 02:08:23.440]   Guy's like, one second.
[02:08:23.440 --> 02:08:26.120]   So he disappears around the wall,
[02:08:26.120 --> 02:08:29.760]   out pops the Issaquah PD, arrest Kim.
[02:08:29.760 --> 02:08:32.480]   David Thomas is in the car watching all this happen.
[02:08:32.480 --> 02:08:37.000]   He bugs out and they arrest him on the interstate
[02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:40.240]   where he has three fake driver's licenses in his wallet
[02:08:40.240 --> 02:08:43.180]   along with his real driver's license, another no-no,
[02:08:43.180 --> 02:08:44.180]   but they get him.
[02:08:44.180 --> 02:08:48.140]   So David Thomas had outstanding warrants out of Nebraska.
[02:08:48.140 --> 02:08:50.160]   We couldn't bond him out.
[02:08:50.160 --> 02:08:53.840]   Kim Taylor didn't have any warrants, so we bonded him out.
[02:08:53.840 --> 02:08:59.920]   My third in charge, Kidd, Seth Sanders was his name.
[02:08:59.920 --> 02:09:02.620]   He bonds him out, uses his girlfriend's account
[02:09:02.620 --> 02:09:03.480]   to bond him out.
[02:09:03.480 --> 02:09:08.480]   And I get Kim Taylor to go to Utah
[02:09:08.480 --> 02:09:13.520]   where another friend of mine agrees to house him,
[02:09:13.520 --> 02:09:15.200]   him and his wife.
[02:09:15.200 --> 02:09:17.360]   So I think everything's fine and all that.
[02:09:18.680 --> 02:09:21.400]   About three weeks later, this guy in Utah
[02:09:21.400 --> 02:09:24.440]   gets me on the phone, "Hey, he's gotta go."
[02:09:24.440 --> 02:09:25.280]   (laughing)
[02:09:25.280 --> 02:09:27.520]   And I'm like, "What's going on?"
[02:09:27.520 --> 02:09:30.480]   He's like, "Well, the only thing he's doing
[02:09:30.480 --> 02:09:33.840]   "is popping ecstasy tablets every day, all day."
[02:09:33.840 --> 02:09:35.200]   And I'm like, "Seriously?"
[02:09:35.200 --> 02:09:36.020]   He's like, "Yeah."
[02:09:36.020 --> 02:09:37.120]   I was like, "Okay, he's gotta go."
[02:09:37.120 --> 02:09:38.860]   So we kick him out of there.
[02:09:38.860 --> 02:09:40.620]   By this point, I've got another crew that's coming through.
[02:09:40.620 --> 02:09:42.440]   I mean, I had all these crews running.
[02:09:42.440 --> 02:09:45.360]   Had another crew that's coming through Denver,
[02:09:45.360 --> 02:09:49.040]   send Kim back to Denver to partner up with these guys.
[02:09:49.040 --> 02:09:52.060]   Kim gets these guys arrested.
[02:09:52.060 --> 02:09:54.800]   So by this point in time, I'm exasperated.
[02:09:54.800 --> 02:09:57.940]   I just wanna throw my hands up in the air and walk away.
[02:09:57.940 --> 02:10:00.720]   So my retirement's coming up at the same time.
[02:10:00.720 --> 02:10:03.680]   So I'm like, "Fuck it, I'm done."
[02:10:03.680 --> 02:10:06.120]   So I tell everybody, the rest of the admins
[02:10:06.120 --> 02:10:07.920]   and the mods there, I'm like, "This is what's going on.
[02:10:07.920 --> 02:10:09.380]   "You guys need to watch out for this.
[02:10:09.380 --> 02:10:11.880]   "We need to ban Kim, not let him back in.
[02:10:11.880 --> 02:10:13.400]   "Be careful what's going on."
[02:10:13.400 --> 02:10:15.220]   I walk away.
[02:10:15.220 --> 02:10:17.860]   At the same time I walk away,
[02:10:17.860 --> 02:10:20.900]   Kumbajani, Albert Gonzalez, comes back into play.
[02:10:20.900 --> 02:10:22.560]   He sees everything that's going on.
[02:10:22.560 --> 02:10:24.100]   He uses that to his advantage.
[02:10:24.100 --> 02:10:26.860]   He starts banning everyone that's suspicious of him.
[02:10:26.860 --> 02:10:29.200]   Sets up the VPN at the same time and says,
[02:10:29.200 --> 02:10:31.440]   "Hey, to make sure we're all secure,
[02:10:31.440 --> 02:10:34.880]   "I need all transactions to go through this VPN."
[02:10:34.880 --> 02:10:37.580]   VPNs ran by the Secret Service.
[02:10:37.580 --> 02:10:38.420]   All right?
[02:10:38.420 --> 02:10:40.540]   Secret Service ends up, I think they ended up cataloging
[02:10:40.540 --> 02:10:42.520]   like $7 million worth of transactions
[02:10:42.520 --> 02:10:45.160]   over the next four or five months.
[02:10:45.160 --> 02:10:49.780]   Shadow Crew makes the front cover of Forbes, August 2004.
[02:10:49.780 --> 02:10:52.600]   Headline, "Who's Stealing Your Identity?"
[02:10:52.600 --> 02:10:56.740]   October 26, 2004, United States Secret Service arrest,
[02:10:56.740 --> 02:11:00.360]   33 people, six countries, six hours.
[02:11:00.360 --> 02:11:02.860]   I was in Charleston, South Carolina when I saw it happen.
[02:11:02.860 --> 02:11:05.740]   And I'm like, (laughs)
[02:11:05.740 --> 02:11:08.460]   - So you're the one that got away.
[02:11:08.460 --> 02:11:10.260]   - I'm the one public, there were a couple other guys
[02:11:10.260 --> 02:11:12.480]   that got away that they didn't publicly mention.
[02:11:12.480 --> 02:11:14.980]   One, his name was Tron.
[02:11:14.980 --> 02:11:16.060]   He was a--
[02:11:16.060 --> 02:11:17.060]   - Zero?
[02:11:17.060 --> 02:11:18.140]   - Yeah, exactly.
[02:11:18.140 --> 02:11:20.980]   But he went by the screen name Tron.
[02:11:20.980 --> 02:11:24.200]   He had access, almost unfettered access,
[02:11:24.200 --> 02:11:25.320]   to Bank of America.
[02:11:25.320 --> 02:11:29.580]   So what happens is they identified the guy,
[02:11:29.580 --> 02:11:31.800]   Secret Service is in the air to go get him.
[02:11:31.800 --> 02:11:33.340]   They call the Ukrainian police.
[02:11:33.340 --> 02:11:34.820]   "Hey, we're coming down to arrest this guy."
[02:11:34.820 --> 02:11:37.980]   Ukrainian cops are like, "Oh, come on down."
[02:11:37.980 --> 02:11:39.300]   So as soon as they got off the phone,
[02:11:39.300 --> 02:11:42.300]   Ukrainian cops get in the car, go down and tell Tron,
[02:11:42.300 --> 02:11:44.500]   "Hey, they're coming to get ya."
[02:11:44.500 --> 02:11:45.340]   - Yeah.
[02:11:45.340 --> 02:11:47.780]   - (laughs) So he bugs out down to South America
[02:11:47.780 --> 02:11:48.860]   and they don't catch him, I think,
[02:11:48.860 --> 02:11:51.220]   for six or seven years after that, something like that.
[02:11:51.220 --> 02:11:52.660]   - But caught him eventually.
[02:11:52.660 --> 02:11:53.500]   - Caught him eventually.
[02:11:53.500 --> 02:11:55.740]   - Well, let me actually ask you on this point.
[02:11:55.740 --> 02:11:58.900]   You've said that if you do cybercrime,
[02:11:58.900 --> 02:12:00.860]   eventually it's not gonna end well.
[02:12:00.860 --> 02:12:02.220]   - It does not end well.
[02:12:02.220 --> 02:12:03.780]   - Why is that?
[02:12:03.780 --> 02:12:05.460]   - So I don't wanna say that's because
[02:12:05.460 --> 02:12:06.300]   you're gonna be arrested,
[02:12:06.300 --> 02:12:10.220]   because honestly, very few people are arrested, all right?
[02:12:10.220 --> 02:12:13.420]   But it doesn't end well because of the type of person
[02:12:13.420 --> 02:12:14.860]   that you become.
[02:12:14.860 --> 02:12:20.700]   You quoted me earlier, you lie to everybody around you.
[02:12:20.700 --> 02:12:23.340]   You lie to yourself, you lie to your friends,
[02:12:23.340 --> 02:12:25.780]   you lie to your family, of course you lie to your victims.
[02:12:25.780 --> 02:12:27.940]   You don't have any friends.
[02:12:27.940 --> 02:12:30.860]   I went 20 years without friends.
[02:12:30.860 --> 02:12:33.500]   I had associates, I didn't have friends.
[02:12:33.500 --> 02:12:35.300]   - And you can't truly trust anybody.
[02:12:35.300 --> 02:12:36.700]   - You don't trust anybody.
[02:12:36.700 --> 02:12:37.900]   You don't trust anybody.
[02:12:37.900 --> 02:12:41.640]   I had my wife, I was married for nine years.
[02:12:42.620 --> 02:12:46.220]   I lied to her every single day of those nine years.
[02:12:46.220 --> 02:12:49.740]   And it took her nine years to give up on me,
[02:12:49.740 --> 02:12:52.540]   to realize that I was that piece of shit.
[02:12:52.540 --> 02:12:55.540]   And she leaves at that point.
[02:12:55.540 --> 02:12:58.300]   Then from there, I started dating a stripper
[02:12:58.300 --> 02:12:59.940]   and lied to her.
[02:12:59.940 --> 02:13:02.020]   I thought I had friends, I lied to all those people
[02:13:02.020 --> 02:13:04.780]   that I knew that thought they were my friends.
[02:13:04.780 --> 02:13:06.980]   I lied to them the entire time.
[02:13:06.980 --> 02:13:08.820]   You become that individual.
[02:13:09.720 --> 02:13:12.020]   I don't think a lot of people really understand
[02:13:12.020 --> 02:13:14.240]   how bad that is.
[02:13:14.240 --> 02:13:17.240]   You know, you talked about, you pointed out that woman
[02:13:17.240 --> 02:13:19.720]   that I ripped off, she was trying to put a roof
[02:13:19.720 --> 02:13:22.040]   on her house for her friggin' kids, man.
[02:13:22.040 --> 02:13:24.880]   You're that person, you're that person.
[02:13:24.880 --> 02:13:27.460]   - So you're also lying to yourself.
[02:13:27.460 --> 02:13:32.560]   And that's not a mindset in which you can
[02:13:32.560 --> 02:13:38.540]   grow as a person, find happiness,
[02:13:38.540 --> 02:13:41.080]   find genuine, simple human affection,
[02:13:41.080 --> 02:13:42.960]   which is what love is.
[02:13:42.960 --> 02:13:46.160]   Simple, real friendship, all of those things.
[02:13:46.160 --> 02:13:48.360]   - So I went to prison, of course.
[02:13:48.360 --> 02:13:50.600]   One of the most important lessons
[02:13:50.600 --> 02:13:52.580]   that I've learned in prison,
[02:13:52.580 --> 02:13:54.480]   because cyber crime, crime as a whole,
[02:13:54.480 --> 02:13:56.960]   if you're a criminal, it's an addiction.
[02:13:56.960 --> 02:13:57.960]   If you're addicted to something,
[02:13:57.960 --> 02:14:00.520]   whether it be drugs, crime, gambling, what have you,
[02:14:00.520 --> 02:14:01.760]   if you're addicted to something,
[02:14:01.760 --> 02:14:05.880]   you cannot love anything else except the addiction.
[02:14:05.880 --> 02:14:07.920]   The addiction comes first.
[02:14:08.260 --> 02:14:11.200]   All right, and you pointed out some of those
[02:14:11.200 --> 02:14:12.680]   truly despicable things.
[02:14:12.680 --> 02:14:16.060]   Scripps, for example, tortures that guy.
[02:14:16.060 --> 02:14:18.020]   You get to the point where it's like,
[02:14:18.020 --> 02:14:20.540]   okay, this is the business.
[02:14:20.540 --> 02:14:25.420]   And I tried to convince myself that I'm a businessman,
[02:14:25.420 --> 02:14:27.160]   but I'm a good guy on the other end.
[02:14:27.160 --> 02:14:28.640]   And you're not, you're not.
[02:14:28.640 --> 02:14:32.140]   So those lies become part of it, everything else.
[02:14:32.140 --> 02:14:37.040]   Yeah, you get the higher-ups are usually arrested,
[02:14:37.040 --> 02:14:38.600]   they are, but you've got millions
[02:14:38.600 --> 02:14:40.320]   of cyber criminals these days.
[02:14:40.320 --> 02:14:43.120]   So most guys are not gonna be arrested.
[02:14:43.120 --> 02:14:45.000]   So you may be arrested,
[02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:49.520]   you may be like freaking Jonathan James.
[02:14:49.520 --> 02:14:54.320]   He was a miner, a very talented individual, very competent.
[02:14:54.320 --> 02:14:59.080]   He had, as a kid, he had broke into NASA, DOD, Pentagon.
[02:14:59.080 --> 02:15:01.520]   He shut the NASA computers down for six weeks.
[02:15:01.520 --> 02:15:03.500]   This is that kid.
[02:15:03.500 --> 02:15:06.140]   Then he decides he wants to go into credit card theft,
[02:15:06.140 --> 02:15:08.540]   partners with Albert, he's arrested with Albert.
[02:15:08.540 --> 02:15:13.240]   Law enforcement, they were gonna blame him.
[02:15:13.240 --> 02:15:15.980]   He was the only competent individual.
[02:15:15.980 --> 02:15:19.280]   So this kid gets up one day, he wasn't in prison yet.
[02:15:19.280 --> 02:15:21.220]   He gets up one day, goes in his dad's bedroom,
[02:15:21.220 --> 02:15:24.320]   gets out his 45, walks in the bathroom,
[02:15:24.320 --> 02:15:26.580]   and blows his brains out.
[02:15:26.580 --> 02:15:28.960]   You know, you've got things like that.
[02:15:28.960 --> 02:15:31.240]   Or you're gonna rip somebody off,
[02:15:31.240 --> 02:15:32.960]   and you're gonna end up like Scripps did with that guy,
[02:15:32.960 --> 02:15:37.260]   the guy who ran Evolution Marketplace.
[02:15:37.260 --> 02:15:40.760]   No one knew who, two people ran that, a guy and a girl.
[02:15:40.760 --> 02:15:42.820]   And no one knew who they were.
[02:15:42.820 --> 02:15:45.060]   He ends up stealing about $24 million,
[02:15:45.060 --> 02:15:46.860]   a lot of it from Ukrainian mob,
[02:15:46.860 --> 02:15:48.760]   and they found him about a year later
[02:15:48.760 --> 02:15:51.140]   on a beach without his head in hands.
[02:15:51.140 --> 02:15:53.340]   But, you know, it always goes south.
[02:15:53.340 --> 02:15:54.860]   But more than anything, to me,
[02:15:54.860 --> 02:15:59.540]   the negative thing is you really become somebody
[02:16:01.540 --> 02:16:05.720]   that, I mean, just truly a despicable human being.
[02:16:05.720 --> 02:16:07.360]   When you get to the point
[02:16:07.360 --> 02:16:11.960]   when you're destroying people's retirement accounts,
[02:16:11.960 --> 02:16:13.360]   you're stealing money from a woman
[02:16:13.360 --> 02:16:18.240]   that simply wants to do something good for her family.
[02:16:18.240 --> 02:16:20.560]   When you become that individual,
[02:16:20.560 --> 02:16:23.240]   and you're okay with that, my God, man.
[02:16:23.240 --> 02:16:26.360]   I got to the point, I had one guy ripped off,
[02:16:26.360 --> 02:16:27.600]   it's like for $900,
[02:16:27.600 --> 02:16:29.920]   this is when I first started the cybercrime stuff.
[02:16:29.920 --> 02:16:31.960]   This is when I was becoming competent.
[02:16:31.960 --> 02:16:35.540]   And I ripped him off for like $900,
[02:16:35.540 --> 02:16:37.460]   and he sent me an email.
[02:16:37.460 --> 02:16:42.460]   And he was like, the email said something like,
[02:16:42.460 --> 02:16:47.600]   "I guess you needed the money, and it's okay.
[02:16:47.600 --> 02:16:48.860]   "You know, you keep it."
[02:16:48.860 --> 02:16:51.820]   And I'm getting chills right now thinking about it,
[02:16:51.820 --> 02:16:56.820]   but it's that, where you become that individual,
[02:16:56.820 --> 02:16:58.820]   and you become that person.
[02:16:58.820 --> 02:17:00.220]   And I'm like, I'm not gonna lie,
[02:17:00.220 --> 02:17:01.420]   I'm not gonna lie to you,
[02:17:01.420 --> 02:17:02.500]   I'm not gonna lie to you,
[02:17:02.500 --> 02:17:03.340]   I'm not gonna lie to you,
[02:17:03.340 --> 02:17:04.180]   I'm not gonna lie to you,
[02:17:04.180 --> 02:17:05.000]   I'm not gonna lie to you,
[02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:05.840]   I'm not gonna lie to you,
[02:17:05.840 --> 02:17:06.680]   I'm not gonna lie to you,
[02:17:06.680 --> 02:17:07.500]   I'm not gonna lie to you,
[02:17:07.500 --> 02:17:08.340]   I'm not gonna lie to you,
[02:17:08.340 --> 02:17:09.180]   I'm not gonna lie to you,
[02:17:09.180 --> 02:17:10.000]   I'm not gonna lie to you,
[02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:10.840]   I'm not gonna lie to you,
[02:17:10.840 --> 02:17:11.680]   I'm not gonna lie to you,
[02:17:11.680 --> 02:17:12.500]   I'm not gonna lie to you,
[02:17:12.500 --> 02:17:13.340]   I'm not gonna lie to you,
[02:17:13.340 --> 02:17:14.180]   I'm not gonna lie to you,
[02:17:14.180 --> 02:17:15.000]   I'm not gonna lie to you,
[02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:15.840]   I'm not gonna lie to you,
[02:17:15.840 --> 02:17:16.680]   I'm not gonna lie to you,
[02:17:16.680 --> 02:17:21.680]   I'm not gonna lie to you.
[02:17:21.680 --> 02:17:23.720]   - "True Romance" by the way, great movie.
[02:17:23.720 --> 02:17:24.920]   - It is a great film.
[02:17:24.920 --> 02:17:26.640]   It's truly a great film.
[02:17:26.640 --> 02:17:31.080]   - Even Brad Pitt, who makes a brief appearance, is genius.
[02:17:31.080 --> 02:17:32.840]   There's so much good acting there.
[02:17:32.840 --> 02:17:35.760]   Anyway, so tell me that love story.
[02:17:35.760 --> 02:17:37.480]   - All right, so you know what,
[02:17:37.480 --> 02:17:39.560]   like I said, from my dad,
[02:17:39.560 --> 02:17:41.640]   I get that fear of being abandoned.
[02:17:41.640 --> 02:17:45.500]   You know, I lied to my wife for nine years until she leaves.
[02:17:45.500 --> 02:17:48.040]   And I was in Charleston, South Carolina.
[02:17:48.040 --> 02:17:51.880]   Man, what happened was I noticed that Susan,
[02:17:51.880 --> 02:17:56.120]   she was not coming to bed like she used to.
[02:17:56.120 --> 02:17:57.500]   She'd stay up all night long,
[02:17:57.500 --> 02:18:01.400]   and sometimes she'd go and be gone a few hours
[02:18:01.400 --> 02:18:02.240]   and everything else.
[02:18:02.240 --> 02:18:03.400]   And I'm like, "Well, something's going on."
[02:18:03.400 --> 02:18:05.520]   And I'd pass by her computer
[02:18:05.520 --> 02:18:07.000]   and she would minimize the screens.
[02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:08.800]   And I'm like, "Well, gotta figure out
[02:18:08.800 --> 02:18:10.880]   "what the hell's going on."
[02:18:10.880 --> 02:18:13.400]   So put a key logger on her system.
[02:18:13.400 --> 02:18:17.160]   - As anybody should in a relationship.
[02:18:17.160 --> 02:18:19.760]   - Absolutely, 'cause you trust 'em, you know.
[02:18:19.760 --> 02:18:20.600]   Why not?
[02:18:20.600 --> 02:18:22.320]   - You should be tracking all their movements,
[02:18:22.320 --> 02:18:23.160]   all their touching.
[02:18:23.160 --> 02:18:24.160]   - Exactly, exactly.
[02:18:24.160 --> 02:18:26.720]   Like I said, I was the control freak too.
[02:18:26.720 --> 02:18:29.520]   So I found out she'd been cheating on me.
[02:18:29.520 --> 02:18:30.360]   And she was--
[02:18:30.360 --> 02:18:31.920]   - See, there you go, they had a reason.
[02:18:31.920 --> 02:18:33.960]   - They had a reason, I justified.
[02:18:33.960 --> 02:18:35.320]   So I found out she was cheating on me.
[02:18:35.320 --> 02:18:36.760]   She was asleep when I found it out.
[02:18:36.760 --> 02:18:40.000]   And I sat there looking at it and I was like, "Well, shit."
[02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.120]   So got up, walked in the bedroom,
[02:18:42.120 --> 02:18:45.120]   opened up the wardrobe, got a suitcase out,
[02:18:45.120 --> 02:18:46.680]   started putting her clothes in it.
[02:18:46.680 --> 02:18:48.320]   And she wakes up, she's like, "Where are you going?"
[02:18:48.320 --> 02:18:51.360]   I'm like, "I'm not, you are."
[02:18:51.360 --> 02:18:54.680]   Well, my bravado disappeared pretty quickly.
[02:18:54.680 --> 02:18:59.680]   I took about a week of both of us crying and arguing
[02:18:59.680 --> 02:19:01.360]   and everything else.
[02:19:01.360 --> 02:19:03.640]   And she finally left.
[02:19:03.640 --> 02:19:06.400]   And I went through this depression.
[02:19:06.400 --> 02:19:09.440]   I went, I was in Charleston, South Carolina.
[02:19:09.440 --> 02:19:10.480]   I would just walk around the house
[02:19:10.480 --> 02:19:12.960]   kind of stumbling in a daze.
[02:19:12.960 --> 02:19:15.200]   Realized I was getting suicidal
[02:19:15.200 --> 02:19:18.440]   and was smart enough to do something about it.
[02:19:18.440 --> 02:19:19.840]   And picked up the phone book.
[02:19:19.840 --> 02:19:22.680]   And that's where there's always this sense of humor.
[02:19:22.680 --> 02:19:23.520]   So I picked up the phone book
[02:19:23.520 --> 02:19:24.720]   and I'm going through the yellow pages.
[02:19:24.720 --> 02:19:27.240]   I'm like, "Psychologist, criminal psychologist,
[02:19:27.240 --> 02:19:28.360]   'cause I need that."
[02:19:28.360 --> 02:19:30.320]   (both laughing)
[02:19:30.320 --> 02:19:32.200]   Called the psychologist, crying to her.
[02:19:32.200 --> 02:19:33.720]   I mean, crying on the phone, told her everything.
[02:19:33.720 --> 02:19:35.360]   I'm this criminal, this is what's happened.
[02:19:35.360 --> 02:19:36.760]   She's like, "Come in now."
[02:19:36.760 --> 02:19:39.000]   So I go in, spill my guts,
[02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:42.280]   and saw her for about four months.
[02:19:42.280 --> 02:19:43.480]   And I joke about it, but it's true.
[02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:47.440]   She was trying to get me to stop breaking the law
[02:19:47.440 --> 02:19:48.880]   and to go into real estate.
[02:19:48.880 --> 02:19:51.080]   And I remember telling her, "Is there a difference?"
[02:19:51.080 --> 02:19:52.000]   (both laughing)
[02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.640]   She was like, "Yes, there's a difference."
[02:19:54.640 --> 02:19:56.000]   So saw her for about four months.
[02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.040]   I was 34.
[02:19:58.040 --> 02:20:02.200]   I didn't start drinking until I was 34.
[02:20:02.200 --> 02:20:04.640]   I'd never done drugs, anything else like that.
[02:20:04.640 --> 02:20:07.040]   'Cause my mom was an addict as well.
[02:20:07.040 --> 02:20:09.720]   So I was this guy that always wanted to be in control.
[02:20:09.720 --> 02:20:13.520]   Didn't wanna lose control of myself.
[02:20:13.520 --> 02:20:15.840]   And had never been to strip club.
[02:20:15.840 --> 02:20:19.560]   So one night I was getting lonely.
[02:20:19.560 --> 02:20:20.800]   So I walked into the strip club.
[02:20:20.800 --> 02:20:22.400]   Actually, I was researching this strip club.
[02:20:22.400 --> 02:20:26.720]   It was Joe's Roundup in Charleston, South Carolina.
[02:20:26.720 --> 02:20:28.520]   - Joe's Roundup. - Joe's Roundup.
[02:20:28.520 --> 02:20:30.280]   Little bitty hole in the wall stuff.
[02:20:30.280 --> 02:20:32.320]   I was, yeah, real classy.
[02:20:32.320 --> 02:20:36.640]   So I walked in, and I'm literally that guy, man,
[02:20:36.640 --> 02:20:38.760]   that fell in love with the first,
[02:20:38.760 --> 02:20:41.440]   the first stripper that he sees.
[02:20:41.440 --> 02:20:44.400]   She walks by, I'm like, "That one?"
[02:20:44.400 --> 02:20:46.200]   So I didn't know the strip club game.
[02:20:46.200 --> 02:20:48.320]   Again, criminal, naive as hell.
[02:20:48.320 --> 02:20:52.440]   So belly up at the bar, order the beer.
[02:20:52.440 --> 02:20:54.400]   I'm sitting there drinking it.
[02:20:54.400 --> 02:20:57.800]   She comes over to me, and we start talking.
[02:20:57.800 --> 02:21:01.000]   And she's like, "Would you like to get a bottle of champagne?"
[02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:03.160]   I was like, "Does that mean going in back or what?"
[02:21:03.160 --> 02:21:04.880]   She's like, "Well, yeah, you need to do the bottle
[02:21:04.880 --> 02:21:05.720]   to go in back."
[02:21:05.720 --> 02:21:08.000]   I'm like, "Sure, let's buy a bottle of champagne.
[02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:10.400]   $400 bottle of Corbel."
[02:21:10.400 --> 02:21:11.240]   - Wow.
[02:21:11.240 --> 02:21:13.280]   - So I'm like, "All right."
[02:21:13.280 --> 02:21:15.440]   So then again, that bravado disappears pretty quickly.
[02:21:15.440 --> 02:21:18.840]   I get back there, and we talk for two hours.
[02:21:18.840 --> 02:21:21.160]   And nowadays, I understand that most men
[02:21:21.160 --> 02:21:22.840]   who go to strip clubs,
[02:21:22.840 --> 02:21:25.960]   strippers are their therapist most of the time, all right?
[02:21:25.960 --> 02:21:27.800]   So I'm sitting there talking, we're talking.
[02:21:27.800 --> 02:21:29.600]   And of course, she's sizing me up.
[02:21:29.600 --> 02:21:30.600]   She's looking at the watch.
[02:21:30.600 --> 02:21:32.440]   She's like, "What kind of car you drive?"
[02:21:32.440 --> 02:21:33.760]   (laughs)
[02:21:33.760 --> 02:21:35.160]   Everything else, and I'm like,
[02:21:35.160 --> 02:21:36.640]   telling her and talking.
[02:21:36.640 --> 02:21:38.040]   So at the end of the night, I'm like,
[02:21:38.040 --> 02:21:39.080]   "Really nice meeting you."
[02:21:39.080 --> 02:21:41.880]   She's like, "It's so nice meeting you too."
[02:21:41.880 --> 02:21:42.920]   So I leave.
[02:21:42.920 --> 02:21:45.280]   - You guys just talked.
[02:21:45.280 --> 02:21:46.120]   - Just talked.
[02:21:46.120 --> 02:21:48.800]   - And there's no damp feeling of love and all that.
[02:21:48.800 --> 02:21:51.120]   - Yeah, so just talked, just got along pretty good.
[02:21:51.120 --> 02:21:54.240]   I'm like, "I like her, I like her."
[02:21:54.240 --> 02:21:56.960]   So come back in a week later,
[02:21:56.960 --> 02:21:59.480]   walk in and call her over.
[02:21:59.480 --> 02:22:01.680]   And I was like, "Look," I said, "I'm not,
[02:22:01.680 --> 02:22:03.320]   I said, "That was my first time to a strip club."
[02:22:03.320 --> 02:22:04.800]   I said, "Don't know you, I like you.
[02:22:04.800 --> 02:22:05.800]   I'd like to know you more.
[02:22:05.800 --> 02:22:07.840]   Would you like to go out to dinner?"
[02:22:07.840 --> 02:22:10.160]   And she was like, "Yeah."
[02:22:10.160 --> 02:22:11.960]   I was like, "Where would you like to go?"
[02:22:11.960 --> 02:22:13.800]   So she says, "Rue de Jon."
[02:22:13.800 --> 02:22:15.560]   And I was like, "Don't know what it is?
[02:22:15.560 --> 02:22:16.400]   That's where we'll go."
[02:22:16.400 --> 02:22:17.880]   So I go back and I was,
[02:22:17.880 --> 02:22:19.560]   I had a theater buddy at that point in time
[02:22:19.560 --> 02:22:21.080]   'cause I was trying to get my life,
[02:22:21.080 --> 02:22:23.120]   yeah, trying to get my life together.
[02:22:23.120 --> 02:22:24.400]   JC was his name.
[02:22:24.400 --> 02:22:25.560]   And I was like, "I got a date."
[02:22:25.560 --> 02:22:26.760]   And he's like, "You got a date?"
[02:22:26.760 --> 02:22:27.880]   I was like, "Yeah, man, I got a date."
[02:22:27.880 --> 02:22:30.400]   And he's like, "Okay, where are you going?"
[02:22:30.400 --> 02:22:31.480]   I was like, "Rue de Jon."
[02:22:31.480 --> 02:22:33.360]   And he's like, "Take your wallet."
[02:22:33.360 --> 02:22:34.560]   (laughs)
[02:22:34.560 --> 02:22:35.400]   I'm like, "Yeah."
[02:22:35.400 --> 02:22:37.600]   And he's like, "Take your wallet."
[02:22:37.600 --> 02:22:38.920]   I was like, "All right."
[02:22:38.920 --> 02:22:43.680]   So we start doing the lunch and the dinner thing.
[02:22:43.680 --> 02:22:46.760]   And I get to where I really like her.
[02:22:46.760 --> 02:22:51.840]   I was 34, she was 23, and got along really well.
[02:22:51.840 --> 02:22:55.440]   Listened, had common interest in music and arts
[02:22:55.440 --> 02:22:56.480]   and stuff like that.
[02:22:56.480 --> 02:22:58.560]   She had, I mean, it's stereotypical.
[02:22:58.560 --> 02:23:01.200]   She had graduated college
[02:23:01.200 --> 02:23:04.560]   with a degree in religious studies.
[02:23:04.560 --> 02:23:05.400]   - Wow.
[02:23:05.400 --> 02:23:06.400]   - Yeah.
[02:23:06.400 --> 02:23:07.800]   So I was like, "All right."
[02:23:07.800 --> 02:23:09.960]   - So yeah, you just fell in love.
[02:23:09.960 --> 02:23:12.640]   - Yeah, we got along really well, really well.
[02:23:12.640 --> 02:23:14.600]   So I ended up moving her in with me.
[02:23:14.600 --> 02:23:16.440]   She hadn't quit her job.
[02:23:16.440 --> 02:23:21.440]   And what was happening was she was working weekends
[02:23:21.440 --> 02:23:25.320]   and the club would close at three or four.
[02:23:25.320 --> 02:23:30.240]   She wouldn't come home until 10 or 11 in the morning.
[02:23:30.240 --> 02:23:32.840]   And most of the time it would be a phone call
[02:23:32.840 --> 02:23:35.920]   saying, "Come and pick me up, I can't drive home."
[02:23:35.920 --> 02:23:39.720]   And then I'd never used drugs, had never been around.
[02:23:39.720 --> 02:23:42.360]   My mom, Valium and pot and things like that.
[02:23:42.360 --> 02:23:43.840]   But as far as interacting with her,
[02:23:43.840 --> 02:23:45.520]   I'd never done anything like that.
[02:23:45.520 --> 02:23:47.240]   By this point in time,
[02:23:47.240 --> 02:23:48.840]   I'm kind of getting head over heels with her.
[02:23:48.840 --> 02:23:50.320]   I've moved her in with me and everything.
[02:23:50.320 --> 02:23:54.280]   And I had never, I was 34,
[02:23:54.280 --> 02:23:57.760]   I'd never went through a woman's purse in my entire life.
[02:23:57.760 --> 02:24:00.960]   And so she comes in, passes out,
[02:24:00.960 --> 02:24:04.440]   and I'm like, "I gotta know what the fuck's going on."
[02:24:04.440 --> 02:24:09.440]   And went over and went through her purse, found cocaine.
[02:24:09.440 --> 02:24:13.160]   And the straw, cut off straws and all that stuff.
[02:24:13.160 --> 02:24:15.440]   And I'm like, broke my heart.
[02:24:15.440 --> 02:24:17.440]   I just sat there and started crying.
[02:24:17.440 --> 02:24:23.360]   Got online and I'm the guy that can find information.
[02:24:23.360 --> 02:24:26.840]   So I started looking for forums on strip clubs.
[02:24:26.840 --> 02:24:29.760]   Found a forum, found that one,
[02:24:29.760 --> 02:24:32.000]   found where it was talking about her
[02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:35.880]   prostituting herself to support the habit.
[02:24:35.880 --> 02:24:40.520]   And that got me, man.
[02:24:40.520 --> 02:24:41.360]   That got me.
[02:24:41.360 --> 02:24:45.720]   I was talking about everything she was doing to do that.
[02:24:45.720 --> 02:24:46.960]   - And that broke your heart there.
[02:24:46.960 --> 02:24:49.520]   - Oh man, yeah.
[02:24:49.520 --> 02:24:53.680]   So I didn't have the heart to tell her
[02:24:53.680 --> 02:24:55.840]   that I knew she was prostituting.
[02:24:55.840 --> 02:24:57.200]   But I went to her and I was like,
[02:24:57.200 --> 02:24:58.160]   she's waking up and I was like,
[02:24:58.160 --> 02:25:00.240]   "Look, I found this in your purse.
[02:25:00.240 --> 02:25:02.640]   "I can't have that."
[02:25:02.640 --> 02:25:04.440]   And she's like, "Well, you think I'm prostituting?"
[02:25:04.440 --> 02:25:06.280]   I was like, "No, no, I don't think that."
[02:25:06.280 --> 02:25:08.720]   I knew it, but I didn't mention it to her.
[02:25:08.720 --> 02:25:11.760]   And I was like, "I can't have that."
[02:25:11.760 --> 02:25:13.000]   "Well, I don't do that.
[02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:14.000]   "It's just a one-time thing."
[02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:15.520]   I was like, "All right."
[02:25:15.520 --> 02:25:18.040]   So she went back to work
[02:25:18.040 --> 02:25:20.120]   and continued to do it for a couple more weeks.
[02:25:20.120 --> 02:25:23.000]   And then finally I was like, "I can't."
[02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:24.240]   So I picked her up one morning.
[02:25:24.240 --> 02:25:28.720]   It was like, she couldn't drive home.
[02:25:28.720 --> 02:25:30.960]   Before I picked her up, I had written her a note,
[02:25:30.960 --> 02:25:32.840]   left it on the pillow.
[02:25:32.840 --> 02:25:35.480]   So I brought her home, tucked her in the bed,
[02:25:35.480 --> 02:25:40.480]   and told her I'd be back that night.
[02:25:40.480 --> 02:25:43.480]   Told her she had a letter when she woke up.
[02:25:43.480 --> 02:25:45.360]   I woke up and the letter was basically,
[02:25:45.360 --> 02:25:46.760]   "I love you.
[02:25:46.760 --> 02:25:50.600]   "If you can't stop this, don't be here when I get back."
[02:25:50.600 --> 02:25:55.040]   And I went to Columbia that day.
[02:25:55.040 --> 02:26:01.400]   Came back that night and she had quit her job.
[02:26:01.400 --> 02:26:09.280]   And she quit drugs that night.
[02:26:09.280 --> 02:26:12.440]   Really quit 'em.
[02:26:12.440 --> 02:26:16.800]   And I got it in my head.
[02:26:16.800 --> 02:26:21.800]   That I needed to do whatever I needed to do
[02:26:21.800 --> 02:26:26.640]   to make sure she didn't go back to that.
[02:26:26.640 --> 02:26:34.240]   That became, to me, because of my background,
[02:26:34.240 --> 02:26:37.520]   that meant spending a lot of money.
[02:26:37.520 --> 02:26:42.520]   And so every night was $300 to $600 for dinner.
[02:26:42.520 --> 02:26:47.120]   It was $1,000 shoes every week,
[02:26:47.120 --> 02:26:49.520]   $2,000 purse every week, all that.
[02:26:49.520 --> 02:26:53.360]   I had most of my money laundered out to Estonia.
[02:26:53.360 --> 02:26:59.840]   And Elizabeth, at the same time, she quit.
[02:26:59.840 --> 02:27:07.640]   But she didn't want me to go anywhere.
[02:27:07.640 --> 02:27:12.060]   All right, she wanted me there all the time.
[02:27:12.060 --> 02:27:14.280]   I guess that was that connection.
[02:27:14.280 --> 02:27:16.800]   I guess she was scared she might go back to something.
[02:27:16.800 --> 02:27:21.720]   So, Shadow Crew gets busted.
[02:27:21.720 --> 02:27:24.920]   I go through basically all my US funds.
[02:27:24.920 --> 02:27:26.760]   Can't get anything from overseas.
[02:27:26.760 --> 02:27:28.480]   Shadow Crew gets busted October.
[02:27:28.480 --> 02:27:32.880]   I can't go into committing tax fraud because season's over.
[02:27:32.880 --> 02:27:34.240]   Can't go back into credit fraud
[02:27:34.240 --> 02:27:35.780]   because Shadow Crew's been busted.
[02:27:35.780 --> 02:27:38.120]   I don't know who to trust online.
[02:27:38.120 --> 02:27:40.940]   I'm left with running counterfeit cashier's checks
[02:27:40.940 --> 02:27:43.120]   to get money in, trying to make it until
[02:27:43.120 --> 02:27:46.480]   I can start back with some other fraud,
[02:27:46.480 --> 02:27:49.200]   and lying to her the entire time.
[02:27:49.200 --> 02:27:50.840]   - She knows about none of this?
[02:27:50.840 --> 02:27:51.680]   - None of it.
[02:27:51.680 --> 02:27:55.800]   And she thinks I've got a shitload of money.
[02:27:55.800 --> 02:27:58.680]   And she's got expensive taste.
[02:27:58.680 --> 02:28:05.380]   And at the same time, she couldn't be intimate.
[02:28:05.380 --> 02:28:09.160]   I mean, the girl loved me.
[02:28:09.160 --> 02:28:11.320]   That's the first time I've really said that.
[02:28:11.320 --> 02:28:15.480]   - So there's a deep love there, both ways.
[02:28:15.480 --> 02:28:16.320]   - Yeah.
[02:28:16.320 --> 02:28:18.800]   Yeah.
[02:28:18.800 --> 02:28:19.760]   - The things we do.
[02:28:19.760 --> 02:28:26.560]   - So, she couldn't be intimate unless she was stone-cold drunk.
[02:28:26.560 --> 02:28:32.980]   I mean, just shit, stone-cold drunk.
[02:28:32.980 --> 02:28:38.160]   And I, you know, shit, I didn't mind her drinking alcohol.
[02:28:38.160 --> 02:28:40.880]   I'd rather have that than cocaine.
[02:28:40.880 --> 02:28:44.640]   So, that was the intimacy there.
[02:28:44.640 --> 02:28:46.120]   And I kept, I had this,
[02:28:46.120 --> 02:28:50.140]   I kept thinking if I continued to invest,
[02:28:50.140 --> 02:28:52.880]   that it would work out.
[02:28:52.880 --> 02:28:58.360]   You know, that just keep going, she'll be all right.
[02:28:58.360 --> 02:29:00.440]   We'll be all right.
[02:29:00.440 --> 02:29:06.520]   And what happens is, like I said,
[02:29:06.520 --> 02:29:09.600]   she thought I had money, she thought I had money.
[02:29:09.600 --> 02:29:11.800]   She wanted a couple of Tiffany engagement rings.
[02:29:11.800 --> 02:29:13.800]   So I said, we can get married.
[02:29:13.800 --> 02:29:17.040]   You know, I figured marriage, show her that I love her,
[02:29:17.040 --> 02:29:18.440]   show her it's gonna be all right.
[02:29:18.440 --> 02:29:21.320]   So I was like, let's get married.
[02:29:21.320 --> 02:29:23.880]   She's like, well, I've always wanted a Tiffany ring.
[02:29:23.880 --> 02:29:25.480]   Shit, I didn't have money to buy the Tiffany ring
[02:29:25.480 --> 02:29:26.920]   'cause all my money was overseas.
[02:29:26.920 --> 02:29:31.220]   So here I am, I defraud, so it's counterfeit cashiers.
[02:29:31.220 --> 02:29:36.220]   I find a, like a three carat ring on eBay for 20 grand.
[02:29:36.660 --> 02:29:40.540]   And pay for it with a counterfeit cashier's check.
[02:29:40.540 --> 02:29:43.980]   At the same time, because she doesn't want me to leave,
[02:29:43.980 --> 02:29:45.820]   she needs me there.
[02:29:45.820 --> 02:29:47.740]   Typically, if you're doing that type of crime,
[02:29:47.740 --> 02:29:49.420]   you need to be traveling.
[02:29:49.420 --> 02:29:51.580]   You can't do it in one central area
[02:29:51.580 --> 02:29:53.940]   because you're gonna be identified pretty quickly.
[02:29:53.940 --> 02:29:57.140]   I knew that, but I didn't have much choice.
[02:29:57.140 --> 02:30:00.500]   So start running counterfeit cashier's checks
[02:30:00.500 --> 02:30:03.540]   to get the money to live and everything.
[02:30:03.540 --> 02:30:06.820]   Get the engagement ring.
[02:30:06.820 --> 02:30:09.020]   We were scheduled to be married.
[02:30:09.020 --> 02:30:16.480]   Our wedding date was February 26, 2005.
[02:30:16.480 --> 02:30:24.100]   February 8, 2005, I've got a Tiffany wedding band,
[02:30:24.100 --> 02:30:26.380]   couple of them coming in.
[02:30:26.380 --> 02:30:32.020]   And I get arrested in Charleston, South Carolina.
[02:30:32.020 --> 02:30:34.340]   And she didn't know.
[02:30:34.340 --> 02:30:37.180]   I told her, I said, "I've gotta go pick up those rings."
[02:30:37.180 --> 02:30:39.500]   She thought I was just having them sent in.
[02:30:39.500 --> 02:30:40.700]   Said, "I gotta go get those rings."
[02:30:40.700 --> 02:30:43.220]   And I said, "We'll go out to dinner after that."
[02:30:43.220 --> 02:30:46.920]   And I left at like eight o'clock in the morning.
[02:30:46.920 --> 02:30:52.780]   And I was arrested at, I think 1130, something like that.
[02:30:52.780 --> 02:30:56.540]   Of course, I wanted to call her.
[02:30:56.540 --> 02:30:58.660]   And the FBI got me.
[02:30:58.660 --> 02:31:00.560]   It turns out it was controlled delivery.
[02:31:00.560 --> 02:31:03.180]   There were like 30 agents in the parking lot.
[02:31:03.180 --> 02:31:05.660]   FBI got me, Charleston PD got me.
[02:31:05.660 --> 02:31:08.500]   Within 45 minutes, the Secret Service comes in,
[02:31:08.500 --> 02:31:09.820]   takes over that investigation.
[02:31:09.820 --> 02:31:11.420]   They knew exactly who they had.
[02:31:11.420 --> 02:31:15.240]   Along about seven o'clock at night,
[02:31:15.240 --> 02:31:18.620]   they're like, "We wanna search your house."
[02:31:18.620 --> 02:31:20.980]   And I was like, "Look, I'll sign off on the search
[02:31:20.980 --> 02:31:23.780]   "if you let me go with you so I can see her."
[02:31:23.780 --> 02:31:27.260]   And they were like, "Okay."
[02:31:27.260 --> 02:31:28.900]   So I got to see my phone at that point.
[02:31:28.900 --> 02:31:33.300]   I had like 140 calls where she had been trying
[02:31:33.300 --> 02:31:34.520]   to call all that time.
[02:31:34.520 --> 02:31:35.500]   - She has worries.
[02:31:35.500 --> 02:31:36.700]   - Yeah.
[02:31:36.700 --> 02:31:40.480]   And so they loaped me up and held,
[02:31:40.480 --> 02:31:45.480]   I mean, you talk about 10, 12 cars, 40 agents,
[02:31:45.480 --> 02:31:46.580]   everything else.
[02:31:46.580 --> 02:31:47.940]   She's got a dog at that point.
[02:31:47.940 --> 02:31:49.940]   I'm scared they're gonna shoot the dog.
[02:31:49.940 --> 02:31:57.260]   It was dark and they had me walk up
[02:31:57.260 --> 02:31:58.780]   and they're all behind me.
[02:31:58.780 --> 02:32:01.500]   And I knock on the door and tell her the police are there
[02:32:01.500 --> 02:32:03.860]   and she needs to put the dog up.
[02:32:03.860 --> 02:32:08.180]   So she does and they come in and just start ransacking.
[02:32:08.180 --> 02:32:09.660]   Put me in cuffs, set me down,
[02:32:09.660 --> 02:32:11.420]   start berating her with questions.
[02:32:11.420 --> 02:32:13.780]   She had no idea what the hell was going on.
[02:32:13.780 --> 02:32:16.860]   - Were you able to say a word or two to help her understand?
[02:32:16.860 --> 02:32:18.180]   - Yeah, I was trying to tell her.
[02:32:18.180 --> 02:32:21.620]   And at the same time, they take a watch off her wrist,
[02:32:21.620 --> 02:32:22.980]   they let her keep the ring.
[02:32:22.980 --> 02:32:25.820]   They're telling her, "I'm this guy.
[02:32:25.820 --> 02:32:27.380]   "What's my real name?"
[02:32:27.380 --> 02:32:29.540]   Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang across the board.
[02:32:29.540 --> 02:32:31.060]   - So she's probably terrified.
[02:32:31.060 --> 02:32:33.340]   - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:32:33.340 --> 02:32:34.700]   And I tell her, I was like,
[02:32:34.700 --> 02:32:36.240]   "Look, they're gonna arraign me tomorrow.
[02:32:36.240 --> 02:32:38.460]   "Don't come, don't come."
[02:32:38.460 --> 02:32:42.420]   I said, "I'll see what's going on, but don't show up."
[02:32:42.420 --> 02:32:45.220]   Of course, she's there the next morning, her and her dad.
[02:32:45.220 --> 02:32:47.740]   And she's back in the back crying.
[02:32:47.740 --> 02:32:49.540]   They're reading off the charges.
[02:32:49.540 --> 02:32:54.540]   I'm under $300,000 bond, everything else.
[02:32:55.540 --> 02:32:57.960]   And that's it.
[02:32:57.960 --> 02:33:01.060]   They throw me in a cell.
[02:33:01.060 --> 02:33:03.120]   Meanwhile, more charges keep coming in.
[02:33:03.120 --> 02:33:10.300]   It's like 10, 12 charges a day at that point.
[02:33:10.300 --> 02:33:13.220]   And I'm trying to call her to make sure she's all right.
[02:33:13.220 --> 02:33:16.620]   - Does it get through?
[02:33:16.620 --> 02:33:19.020]   - So I spent three months in jail.
[02:33:19.020 --> 02:33:21.580]   And during that three months, she visits twice.
[02:33:21.580 --> 02:33:23.780]   I get like three or four phone calls to her.
[02:33:24.140 --> 02:33:28.060]   Looking back now, I understand why.
[02:33:28.060 --> 02:33:29.780]   Back then it was like, I'm the victim.
[02:33:29.780 --> 02:33:31.180]   Why doesn't she talk to me?
[02:33:31.180 --> 02:33:35.180]   But now I understand why.
[02:33:35.180 --> 02:33:37.260]   Hell, the girl loved me too.
[02:33:37.260 --> 02:33:39.220]   She found out I was this piece of shit.
[02:33:39.220 --> 02:33:43.500]   After a week in county jail,
[02:33:43.500 --> 02:33:45.860]   two agents fly in from New Jersey,
[02:33:45.860 --> 02:33:48.420]   two Secret Service guys, pull me out of cell,
[02:33:48.420 --> 02:33:50.480]   looked at me and they were like,
[02:33:50.480 --> 02:33:51.460]   "We got your laptop?"
[02:33:51.460 --> 02:33:52.460]   And I was like, "Yeah."
[02:33:52.460 --> 02:33:54.780]   And he's like, "Well, have you got anything
[02:33:54.780 --> 02:33:55.620]   "on your laptop?"
[02:33:55.620 --> 02:33:56.460]   I was like, "Yeah."
[02:33:56.460 --> 02:33:57.540]   He's like, "You're gonna be charged for it."
[02:33:57.540 --> 02:33:59.260]   I was like, "I figured."
[02:33:59.260 --> 02:34:01.680]   And then he looks at me, he's like,
[02:34:01.680 --> 02:34:03.260]   "Can you do anything for us?"
[02:34:03.260 --> 02:34:07.120]   And I told him my exact words were,
[02:34:07.120 --> 02:34:08.660]   "Look, you let me get back with Elizabeth,
[02:34:08.660 --> 02:34:11.260]   "I'll do whatever you want me to do."
[02:34:11.260 --> 02:34:12.600]   And he looks at me, he's like,
[02:34:12.600 --> 02:34:14.180]   "We're gonna get you out."
[02:34:14.180 --> 02:34:15.220]   I was like, "All right."
[02:34:15.220 --> 02:34:17.940]   So they let me sit there for three months
[02:34:17.940 --> 02:34:19.420]   to get a taste of it.
[02:34:19.420 --> 02:34:22.540]   And get me out, my sister,
[02:34:22.540 --> 02:34:25.260]   they have the bond reduced to $1,000.
[02:34:25.260 --> 02:34:27.220]   My sister pays the $1,000 bond.
[02:34:27.220 --> 02:34:29.340]   By this point, she's disowned me
[02:34:29.340 --> 02:34:31.820]   because I'm dating the stripper.
[02:34:31.820 --> 02:34:35.980]   And Denise bonds me out.
[02:34:35.980 --> 02:34:40.260]   The person that I call immediately is Elizabeth.
[02:34:40.260 --> 02:34:41.200]   I'm out.
[02:34:41.200 --> 02:34:43.500]   And she's like, "I'll be there."
[02:34:43.500 --> 02:34:44.660]   I was like, "Okay."
[02:34:44.660 --> 02:34:47.600]   So it's like 11 o'clock at night.
[02:34:49.060 --> 02:34:52.480]   I'm in the parking lot of the Charleston County Jail.
[02:34:52.480 --> 02:34:55.900]   Me and a Secret Service agent standing there.
[02:34:55.900 --> 02:34:58.740]   And Elizabeth had a friend that owned a limo company.
[02:34:58.740 --> 02:35:00.780]   So she pulls up in a limo.
[02:35:00.780 --> 02:35:04.580]   Gets out, pops the trunk,
[02:35:04.580 --> 02:35:06.900]   gets these two plastic containers out
[02:35:06.900 --> 02:35:08.400]   that have my clothes in them.
[02:35:08.400 --> 02:35:12.540]   Drops them on the pavement,
[02:35:12.540 --> 02:35:14.500]   comes over, hugs me,
[02:35:14.500 --> 02:35:15.420]   call me later.
[02:35:15.420 --> 02:35:18.440]   Gets in the car, drives off.
[02:35:18.440 --> 02:35:20.700]   I'm sitting there crying like a baby.
[02:35:20.700 --> 02:35:23.220]   Agent looks at me, "Is that your fiance?"
[02:35:23.220 --> 02:35:24.060]   I'm like, "Yeah."
[02:35:24.060 --> 02:35:25.500]   And he's like, "I am so sorry."
[02:35:25.500 --> 02:35:26.580]   And I'm like, "Yeah."
[02:35:26.580 --> 02:35:28.260]   (laughing)
[02:35:28.260 --> 02:35:29.100]   I had--
[02:35:29.100 --> 02:35:31.420]   She sounds fascinating.
[02:35:31.420 --> 02:35:32.380]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:35:32.380 --> 02:35:33.620]   Pull up in a limo.
[02:35:33.620 --> 02:35:35.860]   (laughing)
[02:35:35.860 --> 02:35:40.120]   I had $30 to my name at that point, $30.
[02:35:40.120 --> 02:35:43.860]   The agent had to pay for my hotel room that first night.
[02:35:43.860 --> 02:35:45.820]   So he drops me off after paying for the hotel room,
[02:35:45.820 --> 02:35:47.260]   buy me something to eat.
[02:35:47.260 --> 02:35:50.200]   Soon as he drops me off, I take that $30,
[02:35:50.200 --> 02:35:52.200]   walk a half mile to Walmart,
[02:35:52.200 --> 02:35:53.800]   buy a prepaid debit card
[02:35:53.800 --> 02:35:56.040]   so I can start back in tax fraud.
[02:35:56.040 --> 02:35:57.520]   Soon as I get back to the hotel room,
[02:35:57.520 --> 02:35:59.480]   call Elizabeth, beg her to come see me.
[02:35:59.480 --> 02:36:03.280]   She comes to see me and we talk most of the night
[02:36:03.280 --> 02:36:05.560]   and convince her to give me a chance.
[02:36:05.560 --> 02:36:06.400]   I tell her that I,
[02:36:06.400 --> 02:36:07.900]   hey, everything's gonna be all right.
[02:36:07.900 --> 02:36:08.740]   They're gonna hire me.
[02:36:08.740 --> 02:36:11.060]   I'm gonna be this big consultant.
[02:36:11.060 --> 02:36:12.460]   Lies, lies.
[02:36:12.460 --> 02:36:14.280]   Just so she'd get back with me.
[02:36:14.280 --> 02:36:16.640]   And she's like, "Okay."
[02:36:16.640 --> 02:36:20.540]   And so we moved from Charleston.
[02:36:20.540 --> 02:36:23.720]   The field office is in Columbia, South Carolina.
[02:36:23.720 --> 02:36:27.200]   And I'm breaking the law.
[02:36:27.200 --> 02:36:30.440]   Even before I start working with them, I'm breaking the law.
[02:36:30.440 --> 02:36:33.760]   And so they've got me in the office,
[02:36:33.760 --> 02:36:36.380]   the field office, they got this big war room in there.
[02:36:36.380 --> 02:36:38.900]   I'm on a laptop, outside line,
[02:36:38.900 --> 02:36:43.220]   laptops hooked up to a 50 inch plasma monitor on the wall.
[02:36:43.220 --> 02:36:46.980]   They've got a desktop sitting directly next to me,
[02:36:46.980 --> 02:36:50.180]   outside line, two secret service officers
[02:36:50.180 --> 02:36:51.280]   in the room at all times
[02:36:51.280 --> 02:36:54.000]   with a South Carolina law enforcement officer.
[02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:59.340]   My job is four to six hours a day, surfing the web,
[02:36:59.340 --> 02:37:01.220]   picking up targets, intel,
[02:37:01.220 --> 02:37:02.940]   teaching them how cybercrime operates,
[02:37:02.940 --> 02:37:04.780]   everything else like that.
[02:37:04.780 --> 02:37:09.220]   For the first two weeks, they are extremely diligent.
[02:37:09.220 --> 02:37:10.820]   They pay attention to everything that's going on,
[02:37:10.820 --> 02:37:12.040]   ask questions, everything else.
[02:37:12.040 --> 02:37:17.040]   But the problem is, is that that shit gets boring real quick
[02:37:17.040 --> 02:37:20.460]   'cause I'm very fast online doing that.
[02:37:20.460 --> 02:37:22.620]   So they're like, "What the hell is he doing?"
[02:37:22.620 --> 02:37:25.540]   And it gets tiring looking at a guy just doing that shit.
[02:37:25.540 --> 02:37:28.940]   So after two weeks, they get lazy and bored
[02:37:28.940 --> 02:37:33.940]   and they start watching porn instead of watching me.
[02:37:33.940 --> 02:37:37.260]   At the same time, they've got a key logger
[02:37:37.260 --> 02:37:39.700]   and they've got Spectre Pro and Camtasia,
[02:37:39.700 --> 02:37:41.720]   key loggers and taking snapshots
[02:37:41.720 --> 02:37:43.880]   of everything that I'm doing.
[02:37:43.880 --> 02:37:47.000]   Every night it goes on a DVD-ROM on a spindle.
[02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:50.740]   So I'm like, "They're not gonna go through that shit."
[02:37:50.740 --> 02:37:54.440]   So I'm like, "Fuck it, start breaking it all
[02:37:54.440 --> 02:37:56.440]   "from inside the secret service offices
[02:37:56.440 --> 02:37:58.560]   "while they're in the room, why not?"
[02:37:58.560 --> 02:38:02.660]   That continues for 10 months.
[02:38:02.660 --> 02:38:07.000]   At the same time, the relationship with Elizabeth
[02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:09.340]   fell apart, completely fell apart.
[02:38:10.180 --> 02:38:11.020]   - Wow.
[02:38:11.020 --> 02:38:13.920]   Do you have an understanding of why?
[02:38:13.920 --> 02:38:17.240]   Is it just because her heart got broken
[02:38:17.240 --> 02:38:18.360]   'cause there was lying?
[02:38:18.360 --> 02:38:19.200]   - It was the trust.
[02:38:19.200 --> 02:38:22.160]   - She felt like she did a lot to sacrifice
[02:38:22.160 --> 02:38:23.240]   for the relationship.
[02:38:23.240 --> 02:38:28.240]   - You've got a woman there that,
[02:38:28.240 --> 02:38:33.080]   she had even said it.
[02:38:33.080 --> 02:38:38.080]   She was like, she had told one of her friends
[02:38:38.560 --> 02:38:40.560]   when we were out having dinner one night,
[02:38:40.560 --> 02:38:42.840]   and this was before I got arrested,
[02:38:42.840 --> 02:38:45.360]   she told one of her friends that I was the only guy
[02:38:45.360 --> 02:38:49.000]   that ever asked her to stop using drugs.
[02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:52.180]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:38:52.180 --> 02:38:53.680]   Yeah, I mean, I have to say that,
[02:38:53.680 --> 02:38:57.940]   that part of the story is so powerful.
[02:38:57.940 --> 02:38:58.780]   - And--
[02:38:58.780 --> 02:39:02.840]   - And that she chose to do it and she chose to stop.
[02:39:02.840 --> 02:39:07.480]   - And she told me that, there's one instance
[02:39:07.480 --> 02:39:09.560]   she told me that if she didn't marry me,
[02:39:09.560 --> 02:39:10.960]   she'd never be married.
[02:39:10.960 --> 02:39:15.920]   And as far as I know, she's never been married.
[02:39:15.920 --> 02:39:17.880]   - And so it started to fall apart there.
[02:39:17.880 --> 02:39:22.400]   - Yeah, because I was that piece of shit.
[02:39:22.400 --> 02:39:25.540]   - Still, you didn't take a step.
[02:39:25.540 --> 02:39:29.640]   By the way, can I just say how just moving it is,
[02:39:29.640 --> 02:39:32.160]   how honest you are, but thank you.
[02:39:32.160 --> 02:39:33.800]   Thank you for being that person.
[02:39:34.680 --> 02:39:38.520]   But at that time, there's still that line.
[02:39:38.520 --> 02:39:40.720]   - Oh man, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:39:40.720 --> 02:39:43.480]   So it's falling apart.
[02:39:43.480 --> 02:39:46.800]   She wants to start going to strip clubs
[02:39:46.800 --> 02:39:50.200]   and I'm like, fuck it, why not?
[02:39:50.200 --> 02:39:51.640]   We'll go.
[02:39:51.640 --> 02:39:54.200]   So we started going to strip clubs and she'll come back
[02:39:54.200 --> 02:39:58.080]   and be getting wasted and we'll have sex, what have you.
[02:39:58.080 --> 02:40:03.080]   And one night she looks at me and she was like,
[02:40:03.080 --> 02:40:08.080]   "I think it'd be funny if you got a blowjob
[02:40:08.080 --> 02:40:11.440]   from somebody else."
[02:40:11.440 --> 02:40:16.520]   And that got me, that got me.
[02:40:16.520 --> 02:40:20.720]   I was like, to me, that was the final straw right there.
[02:40:20.720 --> 02:40:23.280]   I was like, she doesn't care for me anymore
[02:40:23.280 --> 02:40:25.480]   or anything else like that.
[02:40:25.480 --> 02:40:27.280]   We'd been going to strip clubs.
[02:40:27.280 --> 02:40:29.120]   So I started dating another stripper
[02:40:29.120 --> 02:40:32.480]   and she knew something was going on.
[02:40:33.480 --> 02:40:37.000]   And she looks at me one day and she's like,
[02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:39.080]   "Why don't you just tell me that it's over?"
[02:40:39.080 --> 02:40:42.160]   And I looked at her and I said, "It's over, we're done."
[02:40:42.160 --> 02:40:45.800]   And I told her, I was like, "Look," I said,
[02:40:45.800 --> 02:40:49.560]   "Whatever you want, we're renting an apartment."
[02:40:49.560 --> 02:40:52.960]   I was like, "Whatever you want in here, take it."
[02:40:52.960 --> 02:40:55.200]   And I said, "Not only that,
[02:40:55.200 --> 02:40:59.640]   but I'll make sure you got money."
[02:41:01.480 --> 02:41:04.120]   "For several months, so you're all right."
[02:41:04.120 --> 02:41:07.280]   And I was like, "Just leave me, leave my TV
[02:41:07.280 --> 02:41:10.360]   and leave me some plates and stuff."
[02:41:10.360 --> 02:41:15.000]   So I go to work that day at the Secret Service,
[02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:19.240]   come back that night and she's taken everything
[02:41:19.240 --> 02:41:22.760]   and left a picture of herself in the bedroom on the floor.
[02:41:22.760 --> 02:41:25.520]   I'm like, "Okay, I guess I deserve that."
[02:41:25.520 --> 02:41:28.760]   - She's got, I like her.
[02:41:28.760 --> 02:41:30.080]   She's got- - Yeah, she was cool.
[02:41:30.080 --> 02:41:31.400]   She was cool.
[02:41:31.400 --> 02:41:36.400]   So I've given her a thousand dollars like every two weeks
[02:41:36.400 --> 02:41:37.680]   for some shit like this.
[02:41:37.680 --> 02:41:40.200]   And it gets to the point,
[02:41:40.200 --> 02:41:43.600]   'cause I'm doing this tax fraud from inside the offices.
[02:41:43.600 --> 02:41:47.920]   Well, the debit card companies are pinging the cards.
[02:41:47.920 --> 02:41:48.760]   They start to realize that,
[02:41:48.760 --> 02:41:50.840]   "Hey, some son of a bitch is stealing money
[02:41:50.840 --> 02:41:51.840]   using our debit card."
[02:41:51.840 --> 02:41:53.280]   So they start to shut down the cards
[02:41:53.280 --> 02:41:55.000]   before I can pull cash out.
[02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:57.360]   So I start not to have the money to send to her.
[02:41:57.360 --> 02:42:01.080]   And I'm like, so she calls and she's like,
[02:42:01.080 --> 02:42:02.960]   "Look, I have to have money."
[02:42:02.960 --> 02:42:05.840]   And I was like, "Well, look, I'm doing what I can.
[02:42:05.840 --> 02:42:06.840]   You promised money."
[02:42:06.840 --> 02:42:09.280]   And I was like, "Look, if you knew what I was doing
[02:42:09.280 --> 02:42:11.680]   to get this money, you wouldn't be asking that."
[02:42:11.680 --> 02:42:13.960]   And she was like, "I need money.
[02:42:13.960 --> 02:42:16.640]   My rent's behind by a month right now."
[02:42:16.640 --> 02:42:18.120]   And I'm like, "Your rent's behind?"
[02:42:18.120 --> 02:42:18.960]   She's like, "Yeah."
[02:42:18.960 --> 02:42:20.400]   So I was like, "Okay."
[02:42:20.400 --> 02:42:23.480]   So I pick up the phone, call the rental office.
[02:42:23.480 --> 02:42:27.040]   And I was like, "Just wanna make sure that,
[02:42:27.040 --> 02:42:28.600]   I'm sorry I'm behind on the rent
[02:42:28.600 --> 02:42:29.800]   for this apartment number."
[02:42:29.800 --> 02:42:32.480]   She's like, "Oh no, that rent's paid up three months."
[02:42:32.480 --> 02:42:35.720]   It's like, "Okay, hang up, call Elizabeth back."
[02:42:35.720 --> 02:42:38.160]   I was like, "You're behind on the rent?"
[02:42:38.160 --> 02:42:39.480]   And she was like, "Yeah."
[02:42:39.480 --> 02:42:41.840]   And I was like, "Funny.
[02:42:41.840 --> 02:42:43.480]   They just said you're up on it three months."
[02:42:43.480 --> 02:42:45.560]   And she gets quiet and she's like,
[02:42:45.560 --> 02:42:47.560]   "Well, you lied to me too."
[02:42:47.560 --> 02:42:50.560]   And I was like, "You're right.
[02:42:50.560 --> 02:42:52.440]   I did, I did that."
[02:42:52.440 --> 02:42:54.760]   I was like, "But look, I can't do it anymore."
[02:42:54.760 --> 02:42:58.840]   And that's the last time I spoke to her, right there.
[02:42:59.840 --> 02:43:01.440]   What happens is,
[02:43:01.440 --> 02:43:06.440]   is I was breaking the law from inside the offices.
[02:43:06.440 --> 02:43:11.040]   I had a buddy that his name was Sean Mims
[02:43:11.040 --> 02:43:12.640]   out of Los Angeles.
[02:43:12.640 --> 02:43:14.880]   I had taught him how to do tax return fraud.
[02:43:14.880 --> 02:43:18.320]   I had told Sean, I go missing, right?
[02:43:18.320 --> 02:43:19.360]   I go missing for three months.
[02:43:19.360 --> 02:43:22.400]   I told him if I ever went missing not to contact me.
[02:43:22.400 --> 02:43:26.840]   And so I go missing, then I show back up online.
[02:43:26.840 --> 02:43:28.480]   First day he contacts.
[02:43:28.480 --> 02:43:29.960]   So he becomes a target.
[02:43:29.960 --> 02:43:33.200]   And they identify him pretty quickly at that point.
[02:43:33.200 --> 02:43:38.200]   He's set to be arrested sometime in March of six.
[02:43:38.200 --> 02:43:40.920]   That's when he's set to be arrested.
[02:43:40.920 --> 02:43:43.160]   Operation Rolling Stone was the name of the operation.
[02:43:43.160 --> 02:43:45.840]   Nine people were supposed to be arrested that night.
[02:43:45.840 --> 02:43:49.960]   So secret service goes and arrests this guy.
[02:43:49.960 --> 02:43:53.720]   They search his apartment and don't find anything.
[02:43:53.720 --> 02:43:56.360]   The apartment manager comes out and explains to him
[02:43:56.360 --> 02:43:58.440]   how Sean has done all kinds of work to the apartment.
[02:43:58.440 --> 02:44:01.760]   As a matter of fact, he brought in $30,000
[02:44:01.760 --> 02:44:04.640]   worth of Italian tile to put in the apartment
[02:44:04.640 --> 02:44:06.000]   that he's renting.
[02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:09.320]   And by the way, last night he had a U-Haul out here
[02:44:09.320 --> 02:44:11.760]   and took out a whole shit load of stuff.
[02:44:11.760 --> 02:44:15.640]   So secret service comes back in.
[02:44:15.640 --> 02:44:16.840]   They look at me and they're like,
[02:44:16.840 --> 02:44:18.560]   we need you to take a polygraph.
[02:44:18.560 --> 02:44:23.280]   And my answer was, I ain't taking a polygraph.
[02:44:23.280 --> 02:44:25.040]   So they're like, well, we'll throw you back in jail
[02:44:25.040 --> 02:44:25.880]   if you don't.
[02:44:25.880 --> 02:44:26.720]   And I was like, call my lawyer.
[02:44:26.720 --> 02:44:27.800]   Lawyer gets me on the phone.
[02:44:27.800 --> 02:44:30.440]   He's like, you don't have to take polygraph.
[02:44:30.440 --> 02:44:31.600]   I was like, well, good, I'm not going to.
[02:44:31.600 --> 02:44:34.040]   He's like, but they will throw you back in jail.
[02:44:34.040 --> 02:44:35.880]   I was like, don't wanna do that.
[02:44:35.880 --> 02:44:39.080]   He's like, have you done anything?
[02:44:39.080 --> 02:44:41.280]   And I was like, yeah.
[02:44:41.280 --> 02:44:45.240]   And he's like, well, you can try to pass the polygraph.
[02:44:45.240 --> 02:44:46.840]   (both laughing)
[02:44:46.840 --> 02:44:48.160]   I'm like, okay.
[02:44:48.160 --> 02:44:51.320]   So I was like, let's take the polygraph.
[02:44:51.320 --> 02:44:52.400]   They asked three questions.
[02:44:52.400 --> 02:44:56.440]   The questions were, have you talked to anybody?
[02:44:56.440 --> 02:44:59.000]   Have you been on a computer outside of the offices?
[02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:00.440]   Have you talked to the press,
[02:45:00.440 --> 02:45:02.560]   which I was interviewing with a New York Times writer
[02:45:02.560 --> 02:45:03.800]   the entire time?
[02:45:03.800 --> 02:45:05.880]   And then have you contacted or warned anybody
[02:45:05.880 --> 02:45:07.160]   about investigations?
[02:45:07.160 --> 02:45:09.640]   And I failed polygraph completely.
[02:45:09.640 --> 02:45:11.120]   So they revoked the bond.
[02:45:11.120 --> 02:45:15.160]   Take me back down to Charleston County, throw me in a jail.
[02:45:15.160 --> 02:45:19.840]   Three days later, Secret Service shows back up
[02:45:19.840 --> 02:45:21.440]   and pulled me out of a cell.
[02:45:21.440 --> 02:45:23.360]   It's Jim Ramacone and Bobby Kirby.
[02:45:23.360 --> 02:45:27.320]   And they were, I mean, honestly, they were good men.
[02:45:27.320 --> 02:45:30.960]   And they gave me chances upon chances to do the right thing.
[02:45:30.960 --> 02:45:33.640]   And I was not ready to do that.
[02:45:33.640 --> 02:45:36.640]   And Jim Ramacone and Bobby's in there.
[02:45:36.640 --> 02:45:39.080]   And Bobby, I mean, Bobby was a friend.
[02:45:39.080 --> 02:45:40.520]   I mean, he truly was.
[02:45:40.520 --> 02:45:43.080]   Later on, a couple of years ago, I had a chance to,
[02:45:43.080 --> 02:45:48.440]   a couple of years ago, I had a chance to,
[02:45:48.440 --> 02:45:51.400]   to have lunch with the man.
[02:45:51.400 --> 02:45:55.120]   And I told him I was sorry for everything I did to him
[02:45:55.120 --> 02:45:58.120]   'cause I got him and another agent fired.
[02:45:58.120 --> 02:46:01.400]   And I told him I was sorry for what happened.
[02:46:01.400 --> 02:46:05.360]   And he told me then, he's like, "We were your friends, man.
[02:46:05.360 --> 02:46:07.480]   "We were truly your friends."
[02:46:07.480 --> 02:46:08.320]   So they were good men.
[02:46:08.320 --> 02:46:09.160]   - They wanted to help.
[02:46:09.160 --> 02:46:10.440]   - Yeah.
[02:46:10.440 --> 02:46:12.520]   - They wanted you to be a good man.
[02:46:12.520 --> 02:46:13.360]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:46:13.360 --> 02:46:17.560]   And what got me so damn bad is I told him, I was like,
[02:46:17.560 --> 02:46:19.520]   "Man, I'm trying to be a better guy."
[02:46:19.520 --> 02:46:22.520]   And he's like, "Brett, you always were a good guy.
[02:46:22.520 --> 02:46:24.040]   "You just didn't know it."
[02:46:24.040 --> 02:46:24.880]   And--
[02:46:24.880 --> 02:46:26.040]   - Fuck, people like that.
[02:46:26.040 --> 02:46:26.880]   - Yeah.
[02:46:26.880 --> 02:46:28.240]   - We need people like that in this world.
[02:46:28.240 --> 02:46:29.080]   - Yeah.
[02:46:29.080 --> 02:46:32.480]   - You need somebody to basically believe--
[02:46:32.480 --> 02:46:33.320]   - Oh, man.
[02:46:33.320 --> 02:46:35.480]   - That you can be a good man.
[02:46:35.480 --> 02:46:37.280]   - So Jim Ramacone pulls me out.
[02:46:37.280 --> 02:46:39.640]   He's the second in charge in South Carolina.
[02:46:39.640 --> 02:46:43.360]   He's got the Miranda waiver in front of him, right?
[02:46:43.360 --> 02:46:45.820]   And he looks at me, he's like, "I'm playing hard ass.
[02:46:45.820 --> 02:46:47.360]   "Bobby's over here looking distraught,
[02:46:47.360 --> 02:46:49.440]   "and you know, like a hurt dog."
[02:46:49.440 --> 02:46:52.880]   And Jim's like, "Here's the way this is gonna work."
[02:46:52.880 --> 02:46:55.280]   He said, "You're gonna tell me everything you've done
[02:46:55.280 --> 02:46:58.080]   "the past six years, or I'm gonna make up my mission
[02:46:58.080 --> 02:47:01.480]   "in life to fuck over you and your family."
[02:47:01.480 --> 02:47:03.480]   And he said, "Not just this case.
[02:47:03.480 --> 02:47:04.960]   "Once you get out of prison,
[02:47:04.960 --> 02:47:07.240]   "I'll hound you the rest of your life."
[02:47:07.240 --> 02:47:09.120]   Then he slides the Miranda waiver over,
[02:47:09.120 --> 02:47:11.600]   and he's like, "Now you wanna talk?"
[02:47:11.600 --> 02:47:14.000]   And I looked at him, I was like, "Nope."
[02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:15.920]   (both laughing)
[02:47:15.920 --> 02:47:19.360]   He was like, he gets up, gets all red in the face,
[02:47:19.360 --> 02:47:23.320]   storms out, on the way out, he's like, "Fuck you very much."
[02:47:23.320 --> 02:47:24.800]   So I go back to the cell.
[02:47:24.800 --> 02:47:28.360]   A week later, I was only under state charges.
[02:47:28.360 --> 02:47:33.000]   A week later, judge rules they revoke the bond improperly.
[02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:34.680]   - Wow.
[02:47:34.680 --> 02:47:37.880]   - Oh, reinstates the bond,
[02:47:37.880 --> 02:47:41.380]   nobody calls the Secret Service to tell him I walk out.
[02:47:41.380 --> 02:47:44.440]   I walk out, I was dating this stripper,
[02:47:44.440 --> 02:47:47.040]   and I told my mom, I was like,
[02:47:47.040 --> 02:47:49.120]   "Well, if they're gonna fuck me,
[02:47:49.120 --> 02:47:50.760]   "they're gonna have to find me."
[02:47:50.760 --> 02:47:52.320]   (both laughing)
[02:47:52.320 --> 02:47:53.640]   - I see she went on the move.
[02:47:53.640 --> 02:47:55.480]   - Yeah, I called this stripper girl up,
[02:47:55.480 --> 02:47:58.640]   I'd given her like 60K, some bullshit like that.
[02:47:58.640 --> 02:48:01.960]   And I told her, I was like, "Kim, I need some money."
[02:48:01.960 --> 02:48:03.440]   And she was like, "What?"
[02:48:03.440 --> 02:48:05.960]   I was like, "Look," I said, "Give me $1,000.
[02:48:05.960 --> 02:48:08.240]   "I'll give you back $3,000 in two weeks."
[02:48:08.240 --> 02:48:09.080]   She was like, "Okay."
[02:48:09.080 --> 02:48:10.920]   So I met her in Augusta, Georgia,
[02:48:10.920 --> 02:48:14.120]   and got the thousand from her
[02:48:14.120 --> 02:48:16.640]   and started driving west on I-20.
[02:48:16.640 --> 02:48:18.560]   No idea where to go to, anything else.
[02:48:18.560 --> 02:48:20.400]   Got to Dallas.
[02:48:20.400 --> 02:48:23.120]   There was a prepaid debit card supplier in Dallas.
[02:48:23.120 --> 02:48:25.320]   Went in, walked in the office,
[02:48:25.320 --> 02:48:27.440]   convinced the guy, social engineering,
[02:48:27.440 --> 02:48:29.640]   convinced the guy to give me 60 prepaid debit cards
[02:48:29.640 --> 02:48:30.680]   without a driver's license,
[02:48:30.680 --> 02:48:33.120]   without payment, anything else he did.
[02:48:33.120 --> 02:48:35.300]   And that started the run.
[02:48:35.300 --> 02:48:39.040]   I ended up stealing, from that, I stole like 160K profit,
[02:48:39.040 --> 02:48:41.040]   used that to buy a Jeep Cherokee,
[02:48:41.040 --> 02:48:43.960]   and the idea was to steal enough money
[02:48:43.960 --> 02:48:47.280]   to bug out to Florianopolis, Brazil,
[02:48:47.280 --> 02:48:49.460]   and set up shop down there,
[02:48:49.460 --> 02:48:51.040]   (laughs)
[02:48:51.040 --> 02:48:51.880]   and do it again.
[02:48:51.880 --> 02:48:52.700]   That was the dream.
[02:48:52.700 --> 02:48:53.680]   That was it, that was it.
[02:48:53.680 --> 02:48:56.160]   So I was on the run for four months,
[02:48:56.160 --> 02:48:58.280]   stole $600,000.
[02:48:58.280 --> 02:48:59.960]   I was in Las Vegas, Nevada.
[02:48:59.960 --> 02:49:01.560]   One day, I had stolen,
[02:49:01.560 --> 02:49:04.340]   the night before I had stolen 160K out of ATMs.
[02:49:04.340 --> 02:49:07.600]   Went in the next morning, I woke up,
[02:49:07.600 --> 02:49:09.520]   signed on to cartersmarket.com,
[02:49:09.520 --> 02:49:11.760]   which was ran by Max Butler, the Iceman,
[02:49:11.760 --> 02:49:16.000]   and there's my name, US Most Wanted on it.
[02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:18.960]   And that gets your attention.
[02:49:18.960 --> 02:49:19.920]   That was my real name,
[02:49:19.920 --> 02:49:21.320]   with the US Most Wanted beside of it.
[02:49:21.320 --> 02:49:24.000]   Nobody knew my real name in that environment at all,
[02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:25.120]   but then they did.
[02:49:25.120 --> 02:49:28.680]   And it was talking about me being part of the Secret Service,
[02:49:28.680 --> 02:49:31.300]   Operation Anglerfish, everything else.
[02:49:31.300 --> 02:49:32.300]   So of course, they're all like--
[02:49:32.300 --> 02:49:33.880]   - So everybody's after you.
[02:49:33.880 --> 02:49:34.720]   - They're like, oh yeah,
[02:49:34.720 --> 02:49:36.720]   we're gonna get this son of a bitch.
[02:49:36.720 --> 02:49:38.160]   So I sit there looking at it,
[02:49:38.160 --> 02:49:39.520]   and I was like, said it out loud,
[02:49:39.520 --> 02:49:40.720]   I was like, well, Mr. Johnson,
[02:49:40.720 --> 02:49:42.920]   you've made the United States Most Wanted list,
[02:49:42.920 --> 02:49:44.120]   what do you do now?
[02:49:44.120 --> 02:49:46.560]   And I was like, I'm going to Disney World.
[02:49:46.560 --> 02:49:47.800]   (laughing)
[02:49:47.800 --> 02:49:48.640]   - Literally.
[02:49:48.640 --> 02:49:50.800]   - Literally, literally, said that out loud.
[02:49:50.800 --> 02:49:53.120]   So loaded up the Jeep,
[02:49:53.120 --> 02:49:56.760]   drove from Las Vegas to Orlando, Florida,
[02:49:56.760 --> 02:49:59.800]   and got the two annual passes,
[02:49:59.800 --> 02:50:03.000]   one to Disney World, the other one to Universal Studios.
[02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:05.160]   Paid for a timeshare,
[02:50:05.160 --> 02:50:07.320]   they were building these new timeshares
[02:50:07.320 --> 02:50:08.960]   right off of Universal Drive,
[02:50:08.960 --> 02:50:10.800]   building these brand new timeshares,
[02:50:10.800 --> 02:50:13.800]   paid for a timeshare, nine months cash.
[02:50:13.800 --> 02:50:15.000]   I was like, we take cash?
[02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:18.040]   Yeah, we take cash, there's $12,900.
[02:50:18.040 --> 02:50:19.240]   Then it wasn't furnished,
[02:50:19.240 --> 02:50:20.800]   so I went down to a furniture store,
[02:50:20.800 --> 02:50:22.920]   bought $30,000 in furniture.
[02:50:22.920 --> 02:50:27.080]   They had seized a DVD collection of mine worth 30 grand,
[02:50:27.080 --> 02:50:28.360]   bought that back,
[02:50:28.360 --> 02:50:32.040]   and proceeded to go to Disney World every day.
[02:50:32.040 --> 02:50:35.320]   And that lasted about six weeks.
[02:50:35.320 --> 02:50:38.200]   They used a trigger fish, is what they use nowadays,
[02:50:38.200 --> 02:50:42.000]   it's called a stingray, to find me.
[02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:44.880]   So one day I was, it was like 10.30 in the morning
[02:50:44.880 --> 02:50:48.400]   on Saturday, September 16th was the day, 2006.
[02:50:48.400 --> 02:50:50.920]   Yeah, 2006, September 16th.
[02:50:50.920 --> 02:50:54.040]   I was used to the builders coming around, knocking,
[02:50:54.040 --> 02:50:55.920]   making sure everything was all right.
[02:50:55.920 --> 02:50:59.200]   So I was asleep, heard this knock at the door,
[02:50:59.200 --> 02:51:02.200]   and get up, look through the keyhole, nobody's there,
[02:51:02.200 --> 02:51:03.600]   you know, people, nobody's there.
[02:51:03.600 --> 02:51:04.680]   I was like, huh.
[02:51:04.680 --> 02:51:06.960]   Open the door, step out into the hallway,
[02:51:06.960 --> 02:51:09.760]   walking down the hall is Bobby Kirby,
[02:51:09.760 --> 02:51:13.520]   another South Carolina guy and a Orlando,
[02:51:13.520 --> 02:51:14.640]   Orange County cop.
[02:51:14.640 --> 02:51:17.720]   And they turn around, and they're like, "Hey, Brett."
[02:51:17.720 --> 02:51:19.400]   I'm like, "Hey, Bobby, how are you?"
[02:51:19.400 --> 02:51:20.960]   And it's like, "We're good, how are you?"
[02:51:20.960 --> 02:51:23.360]   And I'm like, "I'm fine, would you like to come in?"
[02:51:23.360 --> 02:51:25.520]   He was like, "Let's put you in cuffs first."
[02:51:25.520 --> 02:51:28.040]   And I was like, "That's probably a good idea."
[02:51:28.040 --> 02:51:30.720]   (laughing)
[02:51:30.720 --> 02:51:31.560]   He walks in, he's like--
[02:51:31.560 --> 02:51:32.720]   I like those guys.
[02:51:32.720 --> 02:51:34.600]   He's like, "Have you got anything in here?"
[02:51:34.600 --> 02:51:37.400]   And I was like, "Yeah, there's $120,000 in the bedroom."
[02:51:37.400 --> 02:51:39.040]   And he was like, "Seriously?"
[02:51:39.040 --> 02:51:41.240]   I was like, "Yeah, that and an AK-47."
[02:51:41.240 --> 02:51:42.280]   (laughing)
[02:51:42.280 --> 02:51:44.680]   His face goes white, and he's like, "You got a rifle?"
[02:51:44.680 --> 02:51:46.720]   And I was like, "No, I'm kidding with ya."
[02:51:46.720 --> 02:51:47.560]   (laughing)
[02:51:47.560 --> 02:51:50.760]   He was like, "Okay."
[02:51:50.760 --> 02:51:54.040]   So they throw me in jail in Orange County,
[02:51:54.040 --> 02:51:57.280]   and they give me diesel therapy.
[02:51:57.280 --> 02:52:01.560]   And diesel therapy is, it took like two weeks
[02:52:01.560 --> 02:52:04.760]   to transport me from Orange County, Orlando,
[02:52:04.760 --> 02:52:06.480]   to Columbia, South Carolina.
[02:52:06.480 --> 02:52:08.760]   And what happens is, is you stop at every county jail
[02:52:08.760 --> 02:52:11.400]   you possibly can, go through the processing,
[02:52:11.400 --> 02:52:13.160]   which is about six hours.
[02:52:13.160 --> 02:52:16.600]   Once you get to your bunk, hey, time to transport ya.
[02:52:16.600 --> 02:52:18.040]   (laughing)
[02:52:18.040 --> 02:52:19.840]   They do that on purpose?
[02:52:19.840 --> 02:52:21.640]   On purpose, on purpose.
[02:52:21.640 --> 02:52:24.720]   Wears you down mentally and physically and everything.
[02:52:24.720 --> 02:52:26.920]   I get to Columbia, South Carolina.
[02:52:26.920 --> 02:52:29.000]   Now while I was at Orange County,
[02:52:29.000 --> 02:52:31.040]   what happens is this inmate,
[02:52:31.040 --> 02:52:32.720]   because we were in federal holding,
[02:52:32.720 --> 02:52:35.240]   this inmate, he looks at me, his name was Yeti,
[02:52:35.240 --> 02:52:37.600]   and he's like, "Hey man, you know the only time
[02:52:37.600 --> 02:52:40.560]   "you get off in federal prison is the drug program."
[02:52:40.560 --> 02:52:42.400]   I was like, "Well man, I don't use drugs."
[02:52:42.400 --> 02:52:45.680]   And he's like, "You can find a drug problem, can't ya?"
[02:52:45.680 --> 02:52:48.760]   And I was like, "I can find a drug problem."
[02:52:48.760 --> 02:52:51.600]   So what happens is, is every county jail I stop at
[02:52:51.600 --> 02:52:56.600]   on the way to Columbia, I tell 'em I'm alcoholic and cocaine.
[02:52:56.600 --> 02:52:58.880]   So by the time I get to Columbia, South Carolina,
[02:52:58.880 --> 02:53:00.760]   they've got this paper trail of Mr. Johnson
[02:53:00.760 --> 02:53:02.280]   requesting help for drugs.
[02:53:04.880 --> 02:53:09.880]   I had hired Strom Thurman's son as an attorney.
[02:53:09.880 --> 02:53:12.200]   They make me drop him because I paid for him
[02:53:12.200 --> 02:53:13.520]   with illegal funds.
[02:53:13.520 --> 02:53:15.960]   So they give me a public defender.
[02:53:15.960 --> 02:53:18.520]   He gets a psychological evaluation ordered for me.
[02:53:18.520 --> 02:53:21.680]   So psychologist comes into county jail,
[02:53:21.680 --> 02:53:23.680]   four hour interview, about halfway through,
[02:53:23.680 --> 02:53:25.760]   he looks at me, he's like, "You use any type of drugs?"
[02:53:25.760 --> 02:53:26.600]   I was like, "Yeah."
[02:53:26.600 --> 02:53:27.640]   He's like, "What do you use?"
[02:53:27.640 --> 02:53:28.480]   "Cocaine."
[02:53:28.480 --> 02:53:29.320]   "Smoke or snort?"
[02:53:29.320 --> 02:53:30.160]   "Snort."
[02:53:30.160 --> 02:53:30.980]   "How much?"
[02:53:30.980 --> 02:53:32.520]   "An eight ball a day."
[02:53:32.520 --> 02:53:33.360]   "That's a lot."
[02:53:33.360 --> 02:53:34.200]   "Yeah."
[02:53:34.200 --> 02:53:36.200]   "Do you have any trouble out of that?"
[02:53:36.200 --> 02:53:40.080]   "Yeah, I can't get an erection."
[02:53:40.080 --> 02:53:43.520]   And he looks at me and I'm looking at him like,
[02:53:43.520 --> 02:53:46.440]   'cause I had gotten that shit from Boogie Nights.
[02:53:46.440 --> 02:53:51.800]   Finally I'm like, "Is that right?"
[02:53:51.800 --> 02:53:54.320]   And he was like, "It could happen."
[02:53:54.320 --> 02:53:55.520]   I was like, "Okay."
[02:53:55.520 --> 02:54:00.520]   So that makes it into my pre-sentence report.
[02:54:00.520 --> 02:54:03.640]   So all federal inmates, probation office
[02:54:03.640 --> 02:54:07.040]   and prosecutor, they do this detailed background check
[02:54:07.040 --> 02:54:09.840]   to basically tell the judge how much time to give you.
[02:54:09.840 --> 02:54:14.600]   So that drug bit with that interview makes it into the PSR.
[02:54:14.600 --> 02:54:17.840]   So day of interview, I mean day of sentencing,
[02:54:17.840 --> 02:54:19.840]   I'd pled guilty, day of sentencing,
[02:54:19.840 --> 02:54:23.600]   the prosecutor, he stands up
[02:54:23.600 --> 02:54:26.680]   and this dude is screaming at this point.
[02:54:26.680 --> 02:54:28.840]   And he's like, "Mr. Johnson's manipulated
[02:54:28.840 --> 02:54:31.600]   the Secret Service, he's manipulated the prosecutor."
[02:54:31.600 --> 02:54:33.040]   Then he points at the judge.
[02:54:33.040 --> 02:54:35.640]   "And he's manipulating you today, your honor.
[02:54:35.640 --> 02:54:38.440]   We insist on the upper limits of the guidelines."
[02:54:38.440 --> 02:54:40.520]   Well, I had been telling everybody in the jail
[02:54:40.520 --> 02:54:43.320]   that if they give me any more than 60 months,
[02:54:43.320 --> 02:54:45.040]   I am not staying.
[02:54:45.040 --> 02:54:47.960]   So we're like, "Okay, sure."
[02:54:47.960 --> 02:54:51.800]   So the judge looks at me and she's like, "I agree."
[02:54:51.800 --> 02:54:55.080]   I'm like, and she says, "75 months."
[02:54:55.080 --> 02:54:57.520]   So I looked at my lawyer and I was like,
[02:54:57.520 --> 02:54:59.440]   "Can you get the drug program for me?"
[02:54:59.440 --> 02:55:00.760]   He's like, "I don't know how I ask."
[02:55:00.760 --> 02:55:03.800]   So he stands up, "Your honor, will you order
[02:55:03.800 --> 02:55:05.480]   the drug program for Mr. Johnson?"
[02:55:05.480 --> 02:55:09.320]   The judge says, "No, but I'll recommend he gets evaluated."
[02:55:09.320 --> 02:55:12.920]   So the Secret Service had told her, "Hey, he's full of shit."
[02:55:12.920 --> 02:55:15.000]   So she's like, "No, but I'll recommend he gets evaluated."
[02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:16.920]   I looked at my lawyer and I was like, "What does that mean?"
[02:55:16.920 --> 02:55:18.640]   He was like, "You're probably not gonna get it."
[02:55:18.640 --> 02:55:22.160]   And I was like, "How soon can you get me to the camp?"
[02:55:22.160 --> 02:55:24.720]   And he was like, "Well, if you don't appeal,
[02:55:24.720 --> 02:55:26.200]   I can get you there pretty quick."
[02:55:26.200 --> 02:55:30.320]   My exact words were, "Fuck the appeal, get me to the camp,
[02:55:30.320 --> 02:55:31.760]   I'll take it from there."
[02:55:31.760 --> 02:55:35.360]   He looks at me like I'm the biggest idiot in the world.
[02:55:35.360 --> 02:55:38.400]   I get sent to, 'cause you can get a camp recommended.
[02:55:38.400 --> 02:55:42.080]   I have friends, family members look for camps
[02:55:42.080 --> 02:55:43.760]   that don't have a fence around them.
[02:55:43.760 --> 02:55:45.820]   And we settle on Ashland, Kentucky.
[02:55:45.820 --> 02:55:49.120]   Six weeks later, I'm in Ashland, Kentucky.
[02:55:49.120 --> 02:55:53.960]   And pull up there, 14 foot fence, razor wire on top.
[02:55:53.960 --> 02:55:56.480]   And I'm like, "I don't climb fences."
[02:55:56.480 --> 02:55:57.320]   (laughs)
[02:55:57.320 --> 02:55:58.760]   So I go in.
[02:55:58.760 --> 02:56:00.160]   First question I ask is,
[02:56:00.160 --> 02:56:02.200]   "Are there any jobs outside of the fence?"
[02:56:02.200 --> 02:56:03.740]   And he was like, guards like,
[02:56:03.740 --> 02:56:05.600]   "Well, you can work in the National Forest."
[02:56:05.600 --> 02:56:07.240]   And I'm like, "No, I'll die out there."
[02:56:07.240 --> 02:56:08.080]   (laughs)
[02:56:08.080 --> 02:56:09.720]   He was like, "Well, you could do landscaping."
[02:56:09.720 --> 02:56:12.000]   I'm like, "I can run a weed eater."
[02:56:12.000 --> 02:56:13.360]   (laughs)
[02:56:13.360 --> 02:56:16.920]   Two days later, I walk into the landscaping office
[02:56:16.920 --> 02:56:19.280]   and the cop, this is this genius
[02:56:19.280 --> 02:56:21.200]   of some of these people and institutions.
[02:56:21.200 --> 02:56:25.440]   The cop behind his desk, the entire wall
[02:56:25.440 --> 02:56:29.720]   is a blown up photo of the compound and the outlying area.
[02:56:29.720 --> 02:56:34.120]   So I can literally sit there and plot where I'm going.
[02:56:34.120 --> 02:56:35.000]   All right?
[02:56:35.000 --> 02:56:40.000]   My dad, I hadn't spoken to that man in years.
[02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:43.160]   And he shows up at my sentencing
[02:56:43.160 --> 02:56:45.760]   and stands up in front of the judge.
[02:56:45.760 --> 02:56:47.120]   And he's like, "Your Honor,
[02:56:47.120 --> 02:56:49.720]   I wanna make sure Brett gets a good start.
[02:56:49.720 --> 02:56:52.720]   He can lip with me when he gets out, everything else."
[02:56:52.720 --> 02:56:54.800]   Looking back, the man meant that.
[02:56:54.800 --> 02:56:58.120]   And I just thought it was bullshit at the time.
[02:56:58.120 --> 02:57:00.600]   So he starts to visit me in prison.
[02:57:00.600 --> 02:57:02.320]   I mean, yeah, in prison, he starts to visit.
[02:57:02.320 --> 02:57:06.140]   And about the third visit in, he looks at me, he's like,
[02:57:06.140 --> 02:57:07.720]   "I've been reading about you online."
[02:57:07.720 --> 02:57:08.560]   I was like, "Yeah."
[02:57:08.560 --> 02:57:09.840]   He's like, "Yeah."
[02:57:09.840 --> 02:57:11.240]   He's like, "That's a lot of money you made."
[02:57:11.240 --> 02:57:12.560]   I was like, "Yeah."
[02:57:12.560 --> 02:57:16.160]   He's like, "You think you can teach somebody how to do that?"
[02:57:16.160 --> 02:57:18.560]   (laughs)
[02:57:18.560 --> 02:57:21.680]   And I'm like, so what I used to say,
[02:57:21.680 --> 02:57:24.480]   and again, it's this thing of,
[02:57:24.480 --> 02:57:26.160]   really coming to terms with things.
[02:57:26.160 --> 02:57:27.780]   What I used to say was,
[02:57:27.780 --> 02:57:31.880]   is I thought my dad was back in my life
[02:57:31.880 --> 02:57:34.080]   and that he was just trying to use me.
[02:57:34.080 --> 02:57:35.080]   All right?
[02:57:35.080 --> 02:57:36.720]   The truth of the matter was,
[02:57:36.720 --> 02:57:39.080]   is that my dad hadn't really seen me
[02:57:39.080 --> 02:57:43.320]   except in that frame of crime,
[02:57:43.320 --> 02:57:46.560]   being that criminal with my mom, everything else.
[02:57:46.560 --> 02:57:47.840]   I really think that's how the man
[02:57:47.840 --> 02:57:49.920]   was trying to communicate with me.
[02:57:49.920 --> 02:57:52.040]   - He wanted to connect with you in the places
[02:57:52.040 --> 02:57:53.280]   where you know, where you love,
[02:57:53.280 --> 02:57:54.840]   where you're interested in,
[02:57:54.840 --> 02:57:56.400]   where your addiction is, essentially.
[02:57:56.400 --> 02:58:00.000]   - And what I did is I manipulated the man
[02:58:00.000 --> 02:58:01.920]   into helping me escape.
[02:58:01.920 --> 02:58:04.240]   So I agreed to teach him how to do tax fraud.
[02:58:04.240 --> 02:58:06.840]   And in return, he had, the only money he had to his name,
[02:58:06.840 --> 02:58:09.080]   he had $4,000 cash.
[02:58:09.080 --> 02:58:11.240]   So I manipulated him into giving me that
[02:58:11.240 --> 02:58:13.280]   and to dropping me off a change of clothes,
[02:58:13.280 --> 02:58:14.840]   a cell phone, and a driver's license.
[02:58:14.840 --> 02:58:15.960]   The only driver's license he had
[02:58:15.960 --> 02:58:18.320]   was my driver's license, Brett Johnson.
[02:58:18.320 --> 02:58:22.720]   So I was at the camp for, I don't know, six, eight weeks.
[02:58:22.720 --> 02:58:25.660]   And the hardest worker that landscaping had ever seen.
[02:58:25.660 --> 02:58:26.840]   (both laughing)
[02:58:26.840 --> 02:58:29.720]   At one point, the cops got me on a mountainside
[02:58:29.720 --> 02:58:31.680]   with a broom, sweeping off a mountain.
[02:58:31.680 --> 02:58:34.160]   I'm like, "Yeah, we'll do that, absolutely."
[02:58:34.160 --> 02:58:36.280]   - So you're building trust with the guys there.
[02:58:36.280 --> 02:58:37.480]   - Yeah, working my ass off.
[02:58:37.480 --> 02:58:39.640]   And then six weeks, I take off.
[02:58:39.640 --> 02:58:42.640]   And I lasted, I think, two, three weeks,
[02:58:42.640 --> 02:58:43.720]   something like that.
[02:58:43.720 --> 02:58:45.040]   US Marshals, I made it 120--
[02:58:45.040 --> 02:58:45.960]   - Took off, you escaped.
[02:58:45.960 --> 02:58:47.600]   - Yeah, escaped, escaped.
[02:58:47.600 --> 02:58:50.160]   US Marshals, they're canvassing a three-state area.
[02:58:50.160 --> 02:58:51.920]   They find me, I think, 250 miles away.
[02:58:51.920 --> 02:58:53.800]   It's like Lexington, Kentucky.
[02:58:53.800 --> 02:58:55.120]   They find me in Lexington
[02:58:55.120 --> 02:58:57.320]   because I had to use my real driver's license.
[02:58:57.320 --> 02:59:00.920]   I had a laptop, I had prepaid debit cards,
[02:59:00.920 --> 02:59:03.000]   and I had stolen identity information.
[02:59:03.000 --> 02:59:07.520]   And the way it got me was I had dyed my hair
[02:59:07.520 --> 02:59:10.320]   this flaming red, I had this deep tan,
[02:59:10.320 --> 02:59:12.040]   I didn't look anything like myself.
[02:59:12.040 --> 02:59:16.760]   And I was at a hotel, had the curtains open,
[02:59:16.760 --> 02:59:19.640]   saw this guy, I was on the laptop,
[02:59:19.640 --> 02:59:21.120]   saw this guy walk by.
[02:59:21.120 --> 02:59:24.680]   He walks by the window and he stops.
[02:59:24.680 --> 02:59:28.120]   And then he backs up, he looks inside,
[02:59:28.120 --> 02:59:30.120]   he knocks on the window.
[02:59:30.120 --> 02:59:32.720]   I look up at him, he's like, "You."
[02:59:32.720 --> 02:59:33.560]   I was like, "Me?"
[02:59:33.560 --> 02:59:34.840]   He's like, "You."
[02:59:34.840 --> 02:59:37.480]   Then he pulls out this badge and he points at it.
[02:59:37.480 --> 02:59:41.280]   He's like, and then he points at the door, "Now."
[02:59:41.280 --> 02:59:42.480]   So I was like, "Oh, okay."
[02:59:42.480 --> 02:59:44.560]   So I open up the door and he's like,
[02:59:44.560 --> 02:59:46.320]   "US Marshals Service."
[02:59:46.320 --> 02:59:49.240]   So they arrest me and--
[02:59:49.240 --> 02:59:50.560]   - How did they track you down?
[02:59:50.560 --> 02:59:51.520]   - They canvassed that area.
[02:59:51.520 --> 02:59:53.720]   They talked to every hotel, everything else.
[02:59:53.720 --> 02:59:54.560]   I had--
[02:59:54.560 --> 02:59:56.720]   - So it's like a traditional, like they were just tracking--
[02:59:56.720 --> 02:59:58.400]   - Traditional police work is what it was.
[02:59:58.400 --> 02:59:59.960]   - So it wasn't like from the internet
[02:59:59.960 --> 03:00:00.800]   they kind of got something--
[03:00:00.800 --> 03:00:02.640]   - No, no, just straight police work.
[03:00:02.640 --> 03:00:03.480]   - Good, good, good police work.
[03:00:03.480 --> 03:00:05.760]   - US Marshals are outstanding in everything they do.
[03:00:05.760 --> 03:00:06.720]   So they arrest me.
[03:00:06.720 --> 03:00:09.640]   I go to a, I'm initially held at a county jail
[03:00:09.640 --> 03:00:11.280]   in Moorhead, Kentucky.
[03:00:11.280 --> 03:00:14.640]   And that, man, that was one hell of an experience there.
[03:00:14.640 --> 03:00:17.360]   But then I'm transferred after sentencing on that.
[03:00:17.360 --> 03:00:19.320]   So sentencing, here's the weird thing.
[03:00:20.360 --> 03:00:22.440]   So I spent like, I think, two or three months
[03:00:22.440 --> 03:00:26.200]   at the county jail in Moorhead, Kentucky.
[03:00:26.200 --> 03:00:27.520]   Get sentenced.
[03:00:27.520 --> 03:00:31.560]   At my sentencing, it happens so quickly
[03:00:31.560 --> 03:00:33.520]   after the initial sentencing
[03:00:33.520 --> 03:00:36.360]   that they use the exact same pre-sentence report.
[03:00:36.360 --> 03:00:39.120]   The report that's got all that drug shit in there.
[03:00:39.120 --> 03:00:42.080]   So at my sentencing, prosecutors there,
[03:00:42.080 --> 03:00:47.080]   Secret Service is there, judge me, my attorney.
[03:00:47.080 --> 03:00:48.800]   Prosecutor stands up, he's like,
[03:00:48.800 --> 03:00:51.680]   "Your Honor, we would like it if you would consider
[03:00:51.680 --> 03:00:54.000]   "that when Mr. Johnson was arrested,
[03:00:54.000 --> 03:00:56.480]   "he had a laptop, he had all this information with him,
[03:00:56.480 --> 03:01:00.040]   "looks like he was engaged in identity theft yet again."
[03:01:00.040 --> 03:01:03.480]   Judge looks at the prosecutor, says, "No."
[03:01:03.480 --> 03:01:05.200]   Says, "Hey, if you were gonna charge him with it,
[03:01:05.200 --> 03:01:06.320]   "you should've charged him with it.
[03:01:06.320 --> 03:01:08.520]   "I'm only considering the escape."
[03:01:08.520 --> 03:01:11.600]   Then he looks at me, and he's like, "Mr. Johnson."
[03:01:11.600 --> 03:01:13.880]   He said, "It looks like by you keeping your mouth shut
[03:01:13.880 --> 03:01:16.600]   "right now, you're really saving yourself
[03:01:16.600 --> 03:01:17.760]   "a pretty serious charge."
[03:01:17.760 --> 03:01:20.440]   And my response was, "Yes, Your Honor."
[03:01:20.440 --> 03:01:22.720]   And he was like, then he opens up the pre-sentence report,
[03:01:22.720 --> 03:01:24.040]   he's fingering through, and he's like,
[03:01:24.040 --> 03:01:26.840]   "It also looks like before you got involved
[03:01:26.840 --> 03:01:30.040]   "with all these drugs, you were a pretty good citizen."
[03:01:30.040 --> 03:01:33.240]   I was like, "Yes, Your Honor."
[03:01:33.240 --> 03:01:34.800]   And he's like, "So here's what I'm gonna do."
[03:01:34.800 --> 03:01:38.760]   He said, "I'm gonna give you 18 months on the escape."
[03:01:38.760 --> 03:01:40.200]   I was like, "Okay."
[03:01:40.200 --> 03:01:41.280]   He said, "I'm also gonna give you,"
[03:01:41.280 --> 03:01:42.360]   no, it was 15 months on the escape.
[03:01:42.360 --> 03:01:44.080]   He said, "I'm gonna give you 15 months on the escape."
[03:01:44.080 --> 03:01:46.000]   He said, "And I'm also gonna order
[03:01:46.000 --> 03:01:47.680]   "the drug program for you."
[03:01:47.680 --> 03:01:51.720]   I was like, "Yes, Your Honor."
[03:01:51.720 --> 03:01:54.920]   So the drug program gives you a year off,
[03:01:54.920 --> 03:01:59.240]   and it gives you six months and halfway house.
[03:01:59.240 --> 03:02:03.640]   So by escaping, I got out of prison three months earlier
[03:02:03.640 --> 03:02:05.520]   than what I should have gotten out of.
[03:02:05.520 --> 03:02:09.840]   - So the original thing about drugs worked in the long-
[03:02:09.840 --> 03:02:10.680]   - It worked.
[03:02:10.680 --> 03:02:11.520]   - In the long term.
[03:02:11.520 --> 03:02:12.340]   - Now, the interesting thing with that,
[03:02:12.340 --> 03:02:13.840]   and this was the best lie I ever told,
[03:02:13.840 --> 03:02:15.600]   honestly, the best lie I ever told.
[03:02:15.600 --> 03:02:20.400]   I spent eight months in solitary confinement, okay?
[03:02:20.400 --> 03:02:21.800]   Eight months.
[03:02:21.800 --> 03:02:23.100]   And that's an experience.
[03:02:23.100 --> 03:02:27.480]   'Cause you ain't got no books for the first month or so,
[03:02:27.480 --> 03:02:29.380]   then they give you a King James Bible.
[03:02:29.380 --> 03:02:31.720]   Yeah.
[03:02:31.720 --> 03:02:33.000]   And then-
[03:02:33.000 --> 03:02:35.000]   - For a month, no books.
[03:02:35.000 --> 03:02:36.400]   - No books for a month.
[03:02:36.400 --> 03:02:38.320]   - This is a pretty small-
[03:02:38.320 --> 03:02:39.240]   - Six by nine room.
[03:02:39.240 --> 03:02:40.160]   - Six by nine.
[03:02:40.160 --> 03:02:41.240]   - Yeah.
[03:02:41.240 --> 03:02:42.080]   - No books.
[03:02:42.080 --> 03:02:44.440]   - No books, no paper, no pen, no pencil.
[03:02:44.440 --> 03:02:45.600]   - You're alone with your mind.
[03:02:45.600 --> 03:02:47.240]   - You got a mat, a toilet.
[03:02:47.240 --> 03:02:50.040]   - What's that like?
[03:02:50.040 --> 03:02:52.240]   - You sleep as much as you can.
[03:02:52.240 --> 03:02:55.600]   You're sleeping 16, 18 hours a day is what you're doing.
[03:02:55.600 --> 03:02:57.640]   - What about, were you thinking about
[03:02:57.640 --> 03:03:01.680]   even just going back to like Elizabeth?
[03:03:01.680 --> 03:03:02.560]   Are you thinking about-
[03:03:02.560 --> 03:03:03.720]   - You go through all that.
[03:03:03.720 --> 03:03:04.560]   - The whole thing.
[03:03:04.560 --> 03:03:05.640]   - You go through all that, every bit.
[03:03:05.640 --> 03:03:06.740]   - Your mom too?
[03:03:06.740 --> 03:03:08.880]   - Yeah, going through every single bit of that.
[03:03:08.880 --> 03:03:12.960]   And so you're supposed to get out an hour a day.
[03:03:12.960 --> 03:03:15.320]   Law says you're supposed to get out an hour a day.
[03:03:15.320 --> 03:03:16.360]   That's the law.
[03:03:16.360 --> 03:03:18.220]   That's not the way things actually happen.
[03:03:18.220 --> 03:03:19.120]   What actually happens is,
[03:03:19.120 --> 03:03:21.580]   is you're lucky to get out an hour a week.
[03:03:21.580 --> 03:03:25.400]   You take a shower twice a week and that's it.
[03:03:25.400 --> 03:03:26.880]   You get a phone call once a month.
[03:03:26.880 --> 03:03:28.800]   - Oh, so you don't get to see nature.
[03:03:28.800 --> 03:03:29.760]   - Don't see anything.
[03:03:29.760 --> 03:03:31.320]   You're getting solitary.
[03:03:31.320 --> 03:03:34.240]   All right, and it takes about a week.
[03:03:34.240 --> 03:03:36.520]   The first week is the roughest.
[03:03:36.520 --> 03:03:38.480]   You're bouncing off the walls that first week
[03:03:38.480 --> 03:03:40.720]   'cause you can't sleep, can't do anything else.
[03:03:40.720 --> 03:03:43.680]   Then you start to adapt to it after a while.
[03:03:43.680 --> 03:03:46.600]   When that book does arrive, you're happy as hell to have it.
[03:03:46.600 --> 03:03:49.920]   I've well-versed in the King James Bible.
[03:03:49.920 --> 03:03:51.920]   So you're happy to have it.
[03:03:51.920 --> 03:03:53.840]   Then finally you get other books
[03:03:53.840 --> 03:03:55.520]   that come in from that point.
[03:03:55.520 --> 03:03:57.880]   Spent eight months at that.
[03:03:57.880 --> 03:04:00.560]   And they send me out to a real prison,
[03:04:00.560 --> 03:04:04.940]   Big Spring, Texas, West Texas, where...
[03:04:04.940 --> 03:04:07.280]   Have you been out there?
[03:04:07.280 --> 03:04:08.120]   - No.
[03:04:08.120 --> 03:04:10.000]   But I can tell.
[03:04:10.000 --> 03:04:13.120]   - Prairie dogs and tarantulas is what it is.
[03:04:13.120 --> 03:04:17.680]   No kidding, it gets so hot that warnings come on the radio
[03:04:17.680 --> 03:04:19.680]   telling you not to drive on certain streets
[03:04:19.680 --> 03:04:21.160]   because they're melted.
[03:04:21.160 --> 03:04:22.500]   That's Big Spring.
[03:04:22.500 --> 03:04:27.280]   So if you've seen the movie "From Dusk Till Dawn,"
[03:04:27.280 --> 03:04:29.580]   the opening scene is in Big Spring, Texas.
[03:04:29.580 --> 03:04:31.760]   - So it's hot.
[03:04:31.760 --> 03:04:32.600]   - Yeah, very hot.
[03:04:32.600 --> 03:04:35.400]   So, and that's where I find out what a real prison is.
[03:04:35.400 --> 03:04:38.520]   And it's not ran by guards.
[03:04:38.520 --> 03:04:41.720]   Prisons are ran by inmates, and that's a fact.
[03:04:41.720 --> 03:04:46.720]   So you're met at the door by whatever race you are,
[03:04:46.720 --> 03:04:48.320]   is what happens.
[03:04:48.320 --> 03:04:50.840]   So Big Spring is a converted Air Force compound.
[03:04:50.840 --> 03:04:52.160]   It's a disciplinary prison,
[03:04:52.160 --> 03:04:54.200]   so you get the bad guys that are in there.
[03:04:54.200 --> 03:04:55.360]   So I get...
[03:04:55.360 --> 03:05:00.200]   I go through processing, and I'm walking up to the unit,
[03:05:00.200 --> 03:05:03.600]   and I'm met at the door by a guy named Nick Sandifer.
[03:05:03.600 --> 03:05:06.240]   He's the treasurer of the Aryan Brotherhood.
[03:05:06.240 --> 03:05:09.160]   And first question out of his mouth is,
[03:05:09.160 --> 03:05:10.720]   "Any more white guys come in?"
[03:05:10.720 --> 03:05:11.720]   And shit, I didn't know.
[03:05:11.720 --> 03:05:13.800]   I was like, "I don't know, four or five?"
[03:05:13.800 --> 03:05:17.440]   Next question is, "What are you in here for?"
[03:05:17.440 --> 03:05:19.360]   My answer was, 'cause I'm like, "I ain't got no worries."
[03:05:19.360 --> 03:05:21.800]   My answer was, "Computer crime," smiled at him.
[03:05:21.800 --> 03:05:22.640]   (laughs)
[03:05:22.640 --> 03:05:25.760]   And it turns out, wrong thing to say
[03:05:25.760 --> 03:05:28.200]   because computer crime is not credit card theft
[03:05:28.200 --> 03:05:30.120]   or hacking or any bullshit like that.
[03:05:30.120 --> 03:05:34.120]   Computer crime in prison is child pornography.
[03:05:34.120 --> 03:05:35.440]   So tell him that.
[03:05:35.440 --> 03:05:37.720]   He looks at me like I'm a piece of shit,
[03:05:37.720 --> 03:05:38.880]   goes and gets his buddies.
[03:05:38.880 --> 03:05:40.720]   They circle around.
[03:05:40.720 --> 03:05:41.760]   "What are you in here for?"
[03:05:41.760 --> 03:05:45.040]   I like how the Aryan Brotherhood has lines.
[03:05:45.040 --> 03:05:45.880]   They're like-
[03:05:45.880 --> 03:05:46.720]   Oh yeah.
[03:05:46.720 --> 03:05:47.540]   Child porn.
[03:05:47.540 --> 03:05:48.380]   That's it.
[03:05:48.380 --> 03:05:49.960]   That's the bad guy.
[03:05:49.960 --> 03:05:50.800]   They circle around.
[03:05:50.800 --> 03:05:53.400]   They're like, "What'd you say you're in here for?"
[03:05:53.400 --> 03:05:55.760]   So I'm sitting there trying to explain it to 'em.
[03:05:55.760 --> 03:05:57.200]   They're like, "You know, you tell a good story.
[03:05:57.200 --> 03:05:59.160]   "You still said this."
[03:05:59.160 --> 03:06:02.960]   Now, computer crime basically really does mean
[03:06:02.960 --> 03:06:04.800]   usually child pornography.
[03:06:04.800 --> 03:06:05.640]   In prison, yeah.
[03:06:05.640 --> 03:06:06.480]   Yeah.
[03:06:06.480 --> 03:06:08.280]   And what you see, and that's one of the things you find out,
[03:06:08.280 --> 03:06:10.980]   the guys that are going in there for child porn,
[03:06:10.980 --> 03:06:13.800]   they will tell 'em it's credit card theft.
[03:06:13.800 --> 03:06:14.640]   Right.
[03:06:14.640 --> 03:06:15.560]   So, yeah.
[03:06:15.560 --> 03:06:16.680]   Right, they've learned.
[03:06:16.680 --> 03:06:17.960]   So I'm that guy that's-
[03:06:17.960 --> 03:06:19.320]   But you also don't, I mean,
[03:06:19.320 --> 03:06:20.840]   for people who are just listening to this,
[03:06:20.840 --> 03:06:24.800]   you don't exactly look like the typical computer hacker.
[03:06:24.800 --> 03:06:25.640]   That's true.
[03:06:25.640 --> 03:06:26.480]   That's true.
[03:06:26.480 --> 03:06:27.480]   That's very true.
[03:06:27.480 --> 03:06:29.320]   But I don't look like the pedophile either.
[03:06:29.320 --> 03:06:30.600]   That's right.
[03:06:30.600 --> 03:06:31.480]   That's right.
[03:06:31.480 --> 03:06:33.800]   But it's like it doesn't make it seem like you're,
[03:06:33.800 --> 03:06:36.000]   I mean, I guess you're not wearing a hoodie
[03:06:36.000 --> 03:06:39.960]   and you're not like emo, dark.
[03:06:39.960 --> 03:06:43.140]   The way it actually works in prison,
[03:06:43.140 --> 03:06:47.220]   they won't attack you until they know.
[03:06:47.220 --> 03:06:49.560]   All right, so they have to see paperwork,
[03:06:49.560 --> 03:06:50.920]   which now in federal prison,
[03:06:50.920 --> 03:06:54.240]   you don't get transported with paperwork because of that.
[03:06:54.240 --> 03:06:55.520]   So they have to see paperwork
[03:06:55.520 --> 03:06:59.180]   or a guard will tell them what you're in there for.
[03:06:59.180 --> 03:07:02.400]   Guards will tell who the pedophiles are.
[03:07:02.400 --> 03:07:05.920]   So none of the guards told 'em that I was anything.
[03:07:05.920 --> 03:07:08.240]   So for the first month, they think I am,
[03:07:08.240 --> 03:07:09.440]   but they're not doing anything
[03:07:09.440 --> 03:07:11.120]   'cause they don't know for sure.
[03:07:11.120 --> 03:07:12.140]   At the end of the first month,
[03:07:12.140 --> 03:07:14.280]   I had been talking to Kevin Poulsen
[03:07:14.280 --> 03:07:17.640]   over at Wired Magazine about Max Butler.
[03:07:17.640 --> 03:07:20.360]   He does an article about that, shows up in Wired Magazine.
[03:07:20.360 --> 03:07:21.360]   So at the end of the first month,
[03:07:21.360 --> 03:07:23.840]   Wired Magazine hits compound, front cover,
[03:07:23.840 --> 03:07:24.880]   all the story.
[03:07:24.880 --> 03:07:27.240]   You would think, you would think it saved me.
[03:07:27.240 --> 03:07:29.660]   So I'm reading the article, really happy about it.
[03:07:29.660 --> 03:07:31.960]   So what happens is four o'clock is mail call.
[03:07:31.960 --> 03:07:34.000]   Four o'clock's a standup count nationwide.
[03:07:34.000 --> 03:07:35.520]   After four o'clock is your mail call,
[03:07:35.520 --> 03:07:37.160]   they hand out all the mail for the day.
[03:07:37.160 --> 03:07:38.800]   So the mail comes, I get the magazine.
[03:07:38.800 --> 03:07:39.640]   I'm like reading through it, I'm like,
[03:07:39.640 --> 03:07:41.560]   "Well, shit, I'm good to go."
[03:07:41.560 --> 03:07:43.840]   Then it says, "Brett Johnson,
[03:07:43.840 --> 03:07:46.520]   "secret service informant," in the article.
[03:07:46.520 --> 03:07:49.560]   - So you're now a snitch.
[03:07:49.560 --> 03:07:51.720]   - Which is right up there with the pedophiles.
[03:07:51.720 --> 03:07:53.720]   (laughing)
[03:07:53.720 --> 03:07:55.360]   We go to dinner after that.
[03:07:55.360 --> 03:07:57.080]   At dinner, you can hear it.
[03:07:57.080 --> 03:07:58.680]   You can hear the chat, "We got a snitch.
[03:07:58.680 --> 03:08:00.960]   "I think it's that guy over there."
[03:08:00.960 --> 03:08:04.680]   Warden, next day, shuts down the entire compound.
[03:08:04.680 --> 03:08:06.060]   Calls me into his office.
[03:08:06.060 --> 03:08:07.160]   They got security there,
[03:08:07.160 --> 03:08:08.480]   you got the counselors there and everything else.
[03:08:08.480 --> 03:08:10.040]   Warden looks at me, he's like,
[03:08:10.040 --> 03:08:12.640]   "Did you give an interview to Wired Magazine?"
[03:08:12.640 --> 03:08:13.880]   I'm like, "Yeah."
[03:08:13.880 --> 03:08:17.160]   He's like, "Do you not know they will kill you in here?"
[03:08:17.160 --> 03:08:19.480]   I was like, (laughing)
[03:08:19.480 --> 03:08:21.800]   he was like, "Do you feel safe?"
[03:08:21.800 --> 03:08:24.400]   Well, I know if you tell me you don't feel safe,
[03:08:24.400 --> 03:08:25.240]   they transport you.
[03:08:25.240 --> 03:08:27.120]   Transport you means another eight months
[03:08:27.120 --> 03:08:28.640]   in solitary confinement.
[03:08:28.640 --> 03:08:31.840]   You start to see shit in solitary after a while.
[03:08:31.840 --> 03:08:33.200]   So I'm like, "No, not gonna do that."
[03:08:33.200 --> 03:08:34.920]   So I'm like, "Completely safe."
[03:08:34.920 --> 03:08:37.060]   He was like, "Look," he's like,
[03:08:37.060 --> 03:08:39.820]   "If anybody says anything to you,
[03:08:39.820 --> 03:08:42.040]   "immediately come to us
[03:08:42.040 --> 03:08:44.600]   "because they'll fucking kill you."
[03:08:44.600 --> 03:08:45.840]   So they do a locker search,
[03:08:45.840 --> 03:08:47.120]   try to confiscate the magazine.
[03:08:47.120 --> 03:08:47.960]   Say, "Can't."
[03:08:47.960 --> 03:08:50.280]   The next day, I walk into the unit.
[03:08:50.280 --> 03:08:52.200]   There's Nick Sandefur laying on his bunk,
[03:08:52.200 --> 03:08:53.960]   magazine wide open reading it.
[03:08:53.960 --> 03:08:55.640]   I'm like, "Oh shit."
[03:08:55.640 --> 03:08:57.460]   Walked up to him, I was like,
[03:08:57.460 --> 03:08:58.480]   "Hey, Nick, what are you doing?"
[03:08:58.480 --> 03:09:00.080]   He's like, "Oh, doing some reading."
[03:09:00.080 --> 03:09:01.320]   I was like, "Anything interesting?"
[03:09:01.320 --> 03:09:03.000]   He's like, "It's getting there."
[03:09:03.000 --> 03:09:03.840]   (laughing)
[03:09:03.840 --> 03:09:07.080]   I was like, "Let me save you the trouble."
[03:09:07.080 --> 03:09:08.560]   Take the magazine, turn over the page.
[03:09:08.560 --> 03:09:10.960]   I was like, "Right there is what you're looking for."
[03:09:10.960 --> 03:09:12.680]   He was like, "Man, I already knew."
[03:09:12.680 --> 03:09:15.680]   I was like, "Do we have a problem?"
[03:09:15.680 --> 03:09:18.000]   And he looks at me, he's like,
[03:09:18.000 --> 03:09:20.120]   "Is anyone on the compound you told on?"
[03:09:20.120 --> 03:09:21.280]   I was like, "No."
[03:09:21.280 --> 03:09:24.640]   He's like, "Until someone gets here you snitched on,
[03:09:24.640 --> 03:09:25.960]   we're okay."
[03:09:25.960 --> 03:09:28.120]   I was like, "Okay."
[03:09:28.120 --> 03:09:32.080]   He's like, "But I need you to do something for me."
[03:09:32.080 --> 03:09:35.240]   All right, so in federal prison, you gotta have a job.
[03:09:35.240 --> 03:09:36.080]   Everybody works.
[03:09:36.080 --> 03:09:37.560]   Doesn't matter what you do, but you gotta work.
[03:09:37.560 --> 03:09:41.200]   I got a job in education teaching a lit class.
[03:09:41.200 --> 03:09:45.280]   Every Wednesday, 6 to 8.30 p.m., lit.
[03:09:45.280 --> 03:09:48.800]   And had all, every area on the compound
[03:09:48.800 --> 03:09:50.280]   signs up for the lit class.
[03:09:50.280 --> 03:09:52.400]   Had a couple guards every now and then popped in.
[03:09:52.400 --> 03:09:54.840]   And did we teach lit?
[03:09:54.840 --> 03:09:59.840]   No, we taught fraud every Wednesday, 6 to 8.30 p.m.
[03:09:59.840 --> 03:10:02.120]   That's how I didn't get my ass beaten.
[03:10:02.120 --> 03:10:04.680]   And my other job, I had two jobs with them.
[03:10:04.680 --> 03:10:07.800]   The other job, you get to the point, it's weird, man.
[03:10:07.800 --> 03:10:11.680]   You get to the point, people walking off the bus.
[03:10:11.680 --> 03:10:13.960]   You know immediately two groups of people.
[03:10:13.960 --> 03:10:16.720]   You know who the bank robbers are, immediately.
[03:10:16.720 --> 03:10:18.080]   Just by them walking off the bus,
[03:10:18.080 --> 03:10:20.360]   you're like, "That motherfucker's a bank robber."
[03:10:20.360 --> 03:10:23.560]   And you know who the pedophiles are, immediately.
[03:10:23.560 --> 03:10:26.320]   So my job as the white guy
[03:10:26.320 --> 03:10:28.720]   was to approach the white pedophiles
[03:10:28.720 --> 03:10:29.840]   and have a conversation.
[03:10:29.840 --> 03:10:30.960]   And the conversation was basically,
[03:10:30.960 --> 03:10:34.600]   "Hey, don't know what you in here for.
[03:10:34.600 --> 03:10:36.880]   "Don't care what you in here for.
[03:10:36.880 --> 03:10:40.000]   "But if you got some sort of fucked up charge,
[03:10:40.000 --> 03:10:42.000]   "you need to tell me.
[03:10:42.000 --> 03:10:46.240]   "If you tell me, everything's gonna be all right.
[03:10:46.240 --> 03:10:49.380]   "If you don't tell me, you see those guys over there?
[03:10:49.380 --> 03:10:51.120]   "If you start to associate with them,
[03:10:51.120 --> 03:10:52.520]   "or they start to talk to you,
[03:10:52.520 --> 03:10:55.400]   "and then they find out you're in here on something,
[03:10:55.400 --> 03:10:57.240]   "they're gonna kill you."
[03:10:57.240 --> 03:10:58.120]   And what are the things?
[03:10:58.120 --> 03:10:59.600]   Pedophile.
[03:10:59.600 --> 03:11:02.640]   Pedophile, rapist, anything that harms children,
[03:11:02.640 --> 03:11:04.720]   harms women, anything like that.
[03:11:04.720 --> 03:11:07.120]   There are, it's like the mob.
[03:11:07.120 --> 03:11:10.440]   There's rules, there's an ethical code.
[03:11:10.440 --> 03:11:14.160]   Even if you have the division between races on all that,
[03:11:15.160 --> 03:11:17.760]   you still have these lines drawn.
[03:11:17.760 --> 03:11:19.680]   And there's a hierarchy too.
[03:11:19.680 --> 03:11:20.520]   Very, very much so.
[03:11:20.520 --> 03:11:22.000]   And what that looks like in prison,
[03:11:22.000 --> 03:11:25.080]   depending on the, it depends on the security class
[03:11:25.080 --> 03:11:27.640]   that you're in, what level prison.
[03:11:27.640 --> 03:11:31.040]   But at that prison, what that looked like was,
[03:11:31.040 --> 03:11:33.360]   you're not allowed to talk to anybody.
[03:11:33.360 --> 03:11:35.520]   You're not allowed to watch television.
[03:11:35.520 --> 03:11:37.300]   You can go to the library.
[03:11:37.300 --> 03:11:40.740]   You don't associate with anyone except your own type.
[03:11:40.740 --> 03:11:43.740]   If you do anything like this, we will kill you.
[03:11:44.640 --> 03:11:49.200]   If someone wants to extort you, we will do that too,
[03:11:49.200 --> 03:11:52.680]   and you won't tell on us, or we'll kill you.
[03:11:52.680 --> 03:11:55.480]   So that's the way that works at that point.
[03:11:55.480 --> 03:11:58.120]   And everybody quickly learns this.
[03:11:58.120 --> 03:11:59.680]   Quickly, quickly.
[03:11:59.680 --> 03:12:02.360]   And so typically the guys would say,
[03:12:02.360 --> 03:12:03.700]   "I just wanna do my own time."
[03:12:03.700 --> 03:12:05.120]   That would be the line.
[03:12:05.120 --> 03:12:08.440]   And it's like, okay, don't mess with him, all right?
[03:12:08.440 --> 03:12:11.760]   Every now and then you'd have somebody lie,
[03:12:11.760 --> 03:12:14.560]   and that would come with those types of consequences.
[03:12:14.560 --> 03:12:17.740]   I got to see, while I was there,
[03:12:17.740 --> 03:12:20.040]   saw two people murdered,
[03:12:20.040 --> 03:12:23.160]   saw, went through three prison riots,
[03:12:23.160 --> 03:12:25.200]   and through my entire tenure in prison,
[03:12:25.200 --> 03:12:26.960]   saw four suicides.
[03:12:26.960 --> 03:12:29.840]   The people who got killed, it was,
[03:12:29.840 --> 03:12:32.000]   so we had, outside you had this track,
[03:12:32.000 --> 03:12:33.420]   third of a mile track.
[03:12:33.420 --> 03:12:35.720]   You walk it counterclockwise,
[03:12:35.720 --> 03:12:38.200]   and inside of the track you got two handball courts.
[03:12:38.200 --> 03:12:41.620]   So of an evening, it happened both times,
[03:12:41.620 --> 03:12:45.160]   you, all of us would be walking, doing our exercises,
[03:12:45.160 --> 03:12:47.680]   and at the top of the key, like a flock of birds,
[03:12:47.680 --> 03:12:51.080]   you'd see all the inmates start to migrate down
[03:12:51.080 --> 03:12:52.000]   toward the gate.
[03:12:52.000 --> 03:12:55.240]   So the first time you see that, you see that migration,
[03:12:55.240 --> 03:12:56.340]   you look up in the distance,
[03:12:56.340 --> 03:12:59.900]   and this other, one of the inmates got another inmate down,
[03:12:59.900 --> 03:13:02.840]   and he's just hammering his head right into the pavement,
[03:13:02.840 --> 03:13:04.000]   like that right there.
[03:13:04.000 --> 03:13:05.600]   Well, guards don't stop that,
[03:13:05.600 --> 03:13:07.440]   because a guard may get hurt.
[03:13:07.440 --> 03:13:11.660]   So a guard, it's 15 minutes coming out to stop that,
[03:13:11.660 --> 03:13:12.500]   until everything's over.
[03:13:12.500 --> 03:13:15.260]   By that point, the guy doesn't have a head.
[03:13:15.260 --> 03:13:17.740]   They shut the compound down, and this is what happens.
[03:13:17.740 --> 03:13:20.020]   So you shut the entire compound down,
[03:13:20.020 --> 03:13:22.740]   they make two lines of the inmates,
[03:13:22.740 --> 03:13:25.780]   and what happens is, the inmate walks into a room,
[03:13:25.780 --> 03:13:27.300]   they shut the door behind the inmate,
[03:13:27.300 --> 03:13:28.660]   guard asks them two questions.
[03:13:28.660 --> 03:13:30.340]   First question is, did you see anything?
[03:13:30.340 --> 03:13:31.620]   The answer is no.
[03:13:31.620 --> 03:13:34.140]   Second question is, if you had seen anything,
[03:13:34.140 --> 03:13:35.460]   would you say anything?
[03:13:35.460 --> 03:13:36.620]   Answer is no.
[03:13:36.620 --> 03:13:38.480]   Guard then says, get the fuck out.
[03:13:38.480 --> 03:13:40.080]   And that's it.
[03:13:40.080 --> 03:13:42.980]   Anybody that stays in any longer than that,
[03:13:42.980 --> 03:13:45.820]   is automatically suspect.
[03:13:45.820 --> 03:13:49.560]   So there was one incident, I remember this Hispanic guy,
[03:13:49.560 --> 03:13:51.640]   he's in there for a few minutes.
[03:13:51.640 --> 03:13:55.880]   And everybody's like, what's going on?
[03:13:55.880 --> 03:13:56.720]   (laughs)
[03:13:56.720 --> 03:13:59.440]   So his people then call him over,
[03:13:59.440 --> 03:14:01.200]   explain to us what went on.
[03:14:01.200 --> 03:14:02.040]   - Yeah.
[03:14:02.040 --> 03:14:03.200]   - And it happens like that.
[03:14:03.200 --> 03:14:05.080]   - It's fascinating, 'cause you talked about
[03:14:05.080 --> 03:14:10.080]   the network of trust in the cyber crime community.
[03:14:10.080 --> 03:14:12.540]   And here's a network of trust.
[03:14:12.540 --> 03:14:13.380]   - Absolutely.
[03:14:13.380 --> 03:14:15.060]   - In the prison crime community.
[03:14:15.060 --> 03:14:16.340]   - Absolutely.
[03:14:16.340 --> 03:14:17.460]   - Trust.
[03:14:17.460 --> 03:14:19.000]   - Trust matters.
[03:14:19.000 --> 03:14:21.140]   Trust drives everything at the end of the day.
[03:14:21.140 --> 03:14:23.100]   The riots that I went through,
[03:14:23.100 --> 03:14:26.340]   the first riot, man, you're scared to death.
[03:14:26.340 --> 03:14:27.540]   Scared to death.
[03:14:27.540 --> 03:14:29.440]   You know, you've got the cops dressed up
[03:14:29.440 --> 03:14:30.700]   in the Ninja Turtle outfits,
[03:14:30.700 --> 03:14:34.540]   you've got the rubber bullets, the tear gas canisters,
[03:14:34.540 --> 03:14:36.380]   all that crap, you've got the inmates
[03:14:36.380 --> 03:14:39.260]   that are raised in hell, scared to death.
[03:14:39.260 --> 03:14:42.420]   The second riot, you calm down.
[03:14:42.420 --> 03:14:44.660]   Second riot, you start to notice.
[03:14:44.660 --> 03:14:46.200]   This is a racial riot.
[03:14:46.200 --> 03:14:48.700]   This is typically, and almost always,
[03:14:48.700 --> 03:14:50.860]   it's Hispanics and African Americans.
[03:14:50.860 --> 03:14:54.500]   - So you get to detect what is the motivation for the riot,
[03:14:54.500 --> 03:14:56.620]   what is the reason, and that gives you some calm.
[03:14:56.620 --> 03:14:57.460]   - That's exactly right.
[03:14:57.460 --> 03:14:58.740]   So the second riot, you start to notice this.
[03:14:58.740 --> 03:15:02.700]   Hey, man, this ain't me, this ain't our group.
[03:15:02.700 --> 03:15:05.760]   Third riot, no shit, third riot, you lay in your bunk.
[03:15:05.760 --> 03:15:07.900]   (laughing)
[03:15:07.900 --> 03:15:10.740]   You let 'em wage war all around you,
[03:15:10.740 --> 03:15:12.100]   and every now and then you have an inmate
[03:15:12.100 --> 03:15:13.700]   that'll run up to you and he'll point to a locker,
[03:15:13.700 --> 03:15:14.820]   he'll say, "Is that your locker?"
[03:15:14.820 --> 03:15:16.860]   And if you tell him yes, they leave it alone.
[03:15:16.860 --> 03:15:18.020]   If you say, "It's not my locker,"
[03:15:18.020 --> 03:15:20.100]   they'll break into it and steal everything out of it
[03:15:20.100 --> 03:15:21.540]   and go from there.
[03:15:21.540 --> 03:15:22.700]   And that's what happens.
[03:15:22.700 --> 03:15:23.540]   But--
[03:15:23.540 --> 03:15:25.460]   - So you did your time for five years.
[03:15:25.460 --> 03:15:26.300]   - Five and a half.
[03:15:26.300 --> 03:15:27.980]   - Five and a half.
[03:15:27.980 --> 03:15:28.900]   You made it out.
[03:15:28.900 --> 03:15:29.740]   - Made it out.
[03:15:29.740 --> 03:15:31.780]   I went through, I told you it was a good lie
[03:15:31.780 --> 03:15:32.940]   that I told, I went through
[03:15:32.940 --> 03:15:35.740]   the Residential Drug Abuse Program.
[03:15:35.740 --> 03:15:37.900]   It's a nine-month intensive therapy.
[03:15:37.900 --> 03:15:42.220]   And the way I got to that, this counselor at Big Spring,
[03:15:42.220 --> 03:15:44.740]   he bought this.
[03:15:44.740 --> 03:15:46.900]   He wanted inmates to be educated.
[03:15:46.900 --> 03:15:48.320]   He was a really good guy.
[03:15:48.320 --> 03:15:49.700]   So he wanted inmates to be educated.
[03:15:49.700 --> 03:15:54.700]   He got a discount on a game theory class set.
[03:15:54.700 --> 03:15:56.780]   So he gets all these discs and everything,
[03:15:56.780 --> 03:15:59.420]   and he's asking, "Does anybody on the compound
[03:15:59.420 --> 03:16:01.060]   "know anything about game theory?"
[03:16:01.060 --> 03:16:03.460]   And somebody says, "If anybody does,
[03:16:03.460 --> 03:16:04.820]   "it'll be Brett Johnson."
[03:16:04.820 --> 03:16:07.540]   So he comes up to me one day at my buggy,
[03:16:07.540 --> 03:16:09.140]   he's like, "Are you Brett Johnson?"
[03:16:09.140 --> 03:16:09.980]   I was like, "Yeah."
[03:16:09.980 --> 03:16:12.700]   He was like, "Do you know anything about game theory?"
[03:16:12.700 --> 03:16:14.580]   And I was like, "Yes, I do."
[03:16:14.580 --> 03:16:15.420]   (laughing)
[03:16:15.420 --> 03:16:17.260]   So I start rattling off Prisoner's Dilemma
[03:16:17.260 --> 03:16:18.100]   and everything else.
[03:16:18.100 --> 03:16:20.100]   He's like, "Will you teach the class?"
[03:16:20.100 --> 03:16:21.140]   So I start teaching that.
[03:16:21.140 --> 03:16:23.420]   I start teaching inmates public speaking
[03:16:23.420 --> 03:16:26.640]   and to make friends with this counselor.
[03:16:26.640 --> 03:16:28.820]   So it gets to the time where I'm supposed
[03:16:28.820 --> 03:16:30.580]   to be transferring out to this drug program
[03:16:30.580 --> 03:16:32.900]   that they only had in Fort Worth,
[03:16:32.900 --> 03:16:36.460]   and the transfers are taking like four or five months.
[03:16:36.460 --> 03:16:39.300]   That's four or five months I could be out free.
[03:16:39.300 --> 03:16:40.940]   So I went up to him one day and I was like,
[03:16:40.940 --> 03:16:42.500]   "Look," his name was Keely, I was like,
[03:16:42.500 --> 03:16:45.260]   "Look, man," I said, "Is there any way
[03:16:45.260 --> 03:16:47.100]   "that I can get transferred out any sooner?"
[03:16:47.100 --> 03:16:50.780]   And he looks at me, he's like, "Brett, I cannot help you."
[03:16:50.780 --> 03:16:51.980]   And I was like, "I appreciate that.
[03:16:51.980 --> 03:16:53.860]   "Thank you so much for even trying."
[03:16:53.860 --> 03:16:57.260]   So he said that, a week later, I'm on a bus
[03:16:57.260 --> 03:16:59.260]   going to Fort Worth.
[03:16:59.260 --> 03:17:00.100]   So he got me to Fort Worth.
[03:17:00.100 --> 03:17:00.940]   - I got you.
[03:17:00.940 --> 03:17:02.060]   - Yeah. - I love it.
[03:17:02.060 --> 03:17:04.260]   - So it was a nine-month program,
[03:17:04.260 --> 03:17:06.700]   24 hours a day of cognitive behavioral therapy.
[03:17:06.700 --> 03:17:07.820]   Had nothing to do with drugs.
[03:17:07.820 --> 03:17:12.060]   It was all peer study stuff and CBT training.
[03:17:12.060 --> 03:17:15.940]   And honestly, it's the best thing that could ever happen.
[03:17:15.940 --> 03:17:16.780]   Truly is.
[03:17:16.780 --> 03:17:19.840]   - Well, that part, what was the thing
[03:17:19.840 --> 03:17:21.620]   that changed you as a man?
[03:17:21.620 --> 03:17:23.540]   Is it the solitary confinement?
[03:17:23.540 --> 03:17:24.660]   Was it the years?
[03:17:24.660 --> 03:17:28.820]   Was it losing the people you loved?
[03:17:28.820 --> 03:17:30.620]   Or was it that behavioral therapy?
[03:17:30.620 --> 03:17:31.940]   - It's a combination, man.
[03:17:31.940 --> 03:17:32.940]   It's a combination.
[03:17:32.940 --> 03:17:36.500]   So my sister disowns me.
[03:17:36.500 --> 03:17:38.300]   The only person I had in my life.
[03:17:38.300 --> 03:17:41.420]   I mean, me and my sister, that's it.
[03:17:41.420 --> 03:17:43.860]   I mean, I loved Elizabeth, I love my wife now,
[03:17:43.860 --> 03:17:47.100]   but it's me and my sister.
[03:17:47.100 --> 03:17:49.260]   We went through all that shit together.
[03:17:49.260 --> 03:17:50.300]   So Denise disowns me.
[03:17:50.300 --> 03:17:52.900]   She doesn't talk to me for an entire year
[03:17:52.900 --> 03:17:54.660]   when all this stuff happens.
[03:17:54.660 --> 03:17:58.940]   And after I get arrested on the escape,
[03:17:58.940 --> 03:18:01.620]   she ends up driving seven hours to come see me
[03:18:01.620 --> 03:18:02.500]   to tell me she loves me.
[03:18:02.500 --> 03:18:04.920]   And I don't see her again for five and a half years.
[03:18:04.920 --> 03:18:05.760]   Yeah.
[03:18:05.760 --> 03:18:07.900]   So that's really the first turnaround.
[03:18:07.900 --> 03:18:10.300]   Took me two and a half years in prison
[03:18:10.300 --> 03:18:12.700]   to accept responsibility.
[03:18:12.700 --> 03:18:13.540]   Two and a half.
[03:18:13.540 --> 03:18:14.660]   - That was amazing that she did that.
[03:18:14.660 --> 03:18:15.500]   - Yeah.
[03:18:15.500 --> 03:18:16.500]   - She drove down.
[03:18:16.500 --> 03:18:17.340]   - Yeah.
[03:18:17.340 --> 03:18:18.160]   - She did that.
[03:18:18.160 --> 03:18:19.000]   - Yeah, she's something.
[03:18:19.000 --> 03:18:19.820]   She's something.
[03:18:19.820 --> 03:18:20.900]   Yeah, she saw me for 10 minutes,
[03:18:20.900 --> 03:18:23.140]   tell me she loves me, and then I don't see her.
[03:18:23.140 --> 03:18:24.100]   - Planted the seed.
[03:18:24.100 --> 03:18:24.940]   - Yeah, yeah.
[03:18:24.940 --> 03:18:26.580]   (laughing)
[03:18:26.580 --> 03:18:29.300]   - But yeah, you had time to think over those years.
[03:18:29.300 --> 03:18:31.300]   - Took two and a half years to realize
[03:18:31.300 --> 03:18:34.140]   that I didn't commit crime because of stripper girlfriends
[03:18:34.140 --> 03:18:35.340]   or wives or family.
[03:18:35.340 --> 03:18:38.180]   I committed it 'cause I wanted to, chose to.
[03:18:38.180 --> 03:18:42.060]   And that's the first turnaround.
[03:18:42.060 --> 03:18:44.780]   Second turnaround is the CBT training.
[03:18:44.780 --> 03:18:50.140]   It didn't really hit while I was in prison.
[03:18:50.140 --> 03:18:52.140]   I went through it and they ingrained it in you,
[03:18:52.140 --> 03:18:56.740]   but until you choose to make it work, it doesn't work.
[03:18:56.740 --> 03:19:00.500]   So I got out in 2011, didn't wanna break the law, did not.
[03:19:00.500 --> 03:19:02.900]   And I was under three years probation,
[03:19:02.900 --> 03:19:04.620]   couldn't touch a computer.
[03:19:04.620 --> 03:19:07.420]   I had a job offer from Deloitte
[03:19:07.420 --> 03:19:10.740]   to run a cyber crime office in the UK,
[03:19:10.740 --> 03:19:11.820]   which that was a no.
[03:19:11.820 --> 03:19:13.900]   No, you're not moving and that's a computer, idiot.
[03:19:13.900 --> 03:19:18.260]   So then I had a job offer from Know Before,
[03:19:18.260 --> 03:19:20.660]   a fishing company, couldn't take that.
[03:19:20.660 --> 03:19:24.020]   I got to where I was trying to apply for fast food jobs.
[03:19:24.020 --> 03:19:26.420]   That's a computer, can't touch that.
[03:19:26.420 --> 03:19:28.780]   Okay, then what about a waiter's position?
[03:19:28.780 --> 03:19:31.740]   Well, that's a computer and access to credit cards, idiot.
[03:19:31.740 --> 03:19:33.460]   Can't touch that either.
[03:19:33.460 --> 03:19:36.540]   So literally could not get a job, could not.
[03:19:36.540 --> 03:19:40.020]   Doing food stamps, I had a roommate
[03:19:40.020 --> 03:19:42.540]   that penned half the rent.
[03:19:42.540 --> 03:19:45.260]   They tell you when you leave prison to get a job
[03:19:45.260 --> 03:19:48.060]   and something you care about and you won't recidivate.
[03:19:48.060 --> 03:19:50.340]   Couldn't get a job and what I had was a cat.
[03:19:50.340 --> 03:19:54.660]   Monster the Cat, that was the cat's name.
[03:19:54.660 --> 03:19:56.900]   That's a good name.
[03:19:56.900 --> 03:19:59.620]   Yeah, I had enough money to feed that little guy
[03:19:59.620 --> 03:20:02.740]   and didn't have money to buy toilet paper for the apartment.
[03:20:02.740 --> 03:20:05.340]   So I was on Panama City Beach.
[03:20:05.340 --> 03:20:07.380]   How long were you living like this?
[03:20:07.380 --> 03:20:09.340]   It was a steady decline 'cause remember,
[03:20:09.340 --> 03:20:11.420]   I taught my dad how to commit tax fraud.
[03:20:11.420 --> 03:20:14.300]   So he bankrolled a lot of that until he couldn't.
[03:20:14.300 --> 03:20:18.180]   And then from there, it's like, what the fuck do you do?
[03:20:18.180 --> 03:20:20.780]   So I didn't wanna go into computer crime at all
[03:20:20.780 --> 03:20:25.220]   and I ended up shoplifting toilet paper, man.
[03:20:25.220 --> 03:20:26.540]   Shoplifting toilet paper.
[03:20:26.540 --> 03:20:30.620]   Just like for the basics, the basics of survival.
[03:20:30.620 --> 03:20:35.220]   So about the same time, I had a friend that, this guy.
[03:20:35.220 --> 03:20:37.740]   I'd been dating the same type of women I had been dating.
[03:20:37.740 --> 03:20:41.540]   You know, the unhealthy ones, the hot unhealthy ones.
[03:20:41.540 --> 03:20:43.500]   Yes, love.
[03:20:43.500 --> 03:20:44.980]   Yeah. That's how that works.
[03:20:44.980 --> 03:20:48.980]   So I had a friend post an ad for me on Plenty of Fish
[03:20:48.980 --> 03:20:53.100]   and this woman responds, my wife, she responds.
[03:20:53.100 --> 03:20:56.500]   And the pictures I had taken were these prison type pictures,
[03:20:56.500 --> 03:20:58.980]   you know, the serious like, they were there.
[03:20:58.980 --> 03:21:01.460]   She sends me a message of, "Why aren't you smiling?"
[03:21:01.460 --> 03:21:04.260]   And my response was, "That is my happy face."
[03:21:04.260 --> 03:21:08.340]   So we started talking and we started dating
[03:21:08.340 --> 03:21:12.140]   and she's that second saving thing, man.
[03:21:13.300 --> 03:21:14.980]   I ended up moving in with her.
[03:21:14.980 --> 03:21:16.540]   I was going broke, I was about to get kicked out
[03:21:16.540 --> 03:21:17.620]   of the apartment and everything else.
[03:21:17.620 --> 03:21:19.980]   And she didn't say it, but I think she knew it.
[03:21:19.980 --> 03:21:24.980]   And moved in with her and I got a job.
[03:21:24.980 --> 03:21:30.060]   And the job I got, my probation officer
[03:21:30.060 --> 03:21:31.540]   let me have a cell phone.
[03:21:31.540 --> 03:21:32.860]   I was going through Craigslist,
[03:21:32.860 --> 03:21:35.060]   this guy was advertising for landscaping,
[03:21:35.060 --> 03:21:38.100]   called him up, his name was Dustin Doremus.
[03:21:38.100 --> 03:21:40.020]   Called him up and he was like, "Come on down and talk to me."
[03:21:40.020 --> 03:21:41.220]   So he was running this business,
[03:21:41.220 --> 03:21:43.780]   him and his brother were, out of his house.
[03:21:43.780 --> 03:21:46.180]   So I'm sitting there talking to him for about 20 minutes.
[03:21:46.180 --> 03:21:48.060]   He looks at me, he's like, "Can I ask you a question?"
[03:21:48.060 --> 03:21:49.340]   I was like, "Yeah."
[03:21:49.340 --> 03:21:52.020]   He's like, "Are you on the run or something?"
[03:21:52.020 --> 03:21:54.100]   So I'm like, "No, why?"
[03:21:54.100 --> 03:21:55.220]   And he's like, "Well, you just don't look
[03:21:55.220 --> 03:21:57.980]   "like the kind of guy that'd do this."
[03:21:57.980 --> 03:21:59.860]   So I told him, I was like, "This is who I am,
[03:21:59.860 --> 03:22:00.980]   "this is what I've done."
[03:22:00.980 --> 03:22:03.700]   And he looks at me, he's like,
[03:22:03.700 --> 03:22:05.780]   "Man, I gotta think about that."
[03:22:05.780 --> 03:22:09.780]   So he tells me to go on home, that was a Friday.
[03:22:09.780 --> 03:22:12.060]   Sunday evening he gives me a call and he was like,
[03:22:12.060 --> 03:22:17.060]   "Brett, if I hire you, will you actually work?"
[03:22:17.060 --> 03:22:19.900]   And I told him, I was like, "Dustin, if you'll give me a job,
[03:22:19.900 --> 03:22:22.460]   "I promise I'll work my ass off."
[03:22:22.460 --> 03:22:24.100]   And he's like, "Show up six o'clock."
[03:22:24.100 --> 03:22:25.140]   I was like, "All right."
[03:22:25.140 --> 03:22:29.020]   So my job was to push a lawnmower 10 hours a day,
[03:22:29.020 --> 03:22:33.260]   five days a week for $400 a week, and busted my ass.
[03:22:33.260 --> 03:22:34.820]   I hit it so hard I would,
[03:22:36.580 --> 03:22:40.220]   I'd come in of a night and pass out,
[03:22:40.220 --> 03:22:42.220]   wake up the next morning and hit it again.
[03:22:42.220 --> 03:22:44.660]   And it got to the point,
[03:22:44.660 --> 03:22:49.140]   he ended up, this dude ended up offering me
[03:22:49.140 --> 03:22:51.140]   to come in and partner with his business.
[03:22:51.140 --> 03:22:53.340]   His brother dropped out and he,
[03:22:53.340 --> 03:22:55.500]   by that point I'd learned everything on the business
[03:22:55.500 --> 03:22:56.860]   and everything and he was like,
[03:22:56.860 --> 03:22:59.740]   "You know, if you'd like to come in, I'll cut you in half."
[03:22:59.740 --> 03:23:02.540]   And I was like, "Dustin, I can't do it, man."
[03:23:02.540 --> 03:23:03.740]   'Cause I wasn't making any money,
[03:23:03.740 --> 03:23:05.180]   he didn't wanna pay me anymore
[03:23:05.180 --> 03:23:07.460]   until he was able to do more.
[03:23:07.460 --> 03:23:12.460]   And I thought I found another job doing something else.
[03:23:12.460 --> 03:23:14.260]   And in a speech, I say it got cold
[03:23:14.260 --> 03:23:15.580]   and the grass started, stopped growing.
[03:23:15.580 --> 03:23:16.460]   The truth of the matter was,
[03:23:16.460 --> 03:23:18.540]   is I thought I found another job.
[03:23:18.540 --> 03:23:21.780]   A guy was offering to pay me $1,500 a week
[03:23:21.780 --> 03:23:26.620]   doing the sales for oil rig training, was what it was.
[03:23:26.620 --> 03:23:31.620]   And I accepted the job, I quit working for Dustin.
[03:23:31.900 --> 03:23:36.460]   And the guy, I told him before he even offered me a job,
[03:23:36.460 --> 03:23:38.140]   I told him my criminal history
[03:23:38.140 --> 03:23:39.780]   'cause I was required to do that.
[03:23:39.780 --> 03:23:42.340]   So I was supposed to start work,
[03:23:42.340 --> 03:23:44.660]   well, he calls me and tells me he can't hire me.
[03:23:44.660 --> 03:23:46.780]   So I'm out of work.
[03:23:46.780 --> 03:23:49.060]   And Dustin's already hired somebody else by that point,
[03:23:49.060 --> 03:23:50.460]   so I can't go back with him.
[03:23:50.460 --> 03:23:54.540]   And I'm that guy again, man.
[03:23:58.820 --> 03:24:03.540]   It's important for me to show value in a relationship.
[03:24:03.540 --> 03:24:05.620]   All right?
[03:24:05.620 --> 03:24:08.580]   So Michelle was the only one working.
[03:24:08.580 --> 03:24:12.220]   I'm like, I gotta do something.
[03:24:12.220 --> 03:24:15.100]   And I get it in my head, I was like,
[03:24:15.100 --> 03:24:17.740]   if nothing else, I can just bring food in the house.
[03:24:17.740 --> 03:24:20.020]   She was only making, I think she was,
[03:24:20.020 --> 03:24:23.420]   I mean, we were at it hard, it was just her working.
[03:24:23.420 --> 03:24:25.100]   And I was like, if nothing else,
[03:24:25.100 --> 03:24:26.600]   I can bring food in the house.
[03:24:27.820 --> 03:24:31.620]   And get on the dark web, get some stolen credit cards,
[03:24:31.620 --> 03:24:33.660]   start ordering food.
[03:24:33.660 --> 03:24:35.220]   Well, it gets worse than that.
[03:24:35.220 --> 03:24:38.860]   She's got two sons there, so I'm like,
[03:24:38.860 --> 03:24:40.460]   well, they need clothes.
[03:24:40.460 --> 03:24:42.900]   So he starts stealing clothes.
[03:24:42.900 --> 03:24:44.300]   And it continues like that.
[03:24:44.300 --> 03:24:45.180]   I get arrested.
[03:24:45.180 --> 03:24:47.460]   I get arrested on a food order.
[03:24:47.460 --> 03:24:51.740]   And Michelle didn't know what I was doing.
[03:24:51.740 --> 03:24:55.980]   So she had been to work and she was coming back from work,
[03:24:55.980 --> 03:24:57.380]   I get arrested and I'm like,
[03:24:57.380 --> 03:24:59.340]   they let me make a phone call.
[03:24:59.340 --> 03:25:00.300]   And I call her and I was like,
[03:25:00.300 --> 03:25:02.300]   come to the police station, I've been arrested.
[03:25:02.300 --> 03:25:06.860]   And she shows up and she didn't know I'd been doing that.
[03:25:06.860 --> 03:25:07.940]   My probation officer, of course,
[03:25:07.940 --> 03:25:09.540]   he didn't know or anything else.
[03:25:09.540 --> 03:25:14.020]   At my sentencing for that,
[03:25:14.020 --> 03:25:16.780]   probation officer was there, prosecutor,
[03:25:16.780 --> 03:25:21.260]   the judge, US Marshals, Michelle and me.
[03:25:21.260 --> 03:25:23.300]   Michelle stands up and she tells the judge
[03:25:23.300 --> 03:25:25.020]   that I'm a better dad to her kids
[03:25:25.020 --> 03:25:26.940]   than their actual father is.
[03:25:26.940 --> 03:25:31.620]   And by that point I'm crying.
[03:25:31.620 --> 03:25:37.060]   Probation officer stands up and he was like,
[03:25:37.060 --> 03:25:39.340]   we think Mr. Johnson's a good guy.
[03:25:39.340 --> 03:25:40.660]   We think this is a one-time thing.
[03:25:40.660 --> 03:25:42.220]   Prosecutor says the same thing.
[03:25:42.220 --> 03:25:46.060]   Judge sentences me to one year.
[03:25:46.060 --> 03:25:50.120]   Probation officer stands back up and he was like,
[03:25:50.120 --> 03:25:54.500]   Mr. Johnson, judge, if you can give Mr. Johnson
[03:25:54.500 --> 03:25:57.500]   a year and a day, he can get the good time
[03:25:57.500 --> 03:25:59.500]   and get back to his family sooner.
[03:25:59.500 --> 03:26:01.980]   So the judge amends the sentence to a year and a day.
[03:26:01.980 --> 03:26:03.100]   So I served 10 months.
[03:26:03.100 --> 03:26:04.980]   They sent me back to Texas.
[03:26:04.980 --> 03:26:08.100]   And that's when I find out that Michelle
[03:26:08.100 --> 03:26:10.460]   didn't need me for what I could give her.
[03:26:10.460 --> 03:26:12.100]   She just wanted me for me that entire time.
[03:26:12.100 --> 03:26:13.820]   She stands by me the entire time.
[03:26:13.820 --> 03:26:18.140]   I do my 10 months, get out, we get married after that.
[03:26:18.140 --> 03:26:20.180]   And they kill probation.
[03:26:20.180 --> 03:26:21.300]   So I can touch a computer.
[03:26:21.300 --> 03:26:22.940]   They tell you, they tell you.
[03:26:22.940 --> 03:26:26.780]   They were like, inmates, a felon, if nothing else,
[03:26:26.780 --> 03:26:28.540]   he can sell cars.
[03:26:28.540 --> 03:26:30.540]   Well, it turns out you can't.
[03:26:30.540 --> 03:26:32.660]   You can sell cars if you're a drug dealer.
[03:26:32.660 --> 03:26:33.900]   If you're the guy that steals all the money
[03:26:33.900 --> 03:26:35.740]   and people's information, no, fuck no.
[03:26:35.740 --> 03:26:38.000]   You can't get a job selling cars.
[03:26:38.000 --> 03:26:40.700]   So I can't get a job, cannot.
[03:26:40.700 --> 03:26:45.100]   And to this day, Lex, I know what my triggers are.
[03:26:45.100 --> 03:26:46.540]   I know what it would take to get me back
[03:26:46.540 --> 03:26:48.380]   into committing crime.
[03:26:48.380 --> 03:26:50.140]   So I knew I'd go so far at that point.
[03:26:50.140 --> 03:26:51.300]   So I looked at Michelle and I was like,
[03:26:51.300 --> 03:26:52.540]   let me see what I can do.
[03:26:53.100 --> 03:26:56.940]   Signed on to LinkedIn, reached out to this FBI super cop
[03:26:56.940 --> 03:26:58.980]   named Keith Malarski out of the Pittsburgh office.
[03:26:58.980 --> 03:27:02.380]   He was involved with my arrest and some associates
[03:27:02.380 --> 03:27:05.300]   and everything else and sent him a message.
[03:27:05.300 --> 03:27:07.820]   And the message was, hey, I respect everything you did.
[03:27:07.820 --> 03:27:09.780]   Think you did a great job.
[03:27:09.780 --> 03:27:12.460]   By the way, I'd like to be legal.
[03:27:12.460 --> 03:27:16.300]   And dude responded within two hours.
[03:27:16.300 --> 03:27:19.420]   Two hours, he gives me references, advice,
[03:27:19.420 --> 03:27:22.220]   takes me in under his wing, everything else like that.
[03:27:22.220 --> 03:27:24.260]   And from that point, man, it was the head
[03:27:24.260 --> 03:27:26.700]   of the Identity Theft Council did the same thing.
[03:27:26.700 --> 03:27:31.540]   Cardnot Present Group hires me to speak.
[03:27:31.540 --> 03:27:34.460]   Microsoft hires me to consult with them.
[03:27:34.460 --> 03:27:37.580]   And the Microsoft hire established enough trust
[03:27:37.580 --> 03:27:40.940]   in the industry that I was all right from that point.
[03:27:40.940 --> 03:27:45.620]   - So now you're helping in many ways fight
[03:27:45.620 --> 03:27:48.740]   the very guy that you used to be.
[03:27:48.740 --> 03:27:53.740]   So big picture advice, given that you were that guy,
[03:27:53.740 --> 03:27:58.140]   how do we fight cyber crime today
[03:27:58.140 --> 03:28:01.940]   and in the next five years, 10 years, 20 years, 50 years?
[03:28:01.940 --> 03:28:03.460]   What advice do you have to individuals,
[03:28:03.460 --> 03:28:08.460]   to companies, to governments, and also to Elizabeth?
[03:28:08.460 --> 03:28:13.460]   (laughing)
[03:28:13.460 --> 03:28:18.460]   Like the humans, human beings that are in the world
[03:28:18.460 --> 03:28:23.460]   that love, that live, that are friends with cyber criminals?
[03:28:23.460 --> 03:28:29.000]   - There's so many lessons to really be had from that.
[03:28:29.000 --> 03:28:33.460]   To me, the lesson, one of the big lessons to me
[03:28:33.460 --> 03:28:37.280]   is you can't serve two masters.
[03:28:37.280 --> 03:28:41.220]   If you're that guy that is committing crime
[03:28:41.220 --> 03:28:43.380]   or that person that's addicted,
[03:28:43.380 --> 03:28:48.240]   or you're in love with somebody that's addicted or has that,
[03:28:48.240 --> 03:28:49.340]   they don't love you.
[03:28:49.340 --> 03:28:50.660]   They love that addiction.
[03:28:50.660 --> 03:28:51.540]   That comes first.
[03:28:51.540 --> 03:28:53.080]   It's always gonna come first.
[03:28:53.080 --> 03:28:54.660]   So you have to realize that.
[03:28:54.660 --> 03:28:55.940]   You have to know when to,
[03:28:55.940 --> 03:29:01.220]   you gotta know when to cut somebody off,
[03:29:01.220 --> 03:29:02.340]   when to end something,
[03:29:02.340 --> 03:29:06.100]   knowing that they're not gonna change
[03:29:06.100 --> 03:29:08.540]   until they decide to change.
[03:29:08.540 --> 03:29:09.900]   At the same time, you gotta realize
[03:29:09.900 --> 03:29:13.420]   that the only reason I was able to turn my life around
[03:29:13.420 --> 03:29:15.460]   is because people took that chance on me.
[03:29:15.460 --> 03:29:17.820]   That's really the only reason.
[03:29:17.820 --> 03:29:19.640]   - They believe that there's a good person in there.
[03:29:19.640 --> 03:29:20.560]   - Yeah.
[03:29:20.560 --> 03:29:22.800]   If Milarski hadn't responded,
[03:29:22.800 --> 03:29:24.880]   if I hadn't had my sister, my wife,
[03:29:24.880 --> 03:29:27.560]   these companies that initially gave me that chance,
[03:29:27.560 --> 03:29:30.020]   my ass would be back in prison for 20 years.
[03:29:30.020 --> 03:29:32.880]   I have no doubt about that at all, all right?
[03:29:32.880 --> 03:29:34.800]   So you have to realize that.
[03:29:34.800 --> 03:29:38.640]   Cyber crime, a lot of companies that I talk to,
[03:29:38.640 --> 03:29:40.760]   they don't really understand or appreciate
[03:29:40.760 --> 03:29:45.840]   that networking aspect, that trust aspect
[03:29:45.840 --> 03:29:48.260]   of how criminals establish trust with each other,
[03:29:48.260 --> 03:29:49.420]   how they work together.
[03:29:49.420 --> 03:29:52.220]   A lot of companies think that it's a single player
[03:29:52.220 --> 03:29:53.500]   that's out victimizing them.
[03:29:53.500 --> 03:29:56.260]   And when you really break down how cyber crime operates,
[03:29:56.260 --> 03:29:58.500]   that you've got a group of individuals
[03:29:58.500 --> 03:30:00.200]   that are working together to hit you,
[03:30:00.200 --> 03:30:01.040]   but not only hit you,
[03:30:01.040 --> 03:30:04.020]   but they share and exchange information freely.
[03:30:04.020 --> 03:30:05.180]   Companies don't do that.
[03:30:05.180 --> 03:30:06.340]   You've got privacy concerns,
[03:30:06.340 --> 03:30:08.360]   you've got competitive edge concerns, everything else.
[03:30:08.360 --> 03:30:10.780]   Companies don't share information across the board
[03:30:10.780 --> 03:30:11.940]   like criminals do.
[03:30:11.940 --> 03:30:12.960]   Criminals do that.
[03:30:12.960 --> 03:30:14.980]   You have to appreciate that.
[03:30:14.980 --> 03:30:17.940]   You have to understand that big statistic
[03:30:17.940 --> 03:30:20.460]   that 90% of your attacks use known exploits.
[03:30:20.460 --> 03:30:21.820]   It's not the stuff we don't know about,
[03:30:21.820 --> 03:30:23.600]   it's the shit we do know about.
[03:30:23.600 --> 03:30:25.060]   We're not doing anything about.
[03:30:25.060 --> 03:30:27.100]   - So the way to defend against cyber crime
[03:30:27.100 --> 03:30:29.500]   is like there's a lot of low-hanging fruit
[03:30:29.500 --> 03:30:30.340]   that you should fix.
[03:30:30.340 --> 03:30:31.940]   - A lot of that, a lot of that.
[03:30:31.940 --> 03:30:34.420]   - So a lot of basic stuff that's already vulnerabilities,
[03:30:34.420 --> 03:30:35.860]   update the system security.
[03:30:35.860 --> 03:30:38.500]   - Now that doesn't take care of SolarWinds
[03:30:38.500 --> 03:30:41.660]   or CNAP or anything like that, it doesn't.
[03:30:41.660 --> 03:30:44.580]   But those instances, I mean, okay,
[03:30:44.580 --> 03:30:45.740]   that's a big instance.
[03:30:45.740 --> 03:30:46.580]   (Lex laughing)
[03:30:46.580 --> 03:30:47.420]   I mean, it is.
[03:30:47.420 --> 03:30:52.160]   - But in the full spectrum of, especially in the future,
[03:30:52.160 --> 03:30:56.420]   because there's more and more companies
[03:30:56.420 --> 03:30:58.900]   that are coming online, becoming digital,
[03:30:58.900 --> 03:31:01.460]   and it's just more and more and more,
[03:31:01.460 --> 03:31:03.740]   and those vulnerabilities in terms of human nature,
[03:31:03.740 --> 03:31:07.700]   so for social engineering and the actual outdated systems,
[03:31:07.700 --> 03:31:08.540]   all of it.
[03:31:08.540 --> 03:31:10.540]   And some of it, I guess, is,
[03:31:10.540 --> 03:31:12.060]   I mean, you're exceptionally good at this,
[03:31:12.060 --> 03:31:14.500]   is educating on the social engineering side.
[03:31:14.500 --> 03:31:16.460]   Is educating people in companies that--
[03:31:16.460 --> 03:31:18.140]   - You've got to do that.
[03:31:18.140 --> 03:31:19.580]   And companies have to, you know,
[03:31:19.580 --> 03:31:23.340]   I made that point that they never report to law enforcement.
[03:31:23.340 --> 03:31:25.140]   That's companies and individuals.
[03:31:25.140 --> 03:31:27.540]   You know, I've worked with Fortune 50 companies
[03:31:27.540 --> 03:31:30.940]   that will not press charges.
[03:31:30.940 --> 03:31:34.420]   Instead, they'll have that insider or that criminal
[03:31:34.420 --> 03:31:36.820]   sign an NDA, they'll pay 'em off,
[03:31:36.820 --> 03:31:39.420]   and we won't mention this shit anymore.
[03:31:39.420 --> 03:31:42.220]   You have to press charges, you have to report,
[03:31:42.220 --> 03:31:45.580]   you have to raise the awareness of everyone in the group.
[03:31:45.580 --> 03:31:47.780]   You have to be, it's that idea,
[03:31:47.780 --> 03:31:49.020]   and I've talked about that before,
[03:31:49.020 --> 03:31:52.740]   of understanding your place in that cybercrime spectrum.
[03:31:52.740 --> 03:31:54.660]   The way a criminal will victimize you
[03:31:54.660 --> 03:31:57.340]   depends on who you are and what you do,
[03:31:57.340 --> 03:31:59.800]   as a person and as a business.
[03:31:59.800 --> 03:32:00.900]   So you have to understand that,
[03:32:00.900 --> 03:32:02.220]   design security around that.
[03:32:02.220 --> 03:32:05.220]   You know, we've got 7,500 security companies out there.
[03:32:05.220 --> 03:32:07.620]   A whole lot of 'em are snake oil salesmen.
[03:32:07.620 --> 03:32:08.780]   A lot of 'em is gonna tell you
[03:32:08.780 --> 03:32:10.820]   that we're the one-stop solution,
[03:32:10.820 --> 03:32:13.340]   but you're not, you're not.
[03:32:13.340 --> 03:32:15.220]   You're a tool, all right?
[03:32:15.220 --> 03:32:17.300]   And you may have a very good tool,
[03:32:17.300 --> 03:32:19.860]   but it's not the only tool that's needed
[03:32:19.860 --> 03:32:22.340]   to protect against the attacks that are out there.
[03:32:22.340 --> 03:32:23.980]   And we have to be open and honest
[03:32:23.980 --> 03:32:25.500]   about that kind of stuff, if we're not.
[03:32:25.500 --> 03:32:29.740]   - So I guess defending defense is not just like one tool.
[03:32:29.740 --> 03:32:33.340]   It's a process of just like a diversity
[03:32:33.340 --> 03:32:36.020]   and just constantly educating people.
[03:32:36.020 --> 03:32:36.860]   - Absolutely.
[03:32:36.860 --> 03:32:38.340]   - So it's the social side.
[03:32:38.380 --> 03:32:40.860]   It's constantly, 'cause there's so many
[03:32:40.860 --> 03:32:43.380]   probably attack vectors in terms of the software
[03:32:43.380 --> 03:32:44.220]   that you have.
[03:32:44.220 --> 03:32:45.860]   - If you look at it, that attack surface,
[03:32:45.860 --> 03:32:47.420]   you can't plug everything.
[03:32:47.420 --> 03:32:50.140]   It's too damn large to plug everything.
[03:32:50.140 --> 03:32:52.260]   But you can do the best job you can possibly do.
[03:32:52.260 --> 03:32:55.740]   But it takes a variety of tools to do that, all right?
[03:32:55.740 --> 03:32:59.180]   The idea, and Arcos is big about that,
[03:32:59.180 --> 03:33:04.060]   but the idea is to take the cost of fraud
[03:33:04.060 --> 03:33:06.020]   to the fraudster so high
[03:33:06.020 --> 03:33:08.580]   that they basically try to pick another target, all right?
[03:33:08.580 --> 03:33:09.780]   And that's the idea that you want.
[03:33:09.780 --> 03:33:12.900]   You want it to be not worth the criminal's time
[03:33:12.900 --> 03:33:14.780]   to hit your company.
[03:33:14.780 --> 03:33:16.860]   - What about white hat hacking?
[03:33:16.860 --> 03:33:20.580]   So like, you know, hacking for good,
[03:33:20.580 --> 03:33:24.820]   sort of testing systems and then giving companies
[03:33:24.820 --> 03:33:27.060]   the vulnerabilities as you find them.
[03:33:27.060 --> 03:33:28.300]   - I think it's outstanding.
[03:33:28.300 --> 03:33:29.940]   I do, I think that, I think pin testing,
[03:33:29.940 --> 03:33:31.500]   white hat stuff is outstanding.
[03:33:31.500 --> 03:33:32.420]   I truly do.
[03:33:32.420 --> 03:33:34.760]   I think that you have to.
[03:33:35.760 --> 03:33:40.760]   It has to be tempered with what is reality as well though.
[03:33:40.760 --> 03:33:42.560]   All right, you know, we've got a whole industry
[03:33:42.560 --> 03:33:45.680]   of people who try to sell RFID wallets
[03:33:45.680 --> 03:33:48.480]   that I don't know of many RFID hackers out there
[03:33:48.480 --> 03:33:50.760]   on the criminal side, to be honest with you.
[03:33:50.760 --> 03:33:51.800]   - Yeah, so some of it is just like
[03:33:51.800 --> 03:33:53.680]   a psychological safety blanket
[03:33:53.680 --> 03:33:58.240]   that's not actually providing any protection.
[03:33:58.240 --> 03:34:02.080]   By the way, you wrote on LinkedIn something about ID me.
[03:34:02.080 --> 03:34:04.520]   (laughing)
[03:34:04.520 --> 03:34:05.720]   - What is it?
[03:34:05.720 --> 03:34:07.160]   Why is it a problem?
[03:34:07.160 --> 03:34:08.760]   I was going down a rabbit hole with you.
[03:34:08.760 --> 03:34:10.800]   - I was wondering if you were gonna mention that.
[03:34:10.800 --> 03:34:14.040]   You know, they lost, I guess I was partially responsible
[03:34:14.040 --> 03:34:16.500]   for them losing an $86 million contract.
[03:34:16.500 --> 03:34:18.680]   - What was the contract with?
[03:34:18.680 --> 03:34:19.520]   - With the IRS.
[03:34:19.520 --> 03:34:21.280]   - The government, just the IRS.
[03:34:21.280 --> 03:34:22.320]   So what is it?
[03:34:22.320 --> 03:34:25.840]   - So ID me is an identity, okay, backtrack.
[03:34:25.840 --> 03:34:28.880]   ID me is a marketing company that wants to say
[03:34:28.880 --> 03:34:30.440]   they're an identity verification company.
[03:34:30.440 --> 03:34:32.400]   - I just wanna bring this up to see you get angry.
[03:34:32.400 --> 03:34:33.920]   (laughing)
[03:34:33.920 --> 03:34:36.880]   - Okay, I'll tell you what my issue is.
[03:34:36.880 --> 03:34:37.920]   My issue is--
[03:34:37.920 --> 03:34:42.240]   - So it's a company that's used for authentication
[03:34:42.240 --> 03:34:43.360]   by the IRS, I guess.
[03:34:43.360 --> 03:34:45.960]   - Well, IRS, Social Security Administration, VA,
[03:34:45.960 --> 03:34:50.680]   at one point 23 state unemployment offices,
[03:34:50.680 --> 03:34:51.840]   a few other services as well.
[03:34:51.840 --> 03:34:54.680]   - So I guess the idea is that you would be able
[03:34:54.680 --> 03:34:59.680]   to unlock your account or authenticate yourself
[03:35:00.220 --> 03:35:04.860]   as a human being by using your face or something like that,
[03:35:04.860 --> 03:35:06.700]   or private information.
[03:35:06.700 --> 03:35:08.860]   - They've got a tiered system for the verification.
[03:35:08.860 --> 03:35:13.820]   They've got a free system, which is questionable,
[03:35:13.820 --> 03:35:16.340]   where you submit an ID and it's been shown,
[03:35:16.340 --> 03:35:17.740]   several bypasses have been shown.
[03:35:17.740 --> 03:35:20.060]   And I don't wanna talk about their security horribly bad
[03:35:20.060 --> 03:35:22.860]   because I wanna be honest, there are bypasses
[03:35:22.860 --> 03:35:25.440]   for a lot of security systems out there, all right?
[03:35:26.380 --> 03:35:31.380]   The issue that I have with ID.me is that their policies
[03:35:31.380 --> 03:35:34.740]   are somewhat questionable.
[03:35:34.740 --> 03:35:36.100]   I don't care if you're a private company
[03:35:36.100 --> 03:35:37.500]   that has those policies in place,
[03:35:37.500 --> 03:35:41.860]   but if you're a government agency and you as a citizen
[03:35:41.860 --> 03:35:44.500]   are entitled to a benefit or a service
[03:35:44.500 --> 03:35:46.660]   of that government agency,
[03:35:46.660 --> 03:35:49.380]   and then the government agency forces you
[03:35:49.380 --> 03:35:52.380]   to give up your complete identity profile
[03:35:52.380 --> 03:35:53.460]   to a private company.
[03:35:53.460 --> 03:35:55.460]   And then that private company uses that profile
[03:35:55.460 --> 03:35:59.420]   for marketing purposes to further profit, things like that.
[03:35:59.420 --> 03:36:01.740]   I have a huge issue with that.
[03:36:01.740 --> 03:36:03.840]   I don't care if you're a private company that does that,
[03:36:03.840 --> 03:36:05.800]   I just don't think that citizens need to be forced
[03:36:05.800 --> 03:36:08.340]   into doing that in order to get a benefit or service
[03:36:08.340 --> 03:36:09.940]   that they're entitled to.
[03:36:09.940 --> 03:36:11.740]   So that's my big issue.
[03:36:11.740 --> 03:36:14.820]   - So that, I mean, given how much value,
[03:36:14.820 --> 03:36:17.460]   how much we talked about the value of identity,
[03:36:17.460 --> 03:36:19.740]   you don't think that should be handed over lightly?
[03:36:19.740 --> 03:36:21.580]   - No, absolutely not.
[03:36:21.580 --> 03:36:23.020]   And who would have thought that Brett Johnson
[03:36:23.020 --> 03:36:24.900]   would ever become a privacy advocate?
[03:36:24.900 --> 03:36:26.580]   (both laughing)
[03:36:26.580 --> 03:36:29.060]   But here I am.
[03:36:29.060 --> 03:36:33.260]   I mean, it's just, people don't understand
[03:36:33.260 --> 03:36:37.940]   or appreciate the value of who they are.
[03:36:37.940 --> 03:36:41.340]   And certainly you've got a host of companies,
[03:36:41.340 --> 03:36:42.380]   ID means not the only one,
[03:36:42.380 --> 03:36:44.100]   but you've got some of these companies that say,
[03:36:44.100 --> 03:36:48.160]   well, we strip out the PII of the individual.
[03:36:48.160 --> 03:36:49.420]   We're just using the biometrics
[03:36:49.420 --> 03:36:51.600]   and the sites they're visiting and things like that.
[03:36:51.600 --> 03:36:53.180]   That's identity.
[03:36:53.180 --> 03:36:55.660]   You can still ping that one unique individual
[03:36:55.660 --> 03:36:58.740]   out of all, using that information, stripping out the PII,
[03:36:58.740 --> 03:37:00.940]   you can still ping who that individual is.
[03:37:00.940 --> 03:37:05.060]   - So having lived a life of crime for many years,
[03:37:05.060 --> 03:37:08.260]   I'm sure you've connected indirectly
[03:37:08.260 --> 03:37:11.580]   to a large number of very dangerous people.
[03:37:11.580 --> 03:37:12.780]   - Indirectly, indirectly.
[03:37:12.780 --> 03:37:14.220]   - Yeah. (both laughing)
[03:37:14.220 --> 03:37:17.700]   But the network indirectly is even larger, right?
[03:37:17.700 --> 03:37:18.580]   - Oh yeah, oh yeah.
[03:37:18.580 --> 03:37:21.000]   - Are you, and I apologize for this question,
[03:37:22.860 --> 03:37:27.020]   are you ever worried for your life, for your wellbeing?
[03:37:27.020 --> 03:37:30.340]   Like having seen a world that's really dangerous
[03:37:30.340 --> 03:37:35.100]   in ways that's not, that operates in the shadows?
[03:37:35.100 --> 03:37:41.140]   - You know, like I said, when we started Shadow Crew
[03:37:41.140 --> 03:37:44.320]   and started that initial cyber crime business, that world,
[03:37:44.320 --> 03:37:47.780]   violence wasn't there.
[03:37:47.780 --> 03:37:48.980]   It came in later.
[03:37:48.980 --> 03:37:51.540]   Now violence is inherent in the system.
[03:37:51.540 --> 03:37:54.460]   I'm doing Monty Python, but it's part of it.
[03:37:54.460 --> 03:37:58.820]   - Yeah, the mob, the mafia are now part of this whole thing.
[03:37:58.820 --> 03:38:00.020]   - Cartels are part of it.
[03:38:00.020 --> 03:38:00.860]   - Yeah.
[03:38:00.860 --> 03:38:03.780]   - Drugs are inherently intertwined
[03:38:03.780 --> 03:38:06.460]   in cyber crime marketplaces because of the profit potential.
[03:38:06.460 --> 03:38:08.820]   And with that comes a lot of violence as well.
[03:38:08.820 --> 03:38:12.100]   - Yeah, the cartels already brought the violence
[03:38:12.100 --> 03:38:14.100]   that they're good at from the 20th century.
[03:38:14.100 --> 03:38:14.940]   - Absolutely, absolutely.
[03:38:14.940 --> 03:38:16.660]   - Into the technology of the 21st century.
[03:38:16.660 --> 03:38:20.140]   - Now, do I worry about that?
[03:38:20.140 --> 03:38:24.260]   It's interesting that my family worries about that.
[03:38:24.260 --> 03:38:28.460]   All right, I think I may be just too involved in it
[03:38:28.460 --> 03:38:32.300]   to appreciate that type of danger,
[03:38:32.300 --> 03:38:36.020]   but my family worries about that, they do.
[03:38:36.020 --> 03:38:37.520]   Do I think it's a possibility?
[03:38:37.520 --> 03:38:41.200]   I'm the guy that says what needs to be said.
[03:38:41.200 --> 03:38:45.300]   I've made, I've built my trust in this industry
[03:38:45.300 --> 03:38:49.860]   by not being scared of calling out companies
[03:38:49.860 --> 03:38:53.740]   and individuals and not being scared of targeting criminals
[03:38:53.740 --> 03:38:54.820]   or criminal groups.
[03:38:54.820 --> 03:38:59.820]   - Your honesty as a human being emotionally
[03:38:59.820 --> 03:39:03.340]   and intellectually is really refreshing.
[03:39:03.340 --> 03:39:06.780]   It's a gift and thank you, thank you for doing that.
[03:39:06.780 --> 03:39:11.660]   Is there a device you can give to young people today
[03:39:11.660 --> 03:39:13.380]   about life?
[03:39:13.380 --> 03:39:18.380]   You broke many rules, all the rules.
[03:39:19.140 --> 03:39:21.620]   Some rules should be broken.
[03:39:21.620 --> 03:39:23.820]   So if you look at somebody young today in high school
[03:39:23.820 --> 03:39:28.820]   and college thinking how they can break the rules legally
[03:39:28.820 --> 03:39:33.020]   and live a life that's something
[03:39:33.020 --> 03:39:35.860]   they could be really proud of, what would you say?
[03:39:35.860 --> 03:39:40.860]   - Biggest lesson I've learned, you want your life
[03:39:40.860 --> 03:39:45.420]   to be one where you're helping people and not hurting people.
[03:39:45.420 --> 03:39:48.620]   And that really hit me the first time
[03:39:48.620 --> 03:39:49.900]   I walked into Quattro Co.
[03:39:49.900 --> 03:39:54.420]   You see the brightest minds in the United States
[03:39:54.420 --> 03:39:57.060]   who give up a lot of money,
[03:39:57.060 --> 03:39:58.660]   the opportunities of a lot of money
[03:39:58.660 --> 03:40:01.900]   because they believe in helping people.
[03:40:01.900 --> 03:40:03.980]   Where I spent a career just hurting
[03:40:03.980 --> 03:40:07.860]   and harming individuals, that's a hell of a lesson.
[03:40:07.860 --> 03:40:11.100]   And I'm glad I'm there, but I would tell people out there,
[03:40:11.100 --> 03:40:14.540]   it's fine to want money, it's fine to do that,
[03:40:14.540 --> 03:40:18.240]   it's fine to test systems, it's fine to circumvent the rules
[03:40:18.240 --> 03:40:20.220]   if you're not breaking the law, it's fine to do all that.
[03:40:20.220 --> 03:40:22.020]   I like doing that, all right?
[03:40:22.020 --> 03:40:23.580]   But if you've got the mindset,
[03:40:23.580 --> 03:40:26.540]   if you can just adhere to the mindset of helping people
[03:40:26.540 --> 03:40:29.220]   and not hurting people, I think you'll be all right
[03:40:29.220 --> 03:40:31.220]   at the end of the day.
[03:40:31.220 --> 03:40:35.140]   - What gives you, again, given the dark web,
[03:40:35.140 --> 03:40:37.300]   given all the dangers out there,
[03:40:37.300 --> 03:40:39.860]   what gives you hope about the future?
[03:40:39.860 --> 03:40:43.100]   Looking into five, 10 years, 50 years,
[03:40:43.100 --> 03:40:45.500]   I mean, hope for human civilization.
[03:40:45.500 --> 03:40:50.500]   If we do all right, if we make it out of this century,
[03:40:50.500 --> 03:40:55.560]   what do you think would be the reason?
[03:40:55.560 --> 03:40:59.160]   - What would be, that's a damn good question.
[03:40:59.160 --> 03:41:01.360]   'Cause I mean, we got a lot of bad stuff going on.
[03:41:01.360 --> 03:41:03.300]   - We got a lot of reasons.
[03:41:03.300 --> 03:41:05.700]   If I asked you the other question
[03:41:05.700 --> 03:41:08.280]   of how do you think human civilization will destroy itself,
[03:41:08.280 --> 03:41:10.680]   I'm sure you have a lot of answers.
[03:41:10.680 --> 03:41:12.520]   - You know, what gives me hope is
[03:41:14.680 --> 03:41:16.920]   you see people working together.
[03:41:16.920 --> 03:41:19.160]   The COVID's have been a little bit different
[03:41:19.160 --> 03:41:20.480]   because I think too many people
[03:41:20.480 --> 03:41:22.200]   wanted to play politics with it.
[03:41:22.200 --> 03:41:23.960]   - That's been the heartbreaking thing about COVID
[03:41:23.960 --> 03:41:26.880]   is it's in many ways pulled people apart.
[03:41:26.880 --> 03:41:29.760]   I mean, because a virus involves
[03:41:29.760 --> 03:41:34.660]   being afraid of each other because,
[03:41:34.660 --> 03:41:35.760]   I mean, that was a scary thing.
[03:41:35.760 --> 03:41:38.220]   People talk about pandemics in that way,
[03:41:38.220 --> 03:41:40.100]   that you're afraid of other humans.
[03:41:40.100 --> 03:41:41.620]   That is the most terrifying thing.
[03:41:41.620 --> 03:41:44.440]   It's not the destructive nature of what it does to your body.
[03:41:44.440 --> 03:41:46.720]   It's just that it pulls people apart.
[03:41:46.720 --> 03:41:49.240]   And then you realize how fundamental
[03:41:49.240 --> 03:41:51.240]   that human connection is to human civilization.
[03:41:51.240 --> 03:41:53.040]   - Absolutely, absolutely.
[03:41:53.040 --> 03:41:56.380]   But you know, we, as human beings, we do,
[03:41:56.380 --> 03:41:59.400]   when things really get bad,
[03:41:59.400 --> 03:42:00.460]   when things really get bad,
[03:42:00.460 --> 03:42:03.640]   we do tend to respond and group together.
[03:42:03.640 --> 03:42:04.560]   We do that.
[03:42:04.560 --> 03:42:09.560]   - When there's injustice, we see it, we rise up.
[03:42:09.560 --> 03:42:14.280]   - I wake up every morning and I watch Fox News
[03:42:14.280 --> 03:42:18.120]   and CNN so I can be pissed off at everyone.
[03:42:18.120 --> 03:42:18.960]   - All right.
[03:42:18.960 --> 03:42:19.780]   (laughing)
[03:42:19.780 --> 03:42:22.640]   The division, the outrage, they're really feeding,
[03:42:22.640 --> 03:42:25.120]   they want you, they want you to be angry.
[03:42:25.120 --> 03:42:27.880]   - Yeah, that's what causes me despair
[03:42:27.880 --> 03:42:29.840]   and what I think that we just need to,
[03:42:29.840 --> 03:42:32.640]   Elizabeth was very good.
[03:42:32.640 --> 03:42:34.000]   She taught me one hell of a lesson
[03:42:34.000 --> 03:42:37.440]   because before I met her, I was a news hound.
[03:42:37.440 --> 03:42:40.120]   News would be on all the time, a couple of channels of it.
[03:42:40.120 --> 03:42:44.160]   And she was the woman who didn't watch the news.
[03:42:44.160 --> 03:42:45.600]   At all.
[03:42:45.600 --> 03:42:48.320]   And I didn't understand that back then, man.
[03:42:48.320 --> 03:42:49.520]   But now I do.
[03:42:49.520 --> 03:42:52.480]   You know, now I'm like, pretty smart, you know?
[03:42:52.480 --> 03:42:53.600]   (laughing)
[03:42:53.600 --> 03:42:55.560]   Don't need to listen to that bullshit as it is.
[03:42:55.560 --> 03:42:58.160]   - That's why I love reading history books.
[03:42:58.160 --> 03:43:03.920]   I just, I feel like that's the right perspective
[03:43:03.920 --> 03:43:05.600]   I take on modern times.
[03:43:05.600 --> 03:43:07.600]   You know, how will this time be written about
[03:43:07.600 --> 03:43:08.840]   in the history books?
[03:43:08.840 --> 03:43:10.440]   And react to that.
[03:43:10.440 --> 03:43:15.440]   Don't the daily ups and downs of the outrages,
[03:43:15.440 --> 03:43:17.280]   which is getting worse and worse
[03:43:17.280 --> 03:43:19.440]   in terms of how quick the turnaround is
[03:43:19.440 --> 03:43:20.800]   in terms of the news.
[03:43:20.800 --> 03:43:22.920]   - I'll tell you what, I'm sitting here,
[03:43:22.920 --> 03:43:24.840]   I appreciate you talking to me.
[03:43:24.840 --> 03:43:25.680]   I do.
[03:43:25.680 --> 03:43:28.440]   Because, you know, I'm talking about that relationship
[03:43:28.440 --> 03:43:29.280]   and everything.
[03:43:29.280 --> 03:43:32.080]   It's really been this kind of realization
[03:43:32.080 --> 03:43:33.000]   for me on a lot of things.
[03:43:33.000 --> 03:43:34.960]   So I really appreciate you asking those questions
[03:43:34.960 --> 03:43:36.720]   and everything, me being able to talk about that.
[03:43:36.720 --> 03:43:41.720]   - I love it that you value, first of all,
[03:43:41.720 --> 03:43:43.720]   you're self-aware how important love
[03:43:43.720 --> 03:43:45.240]   is in a human being's life.
[03:43:45.240 --> 03:43:46.640]   (laughing)
[03:43:46.640 --> 03:43:48.200]   It can make you do some of the best
[03:43:48.200 --> 03:43:50.240]   and some of the worst things in this world.
[03:43:50.240 --> 03:43:51.640]   And it's good to think about that.
[03:43:51.640 --> 03:43:52.880]   It's good to think about that.
[03:43:52.880 --> 03:43:55.280]   That is what makes us human, is that connection
[03:43:55.280 --> 03:43:56.720]   and that love for each other.
[03:43:56.720 --> 03:44:01.840]   What do you think is the meaning of life?
[03:44:01.840 --> 03:44:03.200]   This big, ridiculous question.
[03:44:03.200 --> 03:44:05.240]   Why the hell, what are we all here for?
[03:44:05.240 --> 03:44:06.520]   - I don't think it is ridiculous, man.
[03:44:06.520 --> 03:44:09.760]   I, to me, that meaning of life is finding out
[03:44:09.760 --> 03:44:13.440]   that lesson, that we need to help each other.
[03:44:13.440 --> 03:44:15.160]   If you talk, you ask about security,
[03:44:15.160 --> 03:44:16.000]   how do you get to say that?
[03:44:16.000 --> 03:44:18.560]   But, you know, everybody's worried about themselves.
[03:44:18.560 --> 03:44:21.840]   The way you solve that security problem
[03:44:21.840 --> 03:44:26.440]   is it takes everybody looking out for everyone else.
[03:44:26.440 --> 03:44:29.480]   That's how you solve that problem.
[03:44:29.480 --> 03:44:32.400]   - And however you take, whatever journey you take
[03:44:32.400 --> 03:44:34.000]   to discovering that point.
[03:44:34.000 --> 03:44:34.840]   - Yeah.
[03:44:34.840 --> 03:44:37.720]   I mean, with me, I've been asked a few times,
[03:44:37.720 --> 03:44:40.040]   do you regret anything, would you change anything?
[03:44:40.040 --> 03:44:45.040]   I've done a shitload of despicable things in my life.
[03:44:45.040 --> 03:44:50.280]   But I'm at a point in my life where I like who I am.
[03:44:50.280 --> 03:44:52.520]   And I know that I am doing exactly what I'm supposed
[03:44:52.520 --> 03:44:53.720]   to be doing with my life.
[03:44:53.720 --> 03:44:55.640]   So, would I change anything?
[03:44:55.640 --> 03:44:59.480]   As bad as a lot of that shit has been, I wouldn't.
[03:44:59.480 --> 03:45:00.920]   - It made you who you are.
[03:45:00.920 --> 03:45:02.000]   - Yeah.
[03:45:02.000 --> 03:45:03.320]   - The whole of it, the whole mess.
[03:45:03.320 --> 03:45:05.640]   - I've tried to say that, but it's true.
[03:45:05.640 --> 03:45:07.440]   That's the weird thing, it's true.
[03:45:07.440 --> 03:45:08.280]   - Yeah.
[03:45:08.280 --> 03:45:09.120]   - So.
[03:45:09.120 --> 03:45:09.940]   - Yeah.
[03:45:09.940 --> 03:45:12.200]   Also, you mentioned that you're thinking
[03:45:12.200 --> 03:45:13.600]   of launching a show.
[03:45:13.600 --> 03:45:14.520]   What's it gonna be called?
[03:45:14.520 --> 03:45:16.440]   'Cause you've done a couple of podcasts.
[03:45:16.440 --> 03:45:17.640]   You're incredibly good at this.
[03:45:17.640 --> 03:45:18.720]   You're so good at this.
[03:45:18.720 --> 03:45:19.760]   - I've done a couple.
[03:45:19.760 --> 03:45:22.440]   I'm on a lot of podcasts and everything like that.
[03:45:22.440 --> 03:45:25.880]   I had the "Fraudcast" with a friend of mine,
[03:45:25.880 --> 03:45:26.720]   Carice Hendrick.
[03:45:26.720 --> 03:45:29.120]   And that ended because of a difference of opinion.
[03:45:29.120 --> 03:45:31.040]   (laughing)
[03:45:31.040 --> 03:45:34.360]   Depending on who you ask, one of us was an asshole.
[03:45:34.360 --> 03:45:35.200]   - Yes.
[03:45:35.200 --> 03:45:36.040]   - And it may have been me.
[03:45:36.040 --> 03:45:36.860]   - Yeah.
[03:45:36.860 --> 03:45:38.560]   - But then I did the "Anglerfish Podcast,"
[03:45:38.560 --> 03:45:40.200]   which that was, I gotta be honest with you, Lex,
[03:45:40.200 --> 03:45:41.960]   it was completely directionless.
[03:45:41.960 --> 03:45:44.040]   And it was Brett Johnson getting lazy.
[03:45:44.040 --> 03:45:45.060]   - Yeah.
[03:45:45.060 --> 03:45:46.880]   - So I ended that.
[03:45:46.880 --> 03:45:50.120]   The Brett Johnson Show is launching--
[03:45:50.120 --> 03:45:50.960]   - That's the new one.
[03:45:50.960 --> 03:45:51.780]   - That's the new one.
[03:45:51.780 --> 03:45:52.620]   - That's what the new one's called.
[03:45:52.620 --> 03:45:53.880]   - And, you know, I--
[03:45:53.880 --> 03:45:55.580]   - What are you thinking of doing with it?
[03:45:55.580 --> 03:45:58.400]   - Making a difference, for one thing.
[03:45:58.400 --> 03:46:01.000]   But it's gonna be talking about cybercrime security,
[03:46:01.000 --> 03:46:01.840]   helping people.
[03:46:01.840 --> 03:46:04.000]   - Interviews, solo.
[03:46:04.000 --> 03:46:06.520]   - Interviews, a lot of it's gonna be solo.
[03:46:06.520 --> 03:46:08.120]   Now I'm calling it the Brett Johnson Show,
[03:46:08.120 --> 03:46:10.280]   I mean, because it's gonna handle crime,
[03:46:10.280 --> 03:46:12.040]   talk to criminals and how they turn their lives
[03:46:12.040 --> 03:46:13.400]   around to a degree as well.
[03:46:13.400 --> 03:46:15.280]   But there's some shit I wanna bitch about too.
[03:46:15.280 --> 03:46:16.120]   - Yeah.
[03:46:16.120 --> 03:46:16.940]   - So figure it till the end.
[03:46:16.940 --> 03:46:17.780]   - I can tell you're good at this.
[03:46:17.780 --> 03:46:18.620]   I'm a fan already.
[03:46:18.620 --> 03:46:19.440]   (laughing)
[03:46:19.440 --> 03:46:20.280]   I'm gonna listen, I'm gonna subscribe.
[03:46:20.280 --> 03:46:21.120]   You should too.
[03:46:21.120 --> 03:46:22.600]   You're launching it soon.
[03:46:22.600 --> 03:46:23.740]   - Soon, next week.
[03:46:23.740 --> 03:46:26.400]   - Brett, you're an incredible human being.
[03:46:26.400 --> 03:46:31.400]   The honesty, the love, I could just see
[03:46:31.400 --> 03:46:33.280]   how much of yourself you put out there.
[03:46:33.280 --> 03:46:36.480]   One of the best public speakers I've ever heard.
[03:46:36.480 --> 03:46:38.400]   Definitely you should be in a Scorsese film
[03:46:38.400 --> 03:46:39.660]   about cybercrime.
[03:46:39.660 --> 03:46:43.840]   100%, I can tell you're a good actor.
[03:46:43.840 --> 03:46:45.400]   It makes perfect sense.
[03:46:45.400 --> 03:46:48.160]   Anyway, I'm deeply honored that you spent your time
[03:46:48.160 --> 03:46:49.000]   with me today.
[03:46:49.000 --> 03:46:49.840]   - I am too, thank you.
[03:46:49.840 --> 03:46:51.440]   - It was amazing.
[03:46:51.440 --> 03:46:52.880]   Thanks for listening to this conversation
[03:46:52.880 --> 03:46:53.960]   with Brett Johnson.

[03:46:59.600 --> 03:47:03.620]   from George R.R. Martin, from "A Clash of Kings".
[03:47:03.620 --> 03:47:07.640]   "A good act does not wash out the bad,
[03:47:07.640 --> 03:47:10.200]   "nor a bad act the good.
[03:47:10.200 --> 03:47:12.380]   "Each should have its own reward."
