[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   The beautiful thing we're learning is that after over 10 million biomarkers,
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.440]   we're seeing these incredible patterns.
[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.360]   One obviously of poor metabolic health.
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:08.800]   And this is a health-forward population.
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.520]   So we're seeing over 90% have abnormal lipid tests.
[00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.600]   96% have small LDL, which is not tested on a regular cholesterol test,
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.600]   which is the more risky cholesterol particle.
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.920]   We're seeing over 50% have IAPOB,
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.400]   which is probably the most important cholesterol test
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.840]   that your doctor doesn't test.
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.440]   You're typically 50%.
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.080]   We're seeing over 40% have levels of inflammation.
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.640]   67% have nutritional deficiencies
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.040]   and things that really make a difference in how you feel,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.680]   like mental health and energy and immunity,
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.560]   like vitamin D and iron and the B vitamins,
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.160]   like B12 folate and B6.
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.480]   And it's kind of shocking, but America is just sick.
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.760]   So all of us are struggling.
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.200]   And I think people just don't know how deficient they are in things.
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.480]   So I had a woman the other day,
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.680]   it was like she was a young, healthy woman,
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.640]   but she was always getting sick.
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.520]   And her vitamin D level is 26, which is very, very low.
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.000]   So I think these are simple things you can find out about,
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.400]   easy to fix and tune up and optimize your health with.
