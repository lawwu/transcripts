[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Summer has arrived and with it, renewed questions about modesty in the inbox.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   So, Pastor John, can you speak to the issue of modesty regarding clothing at the pool,
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   especially bikinis, and speak to pastors and leaders?
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   Should they take time in the spring to directly address the topic of modesty?
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   And if so, how would you counsel such a brave pastor to best step through that minefield?
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   Here's the most important thing to say.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   It is impossible to come into a church or a youth ministry or a school, say a Christian school,
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   that is permeated with immodesty, immodesty, and fix it with rules about modesty.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   There is a place for rules, guidelines in families, in schools, in youth ministries, in churches.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   But if you try to turn that thing around, that institution, whatever,
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   if you try to turn that around by starting with the rules or the guidelines,
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   it will not accomplish a Christ-exalting, gospel-rooted, spirit-empowered, faith-sustained,
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   Bible-informed, joyful, free culture of modesty. It won't.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   And yet that's the goal.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   So, my approach was never to start with the rules or the guidelines,
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   but to start with God and the gospel and the Bible and the spirit and faith and joy.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Deep things need to happen in a woman's and a man's soul
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   before they have any chance of thinking and feeling about these things in a way that honors God.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Until God has become your treasure, so I'll just say this to any woman, any man who dresses inappropriately,
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   until God has become your treasure, until your own sin has become the thing you hate most,
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   until the Word of God is your supreme authority, that you feel to be more precious than gold, sweeter than honey,
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   until the gospel of Christ's death in your place is the most precious news in the world to you,
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   until you have learned to deny yourself short-term pleasures for the sake of long-term joy and holiness,
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   until you have grown to love the Holy Spirit and long for His fruit more than man's praise,
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   until you count everything as loss compared to the supreme value of knowing Christ,
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   your attitude towards your clothing and your appearance will be controlled by forces that don't honor Christ.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   So, every pastor can see we've got work to do. I mean, deep, soul work to do,
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   which means for a pastor that 99% of his effort will be the establishment in the heart of these glorious supernatural works of God.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   He will preach and teach and worship and model in himself and in his family how the gospel changes everything.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   And he will realize that apart from the work of the Holy Spirit, through the Word and through faith,
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   his church will be split between two kinds of carnal people.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   One group will bristle at every mention of modesty and say, "How dare you tell me or my children how to dress?"
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   That's a bad attitude and it's carnal. But the other group will put all their emphasis on outward appearance
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   with little sense of the heart and that it's supremely important. And these two groups can never know peace.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   They both have failed. They're not deeply transformed by the gospel.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   So, my counsel is teach your people these things year in and year out.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   Expose the pride of licentiousness and self-will and expose the pride of externalism and formalism that has no heart in it.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   It doesn't see the gospel as precious. You preach and you pray for a gospel culture where men and women have
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   and I've got a little list here that really, once you hear it, you know it's going to change the way people dress.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   Whether it's in the swimming pool or in church. A sweet submission to Christ. A saturation with the Word of God.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   A humble attentiveness to the wisdom of others and a desire to grow and learn.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   A deep suspicion of the power of worldliness to control our habits and a loving consideration of others when we choose what we wear.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   And when the time is right, so here I'm trying to get more specific. When the time is right, yes, you take up the texts like 1 Timothy 2.8.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   I desire that men in every place should pray lifting holy hands without anger and quarreling and likewise that women should adorn themselves in respectable apparel with modesty and self-control.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   And you work through it, making sure that everyone feels that the Bible really does care about how we dress.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   And it really does want us to dress in a way that's rooted in humble, joyful, Christ-exalting, other-serving gospel faith.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   Here's three closing practical tips from my experience.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   Number one, when it comes to guidelines that grow out of the gospel, start with your staff and the leaders of the ministries that are up front.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   Don't start with everybody. Start working from the inside out so that there emerges a culture and a modeling from your worship leaders, from your staff who are in front, and from the leaders of the youth ministry and so on.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   Work with your leaders. Number two, deal with parents quietly and work toward common expectations for the young people.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   It's not easy, but it is a wise priority instead of attacking things at the most painful point of the way the girls or boys are dressing.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   It's come on, let's get the parents on board here.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   And number three, cultivate the joyful sense that modesty is beautiful.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:31.720]   Renounce, renounce any mindset that "modest" means "frumpy."
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:35.880]   From my own experience – I'm just testifying as a man now who's been a teenager, and a
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:41.280]   20-year-old, and a 30-year-old, and a 40-year-old, and a 50-year-old, and a 60-year-old – I
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:53.120]   can testify without any doubt that at every age of my life, my masculine life, sexy dressing
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:58.400]   of women is less attractive than modest beauty.
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.440]   Of course it makes the eyes turn.
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.680]   It makes the eyes turn.
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:10.840]   But there is a world of difference between making men's eyes turn with sexy dressing
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:16.000]   and being attractive as a beautiful or a handsome person.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.640]   That's an excellent and timely word.
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:19.960]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:23.920]   And this is the season for modesty discussions, and it's the season for vacations.
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:27.560]   And tomorrow I'll ask Pastor John to share a little theology of summer vacations and
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:31.980]   rest and why it's an important component in our lives.
[00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:35.080]   For more about this podcast, find us online at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:40.400]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke, and we will see you tomorrow.
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:41.760]   See you tomorrow.
