[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.800]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.560]   of the "Everyday Educator" podcast.
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.360]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.600]   and I'm excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.960]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.040]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.320]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.680]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.080]   this homeschooling possibility
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.400]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.240]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.480]   But don't forget,
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.040]   although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.040]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.680]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.820]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.160]   Well, listeners, I'm excited to talk to you today
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.400]   about this question that people have asked me for years
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.400]   and that I asked myself all those many years ago
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.320]   when I started homeschooling.
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.320]   How do I know that I started already?
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.640]   It's all about the beginning homeschool journey.
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.400]   I have met so many young moms and dads
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.400]   who are very interested in this whole notion
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.840]   of home-centered education.
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.680]   They are so mesmerized by the idea
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.680]   that their family could grow closer together every day
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.840]   for all the years that their children will spend at home
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.840]   and that they could actually learn together as a family.
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:00.040]   But I have lots of these preschool homeschooling-minded moms
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.320]   who say, "I don't really know when I'm supposed
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.560]   "to start this and I don't know
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.200]   "what it's supposed to look like.
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.460]   "And did I already start?
[00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.960]   "And did I do it right?
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.880]   "And am I doing it right?"
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.760]   And you know, as parents, we have a lot of angst
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.480]   and we have a lot of anxiety and we have a lot of fear.
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.480]   But I cajoled a good friend of mine
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.240]   into coming on today to talk to me about this.
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.240]   And I'm hoping that in the course of our conversation
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.040]   and our remembrances and our words of wisdom
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.600]   that we wish somebody had posed to us all those years ago,
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.920]   that you, moms and dads, will get some encouragement,
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.760]   will get a little inspiration,
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.200]   and maybe even some new ideas.
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.040]   So I want you to welcome my good friend, Amy Jones.
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.840]   She is joining me on this journey today.
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.680]   Amy, thanks for coming.
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.600]   - Oh, thank you.
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.600]   This is, again, a delightful way of remembering.
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.760]   And you know, Lisa, as I was thinking
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.440]   about what you were just saying,
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:17.200]   just recognizing God's work in our life
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.400]   and how in the midst of just being really bewildered,
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.800]   I don't know if you ever felt that way.
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.160]   - Yes.
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.240]   - I started that way.
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.640]   I still feel that way a lot.
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.680]   That God's path, just His shepherding is remarkable.
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.160]   Looking back, isn't it always when you're looking back
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.320]   and praise His steps as He's guided you?
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.320]   So it's given me a lot of joy to be remembering
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.560]   and just of how He superintended
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.920]   when I just really didn't know what was happening.
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.080]   I could see all His work.
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.600]   It was really lovely.
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.880]   So thank you for helping me remember that.
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.320]   - It is so true, Amy,
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.320]   that it is sometimes easier to see
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.840]   the sure, steady arm of the Lord
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.440]   that was around your shoulders
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.560]   and that had a hand on your shoulder
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.600]   the whole time.
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.520]   It's easier for me to see that when I look back
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:21.560]   and I realize, wow, that whole time,
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.640]   God was walking right beside of me
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.800]   and He was helping me.
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.880]   He was helping to guide my steps.
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.200]   Every time I ask Him, He did it.
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.760]   And when I ran ahead, He was usually,
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.160]   well, He was always waiting to welcome me back
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.400]   when I stumbled back with a skinned knee
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.960]   because I had run off on my own impetuously
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.400]   in some direction that just looked promising,
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.680]   but upon exploration turned out to be the wrong path.
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:56.120]   But I love that reminder that God is here
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.240]   and He is working
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.800]   and He is drawing us to Himself.
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:06.200]   And that is the most important work
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.640]   of the Holy Spirit, to draw us to the Lord.
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:16.520]   And I think that it is the most important job
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.840]   of parenting to draw our children to the Lord,
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.680]   to introduce them to Him and show them
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.160]   that He is real and that He is strong
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.160]   and that He is loving
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.760]   and that He is joyful and merciful.
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.880]   So that's really cool.
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:42.440]   I want us to talk about those early days
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:43.880]   of homeschooling.
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.080]   Do you remember your first days of homeschooling?
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.480]   And how many kids did you have when you began?
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:53.720]   And did you start homeschooling intentionally?
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.200]   Oh, those are good questions.
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:00.440]   Yes, we had two children at the time.
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.720]   We now have four.
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:07.560]   I have, Will was five and Mary Claire was like three.
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.400]   And, you know, when you say intentionally,
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.560]   I guess I would say, you know,
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.080]   the first day of kindergarten.
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.280]   You know how you have that?
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:17.640]   Oh, yes, yes.
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.800]   You're five and now everyone's asking,
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:20.760]   what are you going to do?
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.120]   You know, you have all the questions
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:25.160]   and you have to sign them up.
[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.040]   I don't know if they do that.
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.240]   Oh gosh, yes, yes.
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.280]   Umbrella schools and curriculum.
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.680]   And all of a sudden it felt very official.
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.920]   You know, they're officially starting.
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.680]   We had to count days in those days.
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:37.000]   I don't know.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.040]   Oh, goodness, yes.
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:42.680]   And so it felt very public school-y,
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.440]   if that makes sense to you.
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.200]   It was like, oh, you have to have a curriculum
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.680]   and you have to have these objective standards
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:51.560]   and that sort of thing.
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.040]   And what I found was interesting
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.120]   is the way the Lord,
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.640]   and I would encourage parents,
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:59.880]   the way the Lord had been already shaping
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:04.040]   my understanding or my husband and I's understanding
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:07.640]   of a family and what is a family.
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:11.240]   And so we did intentionally choose to homeschool
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:11.960]   because I thought,
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.040]   well, I can't hurt them at kindergarten, right?
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.920]   I mean, like I had taught school before.
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.840]   I was especially a teacher for a number of years.
[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:19.560]   So I thought, well,
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:23.960]   I don't think I can mess them up too bad for kindergarten.
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.760]   And also, this is my selfishness.
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.240]   I thought, you know, by golly,
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.400]   I have changed all their diapers.
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.120]   I taught him how to potty train.
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.680]   And I saw his first steps.
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.080]   I don't want anyone else to teach him to read.
[00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:42.760]   I want him to sit in the lap,
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:47.160]   let's read a story and be the person that it's just like,
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.400]   oh, he just recognized the word cat.
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:52.280]   You know, so I wanted to be that person.
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:56.440]   So what and I, my husband and I, we, we were,
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:59.080]   and also my first one, this is interesting.
[00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.000]   The Lord gave us a wanderer.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.640]   Oh, much a person that would just stand outside
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:09.320]   and look at the sky and, and he'd meander around.
[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:10.760]   You can never find him, you know,
[00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:14.200]   and we just thought, you know,
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.840]   he's not really going to be,
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:23.080]   he would not necessarily fit in a sitting desk situation.
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:26.120]   He asked a lot of questions.
[00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:30.760]   And he's, yeah, he just, he was just kind of a free spirit.
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.200]   And he wasn't undisciplined.
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:34.200]   He just was like, explored things.
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.720]   - Right, right.
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:36.760]   Ask a lot of questions.
[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.200]   - Ask a lot of questions.
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:38.760]   - Yes.
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:42.920]   - And we just wanted to keep that spirit in a sense
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:46.120]   that wandering, delightful person.
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:52.280]   We wanted that to, to grow and, and to be nurtured.
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:56.280]   And so, yes, we intentionally, I thought, well, okay,
[00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:57.160]   it's kindergarten.
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:59.640]   I think I can, I, you know, I taught school.
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:03.400]   I think I can talk and then, and then there's, but,
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:06.200]   but I will tell you, Lisa, it's so interesting to me
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.200]   that the Lord had been working in me
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.480]   because I had been teaching.
[00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:12.520]   But even before that, as a student
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:15.960]   and college is learning to education, I had,
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:18.040]   it's always been this pull for me.
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:20.840]   On one side, it was the professional education idea
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.400]   where, you know, you have school and you have curriculum
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:25.720]   and you have objectives and you check off lists
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:28.040]   and you see your child as, well,
[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:30.200]   what have they accomplished today?
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.320]   They really, and then there was this other part of me
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:36.200]   that I had a church family, three families
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.960]   that the mothers were homeschooling.
[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:38.920]   This was back in the 80s.
[00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:39.640]   So this wasn't-
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.000]   - Right, very unusual.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.040]   - Very unusual.
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.800]   But there were very different people.
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.320]   I had been involved with our kids
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:46.920]   in all sorts of ways in the church.
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.360]   And I could think, man,
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.280]   they talk to each other differently.
[00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:53.880]   They, they use words I don't use with children.
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:56.440]   They treat them as whole beings there.
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:57.960]   And I would spend time in their homes
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:00.120]   and their homes were like this wonderful,
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.920]   it wasn't, they weren't, they were messy homes
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:04.520]   and they were normal homes,
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:08.120]   but there was something about their vision
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:10.280]   for how they treated their children
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:13.240]   as well as like very nurturing
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:15.000]   and very much a vision for,
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   this is the kind of person I want them to become,
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.440]   not the thing I want them to do.
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.360]   It was very unique.
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:26.600]   And I kept thinking, what is it about this?
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:28.280]   And, and so as,
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:30.360]   and then I had this professional education side
[00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.280]   and I worked as a special ed teacher
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:36.520]   with children who were very involved physically.
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:40.520]   So I, it, it sort of informed me like,
[00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:42.600]   and I, so I worked very closely
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.320]   with these children's, my students' parents.
[00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:47.000]   I mean, I was in their home a lot.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.880]   So I kept thinking, who are, children are people
[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:56.040]   and they have, whether they can write their name or not,
[00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:01.000]   whether this child may never be able to write their name.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.640]   Yet they're, they, they have a culture.
[00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:05.720]   They have a heritage.
[00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:06.760]   They are nurtured.
[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:11.240]   They're, they're definitely influenced by their family,
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:13.960]   but they're also influencing their family,
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:17.000]   how they're such a vital part of their family.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.520]   And then seeing how these homeschool moms treated,
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:23.400]   grew, had this vision of their own culture
[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:26.360]   and their family, I kept thinking, I want that.
[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:32.440]   I want this, I want this holistic, wholesome place
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:35.160]   where my children feel nurtured,
[00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:39.320]   not because of what they can do or how they perform,
[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:42.440]   but really who they are.
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:45.320]   Like, it's like, well, I'm sure you discovered that,
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:47.400]   like your children are not who you are.
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:50.040]   Your children are gifts from God
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:51.880]   and you're just keep unwrapping them.
[00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:53.400]   - Yes.
[00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:56.040]   - Discover things about them that I think I,
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:56.920]   I would never think that.
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:58.120]   - I would never have done that.
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.440]   I probably would not have done it that way, God.
[00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:03.400]   I mean, because it makes it harder for me
[00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:04.760]   because I don't understand that.
[00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:05.720]   - I don't understand.
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:09.240]   So I feel like, yes, we intentionally moved in that journey,
[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:13.480]   but I think the past experiences really informed,
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:16.920]   helped us both start having those conversations.
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:20.200]   Like, well, what is it these having children
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.400]   and what, who are children?
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:22.040]   - Right.
[00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:25.240]   I think that's really, that's really cool
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:28.760]   that you intentionally homeschooled
[00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:31.880]   for a variety of reasons,
[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:36.600]   but your idea of what that might mean
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:40.200]   and should mean and could mean in your family
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:45.320]   continued to evolve as you got to know your children
[00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:49.320]   and as you got to know the possibilities of homeschooling.
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:52.120]   That's actually, Amy, that is super encouraging.
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:54.760]   I know for our listeners to think,
[00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:59.160]   oh, so you don't necessarily,
[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:01.800]   everybody doesn't have it all figured out when we start.
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:03.720]   We are all just kind of,
[00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:07.080]   I think that the majority of us
[00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:10.280]   are maybe not bumbling through,
[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:13.240]   but the Lord leads us.
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:17.080]   It's a journey for us as well as for our children.
[00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:20.680]   And the Lord removes the scales from our eyes
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:24.040]   and He leads us down fresh paths.
[00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:25.960]   And we discover more and more
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:29.640]   about what He is wanting us to discover
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:33.640]   about Him, about our children,
[00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:37.880]   about ourselves, and about the journey as we go.
[00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:39.400]   So I like that.
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:41.400]   So you did begin intentionally.
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:44.840]   And it was mostly when your oldest
[00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:47.080]   was ready to start kindergarten.
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:50.120]   - But you know, that was the dilemma, right?
[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:53.320]   Because it felt like that was the official day.
[00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:56.840]   You know, I go in September 1st and whatever.
[00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:59.320]   But actually we had been, you know,
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:00.360]   and this is what I wanted to say.
[00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:06.360]   You've been teaching your children for years.
[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:09.640]   I mean, since they were infants,
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:13.480]   you're like, you know, this is how we eat our food.
[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:15.640]   This is how we say this word.
[00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:19.640]   You're revealing to them that this is how a family works.
[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:21.160]   This is how being loved works
[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:23.000]   or how going to sleep works.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.560]   Or this is what a bath is like.
[00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:27.080]   And this is why we take baths.
[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:30.040]   And then you answer all their little questions, you know.
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:33.000]   - Yes, as you live together.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.240]   - Isn't that an extension of what you do as an adult too?
[00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:38.760]   Like you're always learning.
[00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:40.680]   You're a person, you know.
[00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:42.200]   - Yes, yes.
[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:46.760]   - Stop, start at five and here's your books
[00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:48.360]   and this is your accomplishment.
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:50.680]   It's very holistic.
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:53.480]   And like you were saying, even as parents,
[00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:55.000]   you're constantly growing.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.080]   Didn't you just grow tremendously?
[00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:58.120]   - So much.
[00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:00.680]   I thought homeschooling was all about my kids.
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:03.800]   And now I wonder if it was all about me all along,
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:05.640]   what God was leading me to learn
[00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:09.960]   and how he just took him 18 years of my children's lives
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:12.520]   to shape me into half the person
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:15.000]   he really wants me to be eventually.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.320]   - Absolutely, I shamefully admit that.
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:22.520]   - Well, I know that I meet in my travels,
[00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:26.440]   I meet a lot of moms and dads at practicums
[00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:28.200]   and at other events who say,
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:32.200]   well, I know it's probably about time for us to decide
[00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:33.640]   if we're gonna homeschool or not.
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:37.000]   And I think for so many of us,
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.800]   because like you were saying, you start kindergarten
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:44.840]   and then all of a sudden there is a curriculum
[00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:48.680]   and there's a days you have to register
[00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:50.200]   and you have to count your days
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:51.960]   and you have to have a curriculum.
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:55.960]   And so that's what we think of is homeschooling begins
[00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:58.920]   when you start keeping attendance
[00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:04.600]   or marking progress reports or checking off boxes.
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:09.080]   And I remember coming to the realization
[00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:12.280]   that the Lord might be calling us to homeschool.
[00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:14.680]   And I was stroking out over,
[00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:17.640]   when am I going to start homeschooling?
[00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:20.040]   And I had a friend, a dear friend,
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:21.560]   who's actually at the time,
[00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:24.600]   the family were missionaries in Brazil
[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:25.880]   and they were home on furlough
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:27.640]   and had come to stay with us for a while.
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:30.120]   And she had been with us for about a week
[00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:32.040]   and she was a homeschooling mom.
[00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:34.040]   And I thought, yeah, but you're on the mission field.
[00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:36.200]   So obviously that's what you're gonna do.
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:38.440]   And I was talking to her about,
[00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:40.920]   I'm thinking I'm considering homeschooling,
[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:44.920]   but I'm not really sure when to start or how to start.
[00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:47.720]   And I'm not really sure that I'm really up for this.
[00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:51.160]   And she looked at me so funny and she said,
[00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:53.560]   what are you even talking about?
[00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:56.760]   She said, I have lived with you for a week
[00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:59.320]   and I have watched you with your children.
[00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:02.360]   You are already homeschooling.
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:05.640]   What do you mean you're already doing it?
[00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:09.400]   And I said, but I don't have a curriculum.
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:13.160]   She said, you, like you were just saying, Amy,
[00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:17.400]   you are teaching your child how to set the table
[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:21.320]   and how to fix breakfast and how to serve a guest
[00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:27.080]   and how to take turns and how to go to the library
[00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:29.560]   and how to keep up with your belongings.
[00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:33.160]   And what makes the sun rise?
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:35.960]   And why is it cooler now?
[00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:38.200]   And why does the moon follow me?
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:41.320]   And she said, you're answering all of the questions.
[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:44.040]   She said, you're already homeschooling.
[00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:49.400]   But I suspect a lot of our listeners
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:53.960]   were saying to themselves the things that you and I said, Amy.
[00:17:53.960 --> 00:18:00.680]   We have to have a curriculum when we start homeschooling.
[00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:03.160]   If we're going to really homeschool,
[00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:07.800]   we need to have a start date and we need to have a schedule
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:11.560]   and we need to have a daily lesson plan
[00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:14.760]   and we need to have a space dedicated in our home
[00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:16.280]   where we always go and sit
[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:19.720]   and we need to have a routine or a schedule.
[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:25.640]   And so we think that even when our children are really little
[00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:28.520]   and we know they're not really ready
[00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:32.360]   for a regimented kind of day,
[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:38.200]   that that would be very odd and hard for all of us to get used to.
[00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:42.680]   Yeah, but we get so anxious about it
[00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:49.320]   because in our minds, there is school and homeschool.
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:51.960]   And then there's before we start.
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:53.560]   And I just want us to think,
[00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:59.480]   I think that one of my desires with this podcast
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:02.760]   is for us to blur those lines a little bit,
[00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:06.840]   to realize that the camera's really kind of blurred there.
[00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:08.680]   The edges are very blurred.
[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:14.200]   If you're going to begin homeschooling
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:17.400]   with your three and four and five-year-old even,
[00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:25.160]   it might not need to look like you always thought it needed to look.
[00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:27.160]   Amy, let me ask you this.
[00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:32.760]   Is there a real line between homeschooling and not homeschooling yet?
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:36.920]   Yes, I think part of it is--
[00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:40.760]   and this is what we have to wrestle with.
[00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:43.080]   And it's a good wrestling, Lisa.
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:49.800]   It's a very important definition
[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:55.160]   that we need to really hammer out within our family culture.
[00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:58.920]   What is education?
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:05.160]   What does that mean?
[00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:14.680]   And what kind of human being are we becoming?
[00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:16.200]   And how does that work?
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:19.400]   And I think that there's really not--
[00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:26.760]   if you think of education in terms of learning about the world
[00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:30.040]   and other people and the culture,
[00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:33.720]   and if you think about education in a very broad sense,
[00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:37.960]   there's not a line because we're doing it all the time.
[00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:39.080]   I'm still doing it.
[00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:40.120]   You're still doing it.
[00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:44.440]   We're still learning and growing because we're eternal beings.
[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:49.640]   God is shaping and forming us as believers into the conformity of Christ.
[00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:54.280]   And that encompasses a whole lot of things.
[00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:59.960]   The world is a really big, complicated, deep, rich, wide, open place.
[00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:05.000]   So, and it's going to take more than a lifetime, right, to discover all that.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.960]   So that's the journey God has us on.
[00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:15.160]   And I think what the struggle with us is that our education,
[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:20.680]   I'm saying our public education system really, really narrows that vision.
[00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:28.200]   Very, very, very, very, very small and very, very fragmented and different.
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:34.280]   And they label it different parts as if you're a different parts,
[00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:36.600]   like you're a reading person or you're--
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:37.240]   Right.
[00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:38.520]   This is your math part.
[00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:42.440]   Or this is, we're going to socialize you now
[00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:46.760]   because you're going to learn how to deal with your neighbor and who is your neighbor.
[00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:51.640]   And it's all like relegated instead of going, that's not who we--
[00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:54.040]   that's just very unnatural.
[00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:54.600]   That's just not--
[00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:59.400]   Right, that's actually not how the world is.
[00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:00.440]   No, no.
[00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:08.520]   I mean, hardly ever do you function with just in a room with 28 people who are your same age.
[00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:09.000]   Well, and--
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:09.640]   When is that?
[00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:11.560]   That never happens in real life.
[00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:16.520]   And what does that mean if I'm 25 and there are other 25-year-olds?
[00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:18.120]   Are we all the same?
[00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:21.880]   Are we all going to learn in the same way, in the same pattern?
[00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:24.920]   Like, oh, I know calculus and you don't.
[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:28.840]   So you must not be up to par on being a 25-year-old.
[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:30.920]   It's so unnatural to think--
[00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:32.040]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:40.760]   So peer-oriented and so much like this standardized idea of how we move even through stages.
[00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:44.440]   I mean, people say, oh, you're a late bloomer.
[00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:45.560]   What does that mean?
[00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:48.760]   Like, are we on time for something?
[00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:57.400]   And so I think the way the homeschooling is like, to me, it's much more you are--
[00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:02.920]   You must study, naturally study your children.
[00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:09.720]   You study and you think and you pray and you talk to your spouse and you talk to your community
[00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:13.000]   and like, hey, it seems like they're struggling here.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.240]   Is that struggling or are they just not ready?
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:19.480]   And I think that's a really good struggle.
[00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:24.440]   I think that's a really good wrestling God allows us to go through, because we have to
[00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:31.720]   come out with what's the definition of who our family is, what we believe, how we want
[00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:37.640]   to treat one another, who we want to invite into our home, and how we want to serve people.
[00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:39.320]   And how do we want to pray?
[00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:43.160]   How do I want to expose them to what the world is like?
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:45.960]   Do I want them exposed in this way or that?
[00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:49.160]   How am I going to-- how are we going to shepherd, protect?
[00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:50.360]   And I don't know.
[00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:55.720]   To me, it's much like you said, the line is-- there's not a line.
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:24:00.040]   Like, one day I'm going to start learning something because I'm five and then up until
[00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:01.080]   then, nope.
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:09.720]   It's just-- and we're sort of told that it doesn't-- our world doesn't validate our humanity
[00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:18.760]   well, and I think we are tempted-- and I'm totally this person-- tempted to validate
[00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:27.800]   our schooling by going back to that model that we were familiar-- or I was familiar
[00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:28.440]   with.
[00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:31.320]   Absolutely, when we feel like we need a checklist.
[00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:32.360]   Yeah, there's a lesson--
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:33.560]   Or a progress report.
[00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:34.680]   A progress report.
[00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:39.000]   And at the end of the day, or like, did you make a percentage?
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.920]   Did you know all the answers?
[00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:44.200]   That's good.
[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:46.040]   Did you know half the answers?
[00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:47.160]   That's bad.
[00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:52.760]   You know, so I've been sort of conditioned to believe that, and we are kind of put on
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:56.120]   the spotlight when people ask us, "Well, what do you do every day?"
[00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:59.160]   You know, my child always said, "Well, nothing really."
[00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:00.120]   I know!
[00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:03.800]   My kids-- I remember one answer.
[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:08.760]   My older child said, "Oh, well, we never really did school at all until Sarah was in
[00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:09.480]   kindergarten."
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:13.880]   Well, by then, Stephanie was in the third grade, and I'm like, "Oh, my stars.
[00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:15.160]   They're going to come for me."
[00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:21.400]   That's not the truth, but then-- but now I can look back and be very pleased.
[00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:27.000]   I'm actually very excited for those three years of her life.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   She was learning so much, but she didn't think that was school because it was so interesting
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.040]   and it was so fun.
[00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:36.600]   And so that's actually awesome.
[00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:44.680]   See, I know now, and I can tell from listening to you, I know now that to begin homeschooling,
[00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:51.800]   like all these people are asking me, to begin homeschooling, I did not need a full curriculum
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:26:01.160]   or a heavily planned schedule, but just like you're saying, Amy, I did need to have thought
[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:07.880]   about what I wanted my kids to learn and why I wanted them to know those things.
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:13.720]   And I needed to know something about how I would like to introduce them to people and
[00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:16.120]   places and ideas.
[00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:18.680]   So why is that pre-thinking?
[00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:22.840]   Because, you know, I'll be honest, people come up and they say, "Okay, I'm ready to
[00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:24.040]   start homeschooling my kids.
[00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:26.680]   I think it's time for us to start homeschooling."
[00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:29.720]   And they ask me about a curriculum and a schedule.
[00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:35.560]   But I would like to say to people, that's actually not the first thing.
[00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:40.280]   Actually, the first thing is to think about, like what you were saying, what do we want
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:41.800]   our family to be like?
[00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:47.640]   What are our family's-- what are our family's goals and what are our family's rules and
[00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:50.200]   what are our family's priorities?
[00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:54.360]   And how do we want to learn and how much do we want to do together?
[00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:59.480]   Why are those--why is that pre-thinking stuff so important, Amy?
[00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:09.240]   >> Well, I think what it does is it brings us back again to--it forces us to think, well,
[00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:11.320]   what is the definition of a family?
[00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:14.840]   It's the first culture God has designed, right?
[00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:24.920]   He designed this beautiful culture of dad, mom, and child, and that there are children
[00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:26.920]   and he says, "These are blessings.
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:29.800]   These are blessings that he's bestowed on us."
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:38.440]   And so seeing that in light of that, that--and he also reminds us like when you're standing
[00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:45.880]   up or walking or eating at the table, that you are testifying to the goodness of his
[00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:46.600]   nature.
[00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:50.760]   And then we're helping children recognize like, look, here's the Lord.
[00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:56.280]   Look, he created this world or what you're interested in, you know, this turtle or this
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:28:04.680]   cloud or, you know, you are--like you said, you're under--you're thinking and praying
[00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:05.800]   and being deliberate.
[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:12.520]   I want to say this is not just Harry Carey, you know, you're not just like, "Oh, well,
[00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:14.040]   what's our day going to be like?"
[00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:15.000]   It's not like that.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:22.440]   It's like, what is the shaping and forming of this culture that we're creating?
[00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:24.280]   And we're creating a heritage.
[00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:25.720]   I mean, you see it in your family.
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:28.920]   You have grandchildren, and they're going to have children, and they're going to have
[00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:29.480]   children.
[00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:36.120]   So what is it that the Lord would call us and how he would want us to shape our family?
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:42.520]   And I think that that pre-thinking and just spending time praying and studying your children
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:46.360]   and recognize the uniqueness of your own home.
[00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:47.720]   Like, where has he put us?
[00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:49.000]   Has he put us in a neighborhood?
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.360]   Has he put us on a farm?
[00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:51.880]   Has he put us in an apartment?
[00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:53.880]   Has he put us--where has he put us?
[00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:55.800]   What church setting has he put us in?
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:29:03.400]   And so the rhythm of the day, I would strongly recommend that you don't have to have a schedule,
[00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:05.640]   like at 9.02 we do this and 9.03.
[00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:11.640]   But saying, "Okay, we have a predictable rhythm of our day, and I want to think about
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:12.600]   what that looks like."
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:19.160]   Like if dad doesn't go to work until 10 a.m., mom needs to sleep in because she's a nurse
[00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:24.200]   or whatever, then contemplate, like, "Okay, here's the rhythm of our day.
[00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:29.960]   We take Fridays off because dad is home or we work on Saturday because of that."
[00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:32.600]   You know, think about the rhythm of your family.
[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:37.480]   It doesn't have to sit in a strict, like, eight o'clock to three o'clock.
[00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:38.520]   The bus drops them off.
[00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:40.280]   You know, it's not like that.
[00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:47.640]   So really allowing yourself the freedom to examine the uniqueness of your family and
[00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:51.000]   then incorporating a rhythm to your family.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:59.880]   And then, yeah, the curriculum is pretty much, it can be a life curriculum, right?
[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:04.360]   But it's also like how, look around, what community are we in?
[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:05.880]   How can we serve other people?
[00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:08.440]   How do we start our day?
[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:12.760]   Like in prayer, help them to, you know, they delight in what you delight in.
[00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:18.920]   So finding your delight in the Lord and seeking Him, like letting them see you pray, letting
[00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:23.160]   them see this is how we serve one another in our home and how we serve people outside
[00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:23.800]   our home.
[00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:26.680]   What are some things that are exciting to explore?
[00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:32.600]   And that's where, to me, that exploration stage, or it's where you can really start
[00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:33.000]   incorporating.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   If you want curriculum, just listen to your kids.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.800]   Like, what are they really interested in?
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:44.440]   And then looking for, I don't know, salamanders.
[00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:51.800]   Well, go to the prairie and go to the aquarium and look around in a stream and draw some
[00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:52.680]   pictures.
[00:30:52.680 --> 00:31:00.440]   And, you know, that start, I think it really, for younger kids, it really helps if you sort
[00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:08.360]   of start your own curriculum exploration, like give it a shot, you know, just say, you
[00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:10.600]   know, we're just going to give it a shot this way.
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:15.080]   We're going to listen to what do you want to learn about, and then we're going to figure
[00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:15.640]   it out.
[00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:17.880]   And then I'm going to examine it at the end of the week.
[00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:20.760]   Well, hey, how did that work?
[00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:22.200]   You know, did we write?
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:23.720]   Did we learn any words?
[00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:25.960]   Like, did we learn any new words?
[00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:27.880]   Maybe we learned what a hellbender was.
[00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:29.400]   I never know what a salamander was.
[00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:32.200]   Maybe we went to the aquarium.
[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:39.800]   You know, just I think you'll be surprised at what you, your children learn.
[00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:43.160]   They're just natural little learners.
[00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:45.800]   And I don't think you have to have it all together.
[00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:47.720]   Yeah, I know you don't, because I never did.
[00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:49.320]   And I know you really don't.
[00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:50.440]   And you don't.
[00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:57.560]   For those moms and dads who are listening, who say, okay, I'm talking about, I feel like,
[00:31:57.560 --> 00:32:02.760]   you know, my three-year-old and my four-year-old are ready to do something.
[00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:05.080]   And I'm not trying to teach them to read.
[00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:08.840]   I know that I don't need a quote unquote curriculum.
[00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:13.800]   But what is it that I'm supposed to be doing?
[00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:17.080]   If I say I'm going to start homeschooling them, what would it look like?
[00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:20.360]   Amy, you have given some beautiful ideas.
[00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:27.320]   So you don't have to have a schedule where every day at nine o'clock you do this and
[00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:29.320]   every day at two o'clock you do that.
[00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:40.840]   But having a rhythm or a routine is actually very comforting to children.
[00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:48.040]   They actually like enough of a routine that things are predictable.
[00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:49.480]   It makes them feel safe.
[00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:52.280]   It helps them feel a little bit in control.
[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:55.720]   Because let's face it, a three-year-old is not in control of much.
[00:32:55.720 --> 00:33:00.360]   And hello, at home should not be the one in control of the family.
[00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:01.800]   That's a big mistake.
[00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:04.680]   If you have made that mistake, you are already feeling the effects.
[00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:08.120]   But having things be predictable.
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:18.600]   So it may be that a rhythm or routine might look like every morning you snuggle in bed
[00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:24.120]   to wake up, and you read a Bible verse, and you get up and you make the bed.
[00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:28.840]   And they know that after that, every morning we're going to eat breakfast, and then we're
[00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:32.200]   going to brush our teeth, and then we'll do some little chores.
[00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:35.640]   And everybody has their own chore, and then maybe you rotate.
[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:42.920]   And maybe every morning you read, and then every morning you play outside.
[00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:47.960]   And then there's lots of things, like Amy was describing, that fit into there.
[00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:55.640]   Maybe you are really interested in why are the leaves in the backyard red, and they used
[00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:56.840]   to be green.
[00:33:56.840 --> 00:34:02.280]   So maybe you're going to read The Fall of Freddy the Leaf, or you're going to go to
[00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:08.840]   the library and find books about what happens to the forest in the fall, or what doesn't
[00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:11.240]   happen to the forest in the fall, depending on where you live.
[00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:17.320]   And then you're going to go outside and play, and you're going to collect things that weren't
[00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:18.920]   there two months ago.
[00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:21.560]   Why are there acorns on the ground now?
[00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:24.360]   But it's a routine.
[00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:28.840]   And then people eat lunch, and then you have nap time, or maybe you have quiet in your
[00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:30.280]   room with a book time.
[00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:33.080]   These are predictable things.
[00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:35.000]   It's not a schedule.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.080]   And you can change it up.
[00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:44.920]   But if you are looking for something that says, "I am now intentionally doing something,"
[00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:51.480]   a routine is very comforting for a little child, but it also helps you as the mom or
[00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:59.560]   dad, the homeschool parent, to feel like you are intentionally creating an atmosphere of
[00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:00.840]   family learning.
[00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:02.440]   Yes, exactly.
[00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:03.800]   That's exactly right.
[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:10.920]   And the routine, you're not recreating the day from scratch every day.
[00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:11.420]   Right.
[00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:12.600]   It's exhausting.
[00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:17.000]   If you've been a first year teacher, and you get through the first week, and you go,
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.240]   "I've got to do 50 more weeks of this," you cannot do it.
[00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:24.600]   You cannot make Disney World every day in your home.
[00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:25.880]   You cannot do that.
[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:28.200]   And it's not healthy for your children.
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:32.280]   So to me, that rhythm, that routine, we all thrive on that.
[00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:37.800]   And as a mother, I felt like it was sort of expected.
[00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:39.080]   So it kind of carried.
[00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:42.360]   I wasn't pushing the rock up the hill every day like, "Okay, yes."
[00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:43.420]   Surprise.
[00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:44.840]   Do chores.
[00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:46.680]   Like, no, every day we do chores.
[00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:49.720]   Now, sometimes, a lot of times, we got resistance.
[00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:51.560]   Like, "Why do I have to empty the dishwasher?"
[00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:54.040]   And you're like, "Okay, but this is what we do."
[00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:57.320]   It just helped everyone know what their expectations were.
[00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:01.160]   And that also helped with discipline.
[00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:05.800]   Like, when you did have a child that complained or was like, whined, that they have to go
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:07.000]   to devotions.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.600]   Yes, of course.
[00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:16.760]   Here's a great opportunity for us to learn about our character is to practice the self-discipline
[00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:20.120]   or to fold our hands when we pray instead of poke our neighbor.
[00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:23.000]   You know, those are ways.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.400]   And isn't that the way God teaches us?
[00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:27.560]   He's like, there's those rhythms.
[00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:33.560]   And when we rail against those, it's like we get disciplined or God shows us something
[00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:38.440]   about ourselves that we're like, "Wow, I didn't realize that I had a struggle
[00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:39.400]   with obedience."
[00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:42.200]   You know, it's just how He teaches us.
[00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:47.480]   And I think, honestly, you as parents are really their curriculum.
[00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:51.880]   Your love for them and your delight in things and the way you manage.
[00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:55.960]   And it's not perfection, the way you seek forgiveness.
[00:36:55.960 --> 00:37:00.280]   I mean, I think even apologizing to your children sometimes like, "Mommy was grouchy.
[00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:00.920]   I'm so sorry."
[00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:07.800]   That really, those lessons, Lisa, are the hidden ones.
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:11.160]   And it is so, it is.
[00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:12.520]   It's very beautiful.
[00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:19.800]   And when you are learning alongside your children, when you are with them every day, you see
[00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:28.600]   those little foibles that come up so easily and so surely in all of our children.
[00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:33.960]   But it also, when you are with them every day and you think, "Okay, A, I don't want
[00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:35.320]   to always deal with this.
[00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:37.720]   I don't want to have to deal with this every day.
[00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:40.040]   We need to find a solution to this."
[00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:44.360]   But when you're with your child every day, you know your child's personality.
[00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:49.960]   And you know when, "Okay, so this is defiance, but this is anything.
[00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:54.200]   Weariness, fear, anxiety, hunger.
[00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:56.200]   And what do I need?
[00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:57.000]   What is this?
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:58.280]   What is this child?
[00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:00.040]   Who is this child?
[00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:02.920]   And how can I help this child to cope?"
[00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:08.120]   I know with my grandson, who's two, pretty verbal too.
[00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:16.680]   So he will, he has, oh, sometimes he does not want to, he just wants to do what he wants
[00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:17.560]   to do.
[00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:21.080]   And he is quite persistent in that.
[00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:22.200]   Want to do this.
[00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:23.240]   Want to do this.
[00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:24.120]   Want to do this.
[00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:25.960]   And you try to distract him.
[00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:32.760]   What we have discovered works with him is when he gets, when he starts to kind of spin
[00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:39.000]   out of control because this thing he wants to do or wants to see is not going to be forthcoming
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.880]   right away, we will say to him, "That cannot happen."
[00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:42.840]   I'll hold his hand.
[00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:44.840]   "But do you want me to tell you the plan?"
[00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:47.560]   And he's like, "Yes."
[00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:49.160]   And I said, "Okay, this is the plan.
[00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:52.840]   First, we are going to change sister.
[00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:55.800]   Then we are going to get a milk drink.
[00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:57.960]   Then we are going to find your shoes.
[00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:01.400]   Then we are going to go outside.
[00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:04.520]   And if it is still raining, we will stomp in the puddles."
[00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:09.240]   And so then he's like, "Okay, he can go with the plan."
[00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:15.640]   But, you know, you would think, I don't need to explain this to a two-year-old.
[00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:17.400]   I just need to say, "No, not now."
[00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:19.400]   But that's not where he is.
[00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:21.880]   He's actually in the thinking about it.
[00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:23.400]   Why can't I do it now?
[00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:25.240]   And that works for him.
[00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:34.840]   So for parents who are thinking, "I feel like I need to be doing something intentionally.
[00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:39.160]   If I'm going to be homeschooling, it needs to look like something."
[00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:42.920]   Well, I want you to hold the "look like something" very loosely.
[00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:50.040]   It can be just as broad as we were saying that that routine is.
[00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:53.000]   But the pieces can look different.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:58.520]   What's inside each activity could look different every day.
[00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:03.800]   And listen, the duration of each piece might be different every day.
[00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:07.560]   Amy, did you always do the same thing for the same amount of time every day?
[00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:09.560]   I don't remember.
[00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:12.520]   I told my daughter who's homeschooling.
[00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:18.120]   I probably, in the 20-something years we homeschooled, maybe had 10 days that went, quote,
[00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:20.440]   "well," or like I thought.
[00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:21.080]   Maybe.
[00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:21.400]   Maybe.
[00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:22.680]   I don't even know if there were 10.
[00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:23.400]   No.
[00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:26.520]   Because you're dealing with human beings.
[00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:34.920]   If I was working in a factory, I could say I turned out 20,000 chocolate bonbons.
[00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:37.640]   And that would be measured.
[00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:40.120]   And I would get a pat on the head and send home.
[00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:43.960]   But that's just not how people work.
[00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:49.320]   If you look at even in terms of Scripture, there's nothing.
[00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:52.600]   There's so many unpredictable things that people do.
[00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:57.880]   And God works very individualistically with us.
[00:40:57.880 --> 00:40:59.560]   He knows.
[00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:00.840]   He knows our form.
[00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:03.400]   He knows before words are on our mouth.
[00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:04.600]   I mean, He knows us.
[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:05.880]   He knows us so well.
[00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:09.880]   And we invite Him to search us and know us.
[00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:16.120]   So there's this beauty of, and I think that's the loveliness of being a parent.
[00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:21.880]   It is so amazing that we get to study a human being.
[00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:29.320]   We get to, like you said, discover things about children like, oh, like this child,
[00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:32.520]   they need quiet in the afternoon.
[00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:33.080]   Yes.
[00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:38.040]   This child needs to run and fill the floor.
[00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:41.880]   This child, this child is a wiggle worm, you know.
[00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:44.600]   This child is going to ask a million questions.
[00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:45.480]   I have one.
[00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:49.800]   It's like Gideon, like what he would like, what's first?
[00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:51.000]   What second he would ask?
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   Well, what are we doing today?
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.120]   It used to drive me crazy.
[00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:55.720]   I think, well, why does he keep asking?
[00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:57.880]   I know, what's it to you, kid?
[00:41:57.880 --> 00:42:00.600]   Why does it matter?
[00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:02.520]   But it really mattered to him.
[00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:05.320]   Like he knew how to anticipate for his day.
[00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:09.000]   And so we would just stop and say, well, now we're going to do this.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:10.440]   And then next we're going to do this.
[00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:12.600]   And then after that, we're going to, you know, do this.
[00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:14.760]   And that was just settling.
[00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:16.520]   And we're all different like that.
[00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:22.520]   And I tried just giving ourselves the grace to apply to others.
[00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:23.240]   We are not.
[00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:26.600]   And, and also to realize you're not going to get it right.
[00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:30.680]   You're, you're not, you're, you're going to wrong sometimes.
[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:36.760]   And I feel like what I loved about the Lord is he would reassure us that if I got it wrong
[00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:42.520]   the first time, bye, cracky, I would have to, it would be another time.
[00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:49.240]   I would practice the skill of not getting frustrated or understanding what long suffering
[00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:56.120]   means, not in a bad way, but knowing how to appreciate someone, to put someone else's
[00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:57.560]   interest ahead of my own.
[00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:03.720]   I mean, I found out how much selfish ambition and empty could see my lands when I had children.
[00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:06.520]   It was so bad.
[00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:11.480]   And I just think sometimes offering ourselves the grace and the grace to our children to
[00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:17.800]   recognize God has put a, you're only going to have one Gideon in the entire, if you think
[00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:24.840]   about it, one Gideon of all the billions of people that are born on this world, in this
[00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:27.480]   world, only one, you know?
[00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:30.120]   And so what privilege?
[00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:35.400]   I just think, my goodness, what else could I be doing that's better than that?
[00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:41.160]   You know, like, I don't know what I could be investing in, except this eternal little
[00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:41.560]   being.
[00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:42.520]   That's right.
[00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:44.760]   You're shepherding this little soul.
[00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:46.760]   It's remarkable.
[00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:47.480]   Yes.
[00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:55.320]   You know, it's the kind of thing where we think homeschool is only about teaching our
[00:43:55.320 --> 00:44:04.600]   child to read, or to relate to numbers well, or to be able to orient events in time, or
[00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:13.880]   look at something under a microscope and know how to, you know, move the eyepiece so that
[00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:15.160]   we can see it clearly.
[00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:19.320]   We think all of those things as school, all of those things as homeschooling.
[00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:26.600]   But listen, parents of three and four-year-olds are not primarily considering those things.
[00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:29.480]   So what are we hoping to do?
[00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:37.080]   Well, you are hoping to raise a child who is unselfish, as far as a three and four-year-old
[00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:39.080]   can be unselfish.
[00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:44.920]   You're trying to raise a child who knows how to take turns and to sit quietly.
[00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:47.320]   So what are some, Amy, help me think.
[00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:56.760]   What are some of those foundational ideas, like kindness and sharing, and some of those
[00:44:56.760 --> 00:45:02.920]   foundational skills, like tying your shoe and setting the table?
[00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:10.840]   Things that aren't academic, but that are awesome starting points for shepherding these
[00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:14.520]   little souls into their growing up years.
[00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:15.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:25.560]   I think, and I would just say, you know, definitely you have good manners, like how you greet
[00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:30.920]   people, or, you know, maybe you want to visit someone.
[00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:37.880]   Like our young ones, sometimes their great-grandmother, you know, older people look a little untouchable.
[00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:44.200]   Just kind of helping them understand about people and how to greet people, you know,
[00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:52.520]   how to wash your hands, you know, how to help another child, like playing with a younger
[00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:56.120]   sibling on, like on their terms instead of your terms.
[00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:57.400]   That's really tricky.
[00:45:58.360 --> 00:46:04.520]   And understand that, and you can model those things, you know, how to celebrate the day,
[00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:08.680]   like, ooh, what can, what fun thing did you do to help them report back?
[00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:14.200]   What are some, let's think about some things that were fun today, and what we can be thankful
[00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:20.680]   for, and not in a heavy handed way, but just like, wasn't it fun to take that walk today?
[00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:24.040]   Wasn't that a surprise when we saw daddy come home?
[00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:30.760]   You know, I think just helping them recognize or drawing attention to things in their day,
[00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:36.280]   in the rhythm of their day that are really good things, or like, ooh, it really hurt,
[00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:41.720]   you know, so-and-so's feelings when we were unkind, you know, and having those conversations
[00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:48.520]   about behavior, but also character, and also just like how you use a spoon, or how do you
[00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:49.640]   set the table?
[00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:51.000]   Yes, yes.
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:54.920]   Little things that that's a way we, let's go pick flowers for the table tonight, you
[00:46:54.920 --> 00:47:00.520]   know, little decorations and helping them recognize that that blesses and helps other
[00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:07.240]   people feel good, you know, but also there are just, educate yourself as a mom or dad,
[00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:09.880]   like, what are some little things they should be doing?
[00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:11.160]   Can they skip yet?
[00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:15.400]   Or one foot, can they ride a tricycle?
[00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:18.600]   Or can they hold a pencil or a crayon?
[00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:20.680]   Get them to just scribble.
[00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:26.520]   Yeah, there are all kinds of things that will help them develop large muscle coordination
[00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:28.280]   and small muscle coordination.
[00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:34.360]   And there are, for three and four year olds, there are all kinds of activities that will
[00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:41.640]   lead to reading and writing that aren't, that you would say, but that's not, that's not
[00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:43.000]   learning how to read.
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:48.680]   But learning how to track from left to right is part of learning how to read.
[00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:51.320]   So, so what do you do?
[00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:57.720]   So when you're reading before, before nap time, put your finger under the words that
[00:47:57.720 --> 00:47:59.960]   you're reading and move from left to right.
[00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:05.720]   Or when you are doing puzzles with your kids, take all the puzzle pieces out and put them
[00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:07.720]   to the left of the puzzle.
[00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:12.760]   And then you're moving from left to right to put the puzzle back together.
[00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:14.760]   Things like, things like that.
[00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:20.280]   Things like identifying letters and identifying numbers.
[00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:25.960]   When you're at the store or riding down the road or taking a walk, you can do it with
[00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:30.600]   house numbers or finding patterns is great.
[00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:40.360]   I can remember not realizing that finding patterns, seeing patterns in the world is
[00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:40.860]   math.
[00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:46.840]   And I can remember when my oldest daughter was really little, she went through this phase
[00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:49.960]   where she wanted to play blocks like all the time.
[00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:52.440]   I mean, so often, so much blocks.
[00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:56.200]   And I would just, you know, I would get enough of the blocks pretty fast.
[00:48:56.200 --> 00:49:01.960]   I realized that I was playing the blocks beside of her.
[00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:07.000]   She didn't always need me to be, you know, making the story or the tower with her.
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:12.440]   And so I was picking up blocks and I was, I didn't really realize that I was laying
[00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:18.040]   them down in color patterns just to keep my brain from just turning to mush as we sat
[00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:19.320]   there on the floor for hours.
[00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:26.040]   And then one day she looked to see what I was doing and she watched me for a while.
[00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:29.080]   And then she reached over and picked up the next block.
[00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:31.560]   And it was the continuation of the pattern.
[00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:35.400]   And I had no idea that she was paying attention.
[00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:36.680]   That's a math skill.
[00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:38.600]   That's a math skill.
[00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:41.720]   Making cookies is a math skill because it's measurement.
[00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:43.720]   Playing with water.
[00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:46.680]   Gideon the other night was in the big bathtub at my house.
[00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:49.400]   He loves Lolly's bathtub because it's big.
[00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:54.600]   And he had two cups in his hand, little plastic cups, and they were similar in size, but not
[00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:55.400]   exact.
[00:49:55.400 --> 00:49:59.480]   And so he was filling the water up and then he'd pour all the blue cup into the green
[00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:01.800]   cup and then all the green cup into the blue cup.
[00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:04.440]   And he went back and forth like that for a while.
[00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:06.840]   And then he was not really paying attention to me.
[00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:11.320]   He was looking down, he said almost to himself, and he held up the green cup and he said,
[00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:13.080]   "That's the big one."
[00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:16.200]   You know, it's like, "That's my word.
[00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:16.680]   You're right."
[00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:21.160]   And so then he played for a while and then he said, "The blue one is little."
[00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:22.520]   And then he just went on.
[00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:24.760]   You know, they're making observations.
[00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:37.480]   So intentional play, there are ways that you can make play intentional and winsome and
[00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:41.240]   engaging for little people and big people.
[00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:42.920]   And that's best.
[00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:46.520]   That's the best way to usher your family into homeschooling.
[00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:47.960]   - It is.
[00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:55.640]   And it's just, if you can imagine from the time those, that infant to the time they're
[00:50:55.640 --> 00:51:01.080]   three, think of everything they have learned in those three years.
[00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:08.600]   Think it is absolutely amazing what their little brains and bodies are doing and discovering
[00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:09.400]   and learning.
[00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:14.600]   You don't have to do much more than just, if they can think about a three year, think
[00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:15.240]   about Gideon.
[00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:16.440]   Was he two?
[00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:17.480]   - Yeah, he's two.
[00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:20.120]   - He's walking.
[00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:22.040]   He was an infant.
[00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:24.920]   He probably, I don't know, weighed seven pounds, you know.
[00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:32.520]   And just the Lord has so blessed our children with that natural interest, the natural proclivity
[00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:33.880]   to learn and move.
[00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:39.480]   And I think sometimes I just limited them because of my own limitations of understanding
[00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:44.520]   what you need to do this when in front of you, there is so much in your home.
[00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:46.600]   You don't have to buy lots of stuff.
[00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:52.200]   There's so much around that you can just like, yes, pouring water, like hours.
[00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:54.600]   - Yes, playing in the sink.
[00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:57.080]   My girls like to play Polly's in the sink.
[00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:57.880]   Yes, they did.
[00:51:57.880 --> 00:52:05.800]   - Yes, so just being aware and being open to understanding how this person, this is
[00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:12.280]   a person that God has designed and you get the privilege of being part of how you shape
[00:52:12.280 --> 00:52:15.800]   and form them and just asking the Lord to open my eyes.
[00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:16.840]   That's what I had to do.
[00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:24.520]   Show me because I was pretty limited in my vision at first, but the Lord is gracious.
[00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:26.360]   - I love that, Amy.
[00:52:26.360 --> 00:52:28.120]   I love that.
[00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:30.280]   So moms and dads, this is what we're saying.
[00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:41.480]   Don't let your idea of home-centered education be dictated by the narrow version of education
[00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:45.800]   you may have had as you were growing up.
[00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:55.080]   Realize that your family can learn together and with your really young children that you
[00:52:55.080 --> 00:53:04.280]   want to ease into the homeschool journey, you can teach a plethora of things through
[00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:11.880]   intentional play, through conversation, and through wonder and imagination.
[00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:17.640]   And that is the perfect, that's the perfect path for the beginning of your homeschool
[00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:18.120]   journey.
[00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:27.560]   We think that you will enjoy it more than you ever believed possible if you can relax
[00:53:27.560 --> 00:53:30.040]   and enjoy the journey with your kids.
[00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:38.120]   I want to tell you, though, if you still are interested and you want to know what maybe
[00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:44.040]   it would look like in a few more years when you are ready for a community, when you are
[00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:51.880]   ready for maybe a little more intentional learning, a little more structured play, you
[00:53:51.880 --> 00:53:59.000]   may be interested in what makes our classical conversations groups unique.
[00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:06.360]   If you are interested in homeschooling or interested in the classical conversations
[00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:18.520]   communities you hear so much about, you can go online to classicalconversations.com/events
[00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:23.480]   and find out about local open houses near you.
[00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:29.240]   You will discover our Christ-centered classical approach to education.
[00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:36.520]   And you'll meet some other CC parents, some experienced CC parents, and you can get instant
[00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:39.800]   answers to some of your homeschooling questions.
[00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:44.440]   So find an information near you or even one online.
[00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:47.000]   Go to classicalconversations.com/events.
[00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:56.280]   Well, I hope that this has given you some good things to think about and maybe been
[00:54:56.280 --> 00:54:58.280]   a little bit of an encouragement, too.
[00:54:58.280 --> 00:55:04.360]   Amy, I appreciate walking down memory lane with you and getting some good ideas from
[00:55:04.360 --> 00:55:06.920]   you that I'm going to use with my grandkids.
[00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:09.000]   So I appreciate you being with me today.
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:10.840]   It's been a lovely conversation.
[00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:11.720]   Thank you, Lisa.
[00:55:11.720 --> 00:55:12.840]   It's a lot of fun.
[00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:13.960]   Yeah, I love it.
