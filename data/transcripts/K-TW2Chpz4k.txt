[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.120]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.160]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.040]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.440]   Today, we are discussing dopamine.
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.360]   Dopamine is a topic that I've covered before on this podcast,
[00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.800]   and many people have heard of dopamine.
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.720]   Most people know that dopamine is involved in pleasure
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.080]   to some extent or another.
[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.340]   And nowadays, people are starting to appreciate
[00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.120]   that dopamine is also intimately involved
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.560]   with motivation, drive, and pursuit.
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.360]   Well, today, you're going to learn that indeed,
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.180]   dopamine is responsible for all of those things,
[00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.280]   but you are also going to learn that dopamine is critical
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.720]   for overcoming procrastination,
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.360]   for ensuring ongoing motivation,
[00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.760]   and indeed, for ensuring confidence.
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.800]   In fact, we are going to talk about the relationship
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.880]   between dopamine and motivation and confidence
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.280]   at the level of neurobiological circuitry,
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.340]   and we are going to cover tools that will allow you
[00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.340]   to leverage your dopamine in order
[00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.560]   to have a maximum motivation to overcome sticking points,
[00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.240]   which include things like procrastination,
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.940]   but also by understanding the neural circuits
[00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.000]   in the brain and body that release and use dopamine,
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.900]   but more importantly,
[00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.800]   by understanding what are called dopamine dynamics,
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.300]   that is what gives rise to big peaks in dopamine
[00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.060]   or troughs in dopamine,
[00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.900]   or what's referred to as our baseline level of dopamine,
[00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.900]   which turns out to be our baseline levels of motivation
[00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.320]   and feelings of wellbeing.
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.100]   By understanding how those things relate to one another,
[00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.900]   I assure you that by the end of today's episode,
[00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.900]   you will be in a far better position
[00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.000]   to understand why you become amotivated,
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.420]   why you procrastinate,
[00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.100]   how to ensure motivation on an ongoing basis,
[00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.340]   and even how to leverage effort
[00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.620]   and the desire to become motivated
[00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.500]   as a way to do just that, to become more motivated.
[00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.900]   Today's discussion is not about psychology,
[00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.780]   although I will center around practical everyday examples
[00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.280]   and offer many, many tools
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.300]   that you can implement if you choose.
[00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.660]   Today's discussion is really about pulling apart
[00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.000]   these things that we call motivation, reward,
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   pleasure, procrastination,
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.600]   and understanding them in terms of their dopamine dynamics.
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.900]   So whether you've heard me or others
[00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.660]   talk about dopamine before,
[00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.640]   or whether or not today is your first exposure
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.280]   to the topic of dopamine,
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.080]   today's episode is really designed to give you
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.380]   the biological and practical knowledge
[00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.700]   so that you can leverage your dopamine circuitry
[00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:25.720]   and your dopamine levels,
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.880]   as well as tools to adjust dopamine circuitry and levels
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.820]   in order to optimize mental health,
[00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.860]   physical health, and performance.
[00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.460]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.140]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.160]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.620]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.000]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.060]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.800]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.780]   Our first sponsor is Helix Sleep.
[00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.980]   Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows
[00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.940]   that are the absolute highest quality.
[00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.940]   I've talked many times before on this and other podcasts
[00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.980]   about the critical role that sleep plays
[00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.260]   in allowing you to be awake and alert
[00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.020]   and have a good elevated mood throughout the day.
[00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.100]   Sleep is just fundamental to our mental health,
[00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.360]   physical health, and performance,
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.860]   and there's no replacing great sleep.
[00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.160]   A key thing we all need in order to get excellent sleep
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.420]   is to have an ideal sleep environment.
[00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.840]   Helix mattresses are designed for your unique sleep needs
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.140]   in order to ensure that you get
[00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.700]   the best possible night's sleep.
[00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.000]   So if you go to the Helix site
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.620]   and you take their very brief two or three-minute quiz,
[00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:26.960]   it will ask you questions such as,
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.620]   do you sleep on your side, your back, or your stomach?
[00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.480]   Do you tend to run hot or cold throughout the night?
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.240]   And they will match you to a mattress
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.320]   that's specific to your sleep needs.
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.820]   I matched to the Dusk mattress.
[00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:37.860]   That's the one that works for me.
[00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.780]   And since sleeping on the Dusk mattress,
[00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.420]   now for well over two years,
[00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.740]   I've been sleeping better than I ever have before.
[00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.240]   So if you go to their site, you take the quiz
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.460]   and you figure out what's the ideal mattress for you.
[00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.180]   Just go to helixsleep.com/huberman,
[00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.460]   take their two-minute sleep quiz,
[00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.300]   and they'll match you to a customized mattress,
[00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.380]   and you'll get up to $350 off any mattress order
[00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.500]   and two free pillows.
[00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.040]   Again, if interested, you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.040]   for up to $350 off and two free pillows.
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.840]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Whoop.
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.440]   Whoop is a fitness wearable device
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.580]   that tracks your daily activity and sleep,
[00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.780]   but also goes beyond that by providing real-time feedback
[00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.340]   on how to adjust your physical training and sleep schedule
[00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.100]   and other activities throughout your day
[00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.100]   in order to optimize your health.
[00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.180]   I've been working with Whoop on their Scientific Advisory
[00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.060]   Council to help advance Whoop's technology and mission
[00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.740]   of unlocking human performance,
[00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.100]   not just for athletes, but for everybody.
[00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.560]   As a Whoop user, I've experienced the health benefits
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.200]   of their technology firsthand.
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.500]   For instance, it tells me, of course,
[00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.200]   whether or not I had a good night's sleep
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.100]   or a poor night's sleep by giving me a sleep score.
[00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.100]   It tells me the percentage of rapid eye movement sleep
[00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.200]   to slow wave sleep.
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.220]   But Whoop also tells me, for instance,
[00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.740]   whether or not certain activities during my daytime,
[00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.500]   such as naps or training or training
[00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:48.900]   of a certain amount of intensity,
[00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.640]   how that's impacting my sleep and vice versa.
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:52.980]   If you're interested in trying Whoop,
[00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.420]   you can go to join.whoop.com/huberman.
[00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.900]   Again, that join.whoop.com/huberman today,
[00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.060]   and you'll get your first month free.
[00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.340]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Roca.
[00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.420]   Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.780]   that are uniquely tailored to the needs of athletes
[00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.020]   and everyday people.
[00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.020]   The company was founded by two all-American swimmers
[00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.740]   from Stanford, and everything about Roca eyeglasses
[00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.040]   and sunglasses were designed with the biology,
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.620]   the visual system in mind.
[00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.460]   I've spent a lifetime working on the biology
[00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:21.300]   of the visual system.
[00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.520]   And I can tell you that your visual system
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.660]   has to contend with an enormous number of challenges
[00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.560]   in order for you to be able to see clearly.
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.920]   Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses are designed
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.740]   such that when you go from one environment to the next,
[00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:32.920]   like a brightly lit environment
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.300]   to a less a brightly lit environment,
[00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:36.640]   you don't notice that transition.
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.300]   You always see with perfect clarity.
[00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.300]   Another terrific thing about Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.980]   is that many of the performance glasses out there
[00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.280]   that are designed for sport make people look like cyborgs,
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.920]   which if you want that, they do have those options,
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.920]   the cyborg options, as I call them.
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.140]   But they also have many options where the aesthetic
[00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:55.040]   is more of the sort that you would wear to dinner
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.620]   or to work or anywhere that you happen to be.
[00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.960]   If you'd like to try Roca eyeglasses or sunglasses,
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.320]   go to Roca, that's R-O-K-A dot com,
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.760]   and enter the code Huberman to save 20% off your first order.
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.080]   Again, that's Roca, R-O-K-A dot com,
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.400]   and enter the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.160]   The Huberman Lab Podcast is now partnered
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.380]   with Momentous Supplements.
[00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:14.720]   To find the supplements we discuss
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:15.920]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.560]   you can go to Live Momentous, spelled O-U-S,
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.120]   livemomentous.com/huberman.
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.500]   And I should just mention that the library
[00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.680]   of those supplements is constantly expanding.
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.080]   Again, that's livemomentous.com/huberman.
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.700]   Okay, let's talk about dopamine.
[00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:30.540]   What is dopamine?
[00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:33.380]   Dopamine is what's called a neuromodulator,
[00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:36.080]   which simply refers to the fact that it's a chemical
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.800]   that modulates or changes the electrical activity
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.080]   of other cells.
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.720]   And the cells I'm referring to are neurons.
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.600]   Neurons are just nerve cells.
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.000]   So you have a brain and a spinal cord,
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.980]   and the neurons in your brain and spinal cord
[00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:50.880]   connect to one another,
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:54.040]   and they connect to different areas of the body,
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.440]   including basically every organ of your body.
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:59.280]   And every organ of your body communicates back
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:00.960]   to your brain and spinal cord
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.400]   through direct or indirect pathways.
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.680]   For instance, you have neurons in your gut
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:09.120]   that sense what sorts of nutrients you've eaten or drink,
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.200]   and then send neural signals, electrical signals,
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.400]   up to the brain.
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.040]   And indeed, that whole process happens
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.420]   to be modulated by dopamine.
[00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:20.140]   Dopamine as a neuromodulator has the basic property
[00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:22.480]   of either ramping up, increasing,
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.900]   or decreasing the activity of other neurons.
[00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:26.340]   And that's done by adjusting things
[00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:28.340]   like electrical potentials and things of that sort
[00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:30.980]   that we really won't go into this episode,
[00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:32.800]   but that I promise to get into in detail
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.320]   in a future episode if you're interested
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.800]   in the biochemistry and biophysics of neurons
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.320]   and things of that sort.
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.640]   So we have this neuromodulator, dopamine,
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.840]   and we know that that neuromodulator can increase
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.580]   or decrease the activity of other neurons.
[00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:47.060]   So then we have to ask ourselves,
[00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:49.840]   where is dopamine released in the brain and body,
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:53.420]   and what specific types of neurons is it impacting?
[00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:55.600]   In other words, what specific types of functions
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:56.700]   does dopamine have?
[00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:59.260]   So there are basically five circuits within the brain
[00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.340]   that use dopamine as the primary neuromodulator,
[00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:05.480]   and those five circuits engage different
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:07.160]   but related functions.
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.080]   So I'm going to go through them one by one
[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:12.200]   relatively quickly, giving you a little bit of nomenclature
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.280]   and some sense of what each of those circuits looks like
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.680]   and what it does.
[00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:19.520]   The first circuit is the so-called nigrostriatal pathway.
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:20.600]   So in the back of the brain,
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.940]   there's an area called substantia nigra,
[00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:26.960]   so named because the neurons, they're actually very dark,
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.240]   they actually contain pigment.
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.120]   You'd be able to see this if I were to slice up a brain,
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:31.760]   you'd see two dark regions in the back.
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:32.820]   That's substantia nigra.
[00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:34.960]   Substantia nigra contains neurons
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:36.700]   that are chock-a-block full of dopamine,
[00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:38.000]   but they release that dopamine
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.900]   in a brain structure called the striatum.
[00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:42.280]   The striatum is involved in movement,
[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:44.100]   both the initiation of movements
[00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:45.740]   and the suppression of movements,
[00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:48.540]   in so-called GO, action, and NO-GO,
[00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:52.640]   suppress action pathways, a topic for a future podcast.
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.860]   The second brain circuit that uses
[00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:56.860]   and leverages dopamine to a great extent
[00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:58.980]   is the so-called mesolimbic pathway.
[00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:00.420]   Now, you'll also in a moment hear
[00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:02.500]   about the mesocortical pathway.
[00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.340]   So today I'm going to talk about these
[00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:06.100]   somewhat interchangeably at times,
[00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:07.600]   but where it's important for me
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.120]   to differentiate between them, I will do that.
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:13.160]   Both of these pathways initiate from a set of neurons
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.600]   in the so-called ventral tegmental area, or VTA.
[00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:18.640]   I will use that acronym, VTA.
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:22.060]   The VTA functions in close partnership
[00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:23.240]   with a different brain structure
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:25.720]   called the nucleus accumbens, or NA.
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.040]   I don't think I'll call it NA today.
[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.520]   I'll talk about VTA, ventral tegmental area,
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:31.420]   and I'll talk about nucleus accumbens.
[00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:32.680]   For sake of today's discussion,
[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:35.180]   you can lump those together if you want.
[00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:38.780]   Neurons in those areas project a bunch of different places,
[00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:40.440]   but in the mesolimbic pathway,
[00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.320]   those neurons are projecting to areas of the brain
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:43.400]   like the hypothalamus,
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.020]   which sits right above the roof of your mouth
[00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:48.040]   and is responsible for a lot of basic functions,
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:50.380]   things like maintaining your body temperature,
[00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:53.980]   for libido and the pursuit of sex,
[00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:57.900]   for hunger, for the generation of signals
[00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:02.220]   to the pituitary gland that caused the release of hormones
[00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:04.460]   and other things into the bloodstream.
[00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:05.320]   So the connections,
[00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:07.820]   which I sometimes refer to as projections,
[00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:10.900]   from the neurons in the VTA and nucleus accumbens
[00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:13.560]   to the hypothalamus are basically using dopamine
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.720]   to modulate the output of a lot of different things
[00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:18.280]   that happen in this hypothalamus
[00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:19.920]   that controls a lot of,
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.680]   we could call them primitive functions,
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:24.280]   but they're really basic functions for survival.
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:27.760]   Now, the other pathway out of the VTA and nucleus accumbens
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:28.780]   is to the cortex.
[00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:31.040]   That's why it's called mesocortical pathway.
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.120]   So this is a very different pathway
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.800]   out of the VTA and nucleus accumbens
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.600]   than the one I just described a moment ago.
[00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:37.880]   The pathway I'm talking about now,
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:39.500]   the mesocortical pathway,
[00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:41.240]   projects to the prefrontal cortex,
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.840]   which is a structure that many of you have perhaps heard of,
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:45.560]   but even if you haven't, it's important to know
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:49.520]   this is an area that resides right behind your forehead
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:52.200]   and that in humans compared to other species
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.760]   is greatly expanded in terms of its size
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:55.980]   and complexity of function.
[00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:57.120]   So it's involved in everything
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:59.760]   from planning and executing of action
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.960]   to making good or bad decisions, depending on context.
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:05.680]   In fact, one of the primary functions of prefrontal cortex
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:07.360]   is to really understand context,
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:09.560]   whether or not, for instance, you are alone in your room
[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:11.880]   where certain behaviors are appropriate,
[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.560]   whether or not you are at work
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:15.820]   where other behaviors are appropriate,
[00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:18.280]   understanding what the context is
[00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:20.620]   and therefore what sorts of actions
[00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:23.200]   need to be generated and suppressed.
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:25.500]   In fact, a guest on the Huberman Lab podcast,
[00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:28.000]   and this is a guest whose episode hasn't aired yet,
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.400]   described this beautifully, he's a neurosurgeon,
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:33.680]   and he said, "The way to think about the prefrontal cortex
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:36.960]   is it's basically an area of the brain that says shh,
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:40.460]   or no, not now, to other brain regions
[00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:41.680]   in order to suppress action."
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:43.240]   And we know this because people that have damage
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:45.120]   to the prefrontal cortex
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:48.280]   often can't suppress their impulses.
[00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:51.680]   So the pathway from VTA and nucleus accumbens
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:53.960]   to the prefrontal cortex is absolutely critical
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:54.880]   for today's discussion
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:57.080]   because we are largely going to be discussing
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:00.880]   motivation, drive, pursuit, procrastination,
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:03.060]   and all sorts of things that have to do with
[00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:05.440]   our feelings about context,
[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:06.840]   whether or not we want to do something or not,
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:08.840]   whether or not we feel we should or we shouldn't,
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:10.880]   whether or not we feel we failed the last time
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:13.120]   or there's a high probability of success the next time.
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:15.480]   Prefrontal cortex does many, many things,
[00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:17.880]   but when thinking about dopamine's role
[00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:18.980]   in the prefrontal cortex,
[00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:22.160]   that is when thinking about this mesocortical pathway,
[00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:25.440]   we really want to think about how dopamine is activating
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:28.640]   or changing our propensity to do certain things
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:29.920]   and get us into action
[00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:32.960]   or prevent us from doing certain things and prevent action.
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:35.760]   So basically you can think about the mesocortical pathway
[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:38.680]   as a circuit that really governs all of the major choices
[00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:39.920]   that you're going to make in life
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:42.760]   about what to do and what not to do toward your goals
[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:45.240]   and away from the things that you want to avoid.
[00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:47.720]   Now, the fourth dopamine pathway in the brain
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:50.840]   is the so-called tuberoinfundibular pathway.
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:53.680]   And this is not one we're going to focus on too much today.
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:55.520]   This is a pathway that relates to connections
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:57.620]   between the brain and your pituitary gland.
[00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:00.560]   Your pituitary gland being that gland that's,
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:01.480]   as I mentioned a moment ago,
[00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.600]   is also receiving input from the hypothalamus
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:06.420]   and is releasing a bunch of hormones into your bloodstream.
[00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:07.680]   Things like luteinizing hormone,
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:09.740]   follicle stimulating hormone,
[00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:12.280]   things like melanocortin hormone.
[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:13.960]   These are hormones that are impacting everything
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:15.880]   from the function of the ovary in females
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:18.200]   to the function of the testes in males.
[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:21.880]   It's governing things like cortisol release under stress,
[00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:24.240]   thyroid hormone, meaning it's regulating
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:26.940]   thyroid hormone release, and on and on.
[00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:29.380]   Dopamine has a very powerful impact
[00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:32.320]   on the output of the pituitary.
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.680]   So again, that's probably a topic for a future episode,
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:37.540]   but it's important in reviewing the different brain circuits
[00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:39.620]   that use dopamine as a neuromodulator
[00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:40.920]   that I mentioned that one.
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:42.640]   Then there's a fifth one.
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:44.740]   And this fifth one is not often discussed.
[00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:47.520]   And again, won't be the main topic of today's discussion,
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:49.760]   but for thoroughness and for clarity,
[00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:51.480]   it's important that we mention it.
[00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:53.680]   This is the circuit within your retina.
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:57.300]   That is the pie crust-like lining of neural tissue
[00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:58.200]   on the back of your eye.
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:00.880]   Because remember, your eye is actually part of your brain
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:03.020]   that got extruded from your brain during development.
[00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:05.360]   You know, those two eyes that you see in the mirror
[00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:07.120]   and that you see in other people
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:10.200]   are actually two pieces of central nervous system.
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:11.500]   And within the retina,
[00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:14.280]   which is the neural portion of the eye,
[00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:16.260]   within the neural retina,
[00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.460]   dopamine is responsible for adapting
[00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:20.640]   to different light conditions
[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:23.120]   so that you can see clearly both in the evening
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:25.400]   and when it gets darker, you can still see a bit.
[00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:27.320]   And in the morning, when it's very bright,
[00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:29.400]   you don't really have to make adjustments
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:31.280]   to your visual system in order to see clearly.
[00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:32.820]   Your visual system does it for you.
[00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:34.400]   And one of the ways that it does that
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.920]   is through the neuromodulator dopamine.
[00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:38.840]   So today we are not going to discuss
[00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:40.260]   the retinal dopamine pathways
[00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.480]   or the tuber infundibular dopamine pathways.
[00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:44.200]   And we won't really talk so much
[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:45.580]   about the nigrostriatal pathway.
[00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:46.720]   I'll say one more thing about it
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.460]   and then I'll leave it alone.
[00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:50.960]   We are going to talk about the mesocortical pathway
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:53.200]   and we might touch on the mesolimbic pathway
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.100]   a little bit as well.
[00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:55.660]   So today we're mostly going to talk
[00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:58.620]   about mesocortical circuitry and function
[00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:01.460]   and dopamine within the mesocortical circuit.
[00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:03.420]   And the reason that we're doing that
[00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:05.900]   is that today's discussion is really about motivation,
[00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:08.280]   procrastination, goal setting, and pursuit.
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:10.940]   It's very important to understand
[00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:14.560]   that neither dopamine nor the mesocortical circuit
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:17.940]   cares about any specific goal or pursuit.
[00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:20.740]   This is a circuit that uses dopamine
[00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:23.540]   in order to pursue anything.
[00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:26.220]   Now, of course, some people have a greater propensity
[00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:30.120]   to pursue things like work or goals in athletics
[00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:32.580]   or relationships or a combination of those.
[00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:34.920]   Other people, unfortunately, have a greater propensity
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:37.060]   to pursue things like drugs of abuse.
[00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:37.980]   What are drugs of abuse?
[00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:40.300]   Drugs of abuse tend to be drugs
[00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:41.900]   that increase levels of dopamine
[00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:45.380]   to the extent that other types of pursuits in life
[00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:48.020]   that are adaptive for us, like work, relationship, school,
[00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:49.740]   et cetera, become irrelevant.
[00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:53.260]   In fact, the definition of addiction that I use
[00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:56.940]   and that I believe really matches the neurobiology very well
[00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:59.620]   is that addiction is a progressive narrowing
[00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:01.320]   of the things that bring us pleasure.
[00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:04.480]   Healthy functioning of the mesocortical pathway, however,
[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:07.480]   allows us to toggle or switch back and forth
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:09.900]   between different types of pursuits
[00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:12.100]   of all the sorts that I've mentioned earlier.
[00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:15.500]   So if we can understand how that mesocortical pathway works
[00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:17.500]   just a little bit, in particular,
[00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:20.580]   when dopamine is released and when it's not released,
[00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:22.840]   what dopamine does when it's released
[00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:25.420]   to our sense of motivation and drive,
[00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:27.040]   and if we can understand a little bit
[00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:29.980]   about how our recent dopamine history,
[00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:32.220]   that is, whether or not there is dopamine
[00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:34.660]   in our system already,
[00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:36.920]   dictates whether or not we are going to feel motivated
[00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:40.980]   in the next five, 10, 15 minutes, hours, days, and weeks.
[00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:42.700]   That is all very easy to understand.
[00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:45.340]   I promise I'll explain it to you in a simple way,
[00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:47.380]   but I want you to get a circuit into your mind.
[00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:49.100]   I want you to envision that there are these neurons,
[00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:52.380]   little nerve cells in the VTA and nucleus accumbens.
[00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:54.020]   Those neurons make dopamine.
[00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:56.300]   They send their projections that we call axons,
[00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:57.240]   which are like little wires,
[00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:00.420]   and they can release dopamine into the prefrontal cortex.
[00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:02.460]   And now you already know,
[00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:03.820]   because you learned it a few minutes ago,
[00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:06.340]   that the prefrontal cortex then can ensure
[00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:07.940]   that certain behaviors take place
[00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:10.140]   and other behaviors do not take place,
[00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:14.020]   that shh or quieting that we talked about earlier.
[00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:15.260]   With that in mind,
[00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:18.860]   let's now take a look at how dopamine is released,
[00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:21.100]   and let's keep two things in mind.
[00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:23.240]   There are peaks in dopamine.
[00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:25.560]   That is, dopamine is released into the frontal cortex,
[00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:26.640]   where it has these effects
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:29.460]   of activating or suppressing action.
[00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:32.340]   And we can think of those as peaks in dopamine.
[00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:34.900]   So if I call it a spike,
[00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:37.080]   that means an increase and then a decrease.
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:40.300]   If I call it a peak, it's an increase and then a decrease.
[00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:42.960]   There can also be troughs in dopamine.
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:43.920]   What do I mean by that?
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:46.240]   Well, we have peaks in dopamine,
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:49.320]   and that peak in dopamine can rise up
[00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:52.280]   and then go back to what we call baseline,
[00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:54.380]   or there can be a trough.
[00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:56.180]   It can go below baseline.
[00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:59.160]   So the two key things to understand about dopamine
[00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:01.000]   is that we have dopamine peaks
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.380]   that are triggered by certain behaviors,
[00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:07.900]   certain compounds, drugs, or substances, food, et cetera,
[00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:10.560]   and that we have a dopamine baseline.
[00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:14.240]   Our dopamine baseline is our reservoir of dopamine.
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:18.100]   It's how full or empty our dopamine pool is.
[00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:21.360]   And that dopamine pool is the pool of dopamine that we use
[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:23.700]   in order to create those dopamine peaks.
[00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:25.400]   And when those peaks come down,
[00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:26.860]   sometimes they go back to baseline,
[00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:29.540]   and sometimes they go to lower than baseline,
[00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:31.060]   which we call the trough.
[00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:33.580]   If any of this seems confusing,
[00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:36.240]   I want you just to imagine a wave pool.
[00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:38.300]   This is an analogy that was given to me
[00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:39.800]   by one of our podcast guests,
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:42.800]   which is Dr. Kyle Gillette, who's an obesity specialist
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:44.260]   and works on a number of things
[00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:45.880]   related to endocrine hormone function,
[00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:48.920]   including testosterone, estrogen in both men and women.
[00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:51.720]   Want to check out his episodes on hormone health.
[00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:53.600]   They're fascinating and actionable,
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:55.060]   and he's a tremendous wealth of knowledge.
[00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:58.400]   And he has this analogy for how dopamine works
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:00.060]   in our brain and body.
[00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:02.500]   And that analogy is this notion of a wave pool.
[00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:03.580]   If you've ever seen a wave pool,
[00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:06.660]   it's basically a concrete pool,
[00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:09.980]   and there are waves within it, okay, duh.
[00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:12.460]   Those waves can be of different heights,
[00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:14.220]   so they can be little ripples,
[00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:16.300]   and we can think of those as little mini peaks,
[00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:17.860]   or they can be big waves.
[00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:20.240]   They can be really big crashing waves.
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:23.840]   If the height of those waves
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:28.420]   and the frequency of those waves is very, very large,
[00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:29.940]   some of that water,
[00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:32.740]   which here I'm using as an analogy to dopamine,
[00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:36.740]   can slosh out of the wave pool and the baseline drops.
[00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:40.100]   However, if those peaks are small enough
[00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:42.360]   or they are seldom enough,
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:45.660]   well then the baseline, that is the water level in that pool,
[00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:47.900]   stays more or less constant.
[00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:49.640]   I think this is an excellent analogy
[00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:52.480]   for how dopamine works in the mesocortical pathway
[00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:54.560]   as it relates to motivation and pursuit
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:56.020]   and all those sorts of things,
[00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:57.480]   because we really need to think about
[00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:00.700]   how the peaks and the baseline relate to one another.
[00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:02.260]   And this is very important.
[00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:04.440]   The peaks and the baseline are not independent
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:06.720]   of one another, they relate to one another.
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.740]   So now you have in your mind a wave pool,
[00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:12.000]   and just understand that if you get a great big huge wave,
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.840]   maybe one of them, it will crash out,
[00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:16.000]   and some of that water will splash out,
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.400]   the baseline will go down a little bit.
[00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:20.200]   But if you get big peak after big peak after big peak,
[00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:21.720]   pretty soon you're going to empty that pool.
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:23.360]   Whereas if you have smaller waves
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:25.100]   or less frequent big waves,
[00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:28.720]   well then the baseline will stay relatively constant.
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:32.220]   So let's think about dopamine peaks and baselines.
[00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:36.080]   And let's remember that for every peak, there's a trough.
[00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:36.920]   What do I mean by that?
[00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:38.920]   Well, when you have a wave,
[00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:41.060]   you also have the bottom of the wave.
[00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:42.640]   When you have a mountain,
[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:45.160]   you have the bottom of the mountain.
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:49.180]   When we think about dopamine peaks and dopamine baselines,
[00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:52.900]   we have to include that trough because that trough,
[00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:57.680]   that is the level of dopamine below baseline,
[00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:00.400]   really dictates whether or not you are going to feel
[00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:02.800]   motivated to pursue something or not.
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:04.520]   So I'm going to give you a visual in your mind.
[00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:07.960]   The visual in your mind is an increase in dopamine
[00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:11.400]   that's triggered by your desire for something.
[00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:13.380]   And really it could be your desire for anything.
[00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:15.280]   If you're hungry and you're thinking about,
[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:18.200]   I really want a sandwich, I really want to think,
[00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:19.440]   what sandwich would I want right now?
[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:22.000]   A really nice roast beef sandwich on sourdough
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.760]   with a slice of Swiss tomatoes, slice of pickle.
[00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:26.800]   Here I'm describing the sandwich that I would want.
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:29.500]   So if you're hungry and you're thinking about that,
[00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:31.840]   dopamine starts rising.
[00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:33.980]   This is crucially important to understand.
[00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:37.520]   Dopamine is not just released when we get the reward,
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:39.040]   when we get the thing that we're pursuing.
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:43.640]   Dopamine is released in anticipation of what we want.
[00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:49.560]   That increase in dopamine is by no happenstance, no mistake,
[00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:54.640]   relates also to our propensity and desire to move.
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:56.600]   Remember earlier I told you there's a separate circuit
[00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:59.380]   of dopamine that triggers movement
[00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:02.520]   and that when it's depleted is causing things
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:04.860]   like deficits and movement related to Parkinson's
[00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:06.340]   or other movement disorders?
[00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:08.860]   Well, that's not pure coincidence.
[00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:11.660]   That's because desire and the need to move
[00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:13.940]   in order to pursue and reach goals
[00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:16.620]   are one in the same process.
[00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:20.340]   So if I desire a sandwich or I desire a cup of coffee
[00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:22.400]   or I desire some water when I'm thirsty,
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:24.020]   there's an increase in dopamine
[00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:27.140]   that we could call a little mini peak in dopamine.
[00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:28.860]   But then here's the key thing.
[00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:32.760]   Very soon after I realize my desire for something,
[00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:36.980]   that peak that was caused by the desire
[00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:40.120]   comes down and drops below baseline,
[00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:43.320]   below the level of dopamine that it was prior
[00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:45.340]   to even thinking about the sandwich or the coffee
[00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:46.540]   or the glass of water.
[00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:50.020]   And it's that drop below baseline
[00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:54.140]   that triggers my desire to go out and find that sandwich,
[00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:57.180]   that coffee, that water, or that blank.
[00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:59.340]   Insert whatever it is that you happen to desire,
[00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:03.580]   action or substance of any kind or person, et cetera.
[00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:06.700]   So that drop below baseline is fundamental
[00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:07.620]   to the whole process.
[00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:10.140]   And that drop below baseline was triggered
[00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:11.800]   by the preceding peak.
[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:13.580]   So let's say that I desire a sandwich,
[00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:15.140]   there's an increase in dopamine.
[00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:17.940]   Then very quickly it comes down below baseline
[00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:19.020]   just a little bit.
[00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:20.220]   Now I'm in pursuit of the sandwich.
[00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:22.300]   I'm looking for where I can get that sandwich.
[00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:24.220]   I can order it perhaps to be delivered.
[00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:25.460]   I can go out and find it.
[00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:29.100]   Now is the stage in which I have to think about
[00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:31.340]   what are the different stimuli,
[00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:33.340]   that is the things in my environment that signal
[00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:36.260]   whether or not I'm likely to get that sandwich or not.
[00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:38.340]   And so, for instance, if I were to go to my phone
[00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:40.940]   and order food on a nap or walk down the street
[00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:43.380]   and see the sign for a deli,
[00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:48.380]   that's a cue that I'm likely to relieve that drop
[00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:51.420]   in dopamine and get not just back to baseline,
[00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:53.180]   but then I'll get a peak in dopamine.
[00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:54.420]   And indeed that's what happens.
[00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:57.780]   If I find that deli, I go into the deli,
[00:23:57.780 --> 00:23:59.700]   they're open, they're making the sandwich that I want,
[00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:02.340]   they make my sandwich and great, I get that sandwich.
[00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:03.960]   And that sandwich will have some degree
[00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:06.460]   of inherent reward to it.
[00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:09.740]   Some degree of my liking it or not liking it.
[00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:10.740]   So let's say I like it.
[00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:12.160]   It's not the best sandwich I've ever had,
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:15.860]   but all I'm doing is comparing my desire for that sandwich
[00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:18.440]   to the sandwich that I actually got and ate.
[00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:21.940]   And chances are it's going to relieve that craving,
[00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:23.940]   meaning it will take that dopamine
[00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:27.100]   that had fallen below baseline, up, up, back to baseline.
[00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:28.540]   And if I like the sandwich,
[00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:31.400]   it's going to indeed increase that dopamine,
[00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:32.840]   again, to another peak.
[00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:35.500]   Now, if I love the sandwich,
[00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:36.820]   like it's the most delicious thing
[00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:38.680]   that I've ever tasted in my entire life,
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:41.680]   well then I'll get a big peak in dopamine
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:43.900]   when I consume that reward.
[00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:46.500]   However, chances are the sandwich is more or less
[00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:48.620]   as I expect it to be, which is pretty good.
[00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:50.100]   I'll eat it and I'm fine.
[00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:51.300]   What do I mean by fine?
[00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:53.760]   Well, there's a concept called reward prediction error.
[00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:57.420]   Reward prediction error says that the dopamine
[00:24:57.420 --> 00:24:59.280]   that it has experienced, that is,
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:02.000]   that's released from the VTA and nucleus accumbens,
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.320]   is going to be of a certain value.
[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:07.480]   And that value is going to be compared
[00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:09.220]   to the desire and expectation
[00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:11.280]   of what I thought I was going to get.
[00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:13.000]   So if you take what you actually got
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.320]   minus what you expected, that's reward prediction error.
[00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:19.520]   So if the sandwich is basically what I expected to get, fine.
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:22.520]   Dopamine comes down basically to a baseline level
[00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:23.600]   that's pretty standard for me
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:25.400]   and is basically the baseline level I had
[00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:28.200]   before I ever thought about the sandwich at all.
[00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:30.320]   If the sandwich completely surprises me
[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:33.640]   and is completely amazing, just an amazing sandwich,
[00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:36.400]   well then the level of dopamine that I experienced
[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:39.520]   when I consumed that sandwich is going to be even greater
[00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:43.060]   and it's going to be that minus what I expected.
[00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:45.840]   So there it's a bigger reward prediction error
[00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:50.480]   in the direction of higher peak by consuming the sandwich.
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:52.320]   And then of course, there's the other possibility,
[00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:54.720]   which is the deli's closed
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:57.960]   or the sandwich they make me is lousy or doesn't taste good
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:01.160]   or something happened in the consuming of that sandwich
[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:03.240]   that just makes it a bad experience.
[00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:05.960]   In which case, if we take that reward experienced
[00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:10.880]   minus reward predicted from the initial craving,
[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:13.440]   well then it's going to be less than what I expected
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:16.260]   and therefore the baseline drops below
[00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:20.000]   where it was prior to even desiring the sandwich.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.040]   Okay, so all of this might seem a little bit complicated
[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:23.500]   but it's all very simple.
[00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:26.080]   Desire for things increases dopamine,
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:29.080]   but then our level of dopamine drops below baseline
[00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:31.140]   and it's that drop below baseline
[00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:32.840]   that triggers the motivation
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:35.540]   to bring that dopamine level back up
[00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:37.520]   by going and pursuing the thing
[00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:40.220]   that you wanted in the first place.
[00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:42.200]   Now, of course, as this is happening,
[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:44.200]   you're not conscious of your dopamine levels,
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:48.520]   you experience this as context dependent craving and pursuit
[00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:49.880]   because remember the prefrontal cortex
[00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:53.560]   is involved in context setting and craving and pursuit
[00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:55.960]   because it relates to action and movement,
[00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:59.560]   which is one of the general features of the dopamine system.
[00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:00.400]   So you can start to see
[00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:02.680]   how this is a beautifully designed system
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:05.480]   and you can also see how it's a perfect system
[00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:10.040]   for desire and pursuit of anything, not just sandwiches
[00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:11.960]   as I'm giving you in this somewhat trivial
[00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:14.680]   but everyday and therefore applicable example.
[00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:17.920]   So just by understanding reward prediction error
[00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:19.660]   and especially by understanding
[00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:22.400]   that a craving triggers a peak in dopamine
[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:23.780]   that makes you motivated
[00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:26.480]   but then drops your level of dopamine below baseline
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:29.040]   which makes you even more motivated,
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:32.160]   you are already halfway through the conceptual aspect
[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:34.920]   of today's podcast because if you can understand that,
[00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:37.360]   you will understand why, for instance,
[00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:39.020]   when you initially want something
[00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:40.960]   or you think you want something,
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:45.240]   it puts you into motion but then pretty quickly,
[00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:48.800]   you're starting to feel the pain of not having that
[00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:50.580]   and that is also contributing
[00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:52.520]   to your desire to pursue that thing.
[00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:55.100]   This is a subtle effect but if you watch for it,
[00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:58.360]   you'll start to see it or experience it within yourself.
[00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:00.440]   Your craving for things is not just about
[00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:02.600]   craving for those things per se,
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:05.600]   it's also a desire to relieve the pain
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:07.400]   of not having those things.
[00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:09.520]   And if you can internalize that
[00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:11.640]   and start to develop an awareness around it,
[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:13.640]   you will be in an amazing position
[00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:16.840]   to leverage all sorts of aspects of the dopamine system
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:18.440]   in order to increase your motivation
[00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:20.600]   especially when things get really hard
[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:23.120]   or when you have the propensity to procrastinate
[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:24.320]   which is something that we'll get into
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:26.200]   a little bit later in the podcast.
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:27.600]   I'd like to take a quick break
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:30.640]   and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:33.080]   Athletic Greens now called AG1
[00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:35.460]   is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:38.360]   that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.
[00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:41.040]   I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:43.260]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:44.840]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:46.920]   and the reason I still take Athletic Greens
[00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:48.920]   once or usually twice a day
[00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:52.520]   is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health.
[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:53.600]   Our gut is very important,
[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:56.160]   it's populated by gut microbiota
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:57.920]   that communicate with the brain, the immune system
[00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:00.320]   and basically all the biological systems of our body
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:03.960]   to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.
[00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:07.000]   And those probiotics in Athletic Greens are optimal
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.660]   and vital for microbiota health.
[00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:12.240]   In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number of adaptogens,
[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:13.640]   vitamins and minerals that make sure
[00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:16.580]   that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met
[00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:18.480]   and it tastes great.
[00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:19.920]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:23.320]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:25.280]   and they'll give you five free travel packs
[00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:27.600]   that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens
[00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:30.180]   while you're on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera
[00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:33.600]   and they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:36.280]   Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:37.640]   to get the five free travel packs
[00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:40.580]   and the year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:43.200]   Now I'd like to talk about the dynamics of dopamine release
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:45.400]   with a little bit more detail.
[00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:47.160]   And this is something I've never covered
[00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:50.400]   on any social media post or on any podcast,
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:53.300]   either this one or as a guest on other podcasts,
[00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:55.200]   because on the face of it,
[00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:56.680]   it might seem a little too detailed,
[00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:57.860]   like why is he telling me all this?
[00:29:57.860 --> 00:30:00.160]   Isn't it just enough to know that there are peaks and troughs
[00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:02.080]   and baselines in dopamine?
[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:04.880]   Well, it turns out that if you can understand
[00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:08.080]   what that peak and trough are really about,
[00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:09.760]   in other words, what's really happening
[00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:12.000]   when we zoom in on that peak and trough,
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.280]   you'll be in an amazing position to overcome procrastination
[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:19.980]   and essentially pursue any goals in an ongoing basis.
[00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:21.960]   So I'm very excited to share this information with you
[00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:25.460]   because I do think that it has tremendous actionable power.
[00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:27.920]   What I'm about to describe relates
[00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:30.000]   to a number of different findings that have been made,
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.460]   mostly over the last five to 10 years,
[00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:33.880]   although to be quite direct,
[00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:35.560]   mostly within the last five years.
[00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:38.720]   And it has to do with the fact that the peak and trough
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:40.520]   and baseline that I talked about a moment ago
[00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:42.680]   that are associated with craving,
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:44.880]   they look like a peak followed by a trough,
[00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:46.300]   followed by a return to baseline,
[00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:48.300]   and maybe another peak if you get the reward
[00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:50.120]   or a drop below baseline if you don't
[00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:52.320]   or you don't like what you got.
[00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:55.960]   But if we were to zoom in on that peak and the reward,
[00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:58.320]   in other words, really zoom in on the whole process
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:00.880]   and start thinking about the circuitry,
[00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:03.280]   that is the neurons and VTA and nucleus accumbens
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:05.400]   and how it relates to the frontal cortex
[00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:07.040]   in a bit more detail,
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:10.560]   what we discover is nothing short of amazing.
[00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:14.500]   What we discover is that whenever we're pursuing something,
[00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:16.440]   we are always looking for cues
[00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:19.640]   as to whether or not we are on the right path
[00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:20.920]   to achieve that thing.
[00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:23.260]   And we are also setting a mindset
[00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:26.360]   or a context within our brains
[00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:29.120]   as to whether or not we are confident or pessimistic
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:30.760]   as to whether or not we're going to achieve that thing.
[00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:33.340]   Now, this is vitally important for anyone out there
[00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:35.840]   who finds it hard to get motivated and stay motivated.
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:37.720]   It's also vitally important for anyone
[00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:39.860]   who's psychologically minded in any way.
[00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:41.160]   You don't have to be a psychologist,
[00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:43.200]   but psychologically minded in any way
[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:46.760]   and wonders why is it that some people are just so motivated
[00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:49.520]   and other people have such trouble with motivation?
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:51.900]   Why is it that some people require perfect conditions
[00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:53.900]   in order to achieve things
[00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:57.300]   and other people just seem to manage
[00:31:57.300 --> 00:31:58.720]   to pursue things no matter what?
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:01.360]   It also relates to the fact that some of us
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:03.880]   are very good at achieving our goals in one context
[00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:05.540]   and not so much in another.
[00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:08.240]   So here's what you need to understand.
[00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:10.580]   I'll stay with the example of the roast beef sandwich
[00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:12.300]   just because we already have that in mind,
[00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:14.320]   but you can replace roast beef sandwich
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:15.820]   with essentially any goal.
[00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:23.000]   The cue that we're going to likely get what we want.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.680]   So for instance, the sign that there's a deli on the corner
[00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:29.800]   or that I opened my phone and that there's an app
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:32.040]   that represents a restaurant
[00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:34.160]   that sells the particular sandwich that I like.
[00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:36.560]   That cue, as I mentioned before, increases dopamine.
[00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:38.040]   You see that and you're like, oh, okay.
[00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:40.300]   And subconsciously, there's already a signal
[00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:42.000]   that's initiated by that dopamine
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.620]   that I'm on the right path.
[00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:48.320]   Then as I mentioned, dopamine drops below baseline.
[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:52.000]   That's further contributing to my desire
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.960]   to go pursue that sandwich,
[00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:56.160]   either with my thumbs on my phone through the app
[00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:57.940]   or with my feet and walking to the deli,
[00:32:57.940 --> 00:32:59.440]   standing in line and so forth.
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:02.400]   Then as I mentioned before,
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:06.720]   there is a peak in dopamine of varying height,
[00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:09.840]   depending on how satisfying I find the reward to be
[00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:14.660]   when I actually get that sandwich, get that goal.
[00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:18.460]   Now keep in mind, there is some time delay between the cue,
[00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:23.700]   the app, the deli, et cetera, and when I get my sandwich.
[00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:27.200]   That gap is going to be different for different things.
[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:29.280]   So in pursuing a four-year degree,
[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:31.440]   it's going to be four years if the diploma is your goal.
[00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:33.460]   If it's an exam you're studying for,
[00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:34.780]   it might be a week long.
[00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:37.780]   And there will be many other signals
[00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:41.160]   in between that initial cue that,
[00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:44.320]   hey, the reward likely lies down this path,
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:49.280]   in this textbook, on this dating app, or at that deli.
[00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:51.360]   There are many other cues.
[00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:53.220]   Those cues come in subconsciously
[00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:56.440]   and involve everything from how long the line is at the deli
[00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:59.560]   to whether or not you're seeing the types of people
[00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:01.080]   on a dating app that you'd like to see,
[00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:02.760]   whether or not they're responding to you,
[00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:05.160]   whether or not someone's texting you back or not.
[00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:08.340]   All of those cues are integrated
[00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:12.040]   and adjusting your baseline level of dopamine all the time
[00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:14.500]   as you go to pursue that goal.
[00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:16.420]   So what the dopamine system does
[00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:18.500]   is it doesn't just compare the height of the peak
[00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:19.900]   at the beginning, right?
[00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:21.920]   I desire that to the reward that you got.
[00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:23.220]   We talked about reward prediction error.
[00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:26.880]   That's the kind of first grade version
[00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:28.400]   of reward prediction error.
[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:30.000]   It's also taking into account
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.460]   all the things that happen in between.
[00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:35.240]   And all of that is serving as a cue
[00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:36.580]   for the eventual reward.
[00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:37.880]   And all of that is funneling
[00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:39.940]   into what we call reward prediction error.
[00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:43.880]   In other words, the dopamine system is very good
[00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:47.580]   at subconsciously parsing what are the things that happen
[00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:50.120]   between wanting and getting.
[00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:52.680]   And that's part of the learning that dopamine achieves.
[00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:54.520]   And indeed there are specialized circuits
[00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:56.780]   from the VTA and nucleus accumbens
[00:34:56.780 --> 00:35:00.400]   that are involved in just the learning
[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:02.960]   of how we achieve or don't achieve
[00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:05.520]   specific types of rewards that we desire.
[00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:07.800]   So this is called reward contingent learning
[00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:09.540]   because it's learning the contingencies
[00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:11.580]   of what led up to a reward
[00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:13.620]   or what didn't lead up to a reward.
[00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:17.420]   At the same time, end in parallel,
[00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:19.920]   there's an ongoing release of dopamine
[00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:20.800]   in the background.
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:22.800]   And that ongoing release of dopamine
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:24.760]   that has nothing to do with learning
[00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:26.640]   is really just sort of a propeller
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:28.620]   that's driving us in the direction
[00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:31.080]   of whatever it is that we're trying to pursue.
[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:32.560]   So I realize for some of you,
[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:33.980]   this might seem like unnecessary
[00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:37.000]   or perhaps even an overwhelming amount of detail,
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.160]   but it's actually quite simple.
[00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:41.520]   Your brain is trying to figure out
[00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:44.880]   what happened prior to getting or not getting a reward.
[00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:46.240]   And it's comparing what you wanted
[00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:47.540]   compared to what you got.
[00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:51.600]   At the same time, the dopamine system
[00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:53.640]   initiates a motivation signal
[00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:57.440]   that takes you through that entire round of pursuit.
[00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:59.720]   And those three things,
[00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:02.820]   there's the stimulus, the desire, the I want that.
[00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:05.280]   That's the first thing that leads to that peak.
[00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:07.240]   The peak drops a little bit below baseline
[00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:08.640]   and it triggers motivation.
[00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:10.800]   The motivation is the second thing.
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:13.720]   The motivation is dopamine release also,
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:16.480]   but from a separate set of neurons within this circuit
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:18.320]   driving you forward.
[00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:21.120]   And the entire time that it's driving you forward,
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:23.720]   it's paying attention to what's there along the way,
[00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:25.760]   even if you don't realize it consciously.
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:27.320]   And then there's the reward itself
[00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:28.600]   or the lack of reward itself.
[00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:32.360]   So those three components, the learning contingency,
[00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:35.560]   which has to do with the stimulus and the reward
[00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:37.440]   and everything that happens in between
[00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:40.380]   and the propeller nature of dopamine,
[00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:41.640]   as I'm referring to it,
[00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:45.060]   those all combine into a total learning
[00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:47.320]   so that after you get the sandwich
[00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:48.720]   or after you finish the exam,
[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:50.060]   or after you go out on a date,
[00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:53.360]   or after you do anything that you desire to do,
[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:56.080]   that system that originates in the VTA
[00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:58.840]   and nucleus accumbens and goes up to your cortex,
[00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:00.300]   it learned.
[00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:01.680]   It learned many things.
[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:04.240]   It learned the contingency between stimulus
[00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:06.240]   and desire, motivation,
[00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:08.000]   and whether or not you succeeded or not.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.480]   It's basically a scoreboard for how you did
[00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:13.760]   given what just happened.
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:15.600]   So actually it's all very simple.
[00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:17.640]   In fact, if you can understand
[00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:19.940]   even just half of what I just said,
[00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:22.040]   you are now in a far better position
[00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:24.200]   to understand everything from addiction
[00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:26.720]   to motivation to procrastination.
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:28.740]   And it will make sense of all the tools
[00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:30.280]   that I'm going to talk about next,
[00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:33.520]   which will allow you to overcome procrastination points,
[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:35.600]   to overcome deficits and motivation,
[00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:39.000]   and indeed to reset your motivation in an ongoing way
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.600]   so that you can reach your goals.
[00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:42.960]   Okay, so let's take everything that I just told you
[00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:44.360]   and set it aside.
[00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:46.080]   It's still important, but let's just set it aside.
[00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:47.720]   You don't have to think about any of those details
[00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:49.760]   or names or anything.
[00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:51.640]   Let's just think about addiction
[00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:55.900]   because in biology and in psychology, frankly,
[00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:59.300]   it really often pays to think about the extremes first
[00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:02.200]   and then work our way towards more typical circumstances.
[00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:03.220]   And with that said,
[00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:05.680]   addiction unfortunately is very common nowadays.
[00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:07.180]   I just heard a statistic, in fact,
[00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:11.800]   that there is an 80% increase
[00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:15.480]   in alcohol use disorder among women in the last 30 years.
[00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:17.820]   I talked a little bit about this in the episode
[00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:20.140]   that I did about alcohol and health.
[00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:21.040]   Again, I want to be very clear.
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:23.640]   I'm not somebody that is completely against alcohol
[00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:26.320]   for adults, provided they're not alcoholics.
[00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:29.640]   Turns out two drinks a week, probably fine health-wise.
[00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:31.240]   Zero would be better.
[00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:34.440]   If we're honest, zero is better than any alcohol.
[00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:36.300]   But two drinks a week is probably fine.
[00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:38.700]   Past two drinks, you start running into problems.
[00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:42.200]   And yet many, many people out there, male and female alike,
[00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:47.900]   suffer from alcohol use disorder, also called alcoholism.
[00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:51.040]   The same is also true for things like methamphetamine
[00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:55.140]   or cocaine or other types of substance addictions.
[00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:58.420]   And the same is also true for a lot of behavioral
[00:38:58.420 --> 00:39:00.620]   or what are sometimes called process addictions,
[00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:03.460]   things like sex addiction or video game addiction
[00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:07.240]   or any type of behavior that frankly
[00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:09.920]   is leveraging the dopamine system,
[00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:12.900]   but that engages this progressive narrowing
[00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:14.880]   of the things that bring someone pleasure
[00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:17.340]   such that nothing else is really salient.
[00:39:17.340 --> 00:39:19.620]   Nothing else is really pulling them in
[00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:21.580]   in the way that they're video games
[00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:25.500]   or sex or pornography or alcohol,
[00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:29.460]   pick your substance or behavior that you see out there
[00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:31.900]   or hopefully not, but that you might suffer
[00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:33.360]   from an addiction too.
[00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:35.440]   So what's happening in addiction?
[00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:39.660]   Well, addiction involves dopamine among other things often,
[00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:41.500]   the opioid system, et cetera.
[00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:44.540]   But if we were to think about what's the stimulus
[00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:48.580]   in an addiction and what's the peak in dopamine,
[00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:51.540]   and then what happens after that peak,
[00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:55.040]   it all becomes very clear as to why addiction happens
[00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:57.380]   and why it's so pernicious.
[00:39:57.380 --> 00:39:59.260]   So for instance, let's take cocaine.
[00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:02.940]   Cocaine causes dramatic increases in dopamine
[00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:04.460]   very, very fast.
[00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:08.500]   So if somebody craves cocaine, what are they craving?
[00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:10.020]   They're craving that dopamine peak.
[00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:13.400]   They're craving the increased level of alertness.
[00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:16.160]   They're craving a number of things associated
[00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:19.780]   with the feeling of being under the influence of the drug.
[00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:23.800]   But the stimulus for it simply becomes that line of cocaine
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:24.900]   or in the case of crack,
[00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:27.680]   that crack rock that they're going to smoke,
[00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:29.340]   and God forbid they're mainlining it,
[00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:31.200]   they're shooting into a vein.
[00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:36.200]   What happens is they snort, smoke, or inject cocaine,
[00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:40.340]   and dopamine levels almost immediately go up, up, up, up,
[00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:42.460]   up, up to a very high peak, okay?
[00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:46.320]   So the time gap between the stimulus and the dopamine
[00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:48.360]   is very, very short.
[00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:49.940]   So short, in fact,
[00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:53.280]   that there's really no other contingencies in between
[00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:56.720]   that the mesocortical system has to learn.
[00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:59.860]   In fact, what does the system, quote unquote, learn?
[00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:04.840]   It learns cocaine equals massive amounts of dopamine
[00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:08.100]   equals feeling euphoric and energetic, et cetera.
[00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:12.600]   And in doing that, it reinforces the whole circuit
[00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:17.600]   so that that short, we can even say hyper short contingency,
[00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:20.300]   is really what the system wants.
[00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:24.520]   So much so that longer contingencies of, say,
[00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:27.340]   putting in the hard work of, you know,
[00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:30.140]   generating a fitness program or a professional program
[00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:32.820]   for yourself or a education program,
[00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:36.380]   which takes not just many days, but many weeks and years,
[00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:38.940]   well, none of that is going to lead to peaks in dopamine
[00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:41.400]   that are as high as the peak in dopamine
[00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:43.100]   associated with cocaine.
[00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:45.460]   So that tells us something critical.
[00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:50.460]   It is both the duration between desire and effect.
[00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:53.020]   And when I say effect, I mean the rewarding properties
[00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:54.680]   of dopamine that are experienced.
[00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:58.260]   That's important, so very short gaps teach the system
[00:41:58.260 --> 00:42:01.640]   to expect and want short gaps.
[00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:05.020]   Makes it very hard to pursue things that take longer.
[00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:08.180]   So when we say it's the short, or in this case,
[00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:12.440]   hyper short distance or time between the stimulus
[00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:14.560]   and the dopamine, what we're really talking about,
[00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:16.920]   if we were to plot this out on a board
[00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:17.960]   or on a piece of paper,
[00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:20.600]   is the steepness of the rise of that peak.
[00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:22.040]   It's very, very steep.
[00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:24.800]   The peak in dopamine is coming up very fast
[00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:25.940]   after the desire.
[00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:31.160]   And in addition to that, and this is very important,
[00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:33.020]   the higher the peak in dopamine
[00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:36.180]   and the faster the rise to that peak,
[00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:39.640]   the further below baseline the dopamine drops
[00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:41.960]   after the drug wears off.
[00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:43.260]   Okay, so in the case of cocaine,
[00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:46.840]   it's a very fast and very large rise in dopamine
[00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:51.840]   followed by a steep drop and very deep trough
[00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:53.900]   in dopamine below baseline.
[00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:56.560]   You say, okay, so there's pleasure,
[00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:58.340]   then there's lack of pleasure.
[00:42:58.340 --> 00:43:00.780]   Ah, but it's worse than that.
[00:43:00.780 --> 00:43:03.140]   Because it's not just lack of pleasure.
[00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:05.480]   If you recall what we talked about a little bit earlier,
[00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:09.740]   that drop below baseline triggers the desire
[00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:11.660]   and the pursuit for what?
[00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:13.140]   For more.
[00:43:13.140 --> 00:43:15.380]   And so this sets in motion a vicious loop
[00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:18.060]   where people start pursuing peaks in dopamine
[00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:20.880]   that can come very fast without much effort.
[00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:22.460]   And that's one of the ways
[00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:24.520]   in which addiction starts to take hold.
[00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:27.540]   There's a simple way to think about this
[00:43:27.540 --> 00:43:30.360]   and to remember if you want to avoid this whole thing.
[00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:31.840]   I mean, the first one is obvious.
[00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:33.760]   Don't do cocaine, don't try it, don't use it.
[00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:36.020]   Certainly don't get addicted to it.
[00:43:36.020 --> 00:43:37.440]   Those are all sort of one in the same, frankly.
[00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:39.600]   I don't know many people that,
[00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:42.160]   despite opinions to the contrary,
[00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:44.340]   that use cocaine recreationally,
[00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:46.880]   that don't at some point run into either a financial,
[00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:50.600]   psychological, physical, or some other problem.
[00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:52.960]   The other thing that's absolutely critical to keep in mind,
[00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:55.020]   and this was discussed in my colleague,
[00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:57.680]   Dr. Anna Lemke's book, "Dopamine Nation,"
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:43:59.720]   and on this podcast, excellent book, by the way,
[00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:00.680]   I highly recommend it.
[00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:01.800]   If you haven't read it already,
[00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:04.980]   it's a fascinating exploration into dopamine
[00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:06.160]   as it relates to addiction,
[00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:08.880]   not just drug addiction, but other types of addiction.
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:10.560]   Again, the name of that book is "Dopamine Nation."
[00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:13.160]   We'll provide a link to it in the show note captions.
[00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:15.580]   The other thing that happens
[00:44:15.580 --> 00:44:19.240]   after those big, fast increases in dopamine
[00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:23.140]   caused by things like cocaine is afterwards,
[00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:25.260]   when it quickly drops below baseline,
[00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:28.360]   it takes a much longer time
[00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:31.080]   to get back to the original baseline
[00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:33.800]   than it did prior to using the drug.
[00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:38.040]   And worse still is that the peaks in dopamine
[00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:41.880]   that are created from more consumption of cocaine
[00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:44.760]   leads to progressively lower peaks
[00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:48.540]   and deeper troughs below baseline.
[00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:50.920]   So the whole system is shifting away from pleasure
[00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:55.020]   and more to pain and the desire for pursuit of the drug.
[00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:58.500]   This is a terrible situation,
[00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:00.280]   and it's a terrible situation
[00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:01.800]   that's not just unique to cocaine.
[00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:04.480]   In fact, if we were to look at the averages,
[00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:05.980]   and again, these are averages,
[00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:08.460]   of the height of the peaks in dopamine
[00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:10.120]   that are created by different substances
[00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:12.700]   and the rates at which those peaks take place,
[00:45:12.700 --> 00:45:15.960]   'cause remember, the time to peak is just as important
[00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:18.300]   as how high that peak goes,
[00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:20.200]   we see some pretty interesting numbers.
[00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:21.380]   So for instance, and again,
[00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:23.460]   these are averages based on neuroimaging
[00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:26.420]   combined with what are called PET scans,
[00:45:26.420 --> 00:45:29.120]   positron emission tomography, combined with blood draws
[00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:30.660]   and a number of other data
[00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:32.940]   from both animal and human studies.
[00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:35.300]   What you find is that at baseline,
[00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:39.820]   just kind of on a background of no drug taking of any kind,
[00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:43.560]   the neurons in the ventral tegmental nucleus accumbens area
[00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:46.640]   are firing at a rate of about three to four per second,
[00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:48.680]   releasing dopamine, so that's your baseline
[00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:50.760]   of dopamine release, your forebrain is always seeing
[00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:54.000]   a little bit of dopamine from that system.
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.440]   If you were then to anticipate food
[00:45:56.440 --> 00:45:59.920]   and you're relatively hungry, that would double, okay?
[00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:02.120]   So this probably happened when you decide to eat lunch today
[00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:04.480]   if you were hungry prior to eating lunch.
[00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:06.480]   It doubles in the anticipation of the food,
[00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:09.500]   and then depending on how much you enjoyed that food,
[00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:12.800]   it might triple or quadruple, it might be lower
[00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:16.040]   than it was during the anticipations we talked about before.
[00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:19.720]   So there's an approximate doubling under conditions
[00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:23.520]   of desiring and consuming food.
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:26.920]   Let's take nicotine as the next example.
[00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:31.860]   For people that use nicotine, either smoking, vaping,
[00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:36.860]   snuffing, or dipping, all routes of nicotine administration
[00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:39.480]   that I covered in our episode about nicotine,
[00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:43.720]   there's about a 150% increase
[00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:46.640]   in the rate of dopamine neuron firing.
[00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:50.400]   Cocaine is going to increase the rate of dopamine output
[00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:54.520]   into the prefrontal cortex by about 1,000%, okay?
[00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:56.340]   So what you're really talking about here
[00:46:56.340 --> 00:47:00.660]   is a 10-fold increase in the amount of dopamine
[00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:02.160]   that's released into the prefrontal cortex
[00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:05.440]   as measured by the rates of firing of these dopamine neurons.
[00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:09.680]   Methamphetamine is going to be anywhere from 1,000%,
[00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:11.440]   anywhere up to 10,000%.
[00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:13.920]   It really varies depending on the potency of the drug
[00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:15.580]   and a few other factors.
[00:47:15.580 --> 00:47:17.720]   And here's where perhaps it gets a little more interesting.
[00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:20.460]   Some of you are probably wondering about caffeine
[00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:22.960]   or about sex or about video games.
[00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:25.440]   Now, there are the numbers vary tremendously,
[00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:27.240]   and it's really important to understand
[00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:30.800]   that across the board, not just for caffeine, sex,
[00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:35.700]   video games, but also for nicotine, alcohol,
[00:47:35.700 --> 00:47:40.120]   and other substances and what we call motivated behaviors,
[00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:41.680]   some of which are part of a healthy life,
[00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:43.600]   like eating and reproduction,
[00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:47.560]   provided it's age-appropriate, context-appropriate,
[00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:49.240]   species-appropriate, consensual,
[00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:52.260]   well, then we consider it adaptive.
[00:47:52.260 --> 00:47:55.060]   If it's not, well, then consider it maladaptive.
[00:47:55.060 --> 00:47:59.100]   Some people will sit down to play a video game.
[00:47:59.100 --> 00:48:00.620]   They really like video games.
[00:48:00.620 --> 00:48:02.360]   And as they're sitting down,
[00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:05.400]   they will experience a five-fold increase
[00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:08.300]   in the rate of dopamine output from their nucleus accumbens.
[00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:10.200]   For other people, it's going to be a 10-fold increase.
[00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:11.600]   For other people like me
[00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:13.000]   who don't like video games very much,
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.060]   I don't have anything against them, I don't dislike them,
[00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:17.260]   but it doesn't do much for me,
[00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:19.100]   it might not cause any increase whatsoever.
[00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:21.420]   It might even cause a decrease in dopamine.
[00:48:21.420 --> 00:48:23.480]   So there's a lot of individual variability.
[00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:25.620]   For sex, it turns out to be a range.
[00:48:25.620 --> 00:48:28.580]   So the typical range that's cited in the literature
[00:48:28.580 --> 00:48:31.120]   is anywhere from a four to five-fold increase
[00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:33.900]   in the rate of dopamine neuron firing.
[00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:35.580]   However, there are certain individuals
[00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:37.460]   for which that number is doubled.
[00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:39.500]   Caffeine is a little bit of a special circumstance
[00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:42.040]   because caffeine has the property
[00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:43.980]   of not just causing the release of dopamine,
[00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:47.340]   but increasing the amount of dopamine receptors over time.
[00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:49.840]   And there aren't a lot of excellent measurements
[00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:51.900]   of the amount of dopamine released
[00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:53.920]   as a function of caffeine intake
[00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:55.940]   in different populations of humans.
[00:48:55.940 --> 00:48:57.500]   It's mostly animal studies.
[00:48:57.500 --> 00:48:59.980]   But what we think based on the gestalt,
[00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:02.340]   based on the overall picture of the literature,
[00:49:02.340 --> 00:49:04.500]   is that it's an approximate doubling
[00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:07.340]   of the dopamine signaling that's coming out
[00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:10.840]   of the VTA nucleus accumbens to prefrontal cortex
[00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:14.800]   when we anticipate and when we drink our coffee.
[00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:16.460]   Again, I really want to be clear
[00:49:16.460 --> 00:49:18.580]   that for all of these things,
[00:49:18.580 --> 00:49:21.280]   these are relative levels and they are distribution.
[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:23.540]   So if we were to plot them out on paper,
[00:49:23.540 --> 00:49:25.460]   you would see that these are not bar graphs.
[00:49:25.460 --> 00:49:27.560]   These are overlapping curves to some extent.
[00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:30.820]   So some people are going to achieve more dopamine release
[00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:33.680]   or less dopamine release from one behavior or substance.
[00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:38.060]   However, it's very clear that cocaine, methamphetamine,
[00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:39.660]   even heroin for that matter,
[00:49:39.660 --> 00:49:42.660]   are way out on the right-hand side of the curve,
[00:49:42.660 --> 00:49:46.200]   causing enormous increases in dopamine very quickly.
[00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:48.760]   And the other things that we described have, again,
[00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:52.160]   a distribution that is more leftward shifted
[00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:54.880]   on this imaginary plot that I'm creating.
[00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:57.060]   It's a lot of individual variability.
[00:49:57.060 --> 00:49:59.900]   However, it's fascinating that dopamine
[00:49:59.900 --> 00:50:03.620]   is the single molecule that's causing the craving
[00:50:03.620 --> 00:50:06.120]   and pursuit and experience
[00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:08.740]   of all of these substances and behaviors.
[00:50:08.740 --> 00:50:12.380]   And the learning of all of that craving, pursuit,
[00:50:12.380 --> 00:50:14.900]   and actual experience is what predicts whether or not
[00:50:14.900 --> 00:50:19.140]   we will re-engage, reuse that substance or not,
[00:50:19.140 --> 00:50:20.940]   re-engage in a behavior or not,
[00:50:20.940 --> 00:50:22.940]   and how frequently we will do that.
[00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:24.260]   So that's addiction.
[00:50:24.260 --> 00:50:27.060]   But if you understand how the height of those peaks
[00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:30.300]   in dopamine and the rate to reach those peaks
[00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:33.000]   and the troughs that result and how long the troughs take
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:33.900]   to get back to baseline,
[00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:36.660]   if you understand or a little or all of that,
[00:50:36.660 --> 00:50:38.620]   you're really in a terrific position to understand
[00:50:38.620 --> 00:50:40.480]   how to leverage the dopamine system
[00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:43.660]   for the pursuit of healthy goals and behaviors.
[00:50:43.660 --> 00:50:46.220]   I should mention one thing about recovery from addiction,
[00:50:46.220 --> 00:50:48.840]   which is that the reset of all that dopamine circuitry
[00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:51.560]   from unhealthy to healthy often involves,
[00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:55.160]   depending on the addiction, 30 days of complete abstinence.
[00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:58.620]   That 30 days of complete abstinence inevitably involves
[00:50:58.620 --> 00:51:00.540]   a lot of pain and discomfort and craving,
[00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:04.360]   anxiety, insomnia, et cetera, that relates to the big trough
[00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:07.040]   in dopamine that inevitably occurs.
[00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:08.640]   Now, of course, there are some addictions,
[00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:10.760]   such as severe alcohol addiction,
[00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:13.300]   and in some cases, opiate addiction,
[00:51:13.300 --> 00:51:16.480]   that immediate and sustained abstinence
[00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:18.320]   cannot be used as the tool.
[00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:20.620]   Somebody really needs to work with an addiction specialist,
[00:51:20.620 --> 00:51:22.520]   and sometimes there needs to be a tapering off
[00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:23.360]   of the substance.
[00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:26.400]   For other addictions, it can be quote unquote cold turkey.
[00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:28.740]   And then of course, there are other addictions,
[00:51:28.740 --> 00:51:30.600]   particular food and sex,
[00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:32.800]   but sometimes even things like video games,
[00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:35.880]   for which the desired outcome is not necessarily
[00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:38.100]   to eliminate the behavior completely,
[00:51:38.100 --> 00:51:40.360]   but to set some constraints around the behavior
[00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:43.100]   so that it's not occurring to the exclusion
[00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:45.240]   of other pleasureful things in life
[00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:46.560]   and adaptive things in life.
[00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:49.380]   And for that, there is the requirement
[00:51:49.380 --> 00:51:51.040]   for what are called binding behaviors.
[00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:52.820]   We'll get back to binding behaviors later.
[00:51:52.820 --> 00:51:54.960]   A binding behaviors are behaviors
[00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:57.280]   in which people bind their behavior
[00:51:58.120 --> 00:52:01.280]   around a particular substance use
[00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:04.980]   or around a particular behavioral addiction,
[00:52:04.980 --> 00:52:07.140]   like sex, video games, et cetera,
[00:52:07.140 --> 00:52:08.940]   in space and/or time.
[00:52:08.940 --> 00:52:11.060]   In space meaning they might only engage
[00:52:11.060 --> 00:52:14.340]   in those particular behaviors in certain places
[00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:16.760]   and certain times when it's context appropriate.
[00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:18.800]   There are numerous examples of binding behaviors
[00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:19.980]   in space and time.
[00:52:19.980 --> 00:52:23.680]   It all has to do with clamping or directing
[00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:27.140]   when the engagement with the dopamine releasing behavior
[00:52:27.140 --> 00:52:28.440]   is going to occur.
[00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:30.960]   So what's happening when people decide to go cold turkey
[00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:33.140]   or they use these binding behaviors?
[00:52:33.140 --> 00:52:35.860]   Well, what's happening is that people are engaging
[00:52:35.860 --> 00:52:39.480]   the specific circuitry within the prefrontal cortex
[00:52:39.480 --> 00:52:41.340]   that, as I mentioned at the beginning of the episode,
[00:52:41.340 --> 00:52:43.460]   are important for context setting.
[00:52:43.460 --> 00:52:45.640]   So in the cases of binding behaviors,
[00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:48.680]   the prefrontal cortex is essentially getting trained up
[00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:51.020]   to understand that, okay, certain things like food
[00:52:51.020 --> 00:52:54.920]   or perhaps sex or perhaps video games,
[00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:58.640]   they're okay if they are done or consumed
[00:52:58.640 --> 00:53:02.940]   in appropriate amounts or in particular contexts.
[00:53:02.940 --> 00:53:06.700]   That requires the context setting goal-directed behavior
[00:53:06.700 --> 00:53:08.600]   that the prefrontal cortex is responsible.
[00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:10.240]   Okay, so for the last 10 or 15 minutes,
[00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:12.040]   we've been talking a lot about addiction,
[00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:15.120]   and actually this is not an episode about addiction.
[00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:16.880]   However, if you understand a little bit
[00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:19.480]   about the dopamine dynamics in an addiction,
[00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:21.200]   you can leverage that knowledge
[00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:23.760]   towards healthy adaptive goal pursuit
[00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:25.700]   and achieving your goals.
[00:53:25.700 --> 00:53:28.560]   So let's think about that in the context
[00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:30.960]   of what generates dopamine peaks,
[00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:34.400]   what generates desire to pursue goals,
[00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:37.200]   what causes our readout of whether or not
[00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:39.280]   we achieved a goal or not.
[00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:42.060]   In other words, what allows us to learn
[00:53:42.060 --> 00:53:44.160]   how to pursue goals of different kinds,
[00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:46.440]   not just get good at achieving one kind of goal,
[00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:49.200]   but really understand and get really, really good
[00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:52.760]   at setting goals and pursuing goals of different kinds
[00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:55.200]   that are adaptive in different areas of life,
[00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:57.000]   because we all are going to have to pursue goals
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:01.820]   in school, work, relationships, fitness, mental health,
[00:54:01.820 --> 00:54:05.980]   and on and on in order to be our best selves, that's clear.
[00:54:05.980 --> 00:54:09.480]   Well, all of that is possible using the same basic set
[00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:14.060]   of dopamine circuits and the same basic dynamics of dopamine.
[00:54:14.060 --> 00:54:17.740]   So for instance, if we are going to feel motivated at all,
[00:54:17.740 --> 00:54:20.160]   that is, if we are going to wake up in the morning
[00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:21.920]   or have any period of time during our day
[00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:25.740]   in which we feel like we are capable of pursuing goals,
[00:54:25.740 --> 00:54:28.360]   we are going to have to have a healthy level
[00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:30.200]   of baseline dopamine.
[00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:32.700]   In other words, we are going to have to have enough dopamine
[00:54:32.700 --> 00:54:36.960]   in the wave pool, enough water in the wave pool, that is,
[00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:39.960]   before we can generate any waves or peaks in dopamine,
[00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:42.000]   let alone troughs and the rest.
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:45.400]   So how do we achieve a healthy baseline level of dopamine?
[00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:47.360]   Well, there we can really look
[00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:49.120]   to some foundational practices,
[00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:50.880]   practices that perhaps you've heard about
[00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:52.240]   on this podcast before,
[00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:54.500]   and that to some of you might seem a little mundane,
[00:54:54.500 --> 00:54:56.560]   although some of them are a bit more sophisticated,
[00:54:56.560 --> 00:54:58.120]   maybe even esoteric.
[00:54:58.120 --> 00:55:00.560]   The good news is that we can all control these things,
[00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:03.160]   and they don't require purchasing anything,
[00:55:03.160 --> 00:55:06.920]   but they do require some degree of regular upkeep and effort.
[00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:11.500]   Those things include what I call the very basics.
[00:55:11.500 --> 00:55:14.080]   Now, the very basics put in the context
[00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:15.520]   of today's discussion are the things
[00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:18.240]   that put water in the wave pool.
[00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:20.880]   Those are going to be getting sufficient amounts
[00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:22.380]   of quality sleep each night,
[00:55:22.380 --> 00:55:24.300]   something that we've done several episodes on
[00:55:24.300 --> 00:55:25.960]   and have online toolkits for.
[00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:27.640]   So you can see the Master Your Sleep episode,
[00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:28.920]   the Perfect Your Sleep episode,
[00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:30.520]   the Light and Health episode.
[00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:31.440]   If you want to skip all that
[00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:34.800]   and just get right to the tools, we have a sleep toolkit,
[00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:36.240]   or it's actually called the Toolkit for Sleep,
[00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:38.080]   that you can access at hubermanlab.com.
[00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:39.560]   Completely zero cost.
[00:55:39.560 --> 00:55:41.720]   You just go there and download that toolkit.
[00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:44.000]   Getting sufficient sleep each night
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:47.320]   literally restores your dopamine reserves.
[00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:49.120]   It allows dopamine to be present
[00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:51.740]   and for you to have a level of baseline dopamine
[00:55:51.740 --> 00:55:54.120]   that will allow you to even consider your goals
[00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:57.120]   in any kind of meaningful or reasonable way.
[00:55:57.120 --> 00:56:00.240]   Second, there are practices that are supported
[00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:01.520]   by the scientific literature
[00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:04.180]   to increase your baseline level of dopamine
[00:56:04.180 --> 00:56:07.080]   that are independent of sleep, but are similar to sleep,
[00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:09.960]   and I like to refer to these as a non-sleep deep rest.
[00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:11.900]   This is not meditation.
[00:56:11.900 --> 00:56:13.880]   There's actually very little evidence
[00:56:13.880 --> 00:56:16.080]   that meditation of the traditional kind
[00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:19.840]   of sitting eyes closed, focusing on your third eye center,
[00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:21.640]   which is this area behind your forehead,
[00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:23.160]   there is very little evidence
[00:56:23.160 --> 00:56:25.440]   that that increases levels of dopamine.
[00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:26.720]   There is a place for meditation
[00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:30.520]   in the context of today's discussion, but I'll repeat.
[00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:33.300]   Meditation itself is a focusing exercise.
[00:56:33.300 --> 00:56:35.200]   It is not known to increase dopamine.
[00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:38.340]   However, non-sleep deep rest, so-called NSDR,
[00:56:38.340 --> 00:56:39.680]   very similar, although different
[00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:41.600]   to what's sometimes called yoga nidra,
[00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:44.280]   which is where you lie there, you do a sort of body scan,
[00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:47.560]   some long exhale breathing, NSDR is very similar.
[00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:52.340]   You can find a link to a zero-cost NSDR on YouTube.
[00:56:52.340 --> 00:56:53.360]   It's a 10-minute long one.
[00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:55.880]   There are also 20 and 30-minute ones out there,
[00:56:55.880 --> 00:56:57.240]   also on YouTube, but I'll provide a link
[00:56:57.240 --> 00:56:58.280]   to the 10-minute one.
[00:56:58.280 --> 00:57:02.740]   Those have been shown to increase the amount of dopamine
[00:57:02.740 --> 00:57:06.760]   in your dopamine reserves by up to 65%,
[00:57:06.760 --> 00:57:08.160]   which is a remarkable number.
[00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:12.000]   So quality sleep, non-sleep deep rest, aka yoga nidra,
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:15.840]   very powerful ways to keep your baseline level of dopamine
[00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:17.360]   at a sufficient level.
[00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:20.880]   In addition to that, nutrition no doubt plays a role
[00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:22.360]   in your baseline level of dopamine,
[00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:24.600]   because tyrosine, the amino acid,
[00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:28.280]   is the rate-limiting enzyme for the synthesis of dopamine.
[00:57:28.280 --> 00:57:31.920]   Tyrosine is present in varying levels in different foods.
[00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:33.200]   You can look those up online.
[00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:35.060]   You can just simply put in a search
[00:57:35.060 --> 00:57:37.840]   for tyrosine levels in different foods,
[00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:39.840]   everything from particular cheeses,
[00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:43.000]   like Parmesan cheese has high levels of tyrosine,
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:45.400]   certain meats, certain nuts, certain vegetables.
[00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:47.000]   Without getting into details and specifics,
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.380]   you can find those there, but you need proper nutrition
[00:57:49.380 --> 00:57:53.040]   and therefore nutrients, in particular tyrosine,
[00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:57.120]   in order to have sufficient levels of baseline dopamine.
[00:57:57.120 --> 00:57:58.420]   The third thing on the list, and again,
[00:57:58.420 --> 00:58:00.440]   these are things that we come back to almost every episode,
[00:58:00.440 --> 00:58:01.940]   but I don't think they can be repeated enough,
[00:58:01.940 --> 00:58:03.040]   because these are really things
[00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:05.820]   that we need to focus on every 24 hours.
[00:58:05.820 --> 00:58:07.340]   You might be able to skip a day here or there
[00:58:07.340 --> 00:58:09.160]   if you get sick or you're traveling,
[00:58:09.160 --> 00:58:10.520]   or you have some major life event,
[00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:14.560]   but really every 24 hours, we need to re-up our sleep.
[00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:17.180]   We need to re-up our nutrients.
[00:58:17.180 --> 00:58:19.040]   Even if you're fasting, you're re-upping your nutrients
[00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:21.760]   from stored sources within your body.
[00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:23.520]   The third thing is sunlight,
[00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:24.840]   morning sunlight in particular.
[00:58:24.840 --> 00:58:27.360]   I've done extensive episodes about this.
[00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:28.880]   Check out the episode on lighting your health
[00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:30.340]   if you want all the details,
[00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:32.200]   but you want to try and view sunlight
[00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:33.840]   as early in the day as possible,
[00:58:33.840 --> 00:58:36.480]   five to 10 minutes on a clear day,
[00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:39.520]   minimum 10 to 20 minutes on a cloudy day,
[00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:43.640]   minimum 20 or 30 minutes on a very overcast day,
[00:58:43.640 --> 00:58:45.660]   minimum without sunglasses.
[00:58:45.660 --> 00:58:47.080]   Don't stare at the sun.
[00:58:47.080 --> 00:58:48.380]   Please don't damage your eyes.
[00:58:48.380 --> 00:58:50.040]   Look off, slightly off from the sun,
[00:58:50.040 --> 00:58:52.120]   but yes, you want to face eastward towards the sun,
[00:58:52.120 --> 00:58:53.340]   and on those cloudy days,
[00:58:53.340 --> 00:58:55.000]   that's especially important to do.
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:55.840]   Why?
[00:58:55.840 --> 00:58:57.620]   Well, viewing morning sunlight
[00:58:57.620 --> 00:58:59.320]   increases cortisol early in the day,
[00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:02.960]   which is excellent because you want cortisol elevated
[00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:04.960]   early in the day and you want it lower later in the day,
[00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:06.860]   and because of the relationship
[00:59:06.860 --> 00:59:09.600]   between the cells in your eye that sense sunlight,
[00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:11.320]   specifically morning sunlight,
[00:59:11.320 --> 00:59:12.640]   believe it or not, that happens,
[00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:14.160]   and signal to your hypothalamus
[00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:16.240]   and the relationship between the hypothalamus
[00:59:16.240 --> 00:59:19.720]   and the pituitary and other endocrine organs,
[00:59:19.720 --> 00:59:23.600]   it sets in motion a dopamine-related cascade
[00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:26.540]   in neuromodulators, dopamine,
[00:59:26.540 --> 00:59:29.880]   and hormones that lead to states of wellbeing,
[00:59:29.880 --> 00:59:32.700]   elevated mood, alertness, et cetera, throughout the day.
[00:59:32.700 --> 00:59:33.880]   It also helps your sleep at night,
[00:59:33.880 --> 00:59:35.040]   but today we're talking about dopamine.
[00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:36.140]   So yes, believe it or not,
[00:59:36.140 --> 00:59:37.480]   that morning sunlight exposure
[00:59:37.480 --> 00:59:41.520]   does increase your levels of dopamine, not just cortisol.
[00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:44.120]   And fourth on the list is going to be movement,
[00:59:44.120 --> 00:59:46.000]   exercise of varying kinds.
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:47.000]   It could be resistance training,
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:48.420]   it could be cardiovascular training.
[00:59:48.420 --> 00:59:50.960]   That does increase levels of dopamine.
[00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:54.600]   Here, we're not talking about achieving peaks in dopamine.
[00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:55.720]   That could be accomplished
[00:59:55.720 --> 00:59:57.940]   through setting a personal record, a PR,
[00:59:57.940 --> 01:00:00.500]   or through sprints or heavy lifts,
[01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:02.540]   or learning some new dynamic movement.
[01:00:02.540 --> 01:00:04.100]   What we're really talking about here
[01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:06.620]   is getting into a regular exercise program
[01:00:06.620 --> 01:00:09.700]   of if not every day, at least five days a week,
[01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:12.560]   a mixture of cardiovascular and resistance exercise.
[01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:16.160]   That we also know is known to elevate
[01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:20.220]   and maintain an elevated level of baseline dopamine.
[01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:22.280]   So it's not just about the euphoria you feel
[01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:24.060]   during or after exercise.
[01:00:24.060 --> 01:00:27.500]   It's also about the baseline level of dopamine
[01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:29.820]   that's achieved through regular movement
[01:00:29.820 --> 01:00:31.060]   and engaging in movement.
[01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:32.560]   And if you're asking, how could that be?
[01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:34.400]   Well, you already know the answer.
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:37.600]   The circuits in the brain and body that generate movement,
[01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:40.380]   not just goal-seeking, but movement itself,
[01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:44.320]   as I mentioned earlier, that nigrostriatal pathway.
[01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:46.520]   And yes, that circuit is separate
[01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:49.700]   from the VTA nucleus accumbens to cortical circuit,
[01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:50.860]   the mesocortical circuit
[01:00:50.860 --> 01:00:54.140]   that we've mainly been focusing on today, but they interact.
[01:00:54.140 --> 01:00:56.180]   And so by engaging in regular movement,
[01:00:56.180 --> 01:00:58.660]   you ensure that you're maintaining elevated levels
[01:00:58.660 --> 01:01:01.220]   of baseline dopamine, which is what you want
[01:01:01.220 --> 01:01:02.620]   if you're going to be able to engage
[01:01:02.620 --> 01:01:05.880]   in any kind of motivated pursuit behavior of any kind.
[01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:09.300]   So those are the fundamentals that will set the level
[01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:12.820]   of baseline dopamine in your system.
[01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:14.100]   A couple of key points.
[01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:18.020]   Yes, there is variation based on both genetics
[01:01:18.020 --> 01:01:20.340]   and circumstance in baseline levels of dopamine.
[01:01:20.340 --> 01:01:22.540]   Someone's going through a particularly hard time,
[01:01:22.540 --> 01:01:24.380]   or if somebody inherited a gene
[01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:26.260]   in the dopamine synthesis pathway
[01:01:26.260 --> 01:01:28.760]   that simply affords them higher levels of baseline dopamine.
[01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:30.260]   We likely know these people.
[01:01:30.260 --> 01:01:31.980]   They seem hyper-motivated all the time,
[01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:34.280]   not just based on prior success,
[01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:36.300]   but they just seem to have a lot of energy
[01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:37.620]   and a lot of go drive.
[01:01:37.620 --> 01:01:39.300]   You know, you talk about activation energy.
[01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:40.740]   Some of you may know what that term means.
[01:01:40.740 --> 01:01:41.940]   Others of you won't.
[01:01:41.940 --> 01:01:43.740]   Having low activation energy is great.
[01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:45.160]   I mean, the amount of energy that it takes
[01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:47.260]   to get into action to pursue adaptive
[01:01:47.260 --> 01:01:48.580]   and meaningful, healthy goals.
[01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:51.120]   Some people just seem to have lower activation energy
[01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:52.460]   and higher levels of dopamine
[01:01:52.460 --> 01:01:54.800]   are probably associated with that.
[01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:57.700]   Some of us have lower levels of baseline dopamine.
[01:01:57.700 --> 01:02:00.060]   Regardless, everyone needs to engage
[01:02:00.060 --> 01:02:02.440]   in the foundational things
[01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:04.320]   that I just mentioned a few moments ago,
[01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:06.900]   every 24 hours, or at least strive to.
[01:02:06.900 --> 01:02:08.360]   There is no escaping that.
[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:09.920]   I'd like to just take a brief moment
[01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:11.760]   and thank one of our podcast sponsors,
[01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:13.060]   which is InsideTracker.
[01:02:13.060 --> 01:02:15.720]   InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:18.300]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[01:02:18.300 --> 01:02:19.860]   to help you better understand your body
[01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:21.740]   and help you reach your health goals.
[01:02:21.740 --> 01:02:24.020]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:27.000]   for the simple reason that blood work is the only way
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.340]   that you can monitor the markers, such as hormone markers,
[01:02:29.340 --> 01:02:31.460]   lipids, metabolic factors, et cetera,
[01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:34.200]   that impact your immediate and long-term health.
[01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:36.320]   One major challenge with blood work, however,
[01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:38.920]   is that most of the time it does not come back
[01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:40.540]   with any information about what to do
[01:02:40.540 --> 01:02:42.780]   in order to move the values for hormones,
[01:02:42.780 --> 01:02:44.660]   metabolic factors, lipids, et cetera,
[01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:46.080]   into the ranges that you want.
[01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:48.540]   With InsideTracker, changing those values
[01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:49.700]   becomes very straightforward
[01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:52.640]   because it has a personalized dashboard that you can use
[01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:55.680]   to address the nutrition-based, behavior-based,
[01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:58.420]   supplement-based approaches that you can use
[01:02:58.420 --> 01:03:00.560]   in order to move those values into the ranges
[01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:03.580]   that are optimal for you, your vitality, and your longevity.
[01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:05.320]   InsideTracker now includes a measurement
[01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:07.800]   of apolipoprotein B, so-called apoB,
[01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:08.960]   in their ultimate plan.
[01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:11.640]   ApoB is a key marker of cardiovascular health,
[01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:13.400]   and therefore there's extreme value
[01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:15.400]   to knowing your apoB levels.
[01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:16.800]   If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:19.520]   you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman
[01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:21.840]   to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans.
[01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:26.080]   Again, that's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off.
[01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:27.560]   Now, there are things that can increase
[01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:30.520]   one's baseline level of dopamine further,
[01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:34.360]   and some of those get us into the realm of supplements
[01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:35.700]   and prescription drugs, but for now,
[01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:37.140]   I just want to mention a few of them
[01:03:37.140 --> 01:03:40.200]   that are purely behavioral in nature, are zero cost,
[01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:42.800]   and that have been shown in the research literature
[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:45.200]   to increase baseline levels of dopamine
[01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:46.480]   for long periods of time.
[01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:48.680]   And this is important because if any of you
[01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:50.080]   are out there listening to this thing
[01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:52.340]   about peaks and troughs and baselines,
[01:03:52.340 --> 01:03:54.360]   you might be asking, well, wait,
[01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:58.340]   what's the difference between a baseline and a peak, really?
[01:03:58.340 --> 01:04:02.480]   Because if, for instance, you get a big peak,
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:04.280]   well, that's a peak in the baseline,
[01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:06.640]   so how do you distinguish between peak and baseline?
[01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:08.100]   And, well, there's a trough,
[01:04:08.100 --> 01:04:09.920]   and let's say that trough lasts an hour,
[01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:12.520]   is that hour-long trough your baseline?
[01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:14.160]   Or where's your set point?
[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:15.760]   How do you establish your set point?
[01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:18.080]   And more importantly, how do you raise your set point?
[01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:20.120]   Ah, well, if you're not already asking that question,
[01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:21.760]   I just asked it for you.
[01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:24.980]   I define an increase in your baseline level in dopamine
[01:04:24.980 --> 01:04:26.960]   to be anything that increases dopamine
[01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:29.160]   for more than one hour.
[01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:32.880]   When we think about cocaine, amphetamine, pornography,
[01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:35.160]   sex, caffeine, things of that sort,
[01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:37.480]   regardless of how long one engages
[01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:40.260]   in a bout of those behaviors or substances,
[01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:42.960]   the increases in dopamine are going to be
[01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:44.120]   relatively short-lived,
[01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:47.200]   on the order of minutes to an hour, sometimes longer.
[01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:48.760]   Now, I didn't say that's how long
[01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:49.920]   you're engaging in the behaviors,
[01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:52.360]   I said that's how long those increases in dopamine
[01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:53.380]   are going to occur,
[01:04:53.380 --> 01:04:56.000]   even if you were to continually engage in those behaviors.
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.800]   And remember, with continual engagement
[01:04:57.800 --> 01:05:00.440]   in a dopamine-spiking behavior,
[01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:02.420]   behavior that increases dopamine peaks,
[01:05:02.420 --> 01:05:03.760]   the height of those peaks, remember,
[01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:05.040]   gets lower and lower and lower,
[01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:06.560]   especially in a short amount of time,
[01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:08.980]   and then drops below baseline.
[01:05:08.980 --> 01:05:10.560]   There are tools and techniques that you can use
[01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:12.520]   to elevate your baseline level of dopamine
[01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:14.640]   for long periods of time.
[01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:18.300]   And here, again, this is done in addition
[01:05:18.300 --> 01:05:21.080]   to the basic tools that I mentioned a few moments ago.
[01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:24.320]   The simplest one for which there are excellent data,
[01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:25.700]   and here I'm referring to data published
[01:05:25.700 --> 01:05:27.400]   in the European Journal of Physiology,
[01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:28.880]   I'll provide a link to this,
[01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:33.880]   is that exposure of your body up to the neck to cold water,
[01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:37.480]   and it doesn't have to be super cold, by the way,
[01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:40.480]   to cold water has been shown to increase baseline levels
[01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:43.120]   of dopamine and the other so-called catecholamines,
[01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:45.160]   which include norepinephrine and epinephrine,
[01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:49.600]   but for sake of today's discussion, dopamine in particular,
[01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:52.980]   for not just one, but at least two,
[01:05:52.980 --> 01:05:55.360]   and probably as long as four or five hours.
[01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:57.760]   There've been some additional scientific studies
[01:05:57.760 --> 01:05:59.840]   after the paper I just mentioned,
[01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:01.440]   and it's really remarkable.
[01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:03.480]   You can accomplish this a number of different ways.
[01:06:03.480 --> 01:06:05.640]   You could get into a cold shower in the morning,
[01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:06.960]   and I do recommend doing this in the morning,
[01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:09.760]   and in that case, it's okay to get the water on your head.
[01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:11.440]   In fact, I recommend it.
[01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:13.140]   You could get into an ice bath.
[01:06:13.140 --> 01:06:14.960]   You could get into a cold plunge.
[01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:16.960]   In these circumstances, I'm not suggesting this
[01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:19.840]   for sake of increasing metabolism or fat loss.
[01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:22.220]   You know, the whole discussion around deliberate cold
[01:06:22.220 --> 01:06:23.560]   and metabolism and fat loss
[01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:25.000]   has become a little bit controversial,
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:26.600]   that we won't go there now,
[01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:29.760]   mostly because we're focused on the clear ability
[01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:32.340]   of deliberate cold exposure to increase dopamine
[01:06:32.340 --> 01:06:35.620]   for long periods of time, aka your dopamine baseline.
[01:06:35.620 --> 01:06:38.420]   The ways to do this vary depending on the temperature.
[01:06:38.420 --> 01:06:41.400]   So for instance, there are data pointing to the fact
[01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:44.100]   that if you want to get a long lasting increase
[01:06:44.100 --> 01:06:45.280]   in your baseline dopamine,
[01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:50.280]   you could take a very cold shower or cold plunge or ice bath
[01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:51.840]   for a very brief period of time,
[01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:54.120]   anywhere from 30 seconds to two minutes,
[01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:56.840]   maybe three minutes, but probably 30 seconds to two minutes.
[01:06:56.840 --> 01:06:58.720]   Now you might ask, what is very cold?
[01:06:58.720 --> 01:06:59.540]   Here I have to be careful
[01:06:59.540 --> 01:07:01.320]   because I don't want to recommend anything
[01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:03.500]   that's going to cause anyone to have a heart attack
[01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:05.660]   or go into shock or anything of that sort.
[01:07:05.660 --> 01:07:09.240]   It's going to vary by person
[01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:11.200]   depending on your level of cold tolerance.
[01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:13.540]   So what I recommend is if you are going
[01:07:13.540 --> 01:07:17.640]   for the short exposure, long dopamine release approach,
[01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:20.080]   that is 30 seconds to two minutes,
[01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:22.360]   that you start warmer than you think you need to,
[01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:25.080]   and then you ease into it over a few days.
[01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:27.660]   But we're really talking about ranges in temperature
[01:07:27.660 --> 01:07:30.760]   from anywhere from about 37 degrees Fahrenheit
[01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:32.880]   to about 55 degrees Fahrenheit.
[01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:37.600]   Again, be careful, approach it with caution and ease into it.
[01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:39.680]   I do recommend doing this early in the day,
[01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:42.160]   and I should mention not after strength
[01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:44.680]   or hypertrophy training because within the six hours
[01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:46.460]   after strength or hypertrophy training,
[01:07:46.460 --> 01:07:47.560]   this deliberate cold exposure,
[01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:48.800]   especially immersion up to the neck,
[01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:52.000]   can suppress the strength and hypertrophy adaptation
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.480]   that the training is designed to accomplish, okay?
[01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:55.680]   So that's one approach.
[01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:58.080]   The other approach that's supported by the literature
[01:07:58.080 --> 01:08:00.260]   to increase baseline levels of dopamine
[01:08:00.260 --> 01:08:01.360]   for very long periods of time,
[01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:03.280]   in fact, this is the original approach,
[01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:06.880]   is to get into warmer water, so not warm, but warmer,
[01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:10.960]   so 60 degree Fahrenheit water up to the neck,
[01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:14.460]   and to stay there for about 45 to 60 minutes.
[01:08:14.460 --> 01:08:17.180]   The reason I don't think most people will do that,
[01:08:17.180 --> 01:08:18.320]   or that most people would prefer
[01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:21.120]   a shorter, colder exposure protocol,
[01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:23.920]   is that most people don't have 45 to 60 minutes each morning
[01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:25.400]   to get into water and sit there.
[01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:26.920]   And in that study, they actually had them sitting
[01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:29.560]   in lawn chairs, basically, in the shallow end of a pool
[01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:31.880]   up to their neck for a full 60 minutes,
[01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:34.160]   and then measuring dopamine release and so forth.
[01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:35.760]   So there are a bunch of different ways to do this.
[01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:37.000]   I should emphasize, I don't think you need
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.520]   to be super precise about the temperature
[01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:40.880]   and even the duration.
[01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:43.600]   What I recommend is find a temperature
[01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:45.120]   that's uncomfortably cold to you,
[01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:47.560]   meaning that you feel agitated and you want to get out,
[01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:49.620]   but that you're confident you can safely stay in.
[01:08:49.620 --> 01:08:52.240]   And again, I can't give a simple prescriptive to everybody,
[01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:54.760]   but this is known to increase baseline levels
[01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:58.480]   of dopamine significantly, in fact, double them or more
[01:08:58.480 --> 01:09:00.520]   for long periods of time, meaning hours,
[01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:02.960]   up to four, maybe even six hours into the day,
[01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:04.560]   which is one of the reasons I suggest doing this
[01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:06.200]   early in the day.
[01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:09.000]   I happen to get into a cold plunge or take a cold shower
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:09.880]   first thing in the morning.
[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:11.800]   I do go outside and get my sunlight first sometimes.
[01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:13.740]   Sometimes I do the cold first.
[01:09:13.740 --> 01:09:15.240]   It really depends on my circumstances
[01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:16.440]   and how I'm feeling that day.
[01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:18.600]   I don't think it really matters which one you do first,
[01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:20.760]   but you want to try and get both of those in early
[01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:22.840]   in the day because you really want the catecholamines
[01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:25.040]   and cortisol elevated early in the day.
[01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:26.500]   Okay, so that's deliberate cold exposure.
[01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:28.360]   We already talked about exercise.
[01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:30.360]   So if you're doing your exercise early in the day,
[01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:32.700]   there's no reason why it couldn't be done in concert
[01:09:32.700 --> 01:09:34.700]   with this deliberate cold exposure.
[01:09:34.700 --> 01:09:36.680]   I recommend doing the deliberate cold exposure first
[01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:39.120]   for the reasons we talked about a few minutes ago.
[01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:40.560]   And then of course, there are compounds,
[01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:42.980]   both prescription and over-the-counter compounds
[01:09:42.980 --> 01:09:45.840]   that can indeed raise your baseline levels of dopamine
[01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:47.600]   for an hour or more.
[01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:48.800]   And when I say an hour or more,
[01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:52.440]   it really depends on individual variation
[01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:56.640]   in terms of how quickly you metabolize dopamine.
[01:09:56.640 --> 01:10:00.120]   And it depends on individual variation in how you manage
[01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:02.120]   or tolerate different dosages of drugs
[01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:03.080]   and different types of drugs.
[01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:04.600]   So the typical drugs,
[01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:07.880]   and here I'm talking about legal prescription drugs
[01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:12.560]   for increasing dopamine are things like Ritalin, Adderall.
[01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:15.960]   Modafinil and armodafinil also tap into this system.
[01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:17.880]   And I did an entire episode about ADHD,
[01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:19.700]   which is the typical context in which you hear
[01:10:19.700 --> 01:10:21.380]   about these prescription drugs.
[01:10:21.380 --> 01:10:23.400]   But assuming it's prescribed by a doctor
[01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:26.840]   for either clinical reasons like ADHD or for other reasons,
[01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:29.320]   all of those compounds do significantly increase
[01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:31.780]   baseline levels of dopamine for many, many hours.
[01:10:31.780 --> 01:10:34.080]   That's absolutely clear and it's one of the major reasons
[01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:35.760]   why those drugs are so effective
[01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:37.840]   in increasing motivation and attention.
[01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:40.040]   Then there are compounds that are sold over-the-counter,
[01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:43.120]   things like amino acids, such as L-tyrosine itself.
[01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:46.520]   That's a very commonly sold and used amino acid.
[01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:49.760]   It's present in a lot of so-called pre-workout formulas.
[01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:50.940]   I, as many of you know,
[01:10:50.940 --> 01:10:54.240]   am a fan of single ingredient supplements for the most part,
[01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:57.280]   aside from foundational supplements like AG1,
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:11:01.200]   which give you many, many micronutrients kind of all together
[01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:02.360]   because it would be nearly impossible
[01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:06.060]   to consume each of those as individual ingredients
[01:11:06.060 --> 01:11:07.700]   and get the right amounts, et cetera.
[01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:09.540]   But for all other supplements,
[01:11:09.540 --> 01:11:12.300]   I'm a big believer in parsing what you need
[01:11:12.300 --> 01:11:14.240]   and what's most effective for you
[01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:16.020]   in single ingredient formulations.
[01:11:16.020 --> 01:11:18.900]   And the typical ways in which people work
[01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:22.000]   to elevate their baseline levels of dopamine
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.460]   with supplements are using either L-tyrosine,
[01:11:24.460 --> 01:11:25.520]   which as I mentioned earlier,
[01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:27.860]   is the rate limiting enzyme for dopamine,
[01:11:27.860 --> 01:11:30.500]   or by using what's called macuna purines,
[01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:32.600]   which is actually very similar to L-dopa,
[01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:34.700]   which is the treatment for Parkinson's.
[01:11:34.700 --> 01:11:36.100]   Macuna purines actually comes
[01:11:36.100 --> 01:11:39.980]   from the velvety outside coating of a certain bean.
[01:11:39.980 --> 01:11:41.060]   I know it sounds really esoteric,
[01:11:41.060 --> 01:11:43.320]   but that's actually where it's found in nature,
[01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:46.420]   and is really 99% L-dopa.
[01:11:46.420 --> 01:11:49.440]   And I confess having tried macuna purines,
[01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:52.600]   having examined the scientific literature on macuna purines,
[01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:55.240]   there is some evidence that it can increase dopamine,
[01:11:55.240 --> 01:11:58.500]   especially in that tuber infundibular pathway,
[01:11:58.500 --> 01:12:01.340]   because it can tap into some of the hormone-related functions
[01:12:01.340 --> 01:12:02.520]   of the pituitary.
[01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:04.780]   It does increase alertness and mood.
[01:12:04.780 --> 01:12:07.860]   It might even increase libido, motivation, et cetera.
[01:12:07.860 --> 01:12:11.240]   But the effects of macuna purines tend to be very much
[01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:13.980]   of the increasing the peak in dopamine,
[01:12:13.980 --> 01:12:16.760]   and then very quickly dropping that peak.
[01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:18.300]   In other words, the peak trough phenomenon,
[01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:21.740]   not for increasing baseline levels of dopamine.
[01:12:21.740 --> 01:12:25.220]   Now, it's likely different for people with Parkinson's
[01:12:25.220 --> 01:12:26.700]   who are taking prescription drugs
[01:12:26.700 --> 01:12:28.180]   that are similar to macuna purines.
[01:12:28.180 --> 01:12:29.380]   So if people have Parkinson's,
[01:12:29.380 --> 01:12:33.320]   oftentimes they are prescribed things like L-dopa,
[01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:36.420]   which is in the pathway to dopamine synthesis.
[01:12:36.420 --> 01:12:39.340]   Or they are prescribed things like bromocriptine,
[01:12:39.340 --> 01:12:42.220]   which will indeed increase dopamine.
[01:12:42.220 --> 01:12:43.740]   And I do realize that some people
[01:12:43.740 --> 01:12:45.660]   use those prescription drugs recreationally,
[01:12:45.660 --> 01:12:47.200]   which I don't recommend.
[01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:50.840]   Those drugs can be used to increase baseline levels
[01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:52.280]   of dopamine, but more typically,
[01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:54.820]   they cause peaks in dopamine and troughs in dopamine,
[01:12:54.820 --> 01:12:57.060]   which is why I do not recommend them.
[01:12:57.060 --> 01:12:59.540]   They are not going to allow you to accomplish what you want
[01:12:59.540 --> 01:13:01.700]   if your goal is more motivation, et cetera.
[01:13:01.700 --> 01:13:04.780]   In fact, they are likely to do the opposite,
[01:13:04.780 --> 01:13:06.560]   give you a big peak in alertness,
[01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:09.420]   and then a crash that can include depressive symptoms
[01:13:09.420 --> 01:13:11.080]   and just not feeling very good.
[01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:13.780]   L-tyrosine, however, has been examined
[01:13:13.780 --> 01:13:15.460]   in the scientific literature,
[01:13:15.460 --> 01:13:18.140]   and at reasonably low dosages,
[01:13:18.140 --> 01:13:20.660]   has been shown to increase circulating
[01:13:20.660 --> 01:13:22.540]   and available levels of dopamine,
[01:13:22.540 --> 01:13:23.820]   both in the brain and body,
[01:13:23.820 --> 01:13:25.980]   and lead to increased cognitive performance,
[01:13:25.980 --> 01:13:27.900]   and in some cases, physical output.
[01:13:27.900 --> 01:13:29.820]   I'll provide links to a few of these studies,
[01:13:29.820 --> 01:13:32.500]   but the two that I really parsed most finely
[01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:33.820]   for sake of this episode,
[01:13:33.820 --> 01:13:36.340]   really just focus on taking L-tyrosine
[01:13:36.340 --> 01:13:38.820]   under conditions where your baseline levels of dopamine
[01:13:38.820 --> 01:13:41.080]   are reduced due to stress,
[01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:43.980]   and under conditions where there's no stress
[01:13:43.980 --> 01:13:45.220]   and people are trying to increase
[01:13:45.220 --> 01:13:46.580]   their baseline levels of dopamine
[01:13:46.580 --> 01:13:48.680]   for sake of improving cognitive function.
[01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:50.060]   The first paper is entitled,
[01:13:50.060 --> 01:13:51.940]   Effect of Tyrosine on Cognitive Function
[01:13:51.940 --> 01:13:54.040]   and Blood Pressure Under Stress.
[01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:56.280]   I'll provide a link to this in the show note captions,
[01:13:56.280 --> 01:13:58.880]   and it's one of many papers, really,
[01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:00.200]   dating back to the early '90s,
[01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:03.480]   exploring how relatively high, frankly,
[01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:05.920]   relatively high dosages of L-tyrosine
[01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:07.940]   taken under conditions of stress
[01:14:07.940 --> 01:14:10.880]   allow people to rescue some of their cognitive function
[01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:12.420]   in terms of working memory tasks
[01:14:12.420 --> 01:14:13.660]   and other kind of cognitive tasks,
[01:14:13.660 --> 01:14:16.660]   visual pursuit tasks, and so on.
[01:14:16.660 --> 01:14:18.040]   The second paper is entitled,
[01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:19.580]   Tyrosine Improves Working Memory
[01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:21.200]   in a Multitasking Environment,
[01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:23.320]   and the second paper is perhaps more interesting
[01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:25.020]   because it involves exploring
[01:14:25.020 --> 01:14:27.380]   the use of tyrosine supplementation,
[01:14:27.380 --> 01:14:29.260]   basically taking tyrosine about an hour
[01:14:29.260 --> 01:14:31.780]   before a cognitive task or set of cognitive tasks
[01:14:31.780 --> 01:14:34.340]   that involve a lot of multitasking and working memory.
[01:14:34.340 --> 01:14:36.480]   Working memory, for those of you that don't know,
[01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:39.460]   is your ability to maintain small batches of information
[01:14:39.460 --> 01:14:41.980]   in your mind for relatively short periods of time.
[01:14:41.980 --> 01:14:44.100]   So for instance, if I tell you my phone number,
[01:14:44.100 --> 01:14:46.780]   or the phone number where I grew up, 4932931,
[01:14:46.780 --> 01:14:49.620]   if you can remember that,
[01:14:49.620 --> 01:14:53.000]   chances are you'll remember it for 30 seconds, 60 seconds,
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:54.500]   but that you won't remember it tomorrow
[01:14:54.500 --> 01:14:56.020]   'cause there's really no reason to.
[01:14:56.020 --> 01:14:57.960]   A lot of the tasks that we do throughout the day
[01:14:57.960 --> 01:14:58.920]   involve working memory,
[01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:02.020]   and working memory is very subject to interference
[01:15:02.020 --> 01:15:04.320]   from other tasks that we happen to be doing,
[01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:06.160]   like looking at our phone or having a conversation
[01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:08.220]   or trying to navigate through a city.
[01:15:08.220 --> 01:15:09.900]   It involves a lot of attention,
[01:15:09.900 --> 01:15:13.280]   and this study shows that tyrosine improves working memory,
[01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:16.080]   especially in the context of multitasking
[01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:17.900]   and having a lot of conflicting goals,
[01:15:17.900 --> 01:15:20.660]   and they did a number of really nice experiments here.
[01:15:20.660 --> 01:15:23.180]   It's, again, it's a small study, not that many subjects,
[01:15:23.180 --> 01:15:24.740]   but it's one of several papers.
[01:15:24.740 --> 01:15:26.960]   In fact, this is the paper that kind of set in motion
[01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:29.780]   the domino of other papers exploring the efficacy
[01:15:29.780 --> 01:15:32.040]   of L-tyrosine for cognitive performance.
[01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:34.780]   And they looked at working memory tasks, of course,
[01:15:34.780 --> 01:15:36.600]   but also auditory visual tasks,
[01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:39.280]   and they involve some interference of visual cues
[01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:40.180]   and things of that sort,
[01:15:40.180 --> 01:15:42.360]   and they saw some really interesting effects.
[01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:47.240]   Basically, when we need to attend to multiple things
[01:15:47.240 --> 01:15:50.960]   at the same time, L-tyrosine can help us do that,
[01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:53.300]   at least as it relates to memory.
[01:15:53.300 --> 01:15:54.920]   When I say L-tyrosine, what I really mean
[01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:58.320]   is having your baseline levels of dopamine elevated
[01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:02.200]   can really help navigate multitasking environments,
[01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:04.520]   especially as it relates to working memory,
[01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:06.160]   and this is true under conditions of stress
[01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:09.800]   and under conditions of not stressful, okay?
[01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:11.900]   You might say, "Well, isn't multitasking stressful itself?"
[01:16:11.900 --> 01:16:13.320]   Yes, it can be,
[01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:15.040]   but when we talk about under conditions of stress,
[01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:16.520]   we're talking about people who are sleep-deprived,
[01:16:16.520 --> 01:16:18.160]   we're talking about people that are under
[01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:20.000]   other kinds of psychological or physical stress,
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.300]   L-tyrosine can help in that context as well.
[01:16:22.300 --> 01:16:24.520]   So as I mentioned before, in these studies,
[01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:27.600]   they used very high dosages of L-tyrosine,
[01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:29.760]   so high that actually I don't recommend them.
[01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:31.240]   They did measure stress hormones,
[01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:33.360]   they did measure blood pressure and things of that sort,
[01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:35.880]   but I want to caution you, I do not recommend,
[01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:38.500]   I will say it again, I do not recommend
[01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:42.720]   following the dosages that were used in these two studies
[01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:44.940]   because they are exceedingly high.
[01:16:44.940 --> 01:16:49.340]   They used 100 milligrams per kilogram of body weight
[01:16:49.340 --> 01:16:52.380]   of tyrosine one hour prior to these cognitive tasks.
[01:16:52.380 --> 01:16:55.500]   Now, I weigh about 220 pounds,
[01:16:55.500 --> 01:16:56.860]   I'm a little bit lighter than that,
[01:16:56.860 --> 01:16:59.380]   so that's 100 kilograms approximately.
[01:16:59.380 --> 01:17:01.780]   Translated from this study,
[01:17:01.780 --> 01:17:05.300]   that would mean that had I participated in the study
[01:17:05.300 --> 01:17:07.100]   and I wasn't in the placebo group,
[01:17:07.100 --> 01:17:08.940]   but I was in the L-tyrosine group,
[01:17:08.940 --> 01:17:12.180]   I would have been given 10,000 milligrams of L-tyrosine,
[01:17:12.180 --> 01:17:14.480]   which is 10 grams of L-tyrosine.
[01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:16.420]   I do not recommend that.
[01:17:16.420 --> 01:17:18.200]   In fact, there are papers showing
[01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:21.620]   that as little as 500 milligrams,
[01:17:21.620 --> 01:17:24.680]   but perhaps up to one gram, that is 1,000 milligrams,
[01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:28.140]   or 1,500 milligrams, a gram and a half, of L-tyrosine,
[01:17:28.140 --> 01:17:31.400]   taken 30 to 60 minutes before a cognitive or physical task,
[01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:33.360]   can increase baseline levels of dopamine
[01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:34.860]   for extended periods of time
[01:17:34.860 --> 01:17:36.860]   and thereby improve performance
[01:17:36.860 --> 01:17:39.420]   on those mental or physical tasks.
[01:17:39.420 --> 01:17:41.780]   So if you are somebody who's interested
[01:17:41.780 --> 01:17:43.140]   in trying L-tyrosine,
[01:17:43.140 --> 01:17:45.020]   please know that the increases
[01:17:45.020 --> 01:17:48.920]   in baseline levels of dopamine can be substantial.
[01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:50.100]   They are long lasting,
[01:17:50.100 --> 01:17:53.180]   which qualifies them as baseline increases
[01:17:53.180 --> 01:17:54.340]   as opposed to peaks.
[01:17:54.340 --> 01:17:55.560]   And I would say you should also start
[01:17:55.560 --> 01:17:56.840]   with the lowest possible dose.
[01:17:56.840 --> 01:17:59.880]   So for most people, 250 to 500 milligrams
[01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:01.460]   is going to be a reasonable starting dose
[01:18:01.460 --> 01:18:02.780]   depending on your body weight.
[01:18:02.780 --> 01:18:06.580]   Smaller people start with 250, larger, maybe 500.
[01:18:06.580 --> 01:18:07.960]   Keep an eye on whether or not you're combining it
[01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:09.960]   with caffeine or with any other stimulants.
[01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:11.600]   And keep in mind that, again,
[01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:13.720]   the bigger the peak in dopamine,
[01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:15.840]   the bigger the trough in dopamine afterwards.
[01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:18.200]   So pay attention to whether or not you experience a crash
[01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:19.920]   that same day or the next day.
[01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:20.760]   But chances are,
[01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:23.400]   if you're using a relatively low level of L-tyrosine,
[01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:27.560]   so anywhere from 250, maybe 500 milligrams
[01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:29.720]   or 1,000 milligrams of L-tyrosine
[01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:31.520]   prior to cognitive or physical work
[01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:33.120]   and taken early in the day, by the way,
[01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:34.880]   'cause this can act as a bit of a stimulant,
[01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:37.280]   that you're going to achieve these long lasting increases
[01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:38.740]   in baseline dopamine.
[01:18:38.740 --> 01:18:40.320]   But please also keep in mind
[01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:43.400]   that I always, always suggest
[01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:46.940]   that you engage in the proper behaviors
[01:18:46.940 --> 01:18:49.220]   and you disengage from the improper behaviors
[01:18:49.220 --> 01:18:53.560]   as a first line of offense on any health goal.
[01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:56.160]   So now you know how to set your baseline levels of dopamine
[01:18:56.160 --> 01:18:58.240]   at the highest possible level.
[01:18:58.240 --> 01:18:59.360]   You, of course, want to guard
[01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:02.280]   that baseline level of dopamine very carefully.
[01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:03.120]   So for instance,
[01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:06.280]   you want to avoid any kind of behaviors or substances
[01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:08.920]   that are going to peak your baseline level of dopamine
[01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:11.520]   very high or very sharply,
[01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:14.120]   or if you do engage in those types of behaviors,
[01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:15.400]   whatever they may be,
[01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:17.000]   that you are well aware
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:18.820]   that your baseline level of dopamine
[01:19:18.820 --> 01:19:21.860]   will drop far below what it was
[01:19:21.860 --> 01:19:23.500]   after that peak has fallen.
[01:19:23.500 --> 01:19:26.880]   You will be essentially in the quote unquote trough.
[01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:29.800]   If, however, you find yourself in that trough,
[01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:31.580]   you now have the knowledge to understand
[01:19:31.580 --> 01:19:35.360]   that that trough will resolve if you wait enough time.
[01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:37.400]   That baseline level of dopamine
[01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:38.840]   that you were at prior to the peak
[01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:41.480]   will come back, you will feel better.
[01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:44.100]   However, most people don't know that,
[01:19:44.100 --> 01:19:47.260]   and as a consequence, when they feel that low,
[01:19:47.260 --> 01:19:50.240]   that is, they feel kind of amotivated,
[01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:51.400]   maybe a little bit depressed,
[01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:53.860]   maybe a lot amotivated or a lot depressed,
[01:19:53.860 --> 01:19:56.440]   following some quote unquote peak experience,
[01:19:56.440 --> 01:19:58.820]   what they end up doing
[01:19:58.820 --> 01:20:01.200]   is thinking about what caused that peak experience
[01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:04.840]   and then go back and try to re-engage in the behavior
[01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:07.000]   and try and regenerate that peak experience.
[01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:10.200]   But you now know that that is a terrible strategy.
[01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:13.600]   In fact, that strategy will only lead to diminished peaks
[01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:15.200]   from the same experience.
[01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:17.180]   It will lead to, in many cases,
[01:20:17.180 --> 01:20:20.680]   pursuing more and more intense experiences
[01:20:20.680 --> 01:20:23.520]   to try and recapitulate, recreate that big peak,
[01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:24.640]   which won't work.
[01:20:24.640 --> 01:20:28.400]   Or even worse, people start stacking and combining
[01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:30.720]   different dopamine-increasing behaviors
[01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:34.680]   in order to try and obtain something like that initial peak,
[01:20:34.680 --> 01:20:38.240]   when in fact, all they need to do, all you need to do,
[01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:39.480]   is simply wait,
[01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:42.300]   because the way that the dopamine circuitry is arranged
[01:20:42.300 --> 01:20:44.840]   is that it's not just about pleasure, as you know,
[01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:48.200]   it's about motivation, desire, pursuit, and pleasure,
[01:20:48.200 --> 01:20:52.780]   and it also has everything to do with pain and discomfort.
[01:20:52.780 --> 01:20:54.720]   Now, when people hear the word pain,
[01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:56.560]   they often think, oh, pain, okay,
[01:20:56.560 --> 01:20:59.980]   so a physical pain or an intense emotional pain.
[01:20:59.980 --> 01:21:01.220]   But today we're going to talk about pain
[01:21:01.220 --> 01:21:02.440]   a little bit differently.
[01:21:02.440 --> 01:21:04.420]   We're going to talk about the pain associated
[01:21:04.420 --> 01:21:05.720]   with the trough and dopamine
[01:21:05.720 --> 01:21:08.380]   that occurs after a big peak in dopamine
[01:21:08.380 --> 01:21:13.380]   as a period in which pain and effort go hand in hand.
[01:21:13.380 --> 01:21:14.620]   And I'll return to this in a moment,
[01:21:14.620 --> 01:21:16.520]   but I want you to just note that in your mind,
[01:21:16.520 --> 01:21:18.380]   kind of earmark that in your mind,
[01:21:18.380 --> 01:21:20.220]   because what we're about to talk about
[01:21:20.220 --> 01:21:23.040]   is how to leverage that pain and to use effort
[01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:25.880]   as a way to not just get out of the trough more quickly,
[01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:28.760]   but actually to get back to a higher level of baseline
[01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:30.880]   as you exit that trough.
[01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:33.500]   Meanwhile, I really want to harp on this one point
[01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:34.720]   that I made a moment ago,
[01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:38.120]   which is that after some big experience,
[01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:40.980]   so it could be a vacation or a night out partying
[01:21:40.980 --> 01:21:42.760]   or the birth of a new child,
[01:21:42.760 --> 01:21:44.880]   all of these are well-known phenomena
[01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:48.720]   that lead to troughs or deficits in dopamine afterwards,
[01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:51.080]   which can cause a sort of postpartum depression.
[01:21:51.080 --> 01:21:53.240]   Postpartum depression is a phrase
[01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:56.440]   normally used to describe literally postpartum,
[01:21:56.440 --> 01:21:58.320]   post birth of a child depression.
[01:21:58.320 --> 01:21:59.540]   And that has many causes,
[01:21:59.540 --> 01:22:01.680]   not just related to dopamine baselines,
[01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:03.660]   although it does involve dopamine baselines,
[01:22:03.660 --> 01:22:06.740]   but it has hormonal aspects and other aspects as well.
[01:22:06.740 --> 01:22:10.300]   But postpartum depression is also used to describe
[01:22:10.300 --> 01:22:12.200]   any time that our baseline dopamine
[01:22:12.200 --> 01:22:15.200]   has gone down way, way below what it was
[01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:17.880]   prior to some recent peak or exciting,
[01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:20.780]   exhilarating win or behavior.
[01:22:20.780 --> 01:22:22.600]   A couple of things that one can do
[01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:24.780]   in order to get out of that trough more quickly.
[01:22:24.780 --> 01:22:26.840]   The first one is simply to wait
[01:22:26.840 --> 01:22:29.380]   with the understanding that you will get out.
[01:22:29.380 --> 01:22:30.880]   I know that sounds overly simplistic
[01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:32.740]   and maybe a little bit brutal,
[01:22:32.740 --> 01:22:35.440]   but I think most people don't realize this.
[01:22:35.440 --> 01:22:38.020]   They don't realize that the dopamine circuitry
[01:22:38.020 --> 01:22:39.360]   does take time to replenish,
[01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:41.600]   and it has everything to do with restoring
[01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:43.520]   both the synthesis of dopamine,
[01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:44.360]   as well as what's called
[01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:47.200]   the readily releasable pool of dopamine.
[01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:49.640]   So dopamine is packaged in these little spherical things
[01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:50.520]   that we call vesicles.
[01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:53.720]   Those vesicles are released from the ends of nerves.
[01:22:53.720 --> 01:22:55.620]   So in this case,
[01:22:55.620 --> 01:22:57.400]   we're talking about the nerves that originate,
[01:22:57.400 --> 01:23:00.200]   again, in VTA, a nucleus accumbens,
[01:23:00.200 --> 01:23:02.680]   and send their little wires up to the prefrontal cortex,
[01:23:02.680 --> 01:23:04.800]   and that's where dopamine is released.
[01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:07.280]   And that readily releasable pool of dopamine
[01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:08.520]   takes time to replenish,
[01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:11.720]   and that can take several days in order to replenish.
[01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:14.500]   Just knowing that can help you through that process.
[01:23:14.500 --> 01:23:16.440]   And of course, then it raises the question,
[01:23:16.440 --> 01:23:17.600]   is there anything that you can do
[01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:19.280]   to accelerate that process?
[01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:20.480]   And indeed there is,
[01:23:20.480 --> 01:23:22.460]   and indeed this is what I consider,
[01:23:22.460 --> 01:23:25.360]   not just something to get you out of a trench
[01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:27.520]   of kind of lower mood and motivation,
[01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:31.520]   but actually what represents the holy grail of motivation.
[01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:34.520]   Today, I'm going to talk about this pain effort process
[01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:38.720]   as a very powerful way to get out of sticking points,
[01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:39.960]   but more importantly,
[01:23:39.960 --> 01:23:42.980]   to get into a mode where effort and reward
[01:23:42.980 --> 01:23:45.760]   can actually accelerate your progress
[01:23:45.760 --> 01:23:47.820]   along any path to any goal,
[01:23:47.820 --> 01:23:49.880]   and in a way that you can do it repeatedly.
[01:23:49.880 --> 01:23:52.920]   And this is not simply taking mechanisms from biology
[01:23:52.920 --> 01:23:54.320]   and painting names on them.
[01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:56.800]   Rather, this is leveraging mechanisms in biology
[01:23:56.800 --> 01:23:59.620]   that are well-defined in the animal and human literature
[01:23:59.620 --> 01:24:01.520]   that have parallels to the addiction
[01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:03.680]   and addiction recovery literature,
[01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:06.760]   but that have been shown in specific circumstances
[01:24:06.760 --> 01:24:10.580]   to really allow people to engage in motivational pursuits
[01:24:10.580 --> 01:24:11.800]   in a variety of contexts,
[01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:14.020]   school, relationships, work, et cetera,
[01:24:14.020 --> 01:24:15.240]   in an ongoing way,
[01:24:15.240 --> 01:24:18.120]   and in a way that never depletes their baseline of dopamine
[01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:20.520]   to the point where they have to do a lot of extra work
[01:24:20.520 --> 01:24:21.760]   to get it back,
[01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:24.520]   and in a way that allows them to be really motivated
[01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:26.920]   in a variety of contexts in an adaptive way.
[01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:28.540]   So what we're really talking about here
[01:24:28.540 --> 01:24:30.400]   is regardless of your genetics,
[01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:31.700]   regardless of who your parents are,
[01:24:31.700 --> 01:24:34.400]   which obviously you couldn't select,
[01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:37.640]   being able to leverage your dopamine system
[01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:41.120]   in order to be maximally motivated when you want to be,
[01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:44.260]   and indeed to avoid procrastination.
[01:24:44.260 --> 01:24:46.400]   I'd like to tell you about a classic experiment
[01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:48.420]   that I've described once before on this podcast,
[01:24:48.420 --> 01:24:51.040]   but frankly, this experiment is so crucial,
[01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:53.380]   I don't think it can be described enough.
[01:24:53.380 --> 01:24:56.120]   This was an experiment that was done at Stanford
[01:24:56.120 --> 01:24:58.480]   many years ago and involved children,
[01:24:58.480 --> 01:25:01.360]   but it's actually been repeated in adults.
[01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:03.440]   The experiment involved observing a classroom
[01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:04.400]   of young children,
[01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:06.420]   so these were kids about kindergarten age,
[01:25:06.420 --> 01:25:07.600]   a little bit older,
[01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:10.600]   and observing which activities kids liked to do
[01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:11.820]   in their free time.
[01:25:11.820 --> 01:25:14.000]   So their structured time where they had to,
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:15.560]   these are little kids, so they'd play blocks
[01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:18.180]   or they had to sing or they had to write
[01:25:18.180 --> 01:25:20.520]   or do what they could, or I suppose draw,
[01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:23.900]   they're probably not writing significant prose at that age,
[01:25:23.900 --> 01:25:24.780]   but then they had free time
[01:25:24.780 --> 01:25:26.340]   where they could do whatever they wanted.
[01:25:26.340 --> 01:25:29.340]   And what the researchers did was observe the children
[01:25:29.340 --> 01:25:33.180]   who selected by their own choice to draw pictures.
[01:25:33.180 --> 01:25:35.600]   So there were some tables out with crayons and markers
[01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:36.440]   and paper, et cetera,
[01:25:36.440 --> 01:25:38.440]   and there were some kids that would just naturally go
[01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:39.620]   to that activity every day
[01:25:39.620 --> 01:25:41.500]   'cause they liked that activity.
[01:25:41.500 --> 01:25:44.360]   And they measured how much of the free time
[01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:47.640]   these children elected to use their free time drawing,
[01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:50.100]   doing these different art projects.
[01:25:50.100 --> 01:25:54.760]   And then what they did was they started introducing rewards
[01:25:54.760 --> 01:25:55.600]   to these children.
[01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:58.060]   They started putting a gold star or in some cases,
[01:25:58.060 --> 01:26:00.700]   a silver star on their pieces of artwork
[01:26:00.700 --> 01:26:02.720]   and telling them what a good job they did.
[01:26:02.720 --> 01:26:04.980]   And the kids really liked that.
[01:26:04.980 --> 01:26:06.580]   In fact, who wouldn't, right?
[01:26:06.580 --> 01:26:08.320]   They're not only doing an activity that they like,
[01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:10.460]   but they're also getting a reward for it.
[01:26:10.460 --> 01:26:12.300]   So you can probably see where this is all going.
[01:26:12.300 --> 01:26:14.340]   What they were doing was they were increasing the amount
[01:26:14.340 --> 01:26:17.000]   of dopamine that these children experience.
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.980]   And again, in parallel experiments done with adults,
[01:26:19.980 --> 01:26:22.160]   if you take adults who enjoy a particular activity,
[01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:23.080]   you let them do activity,
[01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:25.280]   and then you start rewarding them for that activity,
[01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:27.620]   especially when you surprise them with a reward
[01:26:27.620 --> 01:26:29.780]   for an activity they already like,
[01:26:29.780 --> 01:26:32.240]   they report that being a much more pleasurable experience
[01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:34.660]   than had they just done the activity.
[01:26:34.660 --> 01:26:36.360]   Then what they did with these children
[01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:39.600]   and in the experiments with adults done later on
[01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:42.600]   was they cease giving them the reward,
[01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:44.920]   and then they observe what percentage of their free time
[01:26:44.920 --> 01:26:48.120]   they spend doing that activity, drawing.
[01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:50.520]   And what they observed was, you guessed it,
[01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:53.180]   a drop in the total amount of time
[01:26:53.180 --> 01:26:55.460]   that the children elected to do this activity
[01:26:55.460 --> 01:26:57.920]   that initially they were doing quite a lot.
[01:26:57.920 --> 01:27:01.740]   In other words, their total satisfaction or desire
[01:27:01.740 --> 01:27:03.720]   or motivation to engage in this activity
[01:27:03.720 --> 01:27:07.160]   dropped below what it was prior to ever receiving a reward.
[01:27:07.160 --> 01:27:09.560]   And again, this has been repeated in a variety of contexts
[01:27:09.560 --> 01:27:11.000]   in different populations, different cultures,
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:14.780]   different countries, men, women, boys, girls,
[01:27:14.780 --> 01:27:16.700]   lots of different backgrounds.
[01:27:16.700 --> 01:27:19.480]   So what this tells us is everything you already know,
[01:27:19.480 --> 01:27:22.060]   which is that reward prediction error
[01:27:22.060 --> 01:27:24.880]   is not just about the desire to do something
[01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:28.080]   and you carrying it out and it being pretty good,
[01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:30.760]   amazing or not good, okay?
[01:27:30.760 --> 01:27:32.440]   I always like to joke that the nervous system
[01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:34.760]   sort of codes things into three bins.
[01:27:34.760 --> 01:27:36.040]   You can think about this in terms of food
[01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:37.480]   or any type of experience.
[01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:39.900]   It can either be yum, yes, I really like that.
[01:27:39.900 --> 01:27:41.660]   Yuck, I really don't like that.
[01:27:41.660 --> 01:27:44.280]   Or meh, it's kind of so-so.
[01:27:44.280 --> 01:27:46.840]   What the scenario led to where rewards were received
[01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:48.780]   for an activity that people already like to do
[01:27:48.780 --> 01:27:51.400]   and then removed was that an activity
[01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:55.900]   that at one point was a yum becomes a meh.
[01:27:55.900 --> 01:28:00.140]   And that all reflects a drop in baseline dopamine, why?
[01:28:00.140 --> 01:28:03.860]   Because the activity that the children or adults liked
[01:28:03.860 --> 01:28:08.860]   combined with the gold star or the monetary reward or praise
[01:28:08.860 --> 01:28:11.180]   that children and adults seem to like
[01:28:11.180 --> 01:28:13.740]   compounded to create a bigger peak in dopamine
[01:28:13.740 --> 01:28:16.740]   and therefore a bigger trough in dopamine.
[01:28:16.740 --> 01:28:18.520]   And if you're already wondering whether or not
[01:28:18.520 --> 01:28:20.140]   their desire to engage in that activity
[01:28:20.140 --> 01:28:22.740]   eventually came back, it did indeed.
[01:28:22.740 --> 01:28:26.300]   So essentially what I described all matches precisely
[01:28:26.300 --> 01:28:28.240]   with dopamine reward prediction error
[01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:29.980]   and the fact that peaks in dopamine
[01:28:29.980 --> 01:28:32.020]   give rise to subsequent troughs in dopamine
[01:28:32.020 --> 01:28:34.060]   that if one waits long enough,
[01:28:34.060 --> 01:28:37.140]   allow baseline levels of dopamine to return to normal.
[01:28:37.140 --> 01:28:40.220]   And of course the amplitude of that dopamine peak
[01:28:40.220 --> 01:28:42.740]   has been varied by giving more money or less money
[01:28:42.740 --> 01:28:43.780]   in different scenarios.
[01:28:43.780 --> 01:28:46.060]   Nearly all the different derivations of the experiments
[01:28:46.060 --> 01:28:47.980]   that you could imagine that map onto
[01:28:47.980 --> 01:28:49.460]   the dynamics of dopamine release
[01:28:49.460 --> 01:28:51.580]   that we've been talking about during this episode
[01:28:51.580 --> 01:28:54.620]   all played out exactly as one would have predicted
[01:28:54.620 --> 01:28:57.540]   based on the neural circuitry and the dynamics of dopamine.
[01:28:57.540 --> 01:28:59.860]   I recommend that you leverage this knowledge
[01:28:59.860 --> 01:29:02.860]   to make sure that any activities that you enjoy to do,
[01:29:02.860 --> 01:29:05.180]   whether or not you enjoy it a little or a lot,
[01:29:05.180 --> 01:29:07.920]   but especially if you enjoy it a lot,
[01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:11.520]   that you guard and protect by making sure
[01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:15.300]   that you don't start layering in or attaching reward
[01:29:15.300 --> 01:29:19.200]   or other sources of dopamine releasing behaviors
[01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:22.080]   or substances to that specific behavior.
[01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:26.540]   Or if you do, that you don't do it terribly often.
[01:29:26.540 --> 01:29:28.020]   Now, how often is terribly often?
[01:29:28.020 --> 01:29:29.080]   We'll get to that in a moment,
[01:29:29.080 --> 01:29:31.140]   but let me give you an example from my life
[01:29:31.140 --> 01:29:34.020]   just as an example, but you will likely have
[01:29:34.020 --> 01:29:36.820]   and you'll know people that will have different examples.
[01:29:36.820 --> 01:29:39.280]   I love to exercise.
[01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:41.880]   I know to some people, this might seem foreign,
[01:29:41.880 --> 01:29:43.540]   but I love to exercise.
[01:29:43.540 --> 01:29:44.940]   I love to do resistance training.
[01:29:44.940 --> 01:29:46.540]   I love to run.
[01:29:46.540 --> 01:29:48.220]   I am not one of those people
[01:29:48.220 --> 01:29:51.220]   that doesn't like the experience of exercising,
[01:29:51.220 --> 01:29:53.620]   but likes the feeling afterwards, quote unquote.
[01:29:53.620 --> 01:29:54.460]   I hear that a lot.
[01:29:54.460 --> 01:29:55.420]   I don't like to exercise,
[01:29:55.420 --> 01:29:57.020]   but I love the way I feel afterwards.
[01:29:57.020 --> 01:29:58.980]   I love physical training
[01:29:58.980 --> 01:30:01.220]   and I love the way I feel afterwards,
[01:30:01.220 --> 01:30:04.020]   but I mostly love the feeling during.
[01:30:04.020 --> 01:30:05.820]   I don't know why I'm wired that way.
[01:30:05.820 --> 01:30:07.460]   I can't say that I'm somebody
[01:30:07.460 --> 01:30:10.000]   who likes to do hard things across the board.
[01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.600]   There are plenty of difficult things in life that I dread
[01:30:12.600 --> 01:30:15.020]   or that I'm sort of meh about,
[01:30:15.020 --> 01:30:17.140]   but for me, hard exercise,
[01:30:17.140 --> 01:30:19.700]   intense exercise of a particular kind,
[01:30:19.700 --> 01:30:23.180]   resistance training and running in particular,
[01:30:23.180 --> 01:30:26.940]   both give me a yum, yes, I love this kind of feeling.
[01:30:26.940 --> 01:30:30.700]   And yes, it persists for me quite a long while afterwards,
[01:30:30.700 --> 01:30:33.160]   both for sake of the way that it changes my neurochemistry,
[01:30:33.160 --> 01:30:34.620]   but also my sense of satisfaction,
[01:30:34.620 --> 01:30:36.860]   but I just simply love it.
[01:30:36.860 --> 01:30:37.820]   Now, years ago,
[01:30:37.820 --> 01:30:41.080]   I discovered that if I drink a cup of black coffee
[01:30:41.080 --> 01:30:45.080]   or an Americano or a double espresso or some yerba mate,
[01:30:45.080 --> 01:30:47.360]   that my workouts can be quite a bit more intense.
[01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:48.860]   I can run further.
[01:30:48.860 --> 01:30:50.440]   And then I also discovered
[01:30:50.440 --> 01:30:53.620]   that if I were to take a pre-workout energy drink
[01:30:53.620 --> 01:30:57.220]   or I took say 300 milligrams of alpha GPC
[01:30:57.220 --> 01:31:00.300]   and 500 milligrams of phenylethylamine
[01:31:00.300 --> 01:31:03.220]   and perhaps even 500 milligrams of L-tyrosine
[01:31:03.220 --> 01:31:05.240]   and perhaps did that alongside the caffeine
[01:31:05.240 --> 01:31:06.300]   and the yerba mate,
[01:31:06.300 --> 01:31:09.460]   then yes, absolutely, I really liked those workouts.
[01:31:09.460 --> 01:31:11.620]   I could be like a laser in terms of focus.
[01:31:11.620 --> 01:31:14.900]   I could exert even more effort, put on some music,
[01:31:14.900 --> 01:31:18.340]   and I could achieve even better performance.
[01:31:18.340 --> 01:31:19.540]   And then I also discovered
[01:31:19.540 --> 01:31:23.960]   that I could export that protocol of caffeine, yerba mate,
[01:31:23.960 --> 01:31:25.860]   and various supplements to my cognitive work.
[01:31:25.860 --> 01:31:27.780]   So when I was studying or writing papers
[01:31:27.780 --> 01:31:29.920]   or writing grants or in the laboratory,
[01:31:29.920 --> 01:31:32.460]   when I was doing experiments with my hands in those days,
[01:31:32.460 --> 01:31:33.880]   cutting brain tissue and staining it
[01:31:33.880 --> 01:31:35.340]   and working really long hours.
[01:31:35.340 --> 01:31:38.620]   And I discovered that all of those things,
[01:31:38.620 --> 01:31:41.820]   all of those behaviors compounded with my love of exercise
[01:31:41.820 --> 01:31:45.940]   and my love of doing science and gave me these big peaks
[01:31:45.940 --> 01:31:49.680]   in what to me felt like even important experiences.
[01:31:49.680 --> 01:31:52.200]   They felt unlike anything else.
[01:31:52.200 --> 01:31:56.820]   They were just so, so peak in their nature, which was great.
[01:31:56.820 --> 01:31:58.960]   And it did indeed enhance my performance.
[01:31:58.960 --> 01:32:02.860]   However, while it did not create a dependency
[01:32:02.860 --> 01:32:05.940]   for those different substances, caffeine,
[01:32:05.940 --> 01:32:10.420]   supplements, et cetera, what I noticed was that in the days
[01:32:10.420 --> 01:32:11.980]   and sometimes weekends afterwards,
[01:32:11.980 --> 01:32:13.500]   even though for much of my career,
[01:32:13.500 --> 01:32:15.460]   I confess I've worked weekends as well,
[01:32:15.460 --> 01:32:17.220]   but I would notice that I'd experienced
[01:32:17.220 --> 01:32:18.900]   a real trough in energy.
[01:32:18.900 --> 01:32:20.820]   I just would not feel that good.
[01:32:20.820 --> 01:32:24.740]   And then if I kept up those behaviors consistently
[01:32:24.740 --> 01:32:27.380]   and I was consistently adding in these other,
[01:32:27.380 --> 01:32:28.420]   let's just call them what they are,
[01:32:28.420 --> 01:32:32.780]   dopamine releasing or stimulating behaviors and substances,
[01:32:32.780 --> 01:32:36.680]   that my enthusiasm for physical training or running
[01:32:36.680 --> 01:32:39.580]   or for doing experiments actually started to diminish.
[01:32:39.580 --> 01:32:41.500]   And this was really discouraging to me at the time
[01:32:41.500 --> 01:32:43.380]   because I started to think, okay, maybe I'm burnt out.
[01:32:43.380 --> 01:32:44.660]   Maybe I have adrenal burnout,
[01:32:44.660 --> 01:32:46.180]   which by the way, doesn't exist, folks.
[01:32:46.180 --> 01:32:47.500]   Your adrenals don't burn out.
[01:32:47.500 --> 01:32:49.920]   There is something called adrenal insufficiency syndrome.
[01:32:49.920 --> 01:32:52.060]   You can overstimulate your system
[01:32:52.060 --> 01:32:55.780]   by way of too much adrenaline, epinephrine and norepinephrine,
[01:32:55.780 --> 01:32:57.120]   but that's a separate thing.
[01:32:57.120 --> 01:33:00.180]   There's no such thing as adrenal burnout per se.
[01:33:00.180 --> 01:33:01.140]   But I didn't know that.
[01:33:01.140 --> 01:33:02.740]   So I thought, gosh, I'm really burnt out.
[01:33:02.740 --> 01:33:06.540]   When in fact, it's now obvious to me what I was doing.
[01:33:06.540 --> 01:33:09.400]   I was combining too many dopamine releasing
[01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:12.060]   or stimulating behaviors and substances
[01:33:12.060 --> 01:33:14.940]   for things that I already enjoy doing as behaviors,
[01:33:14.940 --> 01:33:17.580]   namely exercise and doing experiments,
[01:33:17.580 --> 01:33:20.100]   anything related to science actually.
[01:33:20.100 --> 01:33:24.940]   So what this means is not to avoid taking things
[01:33:24.940 --> 01:33:28.260]   or doing things that amplify your amount of dopamine,
[01:33:28.260 --> 01:33:31.260]   but to be very cautious about how often one does that
[01:33:31.260 --> 01:33:34.380]   and how many different dopamine stimulating behaviors
[01:33:34.380 --> 01:33:36.220]   or compounds one stacks,
[01:33:36.220 --> 01:33:40.100]   especially in terms of taking those things
[01:33:40.100 --> 01:33:43.620]   or stacking those things in and around behaviors
[01:33:43.620 --> 01:33:45.400]   that you already really enjoy doing.
[01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:48.220]   I was essentially just creating another version
[01:33:48.220 --> 01:33:50.860]   of the kids in nursery school or first grade
[01:33:50.860 --> 01:33:53.460]   with the gold star experiment.
[01:33:53.460 --> 01:33:55.740]   I was basically just doing the exact same thing.
[01:33:55.740 --> 01:33:59.680]   And when I realized that and I changed my relationship
[01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:02.820]   to those compounds, I didn't eliminate them all together,
[01:34:02.820 --> 01:34:05.300]   but I started realizing, for instance,
[01:34:05.300 --> 01:34:09.100]   that I didn't need to double up on yerba mate
[01:34:09.100 --> 01:34:10.900]   and coffee every workout.
[01:34:10.900 --> 01:34:13.420]   Sometimes I would do one, sometimes I would do the other.
[01:34:13.420 --> 01:34:15.580]   Frankly, I always do one or the other.
[01:34:15.580 --> 01:34:17.940]   It's rare that I ever do any kind of physical training
[01:34:17.940 --> 01:34:19.220]   without some caffeine first.
[01:34:19.220 --> 01:34:20.620]   And I do my physical training
[01:34:20.620 --> 01:34:21.900]   typically in the early part of the day.
[01:34:21.900 --> 01:34:24.660]   So that's fine, doesn't interfere with my sleep.
[01:34:24.660 --> 01:34:26.420]   I might do a hike without caffeine,
[01:34:26.420 --> 01:34:28.920]   but if I'm in a weight trainer, I'm going to run.
[01:34:28.920 --> 01:34:31.700]   I tend to drink coffee beforehand or have yerba mate.
[01:34:31.700 --> 01:34:36.460]   Or if I occasionally, meaning about once every third,
[01:34:36.460 --> 01:34:39.280]   sometimes every other, but usually about every third workout
[01:34:39.280 --> 01:34:42.380]   I'll take 300 milligrams of alpha-GPC,
[01:34:42.380 --> 01:34:47.220]   maybe occasionally, maybe every third or fourth workout.
[01:34:47.220 --> 01:34:50.420]   And these are resistance workouts, mind you, not running.
[01:34:50.420 --> 01:34:52.340]   I'll take 500 milligrams of L-tyrosine
[01:34:52.340 --> 01:34:55.780]   or more typically 500 milligrams of phenylethylamine.
[01:34:55.780 --> 01:34:58.660]   And very, very rarely, maybe once every two or three months,
[01:34:58.660 --> 01:35:00.580]   I might stack all of those things together
[01:35:00.580 --> 01:35:01.980]   prior to a workout.
[01:35:01.980 --> 01:35:05.780]   But of course, I'm always mindful to also include workouts
[01:35:05.780 --> 01:35:08.340]   or runs or bouts of cognitive work.
[01:35:08.340 --> 01:35:09.460]   So that could be grant writing,
[01:35:09.460 --> 01:35:10.900]   prepping for a podcast, et cetera,
[01:35:10.900 --> 01:35:13.240]   where I don't do anything prior.
[01:35:13.240 --> 01:35:14.500]   Maybe just my caffeine,
[01:35:14.500 --> 01:35:16.020]   because I have a baseline level of caffeine
[01:35:16.020 --> 01:35:19.220]   that I use each day to function like many people.
[01:35:19.220 --> 01:35:20.540]   There's a baseline level of caffeine
[01:35:20.540 --> 01:35:22.280]   that just allows us to function
[01:35:22.280 --> 01:35:23.880]   if we're a perpetual user of caffeine.
[01:35:23.880 --> 01:35:26.540]   I talked a lot about this on the episode in caffeine.
[01:35:26.540 --> 01:35:30.020]   But the key here is be cautious.
[01:35:30.020 --> 01:35:33.740]   I would say be very cautious about stacking and layering
[01:35:33.740 --> 01:35:37.820]   in too many dopamine peak-inducing behaviors
[01:35:37.820 --> 01:35:40.080]   all at once on a regular basis.
[01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:42.020]   The key point here is if you are somebody
[01:35:42.020 --> 01:35:45.180]   that can engage in these intrinsically joyful activities
[01:35:45.180 --> 01:35:47.380]   for you, these activities that you're really motivated to do
[01:35:47.380 --> 01:35:49.140]   whether or not it's skiing or playing music
[01:35:49.140 --> 01:35:50.580]   or dancing, et cetera,
[01:35:50.580 --> 01:35:53.600]   without the need to layer in additional dopamine
[01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:58.060]   releasing mechanisms or compounds or activities,
[01:35:58.060 --> 01:36:00.200]   well then I highly recommend you do that
[01:36:00.200 --> 01:36:03.300]   because then you are essentially making yourself
[01:36:03.300 --> 01:36:05.140]   one of those fortunate few
[01:36:05.140 --> 01:36:08.740]   that does not require additional stimuli
[01:36:08.740 --> 01:36:11.580]   and therefore can hold on to that pleasure,
[01:36:11.580 --> 01:36:13.980]   can hold on to that intrinsic pleasure and motivation
[01:36:13.980 --> 01:36:16.120]   to engage in these behaviors over time,
[01:36:16.120 --> 01:36:19.340]   which frankly there is no replacement for.
[01:36:19.340 --> 01:36:22.340]   There is no pill or bottle or potion or motivational speech
[01:36:22.340 --> 01:36:27.340]   or podcast or book that can replace intrinsic motivation.
[01:36:27.340 --> 01:36:30.660]   Intrinsic motivation is perhaps the holy grail
[01:36:30.660 --> 01:36:33.080]   of all human endeavors and behaviors
[01:36:33.080 --> 01:36:35.360]   because it encompasses so much of what brought us
[01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:37.180]   to this point in our species evolution
[01:36:37.180 --> 01:36:40.100]   and also what brings each and every one of us
[01:36:40.100 --> 01:36:42.100]   closer and closer to our goals.
[01:36:42.100 --> 01:36:43.620]   And if it's happening with enjoyment
[01:36:43.620 --> 01:36:46.220]   without the need to layer in additional tools,
[01:36:46.220 --> 01:36:49.460]   well then you have really tapped into the source.
[01:36:49.460 --> 01:36:50.500]   And when I say the source,
[01:36:50.500 --> 01:36:52.620]   I don't mean it in any kind of mystical way.
[01:36:52.620 --> 01:36:54.460]   I think it's quite clear by now
[01:36:54.460 --> 01:36:57.560]   that when we hear about chi from Eastern medicine
[01:36:57.560 --> 01:37:00.420]   or we talk about motivation drive and pursuit
[01:37:00.420 --> 01:37:02.940]   in Western neuro-biological languages
[01:37:02.940 --> 01:37:03.980]   that relates to dopamine,
[01:37:03.980 --> 01:37:05.660]   or we hear about the source,
[01:37:05.660 --> 01:37:09.940]   maybe in my podcast episode with the one and only Rick Rubin,
[01:37:09.940 --> 01:37:12.200]   incredibly productive music producer
[01:37:12.200 --> 01:37:15.600]   who's just an unbelievable track record
[01:37:15.600 --> 01:37:17.000]   in terms of creative endeavors,
[01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:18.340]   and he talks about the source,
[01:37:18.340 --> 01:37:20.700]   we're really talking about the same thing,
[01:37:20.700 --> 01:37:22.980]   which is this set of circuits within us
[01:37:22.980 --> 01:37:25.260]   that allow us to identify what we want
[01:37:25.260 --> 01:37:26.700]   and then lean into effort
[01:37:26.700 --> 01:37:28.920]   and then to do that in a persistent way
[01:37:28.920 --> 01:37:30.300]   that allows us to reach our goals.
[01:37:30.300 --> 01:37:33.560]   And if we can do that with an intrinsic sense of pleasure,
[01:37:33.560 --> 01:37:36.460]   well, that is nothing short of magic.
[01:37:36.460 --> 01:37:38.880]   But of course it's not magic, it's science.
[01:37:38.880 --> 01:37:41.460]   And of course, most people are not concerned
[01:37:41.460 --> 01:37:45.200]   about trying to protect the things they already enjoy
[01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:46.820]   in order to make sure that they can continue
[01:37:46.820 --> 01:37:48.740]   to do those things and enjoy them.
[01:37:48.740 --> 01:37:52.540]   Most people are thinking about how they can engage
[01:37:52.540 --> 01:37:56.020]   and pursue things that are less than pleasureful to them,
[01:37:56.020 --> 01:38:00.200]   or how they can continue to engage in motivated behaviors
[01:38:00.200 --> 01:38:03.380]   when the going gets tough, or, and this is a big one,
[01:38:03.380 --> 01:38:04.660]   I hear this over and over again
[01:38:04.660 --> 01:38:06.780]   as a request to cover on this podcast,
[01:38:06.780 --> 01:38:09.940]   how people can overcome procrastination.
[01:38:09.940 --> 01:38:11.040]   What we're going to talk about now
[01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:13.300]   is how the dynamics of dopamine release
[01:38:13.300 --> 01:38:15.120]   that you already are aware of
[01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:18.940]   plus an additional dynamic that we haven't quite talked about
[01:38:18.940 --> 01:38:21.700]   can allow you to leverage dopamine
[01:38:21.700 --> 01:38:24.380]   in a way that really will bring you
[01:38:24.380 --> 01:38:27.740]   to the holy grail of motivation and drive,
[01:38:27.740 --> 01:38:32.740]   which is when effort starts to become the reward itself.
[01:38:32.740 --> 01:38:36.420]   In other words, when friction becomes the reward.
[01:38:36.420 --> 01:38:38.300]   I know that sounds crazy to some of you,
[01:38:38.300 --> 01:38:40.580]   but when friction becomes the reward,
[01:38:40.580 --> 01:38:43.260]   you can pass from an idea and a goal,
[01:38:43.260 --> 01:38:47.880]   no matter how daunting, to successful completion of that goal
[01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:50.900]   while experiencing what essentially will feel like pleasure
[01:38:50.900 --> 01:38:51.940]   the entire time.
[01:38:51.940 --> 01:38:54.780]   Now, that doesn't mean it will be bliss the entire time,
[01:38:54.780 --> 01:38:58.180]   but what is very possible is to leverage the dynamics
[01:38:58.180 --> 01:39:02.080]   of both dopamine peaks and dopamine troughs
[01:39:02.080 --> 01:39:04.880]   in order to not just maintain your baseline level
[01:39:04.880 --> 01:39:07.700]   of dopamine, but to also pull yourself
[01:39:07.700 --> 01:39:09.900]   out of any kind of procrastination
[01:39:09.900 --> 01:39:13.020]   or other kind of overthinking trenches very quickly
[01:39:13.020 --> 01:39:15.460]   and get back into a mode of pursuit.
[01:39:15.460 --> 01:39:17.980]   So how do we make effort the reward?
[01:39:17.980 --> 01:39:19.620]   You may have heard about this in the context
[01:39:19.620 --> 01:39:21.180]   of so-called growth mindset.
[01:39:21.180 --> 01:39:23.780]   Growth mindset is the incredible discovery
[01:39:23.780 --> 01:39:27.860]   and research papers from my colleague, Dr. Carol Dweck
[01:39:27.860 --> 01:39:30.020]   in the psychology department at Stanford.
[01:39:30.020 --> 01:39:31.740]   And there are others such as David Yaeger
[01:39:31.740 --> 01:39:34.060]   at the University of Texas, Austin,
[01:39:34.060 --> 01:39:36.900]   who have leveraged the so-called growth mindset
[01:39:36.900 --> 01:39:41.420]   as a tool that young people and adults alike can use
[01:39:41.420 --> 01:39:43.380]   in order to get better at anything.
[01:39:43.380 --> 01:39:45.900]   And the basic contour of growth mindset
[01:39:45.900 --> 01:39:50.140]   is to adopt the mindset that if you can't do something
[01:39:50.140 --> 01:39:52.340]   or if you can't do it well,
[01:39:52.340 --> 01:39:55.960]   that you can't do it or can't do it well yet.
[01:39:55.960 --> 01:39:57.500]   It's that word yet that's really key.
[01:39:57.500 --> 01:39:59.120]   And there are a number of different tools and techniques
[01:39:59.120 --> 01:40:00.900]   that people use to adopt growth mindset,
[01:40:00.900 --> 01:40:03.740]   but it's all starts with that relationship
[01:40:03.740 --> 01:40:06.500]   to not being able to do it yet.
[01:40:06.500 --> 01:40:09.180]   Now, that all sounds pretty straightforward
[01:40:09.180 --> 01:40:10.460]   when you tell yourself,
[01:40:10.460 --> 01:40:13.360]   but when we are in a performance context,
[01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:16.760]   when we expect ourselves to be able to motivate
[01:40:16.760 --> 01:40:19.140]   or when we expect ourselves to be able to perform
[01:40:19.140 --> 01:40:21.700]   and we can't, that often sets up
[01:40:21.700 --> 01:40:24.380]   a downward spiral of motivation
[01:40:24.380 --> 01:40:27.220]   because we are so used to being attached
[01:40:27.220 --> 01:40:30.300]   to the relationship between desire,
[01:40:30.300 --> 01:40:33.760]   motivation and outcomes, reward prediction error.
[01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:36.460]   We want something, we want that A in class
[01:40:36.460 --> 01:40:37.840]   or we want to learn how to dance
[01:40:37.840 --> 01:40:41.040]   or we want to be able to do this physical skill
[01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:43.440]   of another kind or learn a language
[01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:46.940]   or get the mate we desire or make the relationship work
[01:40:46.940 --> 01:40:49.340]   or make the business work on and on.
[01:40:49.340 --> 01:40:51.600]   And then we get the outcome that we don't want
[01:40:51.600 --> 01:40:54.220]   and our confidence, for lack of a better word,
[01:40:54.220 --> 01:40:55.640]   drops over time.
[01:40:55.640 --> 01:40:58.080]   Oftentimes, that leads to situations
[01:40:58.080 --> 01:41:01.000]   where we are not motivated, we are A motivated.
[01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:02.680]   It can even lead to situations
[01:41:02.680 --> 01:41:04.380]   where we are downright depressed.
[01:41:05.740 --> 01:41:08.740]   There's also circumstances where people,
[01:41:08.740 --> 01:41:11.100]   myself included, of course, procrastinate.
[01:41:11.100 --> 01:41:12.480]   We know we should do something,
[01:41:12.480 --> 01:41:14.080]   but somehow we can't get motivated.
[01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:16.520]   We know that if we put in the effort, we'll get there,
[01:41:16.520 --> 01:41:17.840]   but we can't do it either
[01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:19.120]   because we don't like the activity
[01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:20.760]   or we're just not feeling great.
[01:41:20.760 --> 01:41:23.600]   Now we could be quote unquote, not feeling great,
[01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:26.500]   not feeling motivated because our dopamine baseline is low.
[01:41:26.500 --> 01:41:29.600]   And so I absolutely encourage everybody
[01:41:29.600 --> 01:41:31.300]   to take a look at themselves
[01:41:31.300 --> 01:41:33.180]   anytime they're in a motivated state,
[01:41:33.180 --> 01:41:34.920]   take a look at the landscape of their life,
[01:41:34.920 --> 01:41:36.040]   not just at that moment,
[01:41:36.040 --> 01:41:38.720]   but in the preceding days and weeks,
[01:41:38.720 --> 01:41:40.620]   and ask whether or not you've been tending
[01:41:40.620 --> 01:41:42.740]   to those foundational things that we talked about earlier,
[01:41:42.740 --> 01:41:46.260]   whether or not you are engaging any other of the tools
[01:41:46.260 --> 01:41:47.180]   that we talked about earlier
[01:41:47.180 --> 01:41:49.640]   to see if you can get into a motivated state.
[01:41:49.640 --> 01:41:51.560]   However, if all of those boxes are checked,
[01:41:51.560 --> 01:41:52.980]   you answer, yes, I'm doing all those things,
[01:41:52.980 --> 01:41:54.680]   I'm just not motivated, or I'm just,
[01:41:54.680 --> 01:41:56.880]   for whatever reason, I just procrastinate.
[01:41:56.880 --> 01:41:58.140]   I don't know, I don't want to do it,
[01:41:58.140 --> 01:41:59.960]   or I'm not feeling motivated.
[01:41:59.960 --> 01:42:02.100]   Well, then there's a very potent set of tools
[01:42:02.100 --> 01:42:05.160]   that you can leverage to overcome states of lack
[01:42:05.160 --> 01:42:07.540]   of motivation, overcome procrastination,
[01:42:07.540 --> 01:42:10.780]   and indeed can help you deal with things like overthinking
[01:42:10.780 --> 01:42:12.260]   as it relates to procrastination
[01:42:12.260 --> 01:42:14.180]   and lack of motivation as well.
[01:42:14.180 --> 01:42:16.580]   So the way this works is the following.
[01:42:16.580 --> 01:42:19.620]   If you recall, a peak in dopamine
[01:42:19.620 --> 01:42:21.840]   is followed by a trough in dopamine.
[01:42:21.840 --> 01:42:24.940]   That trough in dopamine is experienced
[01:42:24.940 --> 01:42:29.080]   as pain or wanting or craving.
[01:42:29.080 --> 01:42:30.640]   That pain that I'm referring to
[01:42:30.640 --> 01:42:33.340]   is actually a craving or a wanting,
[01:42:33.340 --> 01:42:37.700]   and it's a craving or wanting for a specific state
[01:42:37.700 --> 01:42:39.440]   that you would like to achieve
[01:42:39.440 --> 01:42:40.840]   that is different than the one that you're in.
[01:42:40.840 --> 01:42:42.880]   You want to get out of that trough.
[01:42:42.880 --> 01:42:45.160]   And as you recall from earlier in the episode,
[01:42:45.160 --> 01:42:47.820]   that trough is the stimulus
[01:42:47.820 --> 01:42:49.780]   for the ongoing release of dopamine
[01:42:49.780 --> 01:42:51.460]   that provides the propeller,
[01:42:51.460 --> 01:42:55.920]   the motivation to go forward and seek some goal, okay?
[01:42:55.920 --> 01:42:57.440]   So when we are not motivated,
[01:42:57.440 --> 01:43:00.500]   when we are in a so-called amotivated state,
[01:43:00.500 --> 01:43:02.000]   or when we are procrastinating,
[01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.960]   or when we just sort of can't seem to get in gear,
[01:43:04.960 --> 01:43:07.820]   the key to getting out of that pain trough
[01:43:07.820 --> 01:43:08.800]   is one of two things.
[01:43:08.800 --> 01:43:10.880]   I already told you earlier, you can just wait,
[01:43:10.880 --> 01:43:12.500]   can wait till your motivation comes back,
[01:43:12.500 --> 01:43:13.880]   and a lot of people do wait.
[01:43:13.880 --> 01:43:15.620]   In fact, they procrastinate.
[01:43:15.620 --> 01:43:18.760]   They start doing other things that are less painful
[01:43:18.760 --> 01:43:21.320]   than the state that they happen to be in
[01:43:21.320 --> 01:43:23.960]   when they are trying to get into gear to go work out,
[01:43:23.960 --> 01:43:25.600]   'cause I realize not everyone wants to do that,
[01:43:25.600 --> 01:43:28.540]   or to study or to have a hard conversation,
[01:43:28.540 --> 01:43:30.060]   it's whatever it is.
[01:43:30.060 --> 01:43:30.900]   And what do they do?
[01:43:30.900 --> 01:43:33.360]   They start engaging in activities that we,
[01:43:33.360 --> 01:43:37.040]   and indeed they, would not consider pleasureful activities.
[01:43:37.040 --> 01:43:39.080]   They start, for instance, cleaning the house.
[01:43:39.080 --> 01:43:40.380]   So seemingly out of nowhere,
[01:43:40.380 --> 01:43:42.000]   they start engaging in these activities
[01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.940]   that normally are not intrinsically pleasureful for them,
[01:43:44.940 --> 01:43:46.720]   they're not highly motivated to do them,
[01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:49.320]   as a replacement for doing the very thing
[01:43:49.320 --> 01:43:51.880]   that they quote unquote need to do or ought to do,
[01:43:51.880 --> 01:43:54.440]   and that they're procrastinating to do.
[01:43:54.440 --> 01:43:56.000]   What they're essentially doing here
[01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:59.840]   is a mild type of addiction replacement.
[01:43:59.840 --> 01:44:03.100]   In other words, rather than be in the painful state
[01:44:03.100 --> 01:44:04.580]   and wait for it to pass,
[01:44:04.580 --> 01:44:05.800]   they're doing things that give them
[01:44:05.800 --> 01:44:08.640]   some sense of accomplishment ostensibly
[01:44:08.640 --> 01:44:11.660]   to give them the sense that they're completing things.
[01:44:11.660 --> 01:44:13.480]   And perhaps, and I don't know,
[01:44:13.480 --> 01:44:15.520]   because I'm not in the psychology
[01:44:15.520 --> 01:44:17.900]   of knowing what other people are thinking,
[01:44:17.900 --> 01:44:20.120]   perhaps in order to generate the momentum
[01:44:20.120 --> 01:44:23.380]   in order to get engaged enough or motivated enough
[01:44:23.380 --> 01:44:25.520]   to study or work out or whatever activity it is
[01:44:25.520 --> 01:44:28.440]   that they're trying to avoid through procrastination.
[01:44:28.440 --> 01:44:30.800]   Now, what's interesting about this dynamic
[01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:34.240]   is first of all, it's extremely common.
[01:44:34.240 --> 01:44:37.440]   And second of all, a lot of people will use this as a tactic
[01:44:37.440 --> 01:44:39.880]   so that they get very close to the deadline
[01:44:39.880 --> 01:44:40.760]   to complete something,
[01:44:40.760 --> 01:44:43.560]   and then they go into a sort of pseudo panic
[01:44:43.560 --> 01:44:46.120]   and then use anxiety as a way
[01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:48.800]   to leverage their mental and physical resources
[01:44:48.800 --> 01:44:50.340]   to complete that thing.
[01:44:50.340 --> 01:44:52.720]   How do I know the contour of this so well?
[01:44:52.720 --> 01:44:54.860]   How do I understand the inner dynamics of it?
[01:44:54.860 --> 01:44:57.460]   Well, part of that relates to my work as a neurobiologist
[01:44:57.460 --> 01:45:00.280]   and reading the papers that I'll mention to you in a moment,
[01:45:00.280 --> 01:45:02.560]   but it also relates to the fact that I'm somebody
[01:45:02.560 --> 01:45:05.060]   who waits quite a while,
[01:45:05.060 --> 01:45:08.320]   right up until the sort of last minute possible
[01:45:08.320 --> 01:45:11.180]   to complete something for activities that I don't want to do,
[01:45:11.180 --> 01:45:13.320]   something I've been working on my whole life.
[01:45:13.320 --> 01:45:14.680]   In any case, I'm very familiar
[01:45:14.680 --> 01:45:17.040]   with the procrastination process.
[01:45:17.040 --> 01:45:19.320]   So how can we overcome procrastination?
[01:45:19.320 --> 01:45:20.600]   Well, it turns out that there are findings
[01:45:20.600 --> 01:45:22.660]   from within the addiction literature
[01:45:22.660 --> 01:45:24.340]   that turn out to be very powerful
[01:45:24.340 --> 01:45:27.280]   towards leveraging our way out of procrastination.
[01:45:27.280 --> 01:45:29.120]   And it has to do with this.
[01:45:29.120 --> 01:45:31.140]   You already know,
[01:45:31.140 --> 01:45:33.380]   because I've told you probably a dozen times now,
[01:45:33.380 --> 01:45:37.480]   that the depth of the trough after a dopamine peak
[01:45:37.480 --> 01:45:39.400]   is proportional to how high that peak was
[01:45:39.400 --> 01:45:42.680]   and how steep it was, how quickly that peak occurred.
[01:45:42.680 --> 01:45:45.140]   It turns out that not only is the depth of the trough
[01:45:45.140 --> 01:45:46.520]   proportional to that,
[01:45:46.520 --> 01:45:50.320]   but the rate at which you get out of that trough
[01:45:50.320 --> 01:45:53.740]   is proportional to how steep that trough is.
[01:45:54.680 --> 01:45:56.000]   Let me explain this for you
[01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.880]   in as clear terms as I possibly can.
[01:45:58.880 --> 01:46:01.280]   Imagine you're in an amotivated state,
[01:46:01.280 --> 01:46:04.640]   you're just not feeling motivated, you're procrastinating.
[01:46:04.640 --> 01:46:08.600]   You may think, okay, the thing to do here is something,
[01:46:08.600 --> 01:46:10.560]   I'll clean the house, I'll take care of some bills,
[01:46:10.560 --> 01:46:13.320]   I'll do something, or I'll just wait.
[01:46:13.320 --> 01:46:16.000]   Those approaches, as we talked about before,
[01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.640]   generally don't work or at least don't work quickly,
[01:46:18.640 --> 01:46:20.160]   or they lead you right up to the deadline
[01:46:20.160 --> 01:46:21.560]   and that's the deadline that forces you
[01:46:21.560 --> 01:46:23.580]   to get something done, or you just don't get it done
[01:46:23.580 --> 01:46:25.040]   and you don't succeed in your goal.
[01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:26.740]   That happens a lot as well.
[01:46:26.740 --> 01:46:30.260]   However, if you were to take that state
[01:46:30.260 --> 01:46:33.440]   of being unmotivated or procrastinating
[01:46:33.440 --> 01:46:36.900]   and actually do something that's harder
[01:46:36.900 --> 01:46:39.000]   than being in that amotivated state,
[01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:43.160]   in other words, doing something that's more effortful,
[01:46:43.160 --> 01:46:46.680]   even painful, you can rebound yourself
[01:46:46.680 --> 01:46:49.920]   out of that dopamine trough much more quickly.
[01:46:49.920 --> 01:46:51.920]   So what do I mean you want to put yourself in a state
[01:46:51.920 --> 01:46:54.700]   that's worse than or harder than the state that you're in
[01:46:54.700 --> 01:46:56.640]   or do something quote unquote more painful?
[01:46:56.640 --> 01:46:57.820]   And here I want to be very clear.
[01:46:57.820 --> 01:46:58.800]   I'll say this three times,
[01:46:58.800 --> 01:47:00.440]   but I'm going to say it for the first time now.
[01:47:00.440 --> 01:47:02.360]   When I say more painful,
[01:47:02.360 --> 01:47:05.240]   I do not mean doing any kind of tissue damaging
[01:47:05.240 --> 01:47:08.400]   or psychologically damaging behavior
[01:47:08.400 --> 01:47:11.660]   or anything of that sort that's going to render you injured
[01:47:11.660 --> 01:47:13.660]   or not well, even in the short term.
[01:47:13.660 --> 01:47:15.220]   That's not what I'm referring to, okay?
[01:47:15.220 --> 01:47:16.760]   Let's just get that one out of the way.
[01:47:16.760 --> 01:47:19.760]   What I'm referring to is the fact that, for instance,
[01:47:19.760 --> 01:47:22.440]   if you're feeling amotivated, but you find yourself
[01:47:22.440 --> 01:47:25.200]   cleaning the house as a way to procrastinate,
[01:47:25.200 --> 01:47:27.440]   you can say, well, cleaning the house is harder
[01:47:27.440 --> 01:47:29.880]   than sitting down and doing nothing,
[01:47:29.880 --> 01:47:32.960]   but actually in that moment or in those moments,
[01:47:32.960 --> 01:47:36.680]   that's not the case or else you wouldn't be doing it.
[01:47:36.680 --> 01:47:40.880]   The reality is that the dopamine system works
[01:47:40.880 --> 01:47:44.540]   according to what feels hard or easy in the moment.
[01:47:44.540 --> 01:47:46.940]   In other words, if you're feeling amotivated,
[01:47:46.940 --> 01:47:50.360]   you need to do something and put yourself into a state
[01:47:50.360 --> 01:47:53.480]   that's harder than the state you're in.
[01:47:53.480 --> 01:47:55.720]   So for instance, if you're sitting around
[01:47:55.720 --> 01:47:59.380]   feeling amotivated or you find yourself tending to tasks
[01:47:59.380 --> 01:48:00.660]   that are irrelevant to the goal
[01:48:00.660 --> 01:48:03.100]   that you really should be focused on,
[01:48:03.100 --> 01:48:05.220]   you need to put your body and mind
[01:48:05.220 --> 01:48:08.520]   into a state of discomfort quickly.
[01:48:08.520 --> 01:48:11.520]   And the way to do that is to either engage
[01:48:11.520 --> 01:48:14.220]   in some tangential activity,
[01:48:14.220 --> 01:48:16.160]   meaning an activity not related to your goal
[01:48:16.160 --> 01:48:18.580]   that puts your body into a very different state.
[01:48:18.580 --> 01:48:20.600]   So here again, I'll default to the obvious one,
[01:48:20.600 --> 01:48:24.880]   which is something like cold shower or cold immersion,
[01:48:24.880 --> 01:48:27.580]   which not only increases dopamine long-term
[01:48:27.580 --> 01:48:29.260]   or over several hours rather,
[01:48:29.260 --> 01:48:32.420]   but for most people is experienced as pain.
[01:48:32.420 --> 01:48:35.720]   That pain causes a rebound out of that dopamine trough
[01:48:35.720 --> 01:48:37.700]   faster than it would occur
[01:48:37.700 --> 01:48:39.720]   if you had just stayed in that amotivated state
[01:48:39.720 --> 01:48:40.800]   and waited for it to go away
[01:48:40.800 --> 01:48:43.080]   or done something like cleaning up
[01:48:43.080 --> 01:48:45.280]   that for whatever reason felt like it required
[01:48:45.280 --> 01:48:46.740]   less friction.
[01:48:46.740 --> 01:48:48.660]   When I say friction, I mean limbic friction.
[01:48:48.660 --> 01:48:50.660]   Your limbic system is always in this dialogue
[01:48:50.660 --> 01:48:54.180]   with your forebrain and limbic friction goes two ways.
[01:48:54.180 --> 01:48:55.860]   Limbic friction can be you're tired
[01:48:55.860 --> 01:48:57.820]   and you don't want to do something.
[01:48:57.820 --> 01:49:00.680]   And so you have to quote unquote, motivate to do it,
[01:49:00.680 --> 01:49:02.300]   energize yourself to do it.
[01:49:02.300 --> 01:49:05.740]   Or limbic friction can be that you're nervous and scared
[01:49:05.740 --> 01:49:06.820]   and anxious to do something
[01:49:06.820 --> 01:49:09.020]   and you have to calm yourself in order to lean forward
[01:49:09.020 --> 01:49:12.340]   into action in order to do that thing despite the anxiety.
[01:49:12.340 --> 01:49:14.440]   I realize this can be a little bit confusing as a concept.
[01:49:14.440 --> 01:49:15.960]   So I want to go into a bit more detail.
[01:49:15.960 --> 01:49:19.260]   Let's imagine that you or somebody else
[01:49:19.260 --> 01:49:20.660]   does not like to exercise.
[01:49:20.660 --> 01:49:21.620]   You don't want to exercise
[01:49:21.620 --> 01:49:22.900]   and you're trying to get your minimum
[01:49:22.900 --> 01:49:25.160]   of five days per week exercise
[01:49:25.160 --> 01:49:27.740]   and you're just not motivated to do it.
[01:49:27.740 --> 01:49:30.220]   There are a couple of different techniques to doing this.
[01:49:30.220 --> 01:49:32.820]   Assuming you've taken care of all the baseline stuff,
[01:49:32.820 --> 01:49:34.980]   all the foundational stuff we talked about earlier,
[01:49:34.980 --> 01:49:36.340]   and you're just not getting in gear
[01:49:36.340 --> 01:49:38.660]   and you find yourself checking your phone
[01:49:38.660 --> 01:49:40.820]   or maybe you're tending to some tasks.
[01:49:40.820 --> 01:49:43.700]   Obviously those things are quote unquote, easier for you.
[01:49:43.700 --> 01:49:47.040]   Meaning they cause less limbic friction
[01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:49.140]   than engaging in exercise.
[01:49:49.140 --> 01:49:54.800]   The typical advice would be just exercise for one minute.
[01:49:54.800 --> 01:49:57.260]   Okay, just get one minute of exercise or five minutes
[01:49:57.260 --> 01:50:00.280]   and then use the successful completion
[01:50:00.280 --> 01:50:02.220]   of that one or five minutes as a milestone
[01:50:02.220 --> 01:50:04.520]   that allows you to then move to the next milestone.
[01:50:04.520 --> 01:50:06.500]   And indeed that approach can work.
[01:50:06.500 --> 01:50:08.460]   And it's exactly what I'm describing here
[01:50:08.460 --> 01:50:12.360]   when I say that you're in a state of lack of motivation
[01:50:12.360 --> 01:50:14.400]   or procrastination or both.
[01:50:14.400 --> 01:50:18.480]   And you need to put yourself into a more painful,
[01:50:18.480 --> 01:50:19.540]   not less painful state.
[01:50:19.540 --> 01:50:20.380]   So what do you do?
[01:50:20.380 --> 01:50:23.220]   You push up against that friction
[01:50:23.220 --> 01:50:25.580]   and you exercise for a short while
[01:50:25.580 --> 01:50:28.460]   and then that pops you out of that trough.
[01:50:28.460 --> 01:50:30.820]   That's possible, but for a lot of people,
[01:50:30.820 --> 01:50:32.200]   even that won't be possible
[01:50:32.200 --> 01:50:33.540]   because they just can't get motivated
[01:50:33.540 --> 01:50:34.920]   or they do that one minute or five minutes
[01:50:34.920 --> 01:50:37.100]   and they're just like, okay, I'm still in the trough.
[01:50:37.100 --> 01:50:38.900]   I'm not actually feeling that great.
[01:50:38.900 --> 01:50:41.180]   In those circumstances,
[01:50:41.180 --> 01:50:43.560]   it makes sense to do something that's tangential
[01:50:43.560 --> 01:50:45.680]   to the whole path that you're trying to pursue,
[01:50:45.680 --> 01:50:48.080]   this goal that you're trying to pursue.
[01:50:48.080 --> 01:50:49.520]   That is, believe it or not,
[01:50:49.520 --> 01:50:52.160]   much worse than just being a motivated.
[01:50:52.160 --> 01:50:55.460]   And when I say worse, I don't mean picking some task
[01:50:55.460 --> 01:50:56.960]   that normally you don't like to do,
[01:50:56.960 --> 01:50:58.300]   but now you're willing to do.
[01:50:58.300 --> 01:51:01.740]   I mean, literally thinking about what would be worse
[01:51:01.740 --> 01:51:03.400]   than being in this state?
[01:51:03.400 --> 01:51:04.980]   Again, without causing yourself tissue
[01:51:04.980 --> 01:51:07.480]   or psychological damage, what would be worse?
[01:51:07.480 --> 01:51:10.460]   Well, cold water would be worse for many people,
[01:51:10.460 --> 01:51:11.720]   very cold water.
[01:51:11.720 --> 01:51:14.340]   So the key is to figure out something that,
[01:51:14.340 --> 01:51:17.220]   for lack of a better way to put it, really sucks,
[01:51:17.220 --> 01:51:19.580]   really sucks, and yet is safe.
[01:51:19.580 --> 01:51:23.600]   And by doing that, you steepen the trough,
[01:51:23.600 --> 01:51:26.500]   you steepen the slope of the trough,
[01:51:26.500 --> 01:51:28.700]   which we know brings you back
[01:51:28.700 --> 01:51:31.420]   to your baseline level of dopamine more quickly.
[01:51:31.420 --> 01:51:33.820]   Now, for some people, that will be deliberate cold exposure
[01:51:33.820 --> 01:51:35.080]   through cold shower, ice bath.
[01:51:35.080 --> 01:51:36.540]   And I have to tell you that if you're cringing
[01:51:36.540 --> 01:51:38.940]   as I say this, well, then there you go.
[01:51:38.940 --> 01:51:42.180]   You now have a tool that you know you cringe
[01:51:42.180 --> 01:51:44.100]   even when you just think about,
[01:51:44.100 --> 01:51:46.480]   and therefore represents a great tool for you.
[01:51:46.480 --> 01:51:48.220]   So if I'm procrastinating to do something
[01:51:48.220 --> 01:51:50.820]   I really need to do, should I just simply wait
[01:51:50.820 --> 01:51:52.820]   for that procrastination to evaporate?
[01:51:52.820 --> 01:51:53.660]   No.
[01:51:53.660 --> 01:51:54.940]   Will it eventually evaporate?
[01:51:54.940 --> 01:51:55.820]   Maybe.
[01:51:55.820 --> 01:51:58.720]   Will a deadline eventually surface that will trigger me
[01:51:58.720 --> 01:52:01.780]   into an anxious or activated state
[01:52:01.780 --> 01:52:04.260]   that will allow me to complete what needs to be done?
[01:52:04.260 --> 01:52:06.900]   Maybe, hopefully.
[01:52:06.900 --> 01:52:10.260]   But better would be to get out of that amotivated state,
[01:52:10.260 --> 01:52:12.660]   that state of procrastination quickly.
[01:52:12.660 --> 01:52:13.860]   And to do so,
[01:52:13.860 --> 01:52:15.720]   you need to leverage something that's painful.
[01:52:15.720 --> 01:52:18.580]   So for instance, I heard a beautiful lecture recently
[01:52:18.580 --> 01:52:21.580]   done by Dr. Anna Lemke at Stanford School of Medicine
[01:52:21.580 --> 01:52:24.120]   discussing dopamine and some of the things in her book
[01:52:24.120 --> 01:52:26.460]   and some newer findings as well.
[01:52:26.460 --> 01:52:29.060]   And somebody in the audience asked her the question,
[01:52:29.060 --> 01:52:31.660]   does meditation increase dopamine?
[01:52:31.660 --> 01:52:33.900]   Now, earlier we talked about how non-sleep deep rest
[01:52:33.900 --> 01:52:36.620]   and yoga nidra has been shown in the scientific literature
[01:52:36.620 --> 01:52:37.840]   to increase dopamine.
[01:52:37.840 --> 01:52:40.620]   But I also mentioned earlier that classic forms
[01:52:40.620 --> 01:52:43.260]   of meditation, whether eyes open or eyes closed,
[01:52:43.260 --> 01:52:46.700]   so-called open monitoring or closed monitoring meditation,
[01:52:46.700 --> 01:52:48.660]   sitting there or lying there and focusing,
[01:52:48.660 --> 01:52:51.500]   does not increase dopamine levels per se.
[01:52:51.500 --> 01:52:52.940]   However, for most people,
[01:52:52.940 --> 01:52:55.740]   especially people who find it hard to meditate
[01:52:55.740 --> 01:52:57.780]   or who don't do that practice very often,
[01:52:57.780 --> 01:53:01.300]   meditation is effortful.
[01:53:01.300 --> 01:53:04.220]   Getting into meditation and staying in meditation
[01:53:04.220 --> 01:53:05.700]   is effortful.
[01:53:05.700 --> 01:53:08.460]   So if you find yourself in a state of procrastination,
[01:53:08.460 --> 01:53:11.540]   oftentimes a brief five to 10-minute meditation
[01:53:11.540 --> 01:53:14.380]   where you absolutely do not allow yourself to do anything
[01:53:14.380 --> 01:53:17.420]   besides close your eyes, focus on your breath,
[01:53:17.420 --> 01:53:19.780]   and when your mind drifts, get back to your breath,
[01:53:19.780 --> 01:53:23.940]   is not only extremely difficult and extremely frustrating,
[01:53:23.940 --> 01:53:25.940]   unless you're a well-practiced meditator,
[01:53:25.940 --> 01:53:28.820]   but it's often difficult and frustrating not just to do,
[01:53:28.820 --> 01:53:30.420]   but to get into that practice,
[01:53:30.420 --> 01:53:32.180]   and not just to get into that practice,
[01:53:32.180 --> 01:53:33.720]   but to maintain that practice
[01:53:33.720 --> 01:53:35.680]   for that mere five to 10 minutes,
[01:53:35.680 --> 01:53:37.740]   because it's just not a natural state for us to be in.
[01:53:37.740 --> 01:53:39.300]   We have to force ourselves.
[01:53:39.300 --> 01:53:40.880]   So it is effortful.
[01:53:40.880 --> 01:53:44.200]   In fact, it qualifies as a basically available
[01:53:44.200 --> 01:53:47.540]   almost anywhere, anytime type of effortful activity
[01:53:47.540 --> 01:53:49.420]   that if you dislike it,
[01:53:49.420 --> 01:53:51.880]   perhaps even as much as some people dislike
[01:53:51.880 --> 01:53:54.340]   deliberate cold exposure, well then, perfect.
[01:53:54.340 --> 01:53:56.520]   You now have an additional tool in your kit
[01:53:56.520 --> 01:53:58.720]   that you can use anytime you are feeling
[01:53:58.720 --> 01:54:01.360]   amotivated and procrastinating.
[01:54:01.360 --> 01:54:03.200]   Now, there are numerous examples I could give,
[01:54:03.200 --> 01:54:05.020]   and hopefully there are numerous examples
[01:54:05.020 --> 01:54:06.340]   that you're thinking about.
[01:54:06.340 --> 01:54:07.920]   The key is to have a short list
[01:54:07.920 --> 01:54:11.020]   of about five different effortful,
[01:54:11.020 --> 01:54:14.100]   AKA painful activities that you can employ
[01:54:14.100 --> 01:54:16.080]   anytime you're feeling amotivated
[01:54:16.080 --> 01:54:17.880]   or in a state of procrastination,
[01:54:17.880 --> 01:54:21.180]   keeping in mind that the goal is not what you accomplish
[01:54:21.180 --> 01:54:22.460]   inside of that activity,
[01:54:22.460 --> 01:54:23.300]   although it is important
[01:54:23.300 --> 01:54:24.900]   that you actually engage in that activity.
[01:54:24.900 --> 01:54:26.780]   I actually have to make myself meditate
[01:54:26.780 --> 01:54:30.100]   in that five to 10 minute little bout of effortful
[01:54:30.100 --> 01:54:31.540]   or painful activity.
[01:54:31.540 --> 01:54:33.740]   But it's not about achieving an outcome.
[01:54:33.740 --> 01:54:36.180]   It's about forcing your body and mind
[01:54:36.180 --> 01:54:39.460]   into a deeper state of pain and discomfort.
[01:54:39.460 --> 01:54:41.700]   In other words, taking yourself from that trough
[01:54:41.700 --> 01:54:43.740]   that you're already in and steepening
[01:54:43.740 --> 01:54:45.540]   and deepening that trough,
[01:54:45.540 --> 01:54:48.380]   because in steepening and deepening that trough,
[01:54:48.380 --> 01:54:51.520]   we know that the return from that trough
[01:54:51.520 --> 01:54:56.520]   to normal and even elevated levels of baseline dopamine
[01:54:56.520 --> 01:54:59.200]   is going to be faster and more robust.
[01:54:59.200 --> 01:55:02.140]   And in doing that, you will quickly find yourself
[01:55:02.140 --> 01:55:04.160]   back into a motivated state,
[01:55:04.160 --> 01:55:05.660]   because not only does it teach you
[01:55:05.660 --> 01:55:08.200]   that doing hard things is possible,
[01:55:08.200 --> 01:55:11.020]   that's sort of a more of a subjective cognitive learning,
[01:55:11.020 --> 01:55:14.540]   but it actually taps into the very neurochemical system
[01:55:14.540 --> 01:55:17.480]   that allows you to then feel motivated and capable
[01:55:17.480 --> 01:55:18.940]   to pursue the larger goal,
[01:55:18.940 --> 01:55:21.700]   which is the thing you're really concerned about after all.
[01:55:21.700 --> 01:55:23.500]   So as is often the case,
[01:55:23.500 --> 01:55:26.040]   perhaps always the case on this podcast,
[01:55:26.040 --> 01:55:27.900]   we covered a lot of material.
[01:55:27.900 --> 01:55:29.620]   We covered dopamine and what it is.
[01:55:29.620 --> 01:55:31.180]   We talked about the circuitry
[01:55:31.180 --> 01:55:32.820]   and the different kinds of circuitry,
[01:55:32.820 --> 01:55:36.200]   focusing mainly on this mesocortical pathway
[01:55:36.200 --> 01:55:40.860]   that is so vitally important to motivation for any goals.
[01:55:40.860 --> 01:55:43.120]   Talked about the relationship between peaks and troughs
[01:55:43.120 --> 01:55:45.540]   and baselines and the foundational tools
[01:55:45.540 --> 01:55:47.140]   that allow us to set and maintain
[01:55:47.140 --> 01:55:49.240]   a healthy baseline level of dopamine,
[01:55:49.240 --> 01:55:52.460]   as well as ways to protect that baseline level of dopamine.
[01:55:52.460 --> 01:55:53.940]   And we talked about how to get ourselves
[01:55:53.940 --> 01:55:58.100]   out of states of procrastination and a motivation
[01:55:58.100 --> 01:56:01.700]   by not just waiting out those troughs and dopamine,
[01:56:01.700 --> 01:56:05.340]   but actually making those troughs and dopamine steeper
[01:56:05.340 --> 01:56:07.320]   by engaging in things that are effortful
[01:56:07.320 --> 01:56:10.820]   and things that we really don't want to do in those moments,
[01:56:10.820 --> 01:56:13.140]   provided that those things are safe,
[01:56:13.140 --> 01:56:15.900]   we can get out of those dopamine troughs more quickly
[01:56:15.900 --> 01:56:19.740]   and back to our dopamine baseline or even above baseline.
[01:56:19.740 --> 01:56:21.220]   And we talked about what I really view
[01:56:21.220 --> 01:56:23.980]   as the holy grail of motivation,
[01:56:23.980 --> 01:56:26.360]   which is to be able to learn to attach reward
[01:56:26.360 --> 01:56:27.980]   to the effort process itself,
[01:56:27.980 --> 01:56:30.960]   and to do so by not just understanding,
[01:56:30.960 --> 01:56:33.500]   but also learning to subjectively recognize
[01:56:33.500 --> 01:56:35.340]   and somatically experience release
[01:56:35.340 --> 01:56:38.380]   of these different stressful chemicals within our body.
[01:56:38.380 --> 01:56:41.420]   I realize this was a lot of information and yet throughout,
[01:56:41.420 --> 01:56:43.260]   I've tried to highlight tools that you can use
[01:56:43.260 --> 01:56:44.700]   that range from behavioral
[01:56:44.700 --> 01:56:47.780]   to nutritional supplementation tools, cognitive tools.
[01:56:47.780 --> 01:56:50.220]   And keep in mind that all of these different segments
[01:56:50.220 --> 01:56:52.060]   of the podcast is always our timestamp.
[01:56:52.060 --> 01:56:54.160]   So if you feel the need to go back and listen to any of these
[01:56:54.160 --> 01:56:56.540]   in order to get clearer understanding,
[01:56:56.540 --> 01:56:58.300]   we've made that easy to do so.
[01:56:58.300 --> 01:57:01.300]   So simply look for the timestamps in the show note captions.
[01:57:01.300 --> 01:57:03.660]   If you're learning from and or enjoying this podcast,

[01:57:40.500 --> 01:57:42.500]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[01:57:42.500 --> 01:57:46.300]   for things like enhancing sleep, hormone support, focus,
[01:57:46.300 --> 01:57:48.680]   and many other aspects of mental health,
[01:57:48.680 --> 01:57:50.180]   physical health, and performance.
[01:57:50.180 --> 01:57:52.080]   The Huberman Lab Podcast is happy to announce
