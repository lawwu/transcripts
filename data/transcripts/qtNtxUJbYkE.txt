[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   Dan Block, a listener in Kansas City, Missouri, writes in to ask this, "Pastor John, you
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.600]   write a lot of books, you speak often, and your words reach many Christians around the
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.600]   world.
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.840]   But how do you make sure that what you're saying and writing is in line with God's desire,
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.280]   His will, and His heart?
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.880]   You influence so many people.
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.500]   So how do you make sure that your interpretations of God's Word are in line with God's intention?"
[00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.480]   The first thing I do is take this question seriously, and I have taken it seriously for
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.400]   about 50 years, and the reason I take it seriously is because the Bible takes it so seriously.
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:39.640]   A person like me, and I've been this way for a long time, who loves to write and needs
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:47.600]   to write in order to know what I think, and then also loves to share what I've seen and
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:55.520]   what I've discovered with others, a person like that needs to be aware of the warnings
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:01.340]   that the Bible gives about the dangers in front of me, him.
[00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:08.880]   For example, James 3, verse 1, "Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers, for
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:16.160]   you know that we who teach will be judged with greater strictness.
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:22.760]   For we all stumble in many ways, and if anyone does not stumble in what he says, he's a perfect
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.200]   man, able also to bridle his whole body."
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:32.680]   So when James says, "Not many should become teachers," he's admitting God calls some people
[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:39.280]   to open their mouths and explain the Bible and write some things down that might be helpful
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.580]   to other people in understanding God's Word.
[00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.720]   So the point of James 3, verse 1 is not that it's wrong to be a teacher, it's just risky,
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.080]   really risky, and nobody should rush into it.
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.520]   So there's a trembling that this question should give to me and others.
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:03.860]   I've wondered along the way whether the verses in Ecclesiastes and Proverbs should keep me
[00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.720]   from writing and speaking so much.
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.800]   Ecclesiastes 5, 2, "Be not rash with your mouth, nor let your heart be hasty to utter
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.000]   a word before God, for God is in heaven and you are on earth.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Therefore let your words be few."
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.960]   I've written millions of words.
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.360]   That doesn't sound like few.
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.980]   Or Proverbs 10, 19, "When words are many, transgression is not lacking, but whoever
[00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.320]   restrains his lips is prudent."
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.520]   Those passages should give a person like me pause, and they have, but after they have
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:47.720]   given me pause, what I think they mean basically is, in the presence of God, don't think you
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.520]   will be heard or impressive for your many words.
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:59.600]   And in conversations, beware of people who blather away with endless words, who never
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:07.660]   get to the point and create a fog rather than clarity, and dodge the issue with many words
[00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.520]   and smooth talk.
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.520]   Watch out.
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.760]   Don't be one and don't get sucked in by one.
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:21.040]   In other words, the abundance of words in prayer and the abundance of words in conversation
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:28.780]   can be a sign of hypocrisy and that your heart is wrong and something's being hidden.
[00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:37.940]   So my first strategy in answer to the question is beware and be aware of the dangers of speaking
[00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.680]   and writing and teaching.
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:47.640]   Second, I have tried to develop the mindset that measures intuitively, instinctively,
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:54.400]   that measures virtually every truth claim and every attitude by the Bible.
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.880]   I try to treat my mind like a concordance.
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:03.080]   And when I'm faced with a question about what I should think about something or what I should
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:09.660]   feel, I type on the keyboard of my mind relevant words or ideas, and I push the button and
[00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.800]   start the concordance running to see what passages or verses in the scripture will come
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.600]   up that will shed light on this.
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.400]   I get real nervous about people who are so opposed to proof texting.
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.320]   They never think in terms of texts.
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:30.000]   I think exactly the opposite should be drilled into people.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   Test all things, hold fast to what is good.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:40.320]   I don't know any way to test all things except by verses in the Bible that teach truths in
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.320]   the Bible.
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.200]   If you try to abstract truths from the Bible and disconnect them from verses because you're
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.440]   so averse to proof texting, you know what's going to happen?
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.080]   You won't have truth in the end.
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.640]   You'll have vague general ideas that you can massage to fit your own ideas.
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:01.540]   It's verses, it's concrete statements from the Bible that help us.
[00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:07.560]   So I've tried to make my mind a concordance and test everything by the worrying of that
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.760]   hard drive in my brain.
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:17.040]   Third, I've tried to develop over the years a very intense and rigorous and detailed and
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:24.680]   attentive habit of reading scripture closely and carefully, not loosely, flippantly, carelessly
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:32.780]   proof texting my preferences, but really test my thoughts by thinking the thoughts of the
[00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:41.080]   biblical writers after them by a rigorous, intense, close, careful, detailed attention
[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.300]   to the train of thought that they develop in their writing.
[00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:51.780]   Fourth, I've tried to avoid taking positions that are eccentric.
[00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:58.340]   I don't mind using eccentric language like Christian hedonism, but oh, I really abominate
[00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:09.060]   eccentric positions, viewpoints, because I don't think that isolated verses and peculiar
[00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:15.300]   interpretations and eccentric viewpoints are safe.
[00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:20.940]   It is sometimes called the analogy of scripture that I try to follow, meaning that when you
[00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:24.980]   see, you think you see something in the Bible, you test it.
[00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:28.480]   Is it contradicted anywhere else in the Bible?
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:32.940]   Is it a viewpoint that is out of step with the rest of the Bible?
[00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:39.780]   So I've tried to cultivate the habit of not giving verses weird interpretations to support
[00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:44.340]   weird positions that put me on the periphery of Christianity.
[00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:50.980]   I want to stay near the center, which is very much like number five.
[00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:56.900]   I never want to propound any new truth, ever.
[00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:00.980]   I only want to propound old truths.
[00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:08.460]   I am very suspicious of newness and chronological snobbery, C.S. Lewis called it.
[00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:15.640]   The Bible is an old book and it is a sufficient book and it is very likely that any claim
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:23.100]   to new truth, except maybe in the discoveries of the hard sciences, are very likely distortions
[00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:24.100]   of reality.
[00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:31.700]   I love to take my cue from Jeremiah 6.16, "Stand by the roads and look and ask for the
[00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:35.700]   ancient paths where the good way is."
[00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:40.180]   Finally, no, no, next to last, 6.
[00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:46.620]   Over the years and even in these later years, I have tried to surround myself with people
[00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:55.540]   whom I am accountable to morally and in my ideas as well as my attitudes and behaviors.
[00:07:55.540 --> 00:08:02.940]   I don't think anything I write goes public before someone else at Desiring God reads
[00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:09.740]   it except for my tweets, which are almost all straight scripture anyway.
[00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:14.900]   Everything else I write by way of articles or books, I suppose sermons also.
[00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:21.220]   I preach, but then after I preach them, everybody hears them and the guys can call me to account
[00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:23.740]   if I said anything weird.
[00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:28.460]   Before they're posted at the website, they get a rigorous going through by the team at
[00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:30.140]   Desiring God.
[00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:35.820]   Not just wanting to be in sync with history and not do anything new, but wanting to be
[00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:40.500]   tested by responsible, close associates.
[00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:48.660]   The last thing I would say is I pray constantly that God will lead me into truth and in paths
[00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:53.980]   of righteousness and that he will keep my tongue from evil and my lips from speaking
[00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:55.500]   deceit.
[00:08:55.500 --> 00:09:01.740]   Or to use the words of Psalm 19, I pray, "Let the words of my mouth and the meditation
[00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:08.140]   of my heart be acceptable in your sight, O Lord, my rock and my redeemer."
[00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:15.340]   I pray finally often, pretty much every time I go to speak at least, I pray that when anybody
[00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:22.260]   reads or hears me, what I've written, what I've said, they will be given a heart by
[00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:29.820]   the Lord to believe what is true and to be protected from any mistakes I've made.
[00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:30.820]   Amen.
[00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:36.300]   Thank you, Pastor John, for these words on the hazards of Bible interpretation.
