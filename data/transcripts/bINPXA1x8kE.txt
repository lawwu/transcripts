[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.440]   Joseph from Atlanta writes in to ask about James 4,
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.680]   specifically verses nine and 10, which read,
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.700]   "Be miserable and mourn and weep.
[00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.580]   "Let your laughter be turned into mourning
[00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:14.800]   "and your joy to gloom.
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.440]   "Humble yourselves in the presence of the Lord
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.760]   "and he will exalt you."
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:18.880]   End quote.
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.720]   Joseph asks, "It seems rather explicit
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.720]   "that James is saying to not be joyful.
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.000]   "Pastor John, in light of this text,
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.420]   "are there times when the pursuit of joy in God
[00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.720]   "isn't the chief goal in every season of life
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.720]   "or are the two cohesive?"
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.840]   - Oh, that's a sharp observation.
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.480]   I love questions like that.
[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.000]   Anything that helps me take my Christian hedonism deeper
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.080]   to wrestle with seeming contradictions is just great.
[00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.680]   So here we have, how can you say,
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.720]   seek to be happy in God, Piper,
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.440]   and at the same time with the text say,
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.440]   be wretched, mourn, weep, let your joy be turned to gloom.
[00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.820]   That's the opposite of be happy, isn't it?
[00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.020]   Let your joy be turned to gloom.
[00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.840]   So let me just, let's stay with the text.
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.840]   I don't think it's good to run away from texts
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.360]   that feel problematical.
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.360]   Just stay with them.
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.760]   So verse four, he's talking to people who are adulterous.
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.420]   He says, "You adulteresses," it's a feminine, really,
[00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.640]   "You adulteresses, don't you know that friendship
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.560]   "with the world is enmity with God?"
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.720]   So he's talking to people who are finding their joy
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.720]   by using God as their so-called husband to get the money
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.760]   and go out and make friends with the world.
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.760]   They're making a cuckold out of God.
[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.320]   They're cheating on him.
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.880]   And that's the people that are being spoken to.
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.280]   Or verse six, "God opposes the proud,
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.720]   "but gives grace to the humble."
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.580]   So he's talking to proud people.
[00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.200]   Or verse eight, "Cleanse your hands, you sinners.
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.020]   "Purify your hearts, you double-minded."
[00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.740]   And that's back up with these adulterous people.
[00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.420]   They got half the time they're in bed with God
[00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.320]   and half the time they're in bed with the world.
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.060]   They're double-minded.
[00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.220]   So that's the context when he says,
[00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.980]   "Let your laughter be turned to mourning."
[00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.940]   This is not wholesome laughter.
[00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.940]   This is not godly laughter.
[00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.460]   This is the laughter of an unfaithful wife
[00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.900]   in a bar with her boyfriend.
[00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.700]   This is sinful laughter.
[00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.580]   They're laughing behind the backs of the employees
[00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.220]   that they are treating unjustly.
[00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.140]   They're not taking joy in God.
[00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.620]   They're not treasuring God.
[00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.260]   And that's why he calls them adulteresses
[00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.100]   and double-minded.
[00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.700]   So you ask, are there times when,
[00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.460]   I'm seeing Joseph asks,
[00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:57.060]   are there times when the pursuit of joy in God
[00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.300]   isn't the chief goal in every season of life,
[00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.580]   every situation?
[00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.660]   That's a really good question.
[00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.500]   And let's just drop the word chief for a minute
[00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.040]   'cause that's a little ambiguous to me.
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.860]   I'll come back to it.
[00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.520]   There are times, so here's my admission, my concession.
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.960]   Next thing is biblical.
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.560]   There are times when the most immediate goal
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.300]   is stop being happy in the world.
[00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.700]   Stop being happy in sin.
[00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.740]   Start weeping over dishonoring God
[00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.180]   by finding happiness in things.
[00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.700]   That's what the text is saying.
[00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.420]   Yes, right now, stop that happiness.
[00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.980]   Stop that laughter.
[00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.060]   Be brokenhearted.
[00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.440]   Don't rejoice.
[00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.700]   But wouldn't it be true, Joseph,
[00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.420]   that the ultimate aim here,
[00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.380]   the ultimate aim is,
[00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.020]   and maybe I would even say the chief aim,
[00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:00.180]   depending on what you mean by chief,
[00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.860]   the chief goal at this moment
[00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:07.740]   that James is after is not their long-term misery.
[00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:12.020]   He wants them to start honoring God
[00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.140]   by finding pleasure in their husband.
[00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.920]   Get back in bed with your husband and stay there.
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:21.340]   Don't go cheat on God by finding pleasure
[00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.900]   in what he has declared to be sin.
[00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:30.620]   So the pathway to that joy is sorrow,
[00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.280]   and that reminds us of another text, doesn't it?
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.540]   Second Corinthians 7, 10.
[00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.620]   Godly grief produces a repentance
[00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.620]   that leads to salvation.
[00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:44.460]   That's joy.
[00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.940]   And worldly grief produces death.
[00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.640]   So at this point where he says,
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.360]   stop rejoicing, weep, be brokenhearted,
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.900]   don't take joy anymore,
[00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.900]   what he means is start having godly grief for your sin.
[00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.380]   And that leads to repentance,
[00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.580]   and that leads to salvation,
[00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.700]   and salvation is full of joy.
[00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.540]   So even in the summons to be broken,
[00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.660]   the summons to weep,
[00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.120]   he is pursuing our joy.
