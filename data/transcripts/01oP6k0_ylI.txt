[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.840]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:11.560]   the Book of the Acts of the Apostles, in the second chapter, in verses 22 and 23.
[00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:18.120]   Verses 22 and 23, in the second chapter of the Book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.960]   "Ye men of Israel, hear these words.
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:29.520]   Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:37.840]   God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know, him being delivered
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:46.280]   by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken and by wicked hands
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.640]   have crucified and slain."
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:57.680]   We are met together this morning to look at this great, mighty, momentous fact, the death
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:04.320]   of the Lord Jesus Christ upon the cross on Calvary's Hill.
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.960]   We are but a small company.
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:13.280]   There are many similar companies doing this in various parts of the world, and have been
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.480]   doing so regularly for many centuries.
[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.200]   Now the vital question, therefore, for all of us to consider is this.
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.160]   Why do we do this?
[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.880]   What is the meaning of this?
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.320]   We will all agree that we should not do anything simply out of habit or of custom, or simply
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.920]   because it has been done in the past.
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:46.000]   What is the meaning of this day and of this death which took place on a cross on a hill
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.400]   called Calvary, nearly two thousand long years ago?
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.400]   What is its meaning?
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:58.320]   It is essential we should ask the question, because it is obvious to all of us that there
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:07.520]   are many who realize that this, in a sense, has no meaning at all to many people.
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.960]   They talk about Good Friday, but they do not know why it is good.
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.960]   They talk about the death on the cross.
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.360]   They may hold up a cross.
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.060]   They may have a cross in their homes or in their churches.
[00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:26.200]   But if you ask them to tell you what exactly this means, what it represents, they will
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.840]   not be able to tell you.
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:35.080]   There are others who have wrong and false explanations, which are not consistent with
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.400]   the teaching of the holy word of God.
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.760]   Therefore, it is essential that we should consider this.
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:50.260]   I know there is a sense in which, as one looks at and contemplates the cross, one can do
[00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.900]   nothing but stand in amazement and in utter astonishment.
[00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.160]   There is that element.
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.320]   But what I am trying to say is this, that we shall never know that astonishment and
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:09.060]   amazement until we understand something of the meaning.
[00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:16.060]   It is as the result of surveying the wondrous cross that Isaac Watts goes on to say what
[00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.780]   he says in his well-known hymn.
[00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.020]   It was not a casual glance.
[00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.340]   It was not a thoughtless looking.
[00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:31.260]   He surveys it, by which he means that he has been contemplating it and meditating upon
[00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:39.580]   it, and thereby has come to understand something of the richness of its meaning.
[00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.500]   And you and I must do the same thing this morning.
[00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:50.420]   Now according to the first Christian preachers, this event on the cross on Calvary's Hill
[00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:56.740]   is in many ways the most crucial and vital event that has ever happened.
[00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:01.700]   The Apostle Paul in his preaching said that he had determined not to know anything among
[00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.180]   them save Jesus Christ and him crucified.
[00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:13.400]   And it is quite clear that the Apostle Peter here was doing exactly the same thing.
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.860]   To Christian people there is nothing more important than this.
[00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:23.300]   The Apostle again says that the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness.
[00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.620]   Nothing at all, irrelevant, does not mean anything.
[00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.340]   As is the case with so many people in the world today.
[00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.580]   The preaching of the cross to them that perish is foolishness.
[00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:39.780]   But unto us which are saved it is the power of God.
[00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.940]   We preach Christ crucified.
[00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.340]   Unto the Jews a stumbling block.
[00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:46.900]   Unto the Greeks foolishness.
[00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:55.540]   But unto us which are saved, Christ the power of God and Christ the wisdom of God.
[00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:00.700]   Now our question therefore, which we every one of us should ask ourselves at this moment,
[00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.540]   is simply this.
[00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:08.140]   Does the cross mean that to us?
[00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:11.140]   Is it to us everything?
[00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:16.620]   The power of God, the wisdom of God?
[00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.100]   Is it the whole basis of our life this morning?
[00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.460]   Is it the thing on which we rely in every respect?
[00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:31.260]   Can we say that the cross has separated us from everything we ever were?
[00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:39.300]   Can we say this morning that it is this that separates us, crucifies us, from everything
[00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:44.660]   that belongs to and is denoted under the heading of the world?
[00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:49.380]   Well now it is obvious that as this is the way in which it is described by the Apostles
[00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:54.860]   and as it was thus that they preached this, nothing is more important to us who call ourselves
[00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:01.420]   Christians than that we should understand and be able to tell others what exactly was
[00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:07.700]   happening when this blessed person was crucified on that cross on Calvary's hill.
[00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:11.260]   Well very fortunately we need be in no doubt at all about this.
[00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:17.140]   I am calling your attention to these words because we have here the explanation that
[00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:20.180]   was given by the Apostle Peter.
[00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.540]   Now this is most interesting.
[00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:26.980]   This is the first sermon that was ever in a sense preached under the auspices of the
[00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:27.980]   Christian Church.
[00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:33.060]   Here is the Apostle Peter on the day of Pentecost.
[00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:37.020]   The Holy Spirit had just descended upon them.
[00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:43.020]   Before that you remember he and the others were confused, in trouble, did not understand.
[00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:48.380]   But now the Holy Ghost has come and filled with the Holy Ghost they begin to speak in
[00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:54.580]   other tongues and to show unusual manifestations and the crowd gathers together amazed and
[00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:56.300]   astonished saying what is this?
[00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.700]   Some said these men are filled with new wine.
[00:06:58.700 --> 00:06:59.700]   No no says Peter.
[00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:02.340]   And then he begins to preach.
[00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:09.780]   And here he deals in these verses with the meaning of the death of the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:12.780]   on the cross on Calvary's hill.
[00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:15.140]   Here then we have our authority.
[00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:20.140]   What matters is not what you and I may think, not what modern writers may think or say.
[00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:25.100]   The Church is built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets and here is the
[00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:31.180]   leading Apostle preaching the first sermon under the auspices of the Christian Church
[00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:37.740]   and explaining and expounding what exactly it was that happened when Jesus of Nazareth
[00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:41.060]   was crucified on that cross on Calvary's hill.
[00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:42.660]   Here is our authority.
[00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:44.380]   The first great statement.
[00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:46.300]   Let's look at it.
[00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:49.460]   I merely want to comment on it.
[00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:55.820]   The first thing we notice is this, that there is obviously an element of mystery about it.
[00:07:55.820 --> 00:08:02.260]   In other words, you cannot understand the meaning of this cross if you but take a casual
[00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:09.980]   glance at it because there are elements in it that turn it into a mystery.
[00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:12.380]   Our very text suggests this.
[00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:17.500]   Him being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken and
[00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:19.980]   by wicked ends have crucified and slain.
[00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:20.980]   Very well.
[00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:26.860]   At once you see you are face to face with a problem and with a mystery.
[00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:32.820]   And this is the first thing that we should always realize about this cross and about
[00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:36.000]   this death.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:43.400]   You can stand there and look at it as the people did when it took place and you can
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:46.260]   completely misunderstand it.
[00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:51.540]   Indeed it was not only the people, the common people and the Pharisees and the scribes and
[00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:56.220]   the Sadducees and the others who misunderstood it.
[00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:00.340]   The apostles themselves have not understood it.
[00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:05.300]   And this is how you can see very clearly this element of mystery that is involved in the
[00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:07.260]   death on the cross.
[00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:15.180]   You remember how our Lord at Caesarea Philippi had had to rebuke this very apostle Peter.
[00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:19.820]   He had asked his question, "Whom do men say that I am and then whom do ye say that I am?"
[00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:24.380]   Peter stepped forward and said, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God."
[00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:29.500]   And our Lord had commended him and said, "Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-Jonah, for flesh and blood
[00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:33.140]   doth not reveal this unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven."
[00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:35.180]   Peter had acted as spokesman.
[00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:37.980]   He had recognized the person.
[00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:43.660]   But then you remember our Lord had gone on to tell them that he was going to die, that
[00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:47.660]   he was going to be taken and going to be condemned and put to death.
[00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:52.060]   And Peter rebuked him saying, "Far be this from thee, Lord."
[00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:55.740]   The idea that he was going to die was abhorrent.
[00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:59.780]   And our Lord rebuked him saying, "Get thee behind me, Satan, for thou savourest not the
[00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:02.940]   things that be of God, but the things that be of men."
[00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:04.460]   Peter stumbled at this.
[00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:07.020]   He could not understand this person.
[00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:13.060]   And indeed later you will find that every time our Lord referred to his forthcoming
[00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:18.100]   death the disciples, the apostles, were always offended.
[00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:23.060]   And when the time came for him to be arrested, they all forsook him and fled.
[00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:25.780]   And they were as bewildered as everybody else.
[00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:28.980]   They could not understand it.
[00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:35.140]   This was a puzzle to them, a problem, that he who had done such mighty deeds should nevertheless
[00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:40.260]   be taken in utter weakness, condemned, crucified, and there he was dying.
[00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.340]   The apostles had never understood it.
[00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:47.660]   Though they had come to see that he is the Son of God, and though they were his own intimate
[00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:52.980]   followers, they, looking at him dying upon the cross, they did not understand what was
[00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:53.980]   happening.
[00:10:53.980 --> 00:11:00.100]   Very well, there is no need, is there, of further proof of the fact that there is a
[00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:02.180]   mystery about this death.
[00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:07.420]   It doesn't, it isn't simply what it appears to be.
[00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:11.300]   And the fact is that the apostles themselves didn't understand the meaning of the death
[00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:20.620]   upon the cross until after our Lord had arisen again and had appeared to them and had expounded
[00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:24.220]   the meaning of his death himself to them.
[00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:29.180]   You will read the accounts of that in his various appearances after the resurrection.
[00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:31.460]   You remember the two men on the road to Emmaus.
[00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:33.500]   They hadn't understood it.
[00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:37.500]   We had thought, they said, that he was to be the one that was going to deliver us, but
[00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:42.060]   they have taken him and condemned him, and he is dead, and they were utterly disconsolate.
[00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:48.180]   O fools yourselves and slow of heart to understand and to believe all that the prophets have
[00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:53.660]   written, ought not the Christ to have died and suffered these things and enter into his
[00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:54.660]   glory?
[00:11:54.660 --> 00:12:00.060]   And then he took them right through the scriptures, expounding to them the meaning of his death
[00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:01.460]   and how it had to happen.
[00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:04.620]   But the point is that they hadn't understood that.
[00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:10.700]   They'd seen him dying and they'd felt many things, but they didn't know why he died.
[00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:13.340]   They hadn't understood it at all.
[00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:18.820]   And it was only his own exposition of the scriptures after his resurrection that gave
[00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:21.500]   them the enlightening and the understanding.
[00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:27.020]   And then here comes the Holy Ghost upon them, and they see, and Peter preaches it with a
[00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:28.020]   holy boldness.
[00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:30.220]   What am I trying to say?
[00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:33.780]   I'm trying to say this.
[00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:37.700]   Nobody can understand the meaning of this death without the unction and the anointing
[00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:41.020]   of the Holy Ghost.
[00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:44.200]   You can think of this cross and it may make you weep.
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:48.440]   You may like be the daughters of Jerusalem, the women that wept as they saw him staggering
[00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:53.020]   up with the cross heavily upon his shoulder, but that's not to understand it.
[00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:54.020]   He rebuked them.
[00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:58.980]   He said, "Weep not for me, but weep for yourselves."
[00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:03.020]   You can say, "What a wonderful example of passive resistance.
[00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:05.660]   What a protest against war and armaments."
[00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:07.420]   But that doesn't mean you've seen the cross.
[00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:09.380]   You haven't started to see it.
[00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:11.780]   The natural men can never understand this.
[00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:18.300]   There's a mystery here, and it is such a mystery that nothing but the Word of God,
[00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:26.900]   as opened before us to minds enlightened by the Holy Spirit, can possibly understand it.
[00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:31.460]   Very well, my friends, this is a very important first consideration, isn't it?
[00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:34.780]   Have you understood the meaning of the cross?
[00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:37.420]   Have you taken it in its biblical exposition?
[00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:39.900]   Have you had the unction of the Spirit?
[00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:41.380]   Has it been opened to you?
[00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:43.100]   Has the mystery been unraveled?
[00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:50.500]   Well, very well, let's follow the exposition of this enlightened apostle who had been instructed
[00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:55.700]   in the meaning of this death by the risen Lord himself.
[00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:56.700]   What does he say?
[00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:59.700]   Well, he puts it like this.
[00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:04.460]   The first thing that is essential is, of course, that we are clear about the person.
[00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:08.340]   Him, Him.
[00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:13.060]   If we are not clear about the person, we cannot possibly understand his death.
[00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:14.060]   Him.
[00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:15.060]   Who is he?
[00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:20.420]   Well, he says, Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and
[00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:28.620]   signs which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know him.
[00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:35.740]   Being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken.
[00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:38.740]   The person.
[00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:40.660]   I mustn't stay with this this morning.
[00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:46.020]   I have to take this for granted because of lack of time.
[00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:52.660]   But no one can possibly understand this death upon this cross who doesn't know that the
[00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:58.820]   person who was dying was the Son of God.
[00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:01.620]   Peter goes on to refer to him as the Holy One.
[00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:10.780]   He quotes Psalm, "Neither wilt thou suffer thine holy one to see corruption."
[00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:15.340]   This is the one who worked the miracles, miracles, wonders, signs.
[00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:20.500]   The one who raised the dead, the one who calmed the storm, the one to whom nothing seemed
[00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:21.500]   to be impossible.
[00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:22.620]   Here he is.
[00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:25.060]   The signs, the miracles attested.
[00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:26.780]   They proclaim who he is.
[00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:32.660]   He said, "Though ye believe not my words, believe the works."
[00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:37.860]   This is the Son of God.
[00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:41.700]   There is ever the starting point of it all.
[00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:43.660]   This is not only a man.
[00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:47.140]   He is a man, but he is God, God in the flesh.
[00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:48.940]   This Peter says you can't dispute it.
[00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:50.700]   You yourselves also know.
[00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:55.660]   You citizens of Jerusalem, he said, you men of Israel, he preached before you, he worked
[00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:57.420]   his miracles in your presence.
[00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:59.500]   You are witnesses of these things.
[00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:01.140]   There he is proclaiming.
[00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:05.140]   And now, of course, there was something further.
[00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:08.940]   And that was the resurrection.
[00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:14.540]   The final proof to the apostles themselves that he is the Son of God, declared to be
[00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:19.220]   the Son of God with power according to the Spirit of holiness by the resurrection from
[00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:20.940]   the dead.
[00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:26.020]   So this is the first part of the proclamation, that God's own Son has been in this world.
[00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:31.180]   The babe of Bethlehem is the Son of God and the Creator of the universe.
[00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:36.940]   This man, this carpenter, he is not the Son of Joseph, he is the Son of God.
[00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:38.780]   He's the one who was born of a virgin.
[00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:45.980]   He's the one who manifested his glory through his works of power, these amazing things.
[00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:46.980]   Son of God, Him.
[00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:52.580]   Ah, yes, but you see, here's the problem.
[00:16:52.580 --> 00:17:00.220]   The more I emphasize his Godhead and his deity and the miracles and the marvels and the signs,
[00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:02.220]   the more does the mystery increase.
[00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:07.660]   For here he is nailed to a tree.
[00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:09.980]   He is not a weakness.
[00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:12.580]   And he dies.
[00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:16.140]   And his body is taken down and he is buried.
[00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:18.460]   You see, Sir somebody, you're increasing the mystery for me.
[00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:22.500]   The more you emphasize his deity and his Godhead, the more I'm amazed.
[00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:24.380]   And the people were all amazed at this.
[00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:25.380]   Didn't they taunt him with it?
[00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:30.100]   Ah, they said, thou that saidst that thou art the Son of God, come down from the cross,
[00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:31.100]   save thyself.
[00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:34.100]   Thou who savest others, save thyself.
[00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:39.700]   Thou who saidst that thou art the King of Israel, manifest thy power, do something regal.
[00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:41.180]   You're dying in utter weakness.
[00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:44.820]   Now there's the problem, you see.
[00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:53.040]   The more we emphasize the Godhead, the more amazing is this fact that here he is, I say,
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:55.540]   in utter weakness and helplessness.
[00:17:55.540 --> 00:18:00.300]   Crucified, obviously dying.
[00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:05.580]   Expiring into thy hands, I commend my spirit.
[00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:06.580]   And he died.
[00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:10.140]   And the body was taken down and was buried.
[00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:12.740]   Now what is this?
[00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:13.740]   Him?
[00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:14.740]   Son of God?
[00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:17.140]   Why then, why being crucified?
[00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:20.180]   What's the explanation?
[00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:24.540]   Well you look again and you say, well obviously this is the work of men.
[00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:28.660]   You have taken and by wicked hands have crucified and slain.
[00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:34.380]   If there's no problem, says somebody, this is the work of men.
[00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:38.700]   Men are responsible for this, the Jewish crowd cried out, saying, away with him, crucify
[00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:39.700]   him.
[00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:43.900]   Ask for a man called Barabbas, a robber and a thief, to be set free.
[00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:44.900]   Away with this fellow.
[00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:46.980]   No, no, they said we don't want him.
[00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:49.100]   Away with him, crucify him.
[00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:50.820]   They are responsible.
[00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:54.820]   They and these Roman authorities.
[00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:59.020]   Ye have taken and by wicked hands have crucified and slain.
[00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:01.060]   Now we must examine this.
[00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:02.700]   Who does this ye refer to?
[00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:05.580]   Well it refers to the men of Israel whom he's addressing.
[00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:07.820]   Ye men of Israel, hear these words.
[00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:12.580]   Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs which
[00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:18.180]   God did by him in the midst of you, as you yourselves also know him being delivered by
[00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:20.300]   the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of us.
[00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:28.780]   You, you yourselves have taken, the Jews, the leaders of the people, Pharisees, scribes,
[00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:32.460]   Sadducees, doctors of the law, and the common people.
[00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:36.580]   But now we must be perfectly clear as to what Peter is saying about them.
[00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:38.420]   It's a very interesting statement this.
[00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:43.860]   I'm reading the authorized version and it says, ye have taken and by wicked hands have
[00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:45.620]   crucified and slain.
[00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:48.700]   But a better translation is this.
[00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:56.140]   Ye by the hand of lawless men did crucify and slay.
[00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:58.100]   It isn't wicked, it's lawless.
[00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:00.700]   That was the word that the apostle used.
[00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:07.220]   You by the hand of lawless men have crucified and slain.
[00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:09.820]   What does he mean by this lawless men?
[00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:12.860]   Well he is referring of course to Gentiles.
[00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:17.860]   The Gentiles were without the law, they hadn't the law of Moses, so he very rightly calls
[00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:20.200]   them lawless men.
[00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:21.860]   So what he's saying is this.
[00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:27.860]   You through the medium of men who are without the law have taken him and have crucified
[00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:29.500]   and have slain.
[00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:33.300]   In other words Peter here is preaching directly to their consciences.
[00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:38.700]   He says you men of Israel, you Jews, this is what you've done.
[00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:42.300]   You have taken your own Messiah whom God has sent to you.
[00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:45.380]   He prophesied his coming, he sent him at last.
[00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:47.540]   Your own Messiah has come to you.
[00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:54.220]   And you, you yourselves have taken your own Messiah, you've handed him over to these lawless
[00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:59.540]   men, these Romans, this Pontius Pilate.
[00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:05.900]   What a terrible conviction, what a terrible charge to bring against them.
[00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:09.940]   They didn't recognize their own Messiah.
[00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:16.420]   They didn't know their own Saviour, he came unto his own and his own received him not.
[00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:17.420]   This is the tragedy.
[00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:21.100]   Did you notice it in the reading from John 19?
[00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:26.100]   Pilate was trying to hand him back to them but they said we don't want him, we have no
[00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:27.620]   power, we have no authority.
[00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:29.940]   They kept on sending him back to Pilate.
[00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:32.020]   Yes, says Peter, you did it.
[00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:35.500]   You yourselves have handed him over to lawless men.
[00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:41.460]   Your own Messiah has handed him over to these godless, lawless Gentiles.
[00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:44.500]   You've done it yourselves.
[00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:51.420]   He's convicting them of the enormity of their sin.
[00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:56.860]   That was, I say, the great tragedy that these very people who'd been taught throughout the
[00:21:56.860 --> 00:22:04.300]   centuries to look for a coming Messiah failed to know him when he did come and thus dismissed
[00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:12.380]   him, sent him away, handed him over to these lawless men that they might crucify him and
[00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:13.380]   slay him.
[00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:16.660]   Now this word crucify is an interesting one.
[00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:20.260]   It isn't the word that's usually used for crucify.
[00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:25.300]   It's a very special word and it's a word that brings out in a very dramatic manner the idea
[00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:27.780]   of fastening to.
[00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:32.740]   So he deliberately used it to give the impression of the nails being hammered in.
[00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:36.620]   They fastened him, they fastened him to a tree.
[00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:39.680]   He is bringing it home to them that they may feel their guilt.
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:45.580]   He wants them to hear the sound of the hammer hammering every single nail into the body
[00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:50.460]   of their own Holy One, their own Messiah, the Son of God.
[00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:55.980]   You've handed him over to these lawless men and they've fastened him to, they've nailed
[00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:58.340]   him to the cross.
[00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:05.100]   Yes, and this word slay, which means to do away with.
[00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:10.060]   You despised him, said the apostle, you regarded him as but some unworthy fellow.
[00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:13.800]   You said get away, get away with him, away with him, dismiss him.
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:17.420]   You got rid of him.
[00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:21.380]   And so you see the apostle is looking at the cross and getting them to look at it and says
[00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:22.380]   what do you see?
[00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:27.860]   The hymn, Son of God, Messiah.
[00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:35.140]   Rejected by his own people, handed over to the common hands of these lawless Romans and
[00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:42.020]   nailed and fixed to the tree and he dies, they've got rid of him.
[00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:45.700]   Well there it is, is that all?
[00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:48.900]   Is that the meaning of the death upon the cross?
[00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:53.700]   Is this just a story of the utter spiritual blindness of the Jews?
[00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:56.500]   Is it just a matter of politics on behalf of the Romans?
[00:23:56.500 --> 00:24:00.420]   You see the clever argument that the chief priest used with Pilate?
[00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:04.540]   They said you know if you don't put this man to death you're not Caesar's friend.
[00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:09.340]   If you say this is the king of the Jews, if you say that there is any king except Caesar,
[00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:13.360]   you are being disloyal to your own master and he might have been reported and he might
[00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:15.760]   have lost his post as procurator.
[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:24.060]   So Pilate decides to do it in order, well it's a part of the game of politics.
[00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:28.060]   Is that therefore all that happened on that cross?
[00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:34.580]   Is it just the tragedy of a world that doesn't recognize its own greatest benefactor, the
[00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:40.220]   Jews blind to their Messiah and the Romans utterly ignorant of what was taking place
[00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:43.860]   and just playing that little power politics as usual?
[00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:50.700]   Is it just the tragedy of mankind not recognizing a great religious genius or a great military
[00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:54.820]   or political leader, one who's come to reform the world and to put it in order?
[00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:56.460]   Is it just that?
[00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:58.380]   Is it just the action of men?
[00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:00.180]   Peter says it is the action of men.
[00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:05.620]   "Ye have taken and by wicked hands have crucified and slain."
[00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:09.380]   Men have put him to death though he is the son of God.
[00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:12.460]   Is that all?
[00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:19.940]   Ah, here we come to the very heart of the mystery.
[00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:24.660]   I gave you the second half of Peter's statement before the first half, but this is what Peter
[00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:25.660]   said.
[00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:34.300]   "Him being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have
[00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:40.060]   taken and by the hand of lawless men have crucified and slain."
[00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:42.020]   But what is this?
[00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:43.420]   There's something else here.
[00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:45.340]   And this is where the mystery comes in.
[00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:47.700]   You see the apostles thought it was only men.
[00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:51.580]   The apostles thought it was the Pharisees and scribes and doctors of the law and the
[00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:52.580]   Romans.
[00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:54.100]   They thought it was the action of men.
[00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:55.720]   That's why they were disconsolate.
[00:25:55.720 --> 00:26:01.820]   And if you and I look at this cross and see nothing but men rejecting their Savior, crucifying
[00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:08.460]   a very wonderful person, we haven't started to understand the mystery of the cross.
[00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:12.220]   There is a mystery and a marvel here, and here it is.
[00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:20.540]   "Him being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God."
[00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:24.500]   God's involved here.
[00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:25.860]   It isn't only men.
[00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:26.860]   God.
[00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:28.220]   Let's analyze the terms.
[00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:29.220]   Look at them.
[00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:30.940]   What's the meaning of this word "counsel"?
[00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:32.900]   Well it means "will."
[00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:35.980]   It means "purpose."
[00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:38.780]   What is the meaning of this word "determinate"?
[00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:41.180]   Everybody's agreed it means "determined."
[00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:42.180]   "Predetermined."
[00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:51.980]   "Him being delivered by the predetermined will and purpose and foreknowledge of God."
[00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:52.980]   What is foreknowledge?
[00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:56.420]   Well it doesn't just mean that God knew beforehand that this was going to happen.
[00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:57.420]   No, no.
[00:26:57.420 --> 00:26:58.420]   It's a part of the purpose.
[00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:00.100]   It is a part of the will.
[00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:03.780]   It is a part of the thing that God decided.
[00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:11.180]   "Him being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God."
[00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:12.580]   Who has delivered?
[00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:13.780]   It means "deliver up."
[00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:15.340]   It means "hand over."
[00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:16.900]   Who has handed him over?
[00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:19.460]   Well there's only one answer to this.
[00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:20.460]   It is God.
[00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:22.500]   He's been delivered up.
[00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:30.340]   He's been handed over by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God.
[00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:31.940]   He hasn't been delivered up by men.
[00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:35.020]   He's been delivered up by God to men.
[00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:36.540]   That's the statement.
[00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:40.380]   Now, there can be no difficulty about this, surely.
[00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:46.740]   This is something that can be proved without any difficulty at all.
[00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:53.380]   If God had desired to prevent this death, he could have done it with extreme ease.
[00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:56.460]   The resurrection proves that.
[00:27:56.460 --> 00:28:01.020]   God is not only more powerful than men, he's more powerful than death.
[00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:08.300]   The last enemy, the strongest enemy, he brought him up from the dead.
[00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:14.060]   If God had been desirous of delivering his son from this death at the hands of men, there
[00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:15.900]   would have been no difficulty at all.
[00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:19.060]   Indeed, I've got the word of our Lord himself to prove this.
[00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:23.020]   Don't you remember when his own disciples were ready to defend him and Peter pulled
[00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:24.020]   out his sword?
[00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:25.020]   He said, "Put it back."
[00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:30.500]   He said, "Don't you know that I could commend twelve legions of angels, not only to protect
[00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:37.460]   me but to carry me to heaven without any difficulty whatsoever?"
[00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:39.780]   That settles it, doesn't it?
[00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:45.260]   He was delivered up to this death by God, not by men.
[00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:50.700]   God handed him over to men according to his own predetermined counsel and for knowledge.
[00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:56.540]   He may not have taken him, of course, but it's God who hands him over, the God who could
[00:28:56.540 --> 00:29:00.080]   have taken him to heaven without any difficulty.
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:03.940]   But he doesn't do that, he deliberately hands him over.
[00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:09.440]   Now here, you see, is where the mystery of the cross comes in.
[00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:14.280]   This is the answer to the whole problem, to the enigma.
[00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:16.580]   But let us look at the statement first.
[00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:26.140]   This is what we are told, that God the Almighty Father deliberately handed over his only begotten
[00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:36.740]   Son to the spitting, to the shame, to the condemnation, to the crown of thorns, to the
[00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:43.500]   nails being driven into his holy flesh one by one, to the thirst, to the agony, to the
[00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:45.180]   cry of dereliction.
[00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:58.260]   God his Father handed him over to death, delivered him up to death, sent him of set purpose to
[00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:01.900]   death.
[00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:06.220]   And let me expand it further.
[00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:13.060]   God had decided to send him to death before the very creation of the foundation of the
[00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:21.900]   world, predeterminate will and purpose of God.
[00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:28.500]   A way back in eternity, God had decreed this very thing that's happening.
[00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:29.500]   That's what we are told.
[00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:38.420]   That's the Apostle Peter's explanation of the death upon the cross.
[00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:43.100]   The part of the men was a very subsidiary part.
[00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:47.500]   Thou couldest do nothing at all, as our Lord said to Pilate, except the power had been
[00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:48.860]   given thee from above.
[00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:52.980]   Don't exaggerate yourself and your self-importance, says our Lord to Pilate.
[00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:54.860]   You say that I'm in your hands.
[00:30:54.860 --> 00:31:00.380]   I'm in your hands in one sense only, in another I'm not.
[00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:03.940]   Men did it with their hands, but whose purpose was it?
[00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:06.780]   And the answer is, it was God's.
[00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:12.980]   Men did the thing mechanically, but God handed him over to men.
[00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:18.060]   Him being delivered up by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God.
[00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:20.460]   Here is the question.
[00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:23.140]   Why did God do this?
[00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:26.820]   Why did our Lord set his face steadfastly to go to Jerusalem?
[00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:29.900]   They warned him, they said, that fox Herod is anxious to have you.
[00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:31.500]   They pleaded with him not to go.
[00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:32.500]   He said, I must go.
[00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:34.100]   He set his face steadfastly.
[00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:38.380]   He went deliberately, knowing that he was going to die.
[00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:39.740]   It's all deliberate.
[00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:40.740]   He knew.
[00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:47.420]   The Father sent him.
[00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:48.420]   Why is this?
[00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:50.460]   What is it that's happening here?
[00:31:50.460 --> 00:32:00.140]   Well, there is only one way to understand this great and tremendous mystery.
[00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:04.380]   This happened because, obviously, it had to happen.
[00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:09.580]   God the Father would never have sent his Son to such a death if it could in any way be
[00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:11.060]   avoided.
[00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:13.020]   And the answer is that it couldn't be.
[00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:14.020]   For what?
[00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:16.620]   Well, for this one and only reason.
[00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:26.900]   If a single soul is ever to be forgiven, that must happen.
[00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:27.900]   God is holy.
[00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:28.900]   God is righteous.
[00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:33.140]   God is of such a pure countenance that he cannot even look upon sin.
[00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:36.260]   How can he then forgive?
[00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:41.700]   God has said that the wages of sin is death, that the punishment of sin is death, physical
[00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:46.660]   and spiritual and separation from him, and that he will punish sin.
[00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:51.300]   His justice, his righteousness, his holiness insist upon this.
[00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:52.700]   God is just.
[00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:55.780]   God is light and in him is no darkness at all.
[00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:56.780]   He says that.
[00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:58.300]   He says he must.
[00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:00.220]   Sin must be punished.
[00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:04.420]   How can anybody be forgiven then?
[00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:07.500]   And this is the answer.
[00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:13.060]   Way back before time and before the foundation of the world, the Father and the Son and the
[00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:19.020]   Holy Spirit met in that great council, considering four men, men in sin.
[00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:29.140]   And there the plan was adumbrated and discussed and determined upon the determinate counsel
[00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:30.460]   and foreknowledge of God.
[00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:34.340]   There is only one way, and this is it.
[00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:38.980]   The blessed Son, the second person in the Holy Trinity, should himself go down into
[00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:43.620]   earth and take on him human nature and become a man and become responsible for the sins
[00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:47.780]   of men, be subject to baptism made under the law.
[00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:53.620]   He's going to take it on himself, and he did.
[00:33:53.620 --> 00:34:01.020]   And what is happening there is that God is punishing your sins and mine in the person
[00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:05.660]   and the body of his only begotten Son.
[00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:06.900]   God delivers him up.
[00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:10.140]   Men actually do the crucifying, but it's God who's acting.
[00:34:10.140 --> 00:34:12.660]   Didn't you notice this extraordinary detail?
[00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:16.620]   That in the case of the other two who were crucified, they had to break their bones in
[00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:19.180]   order to kill them and get them out of the way in time.
[00:34:19.180 --> 00:34:22.580]   But when they came to our Lord, they found to their amazement he was already dead.
[00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:24.820]   Indeed, it wasn't men who killed him.
[00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:25.820]   What killed him?
[00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:28.260]   Oh, the separation from God.
[00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:31.300]   My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
[00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:36.180]   That broke his heart literally, and he died.
[00:34:36.180 --> 00:34:40.180]   Men only crucified him.
[00:34:40.180 --> 00:34:45.820]   What killed him, what caused his death, was the bearing of the punishment of your sin
[00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:46.820]   and mine.
[00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:52.620]   God hath made him to be sin who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of
[00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:56.260]   God in him.
[00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:59.260]   You see, the apostles didn't realize this.
[00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:01.020]   They looked on, they saw tragedy.
[00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:03.340]   Our Messiah die, what is this?
[00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:04.340]   Where's his strength?
[00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:05.700]   Where's the power that could raise the dead?
[00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:06.700]   Why doesn't he do something?
[00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:09.020]   They couldn't understand it, they were baffled and bewildered.
[00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:10.460]   They said, why doesn't he save himself?
[00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:11.980]   He could.
[00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:13.460]   Nobody could understand it.
[00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:15.620]   And you see, there is no understanding apart from this.
[00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:16.620]   He didn't want to.
[00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:17.620]   He'd come to die.
[00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:20.540]   He'd left heaven in order to taste death for us.
[00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:23.180]   He had come to make his soul an offering for sin.
[00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:26.900]   God had sent him that he might lay on him the iniquity of us all.
[00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:29.020]   It's God who's doing it.
[00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:33.020]   Him being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God.
[00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:34.020]   Look at him.
[00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:35.820]   Look at the men who are hammering the nails.
[00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:45.020]   And at the back of it all, see the God who in eternity decided to deliver him up.
[00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:54.460]   To smite him that we might be forgiven, that we might be reconciled, that we might become
[00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:56.260]   the sons of God.
[00:35:56.260 --> 00:35:58.180]   Don't misunderstand this, my friends.
[00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:01.140]   This is not in any way lessening the guilt of these men.
[00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:02.580]   Peter brings it home to them.
[00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:05.480]   He says, you men of Israel, you didn't know your own Messiah.
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:06.500]   You crucified him.
[00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:08.420]   You did it through these lawless men.
[00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:10.020]   And God will punish you.
[00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:11.620]   But you see, he did it.
[00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:12.620]   Why?
[00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:15.540]   In order that he might also forgive you.
[00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:18.020]   It's God's action.
[00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:22.460]   And not merely the action of men.
[00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:25.660]   Very well, I must leave you.
[00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:30.300]   I leave you with this mystery, the mystery of mysteries.
[00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:33.460]   The most marvelous and amazing thing that's ever happened.
[00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:34.460]   Look at him.
[00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:37.660]   Do you see the mystery?
[00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:38.660]   Look at him.
[00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:39.660]   What do you see?
[00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:42.300]   A man, weakness.
[00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:46.220]   Yes, but look again.
[00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:52.060]   See God, two natures in one person.
[00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:53.060]   Look at him again.
[00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:55.140]   There he is, dying.
[00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:56.140]   But who is he?
[00:36:56.140 --> 00:37:01.340]   Peter says in the next chapter, he's the prince, the author of life.
[00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:03.900]   He's the one through whom all things are made.
[00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:06.220]   And without him is nothing made that is made.
[00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:09.860]   The mighty creator, dying.
[00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:11.500]   What a mystery.
[00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:15.460]   The author of life, dying.
[00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:16.740]   Look again at that cross.
[00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:17.740]   What do you see?
[00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:19.860]   Oh, this is what I see.
[00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:26.500]   Divine sovereignty, human responsibility, both meeting together.
[00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:29.820]   Him being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God.
[00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:35.420]   He has taken sovereignty of God, base action of men.
[00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:38.380]   But look again.
[00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:39.620]   What do I see there?
[00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:49.020]   Oh, I see the meeting place of divine justice and divine love.
[00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:53.100]   As the old psalmist had put it, mercy and truth have met together.
[00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:55.460]   Righteousness and peace have kissed each other.
[00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:56.900]   They've met together.
[00:37:56.900 --> 00:38:02.740]   The absolute justice of God, yes, and the absolute love of God.
[00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:04.500]   The paradoxes are endless.
[00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:10.420]   The mystery, the marvel, has no end to it.
[00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:13.660]   But you know the greatest mystery of all?
[00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:22.980]   The greatest mystery of all to me is this, that God should have decided and determined
[00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:32.180]   before the very foundation of the world to send his only begotten, dearly beloved son
[00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:43.620]   to that for me, for you.
[00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:54.540]   On that cross of Jesus, mine eye at times can see the very dying form of one who suffered
[00:38:54.540 --> 00:39:05.020]   there for me and from my smitten heart with tears.
[00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:25.260]   Two wonders, I confess, the wonder of his glorious love and my own worthlessness.
[00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:27.940]   Those are the two wonders.
[00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:44.140]   The wonder of his glorious love, the wonder of my own worthlessness, the mystery, the
[00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:51.380]   marvel, the wonder of the cross of Christ.
[00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:53.940]   Have you seen it?
[00:39:53.940 --> 00:40:03.100]   Do you sometimes see by faith upon that cross of Jesus the very dying form of one who suffered
[00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:05.620]   there for me?
[00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:13.540]   Do you go on to say, "And from my smitten heart with tears, two wonders, I confess,
[00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:23.780]   the wonder of his glorious love and my own worthlessness."
[00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:25.540]   Have you seen the wonders?
[00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:28.660]   Have you felt the wonders?
[00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:31.540]   Have you smitten yourself?
[00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:33.220]   Has it ever broken your heart?
[00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:37.780]   It should, my friends, and the Holy Spirit alone can give us such an understanding as
[00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:38.780]   to lead to that.
[00:40:38.780 --> 00:40:40.980]   Have you been broken by this cross?
[00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:45.900]   Have you felt your utter, absolute unworthiness?
[00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:50.460]   Have you seen that all your righteousness is but a filthy rag?
[00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:54.300]   If you have any vestige of self-righteousness left in you, you have never seen the meaning
[00:40:54.300 --> 00:41:02.620]   of this cross, to see the wonder of his glorious love and the love of the Father that decreed
[00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:07.180]   it and sent him to it.
[00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:13.460]   The wonder of his glorious love and my own worthlessness.
[00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:28.900]   Pray God by his Spirit, open our eyes to the wonder, the marvel, the amazement of the cross.
[00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:31.060]   Amen.
[00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:35.020]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
