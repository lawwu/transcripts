[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:36.800]   It's really not every day that you actually get to interact with a patriarch or a godfather
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.000]   of an industry, but today we have that chance.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.280]   And even better, you will like and appreciate the fact that not only is today's guest an
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:55.840]   early retiree, but he's somehow figured out how to actually stay retired and not earn
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.760]   any money or do any work or...
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.560]   Well, okay, he does do work, but at least he doesn't earn money doing it.
[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:21.200]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.920]   My name is Joshua Sheets, and today is Monday, December 8, 2014.
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.280]   I've got a good one for you today.
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.160]   My guest is a man named Doug Nordman.
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:38.000]   If you've ever interacted at all in just about any early retirement forum or online discussion
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.920]   about money, I bet you've seen him.
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.520]   He goes by the handle of Nords.
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.000]   Well, if you didn't see Nords, I'm sure you saw one of his Hawaiian shirts.
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.840]   He's known for having a pair of jeans, a pair of flip-flops, and a Hawaiian shirt on just
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.560]   about any time you meet him, and I think that's awesome.
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.560]   These are some of the perks that you get when you are actually a financially independent
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.680]   early retiree.
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.520]   Also, one of the perks that you get when you leave the military and after however many
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:18.320]   years of keeping your hair short, you get to grow it out into a very nice ponytail.
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.280]   So, my guest today, as I mentioned, is a man named Doug Nordman.
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.120]   Doug is a really awesome guy.
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:29.040]   He and his wife both retired early, and he has gone on, and well, he and his wife, they
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.880]   live in Hawaii, and the cool thing is that they've actually stayed retired.
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.200]   They actually don't do anything for money.
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:41.360]   Although he does blog, he blogs at a website called themilitaryguide.com, the military
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.280]   guide with hyphens in between.
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.360]   So, he blogs there, but he gives away all of the information, excuse me, all of the
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.600]   revenue from the site goes away to military charities.
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:57.360]   He's also written a book for retirement to give advice in the military space, and all
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.560]   of that money, those revenues are given away as well.
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.480]   One of the coolest things about Doug is he's been around in the early retirement space
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.360]   for quite a while, and today, I hope you enjoy this conversation.
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.480]   It's part personal story, personal lessons, but then it's also a good bit about the actual
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.680]   history of the early retirement movement.
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.680]   Enjoy.
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.640]   So, Doug, welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.080]   I appreciate you being with me today.
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.080]   Thanks, Joshua.
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.080]   It's good to be here.
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.920]   So, I think of you, and I'm going to have you tell your story here, kind of introduce
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.040]   yourself, but I think of you as one of the patriarchs of the early retirement space,
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.440]   and so this will be fun.
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.560]   I like patriarch a lot better than geezer, but yeah, that works.
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:50.200]   So, I brought you on today to talk about the history of retirement, and you are a successful
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.200]   early retiree.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.480]   To the best of my knowledge, you retired early, and you've been able to stay sort of semi-retired
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.480]   early.
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.200]   So, I'd love for you to share your personal story, and then also, primarily what we're
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.880]   going to focus on today is talking about the history of early retirement and its evolution
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.240]   over time, but what's your story as it surrounds money and early retirement?
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.480]   Well, I joined the Navy right out of high school and started my career in the early
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:21.160]   1980s in the submarine force and retired from that after I got my 20 years in 2002, and
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.200]   as I was coming up on retirement in the '90s, I started trying to figure out what I wanted
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.240]   to do with myself after I left the military, and I wasn't really happy with what looked
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:37.240]   like the options and opportunities, and when my wife and I were both in the military back
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.480]   in the '80s and '90s, we were both on active duty, and then later on, she moved from active
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:47.680]   duty into the reserves, and so she and I have been a dual-income couple for our working
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:48.680]   years.
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:54.680]   She retired from the reserves in 2008, and as we were saving our money, we were very
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.680]   busy, as you might imagine, in the service, and it was easy to be frugal when you're
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:06.120]   on sea duty or deployed or either just underway all the time working hard, and so we'd always
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.840]   try to save at least one income whenever we could, and over the years, we noticed that
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.440]   was compounding very nicely to the point where it was almost like having a third income in
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:21.520]   the house, and as we got through the '80s and into the '90s, it became more easy to
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.720]   calculate how much you'd need for retirement.
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.040]   Back in the '80s, if you wanted to figure out when you could retire, you had to send
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:36.200]   away for a notebook or a workbook or maybe you could get a floppy disk from a finance
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:40.020]   company, and most of them would assume that you were going to retire at age 65.
[00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:44.980]   If you wanted to retire earlier than 65, you had to figure out what math they were using
[00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:48.800]   in their tables, and you had to do your own formulas, and you had to extrapolate your
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:54.560]   own stuff, and so that wasn't even on the radar of most financial companies or most
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.560]   planners or even most investors back in the '80s, and then in the '90s, people started
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:00.560]   getting a little more flexible.
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.720]   They were starting to see people retire earlier and realized that maybe age 65 is not the
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.920]   traditional retirement date.
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.960]   In retrospect, years after it was published, I discovered a book that had been written
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.880]   in 1984.
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.200]   It was written by Paul and Vicki Terhorst.
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.360]   I don't know if anybody knows this one anymore.
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.560]   It's been out of print for years, but it's called "Cashing in on the American Dream,
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.560]   How to Retire when You're Age 35."
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.520]   I remember finding that book when I was 41 years old, and I was thinking, "Crap, I missed
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:31.520]   the deadline.
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.200]   I was too late."
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:39.140]   He was an accountant at a consulting firm, and he managed to save enough money to actually
[00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:41.100]   retire in 1984.
[00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:44.760]   That was one of the very first people that I was aware of who early retired.
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:48.440]   He and his wife, Vicki, became expatriates.
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:54.120]   They became world travelers, and they spent the last 30 years going from one country overseas
[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.120]   to another.
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.520]   I mean, from South America to Europe to Asia, they've been everywhere.
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:04.000]   What really made an impact on me and my wife was in the early '90s with the publication
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   of a book by Joe Dominguez and Vicki Robin called "Your Money or Your Life."
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   Have you heard of that one?
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   I have.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.280]   In fact, I've actually read "Cashing in on the American Dream" years ago, but "Your
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:18.320]   Money or Your Life" was one of my favorites from an early age that completely shifted
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.440]   how I thought about money.
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:24.680]   It was still on my top 10 recommendations list.
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.080]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:27.240]   The movement lives on today.
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:31.880]   I mean, Vicki's kept the website going for years and does seminars and still talks about
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:33.680]   it with everybody she can get a hold of.
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.520]   It made a big difference in 1992.
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:40.600]   I think that was one of the first times that anybody had seen a widely publicized way to
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:44.920]   save your income and get to the point where you had more passive income.
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:49.320]   At that crossover point, that chart in the book is very important for a lot of people
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:50.320]   these days.
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.240]   So, we used that.
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:55.420]   As the '90s went on, we began to realize that we were getting closer and closer to that
[00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:56.420]   financial independence.
[00:07:56.420 --> 00:08:02.280]   I'd say by late '99, early 2000, it looked like we were probably going to make it.
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:06.320]   We had been saving 50% of our income for 20 years.
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:12.120]   If the math is done and you look at the safe withdrawal rate and 25 times your annual spending,
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.360]   it looked like we were going to make it.
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:19.520]   I retired in the summer of 2002, so it's been just over 12 years.
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:24.440]   We've taken our retirement finances through two recessions and everything's worked out
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:25.440]   fine.
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:29.600]   I mean, the recession itself is not fun, but it's nice to see that your retirement savings
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:33.000]   will carry you through, that your investments are working out the way they should.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.560]   By now, we're comfortable with volatility and we understand how things are going to
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:41.200]   work and we all feel like we know what our spending is going to be.
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:44.000]   From here on out, we're just enjoying ourselves.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.480]   You used the word semi-retired, but it's all for fun now.
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:52.680]   I haven't had a W-2 or any income for 12 years.
[00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:57.720]   I give away all the income from the book and the blog that I get to military-friendly charities
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:03.080]   and that helps people want to contribute more advice and stories for future editions of
[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:05.200]   the book and for other books that I'm going to write someday.
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:11.600]   It's what I always admired most about Joe Dominguez, author of Your Money or Your Life.
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:15.280]   If everything I've read about him was correct, it seemed that when he retired, he actually
[00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:19.280]   retired and didn't go on to try to make a bunch of money telling other people how to
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:20.400]   get rich and retire.
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:27.240]   It seemed that he really did walk his walk and just simply lived on his portfolio and
[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:30.880]   either gave away or he gave away, I think, income from his book and some of those other
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:31.880]   things, right?
[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:32.880]   Is that correct?
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:33.880]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:39.960]   By the time he died of cancer in the late '90s and by the time that was occurring, he
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:45.520]   had still continued to put all of his investments in treasury bonds and he was living off of
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:49.480]   treasuries and inflation was just eating away at him.
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:53.320]   By the time he died, he was living in a group home and I think he was managing to live on
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:57.200]   a very small amount of money, something like $8,000 or $9,000 a year.
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:02.360]   So he stuck with his portfolio through the rest of his life even though Paul Terhorst,
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:07.480]   the writer of Cashing in an American Dream, he started out all on certificates of deposit,
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:12.560]   all on CDs in 1984, which you could do with interest rates back in 1984.
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:18.520]   But even Paul by now has moved to a mix of index funds from the S&P 500.
[00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:23.840]   But Joe did not do that and he never attempted, as near as I can tell, to profit off of Your
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:24.840]   Money or Your Life.
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:30.120]   I'm sure people took care of him, but he didn't attempt to go on a world tour and make himself
[00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:31.120]   filthy rich.
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:32.840]   Was he burned by Wall Street?
[00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:36.320]   It just seems so strange that that's always what you have to, whenever I give the book
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:40.080]   away, and even in the updated version they mention this, but I always have to say, "Listen,
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:43.520]   you can't necessarily do this on treasuries anymore."
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:47.320]   Was he just burned by investing or do you have any idea why he was so committed to that
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.760]   investing course of action?
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:56.280]   He made his first million by the time he was 29 years old, I believe, in the late 60s.
[00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:59.920]   And I think he just felt that he'd seen enough and he wanted to do his own thing.
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:05.120]   I don't know that there was any particular trigger or trauma or event, except the realization,
[00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:11.040]   of course, that every day that he was working, he was losing that much of his life and he
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:14.240]   wanted to save and be able to do his own living.
[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:15.240]   Interesting.
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:20.920]   So when you were setting out, did any of these, and it's been at least a decade since I read
[00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:23.440]   Cashing in an American Dream, so I don't remember anything that's in it.
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:27.920]   I've tried to track down, for the show, I've tried to track down Paul.
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.240]   I haven't been able to find him yet.
[00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:34.880]   If any listener knows how to get a hold of him, I'd love to interview him and some of
[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:36.920]   the other people as well.
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:39.800]   But did they talk about actually any metrics?
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:44.000]   For example, today we commonly talk about 25 times annual income, but did they talk
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.840]   about any metrics or was it more of the idea at that stage?
[00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:49.320]   Well, no, for them it was the idea.
[00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:51.120]   And of course, he's an accountant.
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:55.840]   He was able to take his CPA skills and figure out how to project his cash flow and the assets
[00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.040]   he'd need for that.
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:02.600]   And what he did was look at his spending that they could achieve overseas in various inexpensive
[00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:07.000]   third world countries and figure that out with the CDs.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.360]   So when they retired, 100% in CDs and they knew the income from the CDs was going to
[00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:12.320]   pay their costs of living overseas.
[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:13.320]   Got it.
[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:14.320]   Yeah.
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:19.920]   Going from 17% CD rates for a six month CD back in, I don't know what year that was,
[00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:20.920]   to today.
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:26.120]   I would imagine your income plan would collapse if it were still based on CDs.
[00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:27.120]   Don't try this at home, folks.
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:30.640]   These are trained professionals and we didn't know much back then.
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:33.880]   How old were you and your wife in 2002 when you retired?
[00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:39.880]   I retired at age 41 and she was slightly behind me in age and our daughter was almost 10 years
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:40.880]   old.
[00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:44.880]   I don't know if you've raised kids, but at that age it's what I refer to as the danger
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:45.880]   zone.
[00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:47.880]   So I was glad to be able to spend more time at home with her.
[00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:48.880]   Sure.
[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:51.760]   Yeah, my wife and I have a one year old son at the moment.
[00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:52.760]   So we're not there yet.
[00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:55.640]   All I got to say is it gets better.
[00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:56.640]   Awesome.
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:57.960]   We're enjoying it now.
[00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:00.600]   So if it gets better, we're excited about that.
[00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:04.960]   How big of a role in your financial planning did the military background make?
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:09.720]   And I assume you did your 20 years in order to get the full payout amount.
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:13.920]   What big a role was the military pension system in your retirement?
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:17.560]   It started out as barely covering a portion of the bills.
[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:23.400]   When you retire from the US military, you at 20 years get a pension that's based on
[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:26.600]   approximately 50% of your base pay.
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:30.820]   And when I say approximately, we use an average of the final three years of the highest pay
[00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:35.960]   you've had during that 20 years and you get 50% of your base pay.
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:40.720]   What that works out to in real terms is that you have your regular military paycheck and
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:46.160]   your housing allowance and your food allowance and maybe some CPA or some bonus pay for other
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:47.640]   specialties that you have.
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:51.920]   And then you go and you retire, your income drops to about one third of what it was during
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:52.920]   your working years.
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:57.200]   Because again, that pension is based on your base pay and you don't get any extras for
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:00.400]   any of the allowances you've been earning over the years.
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:02.680]   So most people are caught unawares.
[00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:05.640]   They think, "Oh, well, I'm making $80,000 a year when I retire.
[00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:08.600]   I'll get a pension of $40,000 and life will be good."
[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:09.760]   Not so fast.
[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:14.640]   If your income is $80,000 when you're on active duty, all of your income, your allowances
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:19.680]   that are not taxed as well as your taxable income, when you retire, you'll be looking
[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:26.040]   at a pension more around $23,000, $24,000 because of that issue with base pay.
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:31.880]   And back then we had retired with a mortgage on our home and we had expected that we would
[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:33.720]   be able to fit that into our finances.
[00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:40.200]   What we anticipated was that I'd use the military pension to buy the groceries and pay the mortgage
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:42.840]   and the rest of it we'd handle from our investments.
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:48.060]   You know, the 4% safe withdrawal rate, we had enough investments to make that work.
[00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:53.560]   And then, I did not anticipate this at all, but then interest rates started dropping in
[00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:58.480]   the 2000s after the recession and we started refinancing.
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:03.740]   And so, over the years, the military pension rises with a cost of living adjustment just
[00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:04.740]   like Social Security.
[00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:05.740]   It's the same COLA.
[00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:12.680]   Over the years, 12 years of military retirement, my pension has risen by 27%.
[00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:16.560]   But more importantly, we've refinanced this property enough that our mortgage payment
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:18.120]   has dropped by 40%.
[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:26.420]   And so, today, my pension, $42,000 a year, covers almost all of our spending.
[00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:31.680]   We could live on that $42,000 a year if we cut back and had to do that with non-discretionary
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:32.680]   expenses.
[00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:36.400]   But of course, we spend a little more money for entertainment and travel.
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:40.160]   But it's been very reassuring to know that the military pension and the inflation adjustment
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:43.040]   have covered us over the years and taken care of us.
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:47.240]   One other big advantage for the military retiree is cheap healthcare.
[00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:52.800]   I don't know if you track the numbers, but military retirees can get health insurance
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.840]   through TRICARE.
[00:15:54.840 --> 00:16:03.600]   The full coverage program, TRICARE Prime, has a monthly premium of about $55 tops.
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:07.440]   It rises a little bit every year with inflation, but again, it's one of the cheapest health
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:10.800]   programs around and it's enabled us to retire as well.
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:14.480]   If you looked at other insurance policies that you could get through the healthcare
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:19.180]   exchanges through the ACA, it costs, what, eight, ten times more than that for people
[00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:21.120]   even without pre-existing conditions.
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:26.680]   So those two factors, cheap healthcare and the cost of living adjustment on the military
[00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:28.680]   pension have been a big factor.
[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:29.680]   Yeah.
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:33.160]   I've never actually worked with anybody who was on TRICARE.
[00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:39.040]   I briefly studied it in a textbook for one of my registered health underwriter classes.
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:41.200]   We had to do a bunch of stuff on TRICARE.
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:45.040]   It always struck me as something that I wanted to research more.
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:49.120]   In order to be eligible for TRICARE, do you need to do, what are the benefits, in order
[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:54.080]   to be eligible for TRICARE after termination of service, what are the requirements for
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:55.080]   that?
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.080]   Do you know?
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:17:00.280]   You get TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Standard when you retire from active duty.
[00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:04.380]   When you retire from the reserves, and the reserves are a little different from active
[00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:08.740]   duty, the reserves in National Guard, you retire and you're awaiting your pension to
[00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:11.040]   start at age 60.
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:15.280]   When you retire from the reserves of the Guard, you can also get a form of TRICARE insurance.
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:17.740]   It's called TRICARE Retired Reserve.
[00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:21.560]   That is not subsidized by the federal government, so you end up paying a fairly high premium.
[00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:27.880]   It might be as much as $600 or $900 a month, depending on individuals or families.
[00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:33.160]   That is a good insurance program to have to bridge the time from when you stop drilling
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:38.160]   with the reserves or National Guard until you start your pension at age 60.
[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:42.720]   Everything else requires you to be on active duty or be in drilling status with the reserve
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:43.720]   or National Guard.
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:49.060]   The TRICARE programs assume that you're in uniform.
[00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:53.900]   When you get to Medicare age, you might have heard of TRICARE for Life, which is a supplemental
[00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:55.260]   Medicare insurance.
[00:17:55.260 --> 00:18:01.060]   That pays a second payer to Medicare for military retirees that are age 65 or over, as soon
[00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:04.020]   as you start Medicare.
[00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:10.780]   How big of a difference does military or can, because I know now you write specifically
[00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:13.240]   towards the military audience.
[00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:17.740]   How big of a difference do the other ancillary benefits in addition to salary and in addition
[00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:19.060]   to healthcare expenses?
[00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:26.580]   For example, housing provided, I'm not fully, my dad was in the Navy in the subs, but I've
[00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:27.580]   never been in.
[00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:31.020]   I know that a lot of other stuff is covered.
[00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:34.620]   How big of a difference does that make from the perspective of an early retirement?
[00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:38.540]   Twenty, 25 years ago, it used to make a substantial difference.
[00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:41.920]   Big box stores have cut that down quite a bit these days.
[00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:45.820]   For example, you used to try to retire near a military base so that you had access to
[00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:51.900]   a commissary for food and used to try to go on a base to buy cheap gasoline or to be able
[00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:53.340]   to use the exchange.
[00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:58.940]   Costco, Walmart, Sam's Club, all of those big box stores have followed up on that model.
[00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:01.580]   Today, the prices are pretty close.
[00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:05.780]   You generally know what's cheaper at Costco and you know what's more expensive at Walmart
[00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:09.140]   and you know where to buy gas on base at a good price.
[00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:17.240]   I would say that the base access is not as significant as the cola and the healthcare.
[00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:21.200]   Some people though, you take great comfort in being able to go on the base where you
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:25.420]   know the culture and you know the places that are familiar to you.
[00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:28.860]   You can go work on your car at the auto hobby shop.
[00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:34.140]   You can go pull your car in and rent a lift for the ridiculous sum of like $5 or $10 an
[00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:35.140]   hour.
[00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:39.540]   You can go join the gym and have a workout program there or a runner's club.
[00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:42.660]   Again, it's a very nominal fee for retirees.
[00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:44.820]   People enjoy doing that.
[00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:49.900]   We're much less tied to military bases in retirement than we used to be 25 or 30 years
[00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:50.900]   ago.
[00:19:50.900 --> 00:20:01.300]   I'm going to read a paragraph here, but the question is, "Do you think that joining the
[00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:10.020]   military would be a primary strategy for someone who's primarily interested in saying, 'How
[00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:12.700]   quickly can I retire?'"
[00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:16.500]   And before you answer that, I want to read a paragraph as an introduction here.
[00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:20.620]   This is from a Yahoo Finance article, which you are very familiar with both this article
[00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:22.100]   and the follow-up.
[00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:31.020]   But the paragraph here is about a young man named Anton Ivanov.
[00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:34.980]   And the story was that at 27 years old, he had become a millionaire.
[00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:39.380]   And one of the primary ways that he did this was by joining the military, which allowed
[00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:41.500]   him to save 60% of his income.
[00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:45.820]   And this paragraph in the story here says, "Fortunately, military life was the perfect
[00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:49.080]   environment for a single person looking to save.
[00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:54.180]   The bulk of his fixed expenses, housing, food, transportation, insurance, were covered.
[00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:58.340]   He set up automatic transfers for his savings and investment accounts and followed a strict
[00:20:58.340 --> 00:20:59.340]   schedule.
[00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:02.100]   First, he maxed out his annual Roth IRA contribution.
[00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:06.100]   Then he contributed the maximum to his annual thrift savings plan, the federal employee
[00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:07.940]   version of the 401(k).
[00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:11.460]   Then he split the remaining balance between his brokerage account and the savings funds
[00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:14.180]   he keeps for future real estate investments.
[00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:17.780]   While he studied here and extra cash through one-off web design and programming gigs, he
[00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:22.500]   got through freelance job sites like elance.com and odesk.com.
[00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:27.420]   He estimates these side jobs added another $15,000 to $20,000 to his annual income."
[00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:33.220]   So if that paragraph were true, then this sounds like basically the ultimate retirement
[00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:34.220]   plan.
[00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:37.140]   Join the military, all of your expenses are covered, save 50% of your income, use all
[00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:40.940]   your extra time to earn extra money, and invest it wisely.
[00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:42.980]   Comment away.
[00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:45.220]   It actually works.
[00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:47.500]   It's the real proof, the real system.
[00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:53.740]   And it's a shame that he went and lied about his actual sources of his assets and destroyed
[00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:54.740]   his credibility.
[00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:57.300]   I take that very personally because he's a military veteran.
[00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:00.260]   You should know better than to lie like that.
[00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:04.500]   But the reality is that all those methods he describes work just fine in the military.
[00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:08.620]   I'd even go a step further and say that in the military, when you're in uniform, you
[00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:13.020]   are extremely familiar with deprivation.
[00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:15.660]   You're used to living outdoors for weeks at a time.
[00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:20.940]   You're used to living in a very small space with a very small bed and very limited storage.
[00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:24.480]   You're used to working long hours and strange hours.
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:28.620]   You're used to only being fed once or twice a day if you're out in the field.
[00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:33.780]   There's a whole bunch of different things in the military that we put up with that even
[00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:37.420]   convicts in the federal prison system have lawyers who have given them more privileges
[00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:41.780]   and more rights than some people in the military.
[00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:43.900]   And yet, it works.
[00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:50.340]   And by that line between frugality and deprivation, you can easily save 40 to 50% of your pay
[00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:54.440]   while you're in active duty, even if you're single, even if you're married.
[00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:58.900]   Either way, you can still try to save 40 to 50% of your money while you're in uniform.
[00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:04.300]   And the way that he lays out the savings program is exactly where you're supposed to do it.
[00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:07.860]   Max out your Roth IRA, max out your thrift savings plan, put the additional money in
[00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:11.260]   taxable accounts, and plan for your transition.
[00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:12.260]   It works.
[00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:15.220]   The math is there and the money from the military is there.
[00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:20.020]   Admittedly, when you join the Navy or any of the services at the age of 17 or 18 years
[00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:22.060]   old, you're going to have a very small paycheck.
[00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:26.580]   And you might be challenged even at maxing out the contribution to your Roth IRA.
[00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:30.180]   But the longer you stay in the military, the more your pay rises, the more you get promoted,
[00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:34.780]   and the easier it is to max out your Roth IRA, your spouse's Roth IRA, your thrift savings
[00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:37.740]   plan, and that accelerates and compounds.
[00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:39.820]   So everything he said, it works.
[00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:42.020]   It's just a shame that he had to lie about his assets.
[00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:48.340]   Yeah, and the backstory on this is as we record this on November 25th, a couple days ago it
[00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:49.340]   came out.
[00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:51.580]   The backstory was published that I just referenced.
[00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:55.940]   But then some days later it came out that the man had evidently lied about the entire
[00:23:55.940 --> 00:24:01.580]   thing and the bulk of his million dollar net worth, I guess he actually was a millionaire,
[00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:11.980]   but the bulk of that million dollar net worth was accumulated through his, like an inheritance
[00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:13.740]   that he had received of some kind.
[00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:16.340]   And that was the primary source of wealth.
[00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:23.780]   And so the problem was that it may have violated the actual facts, and that is a legitimate
[00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:29.220]   issue, violated the actual facts, but that doesn't take it away as a useful example.
[00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:30.220]   Exactly.
[00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:34.540]   And again, he destroyed his credibility there, but the math still works.
[00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:38.740]   And I'd encourage all service members today to keep maxing out their contributions to
[00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:43.300]   their IRAs, to their thrift savings plan, and save as much as you can for as long as
[00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:44.300]   you can.
[00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:48.460]   The reason is because in the military you're extremely experienced with being frugal, and
[00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:53.500]   you know when you've gone too far because you've experienced deprivation too.
[00:24:53.500 --> 00:25:01.820]   How much does, at 18 years old, someone joining up, 18, just a rank and file person, how much
[00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:04.660]   does an 18 year old recruit make, would you guess?
[00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:05.660]   It's pretty pitiful.
[00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:09.340]   It's about 17, $18,000 a year in paycheck.
[00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:12.580]   But again, housing is subsidized or free.
[00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:14.620]   Food is subsidized or free as well.
[00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:17.940]   It depends on where you're stationed and whether you're married or not.
[00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:22.820]   And the total compensation package when you just join the military is probably about $30,000
[00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:24.980]   to $35,000 a year.
[00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:27.620]   Again that's highly dependent on what part of the country you're living in and whether
[00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:32.180]   you're stationed overseas, because the living allowances that you get for food and housing
[00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:36.060]   will vary with the location you're stationed in.
[00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:39.740]   And I would add to that, that after you've been in the military for a couple years, you're
[00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:44.700]   probably getting at least one promotion if you sign on for a very technical field or
[00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:48.620]   if you sign on for a little longer commitment, like six or eight years, then you get a couple
[00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:49.980]   more promotions.
[00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:54.940]   So that starting salary is like going into a McDonald's and working a minimum wage job.
[00:25:54.940 --> 00:26:00.660]   However, if you were doing the equivalent of working at McDonald's, then by the way
[00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:03.860]   the military works it, within six years you'd be running that McDonald's.
[00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:08.460]   And that's what happens in the military is that with a six or eight year enlistment,
[00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:13.260]   you'll be at least up the ranks to E5 or E6 and you'll be looking at annual compensation
[00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:18.980]   of, again this depends on skills and where you're stationed, of between $50,000 and $75,000
[00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:19.980]   a year.
[00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:26.020]   I have a friend who owns a bunch of McDonald's and if you apply yourself in six years you
[00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:28.820]   can be running any McDonald's in the world.
[00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:33.860]   It's not, that's right, it's not about the skills, it's just about the work and the persistence.
[00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:36.780]   You know, I don't know if your father was a nuclear trained submariner or not.
[00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:38.820]   He was on the last of the diesel boats.
[00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:39.820]   Oh, okay.
[00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:42.820]   Diesel boats forever, guy.
[00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:48.500]   The nuclear trained officers today in the submarine force are able to, at their sixth
[00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:53.780]   or seventh year of service, make over $100,000 a year on a bonus contract.
[00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:59.140]   It's as high as $130,000 a year total package just for all the nuclear training and for
[00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:03.460]   being willing to stick around past that initial obligation for a few more years.
[00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:04.460]   Right.
[00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:08.220]   I'll tell you an interesting story, I'll make it very brief, but Admiral Rickover actually,
[00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:14.340]   he rejected my dad and when he applied to the program because his grades weren't good
[00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:19.900]   enough and he was very hard working but he was working full time and going to school
[00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:23.820]   full time and he'd gotten his engineering degree and he was rejected.
[00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:29.620]   So he stayed on the diesel subs but looking back on it later, he was on the last of the
[00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:30.620]   diesel subs.
[00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:35.020]   And they sold it to, it's parked in Arkansas, Razorback I think is what-
[00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:36.020]   Oh, okay.
[00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:37.020]   Of course it's Razorback.
[00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:38.020]   Yeah.
[00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:41.020]   That was the boat that he was on.
[00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:44.460]   But he looks back on it and he says one of the greatest blessings that he ever had was
[00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:49.660]   that he didn't wind up in the nuclear program just because at that time, the lifestyle,
[00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:54.620]   I mean it was so difficult as it was to be on the diesel boats and out on six month cruises
[00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:58.860]   and just the sheer difference of intensity that it would have required from the nuclear
[00:27:58.860 --> 00:27:59.860]   program.
[00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:05.460]   And he was glad later with hindsight that he was, that passed over for that.
[00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:10.740]   I got a chance to speak with the Admiral myself three days before he retired and he was a
[00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:13.780]   little grumpy about it but that's how I got in the program.
[00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:18.820]   After he had what, he was the one who completely changed the rules for how many years, right?
[00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:19.820]   Exactly.
[00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:23.740]   So that he could keep running the Navy long past anyone that was supposed to be around.
[00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:26.420]   Well, they actually passed some new laws.
[00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:30.220]   Congress passed new laws after he retired because by that point, he'd outlived all his
[00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:33.820]   supporters in Congress.
[00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:36.940]   It did make us very intense and focused over the years.
[00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:41.940]   In the last 12 years, I spent a lot of time trying to slow down and not be so intense
[00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:46.420]   and focused about certain things just because of my submarine nuclear training background.
[00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:47.700]   I believe it.
[00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:50.520]   So let's continue on the early retirement theme.
[00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:57.820]   So your early influences were Paul Terhorst's book, Cashing in the American Dream and then
[00:28:57.820 --> 00:28:58.820]   Your Money or Your Life.
[00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:00.560]   But you've watched this develop.
[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:04.940]   So today, I've come in on the tail end of this stuff.
[00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:09.720]   Basically now where it's this massive, I think it's a massive movement all across the world.
[00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:16.120]   What were some of the other developments and especially how did the online community develop?
[00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:21.520]   I was dialing into bulletin board systems with a modem back in the late 90s.
[00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:26.480]   Back then, one of the more popular places to have an internet discussion was The Motley
[00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:27.480]   Fool.
[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:31.480]   This was back when The Motley Fool was a brand new startup and very popular among people
[00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:34.640]   because all their forums were free.
[00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:40.000]   They had a very robust retire early homepage there that had a lot of people posting on
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.400]   it and a lot of discussions back and forth.
[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:45.000]   Then The Motley Fool tried to charge a monthly fee.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.360]   It was some ridiculous sum like $5 a month to be a member of The Motley Fool forums and
[00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:52.720]   that led to a mass exodus.
[00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:57.960]   That business plan did not work out well for the fools but the residents there on the retire
[00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:03.380]   early page left and went to a new forum that was started by a guy who's still in the business
[00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:04.380]   today.
[00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:06.360]   He started his forum in 1996.
[00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:08.280]   It's the retire early homepage.
[00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:10.880]   His name is John Greeney.
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:17.240]   He retired from the oil and gas industry in the Houston area back in the late 90s.
[00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:22.880]   Even today, it's been 18 years, he still posts to his forum I'd say four or five times a
[00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:25.340]   year.
[00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:28.880]   They all moved over there and they started doing the same research and discussion that
[00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:32.320]   they'd been doing on The Motley Fool.
[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:36.080]   Another forum got started in 2002.
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:40.020]   This is one that I've been associated with for over 12 years now.
[00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:47.920]   It's called the earlyretirement.org website, early-retirement.org.
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:55.840]   That got started in 2002 by a web designer, a guy who had retired from an IT job.
[00:30:55.840 --> 00:31:01.980]   He said that when he was working in the late 90s that one of his office mates had a retirement
[00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:06.200]   ceremony and they made a big joke out of putting all kinds of retirement stuff on a door to
[00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:07.920]   his office.
[00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:12.240]   One of them was a printout from that John Greeney retire early homepage that had all
[00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:13.760]   the information about early retirement.
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:19.640]   That was the first time that this guy at earlyretirement.org had thought about early retirement.
[00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:24.680]   What he managed to do was not only to retire early, but he and his spouse bought a small
[00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:27.160]   boat, a trawler, a 36-foot trawler.
[00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:32.760]   They actually spent their time cruising up and down on the intercoastal waterway.
[00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:37.720]   He was running the forum from his cell phones in the afternoons after they would tie up
[00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:45.160]   somewhere he'd get online with his cell phone at some pitiful data rate and manage the forum.
[00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:48.560]   That went on from 2002 to about 2005.
[00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:53.440]   The forum kept growing the whole time as more of us got in there and got interested in figuring
[00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:56.520]   out the math and the lifestyle behind early retirement.
[00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:58.720]   That was Dory36.
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:01.720]   He named his online presence for the boat.
[00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:05.040]   He was on a 36-foot trawler.
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:08.800]   I had worked on that forum when I retired in 2002.
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:14.200]   About 2004, I started asking questions about the lifestyle and the finances.
[00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:18.200]   I'd been, of course, early retired for 18 months by then, but I was just checking in
[00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:20.520]   with the experts here to make sure I didn't miss something.
[00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:24.440]   I wanted to make sure I understood all the factors and had accounted for them all.
[00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:30.240]   I wanted to know if the, I wouldn't call it a failure rate, I'd call it a recidivism rate
[00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:33.200]   was higher than 50%.
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:35.920]   I wanted to know if people were just sitting around for a couple of years and then going
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:36.920]   back to work.
[00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:39.400]   I was, "Oh, no, no.
[00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:42.440]   If you're having fun and you're early retired and you're enjoying life, it's probably going
[00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:45.520]   to continue like that for the rest of your life."
[00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:46.520]   That was very reassuring.
[00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:47.760]   I hung around on that board.
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:54.720]   I've been posting there since early 2004, over 10 years, almost 11 years now.
[00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:57.040]   There have been a few other sites over the years.
[00:32:57.040 --> 00:33:05.200]   One other site that started up in 2004 was started by a retired radiologist.
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:11.640]   His poster name is Raddr, R-A-D-D-R, Radiation Doctor.
[00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:13.840]   He did a lot of math and number crunching back then.
[00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:18.560]   He figured out a lot of the math behind the 4% safe withdrawal rate.
[00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:21.120]   He looked at long-term retirements.
[00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:26.720]   The original 4% safe withdrawal rate was for a 30-year survival on a portfolio.
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:30.760]   He did research, some of the first research I'd seen, to extend that out to 50 years.
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:34.600]   Of course, he came up with a slightly smaller number, but it was encouraging to see that
[00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:36.360]   it could work.
[00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:42.360]   His board is also still active these years, after all these years.
[00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:46.360]   He did a lot of the website research and then left that as a webpage and then went on and
[00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:47.360]   started a forum.
[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:52.840]   I'd say the next big initiative was Morningstar.
[00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:58.200]   The Monopoly Fool was one of the first places to have a robust bunch of forums about investing
[00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:03.520]   in retirement, but Morningstar also had a bunch of forums of their own.
[00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:10.440]   There was an incident, I'd say around 2006, 2007, I'm not exactly sure when, a lot of
[00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:14.280]   the boards were not very well moderated by Morningstar.
[00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:17.960]   One of the forums that they had there was the Vanguard Diehards.
[00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:22.360]   They had a notorious troll on there.
[00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:26.560]   That troll just completely ruined the environment for everybody.
[00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:30.080]   It actually inspired a number of the Vanguard Diehards to break off and start their own
[00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:32.080]   forum and that became Bogleheads.
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:33.080]   Interesting.
[00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:35.000]   Yeah, that was the start of Bogleheads.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:40.640]   It was the problems that Morningstar had taking care of moderating their own forum.
[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:43.480]   I think it's been one of the greatest things to happen for early retirement.
[00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:48.280]   The Bogleheads have done a lot of work to make sure everybody understands not just early
[00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:53.880]   retirement but investing and conventional retirement, whatever retirement you want.
[00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:56.000]   One of their biggest contributions has been their wiki.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:02.080]   They've put together a very robust archive of information articles on retirement, investing,
[00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:03.680]   and lifestyle.
[00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:07.580]   We've contributed to a substantial archive over there for the military as well as for
[00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:12.400]   other types of occupations and other people that are interested in either a traditional
[00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:16.680]   career and retiring in their 60s or early retirement or maybe they're just interested
[00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:20.040]   in working for the rest of their lives or living overseas, however they want to do it.
[00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:23.720]   Let me ask you a question and interrupt your time flow here with a question about forums
[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:28.760]   because I personally have really enjoyed a lot of forums and have learned from them.
[00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:33.280]   I've recommended to many people, including clients, that the best place to go is to find
[00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:34.840]   a good forum and ask people.
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:38.120]   But I have two concerns about that.
[00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:42.680]   The first one is a small concern that usually forums are organized around one specific theme
[00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:44.500]   so you've got to find the right forum.
[00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:50.040]   For example, if you are in the Bogleheads forum, you're going to get acolytes of John
[00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:54.480]   Bogle, which is nothing wrong with that, but there are other points of view and that would
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:58.680]   be different than I've never been in the forum, but I'm sure there's a Berkshire Hathaway
[00:35:58.680 --> 00:35:59.680]   stock owners forum somewhere.
[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:01.800]   I've never been there, but I'm sure it exists.
[00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:04.080]   So that would be a different perspective.
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:07.800]   But my bigger concern is how to figure out who knows what they're talking about in the
[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:14.080]   forums because I've privately connected and I've privately contributed and anonymously
[00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:17.520]   contributed in a few forums, which I think is one of the big major values.
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:19.920]   But there are a few forums where I've publicized who I am.
[00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:23.240]   Probably the one I've participated in the most is the Money Mustache forum, which is
[00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:28.120]   a great forum, but sometimes I go in there and I see somebody giving bad advice.
[00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:33.800]   The other day I posted somebody had a question on life insurance and I only had time, but
[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:35.640]   I said, "Let me give it..."
[00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:41.960]   The question was I'm 23 years old and I went in and they said, "What kind of life insurance
[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:42.960]   should I buy?"
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:46.720]   And I said, "Well, that's a great consideration and it's a topic I know my stuff in."
[00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:53.000]   And they were trying to figure out the difference between the AICPA offerings versus others.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.240]   And all I simply said was I said, "Don't buy level term life insurance.
[00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:59.720]   Buy annual renewable term life insurance at your age."
[00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:07.120]   And that's a very unusual but very, very strong and I feel very strongly about that perspective.
[00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:11.740]   But I'm very qualified to go in and defend that, but I'm not willing to dedicate the
[00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:18.360]   time to going into the forum and saying, "Here's why you need to listen to me."
[00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:21.760]   And I don't want to go in and get in an argument with people, but the problem is that many
[00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:26.160]   people are very well intentioned, but they might not have necessarily the level of technical
[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:27.640]   background to understand what they're doing.
[00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:30.960]   How do you figure out who's blowing smoke and who knows what they're talking about in
[00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:31.960]   a forum?
[00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:34.160]   You have to do your own due diligence.
[00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:37.960]   And so somebody will come across in a forum, they may be very articulate, very reasonable,
[00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:43.600]   their name may be Anton Ivanov, and you have to figure out if what they're saying is not
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:47.880]   only making sense for your particular situation, but whether you can find that information
[00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:50.160]   and confirm it at other websites.
[00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:54.920]   I try, every time I talk about military benefits or pay or military retirement, I try to back
[00:37:54.920 --> 00:38:00.200]   it up with the source from either a study or from the instruction on the Department
[00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:03.480]   of Defense website or some other credible source.
[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:08.120]   And it's that way when you're talking about early retirement or investing.
[00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:12.760]   You'll go to a study somebody has done somewhere, maybe it's something as simple as a Vanguard
[00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:16.840]   marketing sheet, but it might be something more thoroughly researched, like the work
[00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:22.200]   that Wade Pfau is doing on the safe withdrawal rate, or some old stuff like the original
[00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:26.840]   Behnken thought about the safe max withdrawal rate, or even the Trinity study.
[00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:29.200]   So you have to read, you have to get familiar.
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:33.240]   I would not blindly go into an internet forum and say, "Oh, hey, great, this anonymous guy
[00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:35.280]   on the internet says I have enough assets to retire.
[00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:36.280]   Good, I'm done."
[00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:41.040]   Instead, you've got to go sit down and do your reading and do your math and figure out
[00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:45.800]   from a retirement calculator or from whatever books or whatever other authoritative websites
[00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:49.000]   you personally trust whether you want to do this.
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.480]   And it's not just, "Is the math there?
[00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:53.680]   Can I do this because the math works?
[00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:57.920]   Can I do this because a research study and a computer simulation say this works?"
[00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:02.140]   You also have to have a personal level of comfort that might actually be a bigger challenge
[00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:04.600]   than saving enough assets.
[00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:08.000]   And that personal level of comfort can take a while to develop.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.320]   You may figure out that you have more than enough money to last the rest of your life,
[00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:14.040]   but you still have to figure out how you're going to live your life and what you're going
[00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:16.000]   to do with your time.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:21.160]   And the joke on most of the early retirement forums is, "What are you going to do all day?"
[00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:25.480]   And there are other books and other websites to go to for that to help you figure out what
[00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:27.760]   your interests are and how you're going to occupy your time.
[00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:32.700]   And I think that being responsible for your own entertainment is a big challenge for some
[00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:36.540]   people especially if they identify closely with their job.
[00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:41.980]   That can hold up the transition and make it even worse if they're actually laid off or
[00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:43.500]   fired.
[00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:49.500]   So there's a big emotional component to retiring early that is very reassuring to get from
[00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:53.140]   posting on internet forums and reading what other people have to say about early retirement.
[00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:57.020]   But again, you've got to do your own due diligence, got to read, got to figure out if this is
[00:39:57.020 --> 00:39:59.380]   really going to work for your personal situation.
[00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:04.620]   I don't have many concerns about the personal finance issues or even like saving money issues.
[00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:06.180]   Those things are fairly simple.
[00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:11.500]   What I have concerns about are when people get into specific discussions on specific
[00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:12.500]   products.
[00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:17.140]   For example, there's a massive difference between one insurance product from one company
[00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:21.640]   versus another or versus from one annuity product to another annuity product.
[00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:28.400]   People often throw, I observe, many contributors throw the baby out with the bathwater and
[00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:30.280]   say, "Oh, no, you can't.
[00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:31.640]   Don't ever buy annuities."
[00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:37.520]   Forgetting the fact that Doug Nordman is living on one annuity right now called the military
[00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:42.160]   pension system and will have another one called the social security system.
[00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:44.320]   Doesn't mean that there's anything wrong with an annuity, it just means you got to get a
[00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:46.320]   good one and it's got to fit.
[00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:53.080]   And then the other thing is when people often get into legal advice surrounding trust, estate
[00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:55.240]   planning, tax planning.
[00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:59.360]   I used to think that the advice was good and then I learned.
[00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:04.320]   As I've grown, then I've learned, the problem is I just don't have time to contribute.
[00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:05.560]   So I love forums.
[00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:06.560]   I think they're awesome.
[00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:11.400]   I always just worry though, I hope people are backing it up with their own due diligence.
[00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:16.040]   It's a great place to gather ideas and to gain from stuff.
[00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:20.120]   I've learned so much stuff in forums that I can never find in a textbook, but got to
[00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:21.120]   back it up with some research.
[00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:25.360]   Oh, and you've got to learn the vocabulary so that when you do go talk to a financial
[00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:29.760]   professional, you know what questions you should ask and you are listening for the keywords
[00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:36.360]   and the caveats and other tricky phrases that might make you get the wrong impression.
[00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:42.000]   I always love people say, "Hey, I'm going to go talk to a financial advisor.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.600]   What options do you have?"
[00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:46.640]   Because man, it's the greatest thing in the world when a client comes in.
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:48.600]   I come from the background of a financial advisor.
[00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:54.080]   It's so wonderful to work with a client who knows their stuff, knows the questions they
[00:41:54.080 --> 00:42:01.680]   should be asking and allows you to spend your time showing off your skill and your knowledge
[00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:05.040]   answering something that's better than, "How do I save money?"
[00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:09.480]   Well, the other thing is you can educate yourself for free on an internet forum and then go
[00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:15.160]   into that financial advisor's office and start a project that may only take an hour to explain
[00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:18.120]   to you instead of five hours to educate and then explain to you.
[00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:20.760]   So it saves quite a bit of money just educating yourself.
[00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:25.120]   I tell people that financial advisors have to know a little bit about everything.
[00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:29.080]   They've got to be a mile wide and an inch deep on every topic of finances.
[00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:33.760]   But a person that is saving for their own early retirement, they only have to be an
[00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:35.440]   expert on their finances.
[00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:39.320]   They can be an inch wide and a mile deep on their own financial situation.
[00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:42.720]   That's all they need to talk about with a financial advisor is to know what they need
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:45.080]   to understand for their personal situation.
[00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:48.760]   They can get a lot of that from an internet forum and then confirm it with a professional
[00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:51.640]   if they're not certain that's what they want to do.
[00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:55.960]   They can gather some good data as far as points of concern.
[00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:59.280]   "Here's what I should be watching out for."
[00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:02.680]   Someone like me can say, "Well, have you considered this, this, this?"
[00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:03.680]   Work those things together.
[00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:07.960]   The key is the financial advisor can know your actual details.
[00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:10.880]   And that's the difference that I've observed.
[00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:15.120]   At this point, when someone says, "This is what you should do without knowing details,"
[00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:16.120]   I'm done.
[00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:17.120]   That's bad advice.
[00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:22.440]   Well, the more you lurk, the more you post on internet forums, the more you hang around
[00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:27.240]   the advice that people are giving, the quicker you'll be able to see who's just using absolutes
[00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:30.980]   and negatives all the time and they only see things in black and white instead of the shades
[00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:36.480]   of gray, others who are stuck on one particular topic and never figure out how to take a more
[00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:38.400]   nuanced view of things.
[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:41.440]   It takes a while to see that when you're on an internet forum, but that's why I like sticking
[00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:45.400]   with one for a while to understand the personalities and the backgrounds of the people who post
[00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:46.400]   there.
[00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:52.480]   Until we all start posting our tax returns and our salary structure and our paychecks
[00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:55.800]   on internet forums, we're all going to try to keep those details private.
[00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:59.080]   So you have to figure out what's right for your own situation.
[00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:05.320]   So the bogey heads grew and then early-retirement.org grew.
[00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:09.800]   Were there more developments after that that made a big difference?
[00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:14.100]   We started crowdsourcing on early-retirement.org forum.
[00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:20.520]   One of the posters was an entrepreneur and a guy in a tech business in the '90s and he
[00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:22.920]   had just retired early.
[00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:27.000]   His idea was that he was not going to completely retire cold turkey and never work again.
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:31.040]   He wanted to retire and do a little of this, a little of that, maybe some consulting, maybe
[00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:32.040]   some part-time work.
[00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:36.280]   He really didn't know what he wanted to do with the rest of his life, but he expected
[00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:41.760]   to live a life where he did some work all the time as long as he was capable of it.
[00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:44.080]   His name is Bob Klyatt.
[00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:49.000]   Bob went on to write a crowdsource book from the early-retirement forum called Work Less,
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   Live More.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.800]   That came out in 2005.
[00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:58.280]   Bob's pick on that book was one that he had a lot of personal stories in there from the
[00:44:58.280 --> 00:45:00.960]   posters on the early-retirement website.
[00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:05.760]   He also had a lot of advice from us, enough advice to the point where he went out and
[00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:12.500]   he paid a programming firm to simulate a different type of withdrawal system that no one had
[00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:14.880]   looked at until now.
[00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:22.680]   Bob was one of the first guys to develop a variable withdrawal strategy in retirement.
[00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:27.720]   What that meant was that you could retire and start taking money out of your portfolio
[00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:31.040]   at what you think was the safe withdrawal rate of 4%.
[00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:35.600]   But then if a big recession hit, you could cut your spending back a little bit and not
[00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:37.840]   have to cut it back too severely.
[00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:41.840]   Bob was able to actually hire a computer firm that could do the programming and do the analysis
[00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:49.240]   and show that in retirement, a variable withdrawal system would allow your portfolio to survive
[00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:50.600]   longer.
[00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:53.720]   Nobody ever been able to figure this out before because it's just too complicated.
[00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:58.200]   The original research on retiring assumed that you spent the same amount every year
[00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:02.040]   adjusted for inflation because that was the most the computer programming could handle
[00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:03.280]   back then.
[00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:09.980]   So Bob's contribution was nice to see a variable system, which is the way that I spend in retirement.
[00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:13.800]   No matter how logical or how experienced you are, when the market's up, you're going to
[00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:15.240]   probably spend a little more money.
[00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:18.880]   When the market's down and everybody's jumping out of second-story windows, you're probably
[00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:21.800]   going to spend a little less money in a recession.
[00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:26.720]   Bob also used that crowdsource model to get a lot of content for the book and that really
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:31.360]   helped him write it, was being able to have people email him stuff and he would try out
[00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:37.160]   snippets of chapters on us and he would ask us questions about the text or the conclusion
[00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:38.160]   of the book.
[00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:42.000]   The publisher had a hard time with understanding the concept of early retirement.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:45.960]   So he was able to show that there was a big forum where this was discussed all the time
[00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:50.680]   and explain to the publisher what was going on and they bought into it.
[00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:55.200]   When I saw Bob do that, I thought, "Geez, you know, the military service members that
[00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:58.400]   retire, they've already got a pension adjusted for inflation and they've already got cheap
[00:46:58.400 --> 00:46:59.400]   health care.
[00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:01.160]   There should be more military retirees.
[00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:05.080]   Where are all the military retirees who are going to do work less, live more?"
[00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:07.280]   And that's how my book got started.
[00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:10.200]   We crowdsourced on the same model that Bob Clyatt used.
[00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:15.000]   We got a bunch of advice and stories from service members and their families and veterans
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.160]   and military retirees.
[00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:22.680]   I would write a chapter and farm it out to 20 or 30 people and take their feedback and
[00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:24.160]   keep working it.
[00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:29.720]   I took it very slow and took it very leisurely, but over the next six years we wrote a book
[00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:34.360]   and published that as the Military Guide to Financial Independence and Retirement.
[00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:41.760]   Now, Bob has gone on in his, he calls it, semi-retirement to become a sculptor.
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:45.760]   Oh, he is an incredibly talented sculptor.
[00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:49.160]   He was one of those guys who always enjoyed high school art classes, but when it was time
[00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:52.720]   to go to college, his father suggested he should study business and get a real job instead
[00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:55.000]   of being an artist.
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:00.840]   So Bob avenged himself by retiring early and going back and starting his art.
[00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:02.560]   But he has done amazing work.
[00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:08.940]   He lives on a suburb of Long Island near New York City and he has a lot of art galleries
[00:48:08.940 --> 00:48:16.480]   around there that he exhibits in and his last name is spelled C-L-Y-A-T-T, Cliet, Bob Cliet.
[00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:19.280]   And look him up in the internet for Bob Cliet Sculptures.
[00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:27.280]   He does wonderful work with figures of people's bodies and people's heads and abstract, a
[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:33.120]   take off on a sculptor of a person or somebody out there doing something like leaping or
[00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:34.120]   dancing.
[00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:38.400]   He has figured out how to do amazing structural things with sculpture.
[00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:43.560]   I had no idea when I sat down to watch him do a video of how to make a head out of clay.
[00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:45.760]   I had no idea there was so much engineering in it.
[00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:48.040]   And Bob has done a lot of work on it.
[00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:55.120]   He's actually traveled to foundries in the People's Republic of China to build sculptures
[00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:58.600]   of his art three or four foot high.
[00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:01.360]   A head that big cannot be built out of just clay.
[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:03.800]   It has to have a bunch of infrastructure inside it.
[00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:07.040]   And then he's figured out how to do the metallurgy behind casting it.
[00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:10.560]   So he's just done tremendous things in retirement with art.
[00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:11.560]   And he's living his dream.
[00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:12.960]   He's having a wonderful life.
[00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:17.280]   And his spouse keeps having to bring dinner out to the art studio late at night after
[00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:21.280]   he's waiting for something to cool or he's experimenting with some new technique.
[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:24.760]   He has really figured out what he's going to do all day.
[00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:29.840]   And I feel the same way after I got the book written and published that I had never had
[00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:35.080]   a day when I felt bored or where I felt unfulfilled or had trouble figuring out what I was going
[00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:36.720]   to do with myself.
[00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:39.280]   And Bob and I, we immediately connected on that basis.
[00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:44.920]   And we've been good friends for the last almost ten years now.
[00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:51.640]   This to me is one of the things I love about early retirement is just not viewing it as
[00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:55.520]   a goal but viewing it as a milestone that I think of.
[00:49:55.520 --> 00:49:56.520]   It's a journey.
[00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:57.520]   Right.
[00:49:57.520 --> 00:50:00.640]   Because my observation, maybe you know somebody.
[00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:04.000]   I've had people ask, "Can you bring someone on who doesn't work?"
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:08.320]   And I'm like, "Well, the people who actually have the money to retire, they don't quit
[00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:09.320]   working.
[00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:10.320]   Now, they may quit working for pay.
[00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:11.760]   It sounds like you've done that.
[00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:12.760]   Have you done that fully?
[00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:14.960]   Are you doing anything that earns you money?"
[00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:15.960]   No.
[00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:21.440]   All the income from the book and the blog income goes to military-friendly charities.
[00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:22.920]   And there's a couple of reasons for that.
[00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:26.680]   One of them is what we're going to now start calling the Ivanov reason where you want to
[00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:29.440]   be completely transparent about your income and your assets.
[00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:33.640]   But the other reason is that it encouraged people to contribute their advice and their
[00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:34.640]   stories.
[00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:38.040]   I said, "Hey, if you help me write the book, then when we start giving the royalties to
[00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:42.120]   charities, you get a vote on which military charity gets the royalty money."
[00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:45.400]   And it really encouraged people to volunteer that I think otherwise would not have been
[00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:46.400]   interested.
[00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:47.960]   That is so cool.
[00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:53.480]   I love the crowdsourcing of books and ideas.
[00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:54.520]   What a cool world we live in.
[00:50:54.520 --> 00:51:00.120]   Well, you know that you can go out there and write an e-book and you can freelance an editor,
[00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:04.440]   you can freelance a cover designer, you can freelance a copy editor, whatever you need.
[00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:05.720]   And you can also crowdsource that.
[00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:08.560]   If you've got enough people who are happy to help, there are a lot of people out there
[00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:13.080]   that are retired artists, retired editors, retired copywriters, retired authors.
[00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:16.600]   And if they want to help you with your project, they'll contribute the labor.
[00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:19.560]   It's inspiring to them and it's fun.
[00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:22.680]   I also wanted to touch on, you talked about the variable withdrawal strategy.
[00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:27.080]   This is one of the things I love about the early retirement community is in general,
[00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:31.720]   the challenge that there's often a very different language that's spoken between mainstream
[00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:35.720]   financial advisors and the early retirement community.
[00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:39.760]   And what I think people often forget, at least in my observation, is that the mainstream
[00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:45.240]   financial advisor's job, it's so rare to find someone who's saving 10% of their income that
[00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:47.840]   you're almost excited when someone's saving 10%.
[00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:55.520]   Now you run across somebody who's saving 20% or 30% or 50%.
[00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:58.720]   It doesn't happen in a financial advisor's job.
[00:51:58.720 --> 00:52:04.080]   So you can forgive us if we're a little bit surprised when someone says, "I'm saving 70%
[00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:06.240]   of my income.
[00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:07.680]   What do you think about my financial plan?"
[00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:09.480]   This is not something that we see every day.
[00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:12.920]   And not only that, but you realize they're probably going to retire earlier than you
[00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:13.920]   are.
[00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:14.920]   Right, right.
[00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:15.920]   Yeah.
[00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:17.560]   And just because someone's a financial planner does not mean they're good with money.
[00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:22.880]   I know a lot of it sounds horrible, but it's the truth that I know a lot of financial planners
[00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:26.600]   that are close to broke.
[00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:31.120]   And people often forget that, I think, when I use the term financial planning, that's
[00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:32.600]   application of skill.
[00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:36.700]   Is an application of financial knowledge and skill to a specific problem.
[00:52:36.700 --> 00:52:41.640]   It doesn't mean that somebody has the same lifestyle goals as their client may have.
[00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:43.960]   It really bothers a lot of people.
[00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:48.080]   And right or wrong, I think if it bothers you, find a different advisor who does have
[00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:49.080]   that.
[00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:52.880]   I mean, this business is very much a business like many other things.
[00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:59.160]   But the point is that when you give me the opportunity of having a variable withdrawal
[00:52:59.160 --> 00:53:04.200]   strategy with a retiree client, where they're willing to adjust their income significantly
[00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:10.000]   based upon market performance, even though I certainly can design a plan that doesn't
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:14.560]   take it into account, that margin of safety is an amazing thing.
[00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:21.660]   And it just brings such a buffer to the decision that it relieves the stress on me as a planner.
[00:53:21.660 --> 00:53:27.440]   That's very abnormal, because most of the time, the clients that a planner may be working
[00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:31.440]   with, they're coming to the age of 65 and they've barely got it.
[00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:33.100]   And they're not willing to change their income.
[00:53:33.100 --> 00:53:36.480]   And they're not willing to change their lifestyle one bit, because after all, they've worked
[00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:40.620]   towards this retirement plan and everything is based upon spending a higher level of income
[00:53:40.620 --> 00:53:41.620]   in retirement.
[00:53:41.620 --> 00:53:43.680]   It's a very tough financial planning nut to crack.
[00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:48.800]   And so just the ability to learn to be flexible with expenses and live a great lifestyle on
[00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:53.840]   varying expenses from year to year, your planner will love you if you give that scenario to
[00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:54.840]   them.
[00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:59.000]   I don't think people anticipate that actually is going to happen.
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:03.440]   They see that they want to live the same lifestyle in retirement that they had before retirement,
[00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:05.560]   only they just don't want to have to go to work.
[00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:08.960]   And they don't appreciate that there will probably be a big spike in spending during
[00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:12.940]   that first five years of retirement, just as you all run around and enjoy life and travel
[00:54:12.940 --> 00:54:16.160]   and fulfill all the things you swore you were going to do as soon as you could get out of
[00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:17.360]   the office.
[00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:23.680]   But over the 30 or 40 years of a retirement, it turns out that by the time people are in
[00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:27.280]   their 70s or 80s that they've done most of the things they really wanted to do.
[00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:31.480]   Most of the expensive experiences have been experienced and most of the expensive objects
[00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:33.400]   have been purchased and used.
[00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:37.160]   And people start to focus on the things that are very important in their lives and they
[00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:39.760]   don't necessarily cost much money.
[00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:45.340]   And there have been surveys and urban studies, but it's mostly anecdotal data that says as
[00:54:45.340 --> 00:54:47.600]   you get older you tend to spend less money.
[00:54:47.600 --> 00:54:51.220]   And so that's a variable retirement withdrawal system right there.
[00:54:51.220 --> 00:54:54.100]   And nobody has really tried to figure out how to quantify that.
[00:54:54.100 --> 00:54:58.260]   And Bob, with his system, was one of the first to figure out how you can cut back just a
[00:54:58.260 --> 00:55:02.580]   little bit during a recession without having to take a huge whack at your lifestyle.
[00:55:02.580 --> 00:55:07.820]   I like the approach of having some annuitized income that covers your bare bones of your
[00:55:07.820 --> 00:55:08.820]   spending.
[00:55:08.820 --> 00:55:11.420]   Do you have to pay all your non-discretionary expenses?
[00:55:11.420 --> 00:55:16.020]   Do you have enough annuitized income to cover that during a big bear market?
[00:55:16.020 --> 00:55:20.620]   And if you can handle that, then you can handle all the rest of the surprises that come up
[00:55:20.620 --> 00:55:21.620]   in your life.
[00:55:21.620 --> 00:55:25.520]   You can even go out there and spend the money on a fantasy vacation one year and then cut
[00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:27.380]   back another year and make up for it.
[00:55:27.380 --> 00:55:29.060]   So that is very human.
[00:55:29.060 --> 00:55:34.640]   It's the way we all like to spend our money and measure chunks to cover certain activities
[00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:35.640]   or certain events.
[00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:39.700]   And we don't want to have to be a regular rigid computer program.
[00:55:39.700 --> 00:55:44.420]   So if a financial advisor can come up with a couple of rules, like Bob Clyde's system
[00:55:44.420 --> 00:55:48.780]   or some other types of variable withdrawal systems I've seen over the years, all you
[00:55:48.780 --> 00:55:51.580]   got to do is whip out the rule book and see what you can do and figure out how to live
[00:55:51.580 --> 00:55:52.580]   within that.
[00:55:52.580 --> 00:55:56.220]   It's a wonderful way to give yourself the confidence to retire before the traditional
[00:55:56.220 --> 00:55:59.220]   age and not have to worry about money when you are retired.
[00:55:59.220 --> 00:56:04.940]   Yeah, the safe floor, the floor of income is what we call that approach.
[00:56:04.940 --> 00:56:07.660]   That's the one I've always found to be the most intuitive for people.
[00:56:07.660 --> 00:56:09.900]   It really helps people make sense.
[00:56:09.900 --> 00:56:10.900]   I don't remember.
[00:56:10.900 --> 00:56:14.540]   I just went and looked up Clyde's book and I realize I've read it because I recognize
[00:56:14.540 --> 00:56:16.340]   the cover, but I don't remember his system.
[00:56:16.340 --> 00:56:18.580]   What was his system that he laid out in there?
[00:56:18.580 --> 00:56:23.340]   Well it's frequently confused with the Trinity study of the 4% safe withdrawal rate.
[00:56:23.340 --> 00:56:29.260]   And let me briefly mention the Trinity study's system is that you take your 4% when you retire
[00:56:29.260 --> 00:56:31.540]   and then every year you raise that by inflation.
[00:56:31.540 --> 00:56:36.200]   So the Trinity system, you start at a 4% withdrawal rate and every year you boost it by the inflation
[00:56:36.200 --> 00:56:37.420]   rate.
[00:56:37.420 --> 00:56:39.420]   Bob has a different version of that.
[00:56:39.420 --> 00:56:42.260]   Bob starts at 4% every year.
[00:56:42.260 --> 00:56:46.300]   Every year that you're retired, at the beginning of the year, you withdraw 4% of your portfolio.
[00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:48.540]   You don't even think about inflation.
[00:56:48.540 --> 00:56:53.020]   If the stock market was up the last year and your portfolio is up, you start in January,
[00:56:53.020 --> 00:56:57.060]   you withdraw 4% of that portfolio and that's the money you're going to live on that year.
[00:56:57.060 --> 00:56:58.940]   If the stock market's up, that's fine.
[00:56:58.940 --> 00:57:01.260]   You're not going to have much of a problem with that.
[00:57:01.260 --> 00:57:05.660]   When the stock market is down though, Bob gives you a variable system to soften the
[00:57:05.660 --> 00:57:06.660]   blow.
[00:57:06.660 --> 00:57:12.860]   If the stock market loses 20%, the nightmare scenario is that the following year you would
[00:57:12.860 --> 00:57:17.940]   have to cut all of your spending by 20% and people are not willing to do that.
[00:57:17.940 --> 00:57:21.940]   And Bob's computer research was able to prove that you could cut your spending back a little
[00:57:21.940 --> 00:57:22.940]   bit.
[00:57:22.940 --> 00:57:27.460]   So Bob's system says if the stock market's down, instead of taking 4% next year and having
[00:57:27.460 --> 00:57:32.100]   to whack a big spending cut, take 95% of what you took last year.
[00:57:32.100 --> 00:57:34.060]   Just take a little spending cut.
[00:57:34.060 --> 00:57:39.300]   And so instead of having to cut way back because the market was down, you cut back just a little
[00:57:39.300 --> 00:57:41.180]   bit from what you had last year.
[00:57:41.180 --> 00:57:44.900]   And if the market's down the next year, well, you just take 95% of what you'd spent the
[00:57:44.900 --> 00:57:45.900]   year before.
[00:57:45.900 --> 00:57:49.940]   So you're cutting your spending a little bit by a few percentage points until the market
[00:57:49.940 --> 00:57:50.940]   recovers.
[00:57:50.940 --> 00:57:55.900]   And then once the market recovers, you go back on the 4% of withdrawal every year.
[00:57:55.900 --> 00:57:58.820]   And if the market's flat, same rule, 4%.
[00:57:58.820 --> 00:58:03.420]   And what he was able to show was that over the 30-year period and even longer, that that
[00:58:03.420 --> 00:58:06.540]   variable withdrawal rate would get you through the bear market.
[00:58:06.540 --> 00:58:10.860]   The big problem with the Trinity study is that if you got through a severe bear market
[00:58:10.860 --> 00:58:15.900]   in the first five or 10 years after you retired and you were boosting your withdrawals every
[00:58:15.900 --> 00:58:20.220]   year for inflation in the face of that big bear market, you could chew way into your
[00:58:20.220 --> 00:58:24.660]   portfolio during that first five or 10 years and it would never recover.
[00:58:24.660 --> 00:58:32.300]   And one of the more popular threads on Radder's board is the Y2K retiree.
[00:58:32.300 --> 00:58:33.380]   And he's had a thread running.
[00:58:33.380 --> 00:58:34.720]   It's been 14 years.
[00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:39.620]   He's had a thread running there on the Y2K retiree who retired in January of 2000 when
[00:58:39.620 --> 00:58:43.260]   the NASDAQ was approaching its all-time peak.
[00:58:43.260 --> 00:58:47.860]   And this hapless retiree has rigidly followed the Trinity study.
[00:58:47.860 --> 00:58:53.140]   And every year he's taken an inflation adjustment on his 4% safe withdrawal rate.
[00:58:53.140 --> 00:58:58.180]   And by now, because he's been boosting his spending every year for retirement, he's looking
[00:58:58.180 --> 00:59:03.820]   at a withdrawal of about 10% of his portfolio every year just to keep adding the inflation
[00:59:03.820 --> 00:59:07.060]   adjustments onto his original 4% withdrawal rate.
[00:59:07.060 --> 00:59:10.420]   And it's become clear after 14 years there's just no way that his portfolio is going to
[00:59:10.420 --> 00:59:14.660]   recover from the damage that was done by the 2001-2002 bear market.
[00:59:14.660 --> 00:59:16.900]   He just took too much money out during that.
[00:59:16.900 --> 00:59:22.240]   And in the 2008 recession, that's more or less the final sentence on the possibility
[00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:24.960]   of his portfolio ever recovering.
[00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:29.260]   So Bob being able to show that you could vary your spending during a recession was a big
[00:59:29.260 --> 00:59:31.020]   step forward, I think, for people.
[00:59:31.020 --> 00:59:36.180]   And today, you can probably find five or six more systems of variable withdrawal rates
[00:59:36.180 --> 00:59:40.580]   with different rules and different systems and different processes.
[00:59:40.580 --> 00:59:42.380]   And there's even different ways to run a portfolio.
[00:59:42.380 --> 00:59:46.900]   I know people who are going to wait until they can survive on only the interest and
[00:59:46.900 --> 00:59:48.180]   dividends from their portfolio.
[00:59:48.180 --> 00:59:50.180]   They're never going to touch the principal.
[00:59:50.180 --> 00:59:53.900]   They're just going to keep working until they build a portfolio big enough to have the dividends
[00:59:53.900 --> 00:59:57.440]   and the interest that they earned from their investments support their lifestyle.
[00:59:57.440 --> 00:59:59.520]   And they'll live like that.
[00:59:59.520 --> 01:00:04.840]   Makes me wonder with this retiree, makes me wonder if did they set an age, this hapless
[01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:09.560]   Y2K retiree, and could they have adjusted it with him taking Social Security at some
[01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:12.720]   point and gotten that complicated with it?
[01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:17.140]   I think Social Security would eventually save him as his portfolio is running out.
[01:00:17.140 --> 01:00:20.140]   But that's what he'd be living on for the rest of his life is Social Security.
[01:00:20.140 --> 01:00:23.560]   So I don't think that a particular age was chosen for this guy.
[01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:28.920]   It was probably in his 40s or 50s, of course, the typical age group of most early retirees.
[01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:32.640]   But no, they didn't count on him being saved by Social Security.
[01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:33.640]   Poor guy.
[01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:36.760]   Oh, well, we will eulogize him.
[01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:41.360]   We will eulogize him as the perils of sticking to a fixed plan.
[01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:43.640]   Well, that's a neat system.
[01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:44.640]   I'm glad you reminded me.
[01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:48.400]   I need to, one of my reading projects for next year is I'm going to really dig through,
[01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:53.640]   I've read some of the literature, but I'm going to try to develop a comprehensive survey
[01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:58.160]   of all of the studies that have been done on safe withdrawal rates and see if I can
[01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:02.560]   bring that to the show and kind of talk through the developments.
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:06.240]   Has the movement grown, the early retirement community?
[01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:08.000]   I guess community is a better word than movement.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.800]   Has the community grown?
[01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:11.880]   I think so.
[01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:13.120]   It's grown that there's more people.
[01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:16.560]   I don't know if it's necessarily grown as a part of society.
[01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:20.720]   For example, the number of people who get on the Internet every year goes up by 50 or
[01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:21.720]   60%.
[01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:24.760]   And so every year there are plenty more people learning about early retirement.
[01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:29.200]   But I couldn't tell you whether 1% of society is interested in early retirement or whether
[01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:30.880]   it's risen to 2% or 4%.
[01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:35.400]   I can't tell you if the worldwide interest in early retirement has gone up over the years
[01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:37.880]   as a percentage of the humans on the face of the earth.
[01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:42.880]   I do know that with all the calculator tools out there that people are beginning to realize
[01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:47.520]   that as they approach an age where they might have enough finances to be able to retire,
[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:51.320]   they're able to convince themselves that yes, it is feasible, the math does work, and yes,
[01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:52.320]   you can do it.
[01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:56.200]   And you just did not have those tools back in the '70s or '80s unless you happened to
[01:01:56.200 --> 01:02:01.080]   cash out of a large inheritance or a business and know that you could live off those dividends
[01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:02.520]   for the rest of your life.
[01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:05.340]   Today, you can figure out your sources of income.
[01:02:05.340 --> 01:02:08.600]   You can figure out how you want to structure your portfolio.
[01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:11.840]   You can figure out how your assets are going to work together to give you your income for
[01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:12.960]   the rest of your life.
[01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:16.640]   And you can approach that with a high degree of confidence that even if you retire in your
[01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:21.320]   '30s, that you'll still be able to sustain yourself for the rest of your life.
[01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:24.720]   And plan B may be going back to work.
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:27.680]   And that may work for the years until you're in your '40s or '50s.
[01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:31.720]   But after that, the idea of going back to work may be less attractive and you may not
[01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:38.000]   have the skills to find a job when you're in your '60s.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:45.000]   You didn't mention in your timeline, you didn't mention Jacob Lund Fisker and you didn't mention
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.200]   Mr. Money Mustache.
[01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:49.800]   Did they add to the conversation?
[01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:50.800]   Oh, definitely.
[01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:56.600]   And you know, in this timeline we're discussing, we're barely into the late 2007, '08.
[01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:57.600]   So keep going then.
[01:02:57.600 --> 01:02:58.600]   Don't let me interrupt you.
[01:02:58.600 --> 01:02:59.600]   Keep going.
[01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:04.320]   I've got another phone call in 10 minutes, but we can keep going for hours.
[01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:09.160]   The next two big initiatives were of course Jacob Lund Fisker, who I think started his
[01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:11.640]   forum probably in 2010, 2011.
[01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:14.760]   I'm not sure exactly when he really came online.
[01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:19.680]   And probably 2008, 2009 now that I think about it, because in a couple of years he passed
[01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:21.640]   the torch to Mr. Money Mustache.
[01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:25.880]   But Jacob, of course, had learned the extreme frugality approach.
[01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:29.740]   You can either save up more money to support your retirement lifestyle or you can drastically
[01:03:29.740 --> 01:03:30.740]   cut your expenses.
[01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:33.200]   And that was a big step forward.
[01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:35.800]   As Jacob has said, it was never about retiring early.
[01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:39.880]   It was always about a sustainable lifestyle and minimizing your footprint on the earth.
[01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:44.920]   And that's what made it so easy for him to pass the torch to Mr. Money Mustache.
[01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:46.800]   That was early 2011.
[01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:52.440]   And I'd say that everything he's taken from Jacob and developed since then has grown a
[01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:57.000]   huge following of people that are happy to have somebody who supports their frugal and
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.640]   their green lifestyle aspirations.
[01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:03.000]   And oh, by the way, if you do this for 20 years and do it with more than half of your
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.400]   pay, you can retire early.
[01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:07.200]   That's just the icing on top of the cupcake there.
[01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:08.200]   Yeah.
[01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:13.840]   So something, there's a skill that Pete, I first, I don't remember, I think I originally
[01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:17.280]   found Your Money or Your Life was my path into knowing about it.
[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:20.960]   Because for me, I grew up reading personal finance books about, say, 15% and you'd be
[01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:22.400]   rich at 65.
[01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:24.280]   And then I read Your Money or Your Life.
[01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:25.760]   And that totally just surprised me.
[01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:29.760]   And I think that led me to early retirement extreme was kind of my entry into learning
[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:31.360]   more about it.
[01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:37.940]   But I think that the work that Mr. Money Mustache is doing, though, is although he's not as
[01:04:37.940 --> 01:04:43.940]   accessible as mainstream, he's a lot more accessible than Jacob was.
[01:04:43.940 --> 01:04:47.200]   And his skill with writing, being funny and engaging.
[01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:51.240]   And then the thing that I most appreciate, and sometimes I get concerned he's going to
[01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:57.160]   cross this line, but that Money Mustache is he steers away from a lot of the technical
[01:04:57.160 --> 01:04:58.160]   topics.
[01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:02.820]   So as a financial advisor, I would often struggle to say, "How do I get this concept across
[01:05:02.820 --> 01:05:04.360]   to a client?"
[01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:06.560]   And I would send him a Money Mustache article.
[01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:10.340]   And that Money Mustache article, a lot of times, was funny enough, but straightforward
[01:05:10.340 --> 01:05:13.200]   enough that they would read it and then it would make them think.
[01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:14.200]   And they would say, "Oh."
[01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:15.680]   And they would start reading around.
[01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:20.400]   And because he steered away from the technical topics, he didn't say, I mean, he did a little
[01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:22.800]   bit about indexing.
[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:29.120]   But he didn't say, "Here's what you've got to do," which is where it becomes difficult
[01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:32.360]   to recommend something to your clients because you have to give it all kinds of caveats.
[01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:33.360]   "Well, this here.
[01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:35.240]   Listen to this and this and this, Mr. Client.
[01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:36.240]   Here, read this book.
[01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:39.640]   But you have to ignore .7, 13, 14, and 67."
[01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:40.760]   And that's really tough.
[01:05:40.760 --> 01:05:43.880]   That was where it came to, I used to give away Dave Ramsey's books.
[01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:47.680]   I would carry them by the box and I'd have to give so many caveats that finally I said,
[01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:49.680]   "They're not going to read the book."
[01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:52.160]   So I was able to send them his blog articles.
[01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:54.960]   And I've sent dozens and dozens and dozens.
[01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:59.520]   And I've had many clients where it's just enough who his writing is the perfect fit
[01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:05.920]   for is kind of high income, middle class income, high lifestyle spending.
[01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:07.760]   And he makes it sound so easy.
[01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:12.760]   Like, "Oh, how crazy for you not to be able to live on $20,000 a year.
[01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:13.760]   What's wrong with you?
[01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:15.040]   You're a weak, flabby guy."
[01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:16.680]   He makes it sound so easy.
[01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:18.920]   And it's so funny, but there's a ring of truth to it.
[01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:22.600]   I had a lot of clients come back and say, "Wow, that really helped me.
[01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:24.960]   Now let's figure out a plan for me."
[01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:32.000]   And so I feel like he's probably done more to advance the cause for the early retirees
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:36.440]   than many others because it's so accessible for middle income professionals, which is
[01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:42.140]   in my mind where you have the easiest go of high income, high lifestyle, a couple of optimizations
[01:06:42.140 --> 01:06:44.640]   to the lifestyle, and all of a sudden, high savings.
[01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:49.320]   Well, it's very clear what's valuable to him, what brings value to his life, and it's not
[01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:50.320]   spending money.
[01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:54.240]   And that helps people figure out what brings value to their own lives and how they can
[01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:59.760]   cut their expenses and just spend the money on the things they enjoy.
[01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:02.000]   This has been a great podcast conversation.
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:03.000]   We should continue it.
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.000]   Yeah, this has been fun.
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.880]   I was just going to...
[01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:09.800]   Last question and we're done because you got to get the other phone call.
[01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:10.800]   What do you actually do all day?
[01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:11.800]   Yeah, what do I do all day?
[01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:16.960]   I start the morning, literally every morning, I check the surf forecast to see what I'm
[01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:20.520]   going to be doing that day because if the surf is up, I'm going to rearrange my priorities
[01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:22.380]   and go find some.
[01:07:22.380 --> 01:07:26.800]   But otherwise, I get up in the morning and I write, I work on an article or a book or
[01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:31.800]   a chapter or a post for the blog and I'll work on that for 20, 30 minutes or so.
[01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:34.880]   And then the rest of the day is free and I'll usually do some chores in the morning.
[01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:38.800]   We've got home improvement or yard work to do around the house and I enjoy a lot of the
[01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:39.800]   reading I do on the internet.
[01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:45.240]   I probably keep up with 50 or 60 blogs through an RSS feed and I enjoy catching up on that.
[01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:46.760]   I enjoy reading in general.
[01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:48.360]   It doesn't have to be personal finance.
[01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:50.200]   I'll read for a couple hours every day.
[01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:54.800]   And my spouse and I spend time together, go for walks, exercise, just everything else
[01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:59.320]   that everybody else does except I get to do it every day, all day.
[01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:02.680]   And if I need to go surfing, I can change the schedule and do what I need to do and
[01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:03.680]   catch up later.
[01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:05.960]   Doug, thanks for coming on the show.
[01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:07.200]   I really enjoyed having you.
[01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:08.200]   Thanks, Joshua.
[01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:09.200]   This has been great.
[01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:10.200]   Pretty cool, eh?
[01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:16.160]   Doug, thanks so much for coming on and for sharing some of the history.
[01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:22.520]   I love learning about it and there's more history there than I ever knew about.
[01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:25.320]   And what a cool way to build a life.
[01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:30.480]   One of my dreams is that from a young age, we can help more and more people be financially
[01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:32.360]   independent from an early age.
[01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:38.080]   Now whether or not financial independence is measured from the perspective of never
[01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:42.720]   having to work again, I think that's awesome and that's a really great definition.
[01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:45.800]   But even just the attitude of being financially independent and a little bit of money piled
[01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:50.320]   up can really make a big difference in people's career choices and to help people make a transition
[01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:58.320]   and stop doing mind-numbing work and be able to pursue the things that are of great interest
[01:08:58.320 --> 01:08:59.320]   to them.
[01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:00.320]   So, very cool.
[01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:01.320]   Doug, thanks so much for coming on.
[01:09:01.320 --> 01:09:02.320]   I hope you enjoyed this show.
[01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:06.120]   If this was your first time listening to the show, we'd be thrilled.

[01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:45.440]   Let's read another review on our way out, a short iTunes review.
[01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:48.160]   This one comes in from Cal Maniac.
[01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:51.600]   Cal says, "All steak, no sizzle.
[01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:54.360]   Joshua is genuine, intelligent, and an excellent communicator.
[01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:56.680]   His insights and perspectives are truly outstanding.
[01:09:56.680 --> 01:10:00.720]   He is data-driven, skeptical, and thinking about the big picture, yet very much down
[01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:01.720]   to earth.
[01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:04.400]   No gimmicks or other typical flashy financial BS.
[01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:06.200]   In one word, this podcast is brilliant."
[01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:08.520]   Cal, thank you so much.
[01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:09.520]   Thank you.
[01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:10.520]   That means the world to me.
[01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:11.520]   I really appreciate it.
[01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:15.120]   Thank you to each one of you who has left me a review on iTunes or on Stitcher.
[01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:16.560]   I appreciate each and every one of those.
[01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:21.680]   They help the show rankings from time to time for help to other people find us as we go
[01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:22.680]   on.
[01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:25.640]   If you've enjoyed this show, I'd be thrilled if you would consider joining the Irregulars.
[01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:31.760]   That's the membership support program which is how I've designed to support this show.
[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:35.960]   Details can be found at RadicalPersonalFinance.com/membership.
[01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:59.960]   Have a great day, everybody.
[01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:23.520]   Thank you for listening to today's show.
[01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:31.520]   This show is intended to provide entertainment, education, and financial enlightenment.
[01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:37.800]   Your situation is unique and I cannot deliver any actionable advice without knowing anything
[01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:39.520]   about you.
[01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:46.880]   This show is not, and is not intended to be any form of financial advice.
[01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:55.240]   Please, develop a team of professional advisors who you find to be caring, competent, and
[01:11:55.240 --> 01:12:01.280]   trustworthy and consult them because they are the ones who can understand your specific
[01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:08.280]   needs, your specific goals, and provide specific answers to your questions.
[01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:11.000]   Hold them accountable for your results.
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:16.000]   I've done my absolute best to be clear and accurate in today's show, but I'm one person
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:17.560]   and I make mistakes.
[01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:22.160]   If you spot a mistake in something I've said, please come by the show page and comment so
[01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:24.360]   we can all learn together.
[01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:26.560]   Until tomorrow, thanks for being here.
