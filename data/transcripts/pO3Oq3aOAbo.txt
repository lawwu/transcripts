[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.840]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.480]   - Welcome to the "Bogleheads Chapter Series."
[00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.240]   This episode was jointly hosted by the New York City
[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.480]   and San Antonio Bogleheads Chapters
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.780]   and recorded August 24th, 2022.
[00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.600]   It features a discussion on the philosophy of stoicism
[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.320]   and concepts of behavioral finance.
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.160]   Bogleheads are investors who follow John Bogle's philosophy
[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.520]   for attaining financial independence.
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.840]   This recording is for informational purposes only
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:27.760]   and should not be construed
[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.100]   as personalized investment advice.
[00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.680]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:39.240]   - What we're showing here, is that clear to everybody?
[00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.800]   Great, great.
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.400]   Well, thank you for the introduction, Miriam.
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.860]   And also thank you, Jim, Lady Geek for the help
[00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.960]   and getting this all set up.
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.600]   So yeah, what we'll be presenting on today
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.920]   is stoicism and behavioral finance, right?
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.200]   So one of the first questions is,
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.200]   how can stoicism benefit your personal finance goals, right?
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.720]   The connection between stoicism and finance concepts
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.400]   can help us achieve our personal finance goals
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.240]   and peace of mind, right?
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.000]   So this is kind of why we're here, right?
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.960]   And why we're presenting on this topic.
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:24.720]   So one of the ideas behind this is framing
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.280]   to help us make good financial decisions,
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.280]   even in turbulent markets.
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.280]   And one of the key ideas here is the idea of framing, right?
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.280]   Another big concept within stoicism
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.480]   is the idea of focusing on what is in your control
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.340]   and differentiating between what we can change
[00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.480]   and what we cannot.
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.760]   You'll hear what is in our control,
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.720]   that's something you'll hear a lot
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.680]   when people are talking about stoicism.
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.480]   Another idea here, which is kind of related to framing,
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.760]   right, is appreciating what we have
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.100]   more than feeling of misery over what we don't have, right?
[00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.360]   So learning appreciation.
[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.280]   Another is focusing on putting in our best efforts
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.480]   rather than defining success by the outcome.
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.440]   So the idea here being focusing a little bit more
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.320]   on the process rather than explicitly on results, right?
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.920]   Another idea here is kind of learning
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.840]   to control your reaction rather than letting the outcome
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.860]   define our experience and our reaction.
[00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.060]   And then also in finding strength and tranquility
[00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.480]   through objectivity and rationality.
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.360]   So a lot of these ideas you'll kind of hear us reiterate
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.140]   throughout this presentation.
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.320]   And then another idea is to identify biases
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.740]   to help us make better choices.
[00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:03.160]   And then another big idea is understanding loss, aversion.
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.640]   Next, Guri is gonna walk through the agenda.
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.000]   - Fantastic, thank you, Luke.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.280]   And similarly, thanks to the many people
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.680]   who helped make this possible.
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.160]   - Guri, could you raise your volume, please?
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.640]   - Sure, sorry, my mic was far away from my mouth, thanks.
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.960]   So similar to Luke's comments,
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.640]   many thanks to the team of people
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.280]   who helped make this possible.
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.520]   So as Luke mentioned, I'll cover the agenda.
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.600]   He just covered item number one here,
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.040]   which is how stoicism can benefit you
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.440]   with your personal finance decisions.
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.920]   Following this slide, I'll cover three early contributors,
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.000]   three Roman contributors to Stoic philosophy.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.160]   Luke will cover some similarities
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.240]   between Stoicism and Boglehead philosophy.
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.240]   He'll also cover a metaphor of a greyhound and a rabbit
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.880]   and the takeaway lesson to that.
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.960]   And Luke will also cover, interestingly, Seneca,
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.000]   one of the early Roman contributors
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   and a prolific writer, wrote to his friend
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.880]   a letter called "On Retirement."
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.700]   And so Luke will cover that.
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.920]   We'll cover an intro to Stoicism really high level
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.520]   for folks who aren't yet familiar with it.
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.640]   Luke will cover mental impressions and objectivity
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.440]   and through a working diagram,
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.600]   walk through a practical application
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.360]   of a lot of what we're talking about.
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.840]   Luke will then cover some of Jack Bogle's overlay
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.960]   on emotions and reason.
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.000]   And then I'll cover five slides
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.120]   on the philosophy of Stoicism in a little more detail.
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.160]   There's so much depth to Stoicism,
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.880]   but we want to keep it somewhat digestible.
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.880]   So we'll cover some foundational concepts there.
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.600]   And from that, we'll transition to behavioral finance.
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.680]   Specifically in the invite,
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.800]   a lot of folks would have seen the link to the wiki.
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.720]   There's a comprehensive summary
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.520]   of behavioral finance pitfalls.
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.840]   So we'll touch on a few of those.
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.860]   We'll specifically highlight some of the work
[00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.440]   of Daniel Kahneman, who won a Nobel
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.280]   for his work in applying psychology to behavioral finance.
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.440]   Then we'll close with some quotes.
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.320]   We'll post some additional resources like books,
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.040]   and then we'll turn Q&A over to the audience.
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:30.120]   And with that, we'll begin
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.960]   with three early Roman contributors.
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.520]   So they're not in chronological order,
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.320]   starting with Marcus Aurelius.
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.200]   He's one of the more famous
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:44.160]   because a work of his indirectly got published.
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.160]   So for context, he was Roman emperor for 20 years.
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.000]   That's a big deal.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.320]   He was the most powerful man in the world,
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.000]   given how sprawling the Roman empire was.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.500]   And he was considered the last of the five good emperors.
[00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:58.340]   What does that mean?
[00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:03.340]   So many emperors were brutal, self-serving, and destructive.
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:08.440]   Marcus, on balance, was very good
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.460]   for his community and the empire.
[00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:15.960]   And what we know from him as it relates to Stoicism
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.840]   is he kept a private journal to himself.
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:22.160]   These weren't notes meant to be published,
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.040]   but academics compiled them, translated them,
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.440]   and it came to be called "Meditations."
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.980]   So folks interested, and I'd highly recommend it,
[00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:32.120]   it's worth reading.
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.800]   His insights are timeless and super practical.
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:40.000]   You'll find, if you choose to read it, how relatable it is.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.520]   He went through so many struggles,
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.120]   as you can imagine, as emperor.
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:47.840]   And he just had these profound insights and practical tools
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.120]   to approach his obstacles.
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.760]   And with that, his guidance is still empowering
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.680]   2,000 years later.
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:56.640]   So that's Marcus.
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.600]   Next, Seneca the Younger.
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:02.280]   He's the most prolific writer of these three.
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:05.120]   He was a playwright, and he was also
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:07.920]   one of the wealthiest people in Rome at his time.
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:12.120]   The equivalent, he would be a billionaire for his time.
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.880]   He was an advisor to Nero,
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:17.680]   and for which he was ultimately exiled.
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:21.420]   But he was, as a playwright and prolific author,
[00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:24.780]   much of his work survives, and he was such a good writer
[00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:29.780]   that his contributions to Stoicism are longstanding.
[00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:32.700]   And the last that we'll cover here is Epictetus.
[00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:37.700]   Epictetus was born a slave, but he earned his freedom.
[00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:39.900]   And he became a philosophy teacher.
[00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:42.860]   He studied philosophy and became a teacher.
[00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:44.860]   And although he didn't write directly,
[00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:47.420]   one of his students transcribed his teaching.
[00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:51.940]   So his work survives and contributes to us today.
[00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:56.940]   So that's some context for the Stoicism
[00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:00.360]   that we have access to via original sources
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:02.020]   or semi-original sources.
[00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:03.400]   And I say that to differentiate
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.100]   from academics who write about it.
[00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:07.100]   Okay.
[00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:09.420]   - Great.
[00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:14.420]   Next, we'll be discussing some philosophical similarities
[00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:16.580]   between the philosophy of Stoicism
[00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:20.000]   as well as the Boglehead investment philosophy.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   Which kind of funny story when I was building this slide,
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.560]   originally I'd planned on talking about things
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:31.000]   that were strictly Stoic
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.480]   and things that were strictly Boglehead,
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:36.760]   and then just kind of talking about some similarities.
[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.040]   But what was interesting,
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:41.200]   I actually had a very difficult time finding something
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:43.120]   that could fit into this category.
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:48.120]   So I kind of was forced to revise how we did this slide.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.080]   I thought that was kind of interesting
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:54.460]   since the Boglehead tends to be applications and prudence.
[00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:58.560]   So the first, right?
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:03.400]   So within the philosophy of Stoicism,
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:07.080]   the founder of this was actually Zeno of Sidium,
[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.160]   who founded Stoicism
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:13.320]   during the Hellenistic era of Greece, right?
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:17.360]   So he was in Athens
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:19.460]   when he founded this school,
[00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:24.460]   which is one of the many schools in Athens at that time.
[00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:32.720]   And then of course, the Boglehead investment philosophy,
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:37.400]   which is based on Jack Bogle, the founder of Vanguard,
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:40.800]   who of course is a proponent of index funds,
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:45.400]   who lived from May 8th, 1929 through January 16th, 2019.
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:51.120]   One other thing I would note about Zeno
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:56.120]   is he lived somewhere around 334 to 262 BC, right?
[00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:02.280]   So we're talking about 2,300 years ago.
[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:04.080]   So quite a while ago.
[00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:06.880]   And some of the other folks that we had mentioned earlier,
[00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:08.360]   some of the Romans, right?
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:13.360]   That was 100 plus years AD, right?
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:17.920]   So we're talking about hundreds of years
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:22.480]   of the school of philosophy thriving
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.800]   within the Greek and Roman eras.
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:29.920]   A couple of similarities, right?
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:32.320]   We're talking about applications and prudence, right?
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.740]   Wisdom, applied wisdom.
[00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:36.240]   These are things that you find similar
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:41.040]   between the Boglehead and the philosophy of Stoicism.
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:44.480]   The idea of focusing on what you control, right?
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:47.240]   A lot of the wisdom that you find within Jack Bogle
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:51.200]   and his philosophy is really focusing
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:54.040]   on the things that you control.
[00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:55.920]   And then also there's the idea
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:59.000]   of recognizing human psychological tendencies
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.800]   and then changing your opinions through rationality
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:07.800]   based on recognizing some of your own self behaviors, right?
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:14.400]   And then there's also strategies to replace
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:18.240]   certain unhealthy and possibly irrational emotions
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:22.400]   and try to replace those by healthy and rational ones.
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:28.280]   And then another idea that these two groups
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:32.040]   tend to think similarly is spending time on forethought
[00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:36.840]   and preparation, as well as learning from the past, right?
[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:40.920]   What can the ancients teach us?
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:43.980]   Or if we look at history, what can we learn?
[00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:49.120]   A couple of things that we are not gonna,
[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:52.680]   well, I guess one idea that I do want to address
[00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:56.200]   is the word stoic, right?
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:57.920]   If you look it up in a dictionary,
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:00.580]   it actually kind of means cold and emotionless,
[00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:05.580]   which is actually a bit of a misinterpretation.
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:09.040]   And sometimes you have to,
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:11.640]   that's basically that that word throughout time
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:13.440]   has changed its definition.
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:19.400]   But really, so when you're talking about stoic philosophy,
[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:24.320]   a lot of times how they make this distinction
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:27.960]   is with a capital S is stoic.
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:31.380]   And this is in reference to the school of philosophy
[00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:34.280]   versus stoic with a small S,
[00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:36.280]   which is cold and emotionless.
[00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:38.160]   And what's actually interesting
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:41.400]   is practicing stoic philosophy
[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:45.360]   actually has the exact opposite effect
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:47.200]   of being cold and emotionless.
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:52.200]   It actually, there's recent studies that have shown
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:56.400]   that it actually makes people more warm and empathetic.
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:59.640]   So it's actually interesting how the definition
[00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:03.920]   of the word stoic can be completely misrepresentative
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:06.640]   of the stoic school of philosophy.
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:10.480]   And then, oh, one other thing, the word stoic,
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:14.040]   what that means, that came from the Greek word porch, right?
[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:16.440]   So they used to practice their philosophy
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:21.440]   on the porch of the stoapokile,
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:28.820]   which forgive my mispronunciation of that,
[00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:32.320]   but it's basically where they went and practiced philosophy.
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:35.120]   So really they were the group of folks
[00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:36.720]   that would go talk on the porch.
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:45.960]   All right, so next we're gonna touch on a metaphor
[00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:49.680]   that Jack Vogel, he actually used
[00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:53.960]   during a March 23rd, 2007 commencement speech
[00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:58.960]   at the New York NYU Stern School of Business.
[00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:05.220]   And this is a story originally by Reverend Fred Craddock.
[00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:06.500]   And interestingly enough,
[00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:09.540]   it's between the Reverend and a Greyhound.
[00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:11.840]   So of course it's a true story.
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:18.180]   So it started off, so the Reverend asked,
[00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:19.820]   "Are you still racing?"
[00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:22.580]   To which the Greyhound says, "No."
[00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:24.540]   The Reverend asked, "Well, what is the matter?
[00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:26.680]   Did you get too old to race?"
[00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:30.220]   "No, I still had some race left in me," said the Greyhound.
[00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:32.980]   "Well, what then, did you not win?"
[00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:35.900]   "I won over a million dollars from my owner."
[00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:38.720]   "Well, then what was it, bad treatment?"
[00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:42.460]   "Oh no, they treated us royally when we were racing."
[00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:43.840]   "Well, did you get crippled?"
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:45.980]   "No, didn't get crippled."
[00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:47.260]   "Well, then why?"
[00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:50.180]   "Why, I quit," said the Greyhound.
[00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:51.560]   "You quit?"
[00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:52.400]   "I quit."
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:54.680]   "Why did you quit?"
[00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:57.820]   And then the Greyhound responds,
[00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:01.340]   "I just quit because after all that running
[00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:03.040]   and running and running,
[00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:08.040]   I found out that the rabbit I was chasing wasn't even real."
[00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:12.500]   Right, so what's kind of the idea here, right?
[00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:16.340]   So we'll kind of pose a question, right?
[00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:20.840]   So, you know, what rabbit are you chasing, right?
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:23.520]   Is the rabbit you are chasing real, right?
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:26.900]   And so kind of the idea that we maybe wanna highlight here
[00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:29.620]   is, you know, perhaps it's worth considering
[00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:35.000]   if what you pursue is real and really worth that pursuit.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.680]   And that kind of gets into the idea of priorities.
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:45.660]   So next, we're gonna come into some sayings from Seneca,
[00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:49.880]   right, which this is on saving for retirement.
[00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:54.500]   And this is kind of a couple of ideas here
[00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:58.500]   is discussing financial wealth versus wealth of mind.
[00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:00.700]   So the first idea here, right?
[00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:03.780]   For many people, the acquisition of wealth
[00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:06.900]   is not the end of troubles, but only a fresh start.
[00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:07.940]   So no surprise there.
[00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:11.020]   The fault is not in one's surrounding,
[00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:13.560]   but in the mind itself.
[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:17.100]   Will you wait for interest to accrue,
[00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:20.780]   for ventures to pay off, for some fat inheritance,
[00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:23.940]   when you could become rich right away, right?
[00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:25.700]   Wisdom pays off immediately.
[00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:28.060]   It's wealth is bestowed on all
[00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:31.620]   to whom wealth has come to seem irrelevant.
[00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:36.500]   So trust me, you should make philosophy your out advocate.
[00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:40.580]   It will persuade you not to linger over your balance sheet.
[00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:42.940]   And so just to kind of keep in mind,
[00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:46.340]   this is around 62 AD, right?
[00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:50.740]   So this is, you know, just under 2000 years ago
[00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:52.180]   that we're talking about.
[00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:54.500]   And he's talking about these ideas, right?
[00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:58.020]   So kind of highlighting the idea that the, you know,
[00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:00.540]   the human condition, you know,
[00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:02.900]   it extends quite a bit into the past.
[00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:05.700]   And some of this wisdom that, you know,
[00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:08.960]   the ancients can teach us, it's applicable to us today.
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:11.740]   But there's an idea here, right?
[00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:15.060]   A distinction between financial wealth
[00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:18.500]   and the idea of a wealth of mind, right?
[00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:21.300]   The idea of, you know, peace of mind,
[00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:24.060]   your character, that sort of thing.
[00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:29.060]   And so the Stoics,
[00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:33.580]   they actually don't deem financial wealth
[00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:36.500]   as either virtuous nor vicious.
[00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:40.220]   It's something that it depends on how you use it, right?
[00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:43.340]   So you can use wealth in a virtuous way
[00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:46.980]   or it can be used in a vicious way, right?
[00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:49.820]   So it is treated in that way
[00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:52.040]   that dependent on how you use it,
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:54.340]   which depends on your mind,
[00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:57.900]   depends is basically how they would view wealth.
[00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:02.260]   So the next slide, we'll,
[00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:06.060]   Gauri is gonna talk about intro to Stoicism.
[00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:07.700]   - Great, thanks Luke.
[00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:10.860]   So again, we'll get into detail
[00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:15.540]   with some foundational Stoic concepts after a few slides.
[00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:18.560]   So the next two slides will be really high level.
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:22.020]   There's some debate in academia
[00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:24.300]   about the primary purpose of Stoicism.
[00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:28.220]   So we're keeping it pretty general here.
[00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:31.340]   One of the main concepts is to live virtuously,
[00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:36.340]   just like Luke was talking about how folks spend money.
[00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:39.220]   Money itself is objective.
[00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:41.020]   It's neither good nor bad.
[00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:46.020]   So virtue is the potential to pursue virtue
[00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:47.520]   is within each of us.
[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:50.740]   And the Stoics focused on four cardinal virtues,
[00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:54.020]   those being courage, justice, temperance,
[00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:55.180]   and practical wisdom.
[00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:57.520]   Temperance meaning moderation
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:59.060]   and practical wisdom meaning
[00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:01.340]   not just intellectual knowledge,
[00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:04.480]   but to put what you've learned into practice.
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:06.260]   They felt so strongly about this.
[00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:07.920]   They felt that just learning something
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:12.500]   and not practicing it was almost as good as not learning it.
[00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:16.820]   Another core foundational concept to Stoicism
[00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:20.940]   is that we can avoid unnecessary negative emotions.
[00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:23.700]   And I'll differentiate as Luke did
[00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:27.020]   that it's not about being emotionless,
[00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:31.560]   but Stoicism and even as Luke mentioned
[00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:33.860]   how it survived 2000 years,
[00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:37.840]   folks familiar with CBT or Cognitive Behavioral Therapy,
[00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:39.660]   which is rooted in Stoicism
[00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:42.800]   finds that we don't need to suffer
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:44.540]   through our negative emotions.
[00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:48.500]   We may experience them reflexively for a variety of reasons,
[00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:50.600]   but we don't need to stay in that state.
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:52.380]   Moving on.
[00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:55.340]   So again, academia debates is it about happiness,
[00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:57.620]   contentedness, some say tranquility,
[00:19:57.620 --> 00:20:00.500]   but the idea is similar enough
[00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:03.420]   that through Stoic philosophy,
[00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:06.260]   contentedness and tranquility are within us
[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:10.000]   and the overlay to personal finance or behavioral finances,
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.220]   obviously the substitutes of the market,
[00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:13.760]   how your portfolio performs.
[00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:18.160]   So we'll go into more detail later on that.
[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:20.400]   But the immediate practicality
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:23.920]   is you are able to empower yourself with tools
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:27.400]   that help you reduce worries and anxiety.
[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:32.400]   And as mentioned earlier, the converse of what Stoicism,
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:35.960]   we should talk about what Stoicism isn't.
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:39.460]   So it doesn't say that you shouldn't enjoy positive things.
[00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:41.220]   You certainly can.
[00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:44.860]   You can enjoy positive emotions and positive possessions,
[00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:48.900]   experience happiness, but not define yourself,
[00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:52.400]   your contentedness, your self-worth on these things.
[00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:55.020]   So you can enjoy a big house or a fancy car,
[00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:57.580]   even though bogleheads may be less likely
[00:20:57.580 --> 00:20:59.700]   to define themselves with those things.
[00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:03.440]   Stoicism says our character and our virtue,
[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:06.460]   our core and other things are,
[00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:08.860]   we'll get to a phrase called preferred and different
[00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:13.060]   so that it's absolutely okay to enjoy things.
[00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:15.260]   So that's an important clarification
[00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:20.260]   for folks who are attached to the kind of lowercase Stoic.
[00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:25.660]   And then Stoicism allows us to meet challenges
[00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:27.380]   with calmness and reason.
[00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:29.500]   So we'll discuss a tool for that,
[00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:32.900]   which is preparing for catastrophes in advance
[00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:34.660]   so that when they finally present,
[00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:36.720]   you're empowered to deal with them.
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:39.100]   And this will come up over and over again
[00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:41.240]   because it's so fundamental
[00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:45.160]   and it's focusing on things within your control.
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:48.100]   And part of that is how you respond to things.
[00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:52.860]   So in retrospect, we may regret having done something
[00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:54.620]   or having said something.
[00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:58.980]   And Stoicism reminds us that we're not defined
[00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:02.180]   by what happens to us.
[00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:06.740]   We're more defined by how we meet those things.
[00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:11.180]   So the path to that is pausing, reflecting
[00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:14.840]   and being thoughtful and intentional about how you respond
[00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:18.260]   and also separating yourself from those external events.
[00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:23.060]   And Stoic philosophy tells us that most things in the world
[00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:27.660]   are things external to us have an objectivity
[00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:31.420]   and we often assign our own judgments to them.
[00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:34.900]   We often label them as positive or negative,
[00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:38.020]   but many of these things in fact are neutral
[00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:42.080]   and minus our own judgments, they exist in that neutrality.
[00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:44.900]   So next slide.
[00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:49.900]   In summary, again, Stoicism is meant to be
[00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:52.200]   a practical toolkit.
[00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:55.640]   You can use it throughout the day, whatever challenges,
[00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:58.300]   and you can find equanimity and contentedness
[00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:00.460]   and tranquility by practicing a lot of it.
[00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:04.660]   It does get easier with practice like many things.
[00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:06.420]   And again, it's not intended
[00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:09.020]   to just be intellectual knowledge.
[00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:12.920]   And we'll leave off this slide with a quote from Seneca
[00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:14.060]   or a concept from Seneca.
[00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:17.740]   He says, "The outside world will not give us happiness
[00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:19.480]   or unhappiness.
[00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:22.620]   Our character is the only guarantee
[00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:26.500]   of everlasting carefree happiness or tranquility."
[00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:29.420]   And with that, I'll turn it back to Luke.
[00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:31.260]   - Great.
[00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:36.260]   So now we're gonna touch on a couple of ideas
[00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:38.600]   within Stoic philosophy.
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:41.380]   This idea of mental impressions
[00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:43.440]   and the idea of objectivity.
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:46.900]   And these fall within, they have the Stoics,
[00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:48.940]   they have different, they call them different disciplines.
[00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:53.260]   And this is the idea of discipline of ascent.
[00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:56.500]   And a high level way of thinking about this
[00:23:56.500 --> 00:24:00.220]   would be to only accept and act
[00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:02.940]   on objective mental impression, right?
[00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:04.720]   So what on earth does that mean?
[00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:08.280]   So let's kind of walk through that a little bit.
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:13.260]   So there's the idea of something,
[00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:15.780]   there's an impression on your senses, right?
[00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:17.820]   You hear something, you see something,
[00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:20.780]   that sort of thing, right?
[00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:24.940]   So for example, the news media says, sell, sell, sell.
[00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:25.780]   So this is, by the way,
[00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:27.480]   this is gonna be a financial example.
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:29.940]   So we tried to make this a little bit practical
[00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:32.620]   to kind of give an idea of what we're talking about, right?
[00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:36.020]   So then you'll kind of have a mental impression, right?
[00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:38.100]   So something outside of you
[00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:41.300]   and then an impression on your mind, right?
[00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:43.520]   And that's kind of where, for example,
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:47.220]   the idea enters your mind that you may consider selling
[00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:50.440]   some of your assets in a downturn or something.
[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:54.580]   And so here, what we're gonna show here
[00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:56.020]   is you have the external,
[00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:58.300]   things that are kind of external to your mind,
[00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:01.420]   and then you have what's happening internally,
[00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:03.320]   within your mind, right?
[00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:07.060]   And then there's this other aspect of it, right?
[00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:12.060]   So this is kind of a certain aspect of it, right?
[00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:17.360]   But then you kind of have your judgment and your will, right?
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:21.860]   Some of your more conscious ideas, right?
[00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:24.000]   That, so for example,
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.140]   you may have studied historic market resilience.
[00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:30.940]   You kind of understand market behavior, right?
[00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:35.940]   So then basically these two things kind of combine
[00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:40.100]   and result in this idea that you can either accept
[00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:42.980]   or reject this mental impression, right?
[00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:45.260]   So this is basically your judgment
[00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:48.460]   and your will evaluates this.
[00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:53.100]   And then you can accept or reject that idea, right?
[00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:57.180]   So for example, you may reject the idea of selling
[00:25:57.180 --> 00:26:00.780]   based on your knowledge of historic market resilience,
[00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:01.900]   right?
[00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:05.060]   So then you may take action or inaction, right?
[00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:06.460]   So in this case, right?
[00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:09.340]   Do nothing and you'll stay the course,
[00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:11.960]   which of course is, as Bogleheads know,
[00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:14.900]   is a very Boglehead saying, right?
[00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:17.980]   And then there's some type of outcome, right?
[00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:20.140]   And history has shown that this is,
[00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:23.160]   you're more likely to achieve your financial goals.
[00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:26.700]   Or at least that's one of the core tenants of Bogleheads,
[00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:27.540]   right?
[00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:33.460]   And that's, so the Stoics would overlay another idea here,
[00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:34.460]   right?
[00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:37.860]   So they're gonna say, well, guess what?
[00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:40.540]   When you think about this whole process,
[00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:43.660]   what aspects of this are in your control
[00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:46.980]   versus what things are outside of your control, right?
[00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:51.900]   And so what they say is your judgment and your will
[00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:56.220]   and its interaction with things that are outside
[00:26:56.220 --> 00:27:00.100]   of your control is really what you need to focus on, right?
[00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:03.620]   So their whole idea is to focus on things
[00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:05.580]   that are in your control.
[00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:09.820]   And all the practices, so Gorey's gonna,
[00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:13.500]   he's gonna talk about various practices
[00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:15.320]   that'll kind of help.
[00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:19.180]   They're all kind of intended to impact your judgment
[00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:22.980]   and will with the intent of allowing you
[00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:26.260]   to have better ascent, right?
[00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:30.180]   So an example that the Stoics often use
[00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:33.180]   was the idea of an archer, right?
[00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:37.140]   So what things is the archer in control of, right?
[00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:40.740]   So he's in control of how much he practices,
[00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:45.280]   where he's aiming, how hard he's pulling the string back.
[00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:50.960]   So like that's basically his angle of launch.
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:55.880]   So, and his steadiness, some of those things
[00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:58.160]   are the things that he's in control of.
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:27:59.200]   But at the end of the day,
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:01.800]   he has to release the arrow, right?
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:05.000]   And at that point, it becomes outside of his control
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.500]   and things in life can have its own influences, right?
[00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:13.160]   Wind, that sort of thing.
[00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:17.760]   And so where it ends up hitting on the target, right?
[00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:20.960]   Is that this is where the Stoics would say
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:23.240]   you are not in control of, right?
[00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:26.000]   You can do your best, but at the end of the day,
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.840]   there are still things that you do not control.
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:34.120]   So what the Stoics say is focus on the things
[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:38.040]   that you control and then do your best, right?
[00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:41.620]   And don't focus necessarily on the outcome.
[00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:44.780]   And then a couple of labeling,
[00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:47.900]   a couple of things on this diagram here, right?
[00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:49.700]   So the Stoics would say,
[00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:53.460]   you wanna focus on your center of rationality, right?
[00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:56.660]   This is kind of your virtue.
[00:28:56.660 --> 00:28:58.140]   This is where virtue is.
[00:28:58.140 --> 00:28:59.540]   This is where it lies.
[00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:01.980]   This is where your character lies, right?
[00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:05.580]   So this is where you wanna spend your time improving, right?
[00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:10.580]   And then the idea of the discipline of ascent, right?
[00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:14.400]   Is to be objective, right?
[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:17.960]   In what the things that you object and reject, right?
[00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:21.000]   And so a more modern way of thinking about this
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.240]   would be maybe some of your biases, right?
[00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:26.680]   You want to use objectivity
[00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:29.960]   to help eliminate some of these biases.
[00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:33.680]   And Gorey's gonna explain some more on biases here
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:34.640]   a little bit later.
[00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:38.300]   A couple of other examples of things
[00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:40.800]   that are in our control and outside of our control.
[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:45.740]   For example, and these are like Boglehead type examples,
[00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:46.760]   right?
[00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:48.280]   Your asset allocation,
[00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:50.680]   that's something that is in your control.
[00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:53.240]   Your investment policy statement, right?
[00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:54.680]   Typically you're gonna write that
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:57.920]   when you're in a rational state,
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:02.920]   not in a hyper emotional and reactive state, right?
[00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:06.640]   There's within the idea of lifestyle creep, right?
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:08.960]   So as you get older
[00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:13.000]   or as you basically your desires kind of creep up,
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.800]   you want a bigger house, a bigger, fancier car,
[00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:18.660]   that sort of thing, right?
[00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:22.520]   So this kind of ties back into the idea of desire, right?
[00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:26.840]   So there, and the Stokes believe
[00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:30.120]   that a large portion of your desires
[00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:31.960]   are under your control, right?
[00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:35.040]   And so that part of the practices would aim
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:39.620]   at trying to keep some of your desires in check, right?
[00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:43.320]   Some things that are outside of your control, right?
[00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:47.000]   And this is relevant to the personal finance
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.980]   that we're talking about here, right?
[00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:52.560]   Is market performance, political events,
[00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:54.380]   interest rates, inflation, right?
[00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:57.300]   These aren't things that you can control, right?
[00:30:57.300 --> 00:31:01.920]   So you can take action to mitigate these things,
[00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:04.400]   but you have to recognize that at the end of the day,
[00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:06.000]   you do not control these things.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:12.920]   And so Jack Bogle recognized a lot of these ideas, right?
[00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:18.720]   And in his article, "Clash of Cultures,"
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:22.120]   he kind of touched on a lot of these ideas.
[00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:27.120]   Jack was always very good with words and articulate, right?
[00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:30.440]   So he said that intelligent investors
[00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:34.640]   try to separate their emotions of hope, fear, and greed
[00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:39.340]   that separates the volatile market of short-term expectations
[00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:42.440]   from the real market of long-term intrinsic value
[00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:46.620]   and trust in reason to prevail over the long-term.
[00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:48.640]   And the last sentence here, he says,
[00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:53.200]   "In this sense, long-term investors must be philosophers
[00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:55.240]   rather than technicians," right?
[00:31:55.240 --> 00:32:00.240]   So here, you see Jack highlighting the idea
[00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:04.800]   of reason and trying to separate out your emotions,
[00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:09.800]   which is pretty on par with a lot of the things
[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:13.100]   that the Stoics say and try to practice.
[00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:19.440]   So next, we'll hand off to Gauri,
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:24.320]   who's gonna touch on the philosophy of Stoicism.
[00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:26.080]   - Excellent, thanks, Luke.
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:29.700]   So again, we'll keep it somewhat high level,
[00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:31.520]   but go into a little more detail
[00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:33.800]   with some foundational concepts.
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:37.960]   Again, the key purpose can be debated within academia,
[00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:40.800]   so we'll keep it pretty general here.
[00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:47.640]   Stoicism offers tools for a life of meaningful equanimity,
[00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:50.080]   reduced anxiety, and heightened virtue,
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:51.480]   which we spoke about,
[00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:54.480]   avoiding unnecessary negative emotions.
[00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:56.520]   And what is unnecessary negative emotions?
[00:32:56.520 --> 00:33:00.340]   So on the spectrum of emotions,
[00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:05.340]   Stoicism maintains that worry, envy, and regret
[00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:09.260]   are overall avoidable and destructive.
[00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:11.960]   So they have a purpose, and folks can say,
[00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:14.660]   "Well, I worry, so I prepare for things,
[00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:17.340]   or I preempt things, and I solve things."
[00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:22.340]   But again, to stay in a sustained state of worry
[00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:24.140]   is often unnecessary,
[00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:28.480]   and Stoicism helps us with that perspective.
[00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:33.140]   Another purpose of Stoicism is to enjoy positive things,
[00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:36.760]   but not rely on them with such a dependency
[00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:39.080]   that it affects your self-worth,
[00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:43.340]   so that you can enjoy these externalities, as we mentioned,
[00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:48.340]   but the phrase they have for these external things
[00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:50.260]   is preferred and different.
[00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:54.420]   So that can be good health, wealth.
[00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:57.860]   But while you'd say good health
[00:33:57.860 --> 00:34:02.860]   is fundamental to a content life,
[00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:07.140]   Stoicism argues that even without good health,
[00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:08.340]   you have your character.
[00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:10.620]   So as long as you have your character,
[00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:14.340]   and you can pursue virtue, you can do without good health.
[00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:19.340]   And it's easy to expand on that with wealth.
[00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:21.780]   Sure, having money is great,
[00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:24.460]   but even without money, you have your character.
[00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:27.500]   So it would take a lot
[00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:30.140]   to have your character removed from you.
[00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:31.940]   And there are many examples of this.
[00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:35.300]   John's Admiral Stockdale,
[00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:39.420]   his plane got shot down, and he was parachuting,
[00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:42.700]   and he knew that he was gonna be a POW for a while,
[00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:45.000]   and he said, "I'm entering the world of Epictetus."
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.220]   And he was the highest-ranking officer
[00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:48.900]   while he was in captivity,
[00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:50.980]   and he maintained his character,
[00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:53.580]   and through Stoicism, practiced leadership
[00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:58.580]   that also inspired the men who were also imprisoned with him.
[00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:01.060]   Moving on.
[00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:04.580]   Satisfaction in life comes from overcoming challenges
[00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:05.980]   and benefiting society.
[00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:07.980]   This last piece, "Benefiting Society,"
[00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:10.480]   is also foundational to Stoicism.
[00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:16.540]   They were encouraging of being active in community,
[00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:17.820]   active in politics.
[00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:19.780]   So it's not about being apathetic,
[00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:21.380]   and we'll talk about that more.
[00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:25.140]   It's about taking action to affect,
[00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:26.340]   I'll say noble outcome.
[00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:27.900]   There's a lot of subjectivity in that,
[00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:30.100]   but it wasn't to resign yourself
[00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:31.740]   and accept the world around you.
[00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:34.740]   It was to cause change
[00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:37.400]   where it was in your ability to do so.
[00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:40.580]   And when we say satisfaction comes
[00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:42.340]   from overcoming challenges,
[00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:44.820]   if you think about in our own lives,
[00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:49.820]   it's often something we overcame that was super difficult
[00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:54.640]   in whatever it is, personal, or career, or sports.
[00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:59.220]   Those things, we derive a lot of satisfaction from those.
[00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:03.140]   This next one, "Building Habits and Practices,"
[00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:04.980]   it's a reference to Seneca.
[00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:08.980]   He said, "How great is it to have a disposition to good?"
[00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:10.540]   So what does that mean?
[00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:13.820]   What if in modern day life,
[00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:17.540]   so many things that we enjoy are bad for us,
[00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:19.100]   or to a certain extent, bad for us.
[00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:21.340]   And so many things that are good for us
[00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:23.740]   take a lot of effort or a lot of time.
[00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:25.940]   And you could argue saving and investing
[00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:27.740]   is more of a marathon.
[00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:30.620]   It's delayed gratification.
[00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:35.220]   But within stoicism and within Boglehead philosophy,
[00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:39.380]   there are many things that are easily accessible to us
[00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:42.300]   that are entirely enjoyable,
[00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:44.780]   and also not particularly expensive.
[00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:49.780]   So listed here are some nurturing habits, like a lifestyle,
[00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:54.140]   where your natural preferences are satisfying and healthy.
[00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:56.360]   And examples of that are healthy eating,
[00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:57.820]   preparing your own food, right?
[00:36:57.820 --> 00:37:00.560]   You can derive a lot of satisfaction from that,
[00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:02.460]   and it happens to be good for you.
[00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:03.900]   Taking walks in nature,
[00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:06.060]   hosting a game night amongst your friends, right?
[00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:08.100]   These things cost very little,
[00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:10.220]   and they're super satisfying.
[00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:12.460]   Pursuing self-improvement.
[00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:14.340]   Stoics were big on journaling.
[00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:17.780]   We mentioned Marcus Aurelius kept a journal earlier.
[00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:20.980]   Meditation, not necessarily
[00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:22.420]   in the modern sense of meditation,
[00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:27.420]   but reflecting on the day's events in advance,
[00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:30.100]   as well as when I say reflecting.
[00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:34.300]   So looking at what you expect from the day ahead of you,
[00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:36.140]   and then reflecting on it at the end.
[00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:38.540]   These were common stoic practices.
[00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:40.060]   We'll end this slide with a quote.
[00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:42.340]   It is not death a person should fear,
[00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:47.340]   but never beginning to live, Marcus.
[00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:52.320]   And so we'll go to the next slide, dichotomy of control.
[00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:55.480]   Again, you'll hear about this throughout,
[00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:58.180]   determining what's in our control and what's not.
[00:37:58.180 --> 00:38:00.380]   We each, whether it's ourselves,
[00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:02.760]   or family, or friends, or coworkers,
[00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:04.700]   people are frustrated by all these things,
[00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:07.740]   but if they, or we, can separate,
[00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:09.740]   okay, here's a situation.
[00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:11.260]   What can we affect?
[00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:13.460]   What's in our control and what's not, right?
[00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:14.820]   It could be global politics.
[00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:18.920]   It could be something so much broader
[00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:20.940]   than ourselves and beyond us.
[00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:23.660]   If you're able to effectively separate
[00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:25.640]   what's not within your control,
[00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:28.260]   as Luke mentioned, market performance,
[00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:30.660]   we'll get more specific with examples like that.
[00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:34.260]   The concept is so foundational,
[00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:37.300]   and it's not exclusive to stoicism, obviously.
[00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:40.060]   The serenity prayer, which a lot of people know,
[00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:44.380]   grant us the serenity to accept the things we cannot change,
[00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:47.020]   courage to change the things we can,
[00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:48.900]   and wisdom to know the difference.
[00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:52.940]   The serenity prayer is directly rooted in Stoic philosophy.
[00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:58.200]   And again, stoicism is not about resigning yourself
[00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:00.040]   to just accepting the world around us.
[00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:03.780]   It's separating, okay, this frustrates me,
[00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:04.980]   or this brings me joy.
[00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:06.740]   What's within my control?
[00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:09.420]   So local politics, you can obviously vote,
[00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:13.100]   you can write letters, you can start a campaign,
[00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:14.420]   you can affect your community,
[00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:16.100]   you can affect your relationships.
[00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:19.340]   And to a large extent, you can affect your health.
[00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:21.980]   But stoicism reminds us that our health
[00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:24.020]   is not entirely in our control.
[00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:29.020]   So separate the two and take action where you can.
[00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:33.100]   And then you find comfort that you took action.
[00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:35.700]   And for those things that are out of your control,
[00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:36.900]   try to let them go.
[00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:40.580]   And stoicism will come easier and naturally
[00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:41.540]   to a lot of folks.
[00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:43.460]   Like some people have a natural affinity for it.
[00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:45.620]   Some people were practicing stoicism
[00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:48.420]   without knowing that term or that label
[00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:49.620]   for years or decades.
[00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:51.580]   Like you can go an entire lifetime
[00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:54.620]   living aligned with Stoic philosophy,
[00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:56.460]   just not knowing that label.
[00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:59.540]   And then there are other folks who will hear this and say,
[00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:02.260]   yeah, that sounds nice, but that's not really me,
[00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:03.500]   or that's not possible.
[00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:07.620]   So I would say, know that these tools are within you,
[00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:08.900]   are within your reach,
[00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:12.500]   but some people it'll come much more naturally to,
[00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:14.660]   and some people, if it interests them,
[00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:16.860]   will find it'll take a little more work,
[00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:20.820]   but they really are practical, effective tools.
[00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:25.340]   Another core, don't tie your contendedness to the outcome.
[00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:27.380]   So we take action.
[00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:29.100]   Lucas mentioned the Archer example.
[00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:31.420]   I'll reiterate it on the next slide, I think,
[00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:33.900]   just because it's so important,
[00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:37.500]   but know that you did everything within your control
[00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:39.140]   the best you could,
[00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:43.100]   and the outcome is not necessarily within your control.
[00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:44.900]   So we just accept the outcome.
[00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:48.940]   And you could apply that to portfolio construction.
[00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:51.780]   That's within your control.
[00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:54.100]   Withdrawal rate is within your control.
[00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:56.900]   Market performance, obviously, not within your control.
[00:40:56.900 --> 00:41:01.100]   So if you know that you aligned your goals,
[00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:04.020]   timeframe, risk tolerance with your portfolio construction,
[00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:06.780]   and you stayed the course when appropriate,
[00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:10.020]   if you find your asset allocation wasn't appropriate,
[00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:12.460]   that's within your control to change it.
[00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:15.380]   So those are practical applications
[00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:19.060]   of this core foundational concept.
[00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:22.540]   Another one, people think like,
[00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:25.060]   oh, so much of my finances aren't in my control,
[00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:29.060]   but to some extent, you can increase your savings rate.
[00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:30.580]   You can try to increase your income.
[00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:33.500]   A lot of people will say, oh, that's not within my control.
[00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:36.940]   You can often reduce your expenses.
[00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:40.260]   Fogelheads are completely adept at this.
[00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:44.220]   In terms of, I'll revisit the income for this last bullet.
[00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:47.500]   A lot of people think, oh, I'm paid what I'm paid,
[00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:51.260]   but you can negotiate a raise, obviously.
[00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:54.820]   You can work towards a promotion,
[00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:58.260]   and you can say that those things aren't in your control,
[00:41:58.260 --> 00:42:00.500]   and it's true, but you can influence them,
[00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:02.220]   and you can learn negotiating techniques.
[00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:06.580]   There's tons of YouTube videos or books or blogs,
[00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:09.700]   and a technique is at your mid-year review
[00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:11.700]   or end of year review, you meet with your manager,
[00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:15.860]   and you say, okay, X, Y, Z happened, and I expected this,
[00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:18.580]   and it may or may not have occurred,
[00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:22.100]   but can we agree on our approach for next year
[00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:25.820]   that if I accomplish X, Y, and Z and do it really well,
[00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:28.140]   that I'll be considered for a raise or promotion?
[00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:30.140]   So that's an example of something
[00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:34.460]   that is in your control applied to influence something
[00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:36.820]   that largely, like a promotion or a raise,
[00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:40.100]   can be seen conclusively is not within your control,
[00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:45.380]   but you can learn what tools are in your control to affect it.
[00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:49.940]   And with that, we'll go to the next slide,
[00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:53.620]   focusing on process and systems, not outcome.
[00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:55.540]   So we kind of touched on this,
[00:42:55.540 --> 00:42:59.420]   and Lucas mentioned the example of the archer.
[00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:00.540]   I'll reiterate it.
[00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:04.420]   So the choice of arrow is within your control.
[00:43:04.420 --> 00:43:07.100]   The quality of the arrow may or may not be,
[00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:09.460]   but you'll get the best arrow you can.
[00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:13.700]   The tension on the bow, the direction, your focus,
[00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:18.340]   when to let go, to send the arrow towards the target.
[00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:20.660]   A lot of these things are within your control,
[00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:24.580]   but stoicism teaches us that once you let go,
[00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:28.780]   that arrow and so many other examples
[00:43:28.780 --> 00:43:30.580]   that this applies to,
[00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:32.540]   that arrow is no longer in our control.
[00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:35.940]   So there could be wind, the arrow could be faulty,
[00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:39.100]   someone could move the target, any of these things can happen.
[00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:40.900]   So why is that important?
[00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:45.140]   We should not tie our self-esteem or self-worth,
[00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:48.740]   or in a lot of cases, portfolio performance,
[00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:51.620]   self-worth to our net worth, right?
[00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:54.380]   That for the things that are out of our control,
[00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:57.260]   realize that you did everything you could
[00:43:57.260 --> 00:44:02.260]   and what's out of your control doesn't define you, okay.
[00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:06.300]   So a practical application of that,
[00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:10.380]   and the following bullet, "Atomic Habits" by James Clear,
[00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:14.820]   highly, highly recommend if folks haven't read it already.
[00:44:14.820 --> 00:44:18.540]   It's an amazing, empowering book that helps you,
[00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:23.540]   whether it's going to the gym or pursuing a hobby,
[00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:26.220]   turning a hobby into a side hustle.
[00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:28.940]   So many things, they say,
[00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:33.820]   we overestimate what we wanna do in a short period of time,
[00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:34.740]   like a week or a month,
[00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:37.260]   but we really underestimate what we can do
[00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:39.060]   in a year or five years.
[00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:41.420]   And "Atomic Habits" lays out,
[00:44:41.420 --> 00:44:44.140]   as you improve your process and your systems
[00:44:44.140 --> 00:44:46.940]   and your efforts, that desired outcome
[00:44:46.940 --> 00:44:49.140]   that we keep saying isn't within our control,
[00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:52.620]   you improve the odds of that desired outcome
[00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:56.620]   coming to fruition just by improving your systems.
[00:44:56.620 --> 00:44:57.740]   Another important point,
[00:44:57.740 --> 00:45:00.020]   don't rely on willpower or motivation.
[00:45:00.020 --> 00:45:01.340]   A lot of people say,
[00:45:01.340 --> 00:45:04.420]   oh, I'll exercise tomorrow when I feel like it, right?
[00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:07.940]   We think our future self is gonna be more motivated
[00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:11.500]   or more agreeable to doing these things.
[00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:13.100]   It's just unreliable.
[00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:15.340]   But if you have the system, if you say,
[00:45:15.340 --> 00:45:17.300]   in the morning, I'm gonna do this,
[00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:19.460]   you're more likely to achieve these goals.
[00:45:20.820 --> 00:45:23.300]   And another important concept,
[00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:25.980]   and Marcus is big on this, he says,
[00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:29.660]   let doing the right thing be reward enough.
[00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:32.740]   So just know that you did the right thing
[00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:34.060]   and that should be sufficient.
[00:45:34.060 --> 00:45:34.900]   What does that mean?
[00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:37.820]   A lot of people do things for praise, appreciation,
[00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:40.020]   credit, public recognition,
[00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:41.940]   and then those things do or don't happen,
[00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:44.580]   or they happen to a lesser extent than we wanted.
[00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:47.220]   So stoicism empowers us by saying,
[00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:49.540]   those things are out of our control.
[00:45:49.540 --> 00:45:54.020]   Focus on what's important to you, meaningful to you,
[00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:56.420]   what you feel is the right thing to do.
[00:45:56.420 --> 00:46:00.300]   And if you do that, that is reward enough.
[00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:02.540]   So practical application,
[00:46:02.540 --> 00:46:05.140]   applying these things to your health, your finances,
[00:46:05.140 --> 00:46:07.860]   career, side hustle, et cetera.
[00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:10.380]   With that, we'll go to the next slide.
[00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:13.340]   And I will try to pick up the pace.
[00:46:13.340 --> 00:46:19.380]   So here we'll talk about premeditatio malorum,
[00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:22.060]   this is Latin for,
[00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:25.860]   it's basically premeditating on catastrophes
[00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:27.060]   or evils or troubles.
[00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:30.540]   So it's probably self-explanatory at this point,
[00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:32.740]   we spoke about a market downturn.
[00:46:32.740 --> 00:46:37.740]   So don't just imagine it as a remote possibility.
[00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:42.220]   As you adjust your lifestyle, your spending,
[00:46:42.220 --> 00:46:43.940]   your income, your savings, your withdrawal,
[00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:46.860]   your portfolio construction, think, okay,
[00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:49.980]   could I survive a 20% sustained downturn?
[00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:54.980]   What if the market tanked and remained down 20% or 30%
[00:46:54.980 --> 00:46:58.300]   or even 50% for X number of years,
[00:46:58.300 --> 00:46:59.900]   how would you handle that?
[00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:03.500]   So you could really play it out.
[00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:05.340]   You could do the numbers and you could say,
[00:47:05.340 --> 00:47:08.820]   okay, I parked this much cash or whatever,
[00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:11.860]   or you have dividend investments or other income sources
[00:47:11.860 --> 00:47:14.460]   so that you are equipped if and when
[00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:16.700]   that terrible thing happens,
[00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:20.380]   that you don't have to experience the level of anxiety
[00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:23.220]   that other people might or that you otherwise would have.
[00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:28.900]   Similarly, you can prepare for illness or adversity.
[00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:31.060]   This quote, sweat more in training,
[00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:33.260]   bleed less in war, self-explanatory.
[00:47:33.260 --> 00:47:35.060]   And Mike Tyson has a famous quote,
[00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:38.140]   "Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face."
[00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:42.020]   The Stoics would say, plan to get punched in the face.
[00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:46.540]   And with that, we'll move to the next slide,
[00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:49.300]   slide five, or rather.
[00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:52.380]   - By the way, credit to Gorey for that,
[00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:53.620]   by the way, that's great.
[00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:55.100]   (laughing)
[00:47:55.100 --> 00:47:58.340]   - Thank you, I'm sure someone else would have said that.
[00:47:58.340 --> 00:48:00.460]   So framing, very important here.
[00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:03.180]   A lot of this is probably intuitive,
[00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:07.900]   just that using your ability to change your perspective
[00:48:07.900 --> 00:48:10.460]   to your advantage can be very powerful.
[00:48:10.460 --> 00:48:15.460]   So if you view obstacles as opportunities to improve,
[00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:18.100]   you can be strengthened by them.
[00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:20.220]   And you can also respond with virtue.
[00:48:20.220 --> 00:48:22.340]   And there are many examples of this.
[00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:27.340]   And I'm sure every person has some challenge
[00:48:27.340 --> 00:48:30.460]   they experienced in their life where they met that challenge
[00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:32.180]   and exited stronger.
[00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:36.500]   And a lot of people will say life was better
[00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:38.980]   on the other side of that challenge.
[00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:42.660]   Marcus talks about this in meditations
[00:48:42.660 --> 00:48:45.900]   that are reflexive reaction.
[00:48:45.900 --> 00:48:50.020]   You could feel overwhelmed or you could feel self-pity.
[00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:52.540]   Charlie Munger will say self-pity
[00:48:52.540 --> 00:48:54.380]   is one of the most useless emotions.
[00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:56.020]   But again, these are reflexive.
[00:48:56.020 --> 00:48:58.980]   So we can't expect ourselves to not experience them.
[00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:03.220]   But the tool to apply here is Marcus would say,
[00:49:03.220 --> 00:49:06.100]   who better than me to handle this, right?
[00:49:06.100 --> 00:49:09.500]   He was in a position of power and influence.
[00:49:09.500 --> 00:49:13.100]   And instead of dwelling in this feeling
[00:49:13.100 --> 00:49:15.900]   of being overwhelmed, he said, okay,
[00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:17.660]   what can I do to make this better?
[00:49:17.660 --> 00:49:20.660]   And who better than me to solve this?
[00:49:20.660 --> 00:49:25.100]   And we can each find things in our life to apply that to.
[00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:27.660]   In the FIRE community, there's a well-known phrase
[00:49:27.660 --> 00:49:29.340]   called one more year syndrome.
[00:49:29.340 --> 00:49:32.820]   A lot of people who make good incomes
[00:49:32.820 --> 00:49:34.220]   have significant savings.
[00:49:34.220 --> 00:49:36.540]   They've mapped out via spreadsheets
[00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:39.740]   and they think with a high probability
[00:49:39.740 --> 00:49:42.260]   they can retire early.
[00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:45.300]   But then they say, I'll work for one more year, just in case.
[00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:47.580]   I'll save up one more year of income
[00:49:47.580 --> 00:49:49.500]   for that additional buffer.
[00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:51.260]   And perhaps there's nothing wrong with them.
[00:49:51.260 --> 00:49:54.020]   Perhaps that's the right choice for them.
[00:49:54.020 --> 00:49:57.660]   But using framing, we could say,
[00:49:57.660 --> 00:50:01.980]   what's the worst that could happen if you stopped working?
[00:50:01.980 --> 00:50:03.620]   You could probably go back to work
[00:50:03.620 --> 00:50:07.140]   so that if you, and this is exhaustively studied,
[00:50:07.140 --> 00:50:10.100]   a lot of people say they wish they retired early.
[00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:12.100]   And there are many reasons for that.
[00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:15.180]   But a lot of people don't act on that.
[00:50:15.180 --> 00:50:17.460]   And they stay working.
[00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:19.300]   And then when they finally retire,
[00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:21.780]   they say, oh, I'm not physically able
[00:50:21.780 --> 00:50:26.380]   or I'm not whatever, it could be capacity
[00:50:26.380 --> 00:50:27.420]   or family or friends.
[00:50:27.420 --> 00:50:29.220]   They're not able to enjoy life
[00:50:29.220 --> 00:50:33.340]   to the extent they would have had they retired early.
[00:50:33.340 --> 00:50:36.740]   And you could apply that to many other things.
[00:50:36.740 --> 00:50:38.220]   I'll try to pick up the pace
[00:50:38.220 --> 00:50:40.060]   'cause we still have a lot to cover.
[00:50:40.060 --> 00:50:41.540]   Feeling grateful for what you have.
[00:50:41.540 --> 00:50:43.820]   This is obviously not limited to stoicism.
[00:50:43.820 --> 00:50:48.620]   This is found in probably all of the world's philosophies.
[00:50:48.620 --> 00:50:50.820]   Realize that we take things for granted.
[00:50:50.820 --> 00:50:52.340]   That seems to be human nature.
[00:50:52.340 --> 00:50:54.980]   But if you zoom out from your own life
[00:50:54.980 --> 00:50:58.180]   and see how others would see you from far away
[00:50:58.180 --> 00:51:00.500]   or from way up above,
[00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:04.780]   we each have many things to feel appreciative of
[00:51:04.780 --> 00:51:06.380]   and grateful for.
[00:51:06.380 --> 00:51:08.460]   And more specifically, I feel this is factual,
[00:51:08.460 --> 00:51:09.540]   it sounds exaggerated,
[00:51:09.540 --> 00:51:13.620]   but several billion people around the planet
[00:51:13.620 --> 00:51:16.780]   would probably trade their life for yours.
[00:51:16.780 --> 00:51:18.620]   Your comforts, your conveniences,
[00:51:18.620 --> 00:51:21.620]   your access to healthcare or amenities.
[00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:23.820]   These are things we so take for granted
[00:51:23.820 --> 00:51:25.220]   we lose sight of it day to day.
[00:51:25.220 --> 00:51:29.300]   But other people would give a lot
[00:51:29.300 --> 00:51:31.220]   to have what we take for granted.
[00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:36.180]   And overlaying that to as recently as 100 years ago,
[00:51:36.180 --> 00:51:41.180]   some kings had less quality of life than we have today,
[00:51:41.180 --> 00:51:47.140]   be it running water or effective medicine.
[00:51:47.140 --> 00:51:49.900]   So these are things that even the most powerful,
[00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:53.100]   the wealthiest people in the world 100 years ago
[00:51:53.100 --> 00:51:55.140]   didn't have that we have.
[00:51:56.580 --> 00:51:59.940]   And then the last, I'll skip to the last bullet,
[00:51:59.940 --> 00:52:02.260]   imagine you died or were severely injured
[00:52:02.260 --> 00:52:03.460]   or had something taken away.
[00:52:03.460 --> 00:52:06.340]   It could be a family member, a loved one.
[00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:07.820]   Sam Harris talks about this.
[00:52:07.820 --> 00:52:11.580]   He says, they're around a dinner table and the family,
[00:52:11.580 --> 00:52:12.780]   everyone was on their phone,
[00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:15.060]   everyone was depressed and sullen.
[00:52:15.060 --> 00:52:17.420]   And he joined in that mindset.
[00:52:17.420 --> 00:52:20.220]   And then he kind of zoomed out and he said,
[00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:21.340]   you know, what if something,
[00:52:21.340 --> 00:52:22.860]   what if I died tonight, right?
[00:52:22.860 --> 00:52:24.420]   That could happen to any of us.
[00:52:25.340 --> 00:52:27.380]   He would give anything for this moment
[00:52:27.380 --> 00:52:30.500]   to be with his family, to have a quiet basic dinner.
[00:52:30.500 --> 00:52:34.100]   So with that framing, that's the tool here,
[00:52:34.100 --> 00:52:38.020]   he was able to re-engage and appreciate what he had.
[00:52:38.020 --> 00:52:43.820]   So with that, we'll move to behavioral finance.
[00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:47.860]   So hopefully people found philosophy of stoicism
[00:52:47.860 --> 00:52:49.940]   relatable, practical.
[00:52:49.940 --> 00:52:53.820]   There are tools that we can use throughout the day,
[00:52:53.820 --> 00:52:56.180]   any day throughout our lives.
[00:52:56.180 --> 00:52:59.260]   And the overlap with behavioral finance,
[00:52:59.260 --> 00:53:04.100]   hopefully people previewed this Wiki page.
[00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:06.940]   The link is here and it was in the invite.
[00:53:06.940 --> 00:53:09.580]   Listed on the screen are common pitfalls.
[00:53:09.580 --> 00:53:12.740]   On the next slide, we'll talk more about anchoring
[00:53:12.740 --> 00:53:15.660]   and loss aversion more specifically.
[00:53:15.660 --> 00:53:20.660]   But these behavioral pitfalls are so embedded in us
[00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:23.780]   and in our daily lives that we don't realize
[00:53:23.780 --> 00:53:25.100]   they're going on.
[00:53:25.100 --> 00:53:28.540]   And what behavioral finance teaches us is,
[00:53:28.540 --> 00:53:32.100]   these are unconscious biases a lot of times, right?
[00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:35.340]   If you ask the average person or even ourselves,
[00:53:35.340 --> 00:53:40.060]   are you being rational, factual, logical, objective?
[00:53:40.060 --> 00:53:41.620]   A lot of times we would say yes,
[00:53:41.620 --> 00:53:45.300]   many instances we would say no by intent.
[00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:47.740]   But a lot of times our decision-making,
[00:53:47.740 --> 00:53:52.380]   we think we're being rational, factual, logical.
[00:53:52.380 --> 00:53:53.940]   And it's just not the case.
[00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:56.540]   So behavioral finance has studied this
[00:53:56.540 --> 00:54:01.460]   and teaches us about these biases in more detail.
[00:54:01.460 --> 00:54:04.460]   So highly encourage people to get more familiar
[00:54:04.460 --> 00:54:05.540]   via the Wiki page.
[00:54:05.540 --> 00:54:08.660]   And there are many online resources about this.
[00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:11.220]   Just high level confirmation bias.
[00:54:11.220 --> 00:54:15.420]   Search engines are a huge example of this,
[00:54:15.420 --> 00:54:19.940]   that we are more likely to Google something
[00:54:19.940 --> 00:54:21.380]   the way we phrase it,
[00:54:22.380 --> 00:54:26.700]   the result will more likely confirm our existing beliefs.
[00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:29.660]   And we would often benefit
[00:54:29.660 --> 00:54:32.060]   by seeking out disconfirming evidence.
[00:54:32.060 --> 00:54:36.380]   So we need to be aware that sometimes,
[00:54:36.380 --> 00:54:37.220]   it's well-known now,
[00:54:37.220 --> 00:54:39.340]   especially in the political environment,
[00:54:39.340 --> 00:54:40.900]   a lot of us live in echo chambers.
[00:54:40.900 --> 00:54:44.500]   So it's important to realize
[00:54:44.500 --> 00:54:48.220]   that we are kind of hindering
[00:54:48.220 --> 00:54:50.820]   the broadening of our perspective
[00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:54.620]   with something as simple as a search engine.
[00:54:54.620 --> 00:54:55.460]   - Yeah.
[00:54:55.460 --> 00:54:57.660]   Well, on the confirmation bias,
[00:54:57.660 --> 00:55:00.940]   Gauri, I was just gonna point out,
[00:55:00.940 --> 00:55:03.620]   just think, imagine the tool,
[00:55:03.620 --> 00:55:06.260]   the Boglehead forum is, right?
[00:55:06.260 --> 00:55:10.020]   In terms of challenging your confirmation bias, right?
[00:55:10.020 --> 00:55:13.940]   Stating, hey, these are the advantages, disadvantages,
[00:55:13.940 --> 00:55:18.660]   and having debate, people having healthy challenges, right?
[00:55:18.660 --> 00:55:22.860]   So it's, I mean, just what a wonderful resource we have
[00:55:22.860 --> 00:55:25.820]   in modern day life to have somewhere
[00:55:25.820 --> 00:55:30.060]   where you can have the internet poke holes
[00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:34.580]   in a lot of these behavioral pitfalls, right?
[00:55:34.580 --> 00:55:37.620]   Is my logic clear?
[00:55:37.620 --> 00:55:39.580]   Am I reasoning properly, right?
[00:55:39.580 --> 00:55:40.860]   During market downturns, right?
[00:55:40.860 --> 00:55:43.540]   You see, there's actually more people
[00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:48.180]   visit the Boglehead forum during market downturns, right?
[00:55:48.180 --> 00:55:53.180]   Is that, basically, folks who use it as a tool
[00:55:53.180 --> 00:55:59.820]   to help mitigate some of these behavioral pitfalls
[00:55:59.820 --> 00:56:02.820]   that are known to plague humans
[00:56:02.820 --> 00:56:05.700]   and our behavior towards personal finance.
[00:56:05.700 --> 00:56:08.100]   - Excellent point.
[00:56:08.100 --> 00:56:12.460]   I'll mention two others on this slide
[00:56:12.460 --> 00:56:14.180]   before we go to the next slide.
[00:56:14.180 --> 00:56:16.540]   One, framing effect.
[00:56:16.540 --> 00:56:18.460]   I'll share a recent personal example,
[00:56:18.460 --> 00:56:19.940]   and this will be less finance,
[00:56:19.940 --> 00:56:21.540]   but the importance of framing.
[00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:25.180]   So my wife and I went on a retreat a few weekends ago
[00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:29.300]   to a few hours north of New York City, really scenic place.
[00:56:29.300 --> 00:56:31.460]   We were with a great group.
[00:56:31.460 --> 00:56:33.340]   It was actually on stoicism.
[00:56:33.340 --> 00:56:37.020]   And one of the attendees flew in from Denver
[00:56:37.020 --> 00:56:39.380]   and his flight got canceled.
[00:56:39.380 --> 00:56:43.940]   Fortunately, we exchanged info, contact info,
[00:56:43.940 --> 00:56:48.660]   before we parted and he ended up staying with us.
[00:56:48.660 --> 00:56:52.300]   His flight from Newark got completely canceled
[00:56:52.300 --> 00:56:55.500]   and they put him on a flight out of LaGuardia,
[00:56:55.500 --> 00:57:00.500]   which is closer to where we live within New York City.
[00:57:00.500 --> 00:57:02.260]   So he ended up staying with us
[00:57:02.260 --> 00:57:06.300]   and he had time in the morning to enjoy New York City.
[00:57:06.300 --> 00:57:09.260]   So we went to the Metropolitan Museum of Art
[00:57:09.260 --> 00:57:11.820]   and we just had a nice time spending time with him.
[00:57:11.820 --> 00:57:13.700]   We had a healthy meal together.
[00:57:13.700 --> 00:57:18.700]   And he wrote that he could easily have been so upset
[00:57:18.700 --> 00:57:20.580]   about the canceled flight
[00:57:20.580 --> 00:57:21.660]   and he could have been screaming
[00:57:21.660 --> 00:57:23.860]   just like so many other people in the airport,
[00:57:23.860 --> 00:57:25.420]   but he reframed it,
[00:57:25.420 --> 00:57:29.860]   that he got better memories from his flight being canceled
[00:57:29.860 --> 00:57:31.860]   than he would have otherwise.
[00:57:31.860 --> 00:57:35.300]   Okay, and the last one I'll talk about on this slide
[00:57:35.300 --> 00:57:36.380]   is recency bias.
[00:57:36.380 --> 00:57:38.780]   You see it in the third column, second from the bottom.
[00:57:38.780 --> 00:57:40.900]   A clear example of this is
[00:57:40.900 --> 00:57:45.900]   how we sometimes instinctively react to a market downturn
[00:57:45.900 --> 00:57:50.220]   or sometimes a bubble fueled by euphoria, right?
[00:57:50.220 --> 00:57:54.580]   Although we know the market's performance over decades
[00:57:54.580 --> 00:57:56.060]   that it keeps chugging along,
[00:57:56.060 --> 00:57:59.460]   despite World War I, World War II, recessions,
[00:57:59.460 --> 00:58:03.740]   depression, COVID, tech bubble, housing bubble,
[00:58:03.740 --> 00:58:05.500]   the market trends upwards.
[00:58:05.500 --> 00:58:10.500]   But recency bias, if the news like Lucas's slide,
[00:58:10.700 --> 00:58:13.220]   the media says sell, sell, sell,
[00:58:13.220 --> 00:58:15.740]   recency bias is so powerful,
[00:58:15.740 --> 00:58:19.860]   it can override our conscious decision-making
[00:58:19.860 --> 00:58:24.860]   because we believe this,
[00:58:24.860 --> 00:58:27.300]   recency bias is so powerful,
[00:58:27.300 --> 00:58:29.860]   the belief can override our logic.
[00:58:29.860 --> 00:58:32.380]   And the same is on an uptrend, right?
[00:58:32.380 --> 00:58:35.540]   We can believe in this euphoric bubble
[00:58:35.540 --> 00:58:39.140]   and often people enter just before the peak.
[00:58:39.980 --> 00:58:43.020]   So with that, again, we encourage folks to visit that,
[00:58:43.020 --> 00:58:46.420]   to start at least with this Wiki page.
[00:58:46.420 --> 00:58:48.260]   With that, we'll go to the next slide
[00:58:48.260 --> 00:58:52.100]   and we'll talk about Daniel Kahneman,
[00:58:52.100 --> 00:58:54.100]   huge contributor in behavioral finance.
[00:58:54.100 --> 00:58:59.460]   He won the Nobel in economics for his work,
[00:58:59.460 --> 00:59:03.020]   bridging psychology with behavioral finance.
[00:59:03.020 --> 00:59:08.020]   His contribution, one of the foundations of his work
[00:59:08.780 --> 00:59:12.820]   is framing our thinking through two systems,
[00:59:12.820 --> 00:59:14.340]   system one and system two.
[00:59:14.340 --> 00:59:17.740]   And this is well written about in his book,
[00:59:17.740 --> 00:59:19.980]   "Thinking, Fast and Slow."
[00:59:19.980 --> 00:59:22.340]   So it's thinking fast and slow.
[00:59:22.340 --> 00:59:25.580]   And system ones basically are reflexive,
[00:59:25.580 --> 00:59:27.580]   call it reptilian brain.
[00:59:27.580 --> 00:59:30.940]   And this is evolutionarily very important, right?
[00:59:30.940 --> 00:59:34.540]   On the savannas, we didn't have time to reason
[00:59:34.540 --> 00:59:35.740]   and think and analyze
[00:59:35.740 --> 00:59:37.860]   and reach the most logical decision, right?
[00:59:37.860 --> 00:59:39.980]   You're being chased by a tiger
[00:59:39.980 --> 00:59:44.340]   and you need to, a lot of tribal behavior
[00:59:44.340 --> 00:59:48.020]   ties to evolutionary psychology.
[00:59:48.020 --> 00:59:51.500]   And it makes sense why system one is so powerful.
[00:59:51.500 --> 00:59:54.140]   And system two complements system one.
[00:59:54.140 --> 00:59:59.140]   And that is, it requires more effort, more intense focus,
[00:59:59.140 --> 01:00:01.140]   and it operates methodically.
[01:00:01.140 --> 01:00:05.420]   So his work isn't about squashing one with the other.
[01:00:05.420 --> 01:00:09.500]   It's not like system two is in fact better, they coexist.
[01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:12.940]   We just need to separate and recognize
[01:00:12.940 --> 01:00:15.220]   which one is being active.
[01:00:15.220 --> 01:00:18.260]   And then from that, we can make better decisions.
[01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:21.300]   So if we go to the top two bolded questions,
[01:00:21.300 --> 01:00:23.980]   how often are we in control of our decisions?
[01:00:23.980 --> 01:00:27.220]   We would think most of the time or a lot of the time.
[01:00:27.220 --> 01:00:30.460]   And it's frequently, it depends how you define we,
[01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:33.900]   but there's so much going on unconsciously or around us.
[01:00:33.900 --> 01:00:35.980]   Externally, we can be manipulated.
[01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:41.380]   A lot of marketers take advantage of these biases
[01:00:41.380 --> 01:00:45.980]   and manipulate us and even people informed get manipulated.
[01:00:45.980 --> 01:00:47.100]   So the second question,
[01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:49.860]   how often are we rational when making decisions?
[01:00:49.860 --> 01:00:53.180]   Frequently not, even though we think we are.
[01:00:53.180 --> 01:00:57.300]   So jumping to the last two.
[01:00:57.300 --> 01:00:59.500]   So loss aversion, this is well-studied.
[01:01:00.460 --> 01:01:02.940]   Folks, and it's almost human nature
[01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:07.940]   to be more averse to losing than we are winning.
[01:01:07.940 --> 01:01:11.100]   And sometimes in this example,
[01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:15.980]   losing $100 hurts more than winning $150.
[01:01:15.980 --> 01:01:19.340]   And that's, you could argue irrational or illogical,
[01:01:19.340 --> 01:01:23.500]   but this is how powerful loss is to us.
[01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:26.500]   So that's the bias of loss aversion.
[01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:31.500]   And then anchoring has many examples in personal finance.
[01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:36.140]   And one is, in any negotiation,
[01:01:36.140 --> 01:01:38.940]   an opening price will become the anchor.
[01:01:38.940 --> 01:01:41.620]   And so you can think about it in terms of,
[01:01:41.620 --> 01:01:44.820]   we were speaking on a earlier Bogleheads call,
[01:01:44.820 --> 01:01:48.780]   a parent has an adult child getting married
[01:01:48.780 --> 01:01:51.980]   and they said, here's the price per person.
[01:01:51.980 --> 01:01:56.980]   And if the kid was using anchoring
[01:01:56.980 --> 01:01:58.940]   as a negotiation technique,
[01:01:58.940 --> 01:02:00.700]   they could start with a super high price,
[01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:02.820]   like 300 a person or 500 a person,
[01:02:02.820 --> 01:02:04.540]   whatever it is these days.
[01:02:04.540 --> 01:02:06.500]   And then the parent can react
[01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:08.780]   and then the kid can say the real price
[01:02:08.780 --> 01:02:09.820]   or a much lower price.
[01:02:09.820 --> 01:02:12.620]   Oh, how about 150?
[01:02:12.620 --> 01:02:16.940]   And then the person writing the check feels relieved.
[01:02:16.940 --> 01:02:20.060]   An example of this in the retail marketplace,
[01:02:20.060 --> 01:02:22.860]   let's say someone puts out a high-end designer shoe,
[01:02:22.860 --> 01:02:25.420]   markets it for $500, right?
[01:02:25.420 --> 01:02:28.940]   And no one buys it, but it's marketed for 500.
[01:02:28.940 --> 01:02:32.980]   And then suddenly the retailer marks it down to 200.
[01:02:32.980 --> 01:02:35.340]   All of a sudden people think, wow, it's on sale.
[01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:36.940]   Wow, it's such a discount.
[01:02:36.940 --> 01:02:37.780]   And they buy it.
[01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:41.340]   Even though they may not have bought it at 200 originally,
[01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:44.580]   they suddenly buy it because of anchoring bias.
[01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:46.340]   Another example of this,
[01:02:46.340 --> 01:02:48.780]   you can have a contractor give a quote
[01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:53.380]   and that first quote will affect
[01:02:53.380 --> 01:02:55.580]   how you frame that project or the cost
[01:02:55.580 --> 01:02:57.220]   or how agreeable you are to it.
[01:02:57.220 --> 01:03:01.020]   So hopefully, oh, and a stock purchase price.
[01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:03.180]   I'll close with that example for anchoring.
[01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:06.060]   A lot of people won't sell a stock
[01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:08.340]   until they say it recovers,
[01:03:08.340 --> 01:03:11.140]   but the universe doesn't care about your purchase price
[01:03:11.140 --> 01:03:13.820]   and the stock may never recover.
[01:03:13.820 --> 01:03:16.140]   So we are anchored to this purchase price
[01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:20.260]   because we think we may be entitled to recoup our losses.
[01:03:20.260 --> 01:03:24.060]   And it's just, I wanna say it's just not the case,
[01:03:24.060 --> 01:03:25.940]   but I can't say what you're entitled to or not,
[01:03:25.940 --> 01:03:30.940]   but it's basically an effect of anchoring.
[01:03:30.940 --> 01:03:35.780]   So we should close to leave enough time for Q&A.
[01:03:35.780 --> 01:03:40.780]   I do wanna mention a book called "Scout Mindset"
[01:03:40.780 --> 01:03:42.180]   by Julia Galliff.
[01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:44.540]   She has a TED Talk on YouTube also
[01:03:44.540 --> 01:03:47.580]   where she uses a phrase motivated reasoning.
[01:03:47.580 --> 01:03:51.900]   And that explains evolutionarily why we hinge
[01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:56.900]   to these beliefs that are influenced by desires and fears
[01:03:56.900 --> 01:04:00.660]   and why we let those things
[01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:05.740]   cause us to misinterpret information.
[01:04:05.740 --> 01:04:08.700]   And sometimes it's because we want to win, right?
[01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:11.260]   Winning is more important or in tribal behavior
[01:04:11.260 --> 01:04:16.260]   or our evolutionary ancestors needed to exude confidence.
[01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:22.460]   And so sometimes we're less likely to admit we're wrong.
[01:04:22.460 --> 01:04:27.380]   And so I would say in closing,
[01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:30.260]   just in terms of practical tools,
[01:04:30.260 --> 01:04:34.220]   what can we do to improve on all these biases
[01:04:34.220 --> 01:04:36.740]   and our unconscious tendencies?
[01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:40.660]   And one approach is distancing yourself
[01:04:40.660 --> 01:04:43.580]   from the feeling of shame of being wrong, right?
[01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:46.140]   Like we sometimes make investments
[01:04:46.140 --> 01:04:47.540]   and we're committed to them
[01:04:47.540 --> 01:04:50.180]   and stay the course has a lot of value to it
[01:04:50.180 --> 01:04:52.300]   if the portfolio is well-structured
[01:04:52.300 --> 01:04:54.260]   and the investment choices are good.
[01:04:54.260 --> 01:04:57.780]   But a lot of times we make bad investments
[01:04:57.780 --> 01:05:00.820]   and we cling to them because of the shame of being wrong
[01:05:00.820 --> 01:05:02.860]   or that applies to a lot of things in life.
[01:05:02.860 --> 01:05:06.060]   But if you distance yourself from that and you zoom out
[01:05:06.060 --> 01:05:08.540]   and you kind of apply objectivity,
[01:05:08.540 --> 01:05:11.780]   you can work towards a more rational decision.
[01:05:11.780 --> 01:05:14.060]   And you can take pride in being someone
[01:05:14.060 --> 01:05:15.820]   who is comfortable changing their minds.
[01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:20.020]   A lot of leaders or a lot of people publicly think
[01:05:20.020 --> 01:05:21.580]   it's a weakness to change your mind.
[01:05:21.580 --> 01:05:24.500]   But if you get new information, new material information,
[01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:26.380]   it makes sense to change your mind.
[01:05:26.380 --> 01:05:29.940]   Another tool is seeking out blind spots, right?
[01:05:29.940 --> 01:05:32.020]   I mentioned disconfirming evidence earlier.
[01:05:32.020 --> 01:05:34.220]   Fine, try to figure out what you're missing.
[01:05:35.740 --> 01:05:38.780]   We spoke about portfolio construction.
[01:05:38.780 --> 01:05:42.580]   Once you have a good alignment in terms of your goals,
[01:05:42.580 --> 01:05:44.820]   timeframe, risk tolerance, asset allocation,
[01:05:44.820 --> 01:05:46.020]   diversification, right?
[01:05:46.020 --> 01:05:47.900]   Fundamental for the bogleheads,
[01:05:47.900 --> 01:05:51.740]   you need not check your portfolio constantly.
[01:05:51.740 --> 01:05:56.220]   And that will protect you from these unconscious biases,
[01:05:56.220 --> 01:05:57.060]   right?
[01:05:57.060 --> 01:05:59.780]   We're human, we are subject to fear and greed
[01:05:59.780 --> 01:06:03.220]   and our willpower is often weaker
[01:06:03.220 --> 01:06:06.100]   than our ability to reason and be logical.
[01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:09.220]   So by not checking your portfolio often,
[01:06:09.220 --> 01:06:10.220]   and bogleheads know this.
[01:06:10.220 --> 01:06:13.300]   So I say this in part for our friends and family
[01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:15.900]   and coworkers and the broader community
[01:06:15.900 --> 01:06:18.180]   that comes to bogleheads for guidance.
[01:06:18.180 --> 01:06:23.180]   It's sort of like not trusting your willpower around snacks.
[01:06:23.180 --> 01:06:28.020]   So they say the war with healthy foods
[01:06:28.020 --> 01:06:29.820]   is won or lost at the supermarket.
[01:06:29.820 --> 01:06:32.100]   So you think, oh, I'll get these cookies or chips
[01:06:32.100 --> 01:06:33.540]   and I'll have the willpower to not eat them.
[01:06:33.540 --> 01:06:36.300]   But once they're in the house, your willpower is weak
[01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:39.340]   and you're very likely to eat them.
[01:06:39.340 --> 01:06:40.900]   So how does that apply to a portfolio?
[01:06:40.900 --> 01:06:42.500]   By checking it constantly,
[01:06:42.500 --> 01:06:45.060]   you're subjecting yourself to testing your willpower.
[01:06:45.060 --> 01:06:46.460]   By saying, I don't need to check it,
[01:06:46.460 --> 01:06:47.780]   I'm gonna stay the course,
[01:06:47.780 --> 01:06:52.740]   you're more likely to not make impulsive changes.
[01:06:52.740 --> 01:06:57.740]   With that, we can go to the next slide for closing quotes.
[01:06:59.860 --> 01:07:03.420]   "You have power over your mind, not outside events.
[01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:05.940]   Realize this and you will find strength."
[01:07:05.940 --> 01:07:11.220]   So hopefully folks can tie Marcus's wisdom there
[01:07:11.220 --> 01:07:13.740]   to many things in life.
[01:07:13.740 --> 01:07:16.420]   Jack Bogle in "Enough" spoke about the importance
[01:07:16.420 --> 01:07:19.180]   of character, which is mentioned,
[01:07:19.180 --> 01:07:20.660]   is fundamental to stoicism,
[01:07:20.660 --> 01:07:23.780]   fundamental to how we can define ourselves.
[01:07:23.780 --> 01:07:28.220]   So he says, "In life, we too often allow the illusory
[01:07:28.220 --> 01:07:29.820]   to triumph over the real.
[01:07:29.820 --> 01:07:31.340]   We focus too much on things
[01:07:31.340 --> 01:07:33.380]   and not enough on the intangibles
[01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:35.500]   that make things worthwhile.
[01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:38.580]   Too much on success, a word I never liked,
[01:07:38.580 --> 01:07:40.580]   and not enough on character
[01:07:40.580 --> 01:07:43.340]   without which success is meaningless."
[01:07:43.340 --> 01:07:48.140]   So completely aligned with the philosophy of stoicism.
[01:07:48.140 --> 01:07:49.380]   And the last quote,
[01:07:49.380 --> 01:07:54.580]   this, I believe Miriam found,
[01:07:54.580 --> 01:07:57.940]   and Jack was a participant on the forum
[01:07:57.940 --> 01:08:00.940]   and he posted to the Bogleheads.
[01:08:00.940 --> 01:08:03.180]   And he wrote, "Good morning, my friends.
[01:08:03.180 --> 01:08:05.620]   A lot will happen in the coming 12 months.
[01:08:05.620 --> 01:08:07.500]   It's a perilous world out there.
[01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:10.700]   So get your asset allocation right for you
[01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:12.580]   and then just stay the course.
[01:08:12.580 --> 01:08:14.620]   Best always, Jack."
[01:08:14.620 --> 01:08:18.500]   With that, we'll go to additional resources.
[01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:22.020]   Folks will have this via the PDF,
[01:08:22.020 --> 01:08:25.020]   various books written by people we've spoken about.
[01:08:25.020 --> 01:08:27.220]   Dan Ariely, another leader in the space,
[01:08:27.220 --> 01:08:29.100]   "Predictably Irrational."
[01:08:29.100 --> 01:08:33.100]   Richard Thaler, if folks are interested, co-wrote "Nudge."
[01:08:33.100 --> 01:08:35.180]   There's so much there.
[01:08:35.180 --> 01:08:38.580]   There's just too much.
[01:08:38.580 --> 01:08:43.420]   Opting in and opting out for 401(k) plans is now normal.
[01:08:43.420 --> 01:08:46.060]   And this is something that "Nudge" talks about,
[01:08:46.060 --> 01:08:47.900]   that people have inertia
[01:08:47.900 --> 01:08:51.660]   and they're less likely to enroll in a 401(k) plan
[01:08:51.660 --> 01:08:53.020]   if they see all these choices.
[01:08:53.020 --> 01:08:55.580]   So Congress passed the Pension Protection Act,
[01:08:55.580 --> 01:08:57.620]   I think it was 1996,
[01:08:57.620 --> 01:09:01.500]   and folks can be automatically opted in
[01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:03.820]   to their 401(k) plan as a result.
[01:09:03.820 --> 01:09:06.860]   Another example of that is organ donation.
[01:09:06.860 --> 01:09:09.780]   So I think Dan Ariely writes about this,
[01:09:09.780 --> 01:09:14.780]   that some of the, say, Sweden, Denmark type,
[01:09:14.780 --> 01:09:20.260]   that area of countries have different opt in and opt out
[01:09:20.260 --> 01:09:21.540]   for organ donations.
[01:09:21.540 --> 01:09:26.540]   And so the organ donor participation rate
[01:09:26.540 --> 01:09:28.780]   is so dramatically different
[01:09:28.780 --> 01:09:30.780]   just because of the opt in, opt out,
[01:09:30.780 --> 01:09:33.380]   because people experience inertia.
[01:09:33.380 --> 01:09:36.420]   And if you opt them into organ donation, it's shocking.
[01:09:36.420 --> 01:09:39.020]   Many people will agree to donate their organs.
[01:09:39.020 --> 01:09:42.780]   Okay, "Winner's Curse," another one by Thaler.
[01:09:42.780 --> 01:09:45.900]   And then in terms of stoicism,
[01:09:45.900 --> 01:09:48.700]   we spoke about Marcus as an original source.
[01:09:48.700 --> 01:09:50.580]   Bill Irvine, "A Guide to the Good Life,"
[01:09:50.580 --> 01:09:54.140]   is a great portal, a starting point to stoicism.
[01:09:54.140 --> 01:09:56.060]   Very digestible, very practical.
[01:09:56.060 --> 01:09:58.500]   He's a modern day academic.
[01:09:58.500 --> 01:10:01.140]   He lives and teaches in Ohio.
[01:10:01.140 --> 01:10:04.740]   There are other modern day academics.
[01:10:04.740 --> 01:10:08.500]   Massimo Pellucci, who's listed here,
[01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:10.500]   has very accessible free blogs.
[01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:12.380]   He has free eBooks.
[01:10:12.380 --> 01:10:14.500]   He has dozens of YouTube videos,
[01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:18.180]   incredibly articulate and practical.
[01:10:18.180 --> 01:10:23.180]   So with that, we'll open it up for Q&A.
[01:10:23.180 --> 01:10:25.980]   - Thank you.
[01:10:25.980 --> 01:10:26.820]   Thank you, Gorey.
[01:10:26.820 --> 01:10:28.300]   Thank you, Lucas.
[01:10:28.300 --> 01:10:30.500]   That was very interesting.
[01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:32.340]   I enjoyed it very much.
[01:10:32.340 --> 01:10:35.980]   I'm sure Mr. Vogel would have enjoyed it also.
[01:10:35.980 --> 01:10:38.860]   Thank you for the quotes, Gorey and Mr. Vogel.
[01:10:38.860 --> 01:10:40.860]   - Sure.
[01:10:40.860 --> 01:10:42.860]   - Do we have any questions?
[01:10:42.860 --> 01:10:45.820]   Are there any questions in the chat?
[01:10:45.820 --> 01:10:47.700]   Anybody like to start out with questions,
[01:10:47.700 --> 01:10:48.860]   raising your hand?
[01:10:48.860 --> 01:10:52.660]   We do have one chat question.
[01:10:52.660 --> 01:10:54.060]   - Okay.
[01:10:54.060 --> 01:10:56.220]   - It's from Yuli G.
[01:10:56.220 --> 01:10:58.260]   "Why do we say that action or inaction
[01:10:58.260 --> 01:10:59.460]   "is out of our control?
[01:10:59.460 --> 01:11:02.580]   "I believe that was posted during your Archer example."
[01:11:02.580 --> 01:11:08.420]   - Okay.
[01:11:08.420 --> 01:11:10.820]   I can comment, but Luke, did you wanna take it?
[01:11:10.820 --> 01:11:14.420]   - Yeah, yeah, sure.
[01:11:14.420 --> 01:11:15.940]   So yeah, so the question,
[01:11:15.940 --> 01:11:18.780]   why do we say action or inaction, right?
[01:11:18.780 --> 01:11:20.940]   So kind of, this is,
[01:11:20.940 --> 01:11:23.780]   why is this considered out of our control?
[01:11:23.780 --> 01:11:27.940]   So without getting too philosophical,
[01:11:27.940 --> 01:11:32.060]   the Stoics, they, I mean, they're pretty big
[01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:35.460]   on the part that you control in your mind.
[01:11:35.460 --> 01:11:39.580]   And really, once things,
[01:11:39.580 --> 01:11:42.380]   once like outside of your mind,
[01:11:42.380 --> 01:11:45.460]   you don't necessarily control it, right?
[01:11:45.460 --> 01:11:47.980]   So they actually, the way they describe it
[01:11:47.980 --> 01:11:50.900]   is there's actually something else in between here,
[01:11:50.900 --> 01:11:52.860]   which this is just a model, right?
[01:11:52.860 --> 01:11:54.540]   Some models are useful,
[01:11:54.540 --> 01:11:56.220]   but it's not always 100% accurate.
[01:11:56.220 --> 01:12:00.660]   But there's actually, it would be an impulse,
[01:12:00.660 --> 01:12:03.900]   a mental impulse to action, right?
[01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:06.900]   That you control, which would then lead to that,
[01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:09.780]   that your body, which would take the action.
[01:12:09.780 --> 01:12:13.540]   But you aren't necessarily in control of your body.
[01:12:13.540 --> 01:12:15.140]   Example would be,
[01:12:15.140 --> 01:12:17.860]   let's say you go throw at a baseball, right?
[01:12:17.860 --> 01:12:20.260]   Maybe 99 times out of a hundred,
[01:12:20.260 --> 01:12:22.860]   you know, that your arm's gonna function
[01:12:22.860 --> 01:12:24.980]   exactly as you want it to.
[01:12:24.980 --> 01:12:27.100]   But, you know, maybe that one time,
[01:12:27.100 --> 01:12:28.140]   you know, something happens
[01:12:28.140 --> 01:12:31.420]   and your arm just isn't functioning the way it does, right?
[01:12:31.420 --> 01:12:36.260]   Or, you know, even like a major league pitcher is,
[01:12:36.260 --> 01:12:38.740]   you know, they try to control their action
[01:12:38.740 --> 01:12:40.300]   as best they can, right?
[01:12:40.300 --> 01:12:42.340]   To, you know, make sure that they're
[01:12:42.340 --> 01:12:44.580]   throwing the best pitch possible.
[01:12:44.580 --> 01:12:47.340]   But even then, even the most trained athletes
[01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:50.500]   in the world lose control.
[01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:52.780]   So that's kind of the idea
[01:12:52.780 --> 01:12:55.860]   that you're in control of the impulse to action,
[01:12:55.860 --> 01:12:58.700]   not necessarily the action.
[01:12:58.700 --> 01:13:02.940]   And definitely not in control of the outcome of the action.
[01:13:02.940 --> 01:13:06.060]   That answers that question.
[01:13:06.060 --> 01:13:09.460]   - Lucas, would you say then
[01:13:09.460 --> 01:13:12.500]   that when the archer releases the arrow,
[01:13:12.500 --> 01:13:16.340]   this action or inaction there
[01:13:16.340 --> 01:13:19.220]   would start as soon as the arrow is released
[01:13:19.220 --> 01:13:21.180]   and then the outcome is the target?
[01:13:21.180 --> 01:13:25.140]   - Well, I mean, going off of our example,
[01:13:25.140 --> 01:13:26.540]   it actually would probably,
[01:13:26.540 --> 01:13:30.700]   the part that he controls would probably stop at his mind.
[01:13:30.700 --> 01:13:35.100]   Even though, I mean, it is,
[01:13:35.100 --> 01:13:36.220]   it's kind of a,
[01:13:37.260 --> 01:13:39.900]   and I know philosophers debate about this, right?
[01:13:39.900 --> 01:13:41.700]   Like where exactly do you draw the line
[01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:44.820]   of what you control and what you don't control, right?
[01:13:44.820 --> 01:13:49.820]   And it's, but yeah, that's my understanding.
[01:13:49.820 --> 01:13:52.860]   By the way, I'm absolutely 100%
[01:13:52.860 --> 01:13:55.260]   not a professional philosopher.
[01:13:55.260 --> 01:13:58.260]   This is just to the best of my knowledge.
[01:13:58.260 --> 01:14:00.660]   And I'm sure there's a grad student somewhere
[01:14:00.660 --> 01:14:04.540]   that may watch this video that is rolling their eyes
[01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:05.820]   at some of these responses.
[01:14:05.820 --> 01:14:10.820]   But that's my understanding is the things that we control,
[01:14:10.820 --> 01:14:16.900]   it starts and stops within the mind.
[01:14:16.900 --> 01:14:21.900]   And that's kind of a core tenant of Stoic philosophy.
[01:14:21.900 --> 01:14:29.300]   - Well, if we have any grad students rolling their eyes,
[01:14:29.300 --> 01:14:33.460]   you can raise your hand or speak up.
[01:14:33.460 --> 01:14:34.300]   - Yeah.
[01:14:35.180 --> 01:14:38.500]   - What about when it says do not, on this slide,
[01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:41.300]   I think what the question might have meant was
[01:14:41.300 --> 01:14:44.940]   action or inaction with our portfolio.
[01:14:44.940 --> 01:14:48.340]   In other words, we can do nothing, we can stay the course
[01:14:48.340 --> 01:14:51.900]   when the markets around us are in turmoil,
[01:14:51.900 --> 01:14:55.300]   but that is really an action that we take.
[01:14:55.300 --> 01:14:59.460]   It's not something that is out of our control.
[01:14:59.460 --> 01:15:03.700]   We can, for example, move some of our money
[01:15:03.700 --> 01:15:06.420]   if we're going to retire in the next year or two,
[01:15:06.420 --> 01:15:11.420]   we might wanna preserve some of our 401k that is in stocks,
[01:15:11.420 --> 01:15:15.420]   preserve it in a stable value fund or something,
[01:15:15.420 --> 01:15:19.180]   just to make sure that when we retire in a year or two,
[01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:22.940]   it doesn't tank really bad for us.
[01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:28.940]   That is an action that we take based upon external events,
[01:15:28.940 --> 01:15:30.780]   but it's our reading of them.
[01:15:30.780 --> 01:15:33.420]   And also it's being practical.
[01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:36.860]   And I think Mr. Bogle would agree that changing the course
[01:15:36.860 --> 01:15:39.100]   for practical, personal reasons
[01:15:39.100 --> 01:15:43.260]   based upon your life situation is appropriate,
[01:15:43.260 --> 01:15:49.180]   but not to react to the markets and say,
[01:15:49.180 --> 01:15:51.460]   the market's tanking, therefore I'm gonna sell.
[01:15:51.460 --> 01:15:55.140]   That would not be what he would advocate.
[01:15:55.140 --> 01:15:58.340]   So would you say in that case, you're not really,
[01:15:58.340 --> 01:16:01.860]   maybe that needs to be moved into the-
[01:16:01.860 --> 01:16:04.100]   - Well, so maybe the way to think about it
[01:16:04.100 --> 01:16:06.860]   is like a cause and effect relationship, right?
[01:16:06.860 --> 01:16:11.340]   So your cause is really impacting the effect, right?
[01:16:11.340 --> 01:16:15.180]   So the effect of it would be the action.
[01:16:15.180 --> 01:16:17.020]   And maybe it's kind of,
[01:16:17.020 --> 01:16:19.460]   this is kind of what philosophers end up talking
[01:16:19.460 --> 01:16:22.380]   about definitions of words all the time, right?
[01:16:22.380 --> 01:16:24.380]   So it may end up being exactly,
[01:16:24.380 --> 01:16:27.900]   how are we gonna define action versus the impression
[01:16:27.900 --> 01:16:30.300]   and at what point in between?
[01:16:30.300 --> 01:16:34.020]   But I think the baseline underlying idea, right,
[01:16:34.020 --> 01:16:39.020]   is the causes, the cause that you are,
[01:16:39.020 --> 01:16:43.540]   that have effects in the world outside of us
[01:16:43.540 --> 01:16:46.500]   all come from initially from the mind
[01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:50.060]   and then the impulse to action,
[01:16:50.060 --> 01:16:53.060]   which then the effect of which is action.
[01:16:53.060 --> 01:16:56.220]   I mean, it's kind of a,
[01:16:56.220 --> 01:16:59.100]   I'm trying not to give too philosophical of an answer,
[01:16:59.100 --> 01:17:00.620]   but that's, I don't know,
[01:17:00.620 --> 01:17:02.180]   I don't know if, Gauri, if you have a better answer,
[01:17:02.180 --> 01:17:04.340]   but that's about as best as the one
[01:17:04.340 --> 01:17:05.780]   that I can give right now.
[01:17:05.780 --> 01:17:07.140]   - Yeah, I think that's reasonable.
[01:17:07.140 --> 01:17:10.300]   And I'd reiterate what Miriam said
[01:17:10.300 --> 01:17:12.860]   in terms of how Jack would answer this.
[01:17:12.860 --> 01:17:15.020]   I think that quote that we read of Jack's,
[01:17:15.020 --> 01:17:20.020]   he inserts that to make sure the portfolio is right for you.
[01:17:20.020 --> 01:17:23.580]   If you go to that quote, Lucas,
[01:17:23.580 --> 01:17:27.940]   it was the ending closing quotes.
[01:17:28.580 --> 01:17:31.580]   And I think that's what Miriam was commenting towards.
[01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:33.900]   I think that's what Miriam was commenting towards.
[01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:36.900]   And I think that's what Miriam was commenting towards.
[01:17:36.900 --> 01:17:39.420]   And I think that's what Miriam was commenting towards.
[01:17:39.420 --> 01:17:41.780]   And I think that's what Miriam was commenting towards.
[01:17:41.780 --> 01:17:43.740]   Yeah, this one, so he says,
[01:17:43.740 --> 01:17:48.300]   so get your asset allocation right, pause, for you.
[01:17:48.300 --> 01:17:50.780]   So I think that's what Miriam was commenting towards,
[01:17:50.780 --> 01:17:55.580]   that as long as the allocation is right for you,
[01:17:55.580 --> 01:17:57.740]   and for you means at this particular phase of life,
[01:17:57.740 --> 01:17:59.140]   you want to be more conservative.
[01:17:59.140 --> 01:18:00.780]   But if you have other income sources
[01:18:00.780 --> 01:18:03.100]   and you're not relying on your portfolio,
[01:18:03.100 --> 01:18:06.140]   maybe you don't necessarily want it to be more conservative.
[01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:08.660]   So there's no single answer here.
[01:18:08.660 --> 01:18:12.380]   So it's for you, it's very, that specific piece,
[01:18:12.380 --> 01:18:14.180]   and then stay the course.
[01:18:14.180 --> 01:18:18.660]   But to Miriam's point, if it's not appropriate for you,
[01:18:18.660 --> 01:18:20.500]   let's say your circumstances change.
[01:18:20.500 --> 01:18:22.100]   Let's say there's a medical event
[01:18:22.100 --> 01:18:24.140]   or a family friend in need,
[01:18:24.140 --> 01:18:26.900]   or it could be any of dozens of things
[01:18:26.900 --> 01:18:29.500]   for you is a material change,
[01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:31.620]   then it would warrant the change.
[01:18:31.620 --> 01:18:33.060]   That's how I read it.
[01:18:33.060 --> 01:18:38.860]   Any other questions in the chat or live questions?
[01:18:38.860 --> 01:18:40.740]   Anyone want to raise their hand?
[01:18:40.740 --> 01:18:44.940]   Since we have about six minutes in the allocated time.
[01:18:44.940 --> 01:18:50.820]   In the absence of questions, I, and if it's okay, yep.
[01:18:50.820 --> 01:18:55.820]   - We have one, someone said, is asking,
[01:18:56.540 --> 01:18:59.460]   is there truly a reliable, stable fund?
[01:18:59.460 --> 01:19:00.620]   And then of course I fire it back
[01:19:00.620 --> 01:19:02.060]   with the link to the Wiki article,
[01:19:02.060 --> 01:19:05.020]   but was there anything more involved
[01:19:05.020 --> 01:19:08.420]   with the word stable value in terms of finance?
[01:19:08.420 --> 01:19:11.860]   Actually, a stable value fund is our insurance contracts,
[01:19:11.860 --> 01:19:14.980]   but maybe there was something implied there.
[01:19:14.980 --> 01:19:17.620]   - I was the one that used that example.
[01:19:17.620 --> 01:19:21.060]   In my 401k, there was a stable value fund
[01:19:21.060 --> 01:19:24.900]   and a stable value fund is like Lady Geek says,
[01:19:24.900 --> 01:19:26.780]   it's offered by insurance companies,
[01:19:26.780 --> 01:19:31.780]   but it's in part of a 401k or a 547B plan.
[01:19:31.780 --> 01:19:38.100]   My understanding is they're not offered
[01:19:38.100 --> 01:19:41.620]   outside of workplace employer plans.
[01:19:41.620 --> 01:19:44.060]   And what it is, it's kind of like a money market.
[01:19:44.060 --> 01:19:45.100]   No, it's not a money market.
[01:19:45.100 --> 01:19:47.140]   It's not a short-term paper fund.
[01:19:47.140 --> 01:19:50.340]   It is more like a CD, shall we?
[01:19:50.340 --> 01:19:55.340]   My stable value fund was actually offered by Voya
[01:19:55.340 --> 01:19:58.140]   through T. Rowe Price.
[01:19:58.140 --> 01:20:02.220]   And they would guarantee a certain percent.
[01:20:02.220 --> 01:20:04.980]   You would earn a certain percent and it was a lot.
[01:20:04.980 --> 01:20:09.340]   It was like 4% for a year or a year and a half.
[01:20:09.340 --> 01:20:10.500]   At that point, it would be,
[01:20:10.500 --> 01:20:12.140]   they would tell you when it was up
[01:20:12.140 --> 01:20:14.500]   and then they would renegotiate.
[01:20:14.500 --> 01:20:16.980]   And you could guarantee for that period of time,
[01:20:16.980 --> 01:20:18.500]   that's what it was.
[01:20:18.500 --> 01:20:22.460]   So in that sense, the stable value fund was stable,
[01:20:22.460 --> 01:20:25.020]   but it was within the workplace.
[01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:27.860]   It's not with outside in a 401k or something.
[01:20:27.860 --> 01:20:30.780]   You can't buy them on the open market is my understanding.
[01:20:30.780 --> 01:20:35.420]   And Jim, do you have a question?
[01:20:35.420 --> 01:20:42.140]   - They have an area in their life that maybe they got.
[01:20:42.140 --> 01:20:44.180]   - We can't hear you, we can't understand you.
[01:20:46.180 --> 01:20:47.020]   - Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:20:47.020 --> 01:20:49.420]   I'm on a weird remote connection.
[01:20:49.420 --> 01:20:51.980]   So I'm gonna just sit down, sorry.
[01:20:51.980 --> 01:20:56.060]   Can you hear me now?
[01:20:56.060 --> 01:20:57.260]   - Yeah, yep, yeah.
[01:20:57.260 --> 01:20:59.540]   - Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:20:59.540 --> 01:21:01.420]   Okay, so my question to both presenters is,
[01:21:01.420 --> 01:21:02.980]   is there an area in your life
[01:21:02.980 --> 01:21:06.500]   that which you use stoicism to get control of
[01:21:06.500 --> 01:21:11.460]   or to get it on the stoicism line?
[01:21:11.460 --> 01:21:13.700]   And then what things do you feel
[01:21:13.700 --> 01:21:16.980]   that you might be slipping away from that?
[01:21:16.980 --> 01:21:20.740]   Whether the trigger items or what gives you that sense
[01:21:20.740 --> 01:21:24.500]   that you're falling off the wagon for stoicism?
[01:21:24.500 --> 01:21:30.140]   - Lucas, do you wanna start?
[01:21:30.140 --> 01:21:32.820]   - Yeah, so I mean, there's two questions there.
[01:21:32.820 --> 01:21:36.180]   The first was kind of, I guess,
[01:21:36.180 --> 01:21:39.780]   I think it was kind of how did you kind of get into it?
[01:21:39.780 --> 01:21:42.900]   Was that, that was kind of the first question, right?
[01:21:42.900 --> 01:21:45.220]   - Or something that you really thought
[01:21:45.220 --> 01:21:49.380]   you had a control over by using stoicism.
[01:21:49.380 --> 01:21:52.740]   But now you felt at times you slip away
[01:21:52.740 --> 01:21:54.980]   and what's telling you that?
[01:21:54.980 --> 01:22:02.620]   - Well, when I kind of first started paying more attention
[01:22:02.620 --> 01:22:05.180]   to my personal finances,
[01:22:05.180 --> 01:22:11.020]   I'm gonna back up.
[01:22:11.340 --> 01:22:12.900]   One idea within stoicism,
[01:22:12.900 --> 01:22:15.500]   you don't control other people, right?
[01:22:15.500 --> 01:22:16.780]   You can offer suggestions,
[01:22:16.780 --> 01:22:18.940]   but you don't control other people.
[01:22:18.940 --> 01:22:22.700]   When I first started focusing a little bit more
[01:22:22.700 --> 01:22:24.020]   on personal finance,
[01:22:24.020 --> 01:22:28.660]   I had to learn that I do not control my spouse's spending.
[01:22:28.660 --> 01:22:32.780]   And that was something that, right?
[01:22:32.780 --> 01:22:38.140]   In terms of budgeting and that sort of thing, right?
[01:22:38.140 --> 01:22:41.500]   That you don't completely control the other person, right?
[01:22:41.500 --> 01:22:45.900]   And so that was something that it was,
[01:22:45.900 --> 01:22:49.620]   a bit of a learning from my end.
[01:22:49.620 --> 01:22:57.020]   - Cool, I'll answer kind of more broadly.
[01:22:57.020 --> 01:23:01.620]   I think it's so practical daily,
[01:23:01.620 --> 01:23:04.580]   like you can meet most any challenge with it.
[01:23:04.580 --> 01:23:08.620]   Like, let's say I drop something
[01:23:08.620 --> 01:23:11.020]   and it spills all over the floor.
[01:23:11.020 --> 01:23:14.580]   I think, man, it's very upsetting.
[01:23:14.580 --> 01:23:17.340]   And then I just, before reacting,
[01:23:17.340 --> 01:23:22.300]   like before losing one's temper or whatever,
[01:23:22.300 --> 01:23:23.860]   I'll just like zoom out and say,
[01:23:23.860 --> 01:23:25.420]   all right, it's actually no big deal.
[01:23:25.420 --> 01:23:27.260]   I could clean that up pretty easily.
[01:23:27.260 --> 01:23:28.100]   And then you do.
[01:23:28.100 --> 01:23:30.100]   And that might be a really simple example,
[01:23:30.100 --> 01:23:35.100]   but you could expand on that to almost many unwanted things
[01:23:35.100 --> 01:23:40.580]   in life and just zoom out and reframe
[01:23:40.580 --> 01:23:42.900]   and then realize this has a solution.
[01:23:42.900 --> 01:23:46.580]   This has a practical approach and I can take action for it.
[01:23:46.580 --> 01:23:49.020]   And then it's like instantly empowering.
[01:23:49.020 --> 01:23:52.060]   I'll respond to what the other thing you asked
[01:23:52.060 --> 01:23:57.060]   about veering from it to the credit of Stoic philosophers.
[01:23:58.580 --> 01:24:03.500]   Seneca referred to himself as a patient in the hospital
[01:24:03.500 --> 01:24:04.700]   amongst other patients.
[01:24:04.700 --> 01:24:06.380]   So he was writing to his friend
[01:24:06.380 --> 01:24:08.860]   and he wasn't claiming to have
[01:24:08.860 --> 01:24:10.900]   like some superior enlightenment.
[01:24:10.900 --> 01:24:13.660]   He was just saying, these are things that work,
[01:24:13.660 --> 01:24:15.660]   that helped me, that may help you.
[01:24:15.660 --> 01:24:20.660]   And so Stoicism was big on pulling the best ideas
[01:24:20.660 --> 01:24:22.980]   wherever they existed.
[01:24:22.980 --> 01:24:27.980]   It was not confined to these certain beliefs
[01:24:28.500 --> 01:24:31.860]   and in fact, I think Seneca said,
[01:24:31.860 --> 01:24:36.860]   he doesn't mind being a spy in the enemy's camp
[01:24:36.860 --> 01:24:39.940]   as long as they're doing something better
[01:24:39.940 --> 01:24:44.180]   that he can learn from, he's happy to take that knowledge.
[01:24:44.180 --> 01:24:46.660]   And so when you said veering from it,
[01:24:46.660 --> 01:24:50.820]   there are many instances where you really have to reach,
[01:24:50.820 --> 01:24:55.020]   like it's not immediate, but if you find something better
[01:24:55.020 --> 01:24:56.220]   and Marcus says this too,
[01:24:56.220 --> 01:25:00.260]   if you find something better than courage, justice,
[01:25:00.260 --> 01:25:02.860]   temperance, and wisdom, then go for it.
[01:25:02.860 --> 01:25:06.220]   But in his lifetime and his practicing
[01:25:06.220 --> 01:25:09.020]   of running the empire for 20 years,
[01:25:09.020 --> 01:25:10.740]   he did not find anything better
[01:25:10.740 --> 01:25:13.020]   than the combination of those four.
[01:25:13.020 --> 01:25:14.940]   So I see we're at 9.30.
[01:25:14.940 --> 01:25:21.460]   If folks wanna stay on, I think in a minute or two,
[01:25:21.460 --> 01:25:23.180]   I could highlight some takeaways
[01:25:23.180 --> 01:25:26.900]   from this Scout Mindset book 'cause it's so relevant.
[01:25:26.900 --> 01:25:29.500]   We didn't include it as an additional resource
[01:25:29.500 --> 01:25:32.140]   'cause it's not behavioral finance, but.
[01:25:32.140 --> 01:25:34.740]   - I have another behavior finance question.
[01:25:34.740 --> 01:25:36.340]   - Oh, sure.
[01:25:36.340 --> 01:25:41.340]   - And it has to do with the losing of $100.
[01:25:41.340 --> 01:25:48.500]   We hate more than making $150.
[01:25:48.500 --> 01:25:51.820]   I've read that before and that relates
[01:25:51.820 --> 01:25:56.820]   to the stoic view of what, I can't remember what.
[01:25:56.820 --> 01:26:00.980]   And actually it occurred to me when you posted that slide,
[01:26:00.980 --> 01:26:03.700]   there might be an evolutionary reason for it.
[01:26:03.700 --> 01:26:08.700]   In other words, when you had the savanna,
[01:26:08.700 --> 01:26:11.740]   running from the tiger in the savanna,
[01:26:11.740 --> 01:26:16.740]   that if you, sometimes losing something has greater risk.
[01:26:19.260 --> 01:26:21.860]   You're more at risk when you lose something
[01:26:21.860 --> 01:26:23.620]   than making something.
[01:26:23.620 --> 01:26:26.180]   That as long as you make something, you're okay.
[01:26:26.180 --> 01:26:29.340]   But losing something, you can lose your life.
[01:26:29.340 --> 01:26:31.500]   - Sure, and there's also a sentimentality.
[01:26:31.500 --> 01:26:33.980]   There's an emotional attachment to things.
[01:26:33.980 --> 01:26:37.060]   They've done this experiment with what people will pay
[01:26:37.060 --> 01:26:39.660]   for concert tickets or show tickets.
[01:26:39.660 --> 01:26:43.780]   And once they own that ticket, they experiment by saying,
[01:26:43.780 --> 01:26:46.740]   if we offered you X percent more
[01:26:46.740 --> 01:26:49.180]   or X dollars more than what you paid,
[01:26:49.180 --> 01:26:52.140]   people will hold onto that ticket,
[01:26:52.140 --> 01:26:55.180]   even though they were only willing to pay
[01:26:55.180 --> 01:26:56.660]   up to a certain amount for it.
[01:26:56.660 --> 01:27:00.140]   Logically, you think they would sell it for a higher price,
[01:27:00.140 --> 01:27:03.980]   but not necessarily 'cause there's an emotional bias.
[01:27:03.980 --> 01:27:07.540]   And I think that was included more so for behavioral finance
[01:27:07.540 --> 01:27:10.460]   and less so than a stoic concept,
[01:27:10.460 --> 01:27:14.380]   but included there as an overlap into behavioral finance.
[01:27:14.380 --> 01:27:19.380]   - And I see that, Jim, you have your hand up.
[01:27:19.380 --> 01:27:22.420]   Did you have another question?
[01:27:22.420 --> 01:27:30.780]   - Jim, did you wanna, did you want to lower your hand?
[01:27:30.780 --> 01:27:32.860]   - You're on mute, we're just talking.
[01:27:32.860 --> 01:27:35.140]   - Nope, okay, lowered his hand.
[01:27:35.140 --> 01:27:39.460]   - Okay, so I don't know if folks are staying on,
[01:27:39.460 --> 01:27:42.900]   but I think there's so much value in that.
[01:27:42.900 --> 01:27:47.900]   I think there's so much value in this scout mindset
[01:27:47.900 --> 01:27:51.260]   that I'll just quickly cover some of her points
[01:27:51.260 --> 01:27:54.980]   because part of the theme of this presentation
[01:27:54.980 --> 01:27:57.180]   is that we are often not rational,
[01:27:57.180 --> 01:28:00.580]   but it's within our power to find tools
[01:28:00.580 --> 01:28:03.140]   and use those tools and strengthen our ability
[01:28:03.140 --> 01:28:05.460]   to be rational, logical,
[01:28:05.460 --> 01:28:08.540]   and less influenced by unconscious biases.
[01:28:08.540 --> 01:28:11.380]   So she says, how do we get there?
[01:28:11.380 --> 01:28:15.220]   And her paradigm is scout versus soldier.
[01:28:15.220 --> 01:28:17.620]   Soldiers are performing a certain function.
[01:28:17.620 --> 01:28:21.100]   Scouts go out and try to get the lay of the land
[01:28:21.100 --> 01:28:23.780]   aligned with reality, an objective reality.
[01:28:23.780 --> 01:28:27.380]   That's part of how she defines a scout's purpose.
[01:28:27.380 --> 01:28:30.740]   And she says, what traits are in people
[01:28:30.740 --> 01:28:34.180]   who are more likely to be good scouts?
[01:28:34.180 --> 01:28:35.620]   So what traits are more likely?
[01:28:35.620 --> 01:28:39.020]   And she found curiosity is a commonality.
[01:28:39.020 --> 01:28:42.260]   Feeling pleasure from learning new information.
[01:28:42.260 --> 01:28:45.900]   So that can help you identify objective reality.
[01:28:45.900 --> 01:28:47.500]   Itching to solve a puzzle
[01:28:47.500 --> 01:28:50.060]   versus just accepting things how they are.
[01:28:50.060 --> 01:28:54.380]   Being intrigued when you encounter something
[01:28:54.380 --> 01:28:56.860]   that contradicts your expectations
[01:28:56.860 --> 01:28:59.660]   or your assumptions or your conclusions.
[01:28:59.660 --> 01:29:01.180]   And all of these things might sound,
[01:29:01.180 --> 01:29:04.180]   oh, intuitive or easy or yeah, who wouldn't do that?
[01:29:04.180 --> 01:29:07.700]   But realistically, day-to-day and year-to-year
[01:29:07.700 --> 01:29:09.340]   and entire lifetimes,
[01:29:09.340 --> 01:29:12.500]   we are often ingrained in our ways and our habits
[01:29:12.500 --> 01:29:16.460]   that we don't realize we're not being logical,
[01:29:16.460 --> 01:29:18.380]   rational, practical, as we've said.
[01:29:18.380 --> 01:29:23.380]   So she said, they feel virtuous testing their own beliefs.
[01:29:23.380 --> 01:29:25.500]   And this was fundamental to Stoics.
[01:29:25.500 --> 01:29:29.500]   When I say Marcus said, if you find anything better
[01:29:29.500 --> 01:29:31.860]   than courage, justice, temperance, and wisdom,
[01:29:31.860 --> 01:29:36.460]   he adamantly meant test your assumptions,
[01:29:36.460 --> 01:29:38.660]   test your conclusions.
[01:29:38.660 --> 01:29:42.300]   And if your assumptions were wrong,
[01:29:42.300 --> 01:29:45.860]   your hypothesis had holes in it, strengthen it.
[01:29:45.860 --> 01:29:50.660]   So not being married to early conclusions.
[01:29:50.660 --> 01:29:57.460]   We spoke about being less likely to consider someone weak
[01:29:57.460 --> 01:30:00.180]   if they change their mind.
[01:30:00.180 --> 01:30:02.580]   Like in politics, we saw this phrase waffling
[01:30:02.580 --> 01:30:04.780]   and it was framed negatively.
[01:30:06.060 --> 01:30:09.260]   But as you find new information,
[01:30:09.260 --> 01:30:14.100]   it's actually a strength to sometimes evolve
[01:30:14.100 --> 01:30:15.820]   with that new information.
[01:30:15.820 --> 01:30:18.380]   So those were some traits
[01:30:18.380 --> 01:30:22.380]   for what she found to be a scout mindset.
[01:30:22.380 --> 01:30:27.780]   - Thanks for sharing, Gary.
[01:30:27.780 --> 01:30:29.020]   - Thank you, thank you.
[01:30:29.020 --> 01:30:32.500]   Do we have any other questions?
[01:30:32.500 --> 01:30:33.340]   - No.
[01:30:33.340 --> 01:30:40.780]   - Nothing in the chat.
[01:30:40.780 --> 01:30:43.500]   One thing, Liguri.
[01:30:43.500 --> 01:30:44.340]   - Yep.
[01:30:44.340 --> 01:30:49.980]   - The Finance Buff, also known as, his name is Harry Sitt.
[01:30:49.980 --> 01:30:51.860]   He often gets, he's a Boglehead
[01:30:51.860 --> 01:30:53.700]   who writes on the Boglehead Forum.
[01:30:53.700 --> 01:30:57.820]   He has his own blog, thefinancebuff.com.
[01:30:57.820 --> 01:31:00.660]   No, dot, yeah, dot com, I think.
[01:31:00.660 --> 01:31:03.580]   He had a wonderful article years ago
[01:31:03.580 --> 01:31:08.580]   and he called it "Safety in the Mainstream."
[01:31:08.580 --> 01:31:12.580]   And basically, it relates to the stoic values
[01:31:12.580 --> 01:31:15.780]   that you were talking about,
[01:31:15.780 --> 01:31:19.620]   or the value of that you do the best you can
[01:31:19.620 --> 01:31:21.660]   with what you can control.
[01:31:21.660 --> 01:31:23.740]   And what you cannot control,
[01:31:23.740 --> 01:31:27.620]   you don't lose your sleep over, you don't stress over it.
[01:31:27.620 --> 01:31:29.500]   You do the best you can.
[01:31:29.500 --> 01:31:33.700]   And he related that to index funds,
[01:31:33.700 --> 01:31:35.620]   investing in index funds.
[01:31:35.620 --> 01:31:39.540]   So that is why he invests in index funds.
[01:31:39.540 --> 01:31:43.460]   He said, "Because I do the best I can,
[01:31:43.460 --> 01:31:46.420]   "I create my portfolio with index funds,
[01:31:46.420 --> 01:31:51.420]   "knowing that at least I will receive market returns.
[01:31:51.420 --> 01:31:54.900]   "That if the market tanks, if the market goes down,
[01:31:54.900 --> 01:31:59.300]   "if there's a recession, if there is just a bear market,
[01:31:59.300 --> 01:32:01.980]   "my index funds are going to go down,
[01:32:01.980 --> 01:32:04.020]   "my stock funds are gonna go down.
[01:32:04.020 --> 01:32:06.900]   "But I did not cause that.
[01:32:06.900 --> 01:32:09.180]   "The market caused that.
[01:32:09.180 --> 01:32:12.260]   "I invested in index funds
[01:32:12.260 --> 01:32:15.060]   "and I know that they will go up and down,
[01:32:15.060 --> 01:32:16.420]   "but I don't have to worry.
[01:32:16.420 --> 01:32:21.180]   "I am safe from my own emotions of kicking myself
[01:32:21.180 --> 01:32:24.100]   "that I invested in a stupid stock.
[01:32:24.100 --> 01:32:26.500]   "I did not invest in a stupid stock.
[01:32:26.500 --> 01:32:30.060]   "I put my money in the index fund
[01:32:30.060 --> 01:32:33.660]   "that invests in 3000 stocks
[01:32:33.660 --> 01:32:37.220]   "and it is doing what I expected it to do.
[01:32:37.220 --> 01:32:39.420]   "It is following the market.
[01:32:39.420 --> 01:32:44.420]   "And so I'm happy, I'm safe.
[01:32:44.420 --> 01:32:47.860]   "I was safe in what I did in my own mind."
[01:32:47.860 --> 01:32:52.020]   - Yeah, excellent example, super practical.
[01:32:52.020 --> 01:32:57.020]   And again, sometimes it takes convincing ourselves
[01:32:57.020 --> 01:32:58.700]   like it's an exercise, right?
[01:32:58.700 --> 01:33:00.140]   If your portfolio goes down,
[01:33:00.140 --> 01:33:05.140]   it's really hard to feel isolated from that experience,
[01:33:05.140 --> 01:33:10.860]   but you can do exactly what Miriam just said.
[01:33:10.860 --> 01:33:15.300]   Think about the decision you made, how you made it,
[01:33:15.300 --> 01:33:17.500]   that you made the best decision at the time
[01:33:17.500 --> 01:33:19.380]   with what was available to you.
[01:33:19.380 --> 01:33:21.140]   And you can find consolation in that.
[01:33:21.140 --> 01:33:23.700]   You can find comfort and peace of mind.
[01:33:23.700 --> 01:33:27.460]   The thing is, I think so many Bogleheads know this,
[01:33:27.460 --> 01:33:29.020]   that it's interesting,
[01:33:29.020 --> 01:33:35.260]   folks who might benefit the most from this message
[01:33:35.260 --> 01:33:39.180]   are not hearing it as easily
[01:33:39.180 --> 01:33:42.620]   'cause there's so much noise in the world and the media
[01:33:42.620 --> 01:33:45.860]   that this practical approach gets drowned out.
[01:33:45.860 --> 01:33:51.020]   But yeah, I'll reiterate another thing
[01:33:51.020 --> 01:33:53.660]   that overlaps that a lot of these things
[01:33:53.660 --> 01:33:56.540]   are so much easier to say,
[01:33:56.540 --> 01:33:59.220]   but they are in fact within our reach.
[01:33:59.220 --> 01:34:02.300]   They are able to be practiced
[01:34:02.300 --> 01:34:04.740]   and they do strengthen with time.
[01:34:04.740 --> 01:34:08.940]   So understanding that there are more natural intuitive.
