[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.080]   what's the link between vision and motivation and how can we leverage that in order to better
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.080]   reach our goals?
[00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.080]   Totally.
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.460]   So, you know, we started thinking about what are the goals that are most important to people
[00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.640]   that they struggle with the most.
[00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.000]   So we asked hundreds, thousands of people what their new year's resolutions are.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.560]   We looked to all the other polls that do the same kind of work.
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.140]   And regardless of where you look or who you ask or when you ask it, people's number one
[00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.120]   goal is something related to their health, right?
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:35.280]   To lose weight, to exercise more, to get out, get more steps for mental well-being, physical
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.200]   well-being.
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.320]   And that's like the number one goal every January 1st.
[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.280]   So if we were able to accomplish that goal, you'd think it would drop a little bit in
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.280]   the rankings.
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.280]   But it doesn't because it's really hard.
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.140]   So we thought, I wonder if there's a way for us to make some progress on that, on helping
[00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.620]   people to exercise better, more often, stick to it longer, and make some progress there.
[00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.180]   We know diets don't work.
[00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.180]   And why don't diets work?
[00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.420]   For the same reason that that self-talk doesn't work, is that, you know, we go in it full
[00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:11.080]   bore, hardcore, and it requires a major commitment and effort to a lifestyle change.
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.780]   So again, we were looking for something that might be easier than that, that could produce
[00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.220]   big, big payoff, right?
[00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.220]   That's the golden ticket.
[00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.940]   It's something that requires less effort for a bigger payoff.
[00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:27.340]   So one of the first things that I did was go over to Brooklyn to this old armory building.
[00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.860]   It used to be a military armory space.
[00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:30.860]   Yeah.
[00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:31.860]   I think I know that building.
[00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:32.860]   Yeah.
[00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.500]   It's a beautiful building now that houses a lot of businesses, right?
[00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.500]   With plants on the walls?
[00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.500]   Yeah, there's businesses.
[00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.260]   There's a couple of armories all around the boroughs here, around New York City.
[00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.820]   And the one in Brooklyn in particular is now YMCA, right?
[00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.700]   So it's a family YMCA that's within a beautiful old red brick building that used to be a military
[00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.380]   establishment long, long ago.
[00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.660]   And what's really cool is that one winter afternoon, somebody had invited me, a physical
[00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.460]   therapist said, "Hey, you should come out and check out what's happening here with your
[00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.700]   interest in exercise and trying to find new ways of helping people, new tactics that they
[00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.460]   can add to their tool belt.
[00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.060]   I think you're going to find some interesting people that are working out there."
[00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.060]   So I showed up.
[00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.060]   I look around.
[00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.060]   There's families.
[00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.060]   There's new moms.
[00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.860]   There's kids that are – moms trying to get kids to burn off some winter energy that
[00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:19.860]   they have.
[00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.940]   There's people that look like they're just there for their – every couple of days going
[00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:23.940]   out for a run.
[00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.060]   There's some people that look like they're training with a team.
[00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.420]   And that's who this physical therapist introduced me to, was the coach of this team.
[00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.780]   There's a bunch of people that were sitting down on the ground, and I would be hard-pressed
[00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.580]   to know who's the high school student that's in this group and then who, as it turns out,
[00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.820]   are some of the fastest runners in the world.
[00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.900]   One of the people that was in the last Olympics before I showed up won the gold medal for
[00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.500]   the 400-meter, and from the looks of them – I mean, of course, their bodies are in
[00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.260]   better shape than mine, but there's nothing so – of course, they're not wearing their
[00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.260]   medals.
[00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.220]   There's nothing pretentious about how they're walking around or anything like that that
[00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.300]   would lead me to know, like, "This person's amazing," and they probably have some insight
[00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.940]   that I don't have.
[00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.300]   So once I got introduced to them and knew who are these people that were part of this
[00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:15.320]   pretty elite training team that happened to work out at this family gym, I had the chance
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.720]   to talk with them about, "What strategies do you use?"
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.860]   Now, I am not an elite runner, and having recently had a baby, I'm not really a runner
[00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.660]   right now at all, but I thought when these people are running, I bet they are, like,
[00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.660]   hyper-aware of everything that's going on in their surroundings.
[00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.940]   Where are they relative to the competition, what's happening in their peripheral vision,
[00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.980]   what's going on on the side, who's behind them, who's in front of them.
[00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.900]   They probably have this, like, master sense, this master visual plan at any point in time,
[00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.380]   and that's what probably makes them elite.
[00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.500]   So when I started asking them, "Is that the case?
[00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.500]   Do you really pay attention to what's in your surroundings, what's behind you, what's on
[00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:52.500]   the side?"
[00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.500]   They said, "No."
[00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.980]   Like, all of them said, "No."
[00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.020]   And sometimes when I do do that, it's a mistake.
[00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.320]   It doesn't work for me.
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.320]   So that was surprising.
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.740]   It totally went against my intuition about what they do that likely contributes to their
[00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:04.740]   success.
[00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.940]   What they said instead was that they are hyper-focused.
[00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:13.660]   They assume this narrowed focus of attention, almost like a spotlight is shining on a target.
[00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.900]   Now, when they're running a short distance, that target might literally be the finish
[00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.300]   line, the line that they're trying to cross.
[00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:22.780]   If it's a longer distance, they set sub-goals, like, you know, the person, the shorts on
[00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.660]   the person up ahead that they're trying to beat.
[00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:30.500]   Or they choose some sort of stable landmark, like a sign that they would pass by.
[00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.840]   And like a spotlight is shining just on that, or, like, they have blinders on the sides
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:34.840]   of their face.
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.300]   That's all they're paying attention to.
[00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.580]   It's a really narrowed scope of attention.
[00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.180]   And that was a strategy that all of these elite athletes said that they used.
[00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:49.520]   And those that were better rather than slower were ones that used it more.
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.420]   And I thought, "Oh, that's something we can play with."
[00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:52.420]   Right?
[00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:56.500]   Like, they are elite and they are accomplished, but that visual strategy isn't necessarily
[00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.400]   something that you have to be in the perfect physical condition to be able to adopt.
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.740]   And so I wonder, can that help the rest of us who aren't competing for an Olympic gold
[00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.380]   and who have no chance of ever getting one, but who want to exercise better, have a better
[00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:13.620]   time doing it, and maintain a commitment to that exercise goal that they might have that
[00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.740]   they might otherwise, you know, by February or March be giving up on if they had set it
[00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.880]   at the beginning of January?
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.980]   So that's really where the work started was, you know, what you might call, like, focus
[00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:29.580]   groups or case studies of these incredible athletes.
[00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.780]   And then we did other studies looking at, you know, people who aren't Olympic athletes
[00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:37.740]   but who are competitive New York road runners.
[00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.260]   And how are they running in races?
[00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:43.540]   And what we found is that those people who have better pace, faster pace, better time,
[00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:48.600]   they use that narrowed strategy more often than this more expansive or, you know, open
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.660]   scope of attention.
[00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.620]   And there seemed to be a correlation between that.
[00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:58.320]   Better performance among a wider swath of hundreds of runners who are doing it competitively
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.140]   but still, you know, could be like the person that you're sitting next to in the office
[00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.300]   or yourself, right?
[00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:09.620]   And the more often that they did it, and the more consistently they had adopted that, that
[00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.340]   technique of the narrowed focus of attention, it seemed that they were doing better in their
[00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.280]   runs.
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:20.380]   So then we started thinking, like, okay, what about people who aren't competitive runners?
[00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.700]   What about, like, my mom?
[00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:23.700]   Can she do that?
[00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:27.380]   Or me when I'm trying to get back on the bandwagon and exercise more?
[00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.300]   Is this a tactic we can teach people?
[00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:30.840]   The answer is yes.
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.660]   You can tell people about what these Olympic athletes are doing.
[00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:37.860]   You can tell them about what the New York road runners are doing.
[00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.420]   And just using the same language that I just used with you, right?
[00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:43.300]   Imagine that there's a spotlight shining just on a target.
[00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:48.660]   Choose something up ahead, the stop sign two blocks up that you can just see.
[00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:52.260]   And you know, imagine that you have blinders on so that you're not really paying attention
[00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:56.220]   to the people that are passing by or the buildings or the garbage cans or the trucks that are
[00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:57.580]   on the road.
[00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:01.780]   You know, tune those out and focus in on that target until you hit it.
[00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:02.780]   And then choose another one.
[00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:03.780]   Right?
[00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:04.780]   Sort of recalibrate.
[00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:05.780]   Choose the next goal.
[00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:08.020]   And so we would test, like, can people do that?
[00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:12.100]   I mean, if you're listening right now, you probably are imagining that experience, too.
[00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:13.100]   And the answer is yes.
[00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:14.100]   Like, I can imagine that.
[00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:15.100]   I know what those words mean.
[00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:16.340]   And I can do that.
[00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:18.400]   And our work found that, too, that people can do that.
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.860]   We have them say out loud, what is it that's captured your attention?
[00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:25.180]   And of course, sometimes something in the periphery, like movement, captures our gaze
[00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:30.220]   and we're pulled there for an instant, but then we can refocus up again and adopt that
[00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:31.220]   narrowed attention.
[00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:36.880]   Now, one of the first studies that we did was teach that strategy and juxtapose or compare
[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:40.420]   it against a group that we said, just look around naturally.
[00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:44.120]   You know, you might see that finish line up ahead and there's things on the periphery.
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.820]   Whatever your eyes want to do, whatever you think is going to work best, feel free to
[00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:48.620]   do that and tell us what you're looking at.
[00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:50.220]   Then we gave them a finish line.
[00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:55.260]   We created sort of, you know, an exercise that's moderately challenging but possible.
[00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:59.300]   We put ankle weights on that accounted for about 15% of their body weight, told them
[00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:02.740]   to lift their knees up, sort of high stepping to a finish line.
[00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:07.900]   So this would be challenging for them to do, but we said, you know, it's an indicator of
[00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:10.740]   overall health and fitness.
[00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:14.060]   Some of these people had narrowed their focus of attention and some were just looking more
[00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:16.900]   expansively or naturally.
[00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:20.620]   And what we found is that those people that we trained, just everyday normal people doing
[00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:25.760]   this moderately challenging exercise, they were able to move 27% faster.
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:30.860]   They could do the exercise more quickly and they said it hurt 17% less.
[00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:32.940]   The exercise was exactly the same for all the people.
[00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:35.980]   We set the weight and we set the distance.
[00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:40.020]   It was in, you know, our lab space, so it was a constrained environment.
[00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:44.740]   Everybody was in the same sort of circumstance, but yet their experience was really different.
[00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:49.780]   We helped them to move faster, burn calories at a higher rate, exercise more efficiently.
[00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:55.300]   The amount of time they put in is going to produce a better physical outcome and it also
[00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:56.300]   didn't hurt them.
[00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:58.540]   They're saying it doesn't hurt as much.
[00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:02.340]   So we were really excited about that because it meant that this strategy, we could use
[00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:05.100]   it on people who are not elite athletes.
[00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:09.740]   It could be easily adopted, a quick training session, can teach people to look at the world
[00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:10.940]   in a different way.
[00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:15.900]   Again, this narrowed attention was different than whatever they do naturally, the comparison
[00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:17.060]   group.
[00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:18.060]   But it had a big outcome.
[00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:21.780]   It had a big difference on the way that they were engaged in the exercise.
[00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:26.380]   It was like some of the first work that we did and then since then we've done dozens
[00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:30.500]   more studies to look at, well, what happens with that and what else can we do with playing
[00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:31.500]   around with this?
[00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:36.180]   Yeah, those are impressive differences as a consequence of narrowing visual attention.
[00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:39.640]   A couple of questions about the actual practice of narrowing attention.
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:46.060]   Is there any indication of whether or not subjects are constantly updating their visual
[00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:47.060]   attention?
[00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:52.540]   So for instance, if let's say the goal line is in view, literally from the beginning,
[00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:56.180]   I could imagine just holding visual attention on the goal line.
[00:09:56.180 --> 00:10:03.580]   But if it's an oval track or it's a trajectory along a trail or through a city, how often
[00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:10.660]   do you think they are updating their visual aperture and setting a visual goal?
[00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:18.100]   And I could imagine that there's some energetic expense to that, meaning you wouldn't want
[00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:22.980]   to do every crack on the sidewalk unless those cracks on the sidewalk were very far apart.
[00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:26.900]   Because I think at some point that itself would be exhausting.
[00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:31.980]   So is there an optimal strategy or a semi-optimal strategy?
[00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:37.380]   Yeah, so those Olympic athletes that we started by interviewing, they tended to be sprinters.
[00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:39.860]   They were more often sprinters, short-distance sprinters.
[00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:45.060]   So when they said, yes, I narrow in more than I assume an expansive focus, that's because
[00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:46.900]   they're not going that far.
[00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:50.660]   They have to do it as fast as humanly possible, but they're not going that far.
[00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:54.340]   And so we started asking that question too about, well, wouldn't that be tiring?
[00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:55.620]   And the answer is yes.
[00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:58.380]   So when we start to look at, well, people who aren't sprinters, who are accomplished
[00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:04.460]   but who are more long-distance runners, that's what we find that they do, is that they're
[00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:07.780]   using that narrowed attention strategy strategically.
[00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:09.940]   And it increases in use.
[00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:12.540]   They use it more often as the race progresses.
[00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:19.100]   And they really start to do this major switch at about the halfway point of, say, a 10-kilometer
[00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:20.100]   run.
[00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:23.860]   So people who are seasoned runners, they really start making a switch with what they're looking
[00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:26.380]   at about halfway through.
[00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:29.900]   And that's where they more often, more frequently, and are more intentionally adopting a narrowed
[00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:35.700]   focus of attention, when they're in the last couple miles of a run, when maybe their resources
[00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:39.860]   are starting to get more thin, maybe their motivation is starting to fade.
[00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:45.000]   That tipping point in the middle is with any kind of goal where people struggle the most.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.100]   And that's when they're doubling down on a strategy that they know to be effective.
[00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:54.460]   So at first, longer-distance runners are not using that narrowed strategy.
[00:11:54.460 --> 00:12:00.180]   They're looking more expansively, because I think that-- well, first of all, distraction
[00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:01.180]   is a thing.
[00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:02.180]   It's useful.
[00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:05.660]   Not necessarily that they're distracting themselves, because people are still trying to hold pace
[00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:10.380]   and jostle among probably a more concentrated group of runners.
[00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:15.940]   But it is a strategy that they use and then wean off of as the race goes through.
[00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:20.540]   And it's particularly effective when we're looking for that last push, the last push
[00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:24.540]   to get over the finish line, when you might be literally neck and neck with somebody that
[00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:27.500]   you're trying to just beat out.
[00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:32.580]   Or when you're most tired, but you know that last push, you don't want to drop off.
[00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:37.180]   And when you want to push through hard through that finish line, that's when people are using
[00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:39.900]   it at its peak level of intensity.
[00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:48.060]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
