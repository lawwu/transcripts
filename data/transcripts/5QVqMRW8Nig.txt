[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720]   [Music]
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.360]   All right, let's see what we have here.
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.720]   Next is a question from Lily.
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.200]   Lily asks,
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.160]   "Given the nature of deep work,
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.080]   it is often hard to determine the quality of the work produced
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.520]   because it's rather nuanced.
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.920]   How do you deal with such ambiguity?"
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.720]   Well, Lily, I would say
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.160]   maybe look at how your career is going.
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.600]   So what is the non-nuanced factor here?
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.800]   Am I getting promoted? Is my salary going up?
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.840]   Am I in more demand?
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.760]   Am I being given more interesting projects?
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.760]   That's a pretty good proxy for
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.040]   am I producing high-quality output.
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.160]   So even if you can't look at the thing
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.720]   you just produced in the small scale,
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.080]   the report you just wrote,
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.600]   the strategy memo you just put together,
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.240]   and say, "Hey, this is an A+ or a B+ or whatever,"
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.200]   if over the course of six months or a year
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.560]   you're getting more interesting work,
[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.040]   you're being eyed for advancement,
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.960]   other people are trying to poach you away,
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.920]   that's a pretty good sign that things are going well.
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.400]   I mean, this reminds me of the maxim
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.320]   that I included in my book,
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.840]   "So Good They Can't Ignore You,"
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.760]   a maxim that came from the entrepreneur Derek Sivers,
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.640]   where he said, "When you're working on new things,
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:23.360]   deep things,
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.480]   money is a good neutral indicator of value."
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.400]   And what he meant by that,
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.520]   and we've mentioned this before on the show,
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.120]   but what he meant by that was
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.320]   people are reluctant to give other people their money.
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.920]   It's not a big deal to ask me to give you praise.
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.440]   I'm happy to do that.
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.720]   That doesn't cost me much to be,
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.400]   "Hey, this looks great."
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.080]   You know, like, "Hey, Jesse,
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.520]   I really like what you're doing over there.
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.560]   Keep up the good work."
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.160]   It doesn't cost me much to give praise.
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.640]   Ask me for money, though,
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.240]   I'm probably not going to give you money
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.520]   unless the stuff is actually good,
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.720]   unless the work is actually good,
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.360]   unless there's actually value in the product you're selling,
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.520]   there's value in the position you're filling in the company.
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.720]   So it's actually a really great way
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:03.920]   of getting honest feedback.
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.000]   So if you're getting promotions and raises,
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.280]   if people are trying to hire you away,
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.720]   then you're probably doing better work.
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.120]   And I always make the distinction,
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.840]   Derek was not saying money is what is valuable.
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.400]   So he wasn't saying your goal, therefore,
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.880]   should be to acquire as much money as possible.
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.880]   Obviously, he did the opposite.
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.280]   When he sold his company, CD Baby,
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.800]   for something like $20 million,
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.440]   he gave all the money away.
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.040]   It wasn't about having money.
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.360]   It was about, if I'm making money on this,
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.880]   if people are willing to pay for this,
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.720]   if people are willing to hire me for this,
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:41.920]   and that means this has value.
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.920]   And if they're not, I need to go back to the drawing board.
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.600]   And so keep that in mind.
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.360]   Look at the unambiguous indicators
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.960]   of your career going well.
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.480]   If those are trending in the right direction,
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.320]   you're probably doing the right amount
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.280]   of deep work and applying it to the right types of things.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.360]   If those indicators aren't going well,
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:06.880]   then maybe it's time to rethink things.
