[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:18.080]   - Hey, Jonathan, it's Rick.
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.280]   Just remember, you're the guy who put me on the map.
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.640]   I'll never forget that.
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:23.580]   Stay strong.
[00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.920]   Hi, Jonathan, Alan Roth here.
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.840]   First of all, thank you for everything you've done
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.600]   putting up with me for two decades.
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.760]   You've been instrumental to my career.
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.480]   You've taught me and, more importantly, so many people
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.600]   an understanding of money and happiness
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.280]   and reaching financial independence
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.720]   and how to enjoy that financial independence.
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.820]   Thank you, my friend.
[00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.320]   - Hi, Jonathan.
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.680]   I'm Alice at the Bogglehead Conference,
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.000]   and I just wanna thank you so much
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.240]   for your Humboldt Hour webpage
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.320]   and wish you all the best.
[00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.240]   Thank you again.
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.920]   - Hey, Jonathan, I miss you, Jane misses you,
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.640]   pretty much everybody else here misses you, too,
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.560]   and I'll see you in three or four months.
[00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.320]   - Jonathan, I just wanna say thank you
[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.760]   for everything you've done on the Humboldt Dollar
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.000]   and for the Boggleheads with the Boggleheads.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.600]   I've personally appreciated it.
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.580]   I know many, many others have also,
[00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.560]   and I think the most important thing
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.360]   that I know has happened is that you've made a difference,
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.240]   and that's about the most important thing
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.040]   that anyone could do for anyone else.
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.280]   So thank you, I'm very grateful.
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.120]   - Jonathan, thank you so much
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.360]   for your incomparable contributions
[00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.140]   to empower individual investors,
[00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.460]   your digestible style of writing, your accessibility.
[00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.440]   I am so grateful that you came and spoke
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.760]   to a New York City Boggleheads chapter meetup in person,
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.640]   incredibly generous with your time
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.200]   and knowledge and insights,
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.880]   and I secretly want for us to go for a bike ride,
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.840]   so I look forward to your recovery and more time together.
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.640]   Thanks again for everything you do.
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.480]   - Jonathan, you know you have made such a big impact
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.780]   on me personally, on my career trajectory,
[00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.280]   and certainly about how I think
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.500]   about investing in personal finance.
[00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.320]   You've also been a big topic of conversation
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.240]   at this conference, so much discussion
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.120]   about the impact that you've had on individual investors,
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.040]   how you've helped improve their financial decision-making.
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.160]   We ask the group here at the conference
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.360]   to share their thanks for you,
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.660]   and here's a video that they made.
[00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.500]   - Thank you, Jonathan!
[00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.260]   (dramatic music)
[00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.840]   (gentle music)
