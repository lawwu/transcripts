[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.500]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be
[00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:11.520]   found in Paul's epistle to the Ephesians in the second chapter and the seventh
[00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:17.160]   verse. The seventh verse in the second chapter of Paul's epistle to the
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:25.760]   Ephesians, that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his
[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:35.080]   grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus. Now that you will remember
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:41.760]   is the end of this great statement which begins at verse 4. But God who is rich in
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:49.360]   mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in sins,
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:56.640]   hath quickened us together with Christ. By grace ye are saved, and hath raised us
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:04.320]   up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus, that in
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:11.000]   the ages to come he might show the exceeding greatness, the exceeding riches
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.800]   of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus. The apostle you
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:24.160]   remember has here been reminding us of what it is that God has done for us in
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:30.640]   and through our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. When we were in that hopeless
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:37.100]   state, God has intervened, God has acted, and he has quickened us together with
[00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:43.180]   Christ, he has raised us up together with him in newness of life, and he has made
[00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:51.760]   us sit together with him in the heavenly places. But now the question arises, why
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:59.880]   has God done all this? What was the motive? What was it that led God to do
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:07.560]   all this for creatures such as we are? And the answer is given in this seventh
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.120]   verse, and introduced of course by this word "that" which comes at the very
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:20.240]   beginning. He has done all this "that" in order that to the intent that with the
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:28.280]   object or with the objective in view, that. Now this word "that" therefore is a
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:36.800]   tremendously important word, and it is absolutely vital that we should consider
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:44.040]   together what it is the apostle tells us here concerning this great purpose. How
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:50.080]   important it is for us to study the scriptures carefully, and to observe
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:59.480]   exactly what they say, because we can so easily misunderstand as indeed we do. And
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.560]   here I think as we consider this verse together this morning, we shall all
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.000]   probably feel up to a certain point degenerate that our view of Christianity,
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.600]   our view of the church, our view of ourselves as Christian people is
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:24.760]   defective, it's inadequate. Indeed our whole conception of salvation tends to
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.520]   be inadequate. Now I think we've already seen that as we've considered those
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:36.520]   three great steps in our salvation, as we've seen what is already true of us as
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:43.040]   Christians, because we are in Christ. We must have felt that we'd never truly
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:50.720]   realized as we ought the full meaning of regeneration, we hadn't fully grasped the
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:56.720]   completeness of justification, and our standing and status in the presence of
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:02.320]   God. And still less perhaps, as we were looking last Sunday morning at that
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:10.560]   statement about our being seated in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, how we
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.920]   fail and how tragically we fail to realize that that is the truth about us
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:21.960]   even at this present moment. In other words, it seems to me increasingly that
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:27.040]   most of our troubles in the Christian life arise from the fact that we will
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:33.720]   always start with our sevens, and we will live so much in the realm of feeling and
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:40.280]   the subjective. Now let's be clear about this. I've been making that point all
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.600]   these Sunday mornings, and again it is of the very essence of what one must say in
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.640]   expounding this seventh verse. Thank God there is a subjective element to
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:55.600]   salvation. Thank God for every feeling, for every experience, for everything that
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:01.520]   we are aware of within ourselves. If we are not aware of this subjective element,
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:08.320]   well then, our whole position, it seems to me, is a very uncertain one. But on the
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.280]   other hand, there is nothing which is quite so fatal as to think only in the
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:19.120]   subjective manner, and to fail to grasp with our minds and understanding this
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.640]   objective presentation of the truth, such as we have it in this section and in
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:31.960]   most of these New Testament epistles. What I mean is this, that if we only had
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:38.720]   this true scriptural conception of ourselves as we are as Christians and
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:43.920]   members of the body of Christ at this moment, believe me, most of the things
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:48.680]   that worry us would immediately fall off from us altogether. They'd appear to be
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:56.120]   so trivial, so small, so unimportant. Now this is something one can illustrate in
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:02.000]   this way. The best way to get rid of small things always is to look at big
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:10.360]   things. I wonder whether you ever read the interesting statistics which were
[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:16.220]   provided, I think, by the medical authorities in Barcelona in Spain during
[00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:21.920]   the Spanish Civil War just before the last world war. They were very
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:28.800]   interesting. A given number of people had been receiving various forms of
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:34.800]   psychotherapeutic and psychological treatments of various kinds. But the
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:40.640]   moment the civil war came and affected Barcelona acutely, the number dwindled
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:46.880]   almost to nothing. What was it due to? Well, it was the larger concern that had
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:51.080]   driven out the lesser concerns. And the same thing, of course, happened in this
[00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:56.960]   country during the last war. Many people, when suddenly the crisis came and
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:01.920]   husbands had to go off to battle, they forgot their aches and pains.
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:06.280]   These things which had been so prominent in their lives and had meant so much to
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:11.840]   them, they suddenly forgot all about them. Why? Well, a greater fear had driven out
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:19.760]   the lesser fears. The bigger crisis had made other things so trivial as really
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:26.200]   to be quite irrelevant. Now, we're all familiar with something like that. The
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:30.580]   big thing drives out the little things. Well, it's equally true in the Christian
[00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:36.520]   life. We tend to go on, and we are troubled by this and that, and we tend to
[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:41.720]   grumble and to complain, and we wonder why God is dealing with us like this and
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:46.040]   why that's allowed to happen to us. And so we go on in the Christian life. I say
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:53.160]   the antidote to all that is really to see ourselves as we are objectively in
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:59.080]   the purpose of God. And if we could but do that, all these things would disappear.
[00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:04.880]   Or if, let me put it like this, if we really had but some conception of the
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:10.760]   glory which awaits us and to which we are going, it would transform our view of
[00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:16.200]   life in this world and of the things that happen to us in this world. Well,
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:20.280]   now, that's the sort of thing that the Apostle Isaiah is going to do in this
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:25.720]   seventh verse. This is the cure for self-centeredness and self-occupation
[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:30.760]   and self-concern, which leads eventually to introspection and morbidity and
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:36.480]   various other forms of trouble. The thing to do, and that's why the Apostle writes
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:40.400]   this letter, that's why every New Testament letter was ever written, in
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:46.640]   order to get these people to lift up their heads and to see themselves
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:53.560]   objectively in the grand purpose and plan of God. Very well then, let's look at
[00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:59.380]   it like this. Why has God done all this? Why has he intervened? Why has he
[00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:05.240]   quickened us and raised us and set us to sit with Christ in the heavenly places?
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:10.720]   Well, the answer is, says the Apostle, this is a part of his great and his grand
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:16.520]   purpose. That, in order of it. Now, let me put it to you in the form of a number of
[00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:26.800]   propositions. The first is this, the chief end, intent, and object of salvation is
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:35.400]   the glory of God. That's why he's done it. He's done it by that in the ages to come,
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:46.360]   he, God himself, might show the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness and
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:52.720]   toward us through Christ Jesus. God has done all this, says Paul, in order that he
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:10:00.640]   can present a spectacle to all future ages, not only in this world but also in
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:07.640]   that which is to come. God is going to give a great demonstration. He is going
[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:16.000]   to manifest his own glory. Now you notice that that is the thing which the Apostle
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:23.600]   puts first. That's the chief reason why God has done all this, he says. Now
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:27.880]   immediately, you see, the question arises, do we normally think of these things like
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:34.480]   that? Isn't it the truth to say of all of us, probably, that we do the exact
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:39.520]   opposite? We start with ourselves, and we think of salvation as something for me,
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:44.480]   something I need, something I want, something that I'm concerned about. We
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:50.120]   are always subjective, we always start with ourselves. But my dear friend, the
[00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:54.680]   first thing we've got to learn is this, that the first objective and the first
[00:10:54.680 --> 00:11:01.160]   intent in salvation is, don't misunderstand me, in a sense nothing to do
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:08.260]   with us at all, but the glory of God. Now that's the teaching of the whole
[00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:15.000]   Scripture, from beginning to end. In other words, we must not start, as we
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:24.360]   habitually do, with even our own sins, but with sin. We must learn to view all
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:31.480]   these things more historically. It's extremely difficult, isn't it? It's
[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:37.320]   extremely difficult for any generation to take the historical view, because, you
[00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:42.720]   see, here we are, we are in the world at this moment, and there are these problems.
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:46.880]   We hear the news on the wireless, we see the headlines in the papers, in this
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:50.280]   world in which you and I live at this moment, there are all these problems and
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:53.560]   trials and difficulties, and we are immersed in them, and we tend to see
[00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:58.320]   nothing else. It's extremely difficult, isn't it, to realize that there were
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:04.520]   people in this world a hundred years ago, and that they had problems and
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:09.000]   difficulties. It's still more difficult to realize that there were people in
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.440]   this world a thousand years ago, who never thought of us at all. We never
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:17.040]   entered into their minds, nor their calculations. We think we are so
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:21.760]   important, and this is the world, and this is the whole of history, our little
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:27.760]   sector. They knew nothing about us, and never gave us a thought. And we can be
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:32.360]   equally certain that in a hundred years, and if our Lord has not returned before
[00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:37.560]   then, or before a thousand years, the generations at that time will never give
[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:43.320]   us a thought at all. We'll seem indeed most unimportant and insignificant. But
[00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:48.280]   how difficult it is for us to realize that. And yet, you know, that's the sort
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:54.080]   of thing we've got to do. We've got to learn to view ourselves, and the whole
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:59.360]   problem of man, the whole crisis of history, and especially the whole subject
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:08.040]   of salvation, in this objective historical manner. What I mean is this.
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:18.800]   Instead of starting with myself, and my own sins, and my own problems, I must
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:26.960]   learn to think in terms of sin, and the whole problem of men, and the whole
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:34.960]   problem of evil in this world. Now it's only as I do that that I'll begin to see
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:40.160]   what the Apostle means when he says that the first intent and object of salvation
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:49.400]   is the glory of God. Now look at it in this way. It's very difficult for us to
[00:13:49.400 --> 00:14:01.520]   realize what sin and the fall meant to God. Sin is that which is utterly opposed
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:09.320]   to God. And therefore, what has happened as the result of sin leading to the fall,
[00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:15.320]   and all its consequences in the world and amongst men, is, if I may put it
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:24.040]   reverently, a tremendous matter in the sight and in the view of God. You see, we
[00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:27.760]   will persist in thinking of this whole problem in terms of particular sins, this
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:33.440]   thing that gets me down, and the sins we put up in a list, you know, drunkenness
[00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:37.720]   and so on and so forth, that to us is the whole problem. You see, if we turn the
[00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:42.360]   problem of sin more or less into a social problem, it's either a social
[00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:46.120]   problem or the problem of my own personal happiness. I don't like the
[00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:50.200]   feeling of remorse, I don't like repentance, it's painful and so on. Now, we
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:54.840]   reduce the whole great problem of sin to such proportions and to such dimensions,
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:15:03.960]   but the Bible doesn't. The Bible views all this as an attack upon God. The devil
[00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:11.240]   came forward and he asserted himself against God. He raised himself up against
[00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:18.360]   the majesty and the sovereignty and the glory of God. He disputed this. He wanted
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:24.800]   to set himself up, at the very least, as a rival God. And when he saw God coming to
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:30.000]   create the world and coming to create men, and God looking at it and saying
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.080]   that it was all very good, and God was pleased with it, the devil said, "I'll show
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:40.600]   that this isn't the case." And he entered in, and what was his object? Do you think
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:46.720]   the object of the devil was merely to persuade Eve and Adam to do just one
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:51.800]   particular thing? Of course it wasn't. The devil had but one idea in his mind, and
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:57.600]   that was to detract from the glory and the majesty and the greatness of God. He
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:01.920]   wasn't merely concerned in what should happen to Adam and Eve. The devil takes
[00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:06.080]   very little interest in you and I as persons. We are not persons to him, we are
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:10.760]   pawns. We are simply things that he can use in the great game, and yet, you see,
[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:16.440]   we think of it all in terms of ourselves. The devil regards us with contempt as he
[00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:20.200]   did Adam and Eve. He fawned to them, he flattered them, because he knew that that
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:24.040]   was the way in order to make pawns of them. He had no interest in them at all.
[00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:30.200]   His one object, I say, was to detract from the glory and the majesty and the
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:36.040]   greatness of God. He was out to spoil God's work and God's world. He was out to
[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:41.600]   ridicule it. He wanted to stand up and to be able to address all the holy angels
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:46.760]   and say God makes claims for himself. He says he's made a perfect world, but look
[00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:57.840]   at it. There it is. That's the way to look at the problem of sin. The fall, I say, was
[00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:04.520]   a terrible thing in God's sight. That's the way to look at it. It isn't a social
[00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:13.440]   problem. It is this tremendous problem in the sight of God. And that, you see, is the
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:18.960]   way we must look at the world as it is today. Of course, there is a social
[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:25.640]   problem. Sin raises many social problems, but that's the byproduct. That's not the
[00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:30.960]   real thing that makes sin sin. That's not the real problem. If I may so put it, God
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:34.120]   would never have sent his Son from heaven to earth and to the cross on
[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:42.400]   Calvary to solve a social problem. He certainly wouldn't, and he hasn't. Oh no.
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:49.280]   The problem to God was his own glory, his own majesty, his own everlasting
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:55.980]   greatness. This has been queried and questioned by the devil and all who
[00:17:55.980 --> 00:18:03.840]   belong to him. And what is salvation? Well, salvation, the whole purpose and
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:14.440]   object of salvation in the first instance, is to vindicate God, is for God
[00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:21.400]   again to manifest the truth concerning himself. The devil is described in the
[00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:27.060]   scripture as a liar and the father of liars. And the Apostle John tells us in
[00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:32.080]   his first epistle in the third chapter that God sent his Son into this world in
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:41.640]   order to destroy the works of the devil. That's the first object, that the whole
[00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:47.480]   character of God should be vindicated. Of course, the devil in an ultimate sense
[00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:54.400]   did not and cannot and could not affect the being and the character and the
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:59.480]   nature of God. But in the sight of created beings he can, and he most
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:04.920]   certainly did. He succeeded in the case of all the fallen angels, he succeeded in
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:10.360]   the case of Adam and Eve, and the whole of their posterity. And the whole problem
[00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:15.360]   in the world today is the attitude of men towards God. And God, I say, has
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:23.000]   initiated this great movement of redemption and of salvation primarily in
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:30.920]   order to declare and to manifest and to vindicate again his own glory, his own
[00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:37.440]   greatness, the truth concerning himself. Why has he done it? He has done it that
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:45.480]   in the ages to come he might full display the exceeding riches of his
[00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:55.400]   grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus. Have you thought of
[00:19:55.400 --> 00:20:02.680]   salvation like that, my friends? We are approaching the Christmas season. That's
[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:10.800]   the question to ask. Why did God ever send his Son? Why? God forbid that we
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:17.440]   should give some sentimental, subjective answers only and fail to see that God
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:25.360]   sent him in order to vindicate himself. It's the grandest theodicy of the ages.
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:35.280]   God is vindicating and declaring and showing the truth concerning himself. But
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:42.280]   let me put it then in the form of a second proposition. Salvation does this,
[00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:47.360]   in other words, it vindicates the greatness and the character of God in a
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:53.800]   special way and manner in which nothing else does so. And there is no question
[00:20:53.800 --> 00:21:02.080]   about this. We learn certain things about God in this whole movement of salvation
[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:08.520]   and of redemption which we would never have known otherwise. Now that may sound
[00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:14.920]   a daring statement but I venture to make it. People have often asked the question,
[00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:18.680]   nobody can answer it, but it's a question that many have asked and
[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:26.200]   probably all of us have asked it. Why did the Almighty God ever allow the fall?
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:33.200]   Why did he ever allow men to fall into sin? I say the ultimate answer is that we
[00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:37.720]   don't know and we shouldn't inquire because it's beyond us. But at the end of
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:44.960]   it we can say this and we know this. If God had not allowed the possibility, men
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:48.120]   would have not been entirely free and therefore he would not have been
[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:53.960]   entirely perfect. Men, as God made him, really did have free will. He lost it by
[00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:57.400]   falling into sin but he had it originally and therefore it's a part of
[00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:04.880]   men's perfection. But I want to raise another possibility. Is it conceivable, I
[00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:10.560]   wonder, that God permitted it also in order that through redemption he might
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:16.400]   display certain attributes of his holy being and nature and character which
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:21.740]   otherwise could never be known in this way but which now most certainly are
[00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:27.160]   known? The Apostle has already mentioned some of them. Listen to him. God who is
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:35.360]   rich in mercy. Would it be possible to have the same conception of the richness
[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:43.000]   of God's mercy if men had not fallen into sin as he has done? It is through
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:53.200]   this that God manifests the endlessness of his mercy, rich in mercy. "For his
[00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:58.960]   great love wherewith he loved us." Well, men knew something about the love of God
[00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:04.880]   before he fell. Adam knew the love of God. I wonder whether the love of God would
[00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:10.840]   ever have been known as it's now known, were it not for the fall and the
[00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:16.920]   movement of redemption. God's showing it. He's displaying it. He's manifesting it.
[00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:23.360]   There is an unveiling of it in a manner that surely is not conceivable apart
[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:29.800]   from this. And then he goes on, you remember, to this next great term. "Even
[00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:34.360]   when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by grace." There it
[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:39.160]   comes in. "And hath by grace he has saved and hath raised us up together and made
[00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:43.480]   us sit together in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come
[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:53.600]   he might show the exceeding riches of his grace." Oh, there's nothing that enables us
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:24:01.080]   to have some understanding of the extent of this grace of God, such as this does.
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:08.000]   It's the ultimate measure of it and nothing can show it as this shows it. And
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:15.760]   then that last term is the term kindness, you remember. In his kindness, in his look
[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:21.560]   of benignity. Oh, Adam knew something about the kindness of God. But you know, I
[00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:34.240]   do agree with Isaac Watts. When he claims in his hymn, "In Him, in Christ," the tribes
[00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:43.720]   of Adam boast more blessings than their father lost. I say it reverently and
[00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:50.760]   weighing my words that we in Christ know something of God which Adam didn't know
[00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:59.640]   and which, in a sense, I venture to say Adam could not know. I don't know. It may
[00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:03.920]   be speculation, but it seems to me to be the teaching of the Scripture that God
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:09.560]   has shown things here in a unique manner and in a way that he has never shown
[00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:14.080]   anywhere else. But now this is the thing that really is most important for us, my
[00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:23.080]   third principle. All this display and vindication of the character and the
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:32.400]   being and the greatness and the glory of God comes to pass through the church. God
[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:38.800]   does this tremendous thing by means of us and through us, in the first instance.
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:45.240]   I must read it again. He's done all this that in the ages to come he might show
[00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:53.880]   the exceeding richness of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ
[00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:59.200]   Jesus. Now this is to me the most overwhelming thought that you and I can
[00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:05.880]   ever lay hold of, that the almighty everlasting eternal God is vindicating
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:11.800]   himself and his holy nature and being by something that he does in us and with us
[00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:18.440]   and through us. That's Christianity. That's the meaning of church membership.
[00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:24.280]   That's what it is to be a Christian, nothing less than that. You see, we've
[00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:28.000]   been taken right out of our little subjective states and moods and feelings
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:34.160]   and passing conditions and we see ourselves suddenly in this great
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:40.480]   plan of eternity which God brought into being and into operation as the result
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:48.880]   and consequent upon the fall of man into sin. Now I want to show you something of
[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:55.760]   this conception. The Apostle teaches it very plainly here in this verse. Did you
[00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:59.600]   notice it in the reading at the beginning in the third chapter of this
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:06.440]   epistle in the tenth verse? Let me read it to you. The Apostle is again
[00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:11.160]   describing this great mystery which had been hidden but which now has
[00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:17.200]   been revealed. What is it for? It is to make all men see what is the fellowship
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:21.920]   of the mystery which from the beginning of the world had been hid in God who
[00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:29.120]   created all things by Jesus Christ. Now then, verse 10. To the intent that, the
[00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:34.320]   same idea, this is the object, this is the intent, this is the purpose. To the intent
[00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:43.760]   that now unto the principalities and powers in the heavenly places might be
[00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:59.120]   known by the church the manifold wisdom of God. That's the idea. God is using the
[00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:04.880]   church and is going to use the church in the future ages. In order to give a
[00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:09.440]   demonstration and an exhibition to the principalities and the powers in the
[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:15.280]   heavenly places, God is vindicating himself and his character by you and by
[00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:20.400]   me, by people such as ourselves, by the whole of the church gathered out of the
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:25.000]   world in Christ. He's going to put us on display as it were. There's going to be a
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:29.080]   glorious exhibition. He's already doing it but it's going to continue in the
[00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:34.720]   ages to come and at the final end God is going to open his last great exhibition
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:39.200]   and all these heavenly powers and principalities will be invited to attend
[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:48.240]   and the curtain will draw back and God will say, look at them. To the intent that
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:54.440]   now unto the principalities and powers in the heavenly places might be known by
[00:28:54.440 --> 00:29:06.240]   the church the manifold wisdom of God. And you and I have been prepared for
[00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:13.640]   that. You read of the artists preparing their paintings and their drawings for
[00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:20.000]   the exhibition, don't you? The final touches, the frame must be right, must be
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.360]   put in the right position, the light must be in the right position. We all know
[00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:28.800]   about it. You've seen people preparing animals to show them in horse shows or
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:34.120]   fruit and vegetables for a horticultural show. The picking out, the preparing. Well
[00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:37.520]   that's what's happening to you and to me. That's the meaning of a service such
[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:42.480]   like this. It's just a part of it. The exhibition, the show, the display, it's
[00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:50.400]   coming. And the astounding and amazing thing is that it's through people like
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:55.400]   ourselves and as the result of what he's doing to us and has done to us and will
[00:29:55.400 --> 00:30:01.740]   do to us, that God is going to vindicate his own eternal wisdom and his majesty
[00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:06.840]   and his glory and all the attributes of his holy person to the principalities
[00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:16.560]   and the heavenly powers. I rather like the way it's put in that portion of the
[00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:21.480]   book of Revelation that we read together at the beginning. Did you notice it? It
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:28.600]   seems to me to put it all very perfectly. John has his vision, "I beheld a great
[00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:34.720]   multitude which no men could number, of all nations and kindreds and people and
[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:41.280]   tongues, stood before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:48.720]   and palms in their hands, and cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:55.160]   which sitteth upon the throne and unto the Lamb." John saw them. These people
[00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:59.440]   clad in the white robes and with the palms in their hands, singing the praise
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:04.920]   of God and saying, Salvation to our God that sitteth upon the throne. Then it's
[00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:14.880]   the question I like. The angel that stood by him turned to John and said, "One of
[00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:23.480]   one of the elders rather answered, saying unto me, Who are these? Who are these
[00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:27.720]   that are arrayed in white robes and that are standing here with palms in their
[00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:33.720]   hands and singing the praises of God? Who are these?" You see that will be the
[00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:37.840]   question asked by the principalities and powers in the heavenly places. The
[00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:42.040]   curtain will be withdrawn and there they'll be, in their now white robes and
[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:46.640]   with the palms. Who are these? What are they? What's this phenomenon? What are
[00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:53.340]   these people? Where have they come from? That's the second question. And the
[00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:59.360]   answer is, of course, that they're just Christian people, the Christians of all
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:07.040]   the centuries, of all nations and tribes and countries and colors, gathered out by
[00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:11.520]   the power of Christ's redemption throughout the ages, all gathered
[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:18.240]   together finally. There they are in the glory. Who are these? Where have they come
[00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:25.480]   from? What are they? And the answer is, these are the redeemed by the wisdom and
[00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:36.400]   the power and the glory and the love and the grace of God. By the church, you and
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:43.360]   I, miserable creatures that we are, with our aches and pains and mumps and
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:48.080]   measles of the soul and our questions and queryings, and why does God do this
[00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:55.080]   and that? Oh, I beseech you, look into heaven, cast your mind into glory. Shame
[00:32:55.080 --> 00:33:04.840]   on us Christian people for our wretched subjectivity and our failure to realize
[00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:11.920]   what's happening to us, who we are and what we are, and what God is doing in us
[00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:19.120]   and through us. This is the intent of salvation, that all this might be done to
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:26.320]   the vindication of the character and the glory of God. I needn't keep you, but I'll
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:29.980]   give you my headings. The next principle is going to be this, to show you how God
[00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:36.720]   does this through the church. We needn't stay, we've already considered it in a
[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:45.280]   sense. There we are in the white robes, with the palms, in the glory, in the
[00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:55.360]   presence of God. How have we got there? How has it happened? Well, the first thing is
[00:33:55.360 --> 00:34:01.840]   that he's ever looked upon us at all, such as we were, dead in trespasses and
[00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:07.640]   sins, walking according to the course of this world, the spirit that now worketh
[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:12.400]   in the children of disobedience, amongst whom we all had our conversation in
[00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:18.960]   times past, in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and
[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:26.800]   of the mind, and were the children of wrath, even as others. How could he ever
[00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:33.600]   have looked upon us? We deserve nothing but retribution and punishment and hell.
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:39.080]   If you feel that you deserve anything better, you don't know what you are as a
[00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:45.400]   sinner, and you'd know nothing, I'm afraid, about the grace of God. Miserable, vile,
[00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:52.520]   foul wretches and rebels. That he ever looked upon us even? What a display of
[00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:59.520]   his being and of his holy nature. We are a demonstration of that, you see. If he
[00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:04.800]   hadn't looked upon us, we'd be still there and going to perdition. But we are
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:10.620]   here in glory because he looked upon us and had mercy and had pity upon us. Not
[00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:16.360]   only that, he devised and planned a way of delivering us. He made the way of
[00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:21.960]   salvation himself. Man didn't ask for it. Man didn't want it. Man didn't know what
[00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:27.280]   he needed. Man wasn't consulted. He hasn't put in a single suggestion. Salvation is
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:33.200]   entirely God's from beginning to end. That's the Apostle's whole point. By grace
[00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:40.160]   you have been saved and nothing else. What a display of the being and the
[00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:48.040]   character of God. And then that he should have done to us what he has done, that he
[00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:54.960]   should have made of us what he has made, that we are already quickened, that he's
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:36:00.640]   put a principle of spiritual life into us who are utterly, absolutely, hopelessly
[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:08.320]   dead. He's put new life into us, his own life. He's raised us up together with
[00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:13.120]   Christ. We are alive to him. We have the new interests and the new outlook. We are
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:16.840]   seated in the heavenly places as we've seen. He's done all this already to us.
[00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:24.120]   And you know by when we are there in the glory with the white robe and the palm,
[00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:33.360]   we shall be absolutely perfect, without spot or even a wrinkle or any such thing.
[00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:38.960]   Not a suspicion of a blemish. The most powerful magnifying glass will find
[00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:47.080]   nothing wrong about us. Absolutely whole and entire, purified from all traces of
[00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:53.440]   sin. It's not surprising that the elders ask, "Who are these? And how have they
[00:36:53.440 --> 00:37:03.760]   become like this? What this spotless whiteness, this glory?" And it all you see
[00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:10.480]   is but this manifestation of God's character and being. He does all this, not
[00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:14.360]   only through the church, he does it in that particular way. Very well, that
[00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:20.680]   brings me to my last principle, which is just a series of questions. How should we
[00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:28.440]   therefore think of ourselves in the light of all this? Well, it's obvious,
[00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:35.560]   isn't it? If you think at all of your own goodness, it just means that you've never
[00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:41.480]   seen this at all. If you think that you're a Christian and a good church
[00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:45.120]   member because you've lived a good life and never done anybody any harm and
[00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:49.400]   indeed you're giving a good deal of your time to these things, you're just telling
[00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:56.120]   me that you've never seen it. If you can find anything in yourself at this moment
[00:37:56.120 --> 00:38:02.520]   to be pleased about, well I just know that you've never seen this idea, that
[00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:07.800]   God has done it all to the intent that no one to the principalities and powers
[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:11.920]   in the heavenly places might be known his own manifold wisdom, that he might
[00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:20.320]   display the exceeding riches of his grace. If you feel you've got any plea to
[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:24.840]   offer at the throne of grace and of mercy, say of the name of Jesus Christ,
[00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:33.520]   you've just never seen it. You're just blind. Oh, our one thought should be this,
[00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:51.120]   a debtor to mercy alone. Of covenant mercy, I sing, I am what I am by the grace
[00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:58.680]   of God. Nothing in me, nothing in my hands I bring, I find no good in myself. In me
[00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:02.160]   that is to say in my flesh dwelleth no good thing at all. I have nothing to
[00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:07.480]   recommend me, I've nothing to boast of at all, I'm nothing, he's everything, God,
[00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:15.000]   his grace in Christ Jesus. If you see this, that's the inevitable way in which
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:21.400]   you must think. And it follows from that, doesn't it, that we should also conduct
[00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:28.280]   ourselves in a given way. Every man that hath this hope in him purifieth
[00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:36.480]   himself, even as he is pure. A man who has seen himself as a member of the church
[00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:41.520]   and of the body of Christ in this way that we are looking at this morning, will
[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:45.760]   no longer want to keep as near as he can to the world, and he won't regard
[00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:49.520]   Christianity as narrow, because he knows in his heart of heart that it condemns
[00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:58.400]   certain things, not for a moment. If we could but see those whom we know who've
[00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:05.480]   now gone beyond the veil, we'd say farewell to most of the things of this
[00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:11.200]   world. It's because we don't see it, we don't know it, we don't really believe it.
[00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:17.160]   Oh, any man who sees this, any man who hath this hope in him purifieth himself,
[00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:21.960]   even as he is pure. If you know you're going to be absolutely pure and spotless,
[00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:26.760]   well, get on with it. Wash your hands, cleanse your hearts, ye double-minded.
[00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:33.160]   These are the appeals. Get as far away from the world as you can. Haste thee on,
[00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:42.240]   from grace to glory. The other thing I find here is the absolute certainty of
[00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:52.400]   it all and the assurance of it all. If my confidence of my final salvation and of
[00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:58.920]   my ultimate perfection rested in myself, my own energy, my own zeal, my own
[00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:07.080]   purposes and desires, I know that I'd never get there. My assurance is based on
[00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:18.840]   this, that God, the infinite eternal God, is vindicating his own eternal character
[00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:30.640]   through me. And if he started saving me and then left it undone or unfinished
[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:39.840]   and I ever arrived in hell, the devil would have the greatest joke of eternity.
[00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:47.320]   He'd say, "There's a being that God began to save and failed to complete." It's
[00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:53.600]   impossible, it can't happen. There is no more monstrous idea than the idea that
[00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:58.360]   you can fall away from grace, that you can never be born again and then be
[00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:06.880]   damned. The character of God is involved. It's impossible. It's not merely to save
[00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:12.440]   me, it's to vindicate his own being and nature, and I'm being used to that end.
[00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:18.960]   I'm getting all the benefits. But the thing's absolutely certain because God's
[00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:26.640]   character is involved in it. He that hath begun a good work in you will perform it
[00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:35.120]   until the day of Jesus Christ. And the last word is an obvious one, isn't it?
[00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:45.720]   The privilege of it all. The privilege of being used of God in this way, to vindicate his
[00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:57.440]   own eternal glorious character. Why am I in this? Why did he ever look upon me? As
[00:42:57.440 --> 00:43:05.120]   the elder asks, "Who are these?" I ask, "Who am I?" Do you remember David asking the
[00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:10.600]   question? When God gave him a glimpse of where he came into this great plan, "Who am
[00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:18.360]   I or what is my house that this great honor should come to me?" Don't we all
[00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:25.560]   feel like saying that? Who am I and what am I? That God should ever have looked
[00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:34.520]   upon me and chosen me to be a part of his plan and his purpose, to vindicate
[00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:41.440]   himself, his greatness, his glory, his wisdom, his love, his mercy, his kindness,
[00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:50.360]   his compassion before the principalities and the powers in the heavenly places.
[00:43:50.360 --> 00:44:01.000]   Christian people, think of yourselves like that and go on to glory.
[00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:05.280]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
