[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.120]   Here's a wonderful question from a dad of teenagers named Ryan. Ryan is a ministry partner
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.640]   with us at Desiring God and he and his wife recently joined us in the beautiful state
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:18.800]   of Washington. And there you led a few look at the book sessions, Pastor John, which is
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.600]   where you teach the Bible by drawing on the Bible text on your iPad. After the event,
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.240]   Ryan wrote us to ask this, "Pastor John, hello. Watching you work through scripture
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.440]   in lab form is so encouraging to my own soul and my own Bible study. Thank you. As we look
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.200]   to disciple our teenage children at home, however, we can feel inadequate explaining
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.760]   passages this way and are concerned that we are either missing the point or worse, teaching
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.520]   them incorrectly. Do you recommend using techniques like you do in lab when training children,
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.080]   or do you recommend another technique? How can parents of teens train their kids to do
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.520]   something lab-like?"
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:01.120]   Well, it seems to me that the first thing a parent has to reckon with is whether the
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:08.240]   setting has been created in the family or in the church where this kind of teaching
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.480]   will feel suitable for the young person. So yes, I do think we should try to teach our
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.600]   young people, but this question of have we created the setting? And what I mean is,
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.760]   is the family used to having devotions which simply involves, say, the reading of scripture
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:34.160]   and prayer? If so, it may feel awkward or strange if we suddenly turn that kind of
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:40.400]   moment in our family into a classroom setting with assignments and questions and so on.
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:47.040]   So it seems to me that every family has to come to terms with, can we create a time or
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:53.040]   a setting in the family or in the church with a fellowship of younger people or just a family
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.520]   where something like a classroom situation with expectations of rigorous thinking and
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.840]   questions and answers and analysis and assignments feels natural, even exciting.
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:15.040]   The mindset needs to be created that these sessions are meant to inculcate a skill, just
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:22.160]   like you would inculcate a skill of cooking into one of your children or a skill of cutting the
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.040]   grass or tying a knot on a fish hook so that when the big fish gets on there, he won't come off.
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:35.520]   The point is not that in every moment of those sessions that you'll experience the fullest
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:42.320]   joyful payoff of discovery, but later you get to eat the meal, you get to see the beautifully
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.120]   cut lawn, you get to catch the fish without losing your hook. You're trying to inculcate
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.640]   a skill for a lifetime, and so the parent needs to come to terms with, can I create
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:03:01.440]   a setting in the family where the teaching of skill can happen? And then, once you've got that
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:08.960]   figured out, which I hope they can, the question becomes, what do you do with that time?
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:18.640]   And here's one suggestion. What's guiding my suggestion here is that the goal of this teaching
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:26.160]   is a lifelong habit of mind and heart to approach the Scriptures in a certain way. In other words,
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:34.720]   being able to do a particular technique is not the goal. So, trying to reproduce Piper
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:45.280]   lab experiences is not the goal, but the habits of mind, the habits of heart that you inculcate or
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:52.560]   that you build into your children while working through those techniques, that's the goal.
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:58.400]   So, I would explain that goal to my children. I'd say, "That's what we're after here. I'm not
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.360]   trying to make a little John Piper out of you or a little whatever out of you. I just want to build
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:11.040]   into you certain habits of mind and habits of heart so that you will approach the Scriptures
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:18.560]   fruitfully for the rest of your life." And as a means of that, I'd say, "Well, perhaps assign them
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:26.800]   to watch one or two labs a day for a week or two, and as they watch, tell them, jot down the kind of
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:33.360]   questions that you see John Piper is asking and answering. Write them down. What is he asking?
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.960]   What's he after? Be as specific as you can." Or another way to say it would be, "What are the
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:47.600]   specifics that Piper is looking for as he analyzes the text? Make a list. Be specific." And this will
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:55.600]   be a challenge, especially because oftentimes we don't have vocabulary for what we're seeing. This
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:03.600]   is huge. A huge part of learning a skill is being able to talk about what you're seeing. And if you
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:09.920]   don't have words for what you're seeing, it becomes very difficult. What if you're cooking a
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:15.760]   recipe and it says, "Add oregano"? Well, you don't have a clue what oregano is, so you may be very
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:21.600]   skilled in cooking it. But if you don't know the vocabulary, and the same thing with reading a text
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:27.280]   or grammar or defining relationships between propositions. So let me, while I'm on that,
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:35.280]   let me just say that in my book, Reading the Bible Supernaturally, I have a list of all that
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:42.640]   vocabulary that you need in order to, I think it's like pages, I looked it up yesterday, like 397
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:51.280]   to 402 or something like that. And the list of all the relationships and all the vocabulary,
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:57.760]   the names you need to talk about what I'm suggesting are there. So let me do this. I want
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:02.400]   to give you the answer to the question, "What is Piper looking for?" This is what you want your
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:11.600]   kids to find, okay? So I have seven questions that I'm asking as I come to a text. So number one,
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:18.160]   what is the meaning of a particular word in a context? The same word can have many different
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:23.840]   meanings in different settings. So how does Piper decide on which meaning the word has in this
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:29.680]   particular setting? And the answer is that he looks at the most immediate context, the sentence
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:35.120]   in which the word is used, and then he looks at the paragraph, and then he looks at the book in
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:39.840]   which the, that is the, like it's Ephesians or Romans in which the word is used. And then he
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.840]   looks at the rest of Paul's writings, and then he looks at the whole Bible. So there's a kind of
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:51.280]   concentric circles as he moves out from those immediate context, and the most immediate context
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:57.840]   would have the greatest force or power, authority in defining a word. Second, what are the
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:03.840]   propositions that the author has created by putting words together? Propositions are the
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:09.920]   basic building blocks of meaning. Words get their meaning from their use in propositions,
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:15.520]   and propositions are the most basic assertions. They usually have a subject and a verb with some
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:21.920]   modifiers. So we might be looking at Romans 1:16, and the word we want to define is "gospel,"
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:29.280]   and the proposition in which it stands is "I am not ashamed of the gospel." That's what I mean by
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:36.400]   words and propositions. Third, how are the propositions related to each other? Does the
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:43.520]   proposition start with "because," or does it start with "therefore," or "in order that," or "although,"
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:52.720]   or "when," or so on? It really helps to have names for all these relationships, and that's what I was
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:59.920]   referring to on pages 396 to 401, I think it is, in reading the Bible supernaturally. This is the
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:05.280]   way an author communicates his meaning. He puts words together in propositions, then he puts
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:10.640]   propositions together in certain logical relationships. So, for example, we notice in
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:17.200]   Romans 1:16, "I am not ashamed of the gospel," and that has a relationship to what's in front and
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:24.800]   what's behind. It says, "I am eager to preach the gospel to you who are in Rome because I am not
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:31.680]   ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God unto salvation." So you have three links
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:39.440]   in a chain of argument. When I began to see that as a 22-year-old, my world exploded with excitement
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:46.560]   and insight. Number four, what's the flow of the argument as these propositions with their
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:55.840]   relationships pile up, and what's the main point in this flow? Number five, what are the similar
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:09:02.080]   flows of thought elsewhere in the Bible? For example, in this "I am not ashamed of the gospel"
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:09.040]   flow in Romans 1, we might go over to 2 Timothy 1:12, where Paul says, "I'm not ashamed because
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:15.600]   I know whom I have believed," and asked, "What's the relationship between the flow of thought in how
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:24.000]   shame is overcome in 2 Timothy and how shame is overcome in Romans 1?" And when I make comparisons
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:30.320]   like that, similar flows of thought compared side by side, insights multiply. Number six,
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:38.240]   what's the actual reality—this is so important—the reality behind the words and propositions and
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:42.560]   flows of thought? Lots of young people and older people, when they're getting excited about
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:47.680]   seeing the meaning of words, seeing how propositions work, seeing how logical flows of
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:54.800]   thought develop, they get all excited about words and logic, and suddenly they're playing a game,
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:10:04.000]   and they're forgetting that there's heaven and hell and life and death and God and Satan. Massive
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:11.920]   realities are behind these words, and so I want to push myself through words into reality. That's
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:19.040]   number six. What's the reality? And finally, number seven, what are the personal applications
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:25.120]   that I can make of the author's meaning to my life and the world around me? And in all seven
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:32.720]   of those questions, the most helpful tool is the concordance—that is, the book or the computer
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:39.760]   program that enables you to see all of an author's use of a particular word, every place it's used.
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:47.760]   This is my most commonly used tool in Bible study. Commentaries don't even come close. Bible
[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:56.480]   dictionaries don't even come close. What issues all the insight, almost 90-plus percent, are
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:11:05.600]   looking up words that put me onto the trail of trains of thought in an author's mind.
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:11.360]   And once you have helped your children identify those seven kinds of questions,
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:18.880]   you simply want them to form the lifelong habit of asking and answering those questions. And you
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:25.600]   can't do it for them. They have to do that for themselves, and you can do that by working through
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:32.320]   texts with those questions. You can do it together. You can assign them to do it, and over and over.
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:41.760]   One last suggestion. Writing down the answers for every text to those seven questions is vastly more
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:49.280]   fruitful than trying to do it in your head. So, keep in mind that the aim is not to master a
[00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:56.960]   technique like arcing or lab work with John Piper. That's not the aim. The aim is lifelong
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:04.240]   habits of mind and heart that humbly, eagerly ask and answer questions from the Bible.
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:09.200]   What a great little outline of how you attack a text, Pastor John. Thank you.
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:12.960]   And I hope that's helpful for you, Ryan, as you train your teenagers at home.
