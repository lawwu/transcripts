[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (gentle music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.440]   Elon's the iOS.
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.960]   By the way, he paved the way for all of us.
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.280]   - Right, it's the iOS, true.
[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.160]   - I would not be doing comma AI today
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.760]   if it was not for those conversations with Elon
[00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.440]   and if it were not for him saying,
[00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.640]   I think he said, "Well, obviously,
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:24.960]   "we're not gonna use LiDAR, we use cameras.
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.600]   "Humans use cameras."
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.560]   - So what do you think about that?
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.200]   How important is LiDAR?
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.280]   Everybody else on L5 is using LiDAR.
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.520]   What are your thoughts on his provocative statement
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.680]   that LiDAR is a crutch?
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.400]   - See, sometimes he'll say dumb things
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.400]   like the driver monitoring thing,
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.040]   but sometimes he'll say absolutely,
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.720]   completely, 100% obviously true things.
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.200]   Of course, LiDAR is a crutch.
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.360]   It's not even a good crutch.
[00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.200]   You're not even using it,
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.360]   oh, they're using it for localization,
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.500]   which isn't good in the first place.
[00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.840]   If you have to localize your car to centimeters
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:56.900]   in order to drive,
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.600]   yeah, they're not-- - That's not driving.
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.600]   - Currently not doing much machine learning
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.880]   on top of LiDAR data,
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.640]   meaning like to help you in the task of,
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.160]   general task of perception.
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.640]   - The main goal of those LiDARs on those cars,
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.160]   I think is actually localization more than perception,
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.400]   or at least that's what they use them for.
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.220]   - Yeah, that's true.
[00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.800]   - If you wanna localize to centimeters,
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.000]   you can't use GPS.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.440]   The fanciest GPS in the world can't do it,
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.240]   especially if you're under tree cover and stuff.
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.760]   With LiDAR, you can do this pretty easily.
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.520]   - So you really, they're not taking on,
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:26.680]   I mean, in some research,
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.080]   they're using it for perception,
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.120]   and they're certainly not, which is sad,
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.960]   they're not fusing it well with vision.
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.840]   - They do use it for perception.
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.680]   I'm not saying they don't use it for perception,
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.320]   but the thing that,
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.360]   they have vision-based and radar-based
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.960]   perception systems as well.
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.720]   You could remove the LiDAR
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.320]   and keep around a lot of the dynamic object perception.
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.600]   You wanna get centimeter accurate localization,
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.600]   good luck doing that with anything else.
