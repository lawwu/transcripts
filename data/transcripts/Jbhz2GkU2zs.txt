[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   [Music]
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.880]   Reckless Love. That's the mega hit worship song and its lyrics have reached
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.200]   millions and it's inspired over a dozen emails our way in just the past month
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.800]   like this one from Tim, a regular listener to the podcast. "Pastor John,
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.760]   hello. Over the past couple of months I've been hearing the song Reckless Love
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.840]   playing over and over in churches and on the radio. One of the main lines in the
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.440]   chorus celebrates the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God.
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.000]   My question is, is this a biblically and theologically correct way to describe
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.040]   God's love? Is the term reckless too reckless? I don't want to sound too
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.560]   judgmental but every time I bring this up I get called a Pharisee for focusing
[00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.480]   on just one word rather than the message of the whole song. Just hoping you could
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.000]   shed some light because I truly believe that words matter, especially in songs of
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.960]   worship and praise." My response to this concern needs to be
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.680]   expressed to two different groups of people, pastors and lead worshipers on
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.640]   the one hand, and I'm lumping those together as worship service shapers, and
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.960]   the congregation on the other hand. The shepherds who feed the flock with songs
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:28.160]   and the sheep who are asked to savor the truth and the music that they're being
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:34.160]   fed. I have two words for the pastors and lead worshipers and then something for
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:41.120]   the rest of us. First, we live in a time of unprecedented wealth of Christian
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:48.960]   music and there is no shortage whatsoever of older songs and newer songs
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:56.080]   and fresh renditions of older songs that are rock solid in their biblical content
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:02.240]   and creative and fresh and powerful both in their lyrics and in their tunes,
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:10.000]   which means that pastors and lead worshipers are never boxed in to using
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.040]   theologically defective or musically dated songs if you don't want to. If you
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:23.600]   want to be theologically and biblically faithful as a lead worshiper and feed
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:30.320]   your flock with the richest of biblical food and the most engaging of tunes,
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:36.320]   there is a wealth of old and new to choose from so that you never have to
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:42.640]   sing something theologically defective or misleading or unhelpful. The second
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.480]   thing I want to say to pastors and lead worshipers is that it is your primary
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:56.080]   responsibility to build into the minds and hearts of the people truth that
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.200]   portrays Christ and the Father and the Spirit and the way of salvation in
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:07.840]   biblically faithful ways so that the people's minds engage with spiritual
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:15.440]   reality, not just imaginary things, and so that people's hearts are moved toward
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:22.880]   authentic spiritual affections rooted in that reality. That's your job. Now, the
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:29.440]   congregation, a word to the congregation, the concern that Tim is raising for us
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:36.160]   here in this question that he asked, what does a congregation or an individual in
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:44.880]   the congregation do if a song is being sung that we think has defective lyrics?
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:51.920]   Especially if we think the song is theologically or biblically defective,
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:58.400]   not just poetically defective. And Tim gives us this specific example of a
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.840]   popular song right now called "Reckless Love." But there are many such problems
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:13.120]   in many songs, both old and new, not just new. So let me take this one for an
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:20.880]   example as to how we might respond when this happens. So "Reckless Love" has a
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:27.760]   refrain which ends like this, "Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:34.240]   of God." Now, I don't know enough about the theology of the author to know what
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:42.000]   aspect, what dimension of the meaning of "reckless" he intended. But I'm so aware
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.280]   that today there's a kind of theology that sees God as not knowing the future
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.120]   and therefore treating him as though he could take real risks since he doesn't
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:58.400]   know what might happen, in which case the giving of his son might be described as
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:04.800]   reckless. You might give your son and salvation not succeed. I mean, there are a
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.040]   lot of people who believe this, who believe that God doesn't know the future
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.400]   exhaustively and therefore he's taking real risks because he doesn't know what
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.760]   the outcome is going to be, at least not in the short run. So if "reckless" were to
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:25.680]   fit into that theology, I would regard it as heretical. Now, I hope the author did
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:31.520]   not intend it that way. In fact, it seems to me that there's good evidence in the
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:38.880]   song that he didn't mean it that way. But the reason the word "reckless"
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:45.600]   raises the question is because in modern English, you have to work really hard to
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.560]   put a positive meaning on the word "reckless" in relation to God. Because if
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:56.480]   you just click on a good thesaurus online and look at all the meanings
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:02.160]   associated with "reckless," here they areâ€”audacious, brash, carefree, careless,
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:08.000]   daring, foolhardy, hasty, ill-advised, imprudent, negligent, thoughtless,
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:14.400]   adventurous, any which way, breakneck, daredevil, desperate, devil may care,
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.800]   fast and loose, feckless, harebrained, headlong, heedless, helter-skelter,
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:23.600]   hopeless, hot-headed, inattentive, incautious, inconsiderate, indiscreet,
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:29.200]   kooky, madcap, mindless, overventuresome, playing with fire, precipitate, rash,
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:37.440]   regardless, temerious, uncareful, venturesome, venturous, wild. Now, that is
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:44.640]   the general sense that one gets when one hears the word "reckless driver,"
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:52.080]   uncaring about what other people do, or what he might do to other people. But
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:58.000]   maybe the author used the word "reckless" in the sense that God's love may
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.720]   look to an outsider, foolish and ill-advised, brash, breakneck, but in
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:10.880]   fact the foolishness of God is wiser than the wisdom of men, and the
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:15.360]   recklessness of God is more assured of success than the most carefully executed
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:20.240]   plan of man. Maybe. In other words, maybe he's treating the word "reckless" the
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:25.440]   way Jesus treated the word "hate" when he said, "You have to hate your mother
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:30.960]   and father in order to follow me." Well, it looks like hate to a lot of people
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:35.280]   when you follow Jesus and leave your mother and father behind. So what should
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:40.240]   you do sitting in the congregation if you don't like this word "reckless" and
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:45.520]   you have all these negative connotations in your head? One of the things you do is
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:52.240]   look at the lyrics of the song to see if there are evidences of how the word
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:58.880]   might be construed or intended. Here's a couple of examples. The song says,
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:06.400]   "Before I spoke a word, you were singing over me." Now in my mouth, those are
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:12.080]   radically Calvinistic lyrics. God only sings over his own people. He doesn't
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:15.920]   sing over those who are in rebellion against him. He sings over his own
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:22.960]   people, Zephaniah 3:17. So, if you are God's own people before you spoke a
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:29.360]   word, that's unconditional election. Here's another example. "Before I took a
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:36.000]   breath, you breathed your life into me." Now in my mouth, that's a radical
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   affirmation of Calvinistic doctrine of sovereign grace, irresistible grace.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.200]   Since the Bible doesn't teach that God breathed life into us before we were
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:53.360]   physically born, I take the words, "You breathed life into me," to be a reference
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:09:02.400]   to the new birth. So, the song is saying that the new birth happened to me before
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:08.880]   I took any breath at all, meaning before I did anything to signify that I had
[00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:13.840]   life, which is exactly what happens in the new birth. It is a sovereign gift of
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:19.040]   God. We don't make new birth happen. God makes new birth happen. Now, I don't
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:23.360]   know whether the author is that Calvinistic. I kind of have my doubts, but
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:28.560]   I don't know. But that's the way I would sing these words if we ever did sing it,
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:33.680]   because that's their most natural meaning, at least I hear them that way,
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:40.320]   which then means when I get to the word "reckless," I'm going to put a meaning on
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:47.440]   it that ascribes to God absolute control over the object and circumstances of His
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:54.480]   love, because that's what's implied in those previous lyrics. And I hope that
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:59.680]   those who love the word "reckless" in this song also love the Calvinistic
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:05.280]   theology in the rest of the lyrics. So, here's the point. If you're in a church
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:10.880]   that basically sings sound and helpful lyrics, and along comes a song with
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:17.040]   questionable words, then either stop singing if your conscience won't let you
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:26.720]   sing, or put a meaning on the words that you are able to affirm. Now, lest you
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:34.080]   think I'm asking you to do something quirky or unusual with new songs that we
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:41.840]   don't do with old songs, consider one last illustration. Most gospel-loving
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:49.680]   evangelical churches, including mine, the one I go to, love to sing Charles
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:56.720]   Wesley's "And Can It Be." Great song, right? Yeah. But what do you mean when you
[00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:02.320]   sing, "He left His Father's throne above, so free, so infinite is grace, emptied
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:07.760]   Himself of all but love"? Give me a break! He did not empty Himself of all but love.
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:13.040]   That is absolutely not true. He didn't empty Himself of righteousness and
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:20.640]   wisdom and justice and holiness and deity. Well, you can either protest the
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:26.280]   song to your worship leader and stop singing this Wesleyan song, or you can
[00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:34.720]   stop singing, or you do what I do. You can take it as poetic license for
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:40.680]   overstatement in a poem and construe it to mean, "He emptied Himself of everything
[00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:45.600]   He needed to empty Himself of in order to be as loving as He could be." Something
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:51.400]   like that. I don't think Charles Wesley was a heretic. Not like that, anyway. But
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:58.120]   take the next verse. Most Calvinists love to sing the next verse. Whoa, it sounds
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:03.680]   exactly like what we believe, right? "Sovereign, irresistible grace to the dead
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:09.960]   imprisoned sinner. Long my imprisoned spirit lay, fast bound in sin and nature's
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:16.880]   night," that's original sin, "thine eye diffused, a quickening, a life-giving ray.
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:25.280]   I woke, the dungeon flamed with light, my chains fell off, my heart was free. I rose,
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:31.600]   went forth and followed thee." When I sing that, I'm singing like a full-blooded
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:38.640]   seven-point Calvinist. "My chains fell off, my heart was free, I'm out of here
[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:44.360]   because of the sovereign grace of God and that only." Charles Wesley didn't mean
[00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:51.880]   that. Charles Wesley, being a good Wesleyan that he was, not a Calvinist,
[00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:58.680]   probably did not mean what I mean when I sing that verse. He meant that God's
[00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:06.840]   prevenient grace overcame original sin and struck off the chains of
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:14.960]   helplessness and put me in a position where I, with newly granted autonomous
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:22.840]   free will, may or may not leave the prison. My choice is final and decisive.
[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:31.160]   "I rose, went forth and followed thee." That's not what I mean when I sing that
[00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:38.760]   song. So back to the pastors and lead worshipers, please do your job and do not
[00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:46.200]   ask too much of us sheep as we sit here in this service. Give us songs whose
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:54.160]   original meaning we can joyfully affirm because they are fully biblical. Don't
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:14:03.200]   give us too many, just one or two, like maybe and can it be. Don't give us too
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:08.400]   many where we have to change the meaning in order to be faithful. Thank you, Pastor
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:13.160]   John. And this discussion reminds me of another popular episode that we recorded
[00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:16.280]   where we looked at the the lyrics of a Christian song titled "What a Beautiful
[00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:21.920]   Name." That was in an episode we titled "When Worship Lyrics Miss the Mark." That
[00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:26.720]   was episode number 1077. Check it out in the archive at

[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:05.320]   all the emails that we have for the words "anxiety" or "anxious." And those terms
[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:12.640]   appear in 620 emails. Incredible. To the struggle with anxiety we turn next when
[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:17.800]   we return on Monday. I'm your host, Tony Reinke, and on behalf of John Piper and
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:23.080]   all of us at Desiring God, have a wonderful extended Memorial Day weekend.
[00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:26.560]   And we'll see you back here next week.
