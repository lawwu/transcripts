[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.660]   - What does Bible counselor Ed Welch say to men
[00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.940]   who are addicted to pornography?
[00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:11.820]   A few years back I had a chance to sit down with him
[00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.100]   at CCEF, the Christian Counseling and Educational Foundation
[00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.460]   near Philadelphia.
[00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.520]   It was there that I asked Welch,
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.300]   the author of the book, "Addictions, A Banquet in the Grave."
[00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.300]   What does he say in counseling men
[00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.440]   who are addicted to pornography?
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.580]   - Some of the things I might say would be this.
[00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.140]   It's so sad, it's so sad.
[00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.860]   Because when we look at Genesis one through three,
[00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.100]   I think we could argue that to be human
[00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.020]   is to be able to say no to temptations.
[00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.380]   That is identified as the pinnacle of humanness.
[00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.940]   This is what distinguishes humanity.
[00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.420]   Temptations will be presented to us
[00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.560]   and we say no to temptations.
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.860]   So I'm speaking to a man
[00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.460]   who has lost a certain sense of humanity.
[00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.740]   There's a sadness in that.
[00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.800]   One of the questions I might ask would be,
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.920]   this is so sad because you must have forgotten
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.380]   or never known who Jesus really is.
[00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.540]   You must have forgotten that he is the King of Kings
[00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.940]   who knows all things and is in secret places.
[00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.460]   There is no place that is private that he can't see.
[00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.620]   And I guess what I'm saying is,
[00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.740]   if a person's spouse or pastor was by them all that day,
[00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.060]   the person wouldn't struggle with internet pornography.
[00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.360]   Given the right context, we can say no.
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.900]   If a person's boss is around them the entire day,
[00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.300]   they're gonna say no to alcohol
[00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.080]   if they struggle with alcohol.
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.740]   So you must have forgotten that our God is Emmanuel,
[00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.020]   God with us, who sees in the very best sense of the word.
[00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.260]   There is nothing that is dark to him.
[00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.220]   Perhaps you've forgotten that his commandments
[00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.820]   are not burdensome, that his commandments can be our delight
[00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.820]   and perhaps you've forgotten that he's interested in joy.
[00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.980]   And not simply joy, but this abundant joy.
[00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.360]   Perhaps you've forgotten these things.
[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.900]   So that would be a question that I would have.
[00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.460]   Perhaps the second thing I would ask is, how can I help?
[00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.940]   And I say that because I can think of dozens of ways
[00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.940]   to help, but I think one of the struggles I've had
[00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.660]   or problems I've noticed in my relationship with other men
[00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.900]   is I'm the one doing all the work.
[00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.700]   At some point, I say, okay, how about you?
[00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.220]   Do you want to change?
[00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.380]   Do you want to change?
[00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.140]   And if so, how can I help?
[00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.060]   I'll be willing to do anything.
[00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.220]   If it's in the middle of the night
[00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.060]   and they want me to be there to somehow stand
[00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.600]   between them and their temptation,
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.420]   I'd be delighted to do such a thing.
[00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.160]   But I want the plan to come from them.
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.620]   If they're saying I want help,
[00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.380]   but they can't identify the nature of the help,
[00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.740]   I think I would find myself saying, let's pray together.
[00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.620]   Let's pray together and allow the Spirit
[00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.580]   to give you a battle plan.
[00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.380]   Because if you don't have a battle plan,
[00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.580]   you haven't truly started on this road
[00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.980]   of desiring to hate this rather than to love it.
[00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.860]   - That was Ed Welch, Bible counselor at CCEF
[00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.140]   and the author of Addictions, A Banquet in the Grave.
[00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.980]   You can find out more about him and the CCEF at ccef.org.
[00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.640]   And of course, we have a number of episodes
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.380]   in the podcast archive dealing with pornography
[00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.700]   and how to fight it with the beauty of Jesus Christ.
[00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.460]   Go to desiringgod.org, click on more
[00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.320]   at the top of the screen, and then click
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.520]   on the Ask Pastor John podcast icon.
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.760]   Well, as Pastor John wraps up his book writing leave,
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.340]   we welcome in one more guest
[00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.820]   for three episodes on technology.
[00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.980]   And the perspective we get is from a historian
[00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.260]   who also specializes in spiritual development.
[00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.300]   It's a very unique perspective this man brings,
[00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.020]   and I'll ask him some questions related
[00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.560]   to digital communications technology,
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.060]   and particularly the distractions of Facebook
[00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.220]   and Twitter on the Christian life.
[00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.060]   That's tomorrow.
[00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.060]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.660]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.820]   (silence)
[00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.980]   (silence)
[00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.140]   (silence)
[00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:29.140]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
