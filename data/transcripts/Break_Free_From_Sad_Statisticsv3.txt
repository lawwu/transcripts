[00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:11.840]   law firm helping technology companies with their intellectual property, corporate matters,
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.920]   technology law transactions, and litigation since 2008.
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.280]   Hello, everybody.
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:28.080]   It's Sam and Sidney from the Financial Samurai podcast.
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.400]   In this episode, I want to talk about the sad fact that 80% to 90% of the time we spend
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:40.440]   with our children is over by the time they turn 19, and especially it's over if they
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.600]   plan to go to college because they end up going to college, finding a job in a different
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.640]   city and living their lives.
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:55.520]   To me, that sounds really, really sad, which is why in my newsletter, I talked about relocating
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:02.560]   to where they are because if at least if we're in the same time zone, the excuses of not
[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.340]   visiting each other go down.
[00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:10.420]   Right now, my parents are visiting from Hawaii and my sister and niece are visiting from
[00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:16.840]   New York City and those are far away places, five to five and a half hour flights one way.
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.920]   Therefore, it's hard to see each other.
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.200]   It really takes so much effort.
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:29.160]   So the idea of relocating to at least the same time zone, if not the same city, if not
[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:35.780]   on the same street, if not in the same building, sounds like a good idea to me.
[00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.520]   But I'm wondering for you, Sidney, is this something that sounds crazy and absurd to
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.240]   you as one newsletter reader mentioned?
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.720]   I don't think it sounds absurd.
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:54.000]   I think a lot depends on a parent's relationship with their child where both sides end up relocating
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.360]   to and if the parents have health issues at the time, there's so many different variables,
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.400]   but I don't think it's absurd.
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.040]   I don't think it's absurd at all.
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.080]   I think just like if you have a jar of cookies in front of you, you're going to end up eating
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.560]   more of them.
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.600]   If you have a jar not in your house, you're not going to eat any cookies.
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.520]   You're going to eat fewer cookies.
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:23.000]   So the idea of being closer to where our kids are as adults, maybe, is that creepy in America
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.640]   or is that kind of like, hey, you just want to be close to the people you care about the
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.640]   most?
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.400]   I think it depends on each family unit as well.
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:40.600]   I grew up in a small suburb in Virginia and when I went off to college, a lot of my classmates
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.640]   went to college in our town and when they graduated, they ended up finding jobs in the
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.640]   same town.
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.360]   So they ended up living their adult lives in the same place where they grew up and that
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.400]   was something that they were fine with or that's the path that they chose to take and
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.600]   that's great.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.960]   It wasn't the path that I wanted to take.
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.600]   I wanted to go on the complete opposite side of the country.
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.640]   I followed you.
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.760]   We grew roots in California and it's been great, but the relationship that I have with
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:18.980]   my parents is different than everybody else's and for us, it's worked out okay, but I think
[00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:24.160]   as parents, right now, we're really close with our children and we do have a dream of
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.320]   being closer to them when they're adults.
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.000]   So every generation is different.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.240]   Every family is different.
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:35.760]   I totally agree with that, but don't you think our relationships with our adult children
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.560]   will be closer if we actually see them more?
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.080]   Oh, of course.
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.360]   And so is it kind of a chicken or the egg?
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.360]   I don't really think so.
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.160]   I think it's â€“ if you want to not have that statistic regarding 80 to 90 percent of the
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.120]   time you spend with your children is over by the time they turn 19, then you've got
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.120]   to make an effort.
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.560]   You've got to be intentional just like if you want to achieve financial freedom sooner,
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.640]   then you've got to be intentional in trying to save more aggressively, work harder, have
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.040]   side jobs, read personal finance literature to figure it out.
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.560]   You can't just wing it on your way to financial independence or multimillionaire status because
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.920]   nothing is really given to you.
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:20.480]   I think one other perspective perhaps is when your children are going to college and graduating
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:27.480]   and finding work, maybe following them to their first job is maybe not the best timing.
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:34.160]   I think some parents may want their children to be a little more independent in the beginning
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.040]   initially so they don't have their parents too close to rely on.
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.960]   For example, they can't go to mom and dad on the weekend and say, "Hey, come on, mommy.
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.120]   Can you do my laundry?"
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.720]   Or mom, can you cook me food or whatever.
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.840]   If there's a little bit more of a distance initially, then your adult kids can â€“
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:52.840]   Gain more independence.
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.800]   Gain more independence, get used to paying their own rent, going to the grocery store,
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.880]   filling up their car with gas, yada, yada, yada.
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:01.880]   Adulting.
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:08.000]   Yeah, doing the adulting and then moving closer after you feel, "OK, I'm confident our
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.680]   kids are not going to be coming back and moving back in at home."
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:12.680]   Right.
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.600]   Yeah, letting them go, seeing if they fly.
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.760]   They might fall but they'll get back up and they'll try again.
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.720]   I know some people will be like, "Well, you guys sound â€“ well, maybe I sound like
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:30.120]   a helicopter parent where you're just always hovering, watching their every move."
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.880]   To an external extent, that's true.
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.640]   But if we â€“ let's say they go to New York City.
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.640]   I love New York City for six months of the year.
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:44.400]   How sweet would it be to rent a condo or maybe buy a great place in New York City and live
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.400]   there?
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.760]   Let's say we're on the Upper West Side and they're working downtown.
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.880]   It's like a 25-minute subway away.
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:56.120]   We don't have to see them but it would be nice to have the option to see them just like
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.120]   it would be nice for them to have the option to see us.
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.480]   Yeah, optionality is always great, isn't it?
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.480]   Yeah, what's wrong with optionality?
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:10.400]   So when the reader said I was being absurd for thinking about moving closer to my children,
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:17.760]   I actually think it's absurd to only spend 10% of the time remaining for the rest of
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:18.760]   our lives.
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.120]   That seems absurd to me.
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.080]   Another interesting thing that reader brought up was, "Well, what are we going to do if
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.720]   one child goes to New York City and one child goes to Hawaii?"
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.160]   I was thinking to myself, "That would be amazing.
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:36.680]   These are two of the favorite places in the world or at least in America, Hawaii during
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:41.360]   the winters, New York City during the spring and summer.
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:46.400]   What a life and what an opportunity to maybe invest in real estate and diversify the real
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.720]   estate portfolio as well and make these business expenses as well.
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:51.960]   Why not?
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:57.120]   See readers in New York City, maybe host a meetup at a bookstore, do a talk, go to a
[00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:03.000]   conference and then go to Hawaii and have another meetup and work on my tan and do some
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   serving.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.700]   I mean, what an adventure.
[00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:10.880]   When we're retired, and it's not just us, I think most people who are retired have more
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.640]   flexibility to relocate.
[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:19.000]   Right, or just go on more longer trips.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.560]   For example, one of my friends, her parents are coming to visit for an entire month.
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:32.160]   Maybe we don't end up living in the same zip code as our kids, but we could spend long
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.160]   trips nearby.
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.160]   A season.
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:42.360]   A season in Hawaii, a season in New York City, a season in San Francisco, a season in Amsterdam,
[00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:43.920]   a season in Paris.
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:44.920]   Amazing.
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:50.560]   I mean, these are the things I guess not everybody can do if you don't have the money.
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:56.280]   But hopefully, if you are able to save and invest aggressively for a long time, you will
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:01.720]   be able to generate some passive income and accumulate a high enough net worth and generate
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:05.640]   enough social security and other retirement income so you have more freedom.
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:09.420]   That's the whole point of financial independence.
[00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:15.760]   So based on the reader feedback, I am wondering if there is some type of mental block that
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:21.320]   some people just have where they cannot see beyond societal norms.
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:24.680]   They cannot draw beyond the lines.
[00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:29.960]   Do you believe people just have a harder time looking outside of societal norms?
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:31.760]   Some people for sure.
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.040]   And why do you think that is?
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:37.520]   Is it genetics, nature, parental upbringing?
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:43.640]   What's going on here where people can't try to do something more unique or think more
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:44.640]   creatively?
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.280]   I think it's all of those things and more.
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:48.960]   We each grow up in a different environment.
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:51.080]   We have different thought processes.
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:56.960]   We have different education, different cultures, different mindsets.
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:00.920]   Even within one family unit, you have so many different personalities, right?
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.960]   And we're all different people.
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:06.960]   We each have our own little realities and our own bubbles.
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:07.960]   Right.
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:14.000]   I hope the financial samurai story and other people's stories help motivate people to think
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.520]   a little bit differently.
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:19.340]   I was never really that creative of a person growing up.
[00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:23.040]   But over time, I thought to myself, "Why not try this way?
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.360]   Why not do this?
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:28.000]   Keep on ideating, trying new things."
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.280]   Even if you fail, it's like, "Okay, who can come up with the most number of failures?"
[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:36.200]   Because that just means you're that much closer to a solution.
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:41.400]   The classic example I've given over and over again is regarding negotiating a severance.
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:47.600]   To me, quitting a job after you've dedicated years of your life to an organization is nonsensical
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:48.600]   to me.
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:52.640]   Because if you quit, you don't get a severance package, you don't get subsidized healthcare,
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:55.400]   you don't get these referrals.
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:57.740]   It's a suboptimal financial move.
[00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:02.840]   But whether it's due to ignorance or fear of confrontation, people don't try to negotiate
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:03.840]   a severance.
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:08.080]   I've been speaking about this message since 2012 and I'll keep on speaking about this
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:15.080]   message to encourage people to fight for their rights as employees.
[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:20.580]   Because you will see if you work long enough that eventually, you're going to not get promoted.
[00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:23.120]   You're going to get discarded, you're going to get laid off.
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:26.560]   And you realize, "Wait a minute, maybe I'm just a number.
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:30.400]   I'll just get let go over text message, Slack, or email."
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:36.440]   That doesn't feel great and I want people to own their destiny to plan ahead and take
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:37.440]   action.
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:43.960]   So, Cindy, I know you have a more conservative personality, less risk-taking personality.
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:49.560]   But I want to ask you, what are some "absurd things" that you thought about as a child
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:54.160]   or as a young adult that ended up coming true?
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:57.400]   Nothing super crazy comes to the top of my mind.
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:04.480]   But one thing I could say is, I took my first trip out to San Francisco when I was middle
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:07.320]   school, early high school, sometime around then.
[00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:08.760]   And I fell in love with the city.
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:11.840]   I'd never seen anything like it before.
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:18.720]   And I grew up in a very non-diverse suburb that was completely landlocked.
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:25.560]   And when I came out here, I was just amazed by the diversity of the people, the variety
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:31.040]   of things to do in the city, and that it was in the middle of the bay with the ocean so
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:32.040]   close.
[00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:37.080]   And I thought, "Wow, how incredible would it be to be able to live and work in a city
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:40.120]   like this and see the ocean every day?"
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:47.480]   And I kind of put it out of my mind and went to college, time went by, and then was really
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:51.120]   lucky that we already knew each other and that you had moved out here.
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.600]   And I thought, "Why can't I move out to San Francisco?"
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:55.280]   I didn't even hesitate.
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:56.800]   I knew I wanted to come out here.
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:00.000]   I told my parents, "I'm going to be moving to San Francisco."
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.560]   And luckily, they didn't object at all.
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:07.800]   And I packed my bags, got on an airplane, had my one-way ticket, and I never looked
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.040]   back.
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:14.600]   And it was a dream that I never really expected to come to fruition, but it did.
[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:17.140]   And weren't you worried about the money at all?
[00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:18.560]   How were you going to pay the bills?
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:19.840]   How was I going to pay the bills?
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:24.320]   Well, I was already looking into job opportunities before I came out here.
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:25.920]   I had money saved up.
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:31.200]   I wasn't the type that was wasting my money on unnecessary things, so I had enough to
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.560]   get started.
[00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:37.840]   And I found a job within a month, I think, or maybe even less of when I moved out here.
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.040]   And then the rest is history.
[00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:42.320]   No, that's great.
[00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:44.360]   Manifesting what you want.
[00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:45.360]   You never know.
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:46.760]   Sometimes things could come true.
[00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:52.860]   What's wrong with thinking in extremes, having stretch goals, absurd dreams?
[00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:54.300]   Why not?
[00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:55.300]   Thinking is free.
[00:12:55.300 --> 00:13:00.340]   I remember when I was 23, I was thinking to myself, "Gosh, I hope I can get out of here
[00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:06.340]   by age 40, retire by 40, and just do my own thing because this Wall Street job is killing
[00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:07.340]   me."
[00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:11.260]   So 17, 18 years in the business, all right, that's enough.
[00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:17.380]   But because I had this goal at a very young age, I was able to get out at 34 because I
[00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:20.180]   figured out the way out with the severance package.
[00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:23.140]   It was the number one catalyst to get me out of there.
[00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:29.740]   And so the more intentional you are about thinking about things that might not be normal,
[00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:34.380]   I think the greater your chance of you achieving that one thing.
[00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:40.460]   And I will add to that also having a supportive partner or supportive family.
[00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:45.620]   We're lucky that we have a great friendship and that we share a lot of the same values,
[00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:46.620]   right?
[00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:52.700]   And I've been supportive of your idea since the beginning of changing your career path
[00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:54.140]   and becoming independent.
[00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:57.420]   And you obviously supported me in countless ways, right?
[00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:00.180]   I came out here because you were here.
[00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:05.820]   If I didn't know you, it's much, much less likely that I would have had the courage to
[00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:10.140]   fly all the way out here and start a life on my own.
[00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:14.020]   I was able to do that because you gave me the foundation.
[00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:15.660]   You were my support network.
[00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:16.660]   We worked it out together.
[00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:17.660]   Right.
[00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:19.980]   So having a partner makes a huge difference.
[00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:20.980]   Yeah.
[00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:26.240]   When I left at 34, I told Sydney, "If things work out for three years, you too can leave
[00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.240]   at 34."
[00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:32.720]   Well, I left two months before my 35th birthday, so by 35, and we'll go on this journey together.
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:34.740]   So you stayed at the steady job.
[00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:37.260]   You provided subsidized healthcare.
[00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:42.540]   At that time, your employer was providing 100% subsidized healthcare, remember?
[00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:45.420]   And that put a lot of relief.
[00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:46.900]   It gave me a lot of relief.
[00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:52.040]   And I got to think about financial samurai, do some consulting, just try out all these
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.220]   different things.
[00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:58.620]   And those three years when I didn't have the job for the first three years went by quick.
[00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:05.860]   And it was nice to have a solid supporting partner who had a day job and all the benefits
[00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:07.580]   of that, I didn't feel as stressed.
[00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:12.740]   Because if you decided, "Oh, I'm going to leave too right there," I'll be, "Oh, that'd
[00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:15.060]   be pretty risky."
[00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:20.580]   And this is honestly how I feel sometimes during bear markets, because we now haven't
[00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:26.940]   had a job in a while, eight years for you, 11 years for me.
[00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:30.820]   And so when there's a downturn that happens, it's more stressful.
[00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:34.860]   Because I think about all the progress that I lost financially because we're losing all
[00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:36.540]   this money, just like in 2022.
[00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:37.540]   Yeah.
[00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:44.500]   I was just going to add, at least we've diversified a lot more than the last 10, 20 years.
[00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:45.500]   Right.
[00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:46.500]   Compared to back in 2008.
[00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:54.260]   But you know, it's funny, in 2008, I was still very diversified, real estate, stocks, CDs,
[00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:55.260]   little bit of bonds.
[00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.860]   I mean, I still lost 35% of my net worth in about six months.
[00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:02.020]   This is in 2008, 2009.
[00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:08.660]   And that goes to show the magnitude of the decline back then and how dire things were.
[00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:10.540]   Nothing really has come close to back then.
[00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:13.420]   And I never want to go back to back then.
[00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:21.180]   So it's just another reminder, folks, review your portfolio, look at your exposure, make
[00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:24.980]   sure the exposure is congruent with your risk tolerance.
[00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:31.420]   I know Empower, if you link up over $100,000 in investable assets, you can have a free
[00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:36.820]   discussion with a registered financial advisor who has seen many, many portfolios before
[00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:40.500]   at your age and with your situation.
[00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:42.880]   So they can provide a good sounding board for you.

[00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:49.140]   Why not?
[00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:50.780]   I've done it before myself 10 years ago.
[00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:53.020]   It's good to get different perspectives.
[00:16:53.020 --> 00:17:00.660]   All of us have some sort of blind spot or some sort of portfolio "drift" where the percentage
[00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:04.900]   allocation is much greater than the intentional allocation.
[00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:10.460]   At any rate, I want to encourage everyone who's been told they've been absurd or they've
[00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:18.020]   had absurd dreams or they're crazy to know that it's okay because sometimes your absurd
[00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:20.020]   dreams do come true.
[00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:26.580]   And when they do come true, you're going to be so glad you didn't accept the status quo.
[00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:28.300]   Thank you everyone for listening.
