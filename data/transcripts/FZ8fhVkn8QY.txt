[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.220]   Listen, when the stock market falls, you don't run out of the store because stocks are unsealed.
[00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.560]   You run into the burning building and you buy.
[00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.980]   And more people have done that, I think, than ever before.
[00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:16.260]   And I think that's a great thing, but you do wonder if it makes it so these cycles just play out differently than it didn't pass.
[00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.200]   Yeah, and people are like, I don't want to invest because I could just wait for the next crash because they're happening so fast.
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:27.000]   Whereas I think earlier in my investing career, sure, when 2008 happened, I didn't have money to invest.
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.760]   But it wasn't a buying opportunity for me, but I didn't have this belief that there would be another one so soon.
[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.360]   I just slowly kept putting whatever I could in.
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:42.380]   And now a part of me is like, gosh, if these swings are so great, should I just be keeping every amount of savings on the sideline in cash?
[00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:49.880]   I just constantly time the short crashes, which just both feels like a good idea and also feels like a terrible idea at the same time.
