[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.600]   [music]
[00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.360]   Welcome to the Bogleheads Chapter Series.
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.000]   This episode was hosted by the Minnesota Bogleheads
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.160]   and recorded June 12th, 2021.
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.540]   It features Alan Roth and Mel Lindauer.
[00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.760]   The topic is Framing Financial Decisions
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.000]   and Bogleheads Philosophy.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.500]   Bogleheads are investors who follow
[00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.360]   John Bogle's investing philosophy
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.840]   for attaining financial independence.
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.560]   This recording is for informational purposes only
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.400]   and should not be construed as investment advice.
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.160]   Alan Roth and Mel Lindauer.
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.240]   So, Alan, he's the founder of WealthLogic.
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.800]   He's been working in the investment world
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.700]   for 25 years of corporate finance.
[00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.400]   He served as a corporate finance officer
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.360]   of two multibillion-dollar companies
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.660]   and consulted with many others.
[00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.300]   Alan has decades of experience in portfolio construction
[00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.800]   and performance benchmarking.
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.600]   He's appeared on numerous TV and radio shows,
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.300]   which I can attest to.
[00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.540]   Alan's everywhere, I think.
[00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.240]   You turn on a show, and, hey, there's Alan.
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.000]   He takes pride in being mocked on a semi-regular basis
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.200]   by some financial professionals for his hourly fee model
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.800]   and his obvious inability to make himself rich,
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.340]   kind of like Jag Bogle.
[00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.100]   He is also the author of "How a Second Grader
[00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.400]   Beats Wall Street."
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.940]   He writes for the AARP, "Wall Street Journal," and others.
[00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.800]   He's taught investments and behavioral finance
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.800]   at the University of Denver.
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:27.040]   Despite many of his credentials, CFP, CPA, MBA,
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.800]   he has earned that he has earned.
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.640]   He claims he can still keep investing simple.
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.100]   His professional goal is to never
[00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.700]   be confused with Jim Cramer.
[00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.340]   So that's Alan.
[00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.000]   And before we move on to Alan's thing, Mel Lindauer.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.840]   I call him the first bogal head, the first Vanguard diehard.
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:44.540]   Why is that?
[00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.040]   I think we have some questions where
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.100]   we'll dig into that history.
[00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.040]   For many of you that don't know, Mel was a marine.
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.440]   He spent a lot of time in the Marine Corps
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.940]   in the station out of Philadelphia.
[00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.640]   And that's where he remained after his discharge.
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.640]   At Jag Bogle's request, Mel founded and served
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.740]   as president of the John C. Bogle Center
[00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.340]   for Financial Literacy, from its founding way back in 2010
[00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.540]   until his resignation in 2019.
[00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.300]   Mel and his friend and co-author, Taylor Larimer,
[00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.140]   arranged the first get-together with Jag Bogle
[00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.240]   and about 20 folks down in Miami in 2000, 21 years ago.
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.440]   That was to be the first of the annual Bogleheads conferences.
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.340]   Mel also co-authored the two best-selling Boglehead books
[00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.040]   on investing, the former columnist for Forbes.com.
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.940]   He was a moderator and contributor
[00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.840]   at the original Morningstar diehard forum
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.440]   and now continues that as moderator and contributor
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.940]   at the Bogleheads.org forum.
[00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.600]   Money Magazine honored Mel as one of the money heroes
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.940]   for his work in investor education over the years.
[00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:48.500]   Wow.
[00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.540]   So these two guys, I'm going to shut up here
[00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:51.840]   so we can hear from these guys.
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.640]   So, Alan, take it away, please.
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:55.140]   Great.
[00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.640]   Thank you.
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:10.040]   Can you see the slide?
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:16.180]   Can you guys see the slide?
[00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.180]   Yeah, we sure can, Alan.
[00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.680]   Looks great.
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.180]   OK.
[00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.680]   Good.
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:19.880]   OK.
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.980]   Terrific.
[00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.880]   Well, first of all, thank you for having me.
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.200]   And to all of you out there, you do so much
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.080]   on the Bogleheads forum to help so many people everywhere.
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.040]   And that's a wonderful thing.
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.760]   So as a licensed financial planner,
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.000]   I've got to give a couple of legal disclosures.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.680]   Number one, I despise coming after Mike Piper.
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.360]   The guy is so darn good and gives away
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.460]   all of his brilliance without any incentive to make profit.
[00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:56.760]   Makes me look very bad.
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.100]   He used to live out here.
[00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.020]   I so miss him.
[00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.420]   And Mel, way to go, because I think
[00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.740]   you're the guy that discovered him and brought him
[00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:06.940]   into the Bogleheads.
[00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.180]   Second of all, as a licensed financial planner,
[00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.940]   I can exaggerate.
[00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.340]   So I owe my life to Jeff, who saved my life
[00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.380]   about a dozen years ago.
[00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.780]   When I wrote a column for Money Magazine called The Mole,
[00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.460]   it was kind of the hidden secrets.
[00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.260]   It was an anonymous column of the hidden secrets
[00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.100]   of the financial services industry.
[00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.940]   And I made a post that allowed people to track who I was.
[00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:41.220]   And Jeff protected my identity from the insurance world.
[00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.220]   So thank you.
[00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.060]   A little exaggeration.
[00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.700]   That's OK, sure.
[00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.020]   So I'm going to talk--
[00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.060]   a lot has changed since The Mole.
[00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.020]   Expenses have gone way down.
[00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.740]   There's now more money in US stock index funds
[00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.340]   than active funds.
[00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.940]   I mean, Jack Bogle and all of you really have succeeded.
[00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.980]   So I'm going to talk a little bit about a mole-like--
[00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:06.620]   still how my industry tends to frame things that
[00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.860]   may not be good for you.
[00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:13.020]   And two of the largest pet peeves that I have now
[00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.700]   are munis and mortgage.
[00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.900]   And I'm going to start with the mortgage.
[00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.500]   So number one, asset allocation.
[00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:21.820]   And here's an example.
[00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.980]   Let's say we have a person that has a half a million dollars
[00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.860]   in stocks, a half a million dollars in bonds,
[00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:34.940]   and a $400,000 house with a $200,000 mortgage.
[00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.660]   So the common framing, the way my industry
[00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.220]   would like it to be framed, is you
[00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:40.900]   have a million dollar portfolio.
[00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:46.900]   It's 50% stocks, 50% bonds, and $200,000 home equity.
[00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.340]   And I say, baloney.
[00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:53.340]   This person has an $800,000 portfolio
[00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:58.300]   that has $500,000 in stocks and $300,000 in bonds
[00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.700]   and a $400,000 home.
[00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:04.740]   Of course, both have the same net worth.
[00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.260]   And the reason why is that the mortgage is just
[00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.420]   the opposite of a bond.
[00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:14.060]   When you buy a bond or a bond fund, you're lending money.
[00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.620]   When you take a mortgage out, you're
[00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:19.860]   paying a bank principal and interest.
[00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:23.620]   So how you finance a house has no impact on the price
[00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.500]   you ultimately sell it for.
[00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:30.260]   And it turns out that borrowing money at 2 and 1/2%
[00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.100]   and lending it out at 1, 1 and 1/4%,
[00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:37.660]   it's not a great strategy, especially the new tax law
[00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:41.100]   makes it even less great, where people aren't getting much,
[00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.660]   if any, of a tax deduction for.
[00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:47.780]   But the fixed income, the bond fund, is typically taxable.
[00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:52.860]   And most of my industry wants you
[00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:54.900]   to compare that 2 and 1/2% mortgage
[00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:58.100]   to the overall return of the portfolio.
[00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:00.380]   If you think about it, planners that
[00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:04.100]   charge assets under management or commission, and banks,
[00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:06.740]   of course, they all make money from this.
[00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:11.540]   And whenever I write about this, I get lots of nasty emails.
[00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:14.340]   And my favorite one was only a baboon
[00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:15.740]   would do what I recommended.
[00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:17.300]   So I went back to him.
[00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.740]   I said, here's a deal.
[00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:23.820]   I'll lend you money at--
[00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.860]   or you lend me money at 1%.
[00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:27.620]   I'll lend it back to you at 2 and 1/2%.
[00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:31.020]   You can invest it in the market and pocket the difference.
[00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:33.060]   So it really is that simple.
[00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:36.940]   There's only one reason not to pay off your mortgage
[00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:41.740]   if you have high-quality fixed income paying less after taxes.
[00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:44.140]   And that's because you need it for liquidity
[00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:45.740]   to be able to sleep at night.
[00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:52.340]   Back to a cap-weighted index fund.
[00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:55.860]   The argument is, sure, what Jack created was great.
[00:07:55.860 --> 00:08:00.660]   But there's far more opportunities now.
[00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:02.420]   If you buy a cap-weighted index fund,
[00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:04.460]   you're guaranteed to underperform the market
[00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:07.260]   by the fees.
[00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:12.860]   You're just buying more of those overvalued large-cap growth
[00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:13.740]   companies.
[00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:16.420]   And look, since 1928, the data is
[00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:19.900]   compelling that small-cap value has trounced
[00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:21.820]   the cap-weighted portfolio.
[00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:25.500]   That's what many in my industry want you to believe.
[00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:29.420]   But a cap-weighted index fund must
[00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:33.780]   beat the average dollar invested in the market.
[00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:35.700]   It has to happen that way.
[00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:40.100]   Bill Sharpe's arithmetic of active investing shows that.
[00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:43.780]   It's second-grader math.
[00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:46.700]   Picking parts of the market or weighting differently,
[00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:49.140]   it is active investing.
[00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:53.860]   And then finally, I love it when I hear data since 1928, et
[00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:54.580]   cetera.
[00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:57.820]   Well, no one that I know has been investing in small-cap
[00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:00.100]   value since 1928.
[00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:04.780]   And by the way, it would have been outrageously expensive.
[00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:12.420]   So a lot of this smart beta is just trying to beat the market.
[00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:16.780]   What Jack Bogle created, a cap-weighted index mutual fund,
[00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:18.540]   is brilliant.
[00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:22.260]   Now, when I teach behavioral finance,
[00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.980]   I ask people to find patterns out of this.
[00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:28.060]   And people are pretty good at saying, hey,
[00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:30.820]   the right hemisphere is far more filled in.
[00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:34.020]   The bottom right is completely filled in.
[00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:35.460]   Column C is blank.
[00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:38.700]   Column D is all filled in, et cetera.
[00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:41.100]   And we're really good at finding patterns.
[00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:43.660]   This was just a random number generator
[00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:48.420]   where each cell had a 50% chance of being filled in.
[00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:52.300]   So how incredibly unusual would it
[00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:57.700]   be to find patterns over decades and decades
[00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:00.860]   with thousands of stocks, et cetera?
[00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:04.260]   So we now have more than 600 investing factors.
[00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260]   And all of these work brilliantly
[00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:10.020]   in the past, which would be a great strategy if any of us
[00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:12.500]   had a time machine.
[00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:15.580]   Mine doesn't work.
[00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:19.100]   So the term smart beta, you're finding some of these factors.
[00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:22.180]   And it turns out dumb beta wasn't so dumb.
[00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:25.420]   About six, seven years ago, I'd be at a conference, smart beta,
[00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:28.100]   factor tilting, free lunch, et cetera.
[00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:32.780]   And you can see how small cap in value
[00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:35.900]   drastically underperformed the market, and especially
[00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:38.060]   large cap growth.
[00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:41.380]   And the total dollar return is pretty amazing.
[00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:46.140]   It will take years and years and years for small cap value
[00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:47.300]   to catch up.
[00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:49.220]   Why?
[00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:50.740]   Things change.
[00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:54.940]   If we look at what were the 10 most valuable companies
[00:10:54.940 --> 00:11:01.700]   in the United States in 1980 and compare them to 40 years later,
[00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:03.380]   it's a different world.
[00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:05.380]   And we go back to 1900.
[00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:07.940]   The majority of the value of the US stock market
[00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:11.020]   was in the railroad industry.
[00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:12.420]   So things change.
[00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:15.780]   And finding patterns of what worked in the past
[00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:19.540]   is not the ticket to work going forward.
[00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:21.980]   And by the way, in 1981, I went to work
[00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:24.740]   for Exxon, number three, which later bought
[00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:28.860]   Mobil, number seven, and today is in the top 25 combined.
[00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:35.820]   And then drivers of stock market returns,
[00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:39.340]   why does market cap indexing work?
[00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:45.260]   If we look at what total stock market did last year,
[00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:49.460]   so it's the total return of the Vanguard total stock market,
[00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:51.700]   including dividend reinvestments,
[00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:55.220]   and compare it to the same smart value
[00:11:55.220 --> 00:12:00.580]   tilting of the same companies, that smart beta
[00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:03.620]   got less than half of the total return.
[00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:04.620]   Why?
[00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:06.780]   Because every year, there's a handful
[00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:11.380]   of companies that really drive the return of the total stock
[00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:12.220]   market.
[00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:18.260]   Last year, it was Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, et cetera.
[00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:21.100]   And again, if I knew what next year's would be,
[00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:25.780]   I would be having my own rocket ship company
[00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:32.180]   and going into space before Jeff Bezos.
[00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:36.380]   And we have an addiction to prediction.
[00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:40.060]   It's a human trait that we hate randomness.
[00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:43.180]   So we all have to get forecasts of what's
[00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:45.300]   going to outperform next year.
[00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:47.100]   And my friend, Christine Binns, does
[00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:51.940]   a great job of getting some of these forecasts together.
[00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:54.460]   And all of them, especially when you read the logic,
[00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:56.940]   are very, very compelling.
[00:12:56.940 --> 00:13:04.020]   And even Vanguard's estimate of future returns,
[00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:05.620]   and at least they do it better.
[00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:10.460]   They give a range, and they do it over a 10-year period.
[00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:14.380]   But if you look at what they are saying, US equity,
[00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:18.500]   and you compare it to the international equity,
[00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:23.140]   two bars above, they're saying international will outperform
[00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:25.460]   or is likely to outperform, which, by the way,
[00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:28.980]   I happen to agree with, not by the magnitude they're showing.
[00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:33.860]   But where I disagree with is if you look at the bar on the left,
[00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:36.900]   they're showing it has less downside risk.
[00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:40.380]   And again, if I knew how to get a greater return with less
[00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:45.180]   downside risk, I would be a billionaire.
[00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:48.020]   And then it's absolutely amazing to me
[00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:51.140]   when we look at these predictions
[00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:54.220]   that very, very few people go back and look
[00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:58.860]   at what their predictions were years earlier.
[00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:03.420]   And Jeremy Grantham, he paints a really compelling picture.
[00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:06.180]   And it's going to be pretty ugly for stocks, especially
[00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:07.300]   US stocks.
[00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:11.340]   But that's exactly what he said about seven years ago.
[00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:16.940]   So it's very difficult to accept that we don't know.
[00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:21.020]   But if you think about it, look at what happened last year.
[00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:22.460]   We had a pandemic.
[00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:24.820]   We had surging unemployment.
[00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:27.260]   We had plunging GDP.
[00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.020]   We had racial unrest.
[00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:33.580]   We had political discourse like I've never seen before.
[00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:38.700]   And the US stock market gained 21.03%.
[00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:44.140]   It really is hard to predict what's going to happen.
[00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:45.940]   Interest rates.
[00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:49.620]   I'll admit that I don't like interest rates right now.
[00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:51.900]   But they've been far worse.
[00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:54.540]   The common framing is they're an all-time low.
[00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:56.060]   They have to go up.
[00:14:56.060 --> 00:15:00.420]   It was once so easy to get income from bonds.
[00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:03.340]   And we've got to avoid bonds except for things
[00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:06.380]   like the ultra-short or floating rates.
[00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:08.020]   And there are better alternatives.
[00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:10.380]   This is how my industry likes to frame it.
[00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:13.900]   The ultra-short bond fund, which, by the way,
[00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:16.780]   Schwab had an ultra-short bond fund that completely
[00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:21.140]   blew up in 2009 during the financial crisis.
[00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:26.380]   Vanguard has one now that is yielding, I think, 0.45%
[00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:30.260]   and is in barely investment grade.
[00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.660]   High-yield bonds, a.k.a.
[00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:35.140]   junk or floating rates.
[00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:38.900]   All floating-rate bonds are junk bonds because guess what?
[00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:43.580]   Credit-quality companies don't need to issue variable debt.
[00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:45.980]   Dividend stocks, REITs.
[00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:46.540]   I love it.
[00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:47.980]   I keep hearing this commercial.
[00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:52.980]   NRIA, a safe 10% return.
[00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:55.420]   If it were so safe, don't you think pension plans
[00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:58.660]   would pour money in?
[00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:03.660]   Why would they be doing a zillion different advertisements
[00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:07.060]   for it, spending a lot of marketing money?
[00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:10.100]   Master limited partnerships, most annuities,
[00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:14.060]   individual bonds rather than bond funds.
[00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:16.940]   And these are things that I think are dangerous.
[00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:21.220]   The way I tend to look at bonds and interest rates
[00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:24.100]   is, first of all, they've been far worse.
[00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:26.460]   Go back to 1981.
[00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:28.020]   And I tell clients this.
[00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:30.020]   And I said, do you remember when you could earn,
[00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:35.300]   if they're this old, a 12% return on a CD or a treasure?
[00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:36.460]   And they smile.
[00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:38.420]   Then I say, think about it.
[00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:40.980]   You can put $100,000 in.
[00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:43.980]   You get $12,000 interest.
[00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:47.380]   A third of it went to the state and federal government in taxes.
[00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:50.420]   You're left with $8,000 or an 8% return.
[00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:53.740]   And inflation was about 14%.
[00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:57.820]   So you lost 6% of your spending power.
[00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:01.740]   The purpose of fixed income has never been income.
[00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:04.900]   The top economists have called the direction of interest rates
[00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:10.380]   correctly, meaning up or down 30% of the time
[00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:13.020]   over the last 50 years.
[00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:16.020]   So in other words, they've been wrong 70%
[00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:21.780]   even though they had a 50% chance of getting it right.
[00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:23.740]   And I could explain why that happens.
[00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:25.140]   I mean, it's absurd.
[00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:27.860]   If we all knew that interest rates were going to go up,
[00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:30.700]   then when the Treasury has its auction next week,
[00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:32.980]   we would bid less to get a greater return.
[00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:35.900]   And rates already would have gone up.
[00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:38.540]   Now, there are some better ways to earn more.
[00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:43.580]   A lot of 401(k), 403(b) plans had negotiated contract
[00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:45.740]   with insurance companies that they never
[00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:49.140]   dreamed rates would be this low that are still
[00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:50.260]   paying pretty high.
[00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:56.380]   TIAA, on their annuity contract, on a lot of these 403(b)s,
[00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:58.700]   you've got to read all the fine print.
[00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:02.980]   But they have a minimum guaranteed 3%.
[00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:06.660]   The Thrift Savings Plan, the G Fund yielding about 1
[00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:10.100]   and 5/8, I wish I had direct--
[00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:12.220]   I wish I had access to that.
[00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:14.020]   Direct CDs can pay more.
[00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:17.460]   Insured Savings Account, I still have, believe it or not,
[00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:24.340]   a savings account that's yielding 1% and CUA insured
[00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:27.300]   versus what Vanguard or Fidelity or any brokerage are paying,
[00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:29.460]   0.01%.
[00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:32.900]   And then finally, like I said, paying down the mortgage
[00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:35.900]   because the mortgage is the inverse of a bond.
[00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:42.340]   Next, insurance and inertia.
[00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:44.380]   You probably heard the saying--
[00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:47.100]   in fact, it was in my book and probably wrong--
[00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:49.380]   that Albert Einstein said the power of compounding
[00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:52.180]   is the most powerful force in the universe.
[00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:53.940]   Jason Zweig has educated me.
[00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:59.100]   We don't know for sure, but he probably never said that.
[00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:03.300]   So I call inertia the most powerful force
[00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:04.700]   in the universe.
[00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:07.300]   So when it comes to insurance, the industry
[00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:09.580]   likes to say, protect yourself and your family
[00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:10.940]   no matter what.
[00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:14.060]   Buy as much insurance as you want.
[00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:15.420]   I love this one.
[00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:17.100]   If you love your family, you're going
[00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:20.460]   to buy permanent insurance rather than temporary term
[00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:24.940]   insurance because 99% of term policies
[00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:28.180]   will never pay out a dime.
[00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:29.820]   And of course, you insure your house.
[00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:32.380]   Why not insure your portfolio--
[00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:37.780]   spherical annuity, universal life, et cetera?
[00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:40.860]   Now, I say baloney.
[00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:44.260]   Number one, insurance companies are for profit.
[00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:46.900]   Even not-for-profit insurance companies,
[00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:51.380]   mutuals, have to make a profit.
[00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:56.540]   So you insure yourself for only what you cannot afford to lose.
[00:19:56.540 --> 00:20:01.860]   So as wealth grows, most insurance needs dissipate.
[00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:04.100]   I have no insurance on my cars, no--
[00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:06.860]   I'm sorry-- collision or comprehensive.
[00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:10.420]   I have liability and umbrella.
[00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:14.340]   And then permanent insurance, it's an indirect investment
[00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:15.820]   if you think about it.
[00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:21.140]   If you buy a whole life policy from Northwestern Life,
[00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:25.420]   look up Northwestern Life, what their balance sheet is in,
[00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:28.900]   and you're going to see that they're roughly 85% to 90%
[00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:30.340]   in fixed income.
[00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:31.740]   So you're going to get the return
[00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:34.860]   that you could have gotten had you invested it directly
[00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:39.420]   minus the commission's expenses and profits.
[00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:42.700]   The economics of term versus disability,
[00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:44.620]   both are very important.
[00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:49.260]   But if you think about it, if you buy a 30-year term policy,
[00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:54.220]   you get the best deal over the last few years of that policy
[00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:56.420]   because your likelihood of passing away
[00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:58.500]   increases as we age.
[00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:01.820]   Disability is just the opposite.
[00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:05.660]   We typically buy it when we're younger,
[00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:08.260]   and it pays out to age 65.
[00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:13.020]   So every year that you have it, your potential benefit from it
[00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:14.380]   gets less and less.
[00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:18.100]   I'll have doctors at 63, sometimes 64 years old,
[00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:19.940]   and they're still paying the premium, which
[00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:22.180]   has not gone down.
[00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:24.340]   And of course, yes, you insure your house,
[00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:26.740]   but you don't insure your house for a decline in value.
[00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:33.220]   All right, I said I had two main pet peeves.
[00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:34.420]   We talked about mortgage.
[00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:35.900]   The other are munis.
[00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:40.020]   And by the way, I own some of the Vanguard Intermediate Muni
[00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:42.100]   Bond Fund.
[00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:43.900]   So I'm not totally against munis,
[00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:46.540]   but I'm against putting a whole lot in munis.
[00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:49.940]   And I'm absolutely against the way my industry, even Vanguard,
[00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:54.820]   I hate to say it, will show the return of a muni bond.
[00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:59.660]   So the common frame is munis provide a safe tax-free return
[00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:00.860]   during Great Depression.
[00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:03.940]   The loss of muni bonds is only 0.5%.
[00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:07.100]   Munis are an inefficient market, where
[00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:10.700]   buying the bonds themselves yields more than twice
[00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:14.820]   what you could get on a Vanguard Muni Bond Fund.
[00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:18.860]   And then a recent portfolio was yielding over 5%
[00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:20.660]   federally tax-free.
[00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:22.060]   What's wrong with all that?
[00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:24.940]   Just about everything.
[00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:29.540]   Number one, munis, depending upon the type of calculation,
[00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:33.460]   whether you want to assume la-la land returns
[00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:36.740]   of these pensions or more realistic returns,
[00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:38.580]   they have about $2 to $6 trillion
[00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:43.260]   with a fund-funded pension and health care liabilities.
[00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:46.980]   Most companies got rid of defined benefit plans
[00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:50.500]   in favor of defined contribution, 401(k),
[00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:56.900]   403(b) type of plans, but not so for state and local
[00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:58.420]   governments.
[00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:01.580]   So munis could have a new correlation to stocks,
[00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:05.620]   so that if stocks don't do very, very well over the next 10
[00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:09.220]   years, as the baby boomers have retired
[00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:10.860]   and those payments are going out,
[00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:13.580]   there could be a lot of stress on those munis.
[00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:15.500]   It's possible the government bails them out,
[00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:18.580]   but that's a lot of money.
[00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:27.980]   And then finally, when it comes to looking at the--
[00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:39.220]   sorry, the amount of people that have retired,
[00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:42.700]   there weren't these baby boomers that had retired back
[00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:44.340]   during the Great Depression.
[00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:47.260]   And then framing the return on principle,
[00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:50.620]   it should be completely illegal.
[00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:52.340]   So here's the way the trick works.
[00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:55.140]   And I've actually met with the executive director and all
[00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:59.340]   of her senior staff on this, who are really nice people.
[00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:03.900]   But I think what's going on is just tricking people.
[00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:06.700]   So I buy a bond.
[00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:07.900]   I sell you a bond.
[00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:10.260]   It has a $5 coupon.
[00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:13.660]   And we buy it for $112 a piece.
[00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:17.820]   So the yield is 4.46%.
[00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:20.900]   Now, this bond is going to mature or be called in three
[00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:24.460]   years at $100.
[00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:29.420]   So roughly that $12 divided by the three years,
[00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:35.940]   roughly $4 of that $5 is just return of your own principle.
[00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:40.580]   Your statement is going to show that as income.
[00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:44.460]   So the actual yield is 0.89%.
[00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:48.140]   And of course, me as your advisor
[00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:50.020]   who's building this bond portfolio,
[00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:53.420]   I may charge you 0.5% or 1% of that.
[00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:58.420]   So your actual nominal yield may be negative.
[00:24:58.420 --> 00:24:59.700]   And am I exaggerating?
[00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:04.220]   I just looked at a portfolio that
[00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:08.380]   had an average coupon of a little over 5%.
[00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:12.740]   The yield to worst, which is really the best case scenario,
[00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:14.620]   the yield to worst is a calculation
[00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:17.260]   of if the bond is called.
[00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:19.580]   And why it's a best case scenario
[00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:22.100]   is that if interest rates do go up,
[00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:23.780]   those bonds aren't going to be called
[00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:27.900]   and you're going to be stuck earning a lower than market
[00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:28.700]   rate.
[00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:32.940]   So the manager fee was 0.35% of the net yield of this client
[00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:35.900]   was 0.05%.
[00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:42.460]   In addition, spreads can easily be over 1% on a muni.
[00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:46.700]   So the stocks, there are national markets and such
[00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:50.500]   where they trade, but not so in the bond market.
[00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:53.420]   And munis can have that 1% spread.
[00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:55.460]   The largest spread I've ever seen,
[00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:59.420]   which you can't actually see until the bond is closed,
[00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:04.940]   the client came to me, had a 10.25% spread on a bond
[00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:05.980]   he had bought.
[00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:09.620]   And by the way, that client was a very senior attorney
[00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:13.580]   with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
[00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:15.260]   had no clue this was going on.
[00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:21.580]   What to do with the expensive bond fund.
[00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:24.700]   I'm not going to go through the expensive dog fund.
[00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:30.380]   You have to do a calculation of what the tax consequences are
[00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:33.540]   to getting out versus what the tax consequences are
[00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:34.300]   to staying in.
[00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:39.780]   Because they may be doing a lot of trading and the like.
[00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:41.860]   You have to look at what the life
[00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:44.260]   expectancy of the person is.
[00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:46.860]   Will the step-up basis still be there?
[00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:52.100]   But it's a fairly complex analysis.
[00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:54.260]   And usually, when I look at a portfolio,
[00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:58.260]   it's not a let's get out of everything.
[00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:01.860]   It's a what to get out of, what to stay in.
[00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:05.540]   And when you have an expensive dog fund, for gosh sakes,
[00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:08.660]   don't let dividend reinvestments keep going.
[00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:12.980]   You're just buying more of that same fund.
[00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:17.140]   A financial advisor, I'm a certified financial planner.
[00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:19.900]   You should stick with me because I'm a fiduciary.
[00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:26.020]   I'm legally obligated to put your interests ahead of mine.
[00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:30.380]   The CFP board enforces a higher standard.
[00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:31.900]   I'm thoroughly vetted.
[00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:37.180]   And look for advisors who have been publicly recognized.
[00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:39.140]   That's the pitch.
[00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:44.100]   The reality is the fiduciary standard isn't enforced.
[00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:47.620]   It isn't enforced by the SEC, state regulators,
[00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:49.620]   and the CFP board.
[00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:54.140]   For many years, I've given data to Kevin Keller, who
[00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:56.980]   is the CEO of the CFP board, showing
[00:27:56.980 --> 00:28:00.140]   that the only actions that they take
[00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:07.820]   come after that of other clients, other regulators.
[00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:10.020]   I once helped a client file a complaint
[00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:17.060]   on a double dipping where the CFP with fiduciary duty
[00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:21.540]   could make up his mind whether to charge a commission
[00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:23.380]   or percentage of assets going on.
[00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:25.580]   So he did both.
[00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:29.060]   The total fees were 5.29%.
[00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:32.100]   CFP board, first they lost the complaint,
[00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:38.020]   and then they ultimately found no wrongdoing.
[00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:42.260]   Jason Zweig, I don't know if you read some of his columns
[00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:46.900]   a couple of years ago, exposing hypocrisy of people
[00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:55.540]   that have had huge CFPs, that have had huge findings by FINRA
[00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:58.780]   and the like, but have completely clean records
[00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:02.380]   on the Let's Make a Plan CFP website.
[00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:05.700]   And some of these prestigious awards,
[00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:08.380]   I thought were for sale for any person,
[00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:13.620]   but it turns out you don't have to be a person.
[00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:17.780]   So in my office is a beautiful plaque
[00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:21.380]   of one of America's top financial planners.
[00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:24.100]   And the Consumers Research Council of America's
[00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:27.820]   prestigious address is Pennsylvania Avenue
[00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:30.820]   on Washington, Washington, DC.
[00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:36.540]   Only I got it for my dog, Max Tailwagger.
[00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:41.540]   And he also, I sent in an application for him
[00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:46.220]   to be one of America's top financial planners for doctors,
[00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:48.100]   which he was also approved for.
[00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:51.060]   And I was too cheap to spend the money on that.
[00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:53.860]   I deeply regret that decision.
[00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:56.500]   Poor Max, he passed away about a month ago.
[00:29:56.500 --> 00:30:02.260]   All right, next, Social Security.
[00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:04.740]   And by the way, I presented this slide at the White Coat
[00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:08.500]   Investor last month, or last March,
[00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:12.660]   with Mike Piper standing just a few feet from me.
[00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:13.940]   But he's actually OK with this.
[00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:20.460]   Let me explain why I took Social Security at age 62.
[00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:22.940]   Which Mike Piper and most people would
[00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:24.940]   say that was a wrong thing to do.
[00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:28.100]   But I only did it in my mind.
[00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:34.700]   So mentally, I'm receiving $2,400 a month.
[00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:39.180]   And what I'm really doing is buying an inflation-adjusted
[00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:44.900]   deferred annuity at a 40% discount
[00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:47.380]   over what you could have bought it from an insurance
[00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:49.420]   company a few years ago.
[00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:51.860]   Now the insurance companies aren't even
[00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:55.380]   offering that inflation-adjusted annuity.
[00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:55.900]   Why?
[00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:59.380]   Because the actuaries are way too afraid of inflation,
[00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:03.220]   and there's no way to hedge that.
[00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:06.540]   But what I tell clients, that it's OK to spend that money
[00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:07.900]   if they needed it.
[00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:09.500]   Take it out of their own portfolio,
[00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:11.540]   because what they're really doing
[00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:15.140]   is buying that inflation-adjusted,
[00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:21.100]   government-protected annuity.
[00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:25.260]   So the best Social Security calculator, by far,
[00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:30.700]   comes from that guy that makes me look bad, Mike Piper.
[00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:32.380]   It's absolutely brilliant.
[00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:35.740]   Having been an officer for a couple of insurance companies,
[00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:38.020]   he doesn't just assume that we're
[00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:39.420]   going to die in a certain year.
[00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:44.540]   That a 63-year-old male is going to live 26 years, whatever.
[00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:47.220]   He's doing what an actuary would do,
[00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:51.340]   looking at the probabilities of passing away each year.
[00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:53.020]   And he gives this away.
[00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:58.380]   It's just absolutely-- it's a brilliant calculator.
[00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:00.700]   Tax strategies when you retire--
[00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:05.460]   again, it's ironic that a very young guy, Mike Piper,
[00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:09.100]   really is the world's leading expert on some of this.
[00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:11.220]   But there's tax gain harvesting.
[00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:18.380]   You can take capital gains at a 0% tax bracket
[00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:20.980]   when your income is low and you're delaying Social Security
[00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:23.740]   before the RMD.
[00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:25.740]   And that's just tax gain harvesting.
[00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:28.300]   And you don't have to wait 31 days, by the way.
[00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:33.300]   Only for tax-- there's a tax loss wash sale, not a tax gain
[00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:35.420]   wash sale.
[00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:38.100]   Partial Roth conversions.
[00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:41.820]   Certainly, if you're at a low tax bracket,
[00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:47.300]   I think, in general, try to use up that 12% marginal federal
[00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:49.060]   tax bracket.
[00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:54.900]   Tax deferred withdrawals managing to marginal tax rates.
[00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:57.220]   Again, that 12%.
[00:32:57.220 --> 00:32:59.820]   Roth conversions.
[00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:01.180]   Yes, I invented the Roth.
[00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:02.500]   And if anyone believes that, I've
[00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:05.340]   got some oceanfront property in Minnesota.
[00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:09.220]   Well, you do have 10,000 lakes.
[00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:14.020]   But anyways, I'm a believer in tax diversification.
[00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:16.140]   You can never predict what Congress is going to do.
[00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:19.860]   That's harder than predicting the market.
[00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:25.540]   So a Roth conversion for tax diversification,
[00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:27.020]   what's the size of your Roth money
[00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:30.020]   compared to your tax deferred and taxable money?
[00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:35.260]   Is the current marginal tax bracket low?
[00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:37.300]   The higher your income in retirement,
[00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:41.500]   the less attractive it is to do the conversions.
[00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:46.820]   The more burdensome of the RMDs, the greater the argument
[00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:49.940]   to do a Roth.
[00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:53.540]   And then you really should have some after-tax money
[00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:57.260]   to pay the taxes on the conversion.
[00:33:57.260 --> 00:33:59.180]   Before 59 and 1/2, you'd actually
[00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:05.220]   be hit with a penalty if you paid for it with the IRA money.
[00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:07.620]   You've got to look at whether your state has a tax
[00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:09.220]   exemption.
[00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:15.100]   For very wealthy people, there can be some estate tax planning
[00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:17.540]   benefits to do the conversion.
[00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:19.980]   Now, one of the things I don't have to consider
[00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:21.940]   is what we think Congress is going to do,
[00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:28.820]   because that's unpredictable, in my opinion.
[00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:32.980]   Financial wealth, the common framing
[00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:38.580]   is we measure net worth, at least in the US, in dollars.
[00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:41.980]   So someone with-- if I have $10 million
[00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:46.340]   and you only have $1 million, I would be 10 times richer
[00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:48.620]   than you.
[00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:51.180]   And of course, there's no quick way to get rich.
[00:34:51.180 --> 00:34:54.660]   And I think all of that is wrong.
[00:34:54.660 --> 00:34:59.500]   I would measure your net worth in years.
[00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:03.340]   So it's your total net worth divided by how much a year
[00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:05.900]   you need to support your life.
[00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:08.420]   So who's richer?
[00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:13.220]   I have $10 million, but I have a very wealthy lifestyle.
[00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:19.220]   I need $5 million a year to support my lifestyle.
[00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:22.660]   I've got two years worth of financial freedom.
[00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:24.940]   You're only worth a million dollars,
[00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:29.060]   but you can be happy with $50,000 a year.
[00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:31.700]   You have 20 years worth of financial freedom,
[00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:33.780]   because we can't take it with us.
[00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:35.900]   You're 10 times wealthier than me,
[00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:38.500]   and probably 100 times happier, by the way,
[00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:43.700]   if I needed $5 million a year to support my lifestyle.
[00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:48.940]   And you really can get rich quickly by cutting down
[00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:51.900]   what you're spending.
[00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:56.820]   Now, all sorts of frugal strategies are out there.
[00:35:56.820 --> 00:35:59.900]   And things like the Starbucks factor,
[00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:04.540]   not buying as much pop, those are things
[00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:08.340]   that can cut down expenditures.
[00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:13.380]   But the gorilla in the room is really the car.
[00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:14.460]   And I'm going to brag.
[00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:17.020]   I've been driving millionaire cars all my life.
[00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:24.500]   My last car was a Pontiac Grand Prix
[00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:28.260]   that I bought mostly with GM credit card points.
[00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:31.660]   My current car is an eight-year-old Chevy Volt,
[00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:36.260]   getting well over 250 miles per gallon,
[00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:40.540]   running mostly on electricity.
[00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:45.740]   But I pride myself on having the worst car in the neighborhood.
[00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:49.300]   The goal is not to look good.
[00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:51.020]   The goal of a car, in my opinion,
[00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:53.420]   is to be safe and get you from A to B.
[00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:57.220]   And my Chevy Volt gets me from A to B,
[00:36:57.220 --> 00:37:01.980]   maybe eight seconds less than the Lamborghini.
[00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:04.340]   So finally, money and happiness.
[00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:09.540]   If you think about it, as Bill Bernstein says,
[00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:11.180]   when you've won the game, quit playing.
[00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:14.300]   And he doesn't mean get out of stocks completely.
[00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:18.180]   He just means take risk off the table.
[00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:24.100]   So, you know, if somebody is close to winning the game,
[00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:27.700]   if their money goes up by 70%,
[00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:30.220]   they're going to be marginally happier.
[00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:32.820]   If Jeff Bezos makes another billion dollars,
[00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:34.020]   I'm sure he'll smile,
[00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:37.700]   but it's not going to change his lifestyle.
[00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:43.700]   But losing money causes a lot of unhappiness.
[00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:46.780]   And, you know, we take these risk profile questionnaires.
[00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:51.380]   I think they're worse than worthless.
[00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:53.540]   You know, we've really got to think about,
[00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:57.260]   I'm sorry the market didn't perform as we thought.
[00:37:57.260 --> 00:37:58.980]   You can't buy that vacation house.
[00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:01.820]   You can't send your kids to college,
[00:38:01.820 --> 00:38:05.460]   the expense of college, et cetera.
[00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:07.580]   Second, greater portfolio.
[00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:13.260]   Again, that's the same as Taylor's three-fund portfolio.
[00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:16.780]   The aggressive is 90% stocks,
[00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:21.220]   moderate 60% stocks and conservative 30% stocks.
[00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:26.180]   They all performed roughly the same over this period.
[00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:30.780]   But yet we as investors, even bogal heads, by the way,
[00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:33.900]   are predictably irrational.
[00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:38.580]   And I had several bogal heads call me up in March of last year.
[00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:40.780]   This time really is different.
[00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:42.940]   We've never had a pandemic before.
[00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:45.540]   One sold millions and millions of dollars in stocks
[00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:48.100]   just at the wrong time.
[00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:51.220]   So, you know, buy and hold is good,
[00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:55.900]   but buy, hold and rebalance is better.
[00:38:55.900 --> 00:39:00.340]   And our human nature is probably not likely
[00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:04.220]   to change significantly going forward.
[00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:07.500]   So I'm a believer in setting that asset allocation
[00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:10.460]   and sticking with it no matter what,
[00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:14.860]   which the book "Noise" is brilliant.
[00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:18.140]   And, you know, a computer-generated
[00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:21.700]   asset allocation, a robo-advisor,
[00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:23.620]   didn't know the pandemic was going on
[00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:26.740]   and did all the right things.
[00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:31.220]   So that's what I have for you guys.
[00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:32.940]   -Wonderful. Thank you, Alan.
[00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:36.660]   If there's questions, I did see a few came in.
[00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:38.300]   Feel free to chat them.
[00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:40.940]   We are monitoring the chat.
[00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:43.420]   Meanwhile, I'm going to switch gears here a little bit
[00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:46.100]   and switch back to Mel.
[00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:48.980]   Mel, I call him the first bogal head,
[00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:50.540]   but I should probably call him the first
[00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:52.860]   or second bogal head based on who I just saw
[00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:54.460]   come into the chat room here.
[00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:57.780]   So, Mel, can you give us some history lessons
[00:39:57.780 --> 00:40:01.020]   on the diehards, how that came into being,
[00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:03.380]   the move to bogal heads?
[00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:06.900]   How did we get 100 people here from across the country?
[00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:11.620]   -Mel, calling yourself "bogal heads."
[00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:13.220]   Oh, you're muted, Mel.
[00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:19.460]   I don't know if, Diane, if you could unmute him.
[00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:29.780]   -Actually, I'm not sure who created the phrase "bogal heads,"
[00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:34.300]   but initially it was a derogatory term.
[00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:35.540]   -Really? -Yeah.
[00:40:35.540 --> 00:40:39.620]   There was no diehard or bogal head forum,
[00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:43.500]   Morningstar, initially, back in 1998.
[00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:50.060]   And the bogal heads who were posting
[00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:55.820]   were considered outlaws or bad guys or whatever
[00:40:55.820 --> 00:40:57.940]   from the other people who were trying to figure out
[00:40:57.940 --> 00:41:01.140]   all the ways to beat the market and so forth.
[00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:07.980]   So, the bogal heads were asking for their own forum,
[00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:13.620]   and Morningstar finally relented and created it.
[00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:16.700]   But they were afraid to use the term "bogal heads"
[00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:17.900]   and to call us "bogal heads"
[00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:21.540]   because it was used as a derogatory term.
[00:41:21.540 --> 00:41:25.900]   So, instead, they called us the Vanguard Diehards
[00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:29.580]   because we wouldn't give up asking for our own forum.
[00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:35.500]   And they put a subtitle on the forum,
[00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:37.060]   which was "Bogal Heads Unite,
[00:41:37.060 --> 00:41:41.540]   Talk About Your Favorite Fun Company."
[00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:45.180]   So, that was their way of calling us bogal heads
[00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:48.540]   but not making it really a bogal heads forum.
[00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:52.100]   So, it was called the Vanguard Diehards because of that,
[00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:54.140]   and it stayed that way all the time
[00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:57.540]   that we were on Morningstar.
[00:41:57.540 --> 00:42:00.100]   They were deathly afraid that Jack would be upset
[00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:03.140]   by the term "bogal heads" too because, again,
[00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:05.820]   it was used as a derogatory term.
[00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:09.900]   And Jack and other Vanguard people
[00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:13.300]   used to monitor our forum from time to time.
[00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:15.540]   So, they knew Jack would see that.
[00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:19.540]   So, therefore, that's how we became the Vanguard Diehards.
[00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:21.420]   -Yeah, okay. When was that?
[00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:24.380]   Was that about '98, '97, do you remember?
[00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:28.620]   -1998. What was that? 20-something years ago.
[00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:30.860]   -Yeah, 23 years ago. Well.
[00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:33.860]   So, then the move to bogalheads.org
[00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:37.220]   happened probably right around the early 2000s?
[00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:39.780]   -2007. -Okay.
[00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:44.220]   -Again, that was a real fluke.
[00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:49.580]   Morningstar's software was really out of date,
[00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:55.940]   and we kept asking for them to update the forum software.
[00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:59.700]   And they kept saying they were going to do it,
[00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:00.620]   but they never did.
[00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:02.580]   They just dragged their feet.
[00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:09.180]   So, one of the bogalheads, as a joke, set up bogalheads.org --
[00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:11.620]   the forum, what's now bogalheads.org --
[00:43:11.620 --> 00:43:14.260]   set it up as a joke to show Morningstar,
[00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:15.900]   "This isn't rocket science.
[00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:18.860]   I can do it for nothing in five minutes."
[00:43:18.860 --> 00:43:22.540]   So, he set up this dummy forum,
[00:43:22.540 --> 00:43:26.380]   and all of a sudden, a couple of bogalheads found it.
[00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:27.500]   They started posts.
[00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:30.460]   They said, "Hey, there's a new Bogaheads forum."
[00:43:30.460 --> 00:43:33.580]   So, now I went over, and I took a look at it,
[00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:35.220]   and I went, "Oh, my God.
[00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:40.700]   This is our future because we control this thing now,
[00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:43.540]   and we're not beholden to Morningstar,"
[00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:45.380]   even though Morningstar was very good to us.
[00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:47.500]   I don't mean to downgrade that.
[00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:53.020]   But the guy who set it up set it up as a joke,
[00:43:53.020 --> 00:43:55.140]   and he was just going to kill it.
[00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:58.020]   He just wanted to do this to show Morningstar
[00:43:58.020 --> 00:44:01.900]   what could be done, and I said, "No, don't let it go.
[00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:04.260]   We need to hang on to this."
[00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:08.860]   So, he didn't want to host it, and I had no way of hosting it.
[00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:12.060]   That's not my lane.
[00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:18.260]   So, I got a hold of Alex and Larry to see about hosting this,
[00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:20.700]   and that's how we took it over,
[00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:25.100]   and then I was member number seven,
[00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:28.700]   and then the word got out on the Morningstar forum,
[00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:30.460]   "Hey, Mel's over there."
[00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:33.420]   So, a number of people who thought
[00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:37.140]   that this gave it legitimacy started coming over,
[00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:43.900]   but Taylor, who I understand is on this now,
[00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:47.380]   Taylor was reluctant to join
[00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:50.660]   because he felt an allegiance to Joe Mansuito,
[00:44:50.660 --> 00:44:54.540]   the chairman of Morningstar, who had been very good to us,
[00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:56.420]   and so did I, really.
[00:44:56.420 --> 00:44:58.180]   So, I kept trying to get Taylor to come over.
[00:44:58.180 --> 00:44:59.500]   He wouldn't come over.
[00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:02.580]   Finally, I said, "Taylor, we'll make a deal with you.
[00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:06.580]   You and I, out of respect for Joe,
[00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:09.340]   we'll continue to post on both forums."
[00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:12.580]   So, Taylor agreed, and that was our deal.
[00:45:12.580 --> 00:45:15.780]   Taylor came over, and of course, then the floodgates,
[00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:19.020]   because now it was totally legitimate, the floodgates,
[00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:22.140]   and for a number of --
[00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:24.220]   I don't remember how long it was,
[00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:30.940]   but for a while, Alex and Larry put up a split screen
[00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:34.700]   which showed posts on the Morningstar forum on one side
[00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:38.100]   and posts on the Diehards forum on the other side
[00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:42.660]   so people could go there and choose where they wanted to --
[00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:47.380]   which threads they wanted to see.
[00:45:47.380 --> 00:45:49.700]   But what happened is, after a while,
[00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:51.580]   there was nothing on the Morningstar side,
[00:45:51.580 --> 00:45:54.420]   and everything was on the Bogeyhead side,
[00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:56.580]   so we stopped that.
[00:45:56.580 --> 00:46:01.860]   And that's basically how the forum got started.
[00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:03.940]   It started as a joke.
[00:46:03.940 --> 00:46:06.860]   Fortunately, I realized that this was our future,
[00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:10.900]   and obviously, that's the case now.
[00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:14.020]   The number of posts we get, the number of hits we get,
[00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:18.860]   the number of members we have are all just through the roof.
[00:46:18.860 --> 00:46:23.620]   So it's been quite a ride,
[00:46:23.620 --> 00:46:29.300]   and Taylor and I are still posting on there.
[00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:30.660]   -Did you have in your wildest dreams
[00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:33.780]   the idea that you'd go from that fake,
[00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:37.340]   almost protest forum back in 2002 to what it is right now?
[00:46:37.340 --> 00:46:39.580]   I mean, when did it dawn on you that this thing
[00:46:39.580 --> 00:46:42.140]   is out of control in a great way?
[00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:44.100]   When did that dawn on you?
[00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:46.100]   -And it still is.
[00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:48.460]   For instance, it was maybe a week or so ago,
[00:46:48.460 --> 00:46:51.140]   a couple weeks ago, I just opened the latest chapter
[00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:52.940]   in Germany.
[00:46:52.940 --> 00:46:56.500]   We have something like 90 chapters now,
[00:46:56.500 --> 00:47:01.460]   10 of which are, I think, about 10 are in foreign countries.
[00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:05.020]   It's just mind-blowing when you consider
[00:47:05.020 --> 00:47:09.180]   that we were just a few guys on Morningstar
[00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:11.220]   trying to help other investors,
[00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:14.180]   and now we have this worldwide organization.
[00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:17.860]   We have best-selling books.
[00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:22.340]   We have national conferences.
[00:47:22.340 --> 00:47:26.540]   And of course, being connected to Jack Bogle
[00:47:26.540 --> 00:47:29.980]   was really the key to our success.
[00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:32.380]   I mean, how many people have written books
[00:47:32.380 --> 00:47:34.340]   and can't get anybody to even look at them?
[00:47:34.340 --> 00:47:36.220]   And here we have a publisher calling
[00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:38.180]   and asking us to write books,
[00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:41.780]   and I hung up on them a number of times.
[00:47:41.780 --> 00:47:45.260]   I thought it was a hoax because I know that publishers
[00:47:45.260 --> 00:47:47.140]   just don't call you and ask you to write a book
[00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:48.980]   when you're an unknown.
[00:47:48.980 --> 00:47:55.060]   But, yeah, so it was writing the book
[00:47:55.060 --> 00:47:57.220]   and then having it come out
[00:47:57.220 --> 00:48:01.620]   and then becoming one of the top 10 books
[00:48:01.620 --> 00:48:04.260]   selected by Amazon for 2006.
[00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:08.740]   Of course, all of that stuff just gave us more publicity.
[00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:14.780]   When we had our first conference in Miami,
[00:48:14.780 --> 00:48:18.940]   there's a back story to this, which I'd like to share.
[00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:27.140]   Taylor and I, I made a post in 1999,
[00:48:27.140 --> 00:48:29.020]   I guess it was, at Thanksgiving,
[00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:30.740]   saying, "Happy Thanksgiving.
[00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:32.140]   Here's what I'm thankful for."
[00:48:32.140 --> 00:48:34.980]   And then everybody was chiming in,
[00:48:34.980 --> 00:48:36.900]   and Taylor chimed in and said,
[00:48:36.900 --> 00:48:39.980]   "I'm thankful for my wife and my kids and all that,
[00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:41.940]   but I'm thankful to Jack Bogle,
[00:48:41.940 --> 00:48:44.580]   also thankful to Jack Bogle
[00:48:44.580 --> 00:48:47.260]   because I live in the house that Jack built."
[00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:49.580]   Well, again, as I said, Jack monitored our --
[00:48:49.580 --> 00:48:52.700]   watched our forum from time to time, and he saw that.
[00:48:52.700 --> 00:48:55.380]   And he sent a handwritten note to us
[00:48:55.380 --> 00:48:58.060]   asking if there was any interest in getting together
[00:48:58.060 --> 00:49:00.780]   with him at a non-resort place.
[00:49:00.780 --> 00:49:03.180]   Well, for us, that was like getting an invitation
[00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:07.220]   to an audience with the Pope or an invitation to the White House.
[00:49:07.220 --> 00:49:08.660]   So Taylor and I tried to figure out
[00:49:08.660 --> 00:49:12.140]   how we were going to pull this off.
[00:49:12.140 --> 00:49:14.700]   And I was a snowbird at that time.
[00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:16.660]   It's been the winters in Florida.
[00:49:16.660 --> 00:49:18.300]   Taylor knew that.
[00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:21.060]   And Jack was going to be the keynote speaker
[00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:24.020]   at the Miami Herald Making Money Seminar.
[00:49:24.020 --> 00:49:26.180]   So Taylor said, "Hey, Mel, why don't we use this
[00:49:26.180 --> 00:49:29.980]   as an opportunity to try to get together with Jack?"
[00:49:29.980 --> 00:49:32.420]   So I said, "Well, that's great. We'll do that."
[00:49:32.420 --> 00:49:34.780]   So I got in touch with the Miami Herald people,
[00:49:34.780 --> 00:49:38.940]   and I asked them if they could give us a room somewhere
[00:49:38.940 --> 00:49:40.340]   where we could get together with Jack
[00:49:40.340 --> 00:49:42.460]   for an hour or two for lunch.
[00:49:42.460 --> 00:49:44.860]   And they shoot us away like a bunch of groupies,
[00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:46.460]   which actually we were.
[00:49:46.460 --> 00:49:49.260]   And they said, "No, we've got Jack all tied up.
[00:49:49.260 --> 00:49:51.060]   We don't have time.
[00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:56.340]   So you'll have to just go about your business."
[00:49:56.340 --> 00:49:58.700]   So anyway, I called Jack and said,
[00:49:58.700 --> 00:50:00.700]   "Hey," they said, "We can't get together."
[00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:03.580]   And he said, "Well, hey, I'll go wherever you want me."
[00:50:03.580 --> 00:50:06.980]   So now we made a post.
[00:50:06.980 --> 00:50:08.820]   We only had about 20-something people
[00:50:08.820 --> 00:50:10.820]   because it was very short notice.
[00:50:10.820 --> 00:50:16.460]   So we decided to hold it at Taylor's 35th-floor condo
[00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:18.700]   overlooking Biscayne Bay.
[00:50:18.700 --> 00:50:23.460]   And we hired a chef and a maid
[00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:27.620]   and had this nice thing with Jack.
[00:50:27.620 --> 00:50:29.980]   But in the meantime, the Miami Herald got word
[00:50:29.980 --> 00:50:32.220]   that we're having this event with Jack,
[00:50:32.220 --> 00:50:34.660]   and they want to cover it.
[00:50:34.660 --> 00:50:36.700]   So they come hat in hand and said,
[00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:39.980]   "Mel, can we send a reporter and a photographer?"
[00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:42.340]   Well, instead of being jerks like they were to us,
[00:50:42.340 --> 00:50:43.740]   we said, "Sure."
[00:50:43.740 --> 00:50:47.540]   So they send the photographer and the reporter,
[00:50:47.540 --> 00:50:49.380]   and we ended up with a front-page story
[00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:51.180]   in the business section of the Miami Herald
[00:50:51.180 --> 00:50:53.260]   carried over into the inside.
[00:50:53.260 --> 00:50:56.980]   So all of these things just gave us a little more publicity,
[00:50:56.980 --> 00:50:59.220]   and we became a little better known.
[00:50:59.220 --> 00:51:01.060]   The next year, Jason Zweig,
[00:51:01.060 --> 00:51:03.060]   who's now with Wall Street Journal,
[00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:06.620]   was with Money Magazine then.
[00:51:06.620 --> 00:51:10.540]   Jason wanted to come and cover our conference
[00:51:10.540 --> 00:51:13.060]   and bring a photographer.
[00:51:13.060 --> 00:51:15.860]   So we ended up with a six-, eight-page spread
[00:51:15.860 --> 00:51:18.300]   in Money Magazine with all kinds of photos and that.
[00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:21.020]   So again, more exposure.
[00:51:21.020 --> 00:51:24.180]   And then the book, and it just continued to build,
[00:51:24.180 --> 00:51:25.940]   and it still continues to this day.
[00:51:25.940 --> 00:51:29.300]   So, yeah, it's just mind-blowing
[00:51:29.300 --> 00:51:32.900]   when you think of where we started and where it is now.
[00:51:32.900 --> 00:51:33.900]   - No, it's amazing.
[00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:35.860]   Just this morning, I did some metrics here,
[00:51:35.860 --> 00:51:38.740]   and there just happened to be 703 people who were online
[00:51:38.740 --> 00:51:40.820]   when I looked right before the meeting here.
[00:51:40.820 --> 00:51:45.820]   There's been 5,941,000 posts since that forum was created.
[00:51:45.820 --> 00:51:50.340]   And there's 109,000 members that have actually registered.
[00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:51.980]   That probably gets 10 times the amount of traffic
[00:51:51.980 --> 00:51:53.180]   of people that don't register.
[00:51:53.180 --> 00:51:55.580]   So there's probably over a million people, I'm sure,
[00:51:55.580 --> 00:51:57.380]   have hit that page in the last year.
[00:51:57.380 --> 00:51:59.980]   So that's amazing, isn't it?
[00:51:59.980 --> 00:52:00.820]   - Yeah, it is.
[00:52:00.820 --> 00:52:03.700]   And when anytime I can see the back numbers,
[00:52:03.700 --> 00:52:08.220]   and anytime you see 700 people online,
[00:52:08.220 --> 00:52:12.860]   for members, there's usually about 10 guests
[00:52:12.860 --> 00:52:15.060]   for each member that's online.
[00:52:15.060 --> 00:52:18.820]   'Cause they can read, people can read anytime they want.
[00:52:18.820 --> 00:52:20.020]   They don't have to sign up.
[00:52:20.020 --> 00:52:24.260]   You only sign up if you want to make a post.
[00:52:24.260 --> 00:52:27.940]   So there are more and more visitors,
[00:52:27.940 --> 00:52:30.340]   and they're from all around the world,
[00:52:30.340 --> 00:52:32.380]   which is amazing too.
[00:52:32.380 --> 00:52:34.660]   - You know, personally, I used to have to look for like,
[00:52:34.660 --> 00:52:37.500]   what's the expense ratio of VTI, Boglehead.
[00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:38.420]   And I put that on there.
[00:52:38.420 --> 00:52:39.860]   Now I don't have to put Boglehead.
[00:52:39.860 --> 00:52:41.780]   When I look at my Google results,
[00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:43.060]   for the top five links,
[00:52:43.060 --> 00:52:44.620]   you're going to Boglehead Wiki or somewhere.
[00:52:44.620 --> 00:52:45.820]   It's just awesome.
[00:52:45.820 --> 00:52:48.540]   - Yeah, it's been an amazing ride.
[00:52:48.540 --> 00:52:50.300]   And to have all those conferences.
[00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:51.820]   We thought, Taylor and I thought,
[00:52:51.820 --> 00:52:55.100]   that to get together with Jack in Miami
[00:52:55.100 --> 00:52:57.460]   was gonna be a one-time off.
[00:52:57.460 --> 00:52:59.780]   And then everybody's asking on the forum,
[00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:00.620]   when's the next one?
[00:53:00.620 --> 00:53:01.460]   When's the next one?
[00:53:01.460 --> 00:53:03.420]   And they're, oh my God, we weren't even-
[00:53:03.420 --> 00:53:05.300]   - Yeah, 20 years later.
[00:53:05.300 --> 00:53:06.380]   Well, let me ask you a question.
[00:53:06.380 --> 00:53:07.460]   When is the next one?
[00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:12.180]   - This year is not gonna be an in-person.
[00:53:12.180 --> 00:53:13.940]   It'll probably be a virtual.
[00:53:13.940 --> 00:53:18.500]   I have to say in the beginning,
[00:53:18.500 --> 00:53:22.220]   I am no longer running the conferences.
[00:53:22.220 --> 00:53:23.780]   I'm not on the team anymore.
[00:53:23.780 --> 00:53:27.220]   But from what I understand,
[00:53:27.220 --> 00:53:28.740]   it's gonna be virtual this year.
[00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:30.780]   Next year will be a conference.
[00:53:30.780 --> 00:53:33.740]   And initially we moved the conferences
[00:53:33.740 --> 00:53:35.980]   all around the country.
[00:53:35.980 --> 00:53:38.380]   But then when Jack's health started deteriorating,
[00:53:38.380 --> 00:53:40.060]   we stayed in Philly.
[00:53:40.060 --> 00:53:43.420]   There's no reason to stay in Philly now
[00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:47.020]   because Jack is no longer with us.
[00:53:47.020 --> 00:53:51.460]   So it's probably gonna be moved around the country again.
[00:53:51.460 --> 00:53:53.180]   It's probably gonna be a lot longer.
[00:53:53.180 --> 00:53:56.780]   There's different team running the operation.
[00:53:56.780 --> 00:54:01.340]   And I think their goal or their idea
[00:54:01.340 --> 00:54:04.540]   is to have this big deal.
[00:54:04.540 --> 00:54:06.900]   I tried to purposely keep it smaller
[00:54:06.900 --> 00:54:08.060]   so that it would be intimate
[00:54:08.060 --> 00:54:10.500]   and people could talk to Jack and Bill Bernstein
[00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:12.980]   and Rick and the other people that were there.
[00:54:12.980 --> 00:54:18.820]   So now I don't know where it's gonna be,
[00:54:18.820 --> 00:54:23.820]   but we'll have to see when they finally figure it out.
[00:54:23.820 --> 00:54:25.700]   'Cause they want it to be somewhere
[00:54:25.700 --> 00:54:27.660]   where people can connect direct flight
[00:54:27.660 --> 00:54:29.940]   without having to go through
[00:54:29.940 --> 00:54:32.940]   a number of transfers and so forth.
[00:54:32.940 --> 00:54:35.980]   So that's all in the works.
[00:54:35.980 --> 00:54:40.180]   And I really am not privy to what's going on
[00:54:40.180 --> 00:54:44.980]   other than I know it's gonna be a big one in 2022.
[00:54:44.980 --> 00:54:45.820]   - No, that sounds great.
[00:54:45.820 --> 00:54:47.620]   Thanks for that update.
[00:54:47.620 --> 00:54:48.860]   - Can I just pipe in?
[00:54:48.860 --> 00:54:53.860]   Yeah, the goal is a October 2022 larger conference
[00:54:55.180 --> 00:54:57.540]   at a location yet to be determined.
[00:54:57.540 --> 00:54:59.780]   - Good to know.
[00:54:59.780 --> 00:55:03.420]   Getting back to books, Mel.
[00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:05.100]   So there's been three successful books.
[00:55:05.100 --> 00:55:06.940]   Is there any, are they keep calling
[00:55:06.940 --> 00:55:08.700]   or is there gonna be a fourth in the series?
[00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:10.300]   Do you know anything about that?
[00:55:10.300 --> 00:55:12.220]   - Well, first of all, I have to tell you
[00:55:12.220 --> 00:55:13.660]   that our publisher is Wally
[00:55:13.660 --> 00:55:16.260]   and Wally publishes the Dummies books
[00:55:16.260 --> 00:55:18.260]   as you know the Dummies books.
[00:55:18.260 --> 00:55:19.820]   Well, the Dummies books,
[00:55:19.820 --> 00:55:24.140]   each one is written by a specialist in the topic.
[00:55:24.140 --> 00:55:26.420]   But Wally figured that the Bogleheads
[00:55:26.420 --> 00:55:29.380]   was gonna be a series like the Dummies books.
[00:55:29.380 --> 00:55:31.140]   And of course, there are only a few of us
[00:55:31.140 --> 00:55:32.060]   writing these things.
[00:55:32.060 --> 00:55:36.620]   So it takes nine months to a year to write a book.
[00:55:36.620 --> 00:55:37.580]   And it's-
[00:55:37.580 --> 00:55:40.020]   - By the way, if you can see what Taylor's doing,
[00:55:40.020 --> 00:55:43.300]   I think he's holding up a Boglehead book in Chinese.
[00:55:43.300 --> 00:55:45.780]   - Well, our books have been converted
[00:55:45.780 --> 00:55:50.340]   and I had boxes of books show up on my doorstep.
[00:55:50.340 --> 00:55:53.700]   And I had no idea what they were.
[00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:57.380]   I thought somebody got the wrong shipment here.
[00:55:57.380 --> 00:55:59.820]   And it turns out it was one of our versions.
[00:55:59.820 --> 00:56:02.380]   We have several versions in Chinese.
[00:56:02.380 --> 00:56:09.580]   But yes, Taylor's book will probably end up,
[00:56:09.580 --> 00:56:11.660]   the latest book, "The Three Fund Portfolio"
[00:56:11.660 --> 00:56:13.180]   will probably end up in Chinese
[00:56:13.180 --> 00:56:14.660]   because our other books have.
[00:56:14.660 --> 00:56:21.180]   But over time, I've been kind of busy.
[00:56:21.180 --> 00:56:23.220]   I worked with Taylor on his book,
[00:56:23.220 --> 00:56:25.140]   but it was Taylor's book.
[00:56:25.140 --> 00:56:27.220]   That's his baby.
[00:56:27.220 --> 00:56:30.300]   I also worked with a couple of Boglehead doctors
[00:56:30.300 --> 00:56:33.500]   who have a new book coming out.
[00:56:33.500 --> 00:56:35.140]   It should be out any day now.
[00:56:35.140 --> 00:56:41.260]   And it's specifically geared towards doctors
[00:56:41.260 --> 00:56:44.340]   and financing.
[00:56:44.340 --> 00:56:45.660]   So I've been busy with that.
[00:56:45.660 --> 00:56:47.060]   I've been busy with a lot of this stuff,
[00:56:47.060 --> 00:56:50.060]   but I keep feeling that any day
[00:56:50.060 --> 00:56:52.380]   we're gonna get that call from Wally saying,
[00:56:52.380 --> 00:56:54.460]   "Hey, how about another book?"
[00:56:54.460 --> 00:57:01.220]   Or else asking us to update, go to the third edition.
[00:57:01.220 --> 00:57:04.900]   And I called Michael ahead of time to ask him,
[00:57:04.900 --> 00:57:07.100]   "Michael, are you gonna be up to another book?"
[00:57:07.100 --> 00:57:09.380]   Because I got a feeling I'm gonna get a call.
[00:57:09.380 --> 00:57:13.580]   So sure enough, a day after I talked to Michael,
[00:57:13.580 --> 00:57:15.620]   I get a call from Wally.
[00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:20.100]   And they said, "Mel, Barnes & Noble
[00:57:20.100 --> 00:57:23.940]   "has got this huge, wants this huge order of your book,
[00:57:23.940 --> 00:57:27.740]   "but they want a paperback version.
[00:57:27.740 --> 00:57:30.780]   "And we don't have a paperback version
[00:57:30.780 --> 00:57:31.900]   "of the second edition."
[00:57:31.900 --> 00:57:36.900]   So he said, "Mel, we need something for the cover."
[00:57:36.900 --> 00:57:40.220]   And I said, "Well, you've got,
[00:57:40.220 --> 00:57:44.900]   "Jack Bogle wrote the foreword.
[00:57:44.900 --> 00:57:46.260]   "So just pull something out of there
[00:57:46.260 --> 00:57:47.260]   "and put it on the cover.
[00:57:47.260 --> 00:57:49.220]   "One of Jack's 50 sayings, you know,
[00:57:49.220 --> 00:57:51.620]   "the Bogleheads, whatever."
[00:57:51.620 --> 00:57:54.980]   And so we do have a paperback coming out
[00:57:54.980 --> 00:57:59.660]   and it'll be available at some point at Barnes & Noble.
[00:57:59.660 --> 00:58:04.660]   But I really, you know, I have a political career now.
[00:58:04.660 --> 00:58:10.740]   I got elected in 2016 as a city council member,
[00:58:10.740 --> 00:58:12.340]   2018 got reelected.
[00:58:12.340 --> 00:58:15.300]   And then 2020, I became vice mayor.
[00:58:15.300 --> 00:58:18.180]   So I'm helping run a city,
[00:58:18.180 --> 00:58:21.420]   helping other people with their books,
[00:58:21.420 --> 00:58:23.620]   doing work on the forum.
[00:58:23.620 --> 00:58:27.500]   I am pretty busy and I just don't know
[00:58:27.500 --> 00:58:30.100]   whether I have time for another book.
[00:58:30.100 --> 00:58:31.220]   - Well, now talking about busy,
[00:58:31.220 --> 00:58:33.180]   that sounds incredibly busy.
[00:58:33.180 --> 00:58:35.460]   Before we pivot back to Alan, Mel,
[00:58:35.460 --> 00:58:36.540]   you knew Jack really well.
[00:58:36.540 --> 00:58:38.460]   Is there one thing you could tell us about him
[00:58:38.460 --> 00:58:40.860]   that maybe a lot of people don't know about him?
[00:58:41.700 --> 00:58:44.260]   - Well, I don't know that everyone knows
[00:58:44.260 --> 00:58:48.580]   that Jack had a heart replacement.
[00:58:48.580 --> 00:58:52.100]   And because of the heart replacement,
[00:58:52.100 --> 00:58:56.020]   he had to take drugs to keep the anti-rejection drugs.
[00:58:56.020 --> 00:59:00.500]   But the anti-rejection drugs cause all kinds of things
[00:59:00.500 --> 00:59:05.260]   that are minor to you and me turn into major deals
[00:59:05.260 --> 00:59:08.500]   when you get, once he would get an infection.
[00:59:09.340 --> 00:59:13.180]   Jack used to end up in the hospital a lot.
[00:59:13.180 --> 00:59:15.780]   And of course our planning was nine months long
[00:59:15.780 --> 00:59:17.460]   for the conferences.
[00:59:17.460 --> 00:59:21.900]   And Jack was the, of course, the focal point.
[00:59:21.900 --> 00:59:23.060]   Well, I would get calls.
[00:59:23.060 --> 00:59:26.940]   I got calls a number of times in the summer
[00:59:26.940 --> 00:59:29.540]   saying Jack is in the hospital
[00:59:29.540 --> 00:59:32.700]   and we don't think he's gonna be able to make the conference
[00:59:32.700 --> 00:59:35.420]   and things aren't good.
[00:59:35.420 --> 00:59:40.420]   So we had a number of scares over the years
[00:59:40.420 --> 00:59:41.860]   with Jack's health.
[00:59:41.860 --> 00:59:47.780]   And Jack had attended, despite being in the hospital,
[00:59:47.780 --> 00:59:50.340]   he would get out and he would get better
[00:59:50.340 --> 00:59:51.700]   and he would make the conferences.
[00:59:51.700 --> 00:59:56.140]   But it was real close to our Dallas Fort Worth conference
[00:59:56.140 --> 00:59:57.900]   when I got the call that Jack
[00:59:57.900 --> 01:00:00.340]   is not gonna be able to make it.
[01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:04.140]   So we had to go to plan B
[01:00:04.140 --> 01:00:08.220]   and create a different agenda
[01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:11.140]   and get different speakers and so forth, which we did.
[01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:15.500]   But at the conference, Kevin, who was Jack's assistant,
[01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:18.460]   said, "Jack wants to call on your cell phone
[01:00:18.460 --> 01:00:19.900]   "from the hospital.
[01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:24.900]   "And he wants you to hold your phone up to the microphone
[01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:28.980]   "and speak to the bogo heads."
[01:00:28.980 --> 01:00:30.660]   So I said, "Well, that's gonna get squeals
[01:00:30.660 --> 01:00:31.500]   "and everything else."
[01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:33.860]   So I quickly got a phone line
[01:00:33.860 --> 01:00:36.100]   and put in the hotel and the conference room,
[01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:39.260]   had it wired to the speakers in the conference room.
[01:00:39.260 --> 01:00:43.260]   And sure enough, Jack calls at the appointed time
[01:00:43.260 --> 01:00:48.180]   and proceeded to speak to his bogo heads.
[01:00:48.180 --> 01:00:50.980]   And there wasn't a dry eye in the place.
[01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:52.660]   And we were trying to figure out
[01:00:52.660 --> 01:00:55.860]   how Jack even got a cell phone in intensive care.
[01:00:55.860 --> 01:01:00.860]   But anyway, so since Jack got the call,
[01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:04.940]   spoke to us over the phone,
[01:01:04.940 --> 01:01:08.580]   we considered that his attendance
[01:01:08.580 --> 01:01:11.060]   and not break his perfect attendance record.
[01:01:11.060 --> 01:01:13.620]   So Jack's attendance record is still intact
[01:01:13.620 --> 01:01:16.220]   because of that speaking to the bogo heads
[01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:18.180]   over from the hospital.
[01:01:18.180 --> 01:01:20.060]   So he loved his bogo heads.
[01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:21.540]   They meant so much to him.
[01:01:21.540 --> 01:01:24.020]   And of course he did to us too.
[01:01:24.020 --> 01:01:27.220]   So he was really special.
[01:01:27.220 --> 01:01:28.740]   - Yeah, those are great stories.
[01:01:28.740 --> 01:01:30.180]   Thanks so much for that, Mel.
[01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:32.660]   And now I don't know how to awkwardly
[01:01:32.660 --> 01:01:35.340]   pivot away from those great stories back to finances,
[01:01:35.340 --> 01:01:37.660]   but I'm just gonna plunge into some of these questions.
[01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:40.780]   So for Alan or Mel, feel free to jump in here too.
[01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:43.540]   Bond portion of the portfolio,
[01:01:43.540 --> 01:01:46.460]   should it be total bond market
[01:01:46.460 --> 01:01:49.420]   or is it short-term bonds based on today's environment
[01:01:49.420 --> 01:01:50.260]   or a mix?
[01:01:50.260 --> 01:01:53.060]   And if it's a mix, what ratio is the question that came in?
[01:01:53.060 --> 01:01:57.060]   - You want me to take that?
[01:01:57.060 --> 01:01:57.900]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:01:57.900 --> 01:02:00.420]   - Okay, Alan, if you could take that, that'd be great.
[01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:01.260]   - Sure.
[01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:07.900]   Total bond is my core bond fund.
[01:02:07.900 --> 01:02:10.900]   I also use some direct CDs
[01:02:10.900 --> 01:02:14.060]   that have easy early withdrawal penalty,
[01:02:14.060 --> 01:02:19.060]   but all of my fixed income is high credit quality.
[01:02:19.060 --> 01:02:24.900]   The thing about a short-term bond is it's kind of like cash.
[01:02:25.660 --> 01:02:30.660]   You're guaranteed to underperform the inflation
[01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:34.860]   and lose spending power.
[01:02:34.860 --> 01:02:37.980]   So in general, I believe in an intermediate bond fund,
[01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:39.700]   especially 'cause our yield curve
[01:02:39.700 --> 01:02:42.740]   is positively sloped right now.
[01:02:42.740 --> 01:02:45.220]   I don't have the guts to go long-term
[01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:48.660]   and then short-term, like I said,
[01:02:48.660 --> 01:02:51.900]   it's practically guaranteed to underperform
[01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:55.260]   and you're better off doing something like a,
[01:02:55.260 --> 01:02:57.420]   there's several savings accounts,
[01:02:57.420 --> 01:03:02.420]   FDIC or NCUA insured paying between 0.5 and 0.85.
[01:03:02.420 --> 01:03:04.300]   So I would argue that's better
[01:03:04.300 --> 01:03:08.060]   than a Vanguard short-term bond index fund,
[01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:12.700]   which I'm guessing is paying somewhere around 0.45, 0.5%
[01:03:12.700 --> 01:03:13.940]   and has some risk.
[01:03:13.940 --> 01:03:19.540]   - Well, I agree with Alan on the investment grade.
[01:03:19.540 --> 01:03:22.980]   I think that duration has to be considered.
[01:03:22.980 --> 01:03:26.300]   So for most people, the intermediate is gonna work,
[01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:28.300]   but for short-term needs,
[01:03:28.300 --> 01:03:32.860]   I like a short-term investment grade bond at Vanguard.
[01:03:32.860 --> 01:03:35.500]   But one thing that isn't mentioned
[01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:37.180]   and Alan touched on inflation
[01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:40.740]   and one way right now to (indistinct)
[01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:43.300]   is I-bonds.
[01:03:43.300 --> 01:03:48.300]   So I think there's a place in most portfolios for I-bonds.
[01:03:49.780 --> 01:03:53.420]   There is the purchase limit of 10,000 per person per year,
[01:03:53.420 --> 01:03:56.740]   but you can get one for the husband, one for the wife,
[01:03:56.740 --> 01:04:00.060]   you can get 5,000 back in your tax return.
[01:04:00.060 --> 01:04:03.340]   And if you have trust, you can also get another 10,000.
[01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:06.020]   So it doesn't take long to accumulate
[01:04:06.020 --> 01:04:11.340]   a fair amount of inflation protection with the I-bonds.
[01:04:11.340 --> 01:04:13.860]   - I've been hearing you hawk the I-bonds
[01:04:13.860 --> 01:04:15.660]   for about 20 years now, I think, Mel.
[01:04:15.660 --> 01:04:17.420]   They never put a little flavor.
[01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:19.380]   - Yeah, well, the thing is,
[01:04:19.380 --> 01:04:21.900]   is that the people who backed up the truck
[01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:24.580]   when I suggested they do,
[01:04:24.580 --> 01:04:29.500]   they're sitting on those 3033, 3436 real yield bonds
[01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:31.940]   that are paying 7% now.
[01:04:31.940 --> 01:04:36.860]   They are sitting, looking for profit.
[01:04:36.860 --> 01:04:38.900]   - That's amazing in today's low interest environment
[01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:40.300]   for the people that took your advice,
[01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:41.540]   I guess, back in the day.
[01:04:41.540 --> 01:04:45.700]   Shifting to capital gains tax,
[01:04:45.700 --> 01:04:48.780]   it's been possibly doubling for high earners
[01:04:48.780 --> 01:04:50.020]   at some future point.
[01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:52.060]   And if that's an eventuality,
[01:04:52.060 --> 01:04:54.820]   is there anything we could be doing now
[01:04:54.820 --> 01:04:57.740]   to prepare for a higher capital gains in the future?
[01:04:57.740 --> 01:05:04.060]   For either Alan or Mel.
[01:05:04.060 --> 01:05:04.900]   - Mel, do you want to take it?
[01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:06.860]   I'm happy to take it.
[01:05:06.860 --> 01:05:07.700]   - That's money.
[01:05:07.700 --> 01:05:13.300]   - You know, the only thing harder than-
[01:05:13.300 --> 01:05:14.900]   - I'm sorry, go ahead, Alan.
[01:05:14.900 --> 01:05:16.620]   - The only thing harder than predicting the market
[01:05:16.620 --> 01:05:19.820]   is predicting what politicians will do.
[01:05:19.820 --> 01:05:23.860]   - Yeah, in fact, we don't even allow discussions
[01:05:23.860 --> 01:05:26.940]   of regulations on the forum
[01:05:26.940 --> 01:05:29.460]   simply because people might make a bad decision
[01:05:29.460 --> 01:05:32.300]   based on something that may never happen.
[01:05:32.300 --> 01:05:37.300]   So you have to go with the law the way it is.
[01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:39.900]   - The current Biden proposal
[01:05:39.900 --> 01:05:44.460]   is for those with over a million dollars
[01:05:44.460 --> 01:05:48.820]   of income, and the current Biden proposal
[01:05:48.820 --> 01:05:51.540]   has it retroactive to April 28th.
[01:05:51.540 --> 01:05:56.300]   Now, again, I don't predict,
[01:05:56.300 --> 01:05:57.980]   you know, everything in that proposal
[01:05:57.980 --> 01:06:00.340]   I think is unlikely to go through,
[01:06:00.340 --> 01:06:04.260]   especially in our current political climate.
[01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:06.300]   But I mean, if that were going to happen,
[01:06:06.300 --> 01:06:08.940]   and if you were going to sell it while you were alive,
[01:06:08.940 --> 01:06:11.660]   then yes, you would want a tax gain harvest.
[01:06:11.660 --> 01:06:12.580]   But I think that would be
[01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:16.220]   an incredibly dangerous thing to do.
[01:06:16.220 --> 01:06:22.380]   So what I'm telling clients is do nothing right now.
[01:06:22.380 --> 01:06:23.380]   - Okay, good.
[01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:27.260]   Follow up to that with inflation starting to perk up,
[01:06:27.260 --> 01:06:28.100]   there's a question around
[01:06:28.100 --> 01:06:30.020]   any proposed changes to the portfolios.
[01:06:30.020 --> 01:06:32.020]   Is now a time to get more into tips
[01:06:32.020 --> 01:06:34.260]   if you haven't been historically here with inflation,
[01:06:34.260 --> 01:06:36.580]   perking up, what do you recommend
[01:06:36.580 --> 01:06:38.620]   for changes to the best allocation?
[01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:43.260]   - Mel, do you want me to take it?
[01:06:43.260 --> 01:06:44.220]   - Yeah, go ahead.
[01:06:44.220 --> 01:06:45.460]   - Okay.
[01:06:45.460 --> 01:06:46.660]   Absolutely nothing.
[01:06:46.660 --> 01:06:48.620]   Inflation has perked up.
[01:06:48.620 --> 01:06:52.780]   I think I mentioned that I,
[01:06:52.780 --> 01:06:54.820]   along with the top economists in the world,
[01:06:54.820 --> 01:06:58.020]   have a horrible track record of predicting interest rates,
[01:06:58.020 --> 01:07:01.260]   and those interest rates are tied to inflation.
[01:07:01.260 --> 01:07:05.620]   So certainly we have had some, you know,
[01:07:05.620 --> 01:07:07.860]   greater inflation in the last few months.
[01:07:07.860 --> 01:07:09.340]   Whether or not it will continue,
[01:07:09.340 --> 01:07:12.940]   the bond market is actually saying we don't think so.
[01:07:12.940 --> 01:07:16.100]   You know, the way I learned economics
[01:07:16.100 --> 01:07:18.940]   is that more money chasing the same amount of goods
[01:07:18.940 --> 01:07:21.740]   and services causes a lot of inflation.
[01:07:21.740 --> 01:07:25.020]   But Japan has been printing more money than we have
[01:07:25.020 --> 01:07:28.020]   for decades and fighting deflation.
[01:07:28.020 --> 01:07:33.860]   So I would resist the urge to try to predict inflation.
[01:07:33.860 --> 01:07:35.980]   The I bonds are certainly better than the tips.
[01:07:35.980 --> 01:07:40.980]   I think I looked at the Vanguard Intermediate Tips Fund.
[01:07:40.980 --> 01:07:45.660]   It had a negative yield of something like 1.65%,
[01:07:45.660 --> 01:07:48.980]   meaning that if we had 2% inflation,
[01:07:48.980 --> 01:07:52.100]   then that's going to yield 0.35%.
[01:07:52.100 --> 01:07:55.220]   So CDs that have easy early withdrawal penalties,
[01:07:55.220 --> 01:07:58.060]   I bonds, you know, to the extent
[01:07:58.060 --> 01:08:01.140]   that it can be a material part of your portfolio,
[01:08:01.140 --> 01:08:03.220]   you know, I think are ways to go.
[01:08:03.220 --> 01:08:06.340]   And again, that's why I wouldn't go long-term
[01:08:06.340 --> 01:08:09.140]   on a bond fund, a long duration.
[01:08:09.140 --> 01:08:13.700]   - Yeah, I think Alan touched on the thing
[01:08:13.700 --> 01:08:14.860]   that's important to me
[01:08:14.860 --> 01:08:16.820]   and should be important to other investors
[01:08:16.820 --> 01:08:19.860]   is that at the current time,
[01:08:19.860 --> 01:08:23.620]   tips are not attractive to me
[01:08:23.620 --> 01:08:25.940]   simply because they have the negative yield
[01:08:25.940 --> 01:08:30.380]   guaranteed to get less money back than you put in.
[01:08:30.380 --> 01:08:35.380]   So at this point, I think the first 10, 20, 30, 35,000,
[01:08:35.380 --> 01:08:39.460]   whatever that you can afford to buy an I bond
[01:08:39.460 --> 01:08:42.500]   are the place to go for inflation protection now.
[01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:46.180]   And even with the current ones
[01:08:46.180 --> 01:08:50.180]   that they are selling with the zero fixed rate,
[01:08:50.180 --> 01:08:54.660]   you're still getting 3.54%, which is nothing to sneeze at.
[01:08:54.660 --> 01:08:57.940]   It's probably the most attractive rate
[01:08:57.940 --> 01:08:59.660]   that's out there that's risk-free.
[01:08:59.660 --> 01:09:04.660]   So my first 10, 20 or 30,000 would be in I bonds.
[01:09:04.660 --> 01:09:09.420]   - Okay, good to know.
[01:09:09.420 --> 01:09:11.660]   And I hesitate to ask this question
[01:09:11.660 --> 01:09:13.220]   with the room full of bullets
[01:09:13.220 --> 01:09:14.180]   'cause I think I know the answer
[01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:15.900]   with someone that suggested or asked,
[01:09:15.900 --> 01:09:17.260]   what do you think of cryptocurrencies
[01:09:17.260 --> 01:09:19.700]   like Bitcoin, Dogecoin, et cetera?
[01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:22.460]   Do they have a place in mass allocation?
[01:09:22.460 --> 01:09:23.660]   - Yeah, in the trash.
[01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:29.460]   - I own a little bit of Bitcoin,
[01:09:29.460 --> 01:09:32.020]   but only because I had to write about it
[01:09:32.020 --> 01:09:33.620]   and I wanted to actually make sure
[01:09:33.620 --> 01:09:36.740]   that what I was being told on how you buy it works.
[01:09:36.740 --> 01:09:40.940]   And Bitcoin, I'm not convinced it's gonna be worth zero.
[01:09:40.940 --> 01:09:44.060]   I think the odds are it'll be worth zero,
[01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:47.580]   but it does disintermediate the financial services industry
[01:09:47.580 --> 01:09:49.140]   and solve something.
[01:09:49.140 --> 01:09:52.500]   Dogecoin, like the Vogelheads, was started as a joke
[01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:54.340]   and it just absolutely amazes me
[01:09:54.340 --> 01:09:57.460]   that it has significant value.
[01:09:57.460 --> 01:09:59.420]   I don't think it's gonna be as successful
[01:09:59.420 --> 01:10:02.300]   as Mel and Taylor, what you guys created
[01:10:02.300 --> 01:10:03.460]   with the Vogelheads.
[01:10:03.460 --> 01:10:06.740]   - Well, I have a question for somebody
[01:10:06.740 --> 01:10:10.700]   who might have an answer.
[01:10:10.700 --> 01:10:12.460]   How do you buy or sell something,
[01:10:12.460 --> 01:10:15.420]   not the coin itself, but with the coin,
[01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:18.740]   when the value is changing dramatically
[01:10:18.740 --> 01:10:20.460]   every day, every hour?
[01:10:20.460 --> 01:10:24.380]   So you have something for sale for 10,000
[01:10:24.380 --> 01:10:28.780]   and somebody is gonna give you 10,000 in Bitcoin
[01:10:28.780 --> 01:10:32.260]   and five minutes later, it's worth 8,000.
[01:10:32.260 --> 01:10:36.260]   How do you set a price either as a buyer or a seller
[01:10:36.260 --> 01:10:40.340]   when the value is constantly changing?
[01:10:40.340 --> 01:10:45.740]   That's the question I would ask.
[01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:50.140]   For something to be effective, you have to have stability.
[01:10:50.140 --> 01:10:52.300]   And right now you have no stability
[01:10:52.300 --> 01:10:54.460]   and I don't know if you're ever gonna have it.
[01:10:54.460 --> 01:10:56.940]   - Yeah.
[01:10:56.940 --> 01:10:59.220]   Another question came in, I think based on a slide
[01:10:59.220 --> 01:11:00.860]   from your talk, Alan, would be,
[01:11:00.860 --> 01:11:02.820]   can you please explain why dividend stocks
[01:11:02.820 --> 01:11:04.380]   would not be a good investment?
[01:11:04.380 --> 01:11:10.460]   - Well, dividends are value stocks
[01:11:10.460 --> 01:11:14.220]   and they may outperform, they may underperform.
[01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:16.460]   They have grossly underperformed.
[01:11:16.460 --> 01:11:19.020]   I mean, there are certain really safe dividend stocks
[01:11:19.020 --> 01:11:23.700]   like Eastman Kodak, General Motors,
[01:11:23.700 --> 01:11:27.060]   more recently GE that are just blue chips
[01:11:27.060 --> 01:11:30.460]   that are gonna pay forever and that's just not true.
[01:11:30.460 --> 01:11:34.940]   And if you think of dividends, they're very tax inefficient
[01:11:34.940 --> 01:11:40.820]   because you would rather pay less taxes on the dividends.
[01:11:40.820 --> 01:11:45.940]   So I'm not totally against dividend stocks.
[01:11:45.940 --> 01:11:48.980]   In fact, I believe in growth.
[01:11:48.980 --> 01:11:51.780]   I believe in large cap, mid cap, small cap.
[01:11:51.780 --> 01:11:56.700]   The diversified portfolio is guaranteed
[01:11:56.700 --> 01:11:58.540]   to beat most investors.
[01:11:58.540 --> 01:12:01.100]   And you're far better off, by the way,
[01:12:01.100 --> 01:12:03.580]   controlling when you wanna recognize the gains
[01:12:03.580 --> 01:12:08.220]   by selling the long-term capital gains than the dividends.
[01:12:08.220 --> 01:12:12.380]   So I'm against a dividend tilted portfolio.
[01:12:12.380 --> 01:12:14.040]   I believe in everything.
[01:12:15.020 --> 01:12:18.980]   Taylor's refund portfolio is all you need.
[01:12:18.980 --> 01:12:23.380]   - That's a question from down below.
[01:12:23.380 --> 01:12:24.540]   And I think this question was asked
[01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:25.740]   not knowing Taylor would be here.
[01:12:25.740 --> 01:12:27.500]   So people are asking if you're a fan
[01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:30.180]   of the two fund portfolio from Jack Bogle,
[01:12:30.180 --> 01:12:32.740]   I think it was, is it VT everything
[01:12:32.740 --> 01:12:34.060]   and then total bond in the U.S.
[01:12:34.060 --> 01:12:35.780]   Or the three fund from Taylor
[01:12:35.780 --> 01:12:38.780]   or the four fund portfolio from Rick Ferry.
[01:12:38.780 --> 01:12:42.820]   I guess, are you a fan of that?
[01:12:42.820 --> 01:12:45.060]   Was it either the two fund, the three fund
[01:12:45.060 --> 01:12:48.100]   or the four fund was a question out there.
[01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:49.620]   And I think you already gave your answer, Alan.
[01:12:49.620 --> 01:12:52.100]   You said the three fund, but is there a space
[01:12:52.100 --> 01:12:55.440]   or one much you consider a two fund or a four fund?
[01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:59.140]   - Well, what can have a single fund,
[01:12:59.140 --> 01:13:04.140]   a target date portfolio or a fund of funds
[01:13:04.140 --> 01:13:08.780]   that Vanguard offers and the like.
[01:13:08.780 --> 01:13:10.720]   And Jack, let's face it, I've been wrong.
[01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:13.580]   Jack Bogle has been right on international
[01:13:13.580 --> 01:13:15.260]   continuing to underperform.
[01:13:15.260 --> 01:13:20.860]   - Yeah, again, go ahead now.
[01:13:20.860 --> 01:13:25.180]   - There's a very long thread going right now
[01:13:25.180 --> 01:13:30.180]   on the argument, either the international yes or no.
[01:13:30.180 --> 01:13:35.680]   And there are, I mean, it's really contentious.
[01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:39.140]   The people are dug in one way or the other.
[01:13:39.140 --> 01:13:40.960]   And it might be interesting to follow
[01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:44.680]   because there are a lot of good thoughts on both sides.
[01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:48.380]   So there's not necessarily a right or wrong.
[01:13:48.380 --> 01:13:50.640]   There's what's right for you.
[01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:54.520]   And one of the things that I posted on that thread
[01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:57.800]   was that I think that it's whatever you're comfortable with.
[01:13:57.800 --> 01:14:00.600]   If you are gonna not be a buy and holder
[01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:05.320]   when international goes down, it tanks.
[01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:10.880]   You don't believe in it, that's your choice.
[01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:15.880]   I do believe that Jack was right
[01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:20.200]   and has been proven right.
[01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:23.560]   Personally, I think that for people
[01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:26.480]   who are a little queasy with the do one international,
[01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:29.760]   I think that what Alan touched on a life strategy
[01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:34.760]   or a target date fund might be appropriate.
[01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:36.640]   Because one of the advantages of those
[01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:39.200]   is that you don't see the different element
[01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:41.320]   going down within that portfolio.
[01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:44.160]   You just look at the whole.
[01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:45.600]   And if the whole is doing okay,
[01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:49.240]   you're gonna hang in there even though, excuse me,
[01:14:49.240 --> 01:14:52.800]   even though it's the US that's doing great
[01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:55.640]   and international is not doing so good,
[01:14:55.640 --> 01:14:57.640]   your portfolio is still doing okay.
[01:14:57.640 --> 01:15:01.940]   So I think that that's a good reason to hold
[01:15:01.940 --> 01:15:05.980]   for certain investors, a life strategy or a target date fund.
[01:15:05.980 --> 01:15:08.700]   - And it harnesses the power of inertia
[01:15:08.700 --> 01:15:12.100]   automatically rebalances for you.
[01:15:12.100 --> 01:15:15.380]   And when it comes to international yes or no,
[01:15:15.380 --> 01:15:18.700]   my belief is that it's more important to be consistent.
[01:15:18.700 --> 01:15:23.100]   Back in 2007, when international had tripled,
[01:15:23.100 --> 01:15:25.340]   when US stocks had only doubled,
[01:15:25.340 --> 01:15:27.840]   I saw a lot of portfolios very heavily invested
[01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:28.680]   in international.
[01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:32.640]   Now I'm seeing portfolios very light in international
[01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:36.440]   and performance chasing is alive and well
[01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:38.140]   and we need to be consistent.
[01:15:38.140 --> 01:15:42.320]   I typically go for a third and there's some comfort
[01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:46.840]   between somewhere between Vanguard's 40%
[01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:49.840]   and Jack Bogle's 0%.
[01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:50.800]   (laughs)
[01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:52.200]   - Yeah, sounds good.
[01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:56.280]   There's a question here from Adele Al-Mahdi from Bahrain.
[01:15:56.280 --> 01:15:57.640]   So that's why I love this Zoom stuff.
[01:15:57.640 --> 01:16:01.360]   I don't think you'd be coming from Bahrain to Minnesota
[01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:02.680]   to visit us in person,
[01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:04.960]   but here we can communicate in Zoom.
[01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:06.000]   And he had asked around,
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:09.240]   doesn't a small cap value diversify
[01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:13.000]   because the total stock market is so, like you said,
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.480]   growth in large cap dominating now.
[01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:17.120]   And there's another question I'll combine with this
[01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:19.120]   around the Fama French three model,
[01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:21.560]   tilting to small cap and value,
[01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:24.800]   just not even when you're in a overweighted,
[01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:26.360]   large cap growth environment.
[01:16:26.360 --> 01:16:29.980]   What do you think about tilting for diversification?
[01:16:29.980 --> 01:16:34.120]   - Whenever you pick parts of the market,
[01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:36.240]   you are not diversifying.
[01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:38.920]   You're doing the opposite of diversifying.
[01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:40.640]   You are speculating.
[01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:44.040]   I believe in the Fama French three factor model,
[01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:49.000]   which says that it's compensation for taking on more risk,
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:52.100]   that it's not a free lunch.
[01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:58.680]   So I choose to do an overall portfolio,
[01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:02.520]   which is far more tax efficient, far lower in fees.
[01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:07.560]   So I certainly believe that in the very long run,
[01:17:07.560 --> 01:17:10.480]   certainly almost it's impossible for small cap value
[01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:12.680]   to underperform as much as it has
[01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:14.840]   in the last five or 10 years.
[01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:18.800]   And I do think the odds are it's going to do better,
[01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:22.080]   but it's going to be a whole lot more volatile.
[01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:24.360]   And if you think about it,
[01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:27.360]   if things go wrong in our economy,
[01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:31.280]   it's smaller companies and value companies that are weaker,
[01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:34.280]   and the plunge could be a whole lot worse.
[01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:36.480]   Have I ever mentioned the Taylor Laramore
[01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:38.860]   three fund portfolio was what I recommend?
[01:17:38.860 --> 01:17:41.320]   - That's right.
[01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:44.480]   - I just like to let Jeff and everyone know
[01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:48.820]   that the last questioner from Bahrain
[01:17:48.820 --> 01:17:52.580]   was probably from one of the latest chapters
[01:17:52.580 --> 01:17:53.860]   that we opened up.
[01:17:53.860 --> 01:17:57.880]   But we do have a Boaz local chapter in Bahrain now.
[01:17:57.880 --> 01:18:01.020]   - Yeah, well, that's so great in such a small world.
[01:18:01.020 --> 01:18:03.740]   Here's kind of a nice standalone question for someone.
[01:18:03.740 --> 01:18:05.620]   What's your recommended safe withdrawal rate
[01:18:05.620 --> 01:18:09.560]   for a 65 year old who just retired in today's environment?
[01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:18.020]   - To me, anything above 2% might be speculative,
[01:18:18.180 --> 01:18:21.860]   but so much depends on your family history,
[01:18:21.860 --> 01:18:23.100]   your life expectancy,
[01:18:23.100 --> 01:18:26.940]   based on your own medical conditions and everything else.
[01:18:26.940 --> 01:18:31.940]   I think that 2% you could live forever,
[01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:34.100]   3% might be okay.
[01:18:34.100 --> 01:18:40.440]   I think you have to look at the market valuations now.
[01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:42.340]   It's very high.
[01:18:42.340 --> 01:18:44.900]   We're overdue for a correction.
[01:18:44.900 --> 01:18:47.460]   Whether we'll get it or not is,
[01:18:47.460 --> 01:18:50.860]   when we'll get it is a question, excuse me,
[01:18:50.860 --> 01:18:53.540]   is obviously unknown.
[01:18:53.540 --> 01:18:55.880]   But if somebody wanted to be safe in the early years,
[01:18:55.880 --> 01:18:59.020]   I would say 2% is about as safe as you can get.
[01:18:59.020 --> 01:19:02.020]   3% might work for you.
[01:19:02.020 --> 01:19:03.300]   4% might work for you
[01:19:03.300 --> 01:19:05.940]   if you've got a shorter life expectancy.
[01:19:05.940 --> 01:19:10.980]   That's everything is a guess at this point.
[01:19:10.980 --> 01:19:12.780]   'Cause it would be really great
[01:19:12.780 --> 01:19:14.740]   if we knew how long we were gonna live.
[01:19:14.740 --> 01:19:17.040]   And then we would probably have a heart attack.
[01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:19.340]   - That's right.
[01:19:19.340 --> 01:19:24.340]   I'd say start at a 3%.
[01:19:24.340 --> 01:19:25.820]   If, and only if,
[01:19:25.820 --> 01:19:30.220]   you're an incredibly low cost disciplined investor.
[01:19:30.220 --> 01:19:33.860]   And then there are things that you can do such as,
[01:19:33.860 --> 01:19:36.700]   and David Blanchett, who just left Morningstar,
[01:19:36.700 --> 01:19:39.380]   has done some brilliant work on this.
[01:19:39.380 --> 01:19:41.700]   If you can kind of carve out
[01:19:43.740 --> 01:19:46.100]   what are discretionary and non-discretionary,
[01:19:46.100 --> 01:19:49.100]   what you would cut if the market doesn't perform well,
[01:19:49.100 --> 01:19:52.160]   and then how much of your income is guaranteed,
[01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:54.780]   either through social security or pensions,
[01:19:54.780 --> 01:19:58.180]   that those can then adjust from that 3%,
[01:19:58.180 --> 01:20:00.040]   what you could safely spend.
[01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:01.520]   I'm not a believer in,
[01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:04.060]   if the market doesn't do well,
[01:20:04.060 --> 01:20:05.420]   you don't increase your expenditure.
[01:20:05.420 --> 01:20:08.020]   'Cause then over time you're cutting your lifestyle.
[01:20:08.020 --> 01:20:10.860]   - Okay, good.
[01:20:12.300 --> 01:20:14.140]   Shifting gears here a little bit,
[01:20:14.140 --> 01:20:16.460]   there's some discussion on the chat around global bonds.
[01:20:16.460 --> 01:20:17.580]   And I know Vanguard, I think,
[01:20:17.580 --> 01:20:20.020]   introduced a global or international bond fund,
[01:20:20.020 --> 01:20:21.180]   and they're putting it in, I think,
[01:20:21.180 --> 01:20:23.620]   some of their target retirement funds, maybe.
[01:20:23.620 --> 01:20:26.180]   Maybe I'm speaking out of context here,
[01:20:26.180 --> 01:20:29.260]   but what do you think about global or international bonds?
[01:20:29.260 --> 01:20:33.760]   And is there a spot for that in a U.S. asset allocation?
[01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:38.740]   - I'll let Alan take that because no, I don't like that.
[01:20:38.740 --> 01:20:40.740]   - Yeah, I was lobbied very heavily
[01:20:40.740 --> 01:20:43.900]   when Vanguard came out with it to write about it.
[01:20:43.900 --> 01:20:44.980]   And I did write about it,
[01:20:44.980 --> 01:20:49.740]   but I kind of gave it a ho-hum sort of recommendation.
[01:20:49.740 --> 01:20:53.060]   And their argument is good that if you look at U.S. stocks,
[01:20:53.060 --> 01:20:56.180]   international stocks, U.S. bonds, international bonds,
[01:20:56.180 --> 01:20:59.840]   the largest part of the pie is international bonds.
[01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:02.560]   But international bonds are more expensive.
[01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:06.100]   I agree with Vanguard's hedging of them.
[01:21:06.100 --> 01:21:09.620]   And if you look at the purpose of the bond portfolio,
[01:21:09.620 --> 01:21:13.140]   it's the shock absorber, the stable value,
[01:21:13.140 --> 01:21:16.260]   the what you're gonna have to live on.
[01:21:16.260 --> 01:21:18.620]   And let's face it, most of my bonds,
[01:21:18.620 --> 01:21:21.020]   the vast majority are backed by the U.S. government.
[01:21:21.020 --> 01:21:23.140]   And if the U.S. government goes out of business
[01:21:23.140 --> 01:21:25.060]   and the portfolio is gonna fail.
[01:21:25.060 --> 01:21:26.940]   So I don't see an incredible need
[01:21:26.940 --> 01:21:28.660]   to buy the international bond.
[01:21:28.660 --> 01:21:29.660]   If you're gonna buy it,
[01:21:29.660 --> 01:21:33.240]   I would buy the Vanguard Total International Bond Fund.
[01:21:33.240 --> 01:21:34.680]   And if clients wanna have them,
[01:21:34.680 --> 01:21:36.820]   I'm happy to let them keep it.
[01:21:36.820 --> 01:21:39.480]   - What would be the top percentage of your bonds
[01:21:39.480 --> 01:21:42.060]   you'd recommend in international bonds
[01:21:42.060 --> 01:21:43.560]   if you decide to go that way?
[01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:48.080]   - You know, I've never been asked that question.
[01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:50.180]   So I'm gonna on the fly say,
[01:21:50.180 --> 01:21:54.020]   I certainly wouldn't go more than 10% of a bond portfolio.
[01:21:54.020 --> 01:21:54.860]   - Okay.
[01:21:54.860 --> 01:21:57.740]   - And again, it's high credit quality and it's hedged.
[01:21:57.740 --> 01:21:59.340]   So it's not a bad thing,
[01:21:59.340 --> 01:22:03.860]   but the fees are just a bit higher.
[01:22:03.860 --> 01:22:04.700]   - Okay.
[01:22:04.700 --> 01:22:06.700]   - I think one of the other, the important things too,
[01:22:06.700 --> 01:22:10.720]   is for investors should understand what they're buying.
[01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:14.300]   And I don't think that they would necessarily understand
[01:22:14.300 --> 01:22:15.940]   international bonds.
[01:22:15.940 --> 01:22:19.460]   So I just am not a fan of them.
[01:22:19.460 --> 01:22:20.300]   - Got it.
[01:22:20.300 --> 01:22:21.120]   Okay.
[01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:23.060]   This one came in specifically for Alan.
[01:22:23.060 --> 01:22:25.340]   Can you give us some examples of lower hanging fruit
[01:22:25.340 --> 01:22:26.580]   mentioned in his articles,
[01:22:26.580 --> 01:22:28.740]   recommendations for the current environment?
[01:22:28.740 --> 01:22:31.620]   - Well, you know, like I mentioned,
[01:22:31.620 --> 01:22:33.420]   I'm earning 1% on my cash
[01:22:33.420 --> 01:22:38.260]   versus leaving it at a Vanguard of fidelity at 0.01%.
[01:22:38.260 --> 01:22:40.420]   There are other things like if you have access
[01:22:40.420 --> 01:22:43.580]   to that TIAA traditional with a 3% guarantee
[01:22:43.580 --> 01:22:47.020]   or the G fund, if you're in, you know,
[01:22:47.020 --> 01:22:50.360]   the only thing that makes less sense
[01:22:50.360 --> 01:22:54.500]   than an expensive active fund is an expensive index fund,
[01:22:54.500 --> 01:22:57.140]   which is guaranteed to underperform.
[01:22:57.140 --> 01:22:59.020]   But low hanging fruit is something that I,
[01:22:59.020 --> 01:23:00.900]   or paying down the mortgage,
[01:23:00.900 --> 01:23:04.260]   getting that 2.5% return.
[01:23:04.260 --> 01:23:07.340]   Those are, you know, I define low hanging fruit
[01:23:07.340 --> 01:23:11.140]   as increasing your return without increasing any risk.
[01:23:11.140 --> 01:23:13.340]   So in other words, you're guaranteed,
[01:23:13.340 --> 01:23:16.660]   virtually guaranteed to do better with low hanging fruit.
[01:23:16.660 --> 01:23:19.460]   Don't go with Mercedes Benz financing, you know,
[01:23:19.460 --> 01:23:21.740]   paying 2% on your cash
[01:23:21.740 --> 01:23:23.860]   'cause it's not even backed by Mercedes Benz,
[01:23:23.860 --> 01:23:25.460]   much less a government.
[01:23:25.460 --> 01:23:27.580]   Don't get greedy on those things.
[01:23:27.580 --> 01:23:29.640]   Those aren't low hanging fruit.
[01:23:29.640 --> 01:23:31.940]   The master limited partnerships,
[01:23:31.940 --> 01:23:34.540]   all those things that were just safe.
[01:23:34.540 --> 01:23:35.980]   It's like a toll road.
[01:23:35.980 --> 01:23:39.540]   You know, the oil has to flow through it, et cetera.
[01:23:39.540 --> 01:23:41.540]   Those are not low hanging fruit.
[01:23:41.540 --> 01:23:44.780]   Those are taking on a great amount of risk.
[01:23:44.780 --> 01:23:47.060]   - Okay, great.
[01:23:47.060 --> 01:23:49.060]   So I wanted to ask if you have your own website
[01:23:49.060 --> 01:23:51.900]   and Lady Geek posted to the wiki on your name
[01:23:51.900 --> 01:23:54.020]   and also daretobedull.com
[01:23:54.020 --> 01:23:57.940]   is where you can see Alan's blog posts and so on.
[01:23:57.940 --> 01:23:58.780]   The last question,
[01:23:58.780 --> 01:24:00.440]   'cause we're coming up on our time limit here,
[01:24:00.440 --> 01:24:02.480]   it's gonna be a little, maybe a strange question,
[01:24:02.480 --> 01:24:04.680]   but why not end with a strange question?
[01:24:04.680 --> 01:24:05.760]   What have you learned?
[01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:07.440]   And this is, I think I'd like both of you to answer
[01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:08.260]   if you could.
[01:24:08.260 --> 01:24:09.160]   What have you learned in your life
[01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:11.040]   outside of personal finance
[01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:13.720]   that most helps you with personal finance?
[01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:17.800]   - Boy, that's a good one.
[01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:22.840]   - Without any warning, just throw it out there for you guys.
[01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:25.920]   - I think for me, I learned my lesson in finance
[01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:28.560]   very, very early and my parents
[01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:30.600]   had gone through the depression
[01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:33.560]   and they didn't trust banks.
[01:24:33.560 --> 01:24:38.200]   So I saw the Lindar Bank at home
[01:24:38.200 --> 01:24:40.720]   and I saw my mother budgeting.
[01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:42.960]   Of course, my father worked very hard.
[01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:44.680]   My mother was a homekeeper,
[01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:49.680]   but she had an envelope for every expense
[01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:52.680]   and that was the budget.
[01:24:52.680 --> 01:24:54.840]   So when dad cashed his check,
[01:24:54.840 --> 01:24:56.720]   he would give her the money
[01:24:56.720 --> 01:24:59.840]   and she would put so much in the envelope for food,
[01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:02.120]   so much for the electricity,
[01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:04.360]   so much for the house and so forth.
[01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:07.200]   So I saw that managing your money
[01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:11.600]   and if you got to an envelope,
[01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:13.560]   you didn't have any money left,
[01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:16.320]   you had to readjust the stuff
[01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:18.680]   that you had already put in the previous envelopes.
[01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:21.080]   So I learned that it was very important
[01:25:21.080 --> 01:25:24.040]   to manage your money
[01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:26.520]   and even when you didn't have a lot of it.
[01:25:26.520 --> 01:25:31.520]   And also I learned that you have to save up
[01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:33.680]   for things that you want
[01:25:33.680 --> 01:25:37.180]   and instead of using credit.
[01:25:37.180 --> 01:25:40.000]   When I was in the Marine Corps,
[01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:43.720]   I came home at 18 to buy a car
[01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:45.640]   and my dad had to co-sign for me
[01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:46.800]   and he had no credit
[01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:49.800]   because they had paid cash all his life.
[01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:53.040]   So I learned that when you want something,
[01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:55.440]   you save for it, you work for it.
[01:25:55.440 --> 01:25:59.840]   So to me, that was a very important lesson that I learned
[01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:02.000]   and live by all your means.
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.480]   I think it's lesson number one.
[01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:05.320]   - That's great.
[01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:06.160]   Thanks for that.
[01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:07.000]   That's all good advice.
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.120]   You should write a book or something, Alan.
[01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:10.680]   - Thank you.
[01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:11.520]   - I was kidding.
[01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:13.280]   I said you should write a book with all that advice
[01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:15.520]   and then I'm like, "Oh, yeah."
[01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:18.080]   Any last shots on your side, Alan?
[01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:21.080]   - Yeah, I would say like every Bogle head,
[01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:23.920]   I was born wired to be frugal
[01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:30.800]   and buying things on sale was a good thing.
[01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:34.960]   And when it comes to investing,
[01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:38.080]   those low fees and the rebalancing,
[01:26:38.080 --> 01:26:39.720]   buying after a market plunge,
[01:26:39.720 --> 01:26:43.440]   which I will admit was hard as heck for me to do last March
[01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:46.280]   or every time I have to do that.
[01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:51.240]   But yeah, it's those simple things that being frugal,
[01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:55.640]   buying things on sale, it works in investing as well.
[01:26:55.640 --> 01:26:59.280]   It's not exciting, but it just works.
[01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:02.640]   - Agree 100%, Alan.
[01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:05.080]   - That's great.
[01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:07.600]   I just want to kind of wrap this up
[01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:09.680]   and thank Taylor for popping in there.
[01:27:09.680 --> 01:27:11.120]   We're honored with your presence, Taylor.
[01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:13.200]   It's great to see you.
[01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:15.360]   We'll see you on the forum.
[01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:17.240]   And Mel and Alan specifically,
[01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:18.800]   thanks for your time and energy to this.
[01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:21.840]   This has been an awesome Minnesota Bogle head meeting.
[01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:23.760]   We're thrilled that you took the time
[01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:25.440]   out of a nice weekend to join us.
[01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:27.320]   And it is recorded.
[01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:29.440]   Diana, I think is hovering over the end recording
[01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:31.000]   and then the magic she does.
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:34.520]   And I think we have a zinger at the beginning,
[01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:36.640]   now in the end for these fancy videos
[01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:39.160]   and we'll get them online somehow and back out to people.
[01:27:39.160 --> 01:27:42.920]   So stay tuned for a wrap up with that.
[01:27:42.920 --> 01:27:43.760]   - Thanks, Jeff.
[01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:45.920]   Thanks, Diane, for doing all this.
[01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:47.840]   And Taylor, thank you for being here.
[01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:52.080]   - Alan, I'm honored to be here.
[01:27:52.080 --> 01:27:55.920]   - Awesome, on that, well said.
[01:27:55.920 --> 01:27:57.600]   We will see you next time.
[01:27:57.600 --> 01:28:00.200]   (upbeat music)
[01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:02.800]   (upbeat music)
[01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:05.400]   (upbeat music)
[01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:08.000]   (upbeat music)
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.600]   (upbeat music)
[01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:13.240]   (upbeat music)
[01:28:13.240 --> 01:28:15.820]   (upbeat music)
[01:28:15.820 --> 01:28:18.400]   (upbeat music)
