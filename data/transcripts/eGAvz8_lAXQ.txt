[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.320]   - This week, Randy Alcorn joins us on the telephone.
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.720]   Randy, thank you for setting aside some time
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.160]   to sit in on the Ask Pastor John podcast for a few days.
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.600]   - Well, it's a pleasure, Tony.
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.480]   Great to be with you.
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.640]   - Randy is a friend of ours
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.840]   and a pretty well-known author to boot,
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.240]   and his new book is titled Happiness.
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.360]   It is a book that is encyclopedic.
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.180]   I love it.
[00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.080]   I love those kind of books.
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.940]   And spoiler alert, his new book, Happiness,
[00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.100]   will be my selection for the book of the year 2015,
[00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.580]   for whatever that's worth.
[00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.100]   - Ah, it's worth a lot to me.
[00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.660]   - Well, thank you, Randy.
[00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.860]   It was a very easy choice for me,
[00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.660]   and it's just about everything you ever wanted to know
[00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.540]   about a Christian understanding of happiness,
[00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.300]   as told by scripture and a long line of preachers
[00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.180]   and theologians throughout church history.
[00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.160]   It's really wonderful.
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.220]   I'm grateful for it.
[00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.460]   - Well, thank you.
[00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.300]   - Oh, certainly.
[00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.580]   Randy, as you know, there's a longstanding division
[00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.500]   in Protestant theology that goes something like this.
[00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.880]   Happiness is a bubbly and superficial
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.440]   and circumstantial feeling that comes and goes.
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.640]   Joy, however, is a deep-seated and enduring affection.
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.020]   We see this dichotomy in books,
[00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.100]   and we hear this in sermons all the time.
[00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.100]   Joy and happiness are fundamentally different,
[00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.260]   and yet you wrote your book to refute that discrepancy.
[00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.900]   So in summary fashion, how should Christians rightly think
[00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.140]   about happiness and joy as synonyms?
[00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.940]   - Well, I think the first thing we need to realize
[00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.780]   is that historically there was no such distinction
[00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.660]   in the church and in the English language.
[00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.740]   You simply look up a secular dictionary,
[00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.020]   Webster's Dictionary, and you'll see joy defined
[00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.820]   as happiness, happiness defined as joy.
[00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:52.940]   They're synonyms.
[00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.420]   They have overlapping meanings.
[00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.460]   Biblically, I've asked people,
[00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.700]   "Could you show me any passage that suggests
[00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.900]   "some contrast or even substantial difference
[00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.740]   "between happiness and joy?"
[00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.300]   And there just is no such thing.
[00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.180]   What I did was I used the Logos Bible software
[00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.300]   that we're both familiar with,
[00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.700]   and I went through the Puritans and Spurgeon and Wesley
[00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.960]   and found the words joy and happiness used
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.620]   in close proximity within five, six, seven words
[00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.780]   of each other and found again and again and again,
[00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.500]   they were used synonymously.
[00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.220]   I mean, completely interchangeably.
[00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.580]   Example of that, Jonathan Edwards cites John 15, 11,
[00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.780]   that Jesus' joy might remain in you.
[00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.460]   To prove this point, that quote,
[00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.660]   "The happiness Christ gives to his people
[00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.860]   "is a participation of his own happiness," end quote.
[00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.260]   He didn't have to say, and by happiness,
[00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.060]   I actually mean joy.
[00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.980]   I mean, well, of course that's what he meant.
[00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.640]   And Richard Baxter said, "The day of death
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.980]   "is to true believers a day of happiness and joy."
[00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.780]   And William Law spoke of the happiness of a lively faith,
[00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.340]   a joyful hope.
[00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.920]   And Spurgeon, again and again, he said,
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.040]   "The more often I preach,
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.820]   "the more joy I found in the happy service."
[00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.400]   And he said, "Despite your tribulation,
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.220]   "take full delight in God,
[00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.060]   "your exceeding joy this morning, and be happy in him."
[00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.500]   And he started off one sermon,
[00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.220]   "Oh, cheerful, happy, joyous people,
[00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.060]   "I wish there were more of you.
[00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.500]   "Let the uppermost joy you have
[00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.260]   "always be Jesus Christ himself."
[00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.000]   And then one other Spurgeon,
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.620]   "May you so come, and then may your Christian life
[00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.020]   "be fraught with happiness and overflowing with joy."
[00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:46.700]   So this is just a really recent thing that developed.
[00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.860]   And actually, one of the first people I found
[00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.300]   who really spoke out against happiness
[00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.200]   and contrasted it with joy was Oswald Chambers.
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.420]   And I love Oswald Chambers.
[00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.020]   I mean, "My Atmosphere is Highest,"
[00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.060]   great book and other books that he wrote.
[00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.380]   But it's just pretty startling,
[00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.340]   some of the things that he said
[00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.060]   that were so dramatically anti-happiness.
[00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.420]   But if you look at different Bible translations,
[00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.140]   there's actually more than 100 verses in Scripture
[00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.780]   in various Bible translations.
[00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.380]   Now, I'm not talking about paraphrases like the message,
[00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.220]   but actual Bible translations
[00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.800]   with teams of Hebrew and Greek scholars
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.860]   that also are English experts.
[00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.780]   And then they use happiness and joy together
[00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.260]   in these 100-plus verses.
[00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.940]   And for instance, in the NIV,
[00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.640]   "For the Jews, it was a time of happiness and joy,
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.620]   "gladness and honor," in Esther 8:16,
[00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.780]   or the Holman in Jeremiah 31,
[00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.080]   "I will turn their mourning into joy
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.980]   "and bring happiness out of grief,"
[00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.100]   or the NLT, "Give your father and mother joy.
[00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.740]   "May she who gave you birth be happy."
[00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.300]   And there's just all of these examples
[00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.260]   that go on and on in an English translation.
[00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.880]   "You, O Lord, have made me happy by your work.
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.300]   "I will sing for joy because what you've done,"
[00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.540]   Psalm 92, 4, or Psalm 32, 11,
[00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.100]   "Rejoice in the Lord and be happy, you who are godly."
[00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:19.100]   And so it's just a really false affirmation
[00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:24.060]   that happiness and joy are fundamentally different.
[00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.900]   John Piper writes about this very thing.
[00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.620]   If you have nice little categories
[00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.440]   for joy is what Christians have
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.540]   and happiness is what the world has,
[00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.100]   you can scrap those when you go to the Bible
[00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.140]   because the Bible is indiscriminate
[00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:41.300]   in its uses of the language of happiness and joy
[00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.860]   and contentment and satisfaction.
[00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.940]   And John Erickson Tata says similar things.
[00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.220]   She says, "Scripture uses the terms interchangeably
[00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:53.040]   "along with words like delight, gladness, blessed.
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.580]   "There is no scale of relative spiritual values
[00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.300]   "applied to any of these."
[00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.340]   I just think it's absolutely true
[00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.980]   and it's one of those things that we need to say,
[00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:06.060]   look, don't talk of joy as this unemotional,
[00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.780]   transcendent thing and happiness as this worldly thing
[00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:13.380]   because when we do that, we are pushing people
[00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.820]   who all seek happiness away from the gospel.
[00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:20.860]   Scripture says in the ESV and the NASB both,
[00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:25.860]   translates Isaiah 52.7 in the early context
[00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:30.440]   of Messiah's redemptive work in that great passage,
[00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:35.440]   it calls the gospel, quote, "The good news of happiness."
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.080]   - And you yourself did the lexical work
[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.140]   behind all of this.
[00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:43.060]   I mean, how many Greek and Hebrew terms did you study?
[00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:48.940]   - I think there were about 22 primary Hebrew words
[00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:53.940]   and about 15 primary Greek words, all interchangeable.
[00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:56.380]   I mean, it's just amazing.
[00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:58.420]   You'll have, especially in Hebrew,
[00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:00.860]   in the parallelisms and the Psalms,
[00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.880]   you have these different Hebrew words,
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.500]   sometimes four different Hebrew words
[00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:10.080]   for happiness or gladness used in the same verse.
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.120]   And it's just like we do in English,
[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:17.280]   if we say it's a bright, beautiful, sunny day,
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:19.200]   the sky is blue, we're not saying
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.280]   a bunch of different things,
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.600]   we're saying the same thing in different words.
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.240]   - Yeah.
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:27.240]   You mentioned Oswald Chambers distinguishing happiness
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.560]   from joy and it's problematic, of course.
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:33.720]   His impulse and others is to distinguish Christian joy,
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:36.880]   it seems, from non-Christian happiness.
[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.440]   So if we use the same language of happiness and joy,
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.360]   how do we make this distinction clear
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.200]   between the joy of the Christian
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:46.160]   and the joy of the non-Christian?
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:49.940]   - Well, it's interesting that in Acts 14, 17,
[00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:52.360]   the Apostle Paul, who's speaking to unbelievers,
[00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:54.580]   I think it was at Lystra, said,
[00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:56.600]   "He did not," said of God,
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.720]   "He did not leave himself without a witness,
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:03.780]   "since he did what is good by giving you rain from heaven
[00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:07.280]   "and fruitful seasons and satisfying your hearts
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.440]   "with food and happiness."
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:11.440]   And some translations say gladness,
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:14.200]   they could say joy, whatever.
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.680]   But what he's saying is in God's common grace,
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:22.680]   he gives provisions such as food and even happiness
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:24.760]   to unbelievers.
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:28.000]   So an unbeliever being made in God's image,
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.280]   even under the fall and under the curse,
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:34.200]   can have a certain taste of happiness.
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.560]   So I think what Paul was doing
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:37.360]   was building a bridge to the gospel
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.520]   through identifying God as the universal source of happiness.
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.240]   But yes, of course, there is a significant difference
[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:45.940]   between the happiness of believers and unbelievers.
[00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:51.600]   David spoke of people whose reward is in this life
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.560]   in Psalm 17 and a number of the Psalms,
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:58.320]   and Abraham spoke to the rich man in hell saying,
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:59.980]   "Remember that in your lifetime
[00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:02.240]   "you received your good things."
[00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:07.240]   And what he's saying there is you had your opportunity
[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.520]   and God in his common grace
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:11.080]   gave you an experience of good things,
[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:13.380]   including taste of happiness,
[00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:17.600]   but they are over now that you have died
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:21.800]   because God is the primary source of happiness
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:25.040]   and the world is full of secondary
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.160]   reference points of happiness.
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:31.800]   But even the atheist, when he takes a walk in the woods
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.840]   and sees the beauty and he just marvels at it,
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:38.400]   and he may in his own way celebrate the beauty
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:42.600]   and see a deer and just marvel at this,
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:44.940]   the happiness he is experiencing
[00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:47.280]   is coming from the hand of God.
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:49.400]   The fact that he doesn't believe in God
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.080]   doesn't change the fact that God
[00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:53.360]   is the only source of happiness.
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:56.560]   Tragically, however, if he dies in his atheism
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:58.780]   and he goes to hell,
[00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:00.960]   hell is the one place in the universe
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:05.960]   where God is not present except in his wrath,
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:09.520]   and as a result, he is cut off from happiness.
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:12.240]   So no God, no happiness.
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.120]   No God, no good.
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:18.400]   David Murray, who we both appreciate,
[00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.080]   identifies six different kinds of happiness.
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:23.400]   He talks about nature happiness, social happiness,
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:25.880]   vocational happiness, physical happiness,
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:28.000]   intellectual happiness, humor happiness,
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.680]   and really all of those in God's common grace
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:33.800]   are available except the final one,
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:37.840]   which David calls spiritual happiness.
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:39.880]   And he calls it a joy that at times
[00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:42.000]   contains more pleasure and delight
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.880]   than the other six put together.
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:48.960]   And that's the thing that you can't have
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:51.480]   until your sins are forgiven
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:53.040]   and you are reconciled to God
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:54.680]   and you're made right with him.
[00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:57.400]   And that's why Psalm 32,
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:59.000]   using the Hebrew word asher,
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.500]   a very common word that means happy,
[00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:07.960]   says happy is the man whose sins are forgiven.
[00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:08.920]   And then in verse two,
[00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:12.000]   happy is the one whose transgressions
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.120]   are not counted against him.
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:16.400]   Now you're made right with God,
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:21.400]   you have a deep reality-based happiness.
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:27.640]   It's based upon the truth that you are made right
[00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:29.920]   with the happy God of scripture
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:33.080]   who created you and wired you to be happy.
[00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:36.360]   But up until now, up until your sins are forgiven,
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:39.800]   you've been trying to satisfy your happiness
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.680]   and find it in all of these cul-de-sacs
[00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:47.680]   and dead-end streets, but now you truly found it in God.
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:50.680]   And when you find it in God,
[00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:53.660]   then you can look at nature
[00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:56.320]   and have greater pleasure in it.
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:57.880]   It's what Lewis talked about
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:59.720]   with the first things and the second things.
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:01.180]   If you put the second things first,
[00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:04.280]   then you lose in many ways the value
[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:05.640]   of those second things.
[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:07.640]   But if you put the first things first,
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:10.920]   and the first thing is really the first person who's God,
[00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:14.400]   then everything else falls in place.
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.680]   - Yeah, and as Chesterton said,
[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:19.280]   "The atheist sees beauty, but has no one to thank,
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:22.000]   "thus no one to be happy in."
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.720]   - Yes, exactly.
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:25.180]   - Randy Alcorn, thank you for your time.
[00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:27.040]   We're talking about Randy Alcorn's new book,
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:30.320]   "Happiness," my pick for the book of the year in 2015.
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:31.280]   Check it out tomorrow.
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:33.360]   We return and I'll ask Randy,
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:34.440]   if God is so happy,
[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:38.200]   why does he seem so bad-tempered in the Bible?
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:39.200]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:40.300]   I'll see you tomorrow.
[00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:42.880]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:45.460]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:55.460]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
