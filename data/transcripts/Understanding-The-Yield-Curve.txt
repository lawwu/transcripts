[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai and I thought it would be a good idea to talk
[00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:10.240]   about the yield curve, which I think is one of the best economic predictors. So you may be hearing
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.840]   more about the yield curve lately because the yield curve is flattening out. And I just wanted
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:24.080]   to use this podcast to explain why the yield curve is important and why an inverted yield curve is a
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.760]   clear sign of an upcoming recession. Now some people say, well, this time it's different.
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:36.480]   I want to say that this time is not different because investors are rational. All of us are
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.680]   rational because we want to do things to make us more money and do less of the things that could
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:47.680]   lose us money. The yield curve is a curve on a graph in which the yield of fixed interest securities
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:54.080]   is plotted against the length of time they have to run to maturity. So for example, treasury notes,
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:01:00.080]   you know, one month note, three month note, six month note, 12 month note, those are the short end
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:06.480]   and then the longer end, three year, five year, 10 year, 30 year. So the yield curve is almost
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:12.240]   always upward sloping, which is a sign that the economy is functioning properly. And to best
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.880]   understand the yield curve, all you've got to do is put yourself in the shoes of the lender,
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.400]   the borrower and the investor. Each entity is rational and looking to do what's best for their
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.360]   bottom line. So let's start with the lender's perspective. Due to inflation, the value of a
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.280]   dollar tomorrow is worth less than the value of a dollar today. Hence, in order to profitably lend
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.960]   money, you must charge an interest rate. And the longer the lending term, the higher the interest
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.320]   you should charge, hence the upward slope of the yield curve. Now, if the borrower has a poor credit
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:51.040]   score, is not a Financial Samurai podcast listener, runs an unstable business, has like a three year
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.160]   gap year where he or she had no job, you're probably going to need to charge an even higher
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.920]   rate to account for credit risk. If you can get a borrower to pay back an interest rate higher than
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:08.960]   your competition, you're making a superior economic return. And this is exactly what banks do. They
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:15.920]   have complex models, actuaries, all these people trying to figure out risk, and hopefully they can
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.840]   lend enough money at a high enough volume with a high enough spread to make a profit. So your main
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.480]   source of funding as a bank is from savings deposits. And this is the shortest term. So
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.880]   that's why over the past several years, your money market account only pay like point 1% to point 5%.
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.280]   Banks were loving it because they didn't, they didn't have to pay you the money, they could
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.320]   just pay such a low interest rate. And then they could turn around and lend it for a higher
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:48.080]   interest rate. So that is what a bank does. They take in your deposits, pay you a small rate,
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:54.960]   and hopefully re-lend that money at a higher rate to earn a positive net interest margin gain. So
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:00.560]   the yield curve is upward sloping, banks have an easier time achieving such profitability. Now from
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.640]   a borrower's perspective, a rational borrower is incentivized to borrow as much money as possible
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.960]   for as long a period of time as possible at the lowest interest rate possible to get rich. Now,
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.840]   the more you borrow, the more you will likely invest. And when the borrowing rate is equal to
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:24.160]   or below the inflation rate, a borrower is essentially getting a free loan. So back in
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:33.120]   20 around 14, I was able to lock in an adjustable rate mortgage of 2.375%. And that was great
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:40.080]   because the 10-year bond yield was at about 2.35% as well. It was probably more like around 2.1%.
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:47.760]   But now the 10-year bond yield is at 2.85%. So I've essentially locked in several more years
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:54.560]   of an interest rate that is below inflation. So I'm actually borrowing money for free while the
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.280]   asset price goes up. So that's pretty sweet, right? So the classic borrower example is the
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.880]   homebuyer. After putting 20% down, the buyer borrows the remaining 80%. The lower the interest
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:10.800]   rate, the more inclined the borrower is to take on more debt to buy a bigger and fancier house.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:16.160]   And when homebuyers really needed to stretch, they took out short-term adjustable rate mortgages. So
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.720]   you had a one-year adjustable rate mortgage, three-year and five-year. Those are the most common
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:27.600]   compared to a 30-year fixed loan with higher rates. Now, I've been a proponent of taking out
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:33.600]   an adjustable rate mortgage since 2009. Because if you look at the history of interest rates,
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.720]   they've been going down since the late '80s. So in a declining interest rate environment,
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:44.080]   taking out an arm is an optimal move. But in a rising interest rate environment,
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:50.160]   you may get a little bit squeezed once the arm resets. But I still think we're in a lower-for-
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.080]   longer interest rate environment. It's just recently we've come off from the very lows of
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.800]   the lows, and we're kind of ticking up. But I don't think it's going to go that much higher.
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.040]   So in addition to homebuyers, there are companies, large and small, that borrow money to grow their
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:09.200]   respective businesses. If interest rates are lower at every duration, businesses will tend to borrow
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:16.880]   more, invest more, hire more, and consequently boost GDP growth. So the equation for GDP growth
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:28.240]   is y equals c plus i plus g plus nx. So c is consumer spending, i is investment, g is government
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:35.440]   spending, and nx is net exports. So the i is very important in GDP growth. And when interest rates
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:42.160]   are low, that spurs more investments. Now let's look at the investor's perspective.
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:48.160]   Given the motivations of the borrower and the lender, the investor sees the yield curve as an
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:53.520]   economic indicator. The steeper the yield curve, up to a point, the healthier the economy. I say
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:59.520]   up to a point because if it's super steep and super high, it's probably not a good economic
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.960]   environment because there's inflation, maybe hyperinflation, and higher interest rates will
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:11.840]   choke off growth. The flatter the yield curve, the more cause for concern given the borrower's doubt
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:17.760]   about the near future. So if there's a lack of demand for short-term bonds, pushing short-term
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:23.840]   yields higher, perhaps there is doubt about short-term economic growth. We know that the
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:30.240]   average recession lasts 18 months. So if that's the case, maybe you don't want to really invest
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:36.880]   in anything over the next two years. Similarly, if investor demand for long-term bonds keeps long-term
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:42.320]   yields low, this may mean investors don't believe there are inflationary pressures because the
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:47.840]   economy isn't viewed as trending stronger. If the long-term view of the economy is, you know, even
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:55.280]   tighter job market, even stronger corporate earnings, even more competition, and so forth,
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:00.320]   that's inflationary. And if that's inflationary, people aren't going to want to hold bonds.
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:05.680]   They want to hold assets that inflate with inflation or hopefully faster than inflation.
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:12.320]   Short-term yields are also artificially pushed up by the Federal Reserve since the Fed Fund
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:17.200]   rate is the overnight banking lending rate. And that's the shortest of the short, right?
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:23.280]   Overnight rate. An investor needs to make a calculated guess as to how often and how aggressively
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:28.560]   the Federal Reserve will raise their Fed Funds rate and how the bond market will react to such
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:36.560]   moves. The bond investor wins if inflation comes in below expectations. Inflation comes in below
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:42.960]   expectations when economic growth comes in below expectations. And the stock market investor wins
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:48.240]   if economic growth comes in above expectations, generating stronger corporate earnings growth,
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:53.440]   while interest rates remain at a level high enough to contain faster than expected inflation,
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:08:00.400]   while not choking off investment growth. So the Federal Reserve targets about a 2 to 2.3%
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:08.800]   annual CPI inflation. And whenever it's trending higher than that, they'll tend to raise rates
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:13.280]   further. And when it's trending below that, they'll tend to cut rates. So right now we're
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:19.520]   at about 2%. We're kind of at this natural rate of unemployment and inflation level.
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:23.760]   So I think that's pretty good. But we shall see about the future, because nobody knows except
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:28.720]   for them. And not even they know what the economic future will lie. They're making best case
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:33.280]   guesstimates themselves. So if you look at the yield curve over the past three years, it is
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:39.600]   definitely flattened because the long end has not risen as fast as the short end, right? Because the
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:44.400]   Fed has been raising rates, I think, since end of 2016. So the long end, like the 10-year bond
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:52.880]   yield, for example, did come from a low of about 1.6%, 1.8%, and now it's at about 2.8%. But the
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:58.640]   short end has risen even further, hence the flattening. So if the Fed raises the Fed funds
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:04.880]   rate by another half a percent or 50 basis points in the next 12 months, the yield curve will be
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:11.680]   completely flat, if not inverted by 2019, if long term rates stay the same. And I definitely
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:16.160]   recommend you go over and click to the post and check out these awesome graphs. And with a flat
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:21.520]   yield curve, you're disinclined to lend money over a long duration because the return is too low
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:26.160]   relative to the short end. As a result, you tighten up lending standards and lend to only the most
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:31.120]   creditworthy people. And that's kind of the irony. Over the past five, six, seven years since the
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:37.680]   financial crisis, only the highest creditworthy people got loans, and probably only the people
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:43.360]   who really didn't need a loan got loans, and the most desperate people were shut out. And as a
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:48.080]   lender, you'd rather lend money for as short a time as possible because the interest rate you receive
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:55.280]   is similar to the long end. That makes sense. And shorter lending time horizon is also less risky
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:59.920]   than longer time horizon, right? You don't, it's hard to predict 10 years from now what's going to
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:03.600]   happen. But it's much easier to predict what's going to happen in the next six to 12 months.
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:08.240]   So unfortunately, for borrowers, they think exactly the opposite. The borrowers are less
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:13.280]   inclined to borrow capital short term if the interest rate is very similar to long term
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:17.680]   interest rates. They'd rather borrow at the same rate for a longer time period, but they're often
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:23.520]   shut out due to more stringent lending standards. If the yield curve inverts, or in other words,
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:28.880]   when the short term interest rates are higher than long term interest rates, the rational borrower
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:35.360]   slows or stops his or her borrowing. Only the most desperate, desperate least creditworthy
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:39.520]   borrower takes out a short term loan at a higher interest rate. So just think about all those
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:43.840]   people who are taking out credit card debt, for example, to fund their business or fund their
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:50.400]   consumption, lifestyle. You know, these are kind of desperate folks who are going to be willing to
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:55.840]   pay 15% 20% 25% interest. I mean, that's ridiculous. And credit cards are making a killing.
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:11:00.960]   And also, this is the reason why I don't respect any company that makes money primarily off credit
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:06.240]   card sales or affiliate sales or whatnot. I think it's pretty shady and not really conducive to
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:12.880]   anybody's personal finances. And that's my little spiel there. So this ultimately hurts ends up
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:18.400]   hurting both the lender and the economy long term due to ultimately higher default rates. Right? If
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:23.680]   the least creditworthy people are borrowing because they need to borrow, they're desperate,
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:29.920]   you know, eventually, they're going to default on their loans. And this is going to cause a cascade
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:36.640]   of defaults. You know, if you look at 2007 to 2010, you saw plenty of overstretched mortgage
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:42.560]   debtors, just default short sale go bankrupt. And that really hurt not only themselves,
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:47.760]   but also everybody around them who didn't decide to default. So there will eventually be an
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:54.000]   interest rate inflection point where the borrower not only stops borrowing, but start saving more.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.600]   Right? If the interest rates suddenly went to 10%, and it's probably because inflation is much
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:05.040]   higher, you're probably gonna be like, well, let's start saving a little instead of always investing
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:10.480]   because if I can get 10%, maybe the real rate of return is like 4%. Who knows? That's not bad.
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:16.400]   So with borrowers saving more investment by definition slows down. And you multiply this
[00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:21.280]   action across millions of people throughout the country, and the economy will turn south.
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:27.680]   And that's why I'm saying an inverted yield curve is a great predictor of an economic recession.
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:33.040]   And if you click over to the post, you will see over the past 35 years, within two years of the
[00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:39.760]   yield curve inverting, there was a recession every single time. So there are three times this happened.
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:43.840]   And every single time there was a recession. And when there's a recession, the stock market turns
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:48.320]   down, people lose their jobs, and things are not so good. So in economics and finance, everything
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:53.680]   is rational long term. Investors take action to enrich themselves while doing their best to avoid
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:58.480]   actions that will make them poor. It's kind of like wanting to get rich. If you want to get rich,
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:03.360]   you're not only going to work 40 hours a week, are you? And complain? No, you're going to work
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:07.520]   60 hours, 70 hours, 80 hours, you're going to do double the work to get double the money while you
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:11.040]   still have the energy, you're going to think about ideas, side hustles, you're going to start an
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:16.320]   online business, whatnot. Right? This is rational action. And in finance, economics, everything is
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:21.600]   rational long term. So the tricky part is not forecasting if a recession will happen once the
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:28.800]   yield curve inverts. The tricky part is forecasting when the recession will happen. So my guess is the
[00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:34.000]   Fed raises its Fed funds rate by more than 50 base points over the next 12 months, the yield curve
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:40.080]   will most likely be inverted because the long end continues to stay the same. Therefore, the logical
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:47.440]   conclusion based on history is that a recession will arrive sometime between 2019 and 2020.
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:52.560]   Further, given the asset rise has been larger than ever before, since we're at record highs,
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:58.880]   it wouldn't be a surprise that the correction was also greater than ever before. So yes, definitely,
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:02.160]   absolutely. Banks have taken more measures to shore up their balance sheets, higher tier one
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:07.120]   capital ratio, tightening, you know, lending standards since the last recession. But we
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:13.200]   cannot underestimate greed. And this is banking greed, and also borrowers greed. And we can't
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:18.160]   underestimate the stubbornness of the Fed to over tighten to make sure that inflation gets stamped
[00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:23.520]   out. It's kind of like the bullwhip effect, you can't time it perfectly monetary policy. That's
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:28.480]   why you're always gonna be a little too early or too late. So everyone should be paying attention
[00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:34.640]   to a flattening yield curve over the next six months, definitely into 2019. And take precautionary
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:41.520]   measures to protect their wealth. So get a little bit more defensive in your portfolio, raise some
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:45.680]   cash, you know, cash yields are paying pretty well. And I'm going to talk about this in the next
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:51.920]   episode. It's much better to be a little bit too early protecting yourself than a little too late.
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:57.200]   Because once you want to protect yourself after the downturn hits, there are no bids, you know,
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:01.600]   nobody wants to buy anything, everybody's running for the hills. Thanks so much, everyone. I'd love
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:06.000]   to hear your thoughts. Do you think this time will be different? Will the long end of the yield
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:12.160]   curve begin to steepen as investors sell off safe assets for riskier assets? I don't think so. And
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:16.000]   when do you think the Fed will stop tightening? And when do you think the next recession will
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.240]   arrive? Something to think about, folks.
