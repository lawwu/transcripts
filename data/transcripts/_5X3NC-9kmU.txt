[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.280]   - Is there a way to productively end conversations?
[00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.980]   - Yes. - Work or friends?
[00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:08.140]   - One of my favorite topics
[00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:09.840]   is leaving a lasting first impression.
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.140]   So I think that we talk a lot about
[00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:12.840]   how to make a good first impression,
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.480]   but a lasting impression is just as important.
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.480]   You can have a great meeting,
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.480]   but if it ends a slow, awkward death,
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.280]   just like you're saying like,
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.640]   so yeah, okay, great, talking to you.
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.680]   Yep, mm-hmm, oh, yep, okay, good, and bye.
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.040]   Like that's a horrible, right, last impression.
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.040]   So this can work in person,
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.020]   this can work on video, this can work on the phone.
[00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.280]   The very first thing that you wanna do
[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.380]   if you know that you're heading
[00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.600]   towards the end of interaction
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.760]   is you can use a future mention.
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.880]   So typically when someone mentions a future,
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:40.720]   something in the future,
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.000]   we know that we're about to wrap up.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.680]   So that could be, great,
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.300]   I'll follow up with you on XYZ that we talked about.
[00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.960]   So we kind of instinctively know,
[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.600]   ah, okay, we're getting to wrap up.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.040]   It could be, I hope you have a great time this weekend.
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.000]   I loved hearing about your daughter Safa.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.560]   I hope that's wonderful.
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.640]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:58.920]   of All The Hacks,
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.520]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.280]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I am excited you're here today.
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.800]   Now, last September, I flew out to Austin
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.760]   for one of my favorite conferences, FinCon.
[00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:11.680]   And while I was there,
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.520]   I managed to catch a keynote from Vanessa Van Edwards.
[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.360]   Now, I'd never heard of her before,
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.280]   but I was totally captivated.
[00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.740]   So we spoke after the talk,
[00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.480]   and she agreed to come on the show
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.020]   as soon as she finished writing her next book.
[00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.920]   Well, that book came out yesterday, March 1st,
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.760]   and here she is today.
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.080]   So who is Vanessa?
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.360]   Well, she's the lead investigator at Science of People,
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.440]   a human behavior research lab.
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.880]   She's the best-selling author of "Captivate,"
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.940]   "The Science of Succeeding with People."
[00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.520]   She's taught over half a million people worldwide
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.760]   on how to succeed in business and life
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.560]   by understanding the hidden dynamics of people.
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.680]   And she just published her latest book, "Cues,"
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.480]   "Master the Secret Language of Charismatic Communication."
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.240]   We're gonna talk about how to control
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.160]   and leverage those tiny signals you're sending,
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.600]   from your stance or your facial expression,
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.000]   to your word choice or your vocal tone,
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.520]   to improve your personal and professional relationships.
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.820]   We'll also talk about the science
[00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.920]   behind becoming charismatic,
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.080]   how to optimize even your video call background,
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.640]   and so much more,
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.860]   including her top picks for your next trip to Austin.
[00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.700]   That is a lot to cover, so let's jump in.
[00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.280]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.080]   - Vanessa, thank you so much for being here,
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.360]   and congrats on the book launch.
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.000]   - Oh my goodness, thank you so much for having me.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.160]   It's like we're celebrating.
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.000]   Thank you for having me.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.720]   - So I read the title of the book at first, "Cues,"
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.880]   "Master the Secret Language of Charismatic Communication."
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.480]   I had two reactions.
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.320]   First-- - Tell me.
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.800]   - Yes, please, I wanna master that secret language.
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.840]   But second, and this is my first question for you,
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.640]   what is a cue?
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.280]   - I know, I know, so a cue, very easy,
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.080]   is the social signal we send to each other.
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.360]   So these can be nonverbal, body language,
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.240]   facial expressions, gestures.
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.440]   They can be vocal.
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.160]   That's the one people mostly forget.
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.120]   How we sound, our volume, our pace, our cadence, our accent.
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.760]   Verbal, the words we use.
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.080]   Those are the cues we're most familiar with.
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.640]   And lastly, imagery, colors, fonts, props,
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.400]   what's behind me in my background.
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.560]   Those are all imagery cues.
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.280]   - Wow, and what is the tie between cues
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.160]   and this kind of charisma or charismatic communication?
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.360]   - Yeah, so I have always been fascinated
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.520]   by charismatic people.
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.240]   That's probably because I do not feel
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.920]   very naturally charismatic.
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.520]   I joke that I'm a recovering awkward person,
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.240]   still very much in recovery.
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.440]   And I was the kid on the playground
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.160]   who would kind of watch the cool kids
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.680]   and be like, "Wow, they have that image
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.600]   of cool kids," and be like, "Wow, they have that it factor."
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.600]   And for many years, and I think this is a myth
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.280]   that I'm hoping to bust with this book,
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.080]   is I thought you either were born with it or you weren't.
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.600]   You were either born charismatic or you weren't.
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:59.800]   And what I've come to learn,
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.720]   and what the research also says is no.
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.360]   Actually, charisma absolutely can be learned.
[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.560]   And there is a small percent of the population
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.680]   who are born charismatic.
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.280]   Like out of the womb, they're just entertaining parties
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.680]   and name dropping, and they're super charismatic.
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.560]   But most charismatic people actually develop it over time.
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.480]   And the way that we do this is through our cues.
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.360]   So what I didn't realize is that about 17 years ago,
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.800]   I started to catalog the cues that I was seeing.
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.640]   And at the very beginning, I had no idea
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.280]   this would end up being a book, by the way.
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.320]   I started a little folder on my desktop called Curious Cues.
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.720]   And these were just cues that I was noticing
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.100]   across business, politics, athletics,
[00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.120]   that very highly charismatic people
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.760]   were using the same cues over and over again.
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.040]   It didn't matter their industry,
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.880]   it didn't matter their talent,
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.800]   they were using these cues over and over.
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.920]   And I thought, what are they doing?
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.840]   How is it they captivate us?
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.160]   How is it they can pop onto an interview or come on video
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.360]   and we immediately wanna watch them?
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.360]   So a cue is how charismatic people
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.440]   socially signal their charisma to others.
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.280]   - That's, yes.
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.800]   And I know you've talked in your previous book
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.360]   and a lot about what charisma is.
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.480]   Could you kind of break it down?
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.260]   Because like you've said in the past,
[00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:15.480]   it's something that we all know,
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.480]   but we don't actually have a way to describe.
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.600]   And I think that might be a good starting point.
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.560]   - This is exactly it.
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:25.040]   We feel like charisma is like this mysterious behavior,
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.480]   but actually it's not mysterious at all.
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.000]   There is a formula for charisma.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.320]   And this, by the way, when I read this in the research,
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.660]   it was like relief.
[00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.380]   So what the research finds
[00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.240]   is that highly charismatic people,
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.760]   this is research out of Princeton University
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.600]   from Dr. Susan Fisk,
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.560]   is that highly charismatic people
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.320]   rank off the charts in two specific traits.
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.820]   They have to be both warm and competent.
[00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.080]   So when you meet a highly charismatic person,
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.920]   at the same time, they're signaling likability,
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:56.240]   trust, warmth, collaboration, openness.
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.520]   And at the very same time,
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.560]   they're signaling competence, power,
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.120]   capability, efficiency, productivity.
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.600]   And the reason why highly charismatic people
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:10.160]   are so captivating is they're always hitting that balance.
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.800]   We both wanna be around them and wanna work with them.
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.600]   We both trust them and also take them seriously.
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.500]   That is the formula for charisma.
[00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.480]   - And is there a way someone listening
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.800]   could kind of evaluate where they are?
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.460]   I mean, is it a spectrum?
[00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.360]   Could you not even be on the spectrum?
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.840]   - Yes, it's very much a spectrum.
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.320]   I think that, I like to think of it as sort of a scale.
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:31.400]   So this is what I talk about in the book,
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.640]   is that you can either be highly warm leaning
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.440]   or highly competent leaning.
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.120]   And this is why there's different flavors of charisma.
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.380]   So when you think about warmth and competence,
[00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:43.920]   a way to sort of self-assess
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:45.880]   or give yourself a little audit is,
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.640]   which sounds more like you?
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:48.720]   Ready for a little test?
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.560]   Okay, so is it column A.
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:55.200]   Would people describe you as collaborative,
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:07:00.200]   a team player, patient, compassionate, friendly?
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.080]   That's column A.
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:07.640]   Column B, would people describe you as competent,
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:12.640]   impressive, powerful, efficient, memorable?
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:16.680]   So which column had more like,
[00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.400]   yes, people would describe me as that.
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.240]   So usually people have kind of a leaning, right?
[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:23.160]   They have like more warm, more competent,
[00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.400]   or if you have a mixture of both, amazing.
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.280]   You're one of those very rare birds, highly charismatic.
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.080]   If I read those two lists,
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.360]   I think this is actually more common
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.480]   if we're really honest with ourselves, this was me.
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:34.960]   If I had said those two lists
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.520]   and none of those sounded like you,
[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.360]   you're like, I don't think I can genuinely say
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.580]   that anyone would describe me as those things.
[00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:43.580]   That is okay.
[00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:46.080]   That's where I was when I first started this research.
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.380]   I call that the danger zone.
[00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:50.760]   You're in the danger zone if you don't feel
[00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:53.080]   that you are signaling or cueing
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.720]   either warmth or competence.
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:08:00.620]   And this is the problem of very smart people.
[00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:03.200]   Most of my students, like I think most of your listeners,
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:07.320]   are high-achieving, high-earning, high-performance,
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:10.080]   smart, talented, capable individuals.
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:12.480]   The problem is is that very smart people
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:15.480]   often rely too much on their ideas.
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:16.920]   They know they have really good ideas.
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.200]   They know they have really good training.
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.800]   They know they have really good skills.
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.400]   So they double down on that.
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:22.920]   But the problem is is they don't think
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.600]   about how to communicate those ideas.
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.080]   So they walk into a boardroom,
[00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:28.620]   or they go in a presentation,
[00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:30.760]   or they're asking to raise their rates with clients,
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.000]   or they're asking for a raise from their boss,
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   and they don't understand why the other person
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.760]   doesn't see their smarts.
[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:39.580]   Cues are how we communicate the warmth
[00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:41.080]   and competence of our ideas.
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:46.120]   - Yeah, so I wanna get into getting out of the danger zone,
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:49.560]   and for people who are on either spectrum, how to fix it.
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:52.720]   But I thought a good place to start is could you tell me
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:56.040]   about the cues you brought to this conversation?
[00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.960]   And I'm hoping that by the time this happens,
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.560]   we'll start putting things out on YouTube.
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:01.960]   Maybe someone could watch the video.
[00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:04.200]   If not, stay tuned, it'll happen.
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.920]   But what did you bring to set kind of an example
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:08.840]   of how you wanted to be conveyed?
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.520]   - Sure, so actually, let's start with vocal.
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:11.680]   So for people who are listening
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:13.360]   or watching, this would be helpful.
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.560]   So I know, and the research shows,
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:18.120]   that the way that we say our words,
[00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:21.160]   our vocal power is a very important aspect
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:22.320]   of how people judge our charisma.
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:24.360]   Our vocal cues are really essential
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:27.520]   for communicating both competence and warmth.
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:29.080]   And so a study that I share in the book,
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:32.260]   which I'll share here 'cause I just think it's mind-blowing,
[00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:37.260]   is they had doctors record 10-second voice tone clips.
[00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.000]   So these are short clips where they said their name,
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.220]   where they worked, and their specialty.
[00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:43.160]   So it sounded like this.
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:44.680]   Hi, my name is Dr. Edwards.
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:46.480]   I specialize in oncology,
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:48.680]   and I work at the Children's Hospital.
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:49.720]   Very simple.
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:52.240]   They took these clips, and they warbled the words.
[00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:54.280]   So you could hear the volume, the pace, the cadence,
[00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:57.480]   all the vocal cues, but none of the actual words.
[00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:00.760]   Then they asked participants to listen to these clips
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:04.620]   and rate the doctors on warmth and competence,
[00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:07.460]   the two things that we know are essential for charisma.
[00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:09.200]   What's incredible is, imagine this for a second,
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.160]   you're given a clip of Gobbledygook, right?
[00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.400]   (speaking gibberish)
[00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:14.480]   Like that's how the clips kind of sound,
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.800]   like womp, womp, womp, womp, a little bit,
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:18.120]   like totally distorted.
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.740]   And you're asked, how smart is this person?
[00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:22.080]   How friendly is this person?
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.600]   Like this is based on almost nothing.
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:27.440]   What they found, incredibly,
[00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:30.480]   is the doctors who had the lowest ratings
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.560]   of warmth and competence
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:35.440]   had the highest rate of malpractice lawsuits.
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:39.780]   Now, this indicates, yeah, wow.
[00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:43.560]   We don't just sue doctors based on their skills.
[00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:47.480]   We sue doctors based on our perception of their skills,
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:50.920]   and that happens within the first 10 seconds of hearing them.
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.880]   So, what I brought to this interview,
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:57.520]   I know that the first 10 words out of my mouth,
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:59.240]   not only what the verbal cues are,
[00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:02.040]   but also how I share those first 10 words
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:04.600]   are going to set me up for warmth and competence
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.200]   for the entire interview.
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.240]   And the biggest mistake that I used to make
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:10.640]   that I hear a lot of people make on their video calls
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:13.320]   or on their interviews is they hold their breath,
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:16.320]   and they wait to start,
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:17.880]   and then they say their hello
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:19.400]   on the highest end of their range.
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:24.400]   And they go, "Hello? Oh, hi. Hi. How are ya?"
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:27.680]   And then they go down into their lowest range.
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:31.680]   So, one is when we analyzed video calls
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:32.880]   and the vocal power behind video calls,
[00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:36.480]   often people's highest note was the first word.
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:38.140]   So, make sure, number one,
[00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:40.120]   just as I try to do right when I hopped on,
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:42.460]   is as you were saying hello,
[00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:44.360]   I made sure to speak on the out-breath.
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:47.400]   So, instead of, "Hey, I'm happy to be here,"
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:51.480]   all the way up here, I was, "Hey, I'm so happy to be here."
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:55.200]   Those sound totally different, but they both come from me,
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.320]   and that is simply an effect of breath.
[00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:02.320]   So, one is I made sure I was in the lowest end of my range.
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.400]   And then second, I also made sure that,
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:05.800]   and that's vocal competence.
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:08.120]   So, we are always sitting for lower end of range
[00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:10.360]   for competence to hear,
[00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:13.040]   competence to hear is someone feeling good
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:13.880]   about what they're going to say?
[00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:15.880]   Are they holding their breath? Are they nervous?
[00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:18.400]   And the second thing is I also try to bring vocal warmth.
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:20.800]   So, I truly am grateful to be here.
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.400]   I feel very, very supported by you
[00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:25.640]   in supporting this book launch, and I need your help.
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:27.960]   The only way that I can reach your listeners is with you.
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:30.760]   So, I was keeping that gratitude
[00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:33.720]   at the very front of my brain,
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:37.240]   so that when I said, "I'm so happy to be here,"
[00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:38.880]   you could actually, so if you listen,
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.740]   just if you close your eyes for a second,
[00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:43.760]   or if you're listening, just listen to the vocal power,
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:46.800]   smiles change the timber of our voice.
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.600]   They've actually detected that a smile
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.560]   can change the way that your voice sounds.
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.380]   We can hear a smile.
[00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:53.880]   So, if I were to say, and this is a mistake
[00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:55.440]   that a lot of speakers make,
[00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:58.760]   they say verbal words that are good, but they sound bad.
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:01.240]   So, they'll say, "Yeah, I'm so happy to be here."
[00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:04.600]   Now, verbally, I said, "I'm so happy to be here,"
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:06.280]   but I don't sound very happy.
[00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:08.480]   And someone will hop on a video call and be like,
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:12.040]   "Hey, everyone, so happy to have you all here."
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:14.040]   That doesn't sound very happy.
[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:16.520]   Instinctively, we're like, "No, that doesn't sound
[00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:19.280]   "very happy," whereas I'm gonna smile so you can hear it,
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:21.160]   and I'm gonna smile all the way up into my eyes,
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:23.600]   so an authentic smile reaches all the way up
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:25.640]   into these upper cheek muscles.
[00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:27.840]   So, if I smile all the way with my face,
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:29.400]   all the way up into my upper cheek muscles,
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:32.640]   and I say, "I'm so happy to be here,"
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:33.960]   it sounds different.
[00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.460]   We can literally hear the warmth.
[00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:37.640]   And so, I wanna start to pair,
[00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:39.320]   and that's what I try to do in my interviews,
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:42.280]   is how can we pair our intentions with our cues?
[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:43.600]   That was a long answer.
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:45.400]   - No, no, it was great.
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:47.160]   That's part of what you brought to this.
[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:49.320]   And you said the first 10 words are important,
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:52.240]   and you talked a lot about how to deliver them
[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:54.000]   with your breath, with your intonation,
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.920]   with all that, with smiling.
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:58.180]   What about the actual words?
[00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:02.560]   - Yes, okay, so once you have the nonverbal and vocal down,
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.200]   and that's sort of like a foundation.
[00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:05.480]   That's how I kinda like to think about it,
[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:08.080]   is if you have your nonverbal foundation,
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:09.680]   your vocal foundation down,
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:11.520]   that's a much easier way to deliver
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:12.960]   almost any kind of verbal content.
[00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:15.520]   However, your verbal cues matter.
[00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:17.280]   And so, when we look at verbal cues,
[00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:20.240]   we instinctively all know that our words matter, right?
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:21.080]   Everyone listening can be like,
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:22.960]   "Of course our words matter."
[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.680]   But what I don't think we realize
[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:28.720]   is that our words are cues for behavior.
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:30.880]   In other words, especially as we're doing
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:33.400]   more and more virtual communication,
[00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:36.200]   our brains are constantly hunting,
[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:39.880]   searching for, listening for, how should I act?
[00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:41.320]   How should I behave?
[00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:42.920]   How should I feel?
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:44.120]   And what research has found,
[00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:46.400]   and this is across a lot of different studies,
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:48.440]   and this is kind of a fun one that I'll share.
[00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:51.360]   So Brian Wansink wanted to know
[00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:55.480]   if a verbal cue could change someone's attitude.
[00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:58.480]   What he did was he blindfolded people in his lab
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:00.040]   so they couldn't see anything,
[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:03.240]   and then he gave them a bowl of strawberry yogurt.
[00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:04.920]   So I actually don't even talk about this study in the book
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:06.360]   'cause I think it's so fun.
[00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:07.680]   He gave them a bowl of strawberry yogurt
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:08.880]   and they're blindfolded,
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:11.000]   and he has them eat the strawberry yogurt.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.640]   They're blindfolded, they're eating it.
[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:13.920]   They're tasting their strawberry yogurt.
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:17.000]   And then he asks them to rate the yogurt
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.600]   on its strawberry flavor.
[00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:21.120]   So how strawberry do you feel this yogurt is?
[00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:23.640]   59% of the participants rated the yogurt
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:26.600]   as having a nice strawberry flavor.
[00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:27.960]   There was a catch.
[00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:29.560]   The yogurt was chocolate.
[00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:33.040]   Totally different flavor profile, right?
[00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:35.280]   Like, it wasn't like strawberry and raspberry.
[00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:36.600]   It was like strawberry and chocolate,
[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:38.280]   which tastes totally different.
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:40.360]   This is the first of many studies
[00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:45.360]   that shows that when the brain heard strawberry
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:48.840]   and then was asked to look for strawberry,
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:50.880]   the mouth tasted strawberry.
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:54.840]   Why I think this is important is because, again,
[00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:56.440]   the brain is always looking for cues.
[00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:57.920]   We're always looking for how should we feel?
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:58.760]   How should we taste?
[00:15:58.760 --> 00:15:59.960]   How should we act?
[00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:02.240]   When you set up a calendar invite,
[00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.920]   the first 10 words of that meeting
[00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:06.040]   are the title of the calendar invite.
[00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:08.200]   Like, your meeting started the moment
[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:10.120]   someone invited you to that calendar invite.
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:11.560]   Your meeting started the moment
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:13.000]   someone opened the calendar invite
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.920]   or saw your name in their inbox.
[00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:16.920]   That's the first 10 words they heard.
[00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:18.560]   When someone sees your email,
[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:21.320]   the subject, and maybe the opening line,
[00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:23.560]   that's your verbal first impression.
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:26.400]   And those matter because people are looking for
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:27.840]   what's the flavor?
[00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:29.000]   Is it strawberry?
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.280]   Is it chocolate?
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:31.760]   What should I be searching for?
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:34.000]   And so my argument is,
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.160]   what if we think about how we want someone to feel
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:41.960]   before, during, and after interacting with us?
[00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:43.680]   Do we want them to be warm?
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:48.080]   Do we want to inspire openness and collaboration and trust?
[00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:52.240]   You should be using verbal cues in the warm category.
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:54.400]   So if you want a collaborative meeting,
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:57.520]   call it collab session or team collab.
[00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:00.720]   If you want in an email to trigger more warmth,
[00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:04.160]   say, "Hi, team," or "Hi, friend," or "Hi, partner."
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:06.840]   Those labels are actually cuing people
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:09.120]   to feel, in fact, more collaborative.
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:13.160]   It literally prepares their brain for more collaboration.
[00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:15.200]   On the other side, if you got to get it done,
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:16.680]   right, if you're like, "No, no, no.
[00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:17.520]   "No warmth today.
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:18.400]   "I got to get it done.
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:19.280]   "We got to be competent.
[00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:20.360]   "We got to be productive."
[00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:23.400]   Okay, set people up to be productive, right?
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:25.200]   Call it a goal session.
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:28.080]   Call it 2022 wins, right?
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:30.280]   The more that we use, "Let's be productive.
[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:31.240]   "Let's get it done.
[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:32.560]   "I have an agenda attached.
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:34.880]   "I can't wait to power through this."
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:37.840]   You're actually helping the other person's brain
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:41.200]   get ready to win, to power through,
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:42.840]   to achieve, to be efficient.
[00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:45.200]   And so I think that that's a gift that we can give people,
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:49.400]   that these verbal cues, especially the first 10 words,
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:51.600]   not only help you be more charismatic and purposeful,
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:52.760]   but they're actually setting people up
[00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:54.880]   to be more successful themselves.
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:56.720]   - Yeah, I feel like I'm in a "Choose Your Own Adventure"
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:58.520]   novel where I'm like, "Gosh, there's six places
[00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:00.680]   "I want to go with this conversation."
[00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:02.760]   But I'll pick one. - I kind of love that line too.
[00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:03.600]   - Yeah, I'll pick one. - I love it.
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:05.720]   - And hopefully we'll come back if we need to.
[00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:09.040]   But I noticed that nowadays with all these virtual meetings,
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:11.520]   people show up and the meeting hasn't started
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:13.760]   and you have this banter back and forth.
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:16.720]   And what I hear you saying about verbal cues
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:18.640]   is they're going to set the tone of the meeting.
[00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:21.200]   But I feel like so often the start of it is like,
[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:23.720]   "Ah, you know, it's a long day.
[00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:25.680]   "I got a lot on my plate."
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:27.640]   Is that completely counterproductive
[00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:29.440]   to what we should be doing?
[00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:31.400]   - Okay, thank you for bringing this up
[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:34.680]   because here are my least favorite words
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:35.520]   at the beginning of a meeting.
[00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:36.360]   Are you ready?
[00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:37.760]   Like when I hear these words,
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:41.200]   I want to crumple to the floor and go to sleep, okay?
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:42.680]   Here's what they are.
[00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:44.980]   "We're gonna wait while everyone logs on."
[00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:47.920]   Oh, oh no.
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:52.160]   It's like telling everyone, "Your time isn't valuable.
[00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:53.940]   "My time isn't valuable.
[00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:56.040]   "We're gonna do nothing for the next few minutes
[00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:58.700]   "except worry and check our email."
[00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:03.700]   So one is I want you to work as much as you possibly can
[00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:07.560]   to make those first few minutes productive.
[00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:09.760]   And this doesn't necessarily mean you get started right away
[00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:11.000]   although it can, right?
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.040]   So you can make a rule that when everyone is on,
[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:16.280]   you're starting, like you're not waiting for everyone.
[00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:17.580]   So you can go right into it.
[00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:19.760]   We don't need to have rapport and chit-chat
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:21.160]   to be charismatic, absolutely not.
[00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:24.120]   In fact, competence is about productivity,
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:25.080]   it's about getting things done.
[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:27.640]   So if you want to instill competence,
[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:28.920]   if you're leaning towards competence,
[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:31.280]   you gotta get it done, start right away.
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:34.000]   Like it doesn't have to include rapport.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.720]   Another way of being productive
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:38.400]   is also to have productive rapport.
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:40.400]   Here's what unproductive rapport looks like.
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:43.580]   And this is accidentally happening all over the place,
[00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:45.220]   especially in COVID.
[00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:46.740]   Unproductive rapport building
[00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:48.360]   is when we start off the meeting like this,
[00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:49.600]   we're gonna wait for everyone to get on,
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:51.180]   which unproductive, right?
[00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:52.380]   We're all wasting our time.
[00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:55.520]   And then, gosh, those COVID numbers.
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:20:00.400]   Did you see the terrible storm
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:01.960]   that's happening on the East Coast?
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:04.460]   Oh, it's been so busy, huh?
[00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:09.220]   We accidentally start negative in some of these meetings
[00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:12.300]   and that derails any kind of warmth or competence.
[00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:13.340]   That's danger zone, right?
[00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:15.040]   Danger zone is when you're using words
[00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:19.300]   like stress, busy, complicated, wait,
[00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:21.540]   you're literally triggering people
[00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:25.160]   to think about stress, busy, challenging, wait.
[00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:26.200]   So what I'd rather you do
[00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:27.520]   is if you're gonna have that chit-chat
[00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:29.960]   and let people log on, make it productive.
[00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:32.880]   Start priming people to get in that right mind space.
[00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:34.680]   So this could be,
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:37.440]   anyone doing anything exciting this weekend?
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:39.760]   So at least you're priming for some kind of excitement,
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:41.340]   right, you're doing something.
[00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:44.160]   Or you can say, what's good, guys?
[00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:46.160]   Anything good happening today?
[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:49.520]   So in my team calls, every Tuesday we have a team call,
[00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:52.160]   every single team call, we start with something good.
[00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:54.300]   And the moment everyone logs on,
[00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:55.780]   even if people are straggling in,
[00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:58.240]   whoever's on the call starts with something good.
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:00.180]   And that's been a great exercise
[00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:02.780]   because it's taken unproductive waiting time
[00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:05.300]   into very purposeful rapport building.
[00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:07.320]   It also has changed the nature of waiting
[00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:10.100]   in the sense that a lot of our team members have said,
[00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:11.540]   instead of checking my email
[00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:14.420]   or running through my to-do list before I hop on a call,
[00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:16.460]   I'm thinking about my something good.
[00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:17.580]   I'm like, what's good, what's good?
[00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:19.380]   What happened, what's something fun I can share?
[00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:21.540]   And that becomes a way that we can all celebrate.
[00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:23.500]   It becomes a way that we can all have a win.
[00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:25.100]   I learn about my team members.
[00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:28.460]   And so it's only four minutes at the most,
[00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:31.460]   but it's taken a sort of like feet dragging,
[00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:33.680]   sometimes accidentally negative time
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:36.260]   into purposeful goodness.
[00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:38.740]   And so whatever that means for you, just make it productive.
[00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:40.700]   That can be warm, that can be competent.
[00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:42.300]   I just want it to be purposeful.
[00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:45.100]   - Yeah, and so that's the beginning of the meeting.
[00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:48.340]   I actually think the most awkward time for me,
[00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:49.540]   and maybe this is even true
[00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:51.460]   on like personal phone calls with friends,
[00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:53.620]   is like ending the conversation.
[00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:54.900]   You had a good conversation,
[00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:56.780]   whether it's a meeting or a catch up,
[00:21:56.780 --> 00:21:57.620]   and you're kind of at the end,
[00:21:57.620 --> 00:21:59.940]   and it's like, we don't really have anything to talk about.
[00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:02.140]   I feel like, all right, well, that was good, bye.
[00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:06.980]   Like, is there a way to productively end conversations?
[00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:08.940]   - Yes. - Work or friends?
[00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:12.580]   - Yes, so one of my favorite topics
[00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:14.300]   is leaving a lasting first impression.
[00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:15.260]   So I think that we talk a lot
[00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:17.300]   about how to make a good first impression,
[00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:18.940]   but a lasting impression is just as important.
[00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:19.940]   You can have a great meeting,
[00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:21.900]   but if it ends a slow, awkward death,
[00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:23.700]   just like you're saying like,
[00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:26.100]   so yeah, okay, great, talking to you.
[00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:30.100]   Yep, mm-hmm, oh, yep, okay, good, and bye.
[00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:32.500]   Like, that's a horrible, right, last impression.
[00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:35.260]   So this can work in person, this can work on video,
[00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:36.460]   this can work on the phone.
[00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:37.700]   The very first thing that you wanna do
[00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:38.820]   if you know that you're heading
[00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:40.060]   towards the end of interaction
[00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:42.180]   is you can use a future mention.
[00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:44.340]   So typically when someone mentions a future,
[00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:45.180]   something in the future,
[00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:46.460]   we know that we're about to wrap up.
[00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:48.940]   So that could be, great, I'll follow up with you
[00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:50.740]   on X, Y, Z that we talked about.
[00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:52.420]   So we kind of instinctively know,
[00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:54.060]   ah, okay, we're getting to wrap up.
[00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:56.500]   It could be, I hope you have a great time this weekend.
[00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:58.420]   I loved hearing about your daughter's softball.
[00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:00.180]   I hope that's wonderful.
[00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:02.460]   That could be, well, this has been awesome.
[00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:04.120]   I hope you have a really nice rest of your day.
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:04.960]   Thanks so much for spending
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:06.540]   your Wednesday morning with me.
[00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:08.540]   Right, so it's some kind of future mention there.
[00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:11.020]   We instinctively know that that's a wrap up,
[00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:13.300]   and then it's using,
[00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:14.580]   I don't know if this is an official term,
[00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:16.980]   but I call it the end tone,
[00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:18.780]   like the end tone of voice.
[00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:20.140]   Right, so the end tone of voice,
[00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:21.780]   it's just like what I just said.
[00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:23.400]   So I'm using a tone of voice.
[00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:24.860]   It's like I'm going off.
[00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:26.780]   So if we're in the middle of a conversation,
[00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:27.620]   I'm talking like this,
[00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:28.460]   but if we're wrapping up,
[00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:30.620]   I'm gonna change my tone to sound like this.
[00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:32.300]   Well, this has been great talking.
[00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:33.960]   I've absolutely loved it,
[00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:36.180]   and I'll follow up with everything that we shared,
[00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:38.540]   and thanks so much for your Wednesday morning.
[00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:41.540]   - And you're just cueing. - Like I'm signaling.
[00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:44.940]   - I'm cueing you with that end tone,
[00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:46.660]   and that's a really great way for people to know
[00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:48.820]   that we're wrapping, wrapping, wrapping, wrapping, wrapping,
[00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:49.960]   and we're out.
[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:54.260]   - So we talked a lot about meetings in person,
[00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:55.940]   conversation, verbal.
[00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:58.660]   Does a lot of this also apply to written communication,
[00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:02.160]   whether that's emails or text messages?
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:04.820]   - Yes, so why don't we talk about
[00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:06.340]   the four different aspects of the book?
[00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:07.700]   Obviously, if we're in person,
[00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:09.060]   we can use all four, right?
[00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:12.020]   We can use imagery, the colors we're wearing.
[00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:14.220]   We can use vocal, non-verbal, and verbal.
[00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:16.140]   In email, we're just limiting the amount
[00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:18.020]   of communication modes that we can use
[00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:21.340]   to pretty much just verbal and a little bit of imagery.
[00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:24.000]   I mention imagery 'cause I think it's also a forgotten one,
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.540]   is even fonts have personality.
[00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:28.740]   There are researchers, real researchers,
[00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:31.020]   who have looked at the personality of fonts.
[00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:32.940]   For example, Chris, you wanna do a little game?
[00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:35.620]   - Yeah, I love games.
[00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:40.460]   - What do you think is the least funny font,
[00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:41.700]   according to the research?
[00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:43.000]   Least funny font.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:47.200]   - I'm gonna go with Times New Roman.
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:48.480]   - Okay, that was my guess as well.
[00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:52.660]   Nope, it is ironically Comic Sans.
[00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:56.620]   Comic Sans, called comic least funny font.
[00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:58.880]   They found that when people write things in Comic Sans,
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:00.900]   people do not find it funny, even if the joke's funny.
[00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:05.820]   So even our font can come across in our emails,
[00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:08.200]   including colors, including images
[00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:11.100]   that we might be using in our either graphics or icons.
[00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:13.500]   So sometimes in email, we can have imagery too,
[00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:16.580]   not as much as in person or on a Zoom background.
[00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:18.180]   I'm very purposeful about the props I use
[00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:19.660]   behind me in my videos,
[00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:21.260]   but you can have some of those in emails.
[00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:26.060]   In emails, you have to be cuing people constantly.
[00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:29.940]   An email is so few, it's only one mode of communication,
[00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:31.980]   so you have to be really purposeful with it.
[00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:32.820]   You wanna make sure,
[00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:34.780]   and this is not just about making your emails longer.
[00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:36.140]   The biggest mistake that people make
[00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:39.020]   is they try to be charismatic by adding.
[00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:41.060]   And I don't think that being verbally charismatic
[00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:43.260]   is additive, it's about being purposeful.
[00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:46.020]   So it's using words that trigger something.
[00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:48.400]   I think a lot of our verbal communication
[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:50.380]   has become sterilized, right?
[00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:52.420]   So we send emails that are like,
[00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:54.460]   "Hi, I'm following up the proposal.
[00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:56.100]   "I'll send it to you next week.
[00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:57.660]   "Thanks for the meeting, bye."
[00:25:57.660 --> 00:26:00.140]   Right, like super, super sterile.
[00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:02.860]   Can you swap out even a couple of words
[00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:04.980]   with something that are gonna change people's perception?
[00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:07.260]   And the way that they tested this,
[00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:09.620]   the reason I know that even just a couple
[00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:11.340]   of verbal cues matter, this isn't additive,
[00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:13.060]   it's just being purposeful,
[00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:14.420]   is what the researchers did
[00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:16.100]   is they had people come into their lab
[00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:18.500]   and they split them up into two different groups.
[00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:21.220]   The first group got a set of basic directions
[00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:22.900]   and they had to complete some tasks,
[00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:26.900]   like math problems and some basic intelligence tasks.
[00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:29.460]   The second group had the exact same quiz,
[00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:32.500]   the exact same questions, but in their directions,
[00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:36.280]   they swapped out three or four words
[00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:39.180]   with achievement-oriented words.
[00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:42.140]   So achievement-oriented words are words like win,
[00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:45.300]   succeed, master, achieve, right?
[00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:47.200]   Those are achievement-oriented words.
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:49.200]   They just sprinkled them in, just a couple of swaps,
[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:50.800]   three or four of these words.
[00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:52.060]   They found that the group
[00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:55.140]   that read the achievement-oriented words
[00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:58.860]   did better on the task, which is insane,
[00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:00.300]   if that three or four words can make people
[00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:02.720]   do better on an intelligence test.
[00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:07.100]   They worked harder and longer on the problem set
[00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:08.820]   and they had more motivation,
[00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:12.460]   so they actually enjoyed that problem set more.
[00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:14.560]   The reason I share this is because
[00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:18.820]   if three or four words swapped out in a subject
[00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:21.860]   or your profile, like your LinkedIn profile
[00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:24.820]   or your calendar agenda or the slides behind you
[00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:28.980]   in a presentation, if that can make your folks,
[00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:31.660]   your listeners, feel more motivated,
[00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:33.660]   wouldn't we wanna give them that gift?
[00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:35.900]   Like what a gift that we can give to the world
[00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:39.500]   with our charisma actually makes them more charismatic.
[00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:41.940]   - So what I'm hearing is that you can actually
[00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:44.100]   have a charismatic email
[00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:45.800]   if you have the right balance of words.
[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:47.800]   Is it the same thing, add a little warmth,
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:50.380]   add a little competence to an email?
[00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:52.620]   - Exactly, so here's the hack.
[00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:56.700]   In your subjects, your greeting and your sign-off,
[00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:59.740]   I want you to match the words with your charisma goals.
[00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:02.380]   If you wanna be warm, use warm words, right?
[00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:04.540]   Hi, partner, good morning, team.
[00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:06.800]   So happy to see you all, best, right?
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:09.220]   Signing off best, best is a very warm word.
[00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:11.820]   If you wanna be competent, use competent words
[00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:13.660]   in your opener and your sign-off.
[00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:18.660]   Onwards, let's do this, can't wait to work together.
[00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:22.020]   Those are competent openers and words.
[00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:25.900]   So yes, you can match your charisma goals in your emails.
[00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:28.460]   - And if you wanna kind of come off more charismatic,
[00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:32.860]   as you say, is the goal to balance what's natural for you
[00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:33.680]   with those words?
[00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:36.740]   So if you kind of, at the beginning of this conversation,
[00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:38.500]   you reflected and said, wow,
[00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:40.780]   I'm probably more the competent person,
[00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:42.460]   let's add a little warmth,
[00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:45.700]   or is the goal to put both of them out there
[00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:48.220]   to kind of have a balance in the email?
[00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:51.420]   - Okay, so this is where we get into the advanced tips.
[00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:55.180]   So level one, balance.
[00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:59.100]   So if this is all new to you, I want as balanced as possible.
[00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:00.140]   So a little bit of warm words,
[00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:01.260]   a little bit of competent words.
[00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:03.780]   Same thing, a really easy hack that we can use here
[00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:06.640]   is like on your LinkedIn profile, look at your headline.
[00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:09.980]   Look at the first two sentences of your LinkedIn profile.
[00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:13.660]   Count the number of warm words versus competent words.
[00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:15.080]   Now this is more art than science.
[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:17.620]   So we'll get a little bit more creative here,
[00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:19.460]   but warm words, when I say warm words,
[00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:22.660]   I mean warm words kind of make you feel the warm and fuzzies.
[00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:25.260]   Warm words like collaborate, team, best,
[00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:27.660]   both, together, happy, great.
[00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:28.660]   Those are warm words.
[00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:30.460]   They have more warmth in them.
[00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:32.540]   Competent words are words like efficient,
[00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:35.380]   streamline, chart, data, science, right?
[00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:36.940]   Those are all more competent words.
[00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:38.540]   So a little art, not necessarily science.
[00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:39.980]   Actually, I have a glossary in the book
[00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:42.660]   if you want a more specific list.
[00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:43.860]   I want you to look at your LinkedIn profile
[00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:46.140]   and I want you to count how many warm words,
[00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:48.000]   how many competent words you're using.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.900]   And level one goal is to make it a mix.
[00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:53.340]   So try to have an equal amount of warm words
[00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:54.380]   and competent words.
[00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:56.600]   So even when I was writing the book,
[00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:59.800]   I tried to have a balance of warm and competent words
[00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:01.620]   on the pages that mattered, right?
[00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:05.020]   So in the introduction, in the description behind the book,
[00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:06.160]   in the description on Amazon,
[00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:09.140]   'cause I know that I wanna hit both warm readers
[00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:09.980]   and competent readers.
[00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:11.680]   So I try to have a balance of both
[00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:15.100]   in any and all public-facing things,
[00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:16.700]   including like my slides.
[00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:18.060]   So I give a lot of keynotes.
[00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:21.060]   I have an exact equal balance of warm slides
[00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:22.220]   and competent slides.
[00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:25.540]   My competent slides are graphs and data and research.
[00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:28.100]   And for every single competent slide, I have a warm slide,
[00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:30.980]   a personal story, a funny gif, a joke, right?
[00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:32.140]   So those balance out.
[00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:33.720]   So I try to have that balance.
[00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:37.660]   Level two, and this is for my advanced learners,
[00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:41.340]   is if you are with a VIP, if you're with a boss
[00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:45.100]   or an important client or important customer,
[00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:48.980]   and you really want to respect them charismatically,
[00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:53.420]   you can dial up into their warmth or their competence.
[00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:55.960]   So for example, I have some VIPs in my life
[00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:57.980]   that are super high in competence.
[00:30:57.980 --> 00:31:00.020]   And so to respect and honor them,
[00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:04.020]   when I am engaging with them, I also dial up my competence.
[00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:08.060]   I still use warmth, but I just sort of edge more
[00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:10.580]   into the kind of words and nonverbal that they use
[00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:12.300]   to honor and respect where they're at.
[00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:14.140]   So that's kind of level two.
[00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:16.140]   That's the ninja level.
[00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:18.660]   - I actually, I have a practical application
[00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:20.160]   that I'm now gonna apply this.
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:23.280]   I'm probably more of a warmth writer
[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:25.740]   with an exclamation point at every end of thing,
[00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:29.700]   always signing off best, smiling faces and everything.
[00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:33.180]   But my takeaway is I'm gonna go read like the LinkedIn
[00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:36.580]   profile or the bio on the website and try to figure out,
[00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:38.540]   okay, is this person that I'm about to email
[00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:39.420]   who I don't know?
[00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:40.900]   It's really easy if it's your boss.
[00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:42.780]   You know, is your boss the person that hugs you
[00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:44.740]   when you come in the room, that's super, you know,
[00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:46.900]   always talking about life or are they very, you know,
[00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:48.800]   matter of fact, competent.
[00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:53.020]   But I imagine I could go read the tweets, the blog posts,
[00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:56.260]   the LinkedIn profile, identify who this person is,
[00:31:56.260 --> 00:31:58.220]   and they probably are gonna be less excited
[00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:00.580]   about an email filled with exclamation points
[00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:04.180]   and smiley faces if their entire writing on the internet
[00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:08.860]   is very, you know, charts, percents, data, science.
[00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:09.860]   - Exactly.
[00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:11.700]   So like watching their YouTube video,
[00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:13.980]   watching their Ted talk, looking at their profiles,
[00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:17.180]   matching them as a much, it's a way of literally saying,
[00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:18.940]   I wanna be on your page.
[00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:21.580]   Like I respect you so much that I wanna use your language.
[00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:22.860]   You also made a very good point.
[00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:27.860]   So exclamation points, emojis, and words like yay, fab,
[00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:30.260]   whoop, those are all warm.
[00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:32.340]   So they count as one warm point.
[00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:34.660]   In fact, every exclamation point I count as one warm point.
[00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:36.100]   So if you have three exclamation points,
[00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:38.300]   that's three warm words.
[00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:43.300]   And for my data heads, charts, percent, numbers, or data,
[00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:45.820]   those count as one competent word.
[00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:48.940]   So just consider that when you're doing your little audit
[00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:49.980]   on your profile. - Yeah, you can just score
[00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:52.420]   an email, plus one, minus one, and see where you end up.
[00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:54.780]   - Yeah, so I love people to do a little audit
[00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:56.740]   where I ask them, and you can do this after this call,
[00:32:56.740 --> 00:33:00.940]   is print out your last five important emails
[00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:01.780]   that you sent out.
[00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:03.100]   Whatever five important emails you sent out,
[00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:06.980]   print 'em out, yellow for warm, blue for competent,
[00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:08.380]   and count 'em, right?
[00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:09.780]   Like how are you coming across?
[00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:11.480]   If you have a mostly yellow email,
[00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:13.860]   you are coming across as too highly warm, right?
[00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:15.420]   If you have a mostly blue email,
[00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:17.260]   you are overwhelming them in competence.
[00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:21.700]   And remember, the research shows competence without warmth
[00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:24.000]   leaves people feeling suspicious.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.060]   That is literally what they found,
[00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:26.780]   that people who are super smart,
[00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:28.160]   but don't have enough warmth,
[00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:30.820]   they are less likely to believe your competence.
[00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:32.020]   So all blue is too much competence.
[00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:34.500]   And if you have none at all, so no yellow, no blue,
[00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:36.900]   it means you're under-signaling.
[00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:38.900]   - Okay, I'm gonna do that after this call.
[00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:41.420]   But before that, one thing we didn't talk about
[00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:43.900]   when it comes to non-verbal cues,
[00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:46.100]   what about our hands, what about our backgrounds,
[00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:47.820]   what about that kind of stuff?
[00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:50.100]   - Oh goodness, okay, there's so many things.
[00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:52.500]   So let's talk about backgrounds for a second,
[00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:55.660]   is I think that, first of all,
[00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:57.620]   there is a little bit of early research,
[00:33:57.620 --> 00:33:58.660]   this is kind of a new area,
[00:33:58.660 --> 00:33:59.980]   but there's a little bit of early research
[00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:01.560]   out of Harvard Business Review
[00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:04.860]   that found that virtual backgrounds
[00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:07.580]   that are like blurred or fake
[00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:10.220]   kind of increase our cognitive load.
[00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:12.740]   Our brain wants to see what's behind you.
[00:34:12.740 --> 00:34:14.340]   So if you have a blurred out background
[00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:15.500]   or a fake background,
[00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:18.260]   it's like the other person can't help but be like,
[00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:19.800]   "What's back there?
[00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:22.180]   "What's going on back there?"
[00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:23.020]   You know what I mean?
[00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:26.680]   So one is try not to have a fake background.
[00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:28.620]   Also your hands disappear sometimes.
[00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:29.460]   Have you ever noticed that?
[00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:32.380]   - Yeah, yeah, I can't, I'm personally not a fan
[00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:36.620]   of the blurred, the virtual, it kind of drives me nuts.
[00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:39.240]   - It drives me nuts, I'm so glad you said it.
[00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:40.080]   It drives me nuts.
[00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:41.700]   Like if we could all just stop
[00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:42.700]   having virtual backgrounds,
[00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:44.540]   and the research is beginning to show that as well.
[00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:46.660]   So that's one is I'd rather have it be real.
[00:34:46.660 --> 00:34:50.260]   Two is you can balance your warmth and competence
[00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:51.740]   with your background.
[00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:54.940]   So remember like awards, degrees,
[00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:58.020]   pictures of you with famous people,
[00:34:58.020 --> 00:35:01.220]   those are all, or books, those are all competence cues.
[00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:04.060]   You wanna balance those out with family photos,
[00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:07.740]   a stuffed animal, a game that you put on your desk.
[00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:09.340]   What you put on your desk, what you put on behind you,
[00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:11.020]   those are also sending signals
[00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:12.460]   about your warmth and competence.
[00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:15.040]   Behind me, I have a world map,
[00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:17.020]   and this actually is the second way
[00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:18.900]   that you can think about props.
[00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:20.780]   Teaching aids.
[00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:23.900]   So I've experienced it with a lot of different props
[00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:27.060]   behind me, and one thing that I learned early on
[00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:28.900]   was that I used to have chemicals behind me.
[00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:31.140]   For about two years, I had my favorite social chemicals,
[00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:36.140]   so I had oxytocin, serotonin, and dopamine behind me.
[00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:38.860]   Super high competence, right?
[00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:42.060]   Having chemicals behind me, it was super high in competence,
[00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:44.380]   but it intimidated people.
[00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:46.020]   People were like, "I'm not good at science.
[00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:48.740]   "I failed chemistry, I don't wanna see that."
[00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:51.300]   So I was accidentally turning people off.
[00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:53.980]   Then I decided to do a world map
[00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:56.380]   because I realized the biggest question I was getting
[00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:58.600]   was are these universal?
[00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:00.960]   The funny thing is the moment I put the map behind me,
[00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:03.380]   I stopped getting that question.
[00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:04.220]   - This is amazing.
[00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:05.260]   What does my background say?
[00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:06.100]   Is it neutral?
[00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:06.940]   Is it go anywhere?
[00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:07.780]   - Neutral.
[00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:08.620]   - Okay. - Neutral.
[00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:11.700]   So behind you, you have some black and white images
[00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:12.540]   that look abstract.
[00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:15.260]   So A, I know that this is kind of neutral.
[00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:16.780]   I also see that it's black and white,
[00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:20.140]   so you're trying to not signal anything too big.
[00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:23.140]   In fact, I would think as an interviewer, that's great,
[00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:24.900]   because you're trying to get the focus
[00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:26.500]   to be on the person you're interviewing,
[00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:27.500]   so I kinda love it.
[00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:28.340]   - Oh, great.
[00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:30.140]   This is all just what we had in the house,
[00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:32.220]   so that worked out great.
[00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:33.700]   And hands, anything?
[00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:35.400]   Hands, up, down?
[00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:40.060]   - So hands are a really critical part of our charisma.
[00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:42.420]   I talk about this in my TED Talk if you're,
[00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:45.580]   I do a whole hand gesture demo in my TED Talk
[00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:46.860]   if you're curious about watching it.
[00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:49.460]   What I really want people to understand about gestures
[00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:53.620]   is they are like a nonverbal highlighter.
[00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:57.900]   So gestures add depth of meaning to your words.
[00:36:57.900 --> 00:36:59.220]   So like a highlighter,
[00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:01.500]   you wouldn't wanna highlight an entire page, right?
[00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:03.300]   So I wouldn't wanna just have gestures all the time.
[00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:04.460]   If I have constant gestures,
[00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:06.680]   it's like having a whole page of highlights.
[00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:07.520]   It's too much.
[00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:09.380]   Like our brain can't remember any of them.
[00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:12.500]   What I do want you to think about is how can I add a gesture
[00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:15.160]   to underline or emphasize my words?
[00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:17.280]   So if I'm talking about three things,
[00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:19.020]   I'm gonna hold up three fingers.
[00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:20.660]   If I'm talking about a big idea,
[00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:22.080]   I'm gonna show you how big it is.
[00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:24.740]   I'm gonna hold a big bowling ball big.
[00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:25.660]   That's how big it is.
[00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:27.820]   If something is no big deal, it's really small,
[00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:30.060]   don't worry to my customer or clients, no big deal.
[00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:31.500]   I'm gonna hold up a little tiny thing
[00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:34.000]   that shows look how small that is.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.140]   It sounds sort of silly,
[00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:37.020]   but that actually is a way that our brain
[00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:39.180]   highlights our important points.
[00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:41.540]   So I like to think of gestures as highlighters.
[00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:44.780]   - Okay, I hope this video is out and people can watch it.
[00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:47.300]   I'll link to the TED Talk in the show notes.
[00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:48.640]   In the time we have left,
[00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:51.340]   I wanna do kind of like a rapid fire of a few things
[00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:53.580]   that I know that you've talked about.
[00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:56.300]   And also you mentioned a glossary of words in the book.
[00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:57.220]   I was surprised.
[00:37:57.220 --> 00:37:58.540]   A lot of times you look at books
[00:37:58.540 --> 00:38:00.020]   and it's just a lot of text.
[00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:02.260]   You have like pictures of facial expressions
[00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:03.820]   and how to rate how people are looking.
[00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:05.900]   And so there's actually a lot of like,
[00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:07.060]   it's not just words,
[00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:08.920]   it's stuff that you can't convey all the time.
[00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:10.420]   So it's fantastic.
[00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:11.880]   Definitely check it out.
[00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:13.780]   My rapid fire things.
[00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:15.500]   They're kind of like hacks
[00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:19.140]   that I picked up from you or want to.
[00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:22.440]   What do you do to get someone to stop interrupting you?
[00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:24.460]   - You open your mouth like a fish.
[00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:26.860]   So you can go up.
[00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:28.660]   We know that usually means someone wants to talk.
[00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:31.500]   You can also hold your hand up as like a stop sign.
[00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:32.340]   Like people.
[00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:33.900]   People usually can recognize,
[00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:36.220]   "Oh, they have something they wanna say."
[00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:38.020]   - Yeah, and what about where to sit?
[00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:41.980]   - So where to sit should match your intentions.
[00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:44.340]   So I have a little seating chart in the book
[00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:47.180]   where I break down the Last Supper as an example of seating.
[00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:48.020]   'Cause I just think it's like a,
[00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:50.100]   basically it's a medieval conference table.
[00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:52.380]   Basically it's the Last Supper.
[00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:53.340]   If you're in charge,
[00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:54.460]   if you want people to pay attention,
[00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:57.040]   you wanna be at the head of the table facing the door.
[00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:58.020]   Facing the door.
[00:38:58.020 --> 00:38:59.300]   That's the big one people mistake.
[00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:01.140]   Leaders wanna see faces as they come in
[00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:03.020]   and they wanna see who sneaks out early.
[00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:04.980]   That's usually the leadership position
[00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:06.220]   if you wanna be noticed.
[00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:08.980]   If you want to influence the influencer,
[00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:10.140]   but you don't wanna be in charge,
[00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:11.420]   you wanna sit to their right or their left.
[00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:13.860]   I call those the flanking positions.
[00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:15.660]   If you want to challenge the leader
[00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:19.220]   or you wanna really be seen as taking a strong stance,
[00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:20.740]   you wanna sit opposite the leader
[00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:22.220]   or opposite the person who's leading.
[00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:23.700]   And if you don't wanna be noticed,
[00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:26.180]   you wanna sit along the side out of eyeline.
[00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:30.100]   That was a very, very fast overview of,
[00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:30.940]   I wish I had visuals.
[00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:33.100]   That was a very fast overview of that section.
[00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:34.460]   - Yeah, there are visuals in the book.
[00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:35.500]   So check that out.
[00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:39.020]   Last, total tangent, you live in Austin.
[00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:40.420]   I got three questions.
[00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:41.460]   Best meal?
[00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:43.740]   - Loro.
[00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:45.180]   - Okay, best place for a drink?
[00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:46.620]   - Loro.
[00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:47.820]   I don't really drink.
[00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:48.660]   - Okay.
[00:39:48.660 --> 00:39:50.300]   - So I would say Merritt Coffee.
[00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:51.140]   - Okay, perfect.
[00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:52.980]   I didn't say what kind of drink.
[00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:53.820]   - That's right.
[00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:55.100]   - And then an atypical thing
[00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:57.620]   that someone should see or do in Austin.
[00:39:57.620 --> 00:40:00.460]   - Oh yeah, stand up paddle boarding along Lady Bird Lake.
[00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:03.780]   People forget that we have like a ton of water sports here.
[00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:05.540]   I know people think of Texas as dry,
[00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:06.620]   but stand up paddle boarding
[00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:08.260]   or running along Lady Bird Lake,
[00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:09.620]   oh, the best.
[00:40:09.620 --> 00:40:10.660]   - Yeah, perfect.
[00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:12.300]   So I always like to ask that.
[00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:14.900]   You mentioned that there are some files
[00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:18.220]   and scripts related to cues that you wanna give listeners.
[00:40:18.220 --> 00:40:20.540]   Can you tell me a little bit more about that?
[00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:21.380]   - Yeah, sure.
[00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:24.580]   So if you go to scienceofpeople.com/charisma,
[00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:27.700]   you can actually take the official Charisma Diagnostic.
[00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:29.300]   So we talked about earlier,
[00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:30.860]   how do we know if we're warm or competent?
[00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:32.180]   I have a free diagnostic.
[00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:33.980]   You can take it as many times as you want.
[00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:36.020]   I also have a bunch of the bonus material in there.
[00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:38.340]   So if you go to scienceofpeople.com/charisma,
[00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:40.500]   take the official quiz and bonus,
[00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:43.340]   have someone in your life take it as you.
[00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:44.940]   This is a great way to self-check.
[00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:47.340]   You might think you come across as highly warm
[00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:48.340]   or highly competent,
[00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:49.700]   but what does your colleague say?
[00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:50.520]   What does your partner say?
[00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:52.260]   So screenshot your results
[00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:53.860]   and then have them take it as you
[00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:55.860]   and screenshot the results they got for you.
[00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:58.100]   It is a super interesting self-check.
[00:40:58.100 --> 00:40:59.300]   - I'm literally gonna ask my wife
[00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:00.580]   to do that right after this.
[00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:01.420]   - Gotta do it.
[00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:03.160]   - And like people I work with.
[00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:04.000]   - Yes.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:04.820]   - Okay, so the book's out.
[00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:06.900]   You can get it wherever books are.
[00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:09.300]   Where can people go to learn more about you
[00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:11.420]   and everything you're doing online?
[00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:13.020]   - Yes, and I also read the Audible
[00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:16.020]   and I bring a lot of vocal power to that.
[00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:18.980]   So if you are a listener, please go check that out.
[00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:20.600]   And then scienceofpeople.com
[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:22.720]   is where we have all of our articles.
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:24.480]   And you also can check out my YouTube channel
[00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:27.480]   where I break down cues of Justin Bieber,
[00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:29.600]   The Rock, Princess Diana, Britney Spears.
[00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:31.680]   I have a little fun with what I couldn't get away with
[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:32.520]   in the book.
[00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:34.040]   So if you want some cues breakdowns,
[00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:36.620]   that's my YouTube channel at Vanessa Van Edwards.
[00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:37.640]   - This has been awesome.
[00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:39.480]   Thank you so much for being here.
[00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:41.200]   I really appreciate it.
[00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:42.360]   - Oh, Chris, you're the best.
[00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:44.060]   And thanks everyone for listening.
[00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:45.780]   - All right.
[00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:46.600]   - How was that closed voice?
[00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:47.800]   How was that closed voice?
[00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:48.940]   (laughs)
[00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:50.700]   I'm gonna loop that in.
[00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:51.520]   - Do it.
[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:52.360]   You did it.
[00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:54.940]   (upbeat music)
[00:41:54.940 --> 00:41:57.520]   (upbeat music)
[00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:00.100]   (upbeat music)
[00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:02.680]   (upbeat music)
