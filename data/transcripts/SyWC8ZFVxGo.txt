[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.720]   where we discuss science
[00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.920]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.120]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.320]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.400]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.100]   My guest today is Dr. James Hollis.
[00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.720]   Dr. James Hollis is a Jungian psychoanalyst
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.080]   and author of more than 17 books
[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.080]   about the self, relationships,
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.720]   and how to create the best possible life.
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.400]   Some of the notable titles and topics of those books
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.420]   include "Creating a Life, Finding Your Individual Path,"
[00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.360]   as well as "The Eden Project,
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.180]   In Search of the Magical Other,"
[00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.080]   which as the name suggests is about relationships.
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.080]   He has also written about
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.720]   how to access our most resilient self
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.280]   in the book entitled "Living Between Worlds,
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.240]   Finding Personal Resilience in Changing Times."
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.240]   During today's discussion,
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.280]   Dr. Hollis teaches us what questions we need to ask
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.360]   of ourselves on a regular basis
[00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.160]   in order to best understand who we really are
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.400]   and what we most desire at the level of vocation,
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.320]   romantic relationships, friendship, and family,
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.560]   and indeed in relationship to life's journey.
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.700]   What you'll quickly realize
[00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.800]   during today's discussion with Dr. Hollis
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.120]   is that while yes,
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.400]   he is trained as a Jungian psychoanalyst,
[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.480]   he is also very firmly grounded in practical tools.
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.040]   That is, he teaches us the simple and yet practical tools
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.200]   that we can each and all apply on a daily basis
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.920]   in order to make sure that we are staying
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.360]   on our best path.
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.160]   We discuss how family dynamics that we grew up in
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.760]   as well as trauma and attachment styles
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.640]   combined with our unique gifts
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.960]   and indeed our shadow side as well
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.900]   in order to drive us down particular trajectories in life
[00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.240]   that sometimes lead us where we want to go,
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.000]   but other times lead us astray,
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.680]   and when they do, how to get back on track.
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.160]   Today's conversation with Dr. Hollis is truly a special one
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.400]   in that he rarely does podcast appearances.
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.000]   In fact, we traveled to him to record this podcast.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.620]   That's how motivated I was to be able to sit down with him
[00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.200]   because I'm familiar with his many books
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.880]   and his incredible teachings,
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.200]   but I really wanted to get his knowledge collected
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.440]   in one format, in one place.
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.040]   And what I can promise you is that
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.700]   by the end of today's podcast,
[00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.940]   you will be thinking differently about yourself,
[00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.360]   about the people in your life, and indeed life itself.
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.120]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.840]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.920]   It is however, part of my desire and effort
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.440]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.280]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.400]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.200]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.960]   Our first sponsor is Matina.
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.120]   Matina makes loose-leaf and ready-to-drink yerba mate.
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.800]   Now, I've long been a fan of yerba mate
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.080]   as a source of caffeine,
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.520]   in part because of its high antioxidant content,
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.600]   as well as its ability to elevate glucagon-like peptide one
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.880]   or GLP-1, which leads to a slight appetite-suppressing
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.600]   effect, as well as its ability to regulate blood sugar
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.520]   and possible neuroprotective effects.
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.200]   I also just happen to love the way that yerba mate tastes.
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.440]   I'll sometimes drink it hot by pouring hot water
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.200]   over the loose-leaf yerba mate,
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.160]   and I'm particularly fond these days
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.640]   of drinking the zero-sugar cold brew Matina yerba mate
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:05.720]   that I helped develop.
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.720]   Now, I realize that there are a lot of different brands
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.760]   of loose-leaf and canned and bottled yerba mate out there,
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.960]   but the reason I like Matina the most is first of all,
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.840]   it has absolutely the best taste of all of them.
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.480]   Secondly, they only use organic ingredients,
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.400]   and thirdly, because they offer low-sugar
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.000]   and zero-sugar varieties.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.160]   If you'd like to try Matina,
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.700]   you can go to drinkmatina.com/huberman.
[00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.700]   That's spelled drinkmatina.com/huberman.
[00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.400]   Right now, Matina is offering a free one-pound bag
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.080]   of loose-leaf yerba mate tea and free shipping
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.880]   with the purchase of two cases
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.360]   of their cold brew yerba mate.
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.080]   Again, that's drinkmatina.com/huberman.
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.760]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Juve.
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.960]   Juve makes medical-grade red light therapy devices.
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.060]   Now, if there's one thing that I've consistently emphasized
[00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.320]   on this podcast, it's the incredible impact that light,
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.960]   meaning photons, can have on our mental health
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.000]   and physical health.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.200]   Red and near-infrared light has been shown
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.800]   to have profound effects on improving cellular health,
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.840]   which can help with faster muscle recovery,
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.760]   boosting healthier skin, reducing pain and inflammation,
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.780]   enhancing sleep, and much more.
[00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.360]   What sets Juve apart is that it uses
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.280]   clinically-effective wavelengths,
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.000]   emits a safe and effective dose
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.720]   of red and near-infrared light,
[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.800]   and most importantly, offers the only true medical-grade
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.280]   red light panel available.
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.260]   I personally try to use the handheld Juve Go unit,
[00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.680]   as it's called, every day,
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.780]   and especially when I'm on the road traveling.
[00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:29.840]   If you'd like to try Juve,
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.480]   you can go to juve.com/huberman.
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.800]   That's J-O-O-V-V.com/huberman.
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.560]   Juve is offering an exclusive discount
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.480]   to Huberman Lab Podcast listeners
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.840]   with up to $400 off Juve products.
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.080]   Again, that's juve.com/huberman.
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.200]   Today's episode is also brought to us by BetterHelp.
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.000]   BetterHelp offers professional therapy
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.920]   with a licensed therapist carried out online.
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.620]   I've been going to therapy for well over 30 years.
[00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.080]   Initially, I didn't have a choice.
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.520]   It was a condition of being allowed to stay in school,
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.120]   but pretty soon I realized
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.940]   that therapy is extremely valuable.
[00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.240]   In fact, I consider doing regular therapy
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.000]   just as important as getting regular exercise,
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.320]   including cardiovascular exercise and resistance training,
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.400]   which, of course, I also do every week.
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.360]   The reason I know therapy is so valuable
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.100]   is that if you can find a therapist
[00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.720]   with whom you can develop a really good rapport,
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.000]   you not only get terrific support
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.940]   for some of the challenges in your life,
[00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.560]   but you also can derive tremendous insights
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.680]   from that therapy,
[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.440]   insights that can allow you to better
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.120]   not just your emotional life and your relationship life,
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.400]   but of course, also the relationship to yourself
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.000]   and to your professional life,
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.720]   to all sorts of career goals.
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.960]   In fact, I see therapy as one of the key components
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.680]   for meshing together all aspects of one's life
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.560]   and being able to really direct one's focus and attention
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.280]   toward what really matters.
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:47.480]   If you'd like to try BetterHelp,
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.960]   go to betterhelp.com/huberman
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.600]   to get 10% off your first month.
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.640]   Again, that's betterhelp.com/huberman.
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.880]   And now for my discussion with Dr. James Hollis.
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:59.120]   Dr. James Hollis,
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.160]   such a honor and a pleasure to sit down with you.
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.120]   I'm a huge fan of your writing
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.160]   and I'm excited to talk to you today.
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:06.980]   - Thank you, Andrew.
[00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:08.280]   It's a privilege to be with you.
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.800]   - Thank you.
[00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.520]   - Let's talk about the self.
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.040]   This is something that I think people occasionally
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.000]   wonder about, you know, who am I?
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   We wake up every day,
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.040]   we have some stable representation of who we are
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.420]   in our name most of the time.
[00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:27.160]   And we develop a self,
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:31.300]   a story based on what we know about our parents,
[00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.520]   our siblings, our life.
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:37.960]   From the perspective of Jungian psychology,
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.660]   maybe psychology generally,
[00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.480]   how should we think about ourselves?
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:43.320]   - Well, first of all,
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.800]   the idea of the self with a capital S
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.320]   to distinguish it from the ego consciousness,
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.680]   that is to say my conscious presence
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:52.580]   as you and I are talking right now,
[00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:57.180]   is a transcendent other, it's a mystery.
[00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:00.680]   It's essentially governed by our instincts.
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.960]   You know, it's nature seeking its own expression
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.680]   and its own healing.
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.280]   What I've seen in terms of the activity of the self
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.760]   through the years, it has two agendas.
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.400]   One, healing when injured,
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.500]   and secondly, expressing itself
[00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:17.000]   in the same way that the acorn becomes the oak tree,
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:17.840]   so to speak.
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.960]   Now the ego, of course,
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:24.100]   is that little scintilla of energy
[00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:26.240]   that begins to cluster.
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.720]   We're born without an ego,
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:31.340]   but then there's several shards of experience
[00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:33.700]   between the me and the not me
[00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:36.680]   that slowly accumulate almost in tidal pools
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.800]   so that I begin to differentiate myself from the other,
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.520]   my mother, let's say, or my father,
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.180]   or the object that is there.
[00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:45.800]   And you're right.
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.240]   We are an animal that seeks to understand
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.240]   as part of our adaptation to the world,
[00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.740]   and so we are narrative animals.
[00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:55.640]   We create stories about it,
[00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:58.680]   and our stories rise out of what we're experiencing
[00:07:58.680 --> 00:07:59.520]   at the moment.
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:03.240]   So you can see why a person born into a certain culture
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:04.960]   or a certain family of origin
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.260]   with its style of relating,
[00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.200]   or disrelating as the case may be,
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:12.260]   becomes the ground for defining
[00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:13.880]   that person's sense of self.
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.240]   So it's important to distinguish
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:18.200]   between the self and one's sense of self.
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.680]   The sense of self is who I think I am.
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:24.040]   In any given moment, that's very fluid, of course.
[00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:27.080]   Now we have all kinds of internal clusters of energy
[00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:28.560]   that are called complexes,
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:30.880]   a term that Jung popularized.
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:34.700]   And complexes are splinter personalities.
[00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:36.880]   He said, so a person might say,
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:39.320]   why did I get so upset yesterday?
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.660]   What came over me?
[00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:42.320]   Or I don't know what I was thinking
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.920]   when I made this important decision.
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:46.560]   And that's our recognition
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:49.320]   that we were in an altered state at that moment,
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:52.920]   that something within us had been triggered,
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.840]   had sufficient energy to come up,
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:58.060]   usurp ego consciousness, and take it over.
[00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:00.560]   Actually, the term that Jung used in German
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:01.760]   meant possession.
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:05.240]   It's a state of psychic possession, temporarily.
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.720]   You know, we joke that lovers are fools,
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.020]   or lovers are blind.
[00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:11.000]   So we know that people are in a certain,
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.600]   they're caught in a certain projection onto the other.
[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:18.960]   And, you know, that ultimately gets, you know,
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:22.040]   resolved into some sort of reality through time
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:25.440]   and experience with that individual.
[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.840]   But in that state of being,
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:31.120]   one senses that one's making the right decision.
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:34.840]   And no one wakes in the morning and says, for example,
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.560]   well, today I think I'm gonna do the same stupid,
[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:39.800]   counterproductive things I've done for decades,
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.220]   but there's a good chance we will.
[00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:43.060]   Why?
[00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:46.080]   Because we have certain clusters of energy in us
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:48.360]   that are regularly triggered.
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:51.560]   When triggered, they catalyze a response in the ego
[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.720]   that enacts that program.
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:57.160]   So it affects our body, it affects our script,
[00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:01.200]   and of course it affects our perception of self and world.
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:04.900]   So, you know, from the standpoint of therapy,
[00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:08.740]   one of the things we try to do is suggest to people,
[00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:10.200]   you're not what happened to you.
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.580]   Because one of our tendencies
[00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:16.200]   is to internalize whatever's happening to us.
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.520]   And thinking of that defines us.
[00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:22.180]   Of course, the younger, the more, less formed we are,
[00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:24.520]   the more we're likely to be defined by poverty,
[00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:28.640]   or by disease, or by alcoholism, or by sexism,
[00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:31.240]   or whatever the social constructs are
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.500]   into which we're born,
[00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:36.220]   as well as the psychodynamics of the family of origin.
[00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:38.800]   So in those circumstances,
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:42.000]   we all have a provisional sense of self.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.540]   And if you have a culture that says, this is who you are,
[00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:48.140]   this is what your orders are, your marching orders,
[00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:49.800]   here's your script,
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.720]   and the more authoritarian the culture,
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:56.120]   or the more traumatic one's environmental situation
[00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:57.120]   in the family of origin,
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:00.200]   the more likely I'm gonna be reacting to that.
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:01.680]   So when I've had an experience,
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:03.400]   I'm either going to repeat it,
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.080]   or I'm gonna try to run from it,
[00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:07.400]   or maybe I'll be spending my life
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:11.240]   trying to treat it in some way that I'm not aware of.
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:14.720]   This activates many people
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.720]   into the healing professions, by the way,
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:20.880]   whether it's clergy, nursing, therapy, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:23.400]   That that's often a sensitive child in the family
[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:26.840]   who feels, I have to try to stabilize my environment
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:31.840]   in order to sort of get things back to a normal state,
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:34.560]   whatever that might be,
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.320]   so that then it can be there for me.
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.680]   But of course, that never quite happens.
[00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:42.200]   You know, a child can't fix a parent, you see.
[00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.880]   And so many people in the helping professions
[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:49.840]   are driven there by a powerful internalized message,
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:52.560]   which becomes their sense of self.
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:54.040]   So it's a long-winded way of saying
[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:56.200]   there's a distinction between the self,
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:59.640]   which is the natural organic development of this organism.
[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:02.560]   You know, as we're speaking, it's growing our toenails,
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:04.400]   digesting our breakfast,
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:07.040]   mentating, emoting, and so forth.
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:09.840]   Most of that's autonomous activity.
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:10.960]   It's kind of like the centipede.
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:12.840]   You know, you congratulate the centipede
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:14.760]   on how well he coordinates all of his legs,
[00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:16.040]   and then he thinks, well,
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:18.000]   should I move this leg, or this leg, or this,
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.720]   and he's immobilized.
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:22.680]   These are not functions that we govern consciously,
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:25.400]   although we can interrupt them consciously.
[00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:27.760]   But something is there taking care of us.
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:29.280]   It's an organic unity,
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:33.100]   and that's what Jung meant by the self, capital S.
[00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:35.840]   Our sense of self is a different matter.
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:39.320]   And so one of the things that I've tried to emphasize
[00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:42.380]   in therapy is you're not what happened to you,
[00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:45.400]   because we tend to be bound to our story
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:47.880]   that says either that's who I am,
[00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:49.600]   that's what I'm defined by,
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:52.480]   or I'm spending my life trying to differentiate myself
[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:55.480]   from that, get away from that, perhaps.
[00:12:55.480 --> 00:13:00.440]   So again, our sense of self is very provisional.
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:03.040]   It evolves, and in any given moment,
[00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:06.680]   there may be something in the unconscious that's triggered.
[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:08.240]   And of course, the problem with the unconscious,
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:09.820]   it's unconscious.
[00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:12.320]   So I don't know that it's happened.
[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:15.680]   I have the unconscious triggered.
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:20.200]   It has the power to rise, take over provisionally,
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:23.640]   spin out its program, and then after a while,
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:26.120]   it recedes back into the unconscious.
[00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:28.560]   And as I said, sometimes people will stop and say,
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:31.000]   "Well, I wonder what was behind that decision,"
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.480]   or, "Why did I choose that path?"
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:34.520]   Or, "What in me is blocking me
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:37.240]   "from doing what I know is right for me?"
[00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:39.760]   You know, as Paul said in the letter to the Romans,
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:41.880]   "Though I know the good, I do not do the good."
[00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:43.480]   Well, why not?
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:47.560]   Well, he saw it as insufficiency of will,
[00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:49.280]   but we know it's more than that.
[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:52.240]   We know that there are unconscious factors at work
[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:54.680]   that have a certain autonomy,
[00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:56.220]   and the more unconscious they are,
[00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:58.480]   the greater their autonomy will prove to be.
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:02.840]   - If they are unconscious and they're driving us
[00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:07.840]   sometimes into states, other times traits,
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:10.400]   I mean, and that's perhaps an interesting discussion
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.160]   in and of itself is, you know,
[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:14.520]   what's the difference between a state of mind
[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.040]   and body and a trait?
[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:18.920]   But if it's unconscious,
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:22.600]   what chance do we stand to overcome these things?
[00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:27.000]   I mean, where, how does the awareness come about?
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.140]   Can we do it on our own?
[00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:31.440]   Does it require reflection from a trained professional?
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:36.440]   And if so, you know, when we become conscious of something,
[00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:39.520]   does that immediately flip a switch,
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:43.640]   or does it require constant returning to, you know,
[00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:47.820]   seeing and, you know, forcing the unconscious
[00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:49.480]   to become conscious over and over again?
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:52.520]   - Sure, well, those are great questions.
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:55.560]   First of all, again, none of us rises saying
[00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:57.560]   we're going to be counterproductive today,
[00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:59.900]   but we will because of the autonomy
[00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:02.140]   of those clusters of energy within us.
[00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:05.600]   Now, I've said to many people who've asked that question,
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:07.600]   well, start with your own life.
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:10.120]   Look to the patterns that you have.
[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:15.120]   A pattern is an indication of some cluster of energy,
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:18.200]   whether it's outward or whether it's inward
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:20.160]   that you're carrying with you.
[00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:22.400]   And we don't do crazy things.
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:24.920]   We always do logical things.
[00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:28.480]   If we understand that what we're in service to
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:30.640]   intrapsychically, I'll give you an example.
[00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:32.720]   I was working in a closed ward of a hospital
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:35.640]   many decades ago, and it was a fellow
[00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:37.440]   repeatedly trying to break a window.
[00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.480]   People were assuming he was trying to escape
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:42.560]   or get a shard of glass for some nefarious purpose.
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:46.200]   And no one bothered to ask him why he was doing this.
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:49.520]   And he said he had the delusion that he was,
[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:50.760]   first of all, in a locked ward,
[00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:55.120]   so he was caught in a, you know, a non-voluntary situation.
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:59.440]   And in his psychosis, he felt that
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:02.160]   somebody was pumping air from the room.
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.440]   Now, if this door was locked and the air
[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:05.680]   is being pumped out of this room,
[00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:07.520]   the most logical thing we would do
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:10.840]   is break through a window or break down the door.
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:13.600]   So his behavior was logical based on a premise.
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:16.360]   Now, the premise is often inaccurate
[00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:18.800]   or tied to one place but gets extrapolated
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:21.000]   to another one somewhere else.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.720]   And then we are responding logically to that premise.
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:27.600]   So you start with your own life,
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.640]   particularly the places where you find
[00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:32.480]   these are self-defeating behaviors
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:36.080]   or behaviors that are hurtful to you and someone else.
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:39.320]   And then you say, since that's not my conscious intention,
[00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:42.320]   and yet there it is as part of my history,
[00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:45.600]   then I have to say, all right, what is it within me
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:48.280]   that, you know, has the kind of power
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:51.200]   to take over my ego consciousness?
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:52.880]   Now, just to back off for a moment here,
[00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:56.760]   I think we're only conscious in the ego
[00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:00.400]   dealing with reality a few times during a course of a day.
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:03.640]   My favorite analogy is when you get up in the morning
[00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:06.560]   and you step in the shower, it's too hot or too cold,
[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:08.200]   so you change the water temperature.
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.120]   Well, that's the ego in its proper function.
[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:12.760]   It's being adaptive to its reality.
[00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:14.640]   It's being protective at that moment.
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:18.080]   It's achieving the optimum situation for you.
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:19.520]   But from the rest of time on,
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:22.700]   when that same ego is flooded by other material,
[00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:24.080]   some of which is conscious,
[00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:26.600]   who gets the kids today after school,
[00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:29.080]   how do I get to the work on time, et cetera,
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:31.080]   but underneath that are other drivers
[00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:33.400]   that have to do with fear-based responses
[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:38.400]   or adaptive responses that were perhaps once protective,
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:41.200]   but later, you know, we weren't born with them,
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.200]   but we acquired them along life's highway.
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.080]   So what was once protective
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:47.000]   often becomes constrictive later
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.560]   and creates those patterns.
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:52.500]   So number one, you start with your patterns.
[00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:57.720]   Secondly, and everyone sort of laughs at this,
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:59.080]   but there's a certain truth is
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:00.760]   you might talk to those around you,
[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:04.040]   such as your spouse or your closest partner
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:08.720]   or your children, and ask them about what they see in us,
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:11.720]   if you can bear to hear what they have to say,
[00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:15.120]   and to say, "Where is it you see me being hurtful
[00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:16.360]   "to myself or others?"
[00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:18.220]   Or, "Where is it that I get in your face
[00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:20.280]   "in an inappropriate way?"
[00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:23.880]   And then we usually have something to inform us with.
[00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:26.400]   Thirdly, we pay attention to our dreams
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:29.240]   because we don't choose to dream,
[00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:30.500]   but sleep research tells us
[00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:32.680]   that we average about six dreams per night,
[00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:33.900]   and that's a lot of activity.
[00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:37.280]   Nature doesn't waste energy, it's processing something.
[00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:39.200]   And it's not just processing.
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:41.420]   If we pay attention over time,
[00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:45.460]   you begin to realize it has a point of view.
[00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:49.400]   Another way of putting this is the psyche,
[00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:51.400]   which is the term I would use here,
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:54.360]   and that's the Greek word for soul, by the way.
[00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:58.920]   The psyche has its own intentionality.
[00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:02.460]   It's omnipresent, and it's commenting.
[00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:05.160]   And it comments in terms of our feeling function.
[00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:07.240]   You don't choose your feelings.
[00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:10.500]   Feelings are autonomous responses to what has happened.
[00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:13.900]   You can repress them, suppress them, anesthetize them,
[00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:17.360]   project them onto others, but you are, in the end,
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:22.840]   a creature that has an autonomous feeling response.
[00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:25.240]   Secondly, we have energy systems.
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:27.680]   If I'm doing what's right for me, the energy's there.
[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:29.480]   The flow is there.
[00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:32.400]   We can mobilize our energy, and we have to in life
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:34.700]   to get up and feed the baby at two in the morning,
[00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:38.720]   or put in our 40-hour week,
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:41.160]   or whatever the requirements are.
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:46.080]   But over time, forcing the energy system leads, as we know,
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:49.920]   to boredom and burnout, and ultimately depression,
[00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:52.420]   often with self-medication attached to that.
[00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:56.080]   Thirdly, we have dreams, which comment.
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:20:01.940]   Fourthly, most importantly, is the question of meaning.
[00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:04.020]   If what we're doing is meaningful,
[00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:07.640]   as understood by the psyche, it will support us,
[00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:12.120]   even in the face of suffering and sacrifice and so forth.
[00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:16.400]   If what we're doing is wrong, as seen by the psyche,
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:19.480]   then over time, it begins to pathologize.
[00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:22.940]   So you take that word psychopathology,
[00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:24.560]   literally from the Greek, it means
[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:27.080]   the expression of the suffering of the soul,
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:30.320]   which I think is reflatory,
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:33.580]   the expression of the suffering of the soul.
[00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:38.580]   Now, that seems to me obligatory to take seriously.
[00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:43.060]   If my soul, and again, that's a metaphor, you know,
[00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:45.640]   people look for the soul throughout history,
[00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:48.760]   and you can't find it in the pineal gland, for example.
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:51.580]   The soul's a metaphor for the organic wisdom
[00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:55.400]   of that natural being that we are.
[00:20:55.400 --> 00:21:00.400]   The soul is a metaphor for this purposeful expression
[00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:02.000]   of the organism.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.960]   It is purposeful.
[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:08.520]   In other words, a question that occupies all of us
[00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:11.260]   in childhood, and throughout the first half of life,
[00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:14.560]   at least, if not an entire lifetime,
[00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:16.000]   is what does the world want of me?
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.360]   What do my parents want from me?
[00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:19.080]   What do my school teacher want me?
[00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:21.480]   What do the playmates expect of me?
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:22.920]   What does the partner want from me?
[00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:24.060]   What does the employer want?
[00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:26.980]   All of these are reality-based encounters
[00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:29.600]   with the demands of the environment,
[00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:31.200]   and part of what we have to do
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:32.720]   is develop enough ego strength
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:35.080]   to create a provisional sense of self,
[00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:37.440]   and a provisional functional self,
[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:39.820]   to deal with those expectations.
[00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:41.440]   But then when you've done that,
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:43.400]   you know, why are you still here?
[00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:44.220]   What's the purpose?
[00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:47.440]   Are you simply here to be a creature of adaptations?
[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:48.860]   Now, without those adaptations,
[00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:50.880]   we would be overwhelmed, typically,
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:52.680]   by the circumstances of our lives,
[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:54.800]   so we accommodate them in some way.
[00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:57.660]   But in the second half of life,
[00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:00.060]   and I'm using that term very loosely,
[00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:04.640]   the real question is, what does the soul want of me?
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:06.560]   You know, what does the psyche want of me?
[00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:08.560]   And that's a different question.
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:10.400]   Then the issue comes up,
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:12.320]   what is it that is wishing expression
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:13.640]   in the world through me?
[00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:14.860]   That's a different question
[00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:17.320]   than what does the world ask of me?
[00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:20.160]   The people that we would most admire in history
[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:25.160]   are people who, in some way, found and lived out
[00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:27.880]   what the soul was asking of them.
[00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:29.600]   It didn't spare them from suffering,
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:31.640]   sometimes even martyrdom.
[00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:35.200]   It doesn't spare you from conflict and pain,
[00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:38.560]   maybe isolation, maybe exile,
[00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:42.520]   but you're fed by the purposefulness of it.
[00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:44.920]   Take that away, and life is pretty empty.
[00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:47.400]   And of course, we live in a culture
[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:52.280]   where there's this enormous barrage of external stimuli.
[00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:55.960]   Well, buy this, purchase that, do this or that,
[00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:57.600]   the latest thing, and this or that,
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:00.040]   the newest shiny thing.
[00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:03.480]   And the more I'm seeking to define myself
[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:06.360]   through that environmental summons,
[00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:08.000]   the more likely I'm gonna be estranged
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.940]   from something inside.
[00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:12.820]   All of us know it, but we don't know what to do about that
[00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:14.340]   at some level.
[00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:17.020]   And typically, it has to hurt enough inside
[00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:19.420]   to bring a person into therapy.
[00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:20.860]   People don't just walk in and say,
[00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:22.140]   well, I was in the neighborhood,
[00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:25.820]   and I thought I'd pop in and talk to a total stranger,
[00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:30.180]   pay him some money, and then walk out as a different person.
[00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:31.460]   It doesn't work that way.
[00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:35.220]   I've often said to people, this is not about curing you
[00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:36.580]   'cause you're not a disease.
[00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:41.020]   This is about making your life more interesting,
[00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:44.020]   where you realize every morning you get up,
[00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:47.520]   you have something profound to address today.
[00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:51.020]   "Why am I here and in service to what?"
[00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:52.500]   'Cause if you don't ask that question,
[00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:55.580]   you're gonna be in service to your adaptive postures
[00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:58.580]   from childhood, as many people prove to be,
[00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:02.420]   until the conflict within reaches that point
[00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:03.780]   where the suffering of the soul,
[00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:05.960]   psychopathology, is sufficient.
[00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:10.940]   I, myself, was cruising along in my 30s.
[00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:14.020]   I'd achieved everything that I wanted to achieve,
[00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:17.380]   and was enjoying my life, and then suddenly, inexplicably,
[00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:18.960]   had a very serious depression.
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:22.900]   And it took me a while to realize
[00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:25.280]   that I was asking the wrong question.
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:27.020]   The first question that occurs to a person
[00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:29.580]   under those circumstances is,
[00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:31.540]   how quickly do I get rid of this?
[00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:36.160]   Give me five easy steps, or a pill for that, or whatever.
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:37.900]   I didn't understand the real question is,
[00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:40.260]   why has your psyche autonomously
[00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:42.980]   withdrawn its approval and support
[00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:45.860]   from the agenda that you've been addressing?
[00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:48.860]   It was a good agenda, nothing wrong with it,
[00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:50.320]   but there was something else
[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:52.780]   that was missing in this process.
[00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:53.820]   And it took a depression.
[00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:55.540]   It's like something from below
[00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:56.980]   reached up and pulled me down.
[00:24:56.980 --> 00:24:58.800]   Something was being pressed down.
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:00.780]   That's depression.
[00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:02.740]   And at the bottom of that well,
[00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:04.780]   there's always a task.
[00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:06.860]   There's always an issue.
[00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:09.880]   The identification of which can lead one
[00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:13.480]   into a new place in one's life, a different journey.
[00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:16.660]   In my case, it led me to
[00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:23.100]   leave a very fine tenure position in academia,
[00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:26.860]   travel to Switzerland, and spend several years there
[00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:29.540]   in retraining as a psychoanalyst.
[00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:33.620]   And I now look upon that depression as beneficent,
[00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:37.340]   but at the time, I certainly didn't, as you can imagine.
[00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:38.500]   - I'd like to take a brief break
[00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:41.020]   and acknowledge our sponsor, AG1.
[00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:42.980]   By now, most of you have heard me tell my story
[00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:45.660]   about how I've been taking AG1 once or twice a day,
[00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:47.340]   every day since 2012.
[00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:48.780]   And indeed, that's true.
[00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:51.060]   I started taking AG1 and I still take AG1
[00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:52.420]   once or twice a day,
[00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:54.220]   because it gives me vitamins and minerals
[00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:55.620]   that I might not be getting enough of
[00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:57.280]   from whole foods that I eat,
[00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:00.180]   as well as adaptogens and micronutrients.
[00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:02.560]   And those adaptogens and micronutrients are really critical,
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:05.180]   because even though I strive to eat most of my foods
[00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:08.100]   from unprocessed or minimally processed whole foods,
[00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:09.140]   it's often hard to do so,
[00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:12.020]   especially when I'm traveling and especially when I'm busy.
[00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:14.260]   So by drinking a packet of AG1 in the morning,
[00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:17.580]   and oftentimes also again in the afternoon or evening,
[00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:19.560]   I'm ensuring that I'm getting everything I need.
[00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:22.380]   I'm covering all of my foundational nutritional needs.
[00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:25.380]   And I, like so many other people that take AG1 regularly,
[00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:26.940]   just report feeling better.
[00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:28.220]   And that shouldn't be surprising,
[00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:29.500]   because it supports gut health.
[00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:31.120]   And of course, gut health supports
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:33.140]   immune system health and brain health.
[00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:34.740]   And it's supporting a ton of different
[00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:36.820]   cellular and organ processes
[00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:38.740]   that all interact with one another.
[00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:40.500]   So while certain supplements are really directed
[00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:42.060]   towards one specific outcome,
[00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:44.220]   like sleeping better or being more alert,
[00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:47.580]   AG1 really is foundational nutritional support.
[00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:49.020]   It's really designed to support
[00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:50.920]   all of the systems of your brain and body
[00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:53.100]   that relate to mental health and physical health.
[00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:54.380]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:57.760]   you can go to drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:26:59.200]   to claim a special offer.
[00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:01.580]   They'll give you five free travel packs with your order,
[00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:04.220]   plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:08.440]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman.
[00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:13.120]   - So if our task is to get in touch with
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:16.360]   this kind of yearning of the soul,
[00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:20.660]   to perhaps do some reparative work from our childhood,
[00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:24.260]   or at least understand our parent-child relationships.
[00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:26.540]   And then in an ideal circumstance,
[00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:31.420]   to express ourselves through some higher calling,
[00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:32.260]   if you will.
[00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:34.900]   But higher meaning for us or for the world,
[00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:37.320]   hopefully both, that would be ideal.
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:40.380]   In terms of the day, you know,
[00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:42.420]   you said you can wake up in the morning,
[00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:45.380]   presumably some of the residual thought processes
[00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:48.380]   and emotions from a dream or dreams
[00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:50.940]   still live within us early in the day.
[00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:52.400]   And then we start going about our day
[00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:53.680]   doing the practical things,
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:55.860]   making the cup of coffee, drinking the water,
[00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:58.540]   getting some sunshine, these sorts of things.
[00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:04.100]   How is it that the typical person,
[00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:07.500]   any of us can think about segmenting our thinking
[00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:10.380]   and our actions in a way that we're touching
[00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:12.860]   into the deeper meaning of life
[00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:14.460]   while also carrying out a life?
[00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:15.740]   Because as you know, and I know,
[00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:17.620]   and everybody listening and watching knows
[00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:19.460]   that there's stuff to do.
[00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:22.900]   We need to often get an education, make a living,
[00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:24.900]   tend to people around us, tend to ourselves.
[00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:29.900]   And it becomes a kind of a neuroscience problem in my mind,
[00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:33.080]   right, you know, different brain circuitries
[00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:34.820]   for different types of thinking.
[00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:37.660]   And if I may, I think it also becomes
[00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:39.300]   a time perception problem.
[00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:42.240]   You know, the brain, the human brain to me is so magnificent
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:44.940]   at setting milestones that are like get in the shower,
[00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:48.380]   finish the shower, check the text messages,
[00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:49.860]   talk to somebody and get about the day.
[00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:51.700]   The milestones become very close in.
[00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:54.700]   And then if we're lucky enough to be able to take a walk
[00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:57.220]   and reflect, put the phone away, et cetera,
[00:28:57.220 --> 00:29:00.100]   then our mind can expand into, you know,
[00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:01.580]   gosh, why am I here?
[00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:05.420]   You know, what about that thing my grandfather said to me
[00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:07.220]   or my grandmother said to me?
[00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:10.820]   And you know, that the ability to place our perception
[00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:12.780]   in larger or smaller time bins
[00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:14.940]   seems very closely linked to all of this
[00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:17.980]   and to the sense of mortality,
[00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:20.140]   which we'll certainly talk about in a little bit.
[00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:23.180]   But in a kind of a practical way,
[00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:25.480]   in the absence of a daily therapy session,
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:32.420]   how do you suggest people start to segment
[00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:36.380]   or compartmentalize in a way that's functional?
[00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:40.740]   For instance, should people set aside 15 minutes
[00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:45.620]   each morning to just think about why they're on this earth
[00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:49.300]   and why they're doing and what they're doing
[00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:51.740]   as opposed to just doing?
[00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:54.300]   - Sure, well, this is a central problem of our time
[00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:58.740]   is everybody's gonna say, I don't have time for that.
[00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:02.500]   I had a colleague, now deceased, Marian Woodman in Toronto,
[00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:04.620]   who used to say to her clients,
[00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:07.620]   you have to guarantee me one hour per day
[00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:10.060]   that you reflect on your dreams
[00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:13.340]   or you journal in terms of what's going on in your life.
[00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:16.700]   And she said, always people say, I don't have time for that.
[00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:20.060]   Then she said, then you don't have time for therapy.
[00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:24.660]   You're not making any priority here for this.
[00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:26.980]   And you're right, the claims of,
[00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:31.300]   Wordsworth wrote in 1802, the world is too much with us,
[00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:34.300]   getting and spending, we lay waste our powers.
[00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:37.340]   This is 1802, before the internet, right?
[00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:39.380]   With all of its claims upon us.
[00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:41.820]   There's such a noisy din around us,
[00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:44.980]   we're all distracted by that, you see?
[00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:47.780]   That's why it usually takes a crisis in a marriage
[00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:50.220]   or depression or whatever the case may be
[00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:54.900]   to get people to pull out of that and reflect upon that.
[00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:58.620]   So I spend 15 minutes every morning before starting,
[00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:01.260]   just meditating, particularly working on a dream
[00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:02.900]   if I've had a dream.
[00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:06.100]   And secondly, I reflect on things in the evening too,
[00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:09.380]   because one of the things we wanna try to do is to say,
[00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:13.900]   what are the stories I'm living here?
[00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:15.420]   One of them, I've gotta earn a living.
[00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:16.620]   One of them, I've gotta do this.
[00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:18.740]   Another one's, I have to do that, you see?
[00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:22.300]   But what's all of that frenzy about, you see?
[00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:25.020]   That's why I think the first half of life,
[00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:28.060]   and I say this semi-humorously,
[00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:30.580]   is a huge and unavoidable mistake,
[00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:32.380]   'cause we're living just reactively.
[00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:33.580]   You see, it's not generative,
[00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:37.460]   it's reacting to whatever's going on around us.
[00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:41.500]   Is one's entire life to be spent reacting to things?
[00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:43.920]   Now, when you're young,
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:47.960]   there's only so much ego strength to reflect upon this.
[00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:51.080]   A number of years ago, I was asked to give a talk
[00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:55.600]   to an advanced group of college students at a university
[00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:58.480]   on the psychodynamics of love.
[00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:00.000]   Well, they were all interested about love,
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.680]   I can tell you, right?
[00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:03.680]   So it was a three-hour seminar.
[00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:04.960]   So over the first 90 minutes,
[00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:08.080]   we talked about projection, transference, all these,
[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:10.400]   they got it, they were smart kids.
[00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:11.740]   And then we took a short break.
[00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:12.680]   And then we came back, and I said,
[00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:14.680]   now let's apply these ideas
[00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:17.480]   to your current or recent relationships.
[00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:19.880]   It was like the curtain came down.
[00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:23.960]   You know, they were 19, 20, 21, 22, in that area.
[00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:26.880]   They couldn't bear, they could get the idea,
[00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:29.080]   but they couldn't bear to look at themselves
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:31.440]   with that kind of scrutiny.
[00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:33.840]   Flash forward 20 years, when they're 40,
[00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:35.400]   and their marriage just dissolved,
[00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:40.400]   or the relationship has hardships of one kind or another,
[00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:43.440]   they're much more likely to be able to,
[00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:47.960]   A, have enough ego strength to bear looking at oneself.
[00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:52.540]   Secondly, there's enough life experience to reflect upon.
[00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:57.280]   Because this kind of work takes courage in the first place.
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:33:00.160]   I have to be able to bear to look at myself
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:04.160]   and see what's there, which won't always be pretty.
[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:06.200]   And secondly, it's humbling.
[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:09.640]   Because this is not about feeling great,
[00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:12.080]   it's about being called to accountability,
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:14.320]   which is a whole different matter.
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:16.680]   To be an adult is not just to have a big body,
[00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:19.560]   it's to know that I'm accountable
[00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:22.520]   for what's spilling into the world through me.
[00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:25.200]   Jung said once in one of those telling statements
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:27.680]   that haunts me in a constructive way,
[00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:30.040]   he said the greatest burden a child must bear
[00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:32.740]   is the unlived life of the parent.
[00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:37.740]   So where I'm stuck as a person, my children will be stuck,
[00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:41.320]   or they'll be spending their life trying to get unstuck.
[00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:46.600]   So the best thing I can do for them is to model for them
[00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:50.240]   a life lived with as much courage as I can mobilize,
[00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:53.400]   and as much integrity as I can manage.
[00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:55.840]   And in doing that, it not only models,
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:57.640]   it gives permission to them.
[00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:00.880]   One of the things I've found for many people
[00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:03.280]   is they don't really feel permission
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:07.240]   to feel what they feel, desire what they desire,
[00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:09.880]   go out and fight for what matters to them.
[00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:13.320]   Because life, we learn early, is conditional.
[00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:15.440]   You will be acceptable in this family,
[00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:18.220]   you will perhaps be loved, you'll be rewarded,
[00:34:18.220 --> 00:34:22.120]   or you'll be punished if you meet these conditions.
[00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:23.600]   And if you don't meet the conditions,
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:28.200]   a lot of people put conditions on their children.
[00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:32.060]   A lot of people are still living through their children.
[00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:36.720]   If you'll forgive the joke here,
[00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:39.400]   there's an old joke about Jewish mothers.
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:41.320]   The fetus is not considered full term
[00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:44.460]   until it's graduated from medical school, you see.
[00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:48.680]   And that's, it's a joke about a cultural expectation,
[00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:52.360]   and carrying someone else's unfinished business
[00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:56.360]   in a way in which, you know, is to make them feel good,
[00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:59.000]   rather than serve what is wanting expression through you,
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.120]   which is quite a different matter.
[00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:04.560]   So one of the things one has to do is seize permission
[00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:09.560]   to realize life is short, we're here a very brief time,
[00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:12.520]   and the summons is to live your journey
[00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:15.160]   as honestly as you can.
[00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:18.440]   And when you do, it ultimately serves other people.
[00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:21.400]   It's not selfish, it's actually serving the self,
[00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:22.920]   if you will.
[00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:26.160]   It's not narcissistic, it's not self-absorption,
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:27.840]   it's actually humbling.
[00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:31.040]   I would never have imagined as a child
[00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:33.060]   that I would spend my adult life
[00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:34.760]   listening to people's suffering.
[00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:37.960]   And yet that's my day job.
[00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:41.080]   And I'm humbled to be invited into the lives
[00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:44.300]   of other people, it's profoundly meaningful.
[00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:47.040]   I can't imagine living without that.
[00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:52.040]   At the same time, it's not fun, it's not pleasant,
[00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:56.320]   but it's profoundly meaningful, that's the distinction.
[00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:59.560]   That's why of those various sources of insight
[00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:01.020]   that we can have into our lives,
[00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:04.220]   you have to ask about what is most meaningful to me,
[00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:07.140]   as defined by the psyche, not by the culture around you.
[00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:08.100]   'Cause what the culture says,
[00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:09.600]   it's all about being successful,
[00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:10.800]   it's all about making money,
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:12.860]   it's about living in this neighborhood,
[00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:15.100]   it's about buying that object.
[00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:18.380]   And if that worked, we would know it.
[00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:19.740]   It obviously doesn't.
[00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:23.540]   So that's what brings us back to that humbling moment
[00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:26.940]   that maybe I'm not living my life.
[00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:29.620]   Siren Kierkegaard, the Danish theologian
[00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:31.900]   in Copenhagen in the 19th century,
[00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:35.600]   talked about a man who was shocked to find his name
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:39.120]   in the obituary column, and he hadn't realized he'd died.
[00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:40.740]   'Cause he hadn't realized that he was here
[00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:42.540]   in the first place.
[00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:43.860]   Now this is Kierkegaard talking
[00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:45.840]   in the middle of the 19th century.
[00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:49.300]   Think about the ramping up of the stimuli around us,
[00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:51.840]   the steady drum.
[00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:54.220]   Among young people, you take away their cell phone,
[00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:56.520]   they experience enormous anxiety,
[00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:58.820]   because this is their link to the world,
[00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:02.020]   and yet it's constantly making demands upon them.
[00:37:02.020 --> 00:37:04.520]   So again, underneath all of this,
[00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:07.360]   is we have an appointment with our own souls.
[00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:09.400]   And the question is,
[00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:11.920]   are you gonna show up for the appointment?
[00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:16.460]   And I thought I had, but my psyche thought otherwise,
[00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:18.860]   so it was in the midst of a serious depression
[00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:21.080]   that I began showing up.
[00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:23.380]   And it was a difficult process,
[00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:27.480]   but ultimately proved to be, I think, transformative.
[00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:31.540]   - I certainly agree that hardship, for better or worse,
[00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:33.600]   is often the way that these things stimulate
[00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:36.240]   the self-reflection that's required for change.
[00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:41.320]   There seems to be a tricky situation,
[00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:44.900]   whereby on the one hand, I'm hearing, and I agree,
[00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:47.820]   that it all starts with being very honest with oneself
[00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:50.400]   about what one really wants.
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:54.600]   And I love and thank you for mentioning this 15 minutes
[00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:56.240]   in the early part of the day,
[00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:58.560]   perhaps, ideally, 15 minutes at the end of the day,
[00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:02.160]   where one takes time away from input from others
[00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:04.520]   of any form, electronic or otherwise,
[00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:07.560]   to just reflect on what's inside,
[00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:09.480]   and the messages coming up through dreams
[00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:11.800]   and reflection, et cetera.
[00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:12.860]   So important.
[00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:16.080]   - And may I just add another piece?
[00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:20.040]   Forgive the interruption, but I've often said to individuals,
[00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:23.160]   it's not so much what you believe, feel, or do,
[00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:25.320]   it's what it's in service to inside of you.
[00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:27.620]   That's an important distinction.
[00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:30.280]   So I may think I've done a good thing,
[00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:33.120]   when it's really an old codependence,
[00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:36.160]   or it's a way of avoiding conflict,
[00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:39.340]   or it's a fear-driven response.
[00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:40.960]   We have to always be asking,
[00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:44.560]   but what was that in service to inside of me?
[00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:46.060]   And you may not know at first,
[00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:47.520]   but you keep asking the question,
[00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:50.900]   and it'll start rising to the surface,
[00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:53.000]   you begin to recognize that.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.880]   That's how we begin to identify
[00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:58.940]   some of those internal drivers that we call the complexes.
[00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:02.920]   Because again, they're clusters of energy
[00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:06.040]   with the power to create a provisional personality.
[00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:10.240]   And many times people are identified with their complex.
[00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:11.520]   That's who I am.
[00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:14.800]   I am what I do, or I am my performance,
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:18.560]   rather than beneath all of this is a human being
[00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:22.760]   who is wandering through life, afraid of dying,
[00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:24.920]   trying to avoid pain as much as possible,
[00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:27.880]   and hoping that someone's gonna step in
[00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:29.000]   and make it all right.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:33.160]   - I'm certainly familiar with the feeling of
[00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:37.320]   recognizing what I want,
[00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:42.320]   but being afraid that if I were to express that,
[00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:46.720]   that it would not be accepted.
[00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:47.560]   - Certainly.
[00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:50.140]   - And that certainly can create problems.
[00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:53.320]   I'm also familiar with recognizing what I want
[00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:54.640]   and stating it very clearly,
[00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:58.560]   and some people fortunately responding well.
[00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:00.880]   But I think it's fair to say,
[00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:02.280]   at least based on my experience,
[00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:04.680]   that when we are really honest with ourselves
[00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:08.200]   and with others, it doesn't always land well, right?
[00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:10.240]   I mean, I pay a lot of attention,
[00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:13.160]   probably too much to messaging on social media
[00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:15.400]   in the landscape of science and health.
[00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:17.640]   It's just kind of the world I live in
[00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:19.720]   much of the time these days.
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:24.160]   And what I noticed is that there's a real gravitational pull
[00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:27.840]   of people to, let's call them whatever they are,
[00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:29.200]   influencers, public figures,
[00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:34.200]   or that are just very clear about who they are,
[00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:36.160]   at least in their own self-perception.
[00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:39.360]   But then herein lies the twist, it seems,
[00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:41.080]   is that what I'm hearing is that
[00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:44.520]   often our self-perception is not accurate.
[00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:45.360]   - That's correct.
[00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:48.280]   - And it's almost futile to try and convince people
[00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:51.280]   that we are who we believe we are, right?
[00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:53.000]   And I have a theory that's emerging.
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:56.280]   It's not a formal theory that the internet
[00:40:56.280 --> 00:41:00.120]   and in particular social media is borderline.
[00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:03.480]   It weaves back and forth between sane and psychotic,
[00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:05.160]   as if a borderline person would,
[00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:09.520]   projecting either adoration or total disgust.
[00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:12.160]   And I warn anybody now, including myself,
[00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:13.660]   if you're going on social media,
[00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:18.040]   you're interacting with a borderline organism.
[00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:21.140]   So you need to be prepared to be told in various ways,
[00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:24.420]   sometimes subtle, sometimes overt, that you're terrible.
[00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:29.480]   And you also need to be prepared for immense reward
[00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:32.280]   and being told that you're spectacular,
[00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:33.740]   simply by being there.
[00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:36.360]   That's what it is to interact with a borderline person.
[00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:40.600]   And there's no controlling or predicting their flips.
[00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:45.440]   So in any event, that's a little theory that's emerging.
[00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:47.180]   Why wouldn't it be that way, right?
[00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:49.080]   You're the psychologist, but why wouldn't it be that way?
[00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:52.240]   Because ultimately social media is the emergent property
[00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:53.880]   of all these individuals.
[00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:59.300]   Okay, so you've made it clear how one way
[00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:01.960]   to anchor to the self and get in touch
[00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:04.360]   with what's really going on inside.
[00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:06.960]   Reflecting on dreams, reflecting on what geysers
[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:09.940]   to the surface, journaling, perhaps meditation,
[00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:15.120]   ideally twice a day, perhaps therapy as well would be ideal.
[00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:16.920]   But then we move about our day
[00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:19.680]   and we do our best to be the best version of ourselves.
[00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:24.580]   And when we get positive feedback, we tend to,
[00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:28.480]   I think as neurobiological, psychological organisms,
[00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:29.480]   do more of that.
[00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:30.320]   - Do more of that.
[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:34.860]   - And it's sort of a bank account of sorts.
[00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:37.200]   We're going for a net positive balance.
[00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:39.640]   And we tend to do less of the things
[00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:42.080]   that give us negative feedback,
[00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:43.940]   except perhaps go to social media
[00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:45.520]   where people seem to go on there
[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:48.440]   specifically for friction-based interactions as well,
[00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:49.920]   which is its own thing.
[00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:54.120]   So as we move through life, first half of life,
[00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:56.000]   second half of life,
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:00.400]   how is it that we can orient in time,
[00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:01.560]   as I kind of put it before,
[00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:06.160]   how can we carry out these daily or weekly
[00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:08.920]   or maybe yearly reflections
[00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:11.240]   in a way that really serves us well?
[00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:13.600]   I mean, do you recommend one day a week
[00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:14.920]   stepping away from everything?
[00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:18.440]   Do you recommend doing retreats of sort?
[00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:22.180]   Do you recommend that people keep a life journal?
[00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:26.280]   Is the story and seeing how one story evolves,
[00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:27.520]   is this useful?
[00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:30.280]   What I'm trying to do here is kind of orient people
[00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:31.740]   to some practical tools,
[00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:34.880]   because I think at some level
[00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:40.320]   we can get pulled down currents of any kind.
[00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:44.240]   And ideally we stay out of deep pathology,
[00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:47.840]   but even if we hit the rumble strips
[00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:49.740]   and go back over and over again,
[00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:52.880]   this is important work, right?
[00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:55.640]   This is about being the best version of ourselves
[00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:57.280]   and society benefits from that.
[00:43:57.280 --> 00:44:01.680]   So are there more macroscopic things that we can do,
[00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:05.200]   or is it just a daily chip away to meditations,
[00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:09.480]   ideally therapy, journal, and just anchor down
[00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:13.000]   do we ever get to relax?
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.580]   - Well, of course, of course.
[00:44:15.580 --> 00:44:19.080]   First of all, there's no formula that's applicable
[00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:21.440]   to everybody and their life circumstances.
[00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:23.400]   You know, the word psychotherapy literally means
[00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:27.880]   from the Greek to listen to or pay attention to the soul.
[00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:31.160]   However you go about doing that is right for you.
[00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:33.080]   It's up to you to figure that out.
[00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:35.520]   And for some people be working in nature,
[00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:37.600]   for others to be working with their hands,
[00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:40.160]   for others it'll be through some creative enterprise
[00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:43.940]   or working with their dreams or meditating or whatever.
[00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:49.120]   I would say whatever helps you step out
[00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:52.360]   of the stimulus response, stimulus response melee
[00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:57.360]   that we call our daily life is likely to be helpful to you
[00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:00.600]   either because you rest and you restore the psyche
[00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:03.400]   and or you have some reflection upon it.
[00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:06.720]   You recollect yourself as it is, right?
[00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:10.640]   You remember the self because we get unraveled.
[00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:14.480]   I often have the feeling of getting unraveled in life
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:16.800]   where, you know, this calls you and this calls you
[00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:18.240]   and this calls you and that calls you.
[00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:22.200]   And it's just pulling you away from some center here.
[00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:24.760]   And again, this is not about self-absorption,
[00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:29.080]   but if I'm not in connection with something abiding here,
[00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:32.120]   my behaviors or choices there are not gonna be very helpful
[00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:34.120]   in the long run, you see.
[00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:36.640]   They're gonna be merely responsive to the demands
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:38.520]   of the environmental circumstances.
[00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:43.560]   - One thing I enjoy doing from time to time is drawing.
[00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:45.560]   I like doing anatomical drawings and things of that sort.
[00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:48.480]   And I find that if I engage in an activity
[00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:51.320]   that absorbs all of my attention,
[00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:55.360]   even though I have zero minus one aspirations
[00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:58.680]   of becoming a commercial artist or something of that sort,
[00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:00.880]   that two things happen.
[00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:04.040]   One, I exit the stimulus response world
[00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:07.740]   and at the same time,
[00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:10.880]   it's inevitable that some insight comes later.
[00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:11.760]   - That's right.
[00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:12.880]   - What is that?
[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:15.040]   - Well, see, I think that's a good example though,
[00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:18.040]   as you said, of exiting the stimulus response cycle
[00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:22.200]   because in that moment, something in your psyche rises
[00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:24.680]   to express itself through you.
[00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:27.800]   And, you know, it's your drawing.
[00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:30.360]   We could perhaps read that drawing
[00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:33.440]   and perhaps interpret something of it.
[00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:36.400]   You know, like the famous Rorschach, for example.
[00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:38.400]   Rorschach's an inkblot.
[00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:40.160]   When's an inkblot not an inkblot?
[00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:43.880]   Well, when I confabulate a response to it, you see,
[00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:45.480]   and that response is indicative
[00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:47.920]   of what is going on inside of me.
[00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:49.120]   So that's a good example.
[00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:50.720]   I mean, for some people, you know,
[00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:53.160]   they have those moments when they're out jogging,
[00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:54.800]   for example, or riding a bicycle
[00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:59.000]   or whatever it does, listening to music.
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.540]   There's no right path for everyone.
[00:47:01.540 --> 00:47:03.560]   It's like, find the place
[00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:07.480]   where you're able to be alone with yourself.
[00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:10.200]   And if you can tolerate being with yourself
[00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:13.360]   and you pay attention,
[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:16.680]   something will start coming up, you see.
[00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:19.480]   And ultimately, ironically, that's the cure
[00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:23.080]   to the great disease of our time, which is loneliness.
[00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:27.080]   It's interesting that the UK and Japan
[00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:31.280]   now have cabinet level posts for ministers of loneliness.
[00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:32.240]   So great is the loneliness.
[00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:35.060]   We've never been more connected in human history
[00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:36.680]   through our electronic media.
[00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:39.860]   And yet people are now isolated in their rooms,
[00:47:39.860 --> 00:47:41.680]   talking to each other.
[00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:44.640]   And I saw a cartoon, probably New York or somewhere,
[00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:46.100]   where a couple was getting married
[00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:49.240]   and the minister says to the couple,
[00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:51.200]   "Text each other, I do."
[00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:53.560]   It was ultimately a joke about
[00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:57.160]   how we are so media dependent now
[00:47:57.160 --> 00:47:59.640]   that we're disconnected from each other.
[00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:01.880]   And so whatever it is
[00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:05.360]   that helps you link to something in here.
[00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:06.600]   Jung asked this question,
[00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:09.400]   which I'm also haunted by in a constructive way.
[00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:11.840]   He said, "We all need to find what supports us
[00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:13.420]   "when nothing supports us."
[00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:16.680]   And that's ultimately the cure for loneliness,
[00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:18.160]   that there's something inside of me
[00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:19.840]   that knows me better than me,
[00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:26.000]   is working hard to bring about a healthy response
[00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:30.480]   to whatever life brings.
[00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:32.440]   And it has a purposefulness to it,
[00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:35.440]   an intentionality, an expression.
[00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:37.960]   And when I'm in touch with that,
[00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:41.160]   I feel that sense of wholeness and purposefulness.
[00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:42.280]   When I'm out of it,
[00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:44.880]   it's when I start unraveling, so to speak.
[00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:49.520]   And that's how we get exhausted and burned out and so forth.
[00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:54.480]   So again, I use that word recollecting, remembering.
[00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:56.960]   It's like pulling the pieces back together again
[00:48:56.960 --> 00:48:58.440]   in some way.
[00:48:58.440 --> 00:48:59.820]   So what Shakespeare said,
[00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:05.360]   knitting the raveled sleeve of care, you see.
[00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:07.080]   He was using the same metaphor
[00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:09.260]   of being unraveled in some way.
[00:49:09.260 --> 00:49:13.620]   - I love this notion of spending time alone
[00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:18.040]   and accessing one's deepest resource for self-care
[00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:20.320]   as a way to deal with loneliness.
[00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:23.240]   Because ultimately, I also completely agree
[00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:28.240]   that stimulus response is the hallmark of text messaging.
[00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:32.880]   There can be useful aspects of text messaging, of course,
[00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:35.280]   coordinating plans, et cetera, and communicating.
[00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:37.040]   But certainly social media,
[00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:39.520]   we have a stimulus response device.
[00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:41.320]   Some people think of it more like a slot machine,
[00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:44.640]   but it never actually returns the jackpot, is the issue.
[00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:48.160]   And I also think that social media can be terrific
[00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:50.880]   for educating and learning as well.
[00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:53.560]   Certainly much of what I do or strive to do.
[00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:57.880]   I think time alone is incredibly beneficial.
[00:49:57.880 --> 00:49:59.800]   So thank you for highlighting that.
[00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:02.760]   And also that it doesn't take much,
[00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:06.680]   maybe even a half hour walk or something of that sort.
[00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:08.600]   If I may, what do you think happens
[00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:11.240]   when we exit that stimulus response mode?
[00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:12.960]   Do you think the unconscious mind
[00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:15.880]   is revealed a bit more to us?
[00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:18.480]   And I think of the unconscious mind,
[00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:21.200]   a former guest on this podcast,
[00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:23.200]   a psychiatrist, described the unconscious
[00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:27.400]   as kind of like the iceberg that's beneath the surface,
[00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:30.280]   all the stuff going on that we're entirely unaware of.
[00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:32.320]   Do you think that the water recedes a little bit?
[00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:33.400]   - Oh, absolutely.
[00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:37.040]   Because there's no room for the expression
[00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:41.000]   of whatever's wanting to be acknowledged within us
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:42.560]   when we're constantly responding
[00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:44.260]   to our environmental demands.
[00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:47.920]   One of the things I try to do is walk a mile every day.
[00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:50.400]   I've gone through some health issues in recent years.
[00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:55.120]   And so I'm sort of in a physical recovery stage of life.
[00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:57.240]   And I walk a mile a day,
[00:50:57.240 --> 00:50:59.680]   even though it's physically difficult.
[00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:03.500]   And I find that revelatory because that's,
[00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:06.760]   I'm focused on being present here
[00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:08.920]   rather than all of the distractions there.
[00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:12.440]   And that's one of the things that I have found
[00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:15.240]   a form of meditation, if you will.
[00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:17.940]   And what comes up for me is often surprising.
[00:51:17.940 --> 00:51:21.160]   - I've talked before on the podcast
[00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:23.280]   about meditation, clinical hypnosis,
[00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:24.580]   something called the yoga nidra,
[00:51:24.580 --> 00:51:26.800]   which is a self-directed relaxation.
[00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:28.760]   Some of us call it non-sleep deep rest, et cetera.
[00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:30.860]   And without taking us on a tangent,
[00:51:30.860 --> 00:51:34.960]   I raise this because we keep talking about meditation.
[00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:36.880]   And I think to a lot of people,
[00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:39.260]   meditation sounds like something esoteric.
[00:51:39.260 --> 00:51:41.240]   To me, as a neuroscientist,
[00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:43.760]   meditation is a perceptual exercise.
[00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:45.300]   It can be done to enhance focus
[00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:48.240]   by focusing on a specific location behind the forehead
[00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:50.040]   or looking at a light.
[00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:54.180]   It can be an open monitoring meditation
[00:51:54.180 --> 00:51:55.720]   where you're intentionally not trying to focus
[00:51:55.720 --> 00:51:56.560]   on any one thing.
[00:51:56.560 --> 00:51:58.760]   But at the end of the day, it's a perceptual,
[00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:01.200]   it's a deliberate perceptual shift,
[00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:05.300]   much in the same way that if I decide to, you know,
[00:52:05.300 --> 00:52:07.840]   listen to an opera with my eyes closed,
[00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:09.980]   that's a, in some sense, it's a meditation.
[00:52:09.980 --> 00:52:11.720]   It's a deliberate perceptual shift.
[00:52:13.620 --> 00:52:16.520]   So a deliberate perceptual shift
[00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:17.760]   that we're calling a meditation,
[00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:20.020]   which I think is a great label for it,
[00:52:20.020 --> 00:52:22.660]   that is directly aimed at better understanding
[00:52:22.660 --> 00:52:24.820]   one's own unconscious processing
[00:52:24.820 --> 00:52:27.780]   so that one can then lean into
[00:52:27.780 --> 00:52:31.100]   the stimulus response parts of life
[00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:32.900]   with more intentionality,
[00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:35.740]   with less opportunity to hit the rumble strips
[00:52:35.740 --> 00:52:36.940]   or go into the gutter.
[00:52:36.940 --> 00:52:41.500]   - With a more authentic response to it, you see,
[00:52:41.500 --> 00:52:43.840]   because it's more likely to be coming out of me
[00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:45.500]   rather than simply being reactive.
[00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:47.620]   I think that's the important thing.
[00:52:47.620 --> 00:52:49.060]   - What's so important about what you're saying
[00:52:49.060 --> 00:52:52.220]   is that for years now, we've heard about, you know,
[00:52:52.220 --> 00:52:56.180]   meditation being important as a way to intervene
[00:52:56.180 --> 00:52:59.900]   in the stimulus response process.
[00:52:59.900 --> 00:53:02.740]   And people say, be responsive, not reactive.
[00:53:02.740 --> 00:53:04.080]   And it all sounds so wonderful,
[00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:06.380]   just as sounding, being gritty and resilient
[00:53:06.380 --> 00:53:07.220]   sounds wonderful.
[00:53:07.220 --> 00:53:09.480]   But one of the things that's really important here
[00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:13.140]   that you're raising is that there are methods to do this.
[00:53:13.140 --> 00:53:15.620]   They almost always involve going inward
[00:53:15.620 --> 00:53:19.100]   or someone who can see what we can't see
[00:53:19.100 --> 00:53:21.140]   pointing out blind spots in us.
[00:53:21.140 --> 00:53:22.020]   - That's right.
[00:53:22.020 --> 00:53:25.660]   Well, I think, again, the issue is to still the traffic
[00:53:25.660 --> 00:53:28.980]   inside and be present to the moment in whatever way that is.
[00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:31.340]   That's why I said a person can meditate
[00:53:31.340 --> 00:53:35.140]   by a work of the hands or by walking
[00:53:35.140 --> 00:53:39.180]   or something that pulls one out of the cycles
[00:53:39.180 --> 00:53:43.140]   that are running their little script over and over and over.
[00:53:43.140 --> 00:53:45.460]   So there are many forms of meditating.
[00:53:45.460 --> 00:53:47.860]   And, you know, ancient traditions have revealed that too.
[00:53:47.860 --> 00:53:50.020]   There was walking meditation and so forth.
[00:53:50.020 --> 00:53:52.120]   And you mentioned music.
[00:53:52.120 --> 00:53:53.540]   I think that's another example.
[00:53:53.540 --> 00:53:55.940]   To listen to music, I think, takes one out of,
[00:53:55.940 --> 00:53:57.140]   you know, Nietzsche said once,
[00:53:57.140 --> 00:54:00.060]   "Without music, life's a mistake."
[00:54:00.060 --> 00:54:02.180]   And I think what he was getting at was
[00:54:02.180 --> 00:54:06.740]   there is a sense in which music has no purpose
[00:54:06.740 --> 00:54:09.540]   except being itself.
[00:54:09.540 --> 00:54:12.600]   So when we're really present to the music,
[00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:15.400]   we were in the midst of being.
[00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:18.540]   If I'm, we're at spring right now,
[00:54:18.540 --> 00:54:19.680]   as you and I are talking,
[00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:21.240]   and it's beautiful in the neighborhood.
[00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:24.860]   And so I've been watching the flowers emerge and so forth.
[00:54:24.860 --> 00:54:27.340]   And simply being present to that
[00:54:27.340 --> 00:54:30.460]   means some of that other traffic is stilled.
[00:54:30.460 --> 00:54:32.840]   And then I returned and the traffic resumes.
[00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:36.800]   But maybe I have a little more of a sense of who I am
[00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:39.360]   and from whence I'm responding, you see,
[00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:42.840]   as a result of that recentering process.
[00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:45.640]   You know, the Zen folks talk about being no-minded.
[00:54:45.640 --> 00:54:47.760]   I think that was their way of talking about
[00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:50.200]   being present to this moment,
[00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:54.400]   but not consumed by the demands of this moment.
[00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:57.860]   And that's a difficult thing to manage, but it's essential.
[00:54:57.860 --> 00:55:00.000]   I'd like to take a brief break
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:02.860]   and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Waking Up.
[00:55:02.860 --> 00:55:04.360]   Waking Up is a meditation app
[00:55:04.360 --> 00:55:06.440]   that offers hundreds of guided meditations,
[00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:09.480]   mindfulness trainings, yoga needer sessions, and more.
[00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:11.800]   I started meditating over three decades ago.
[00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:13.640]   And what I found in the ensuing years
[00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:15.740]   is that sometimes it was very easy for me
[00:55:15.740 --> 00:55:17.440]   to do my daily meditation practice.
[00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:19.060]   I was just really diligent.
[00:55:19.060 --> 00:55:20.840]   But then as things would get more stressful,
[00:55:20.840 --> 00:55:21.860]   which of course is exactly
[00:55:21.860 --> 00:55:23.860]   when I should have been meditating more,
[00:55:23.860 --> 00:55:26.040]   my meditation practice would fall off.
[00:55:26.040 --> 00:55:28.580]   With Waking Up, they make it very easy to find
[00:55:28.580 --> 00:55:31.040]   and consistently use a given meditation practice.
[00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:32.840]   It has very convenient reminders
[00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:34.640]   and they come in different durations.
[00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:36.080]   So even if you just have one minute
[00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:37.440]   or five minutes to meditate,
[00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:38.840]   you can still get your meditation in,
[00:55:38.840 --> 00:55:41.680]   which research shows is still highly beneficial.
[00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:43.480]   In addition to the many different meditations
[00:55:43.480 --> 00:55:46.660]   on the Waking Up app, they also have yoga nidra sessions,
[00:55:46.660 --> 00:55:48.920]   which are a form of non-sleep deep rest
[00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:51.580]   that I personally find is extremely valuable
[00:55:51.580 --> 00:55:53.560]   for restoring mental and physical vigor.
[00:55:53.560 --> 00:55:54.980]   I tend to do a yoga nidra
[00:55:54.980 --> 00:55:58.080]   lasting anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes, at least once a day.
[00:55:58.080 --> 00:56:00.160]   And if I ever wake up in the middle of the night
[00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:01.600]   and I need to fall back asleep,
[00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:04.360]   I also find yoga nidra to be extremely useful.
[00:56:04.360 --> 00:56:06.320]   If you'd like to try the Waking Up app,
[00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:09.320]   you can go to wakingup.com/huberman
[00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:11.160]   to try a free 30-day trial.
[00:56:11.160 --> 00:56:14.180]   Again, that's wakingup.com/huberman.
[00:56:14.180 --> 00:56:17.520]   Perhaps we can talk about the shadow,
[00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:18.880]   this notion of the shadow.
[00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:21.220]   Sounds very ominous.
[00:56:21.220 --> 00:56:24.240]   What is the shadow?
[00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:28.800]   And are people aware of their shadows?
[00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:32.560]   And if they're not, how can they become aware of them?
[00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:34.400]   And how can they work with them?
[00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:38.240]   - Well, a shadow was Jung's metaphor
[00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:40.880]   for those parts of our own psyche
[00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:45.440]   and/or our affiliation with groups, for example,
[00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:47.840]   whether it's a religious group, educational group,
[00:56:47.840 --> 00:56:51.680]   a national identity, that when brought to consciousness,
[00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:56.200]   we find troubling, perhaps contradictory to our values
[00:56:56.200 --> 00:57:00.640]   or inimical to our sense of self-worth
[00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:01.640]   or something like that.
[00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:05.280]   For example, typical shadow issues include
[00:57:05.280 --> 00:57:08.240]   our capacity for jealousy and for envy,
[00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:11.960]   for aggression, for greed, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:57:11.960 --> 00:57:15.160]   We don't want to acknowledge those things,
[00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:19.040]   but since when are we exempt from the human condition?
[00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:21.120]   The wisest thing ever said about the shadow
[00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:24.320]   came from the Latin playwright Terence two millennia ago
[00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:29.000]   who said, "Nothing human is alien to me."
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:31.280]   Now, I think that's important to recognize.
[00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:34.740]   In me, I carry the entire capacity of human nature
[00:57:34.740 --> 00:57:36.600]   to express itself.
[00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:40.340]   Some of those forms of expressions will be acceptable
[00:57:40.340 --> 00:57:43.800]   to the society or to my psychological culture,
[00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:44.980]   and some will not be.
[00:57:44.980 --> 00:57:48.120]   And that's the shadow material.
[00:57:48.120 --> 00:57:50.160]   And there's the personal shadow
[00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:51.480]   and there are group shadows
[00:57:51.480 --> 00:57:55.040]   because nations can be possessed by bloodlust, for example,
[00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:58.080]   or a fashion is a shadow issue
[00:57:58.080 --> 00:58:00.000]   where everybody has to look the same way
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:02.640]   and dress the same way and so forth.
[00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:05.000]   The more insecure I am as a person,
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:07.200]   the more likely I'm going to try to look around me
[00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:09.200]   for what are the clues so I can fit in,
[00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:12.800]   be like others, and therefore I'll be acceptable.
[00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:14.240]   That's not a federal crime.
[00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:18.760]   That's a very deep complex that is left over from childhood.
[00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:22.520]   I'm not here to fit in, I'm here to be who I am,
[00:58:22.520 --> 00:58:25.520]   which at times will fit in and other times it won't,
[00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:29.120]   but that's okay because I'm at least in good relationships
[00:58:29.120 --> 00:58:31.360]   to myself at that point.
[00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:35.480]   So typically, the shadow manifests as being unconscious,
[00:58:35.480 --> 00:58:38.400]   therefore it just spills into the world through us.
[00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:41.440]   A perfect example of shadow issues, as I mentioned before,
[00:58:41.440 --> 00:58:43.640]   is parents expecting their children to grow up
[00:58:43.640 --> 00:58:47.840]   and have the same kind of values that I have, for example,
[00:58:47.840 --> 00:58:51.040]   same religious views, marry somebody that I find acceptable,
[00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:51.880]   et cetera, et cetera.
[00:58:51.880 --> 00:58:54.520]   Well, that's not really loving the otherness
[00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:55.480]   of the other, is it?
[00:58:55.480 --> 00:58:57.840]   It's not really loving a child for their own journey.
[00:58:57.840 --> 00:58:59.840]   That's them carrying some piece
[00:58:59.840 --> 00:59:02.760]   of their own unfinished business.
[00:59:02.760 --> 00:59:06.880]   Secondly, we disown the shadow by projecting on some,
[00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:09.000]   you know those people across the border there.
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:10.560]   You know, they're the carrier.
[00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:13.440]   They're what's wrong with this world, you see.
[00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:16.280]   I disown the shadow in myself
[00:59:16.280 --> 00:59:19.000]   by seeing it in everybody else around me.
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:21.320]   Jung actually said what often we find troubling
[00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:24.240]   in another person is because they're expressing something
[00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:25.720]   within our own unconscious.
[00:59:25.720 --> 00:59:29.880]   You know, as a certain itinerant rabbi said
[00:59:29.880 --> 00:59:33.560]   two millennia ago, I can see the speck in your eye,
[00:59:33.560 --> 00:59:35.080]   but miss the log in my own.
[00:59:35.080 --> 00:59:37.760]   That's a perfect illustration of what the shadow is.
[00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:41.200]   Thirdly, one can get caught up in it.
[00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:44.960]   That's at times what rock concerts are, mass events,
[00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:48.000]   people are caught up in a mob mentality
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:52.560]   where you lose your sense of individual ego identity
[00:59:52.560 --> 00:59:56.480]   and become subsumed into a collective mood.
[00:59:56.480 --> 01:00:00.520]   And you know, that could be a hanging mob, for example,
[01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:03.080]   as has happened in history too many times.
[01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:06.480]   And it could be a force for good or a force for evil.
[01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:08.120]   But again, the larger the group,
[01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:09.840]   the lower the level of consciousness
[01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:12.080]   of the individuals in that group.
[01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:15.760]   And then fourthly, we recognize it in ourselves.
[01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:19.720]   In a speech at Yale University in 1937,
[01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:22.520]   Jung said a person who could look
[01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:25.080]   at their own shadow and own it,
[01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:26.760]   he said now has a large problem
[01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:28.640]   because they're no longer to blame others
[01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:30.240]   for what goes wrong in their life.
[01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:32.600]   They have to acknowledge that within themselves.
[01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:35.240]   And he said further, it's the single best thing
[01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:37.080]   you can do for your society.
[01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:38.360]   This is not navel gazing.
[01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:41.680]   This is how you lift your unfinished business
[01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:44.360]   off of your partner, your children.
[01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:47.720]   Take it back yourself, which is a loving thing to do
[01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:49.480]   and a civic-minded thing to do
[01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:51.700]   if you look at it collectively here.
[01:00:51.700 --> 01:00:58.000]   - So how does one learn what their shadow or shadows?
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:01.560]   - Well, again, if you're married, ask your partner.
[01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:02.760]   - Sure, yeah.
[01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:04.800]   - Who will tell you immediately
[01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:07.060]   what your unfinished business may be.
[01:01:07.060 --> 01:01:10.760]   Or your children or your close friend, perhaps.
[01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:13.320]   It shows up in dreams.
[01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:16.120]   Freud talked about a young man
[01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:18.520]   who's disowned the content of his dream.
[01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:20.680]   He says, well, I don't, you know.
[01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:23.040]   Freud said, well, whose dream do you think that was?
[01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:23.880]   It was your dream.
[01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:25.720]   You have to acknowledge that
[01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:29.040]   that was embodying something within you.
[01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:32.240]   So there are many ways to recognize the shadow.
[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:34.360]   Often, consequences pile up,
[01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:36.120]   and then one begins to realize,
[01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:38.560]   well, the only consistent person
[01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:42.720]   in all the scenes of this drama I call my life is moi,
[01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:46.240]   so I have to acknowledge that that's my stuff.
[01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:48.400]   And that's a very humbling thing.
[01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:50.040]   That's why I say this work is humbling,
[01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:54.000]   not inflating in some way, it's humbling.
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:58.660]   So, again, shadow work is never gonna be popular
[01:01:58.660 --> 01:02:02.080]   because it means I'm taking responsibility.
[01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:04.860]   And yet, what else would being a human being
[01:02:04.860 --> 01:02:08.720]   who's responsible and adult-like do,
[01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:11.600]   except accept responsibility, you see?
[01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:13.240]   It's one of the definitions, I would say,
[01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:16.080]   of an adult person is I know I'm accountable
[01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:18.440]   for what spills into the world through me.
[01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:20.520]   Yes, I'm responding to various things
[01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:23.720]   that happen around me, but sooner or later,
[01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:28.720]   I'm the one bringing my stories, my conditioned responses,
[01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:32.520]   and something of my shadow to the mix
[01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:34.680]   and responding out of that.
[01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:38.860]   Now, that's a witch's brew at times, as you could imagine.
[01:02:38.860 --> 01:02:40.800]   At the same time, you recognize,
[01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:43.820]   all right, but that's my business to address
[01:02:43.820 --> 01:02:46.900]   because if I don't, it just continues.
[01:02:46.900 --> 01:02:49.580]   - What I observe in the world
[01:02:49.580 --> 01:02:51.300]   and what I've experienced before
[01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:56.300]   is that certainly we all have shadow sides, me, everybody.
[01:02:56.300 --> 01:02:59.140]   I mean, I think that's like,
[01:02:59.140 --> 01:03:00.660]   I think anyone that doesn't believe that
[01:03:00.660 --> 01:03:04.020]   is perhaps not of Homo sapiens.
[01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:08.780]   Maybe other animals have shadows too, who knows?
[01:03:08.780 --> 01:03:12.400]   But that when shadows clash, it becomes very confusing
[01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:14.980]   because given what you're saying,
[01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:17.500]   very few people address their shadows.
[01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:19.740]   And these days, especially,
[01:03:19.740 --> 01:03:21.340]   there's no need to make this political.
[01:03:21.340 --> 01:03:22.940]   This is just social.
[01:03:22.940 --> 01:03:24.060]   - Sure.
[01:03:24.060 --> 01:03:26.660]   - We see mobs forming.
[01:03:26.660 --> 01:03:29.780]   As you said, the larger the group,
[01:03:29.780 --> 01:03:32.360]   the lower the level of consciousness.
[01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:37.100]   And then it becomes even more challenging
[01:03:37.100 --> 01:03:38.580]   to address one's shadow
[01:03:38.580 --> 01:03:43.580]   when A, there's the perception of an attack.
[01:03:43.580 --> 01:03:49.460]   B, that attack oftentimes is the reflection
[01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:51.580]   of the other group's shadow.
[01:03:51.580 --> 01:03:54.880]   And C, people find refuge with people
[01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:59.000]   who have similar shadow processes.
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.400]   So not to be pessimistic here,
[01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:06.060]   but perhaps the answer is what you referred to before
[01:04:06.060 --> 01:04:07.960]   is to go inward to the self.
[01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:12.140]   Work with somebody or somebody close to you
[01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:14.660]   that has your best interest in mind,
[01:04:14.660 --> 01:04:16.840]   truly best interest in mind,
[01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:19.300]   and then try to resolve that.
[01:04:19.300 --> 01:04:20.140]   - Well, yes.
[01:04:20.140 --> 01:04:22.360]   And very few people are willing to do that.
[01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:24.260]   That's what polarizes societies,
[01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:26.300]   polarizes groups, and so forth.
[01:04:26.300 --> 01:04:29.620]   It's comforting to find like-minded people,
[01:04:29.620 --> 01:04:32.040]   but then they're both caught in the same complex
[01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:33.440]   is another way of putting it.
[01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:36.960]   So ultimately, whatever reality is,
[01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:38.320]   it's gonna wear through that
[01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:41.640]   and reveal something that's gonna be
[01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:43.840]   pretty disconcerting to individuals
[01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:46.840]   who are caught in a collective identification that way.
[01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:51.820]   The shadow comes because our human nature
[01:04:51.820 --> 01:04:55.000]   is thrust into various social situations.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.600]   We can't help but have a shadow.
[01:04:57.980 --> 01:04:59.980]   We have to socialize a child.
[01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:01.580]   We learn to use a knife and a fork
[01:05:01.580 --> 01:05:04.740]   and not take our siblings' food and that sort of thing.
[01:05:04.740 --> 01:05:06.960]   You learn to look both ways before you cross the street.
[01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:08.940]   There's socialization that's important,
[01:05:08.940 --> 01:05:11.820]   and yet the greater the socialization,
[01:05:11.820 --> 01:05:13.900]   the more likely there's gonna be an interruption.
[01:05:13.900 --> 01:05:16.260]   I mean, think about those cultures
[01:05:16.260 --> 01:05:18.260]   where people are forced to dress alike
[01:05:18.260 --> 01:05:21.840]   for some form of unity or conformity.
[01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:25.780]   Think about where a person might have
[01:05:25.780 --> 01:05:27.340]   a special gift or talent,
[01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:31.220]   but it's not appreciated in family X or Y.
[01:05:31.220 --> 01:05:35.780]   Well, where does that natural form of expression go?
[01:05:35.780 --> 01:05:37.740]   It pathologizes as depression,
[01:05:37.740 --> 01:05:40.740]   or it comes out in compensatory dreams
[01:05:40.740 --> 01:05:42.780]   or in projections onto someone else,
[01:05:42.780 --> 01:05:45.660]   or it makes the person ill.
[01:05:45.660 --> 01:05:47.840]   The unlived life can make a person ill.
[01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:49.300]   There's a sickness unto death,
[01:05:49.300 --> 01:05:50.860]   as Kierkegaard talked about it.
[01:05:50.860 --> 01:05:55.340]   It's that sickness where the human spirit
[01:05:55.340 --> 01:05:58.260]   is being repetitively violated.
[01:05:58.260 --> 01:06:02.400]   And much in our culture violates our spirits.
[01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:04.820]   And spirit is not something you will.
[01:06:04.820 --> 01:06:07.100]   It's something that is the quickening
[01:06:07.100 --> 01:06:09.860]   of life's energy in service to something.
[01:06:09.860 --> 01:06:12.700]   And if your family or your situation
[01:06:12.700 --> 01:06:16.040]   imposes itself upon that.
[01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:17.260]   To give a quick example,
[01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:22.140]   my own family of origin was one in which they were,
[01:06:22.140 --> 01:06:24.740]   by the circumstances of decades ago,
[01:06:24.740 --> 01:06:27.300]   unable to attain an education.
[01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:28.500]   My father worked in a factory.
[01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:30.700]   My mother was a secretary.
[01:06:30.700 --> 01:06:35.700]   And for them, life was a series of shaming events
[01:06:35.700 --> 01:06:39.660]   and overwhelming events.
[01:06:39.660 --> 01:06:42.140]   And the message to me, both overt and covert,
[01:06:42.140 --> 01:06:43.420]   is don't go out there.
[01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:45.540]   It's too big.
[01:06:45.540 --> 01:06:46.940]   It's too much.
[01:06:46.940 --> 01:06:49.540]   Stay here and we'll take care of each other.
[01:06:49.540 --> 01:06:52.900]   So one of the first things I did when I was 18 was left.
[01:06:52.900 --> 01:06:55.580]   I went to college and came back for vacations.
[01:06:55.580 --> 01:06:58.420]   But I left psychologically at that point.
[01:06:58.420 --> 01:07:01.460]   Something in me knew that I had to have
[01:07:01.460 --> 01:07:02.740]   a larger life than that.
[01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:04.620]   And I say that with love and respect
[01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:07.540]   and compassion for my parents.
[01:07:07.540 --> 01:07:10.000]   The last conversation I had with my mother
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.560]   before she died of cancer,
[01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:15.460]   her ancestor, the father she'd never known,
[01:07:15.460 --> 01:07:17.260]   was from Sweden.
[01:07:17.260 --> 01:07:20.780]   And I'd had a book translated into Swedish.
[01:07:20.780 --> 01:07:22.500]   And I told her I thought that would be something
[01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:24.540]   that would be nice for her.
[01:07:24.540 --> 01:07:26.500]   And she was horrified.
[01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:28.720]   It's like, why have you written it?
[01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:30.860]   What are they saying?
[01:07:30.860 --> 01:07:33.260]   And I thought she meant reviewers at first.
[01:07:33.260 --> 01:07:36.420]   And I realized that's the voice I heard in childhood.
[01:07:36.420 --> 01:07:38.500]   She was saying, you shouldn't be out there.
[01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:41.780]   Now people are going to attack you.
[01:07:41.780 --> 01:07:45.020]   This will draw attention to you, you see.
[01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:48.100]   And her intention was protective.
[01:07:48.100 --> 01:07:51.700]   In her last days, actually, before she died,
[01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:55.740]   she was more afraid of what people thought
[01:07:55.740 --> 01:07:59.020]   than whether her son was living his journey or not.
[01:07:59.020 --> 01:08:02.380]   And I say this with grief for her.
[01:08:02.380 --> 01:08:05.420]   And that was the message of childhood.
[01:08:05.420 --> 01:08:07.740]   It's too much out there.
[01:08:07.740 --> 01:08:11.780]   And yet, something inside quickened and said,
[01:08:11.780 --> 01:08:14.620]   well, you need to go where those airplanes are going.
[01:08:14.620 --> 01:08:16.900]   You need to go see the ocean for yourself.
[01:08:16.900 --> 01:08:19.460]   You need to try to live in a foreign country
[01:08:19.460 --> 01:08:20.740]   and see what that's like.
[01:08:21.580 --> 01:08:23.580]   Was I, was that easy?
[01:08:23.580 --> 01:08:27.820]   No, it was doubly hard because of the messages I had.
[01:08:27.820 --> 01:08:30.020]   But it was just necessary.
[01:08:30.020 --> 01:08:33.300]   Sooner or later, again, the appointment with your life,
[01:08:33.300 --> 01:08:36.140]   do you keep it or do you not keep the appointment?
[01:08:36.140 --> 01:08:38.780]   So that was the first meeting of the appointment
[01:08:38.780 --> 01:08:42.580]   was to leave home and start the journey.
[01:08:42.580 --> 01:08:46.740]   You know, in terms of the archetype of the journey,
[01:08:46.740 --> 01:08:48.860]   first is the departure.
[01:08:48.860 --> 01:08:50.980]   And then you have the initiatory experiences
[01:08:50.980 --> 01:08:52.380]   which can knock you down.
[01:08:52.380 --> 01:08:53.380]   And then the question is,
[01:08:53.380 --> 01:08:56.260]   do you get up and go to the next one?
[01:08:56.260 --> 01:08:59.340]   And sooner or later, something begins to change inside
[01:08:59.340 --> 01:09:02.820]   and you begin to feel that this is the journey
[01:09:02.820 --> 01:09:03.900]   that's right for me.
[01:09:03.900 --> 01:09:07.060]   - It's very moving to hear because I, you know,
[01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:09.980]   we hear that we become our parents.
[01:09:09.980 --> 01:09:11.660]   And yet I've never believed that.
[01:09:11.660 --> 01:09:17.860]   I believe that for whatever reason inside us,
[01:09:18.820 --> 01:09:23.820]   that we either adopt their traits unconsciously
[01:09:23.820 --> 01:09:26.620]   or consciously,
[01:09:26.620 --> 01:09:30.380]   or we resist them 180 degrees in the other direction.
[01:09:30.380 --> 01:09:33.140]   There doesn't seem to be a 90 degree response
[01:09:33.140 --> 01:09:36.960]   as your example beautifully illustrates.
[01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:38.900]   That there's something in the brain
[01:09:38.900 --> 01:09:43.620]   and in the human psyche that either says, yeah, okay.
[01:09:43.620 --> 01:09:46.980]   Like that's just the way life is for better or worse.
[01:09:48.580 --> 01:09:50.040]   Or says no.
[01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:54.180]   And, you know, I feel I'm 48 years old.
[01:09:54.180 --> 01:09:57.340]   So I'm still learning to be a full adult.
[01:09:57.340 --> 01:10:00.820]   I like to think there's some neuroplasticity left.
[01:10:00.820 --> 01:10:02.620]   Science tells us there's neuroplasticity
[01:10:02.620 --> 01:10:03.860]   throughout the lifespan.
[01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:05.420]   So I do believe that.
[01:10:05.420 --> 01:10:09.180]   But I feel like so much of being an adult,
[01:10:09.180 --> 01:10:11.340]   perhaps just being a human being,
[01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:16.340]   is about learning to stand one's ground and say, no,
[01:10:17.180 --> 01:10:18.660]   no, no, no, that's me.
[01:10:18.660 --> 01:10:20.020]   And this is what's right for me.
[01:10:20.020 --> 01:10:24.580]   And you're wrong, crazy, or just different.
[01:10:24.580 --> 01:10:26.580]   And we agree to disagree.
[01:10:26.580 --> 01:10:28.320]   And then there's the other half of being an adult,
[01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:33.080]   which is saying, oh goodness, you might be right.
[01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:35.820]   Maybe you are right.
[01:10:35.820 --> 01:10:36.780]   Okay, you're right.
[01:10:36.780 --> 01:10:41.780]   I screwed up or I need to think,
[01:10:41.780 --> 01:10:44.060]   at least think about this differently.
[01:10:44.060 --> 01:10:47.840]   And the hard work of being a human, I think,
[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:52.840]   is knowing when you are dealing with incoming messages
[01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:58.740]   that are real, they could be from a healthy source
[01:10:58.740 --> 01:11:01.620]   or an unhealthy source, it's complicated.
[01:11:01.620 --> 01:11:03.500]   And this is why I mentioned this thing about the internet
[01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:05.140]   and social media in particular earlier.
[01:11:05.140 --> 01:11:06.820]   I do believe it's borderline.
[01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:11.820]   I think if you were to remove the names and the faces
[01:11:11.900 --> 01:11:15.500]   and you would just put that into a script,
[01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:17.100]   you'd say, this is a dialogue
[01:11:17.100 --> 01:11:19.220]   coming from a borderline person,
[01:11:19.220 --> 01:11:21.460]   weaving back and forth across the line,
[01:11:21.460 --> 01:11:25.040]   literally of healthy and psychotic.
[01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:28.100]   And so as a human, especially nowadays, it's complicated.
[01:11:28.100 --> 01:11:31.700]   We don't just live in little villages where we go,
[01:11:31.700 --> 01:11:34.460]   okay, well, that person tends to kind of spin off
[01:11:34.460 --> 01:11:36.580]   and that person seems very grounded,
[01:11:36.580 --> 01:11:38.340]   but occasionally makes mistakes too.
[01:11:38.340 --> 01:11:40.940]   And so I feel like so much of the work
[01:11:40.940 --> 01:11:42.660]   of being a, I said an adult,
[01:11:42.660 --> 01:11:45.060]   but I'm going to replace that with just a human
[01:11:45.060 --> 01:11:49.140]   is trying to know thyself, right, as the Oracle said,
[01:11:49.140 --> 01:11:53.520]   and own thyself and report that into the world,
[01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:56.380]   but also to be semi-permeable in a way that's functional
[01:11:56.380 --> 01:12:00.300]   is such hard work because in both cases,
[01:12:00.300 --> 01:12:05.080]   the adoption of what we were told
[01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:07.620]   and what was ingrained in us and is unconscious
[01:12:07.620 --> 01:12:10.300]   so that we just live out the script of our parents
[01:12:10.300 --> 01:12:13.660]   or where we say, no, I'm going to leave this little town
[01:12:13.660 --> 01:12:16.660]   or I'm not going to live life or relationships
[01:12:16.660 --> 01:12:17.540]   that way at all.
[01:12:17.540 --> 01:12:19.620]   I'm going to do it this other completely different way,
[01:12:19.620 --> 01:12:21.540]   maybe unconventional way.
[01:12:21.540 --> 01:12:24.740]   Both have an element of reactivity in them
[01:12:24.740 --> 01:12:28.160]   and certainly both have an element of kind of,
[01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:33.100]   there's like, there's a vigor behind it.
[01:12:33.100 --> 01:12:35.020]   - Sure.
[01:12:35.020 --> 01:12:38.720]   No, your point is very well taken and appropriate
[01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:40.180]   because it is a paradox.
[01:12:40.180 --> 01:12:44.300]   First of all, in the Eden Project,
[01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:46.020]   a book I wrote on relationship
[01:12:46.020 --> 01:12:49.020]   and subtitled The Search for the Magical Leather,
[01:12:49.020 --> 01:12:52.260]   there is inside of us this infantile
[01:12:52.260 --> 01:12:55.460]   and understandable desire to find the right person
[01:12:55.460 --> 01:12:57.940]   who's going to make our life work for us,
[01:12:57.940 --> 01:12:59.980]   who's going to take care of us, meet our needs,
[01:12:59.980 --> 01:13:03.020]   read our minds, et cetera, et cetera, you see,
[01:13:03.020 --> 01:13:05.740]   and the other person has that going on in them
[01:13:05.740 --> 01:13:07.260]   so they project that onto us.
[01:13:07.260 --> 01:13:11.220]   You wonder why relationships get so complexed, you see,
[01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:15.260]   but the great gift of relationship, if you can tolerate it,
[01:13:15.260 --> 01:13:19.100]   is the otherness of the other produces the dialectic,
[01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:21.540]   produces the enlargement
[01:13:21.540 --> 01:13:23.820]   that comes from encountering the other.
[01:13:23.820 --> 01:13:25.700]   I've learned so much from my wife
[01:13:25.700 --> 01:13:28.140]   and I believe she's learned a few things from me.
[01:13:28.140 --> 01:13:32.180]   Our ongoing dialogue, 'cause we're both similar
[01:13:32.180 --> 01:13:34.820]   and very different at the same time,
[01:13:34.820 --> 01:13:38.780]   is one that has at times been conflictual, naturally,
[01:13:38.780 --> 01:13:41.700]   but most of the time is a pattern of growth
[01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:45.420]   because we are allowed to bring in that other perspective
[01:13:45.420 --> 01:13:47.140]   and see the same reality.
[01:13:47.140 --> 01:13:49.660]   My wife has taught me to see some things
[01:13:49.660 --> 01:13:50.940]   that I wouldn't have seen before
[01:13:50.940 --> 01:13:52.940]   'cause she has an artist's eye.
[01:13:52.940 --> 01:13:56.740]   On the other hand, there are places where you have to come up
[01:13:56.740 --> 01:13:59.340]   as you said, against what is central and critical
[01:13:59.340 --> 01:14:02.140]   to your own well-being or your own integrity
[01:14:02.140 --> 01:14:04.100]   and then you have to stand for that
[01:14:04.100 --> 01:14:07.540]   and the wisdom to know which is which at any given time
[01:14:07.540 --> 01:14:10.580]   is not inbred, it's one of those times
[01:14:10.580 --> 01:14:13.620]   where we have to find that balancing point
[01:14:13.620 --> 01:14:16.740]   between legitimate dialogue and compromise
[01:14:16.740 --> 01:14:18.740]   and sacrifice in a relationship.
[01:14:18.740 --> 01:14:20.940]   There's a place for sacrifice,
[01:14:20.940 --> 01:14:22.820]   but at the same time, there's a place
[01:14:22.820 --> 01:14:24.500]   where you have to say, all right,
[01:14:24.500 --> 01:14:27.100]   but I also have to separate myself here
[01:14:27.100 --> 01:14:30.420]   and stand for this on the other side of that.
[01:14:30.420 --> 01:14:33.100]   And it takes a Solomonic wisdom
[01:14:33.100 --> 01:14:35.740]   to know always what's right, but over time,
[01:14:35.740 --> 01:14:39.380]   I think one can get a sense of what that's about.
[01:14:39.380 --> 01:14:44.260]   So again, that's why we have to individuate
[01:14:44.260 --> 01:14:49.260]   as individuals by definition, but also in relationship
[01:14:49.260 --> 01:14:51.020]   because it's the otherness of the others
[01:14:51.020 --> 01:14:53.700]   that pulls us out of that self-referential system.
[01:14:53.700 --> 01:14:57.580]   Otherwise, we get caught in a circular dialogue
[01:14:57.580 --> 01:14:59.460]   among our complexes, for example.
[01:14:59.460 --> 01:15:01.700]   As Jung said, it's important to go to the mountaintop
[01:15:01.700 --> 01:15:04.060]   to meditate, but if you stay up there too long,
[01:15:04.060 --> 01:15:05.500]   you'll be talking to ghosts.
[01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:11.180]   Your complexes will be caught in this looping cycle
[01:15:11.180 --> 01:15:13.580]   and you need the other to pull you out of that
[01:15:13.580 --> 01:15:15.460]   into the presence of the other,
[01:15:15.460 --> 01:15:17.780]   and it's out of that that the third comes.
[01:15:17.780 --> 01:15:21.220]   Joseph Campbell made an important distinction once.
[01:15:21.220 --> 01:15:23.740]   He said about committed relationship.
[01:15:23.740 --> 01:15:26.740]   He said if you're constantly sacrificing to the other,
[01:15:26.740 --> 01:15:29.980]   you'll grow resentful.
[01:15:30.860 --> 01:15:32.900]   But if you're sacrificing to the project
[01:15:32.900 --> 01:15:36.380]   the two of you have launched together as a friendship
[01:15:36.380 --> 01:15:38.860]   or a marriage or whatever form it takes,
[01:15:38.860 --> 01:15:41.140]   you can do that in a very constructive way.
[01:15:41.140 --> 01:15:44.980]   You're fed by that because you're mutually committed
[01:15:44.980 --> 01:15:49.180]   to the project that this relationship represents.
[01:15:49.180 --> 01:15:51.420]   And that's an important distinction, I think.
[01:15:51.420 --> 01:15:55.700]   - Yeah, given that 50% or more of marriages
[01:15:55.700 --> 01:15:57.420]   seem to end in divorce these days,
[01:15:57.420 --> 01:16:00.020]   I think that statistic still holds.
[01:16:00.020 --> 01:16:03.060]   Do you think that can be largely attributed
[01:16:03.060 --> 01:16:06.780]   to people not arriving to those relationships
[01:16:06.780 --> 01:16:08.580]   with the mindset you just described,
[01:16:08.580 --> 01:16:10.380]   people not arriving to those relationships
[01:16:10.380 --> 01:16:13.860]   having a deep enough understanding of themselves
[01:16:13.860 --> 01:16:18.100]   prior to that or something else?
[01:16:18.100 --> 01:16:19.940]   - I think all of the above.
[01:16:19.940 --> 01:16:21.980]   First of all, young people tend to marry
[01:16:21.980 --> 01:16:24.460]   and make babies, understandably.
[01:16:24.460 --> 01:16:27.260]   And then 20 years later,
[01:16:27.260 --> 01:16:29.660]   in some way they're a different person.
[01:16:29.660 --> 01:16:32.020]   And it's very hard for the premises
[01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:34.180]   that brought them together to still obtain
[01:16:34.180 --> 01:16:39.180]   in a developmental and honest way many years later.
[01:16:39.180 --> 01:16:43.020]   When you reach that point,
[01:16:43.020 --> 01:16:45.420]   then there's a time for renegotiation
[01:16:45.420 --> 01:16:47.340]   or if need be, unfortunately,
[01:16:47.340 --> 01:16:49.380]   the dissolution of that relationship.
[01:16:49.380 --> 01:16:54.020]   Because I had a colleague in New Jersey years ago
[01:16:54.020 --> 01:16:55.500]   who worked exclusively with the couples
[01:16:55.500 --> 01:16:57.740]   and she talked about starter marriages.
[01:16:57.740 --> 01:16:59.380]   And she said, "I would never say that publicly
[01:16:59.380 --> 01:17:02.460]   because that sounded too pessimistic."
[01:17:02.460 --> 01:17:04.060]   But she said, "If you're lucky,
[01:17:04.060 --> 01:17:05.860]   your starter marriage will be a good one
[01:17:05.860 --> 01:17:07.420]   that will evolve and so forth."
[01:17:07.420 --> 01:17:09.620]   But for most people,
[01:17:09.620 --> 01:17:11.860]   that which brought them together
[01:17:11.860 --> 01:17:14.260]   was running from their parents
[01:17:14.260 --> 01:17:17.140]   or replicating their parents' relationships
[01:17:17.140 --> 01:17:20.540]   or their insecurity about themselves.
[01:17:20.540 --> 01:17:22.100]   Therefore, they bonded with someone else
[01:17:22.100 --> 01:17:23.580]   who was gonna take care of that for them.
[01:17:23.580 --> 01:17:27.580]   Whatever it was, it's been outlived.
[01:17:27.580 --> 01:17:29.860]   Their own natural development,
[01:17:29.860 --> 01:17:31.980]   their life circumstances have changed.
[01:17:31.980 --> 01:17:35.140]   And then it brings about the necessity
[01:17:35.140 --> 01:17:37.020]   of some very difficult decisions.
[01:17:37.020 --> 01:17:42.020]   So marriage is an institution
[01:17:42.020 --> 01:17:44.700]   with the best of intentions
[01:17:44.700 --> 01:17:47.540]   that is sorely tested over time.
[01:17:47.540 --> 01:17:50.580]   And sometimes it'll survive the test.
[01:17:50.580 --> 01:17:52.420]   I would not automatically applaud
[01:17:52.420 --> 01:17:55.180]   if somebody's been married 50 or 60 years.
[01:17:55.180 --> 01:17:58.340]   I would ask what has happened to the soul of that person
[01:17:58.340 --> 01:18:00.660]   in that relationship?
[01:18:00.660 --> 01:18:01.620]   Has it grown?
[01:18:01.620 --> 01:18:02.540]   Has it developed?
[01:18:02.540 --> 01:18:05.420]   Did they mutually support each other's growth
[01:18:05.420 --> 01:18:06.620]   and development?
[01:18:06.620 --> 01:18:09.860]   Or did something get stuck at that point?
[01:18:09.860 --> 01:18:14.860]   And are our early family of origin dynamics
[01:18:14.860 --> 01:18:17.140]   still dominating that relationship?
[01:18:17.140 --> 01:18:18.100]   And from the outside,
[01:18:18.100 --> 01:18:20.780]   we usually don't know the answer to that question.
[01:18:20.780 --> 01:18:22.140]   But inside, you'd have to say,
[01:18:22.460 --> 01:18:24.300]   what has happened to this person?
[01:18:24.300 --> 01:18:27.820]   And the same is true with parenting.
[01:18:27.820 --> 01:18:29.660]   Parenting is very, very difficult
[01:18:29.660 --> 01:18:32.340]   because we'd like to think we know what's right
[01:18:32.340 --> 01:18:33.540]   for our own child,
[01:18:33.540 --> 01:18:36.180]   but then they have to spend a good part of their life
[01:18:36.180 --> 01:18:38.500]   trying to get away from us in some way,
[01:18:38.500 --> 01:18:40.860]   as we did ourselves, you see?
[01:18:40.860 --> 01:18:42.780]   And then if you remember that,
[01:18:42.780 --> 01:18:44.940]   then you're a little more likely to say,
[01:18:44.940 --> 01:18:46.820]   I really don't know what's going on here,
[01:18:46.820 --> 01:18:48.180]   but I have to pay more attention
[01:18:48.180 --> 01:18:51.780]   to what I think is wanting expression through my child.
[01:18:51.780 --> 01:18:55.060]   And support that rather than assuming
[01:18:55.060 --> 01:18:55.900]   that they're gonna grow up
[01:18:55.900 --> 01:18:58.300]   and replicate our lives and our values,
[01:18:58.300 --> 01:18:59.860]   as I've said before.
[01:18:59.860 --> 01:19:02.940]   - Given the number of people
[01:19:02.940 --> 01:19:05.620]   who do deep introspective work,
[01:19:05.620 --> 01:19:08.940]   either by themselves or with a trained professional,
[01:19:08.940 --> 01:19:10.580]   perhaps should surprise us
[01:19:10.580 --> 01:19:13.140]   that 50% of marriages do survive.
[01:19:13.140 --> 01:19:14.700]   - Yeah, in a way, yes.
[01:19:14.700 --> 01:19:18.580]   And those that survive are not necessarily good marriages
[01:19:18.580 --> 01:19:21.660]   in the sense in which the person is growing and developing.
[01:19:21.660 --> 01:19:22.580]   They may be stuck,
[01:19:22.580 --> 01:19:24.140]   they may be afraid of the alternatives,
[01:19:24.140 --> 01:19:26.620]   they may be bound by economics, for example,
[01:19:26.620 --> 01:19:29.020]   or cultural forms.
[01:19:29.020 --> 01:19:30.180]   So again, from outside,
[01:19:30.180 --> 01:19:31.500]   you don't know what's happening
[01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:33.500]   inside the soul of that individual.
[01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:34.580]   And it's very important for us
[01:19:34.580 --> 01:19:36.300]   to not judge them for that reason.
[01:19:36.300 --> 01:19:40.860]   - Earlier, you described the painful work,
[01:19:40.860 --> 01:19:42.100]   sometimes painful work,
[01:19:42.100 --> 01:19:45.060]   of really addressing what one wants
[01:19:45.060 --> 01:19:48.480]   and really getting in touch with one's soul, psyche.
[01:19:50.140 --> 01:19:53.260]   And how society, or we think society,
[01:19:53.260 --> 01:19:55.740]   might not approve of that.
[01:19:55.740 --> 01:19:58.640]   And yet, when I think about popular culture,
[01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:02.140]   oftentimes it's the people
[01:20:02.140 --> 01:20:06.020]   that seem to be living in their own truth
[01:20:06.020 --> 01:20:08.180]   that are most celebrated.
[01:20:08.180 --> 01:20:09.020]   - That's true.
[01:20:09.020 --> 01:20:12.140]   - Like there's something about the crowd,
[01:20:12.140 --> 01:20:13.920]   I've shifted from mob to crowd here
[01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:15.220]   to make it sound more benevolent,
[01:20:15.220 --> 01:20:18.860]   but it's still a mob that cheers on the person
[01:20:18.860 --> 01:20:20.820]   who really seems to be in their,
[01:20:20.820 --> 01:20:23.740]   we say full expression or living in their truth,
[01:20:23.740 --> 01:20:25.860]   but who just comes out and says like,
[01:20:25.860 --> 01:20:30.580]   "Yeah, I don't really care what they're saying about me
[01:20:30.580 --> 01:20:31.420]   "or what people think.
[01:20:31.420 --> 01:20:34.460]   "I know me, I know my own goodness,
[01:20:34.460 --> 01:20:37.780]   "my own intention, my own mission.
[01:20:37.780 --> 01:20:39.260]   "And the people close to me do."
[01:20:39.260 --> 01:20:41.220]   Hopefully they have people close to them.
[01:20:41.220 --> 01:20:45.260]   And we say, "Yeah, like go."
[01:20:45.260 --> 01:20:46.460]   It's inspiring.
[01:20:46.460 --> 01:20:48.080]   - Yes, that's why I said earlier,
[01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:50.700]   many of the people in history that we would admire
[01:20:50.700 --> 01:20:52.060]   had difficult lives,
[01:20:52.060 --> 01:20:55.980]   but we admire them because they stuck to some value
[01:20:55.980 --> 01:20:57.740]   that was central to who they were.
[01:20:57.740 --> 01:21:00.100]   And they lived that maybe at great cost,
[01:21:00.100 --> 01:21:03.060]   but they lived that through whatever suffering
[01:21:03.060 --> 01:21:05.460]   they had to experience.
[01:21:05.460 --> 01:21:08.900]   Again, from outside, we don't know, do we?
[01:21:08.900 --> 01:21:11.900]   When we see some cultural figure out there,
[01:21:11.900 --> 01:21:14.540]   maybe they're manipulative,
[01:21:14.540 --> 01:21:16.980]   maybe they're caught in a complex of some kind.
[01:21:16.980 --> 01:21:19.200]   We don't know from outside.
[01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:22.560]   You have to say, I mean, one of the shadow issues
[01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:24.920]   is how often people will live through a celebrity
[01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:27.640]   or live through a pop figure in some way,
[01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:29.420]   maybe imitate that person.
[01:21:29.420 --> 01:21:33.020]   Again, for a child that's natural and normal.
[01:21:33.020 --> 01:21:36.480]   On the other hand, sooner or later, you have to say,
[01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:38.720]   "But my journey is a different journey.
[01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:42.840]   "Maybe they're living theirs, but am I living mine?"
[01:21:42.840 --> 01:21:45.200]   And I don't mean this in any grandiose way.
[01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:47.680]   I don't mean that they have to go out and become something
[01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:49.680]   that's noted in the society,
[01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:51.640]   but to live in accord with something
[01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:54.800]   that is wishing its expression through us.
[01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:57.760]   That's why I said the final question in life
[01:21:57.760 --> 01:22:01.920]   is what is wanting to live in this world through me
[01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:05.320]   rather than what do I want, or what do my complexes want?
[01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:08.400]   Because they're noisy chatterers in there.
[01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:10.740]   I had a dear friend from another state
[01:22:10.740 --> 01:22:12.040]   write to me just yesterday,
[01:22:12.040 --> 01:22:15.400]   and he's in semi-retirement now
[01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:17.120]   and he's been dealing with some health issues,
[01:22:17.120 --> 01:22:21.740]   and he said, "Now that I'm not distracted,
[01:22:21.740 --> 01:22:24.100]   "I have time to work on all the goblins of the past
[01:22:24.100 --> 01:22:25.240]   "that I left behind."
[01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:27.000]   And he's an analyst.
[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.320]   So it's not like we get rid of these things.
[01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:30.560]   They're lifelong.
[01:22:30.560 --> 01:22:33.180]   This is why Jung said, "We can't solve these things,
[01:22:33.180 --> 01:22:34.400]   "but we can outgrow them."
[01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:36.080]   There's a big difference.
[01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:39.140]   You become larger than what happened to you, for example.
[01:22:39.140 --> 01:22:41.640]   You become larger than that voice inside of you
[01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:44.680]   that says you can do this, but you can't do that.
[01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:48.520]   And over time, something inside of you
[01:22:48.520 --> 01:22:51.120]   is wishing that growth and pushing that,
[01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:53.500]   and again, pathologizes when that's blocked.
[01:22:53.500 --> 01:22:57.160]   So people can be doing all the right things
[01:22:57.160 --> 01:23:01.280]   as defined by their values and their environment,
[01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:03.300]   and it violates something inside.
[01:23:03.300 --> 01:23:06.520]   That's why we can be, quote, successful and achieve things,
[01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:08.620]   and it still feels empty.
[01:23:08.620 --> 01:23:09.960]   There's no there there.
[01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:11.760]   You know, you get to the top of the ladder,
[01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:14.360]   and you realize there's no there there.
[01:23:14.360 --> 01:23:16.520]   And that happens so often in our culture.
[01:23:16.520 --> 01:23:21.280]   I remember one of the fiscal figures
[01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:23.560]   in the late 20th century
[01:23:23.560 --> 01:23:27.160]   who had a personal fortune of $400 million,
[01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:30.160]   and he was asked what was his philosophy of life,
[01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:32.420]   and he said, "Well, at the end of life,
[01:23:32.420 --> 01:23:34.760]   "the person with the biggest pile wins."
[01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:37.480]   And I remember thinking, how infantile is that?
[01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:38.860]   This was a smart man.
[01:23:39.700 --> 01:23:42.420]   An elder statesman in his field,
[01:23:42.420 --> 01:23:44.920]   ultimately went to prison because of some things,
[01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:49.660]   but that's the philosophy of the sandbox.
[01:23:49.660 --> 01:23:51.100]   I have the biggest pile of sand.
[01:23:51.100 --> 01:23:51.940]   I've won.
[01:23:51.940 --> 01:23:53.500]   No, you haven't won, you're dead.
[01:23:53.500 --> 01:23:55.660]   And it's a pile of sand.
[01:23:55.660 --> 01:23:57.340]   What are you talking about?
[01:23:57.340 --> 01:23:59.500]   And yet, this is what drove the man's life,
[01:23:59.500 --> 01:24:02.740]   and obviously drove him across enough lines
[01:24:02.740 --> 01:24:06.660]   that it got him into legal troubles sooner or later.
[01:24:06.660 --> 01:24:08.300]   And again, I say that without judgment.
[01:24:08.300 --> 01:24:11.380]   I'm just saying here's an example
[01:24:11.380 --> 01:24:14.020]   of a very achieved person
[01:24:14.020 --> 01:24:17.220]   who's been living an infantile philosophy,
[01:24:17.220 --> 01:24:19.460]   and as such, something else causes him
[01:24:19.460 --> 01:24:20.900]   to pay greatly for that.
[01:24:20.900 --> 01:24:23.960]   - Yeah, well, I certainly can say that
[01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:29.220]   despite having pursued work with a lot of vigor and career,
[01:24:29.220 --> 01:24:31.820]   that without question,
[01:24:31.820 --> 01:24:36.380]   friendships and relationships are the most important thing.
[01:24:36.380 --> 01:24:41.300]   There's just no question, especially when things get hard.
[01:24:41.300 --> 01:24:42.140]   - That's right.
[01:24:42.140 --> 01:24:46.100]   - I actually have a list in this very book,
[01:24:46.100 --> 01:24:47.380]   I won't flip to it now,
[01:24:47.380 --> 01:24:49.740]   of the people that I'm just really blessed
[01:24:49.740 --> 01:24:52.380]   to call close friends, like real friends
[01:24:52.380 --> 01:24:53.380]   that you can count on.
[01:24:53.380 --> 01:24:55.460]   And to me, it seems, and I've always,
[01:24:55.460 --> 01:24:56.780]   my sister, I have an older sister,
[01:24:56.780 --> 01:24:58.760]   and she always said, "You've always been a pack animal."
[01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:03.300]   I've always had big groups of, big-ish groups of friends,
[01:25:03.300 --> 01:25:04.860]   and it's something I've invested in heavily,
[01:25:04.860 --> 01:25:07.500]   sometimes to the expense of other things,
[01:25:07.500 --> 01:25:09.260]   including work and other relationships.
[01:25:09.260 --> 01:25:14.260]   But the notion that the material things
[01:25:14.260 --> 01:25:19.780]   or that the opinions of strangers would somehow fill us,
[01:25:19.780 --> 01:25:23.340]   that to me is like the most foreign concept.
[01:25:23.340 --> 01:25:24.180]   - Sure.
[01:25:24.180 --> 01:25:25.500]   - Like that's the most foreign concept.
[01:25:25.500 --> 01:25:29.140]   But clearly some people operate on those metrics.
[01:25:29.140 --> 01:25:30.460]   That's like- - Of course.
[01:25:30.460 --> 01:25:35.460]   - And my guess is that they have a reward horizon
[01:25:35.460 --> 01:25:38.340]   that is, you know, tacked to whatever it is
[01:25:38.340 --> 01:25:40.740]   the algorithms are that get them that thing.
[01:25:40.740 --> 01:25:42.540]   And so it must feed some reward mechanism
[01:25:42.540 --> 01:25:43.860]   that has them distracted enough,
[01:25:43.860 --> 01:25:46.860]   like locked into this one mode of time perception.
[01:25:46.860 --> 01:25:48.740]   You know, just hit the mile mark, hit the mile mark,
[01:25:48.740 --> 01:25:51.180]   hit the mile mark, so that they're not aware.
[01:25:51.180 --> 01:25:52.420]   But when you take somebody like that,
[01:25:52.420 --> 01:25:53.620]   who's been doing that for a lifetime,
[01:25:53.620 --> 01:25:56.140]   and you say, "Wait, you know, you're on this track
[01:25:56.140 --> 01:25:58.860]   "going around and around and accruing trophies,
[01:25:58.860 --> 01:26:01.300]   "but actually that track doesn't go anywhere,
[01:26:01.300 --> 01:26:02.940]   "it doesn't lead you into the world."
[01:26:02.940 --> 01:26:03.780]   - That's right.
[01:26:03.780 --> 01:26:06.580]   - My guess is that they just, they've been doing it so long
[01:26:06.580 --> 01:26:09.420]   that they're like an animal that's just been, you know,
[01:26:09.420 --> 01:26:13.540]   digging a trench in its zoo-confined cage.
[01:26:13.540 --> 01:26:15.140]   - Which is something I'm finding
[01:26:15.140 --> 01:26:17.220]   with a lot of the men that I see.
[01:26:17.220 --> 01:26:20.900]   I happen to see right now in my practice,
[01:26:20.900 --> 01:26:25.900]   several men between 60 and 80, and one's 82.
[01:26:28.740 --> 01:26:31.140]   And of course they've been conditioned to work.
[01:26:31.140 --> 01:26:33.340]   And then suddenly, you know, on Monday morning,
[01:26:33.340 --> 01:26:34.820]   you don't have to stop and think who you are.
[01:26:34.820 --> 01:26:35.900]   You get up and you go to work
[01:26:35.900 --> 01:26:38.660]   and you do what you've done all these years.
[01:26:38.660 --> 01:26:40.420]   And then suddenly you don't do that.
[01:26:40.420 --> 01:26:41.260]   And what are you gonna do?
[01:26:41.260 --> 01:26:43.300]   Well, you say, "Well, I'm gonna go play golf every day."
[01:26:43.300 --> 01:26:44.820]   Well, okay, go do that.
[01:26:44.820 --> 01:26:47.460]   But typically, within three or four months,
[01:26:47.460 --> 01:26:49.500]   the depression comes, and they'll think about,
[01:26:49.500 --> 01:26:51.360]   "Well, I need to get back into doing this
[01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:53.020]   "or get doing that," you see.
[01:26:53.020 --> 01:26:58.580]   So often, we find people defined by exactly
[01:26:58.580 --> 01:26:59.780]   that kind of mentality.
[01:26:59.780 --> 01:27:02.340]   I've finished the first lap, so what do I do?
[01:27:02.340 --> 01:27:04.140]   Run another lap and run another lap.
[01:27:04.140 --> 01:27:05.820]   And you realize you keep coming back
[01:27:05.820 --> 01:27:08.460]   to the same starting point.
[01:27:08.460 --> 01:27:10.020]   That's why I say it's not what you do,
[01:27:10.020 --> 01:27:12.740]   it's what it's in service to inside that makes a difference.
[01:27:12.740 --> 01:27:17.060]   So is that person being successful by external standards?
[01:27:17.060 --> 01:27:19.140]   Yes, whatever that means.
[01:27:19.140 --> 01:27:21.980]   Does that mean that their psyche's gonna cooperate
[01:27:21.980 --> 01:27:23.840]   and give them that genuine sense
[01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:25.660]   of satisfaction in something?
[01:27:25.660 --> 01:27:26.700]   No, it won't.
[01:27:26.700 --> 01:27:27.820]   It's autonomous.
[01:27:27.820 --> 01:27:31.540]   It's not going to get co-opted into that.
[01:27:31.540 --> 01:27:34.740]   And sooner or later, chickens come home to roost,
[01:27:34.740 --> 01:27:38.020]   and then you have a depression, as I experienced,
[01:27:38.020 --> 01:27:41.600]   and/or you find your relationships
[01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:44.380]   are in tatters all around you.
[01:27:44.380 --> 01:27:48.860]   So sooner or later, I mean, no revelation on my part,
[01:27:48.860 --> 01:27:50.980]   nature will express itself.
[01:27:50.980 --> 01:27:54.300]   And if we live long enough,
[01:27:54.300 --> 01:27:57.220]   then everything that we pushed underground
[01:27:57.220 --> 01:27:58.500]   is gonna be coming up.
[01:27:58.500 --> 01:28:01.720]   - You mentioned men in particular.
[01:28:01.720 --> 01:28:03.340]   So now would probably be a good time
[01:28:03.340 --> 01:28:05.980]   to ask about men in particular.
[01:28:05.980 --> 01:28:07.580]   You wrote "Under Saturn's Shadow,"
[01:28:07.580 --> 01:28:09.620]   which is how I initially learned about your work.
[01:28:09.620 --> 01:28:12.460]   And then I listened to some of your lectures online.
[01:28:12.460 --> 01:28:15.980]   I'm still in the process of reading your other books.
[01:28:15.980 --> 01:28:20.660]   But let's talk about archetypes,
[01:28:20.660 --> 01:28:24.180]   stereotypes of men and women,
[01:28:24.180 --> 01:28:26.020]   with the intention, of course,
[01:28:26.020 --> 01:28:28.620]   of better understanding what's real
[01:28:28.620 --> 01:28:30.220]   as opposed to what's stereotype.
[01:28:30.220 --> 01:28:36.660]   So in the, let's call it the 1930s, '40s, '50s, '60s,
[01:28:36.660 --> 01:28:41.020]   view of men in the United States and elsewhere,
[01:28:41.020 --> 01:28:43.460]   there was this notion of kind of like the stoic
[01:28:43.460 --> 01:28:49.820]   and work and duty,
[01:28:50.300 --> 01:28:54.820]   and to some extent, a fair amount of mystique, right?
[01:28:54.820 --> 01:28:59.480]   Like it wasn't really, because with fewer words,
[01:28:59.480 --> 01:29:02.420]   we have less awareness at least of what people are saying,
[01:29:02.420 --> 01:29:03.860]   who knows what they're thinking,
[01:29:03.860 --> 01:29:05.700]   whether or not they talk a lot or not.
[01:29:05.700 --> 01:29:10.540]   But there was this idea of the male
[01:29:10.540 --> 01:29:14.660]   as somebody who did stuff, maybe thought about it,
[01:29:14.660 --> 01:29:17.900]   but didn't really talk about it much.
[01:29:18.940 --> 01:29:20.540]   Nowadays, things have changed.
[01:29:20.540 --> 01:29:24.640]   This is borne out in the statistics on college campuses
[01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:28.860]   about how many people seek therapy if they have an issue.
[01:29:28.860 --> 01:29:32.500]   It's gone from like 15% to 85 plus percent,
[01:29:32.500 --> 01:29:34.900]   at least roughly in the statistics I've seen.
[01:29:34.900 --> 01:29:40.500]   But in terms of males and their sense of duty
[01:29:40.500 --> 01:29:43.060]   and how they're supposed to be in the world,
[01:29:43.060 --> 01:29:45.540]   I would think just the way I just laid out
[01:29:45.540 --> 01:29:48.540]   the little, by all admittance,
[01:29:48.540 --> 01:29:53.140]   like just very antiquated now view of maleness,
[01:29:53.140 --> 01:29:58.560]   that they would be thinking a lot about what's going on.
[01:29:58.560 --> 01:30:00.680]   It would meet some of the daily practices
[01:30:00.680 --> 01:30:02.560]   that you talked about earlier,
[01:30:02.560 --> 01:30:04.020]   that there would be reflection,
[01:30:04.020 --> 01:30:06.980]   that there would be a consciousness,
[01:30:06.980 --> 01:30:11.500]   there would be an understanding of one shadow,
[01:30:11.500 --> 01:30:15.480]   or if one were to add in the other stereotype
[01:30:15.480 --> 01:30:17.280]   that went with it, that they drink a lot, right?
[01:30:17.280 --> 01:30:20.200]   That was very much, I'll remember my first,
[01:30:20.200 --> 01:30:21.740]   I went to graduate school first at Berkeley
[01:30:21.740 --> 01:30:23.860]   before I shifted to a different place.
[01:30:23.860 --> 01:30:28.500]   And I was told when I got there that it used to be
[01:30:28.500 --> 01:30:31.380]   that the faculty and graduate students,
[01:30:31.380 --> 01:30:34.500]   of which at that time in the 1970s and '60s
[01:30:34.500 --> 01:30:37.340]   was mostly male, mostly, now that's changed,
[01:30:37.340 --> 01:30:38.680]   fortunately, right?
[01:30:38.680 --> 01:30:42.840]   That they would meet every day after work to drink
[01:30:42.840 --> 01:30:45.780]   and then stagger home to their partners, every day.
[01:30:45.780 --> 01:30:47.060]   And I was shocked, I'm like, "Are you kidding me?"
[01:30:47.060 --> 01:30:48.460]   I was like, "No, every single day."
[01:30:48.460 --> 01:30:53.220]   So, you know, the idea here is that that was the old view.
[01:30:53.220 --> 01:30:55.060]   Now things are very different.
[01:30:55.060 --> 01:30:59.900]   But what about the work of men, men and boys,
[01:30:59.900 --> 01:31:03.160]   to try and understand their own psyche better?
[01:31:03.160 --> 01:31:07.300]   What are the things that are specific to them
[01:31:07.300 --> 01:31:08.300]   that you've talked about?
[01:31:08.300 --> 01:31:10.260]   And then we'll turn to women,
[01:31:10.260 --> 01:31:13.060]   and then we'll do our best to bridge the divide
[01:31:13.060 --> 01:31:14.100]   in a conversation.
[01:31:15.100 --> 01:31:19.500]   - Well, just to go back to our earlier conversation
[01:31:19.500 --> 01:31:21.620]   for a moment, you know,
[01:31:21.620 --> 01:31:25.380]   why would those men have to drink every day?
[01:31:25.380 --> 01:31:28.260]   And the answer is because there was some deep pain
[01:31:28.260 --> 01:31:31.060]   that they had to anesthetize,
[01:31:31.060 --> 01:31:33.320]   of which they were by and large unaware,
[01:31:33.320 --> 01:31:35.260]   or presumably they would have the opportunity
[01:31:35.260 --> 01:31:37.080]   to address whatever that was.
[01:31:37.080 --> 01:31:40.980]   You know, and I'll come back to that in a moment.
[01:31:40.980 --> 01:31:44.380]   I've been asked often to speak about men by women's groups.
[01:31:44.380 --> 01:31:46.780]   And by the way, men's groups have never asked me
[01:31:46.780 --> 01:31:48.340]   to talk about women, right?
[01:31:48.340 --> 01:31:49.180]   - Is that right?
[01:31:49.180 --> 01:31:50.000]   - That's right.
[01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:51.460]   You know, individuals such as yourself,
[01:31:51.460 --> 01:31:53.900]   but it's mostly women's groups have asked me
[01:31:53.900 --> 01:31:55.900]   to talk about those strange creatures called men.
[01:31:55.900 --> 01:31:58.540]   And I say, imagine these three things.
[01:31:58.540 --> 01:32:01.920]   First of all, that you cut away all your close friends,
[01:32:01.920 --> 01:32:04.780]   the women that you share your worries
[01:32:04.780 --> 01:32:07.060]   about your marriage with, about your children,
[01:32:07.060 --> 01:32:10.620]   about your body, your love life or lack thereof.
[01:32:10.620 --> 01:32:12.780]   You know, those people are gone forever.
[01:32:12.780 --> 01:32:14.980]   There's no one you can share that with.
[01:32:14.980 --> 01:32:18.540]   Secondly, you have to sever your link
[01:32:18.540 --> 01:32:20.700]   to whatever your guiding source may be.
[01:32:20.700 --> 01:32:22.660]   You call it your instinct or your intuition,
[01:32:22.660 --> 01:32:24.500]   whatever it is, that's cut off.
[01:32:24.500 --> 01:32:25.580]   It's not acceptable.
[01:32:25.580 --> 01:32:28.460]   And thirdly, your value as a human being
[01:32:28.460 --> 01:32:31.260]   will be defined by your meeting abstract standards
[01:32:31.260 --> 01:32:34.940]   of productivity as defined by total strangers
[01:32:34.940 --> 01:32:36.420]   in your culture.
[01:32:36.420 --> 01:32:39.860]   And sooner or later, no matter how much you win today,
[01:32:39.860 --> 01:32:41.220]   you'll wind up a loser.
[01:32:41.220 --> 01:32:43.740]   And the thing is you hold that off as long as you can.
[01:32:43.740 --> 01:32:46.020]   So keep running, right?
[01:32:46.020 --> 01:32:47.380]   And women hear that and they think,
[01:32:47.380 --> 01:32:49.940]   well, that's horrible, that's horrible.
[01:32:49.940 --> 01:32:52.840]   How lonely that would be, how isolating that would be.
[01:32:52.840 --> 01:32:55.780]   And of course it is, it's self-estranging.
[01:32:55.780 --> 01:32:58.500]   You know, my poor father was pulled out of the eighth grade,
[01:32:58.500 --> 01:33:00.220]   sent to work in the factory,
[01:33:00.220 --> 01:33:02.900]   worked all of his life in that factory.
[01:33:02.900 --> 01:33:06.460]   And by the standards of his day, he was a good man.
[01:33:06.460 --> 01:33:07.820]   He supported his family.
[01:33:07.820 --> 01:33:08.900]   He didn't run away.
[01:33:08.900 --> 01:33:11.780]   He accepted the responsibility.
[01:33:11.780 --> 01:33:14.380]   But I also know he didn't live with his own soul.
[01:33:14.380 --> 01:33:15.220]   I know that.
[01:33:15.220 --> 01:33:16.940]   And I had clues here and there.
[01:33:16.940 --> 01:33:18.580]   And I even saw that as a child.
[01:33:18.580 --> 01:33:24.340]   And so when I started to reflect on men,
[01:33:24.340 --> 01:33:28.820]   I realized I had my own inhibitions about that.
[01:33:28.820 --> 01:33:31.040]   And I was fortunately enough as a therapist,
[01:33:31.040 --> 01:33:33.500]   I would say, all right, what would you say
[01:33:33.500 --> 01:33:36.660]   to someone who expressed these inhibitions?
[01:33:36.660 --> 01:33:39.900]   And I would say, all right, there's some fears here
[01:33:39.900 --> 01:33:41.480]   that you're defending yourself against.
[01:33:41.480 --> 01:33:42.320]   What's that about?
[01:33:42.320 --> 01:33:45.020]   So I thought, and then I had a voice in me that said,
[01:33:45.020 --> 01:33:46.700]   but these are secret.
[01:33:46.700 --> 01:33:48.300]   You don't talk about it.
[01:33:48.300 --> 01:33:50.340]   And then I thought, well, that's my duty, isn't it?
[01:33:50.340 --> 01:33:52.580]   I have to bring some of those things up.
[01:33:52.580 --> 01:33:55.140]   And so that's what led to the writing of the book,
[01:33:55.140 --> 01:33:56.380]   "Understand Our Shadow."
[01:33:56.380 --> 01:34:01.140]   And I suggested a number of those secrets.
[01:34:01.140 --> 01:34:04.220]   One is men's lives are as much governed
[01:34:04.220 --> 01:34:07.260]   by role expectations as women's lives are,
[01:34:07.260 --> 01:34:10.800]   less so today, but in the past, they were ironclad, right?
[01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:16.060]   And the net effect of those roles was self-estranging.
[01:34:16.060 --> 01:34:18.920]   You are your function, you are your duties.
[01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:24.460]   Men's lives are governed by fear-based responses.
[01:34:24.460 --> 01:34:27.400]   And there's a certain level of competitiveness
[01:34:27.400 --> 01:34:29.740]   that is central to men's culture.
[01:34:29.740 --> 01:34:33.300]   Women learn through the years, probably out of necessity,
[01:34:33.300 --> 01:34:35.980]   to cooperate and support each other.
[01:34:35.980 --> 01:34:39.860]   And they can get through difficult things by doing that.
[01:34:39.860 --> 01:34:43.860]   For men, you're always having to demonstrate
[01:34:43.860 --> 01:34:46.460]   your competency in one area or another.
[01:34:46.460 --> 01:34:49.420]   And the one thing you don't wanna do is be a loser,
[01:34:49.420 --> 01:34:53.140]   you see, it's a zero-sum game, winners and losers.
[01:34:53.140 --> 01:34:58.140]   And ultimately, there's a deep, deep longing for,
[01:34:58.140 --> 01:35:02.560]   well, there's a fear of the feminine, so-called,
[01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:04.860]   that can include the feminine within,
[01:35:04.860 --> 01:35:08.260]   hence men's estranging themselves from themselves.
[01:35:08.260 --> 01:35:11.500]   I had a client many years ago who was sent into therapy
[01:35:11.500 --> 01:35:13.820]   by his wife saying, you know, either you go to therapy
[01:35:13.820 --> 01:35:15.300]   or I'm outta here.
[01:35:15.300 --> 01:35:17.460]   So he was there very reluctantly, and he walked in
[01:35:17.460 --> 01:35:20.700]   and he saw a box of tissue there, a Kleenex box,
[01:35:20.700 --> 01:35:25.020]   and he just kind of sniffed at that without saying anything.
[01:35:25.020 --> 01:35:26.780]   And I knew exactly what he was saying,
[01:35:26.780 --> 01:35:29.460]   but I acted like I didn't, and he thought I'd missed the clue
[01:35:29.460 --> 01:35:32.260]   and so he pointed the box and sniffed again.
[01:35:32.260 --> 01:35:34.060]   And I said, what's this about?
[01:35:34.060 --> 01:35:36.220]   And he said, well, you had a woman in here before,
[01:35:36.220 --> 01:35:38.260]   don't you, I'm not gonna be needing that.
[01:35:38.260 --> 01:35:42.680]   And I said, you know, every man has a lake of tears
[01:35:42.680 --> 01:35:45.620]   inside of himself and a mountain of anger in there.
[01:35:45.620 --> 01:35:47.460]   And I said, sooner or later.
[01:35:47.460 --> 01:35:49.260]   And he said, no, no, we have other,
[01:35:49.260 --> 01:35:50.780]   better ways of dealing with that.
[01:35:50.780 --> 01:35:54.260]   And I thought, well, our prognosis is not very good here.
[01:35:54.260 --> 01:35:56.660]   He left after about five sessions
[01:35:56.660 --> 01:35:58.660]   because it was just going to ask
[01:35:58.660 --> 01:36:01.180]   more than he was capable of.
[01:36:01.180 --> 01:36:02.920]   So there's a fear of the feminist,
[01:36:02.920 --> 01:36:05.860]   like I have to be so much in my masculine mode
[01:36:05.860 --> 01:36:08.300]   of combativeness or competitiveness
[01:36:08.300 --> 01:36:10.660]   or expression of competency.
[01:36:10.660 --> 01:36:14.140]   I can't afford anything that one would undo.
[01:36:14.140 --> 01:36:15.860]   My shaky hold on that.
[01:36:15.860 --> 01:36:18.900]   Wheresoever you see macho behavior,
[01:36:18.900 --> 01:36:21.260]   you see fear-based overcompensations,
[01:36:21.260 --> 01:36:23.580]   what it amounts to, right?
[01:36:23.580 --> 01:36:28.580]   You know, saber rattling is always a fear-based response.
[01:36:29.120 --> 01:36:32.320]   And underneath there is a very deep longing,
[01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:34.440]   you know, for the wise father,
[01:36:34.440 --> 01:36:39.000]   for the person you could see some modeling from,
[01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:40.480]   who would teach you something,
[01:36:40.480 --> 01:36:44.040]   who would share with you wisdom he's learned along the way.
[01:36:44.040 --> 01:36:47.080]   And so, you know, the condition of modern men
[01:36:47.080 --> 01:36:49.120]   and things have changed a great deal.
[01:36:49.120 --> 01:36:53.480]   And I think partly steered by the revolution
[01:36:53.480 --> 01:36:57.040]   in the history of women, you know,
[01:36:57.040 --> 01:37:01.640]   and their courage in addressing these stereotypes
[01:37:01.640 --> 01:37:02.760]   about what a woman is
[01:37:02.760 --> 01:37:04.960]   and what she's supposed to do with her life,
[01:37:04.960 --> 01:37:09.260]   required men to start looking at themselves as well.
[01:37:09.260 --> 01:37:11.380]   So women have done us a great favor,
[01:37:11.380 --> 01:37:13.960]   not always recognized by men.
[01:37:13.960 --> 01:37:16.480]   But, you know, in both cases,
[01:37:16.480 --> 01:37:17.580]   you have to say, all right,
[01:37:17.580 --> 01:37:21.040]   the message you have from family of origin and culture
[01:37:21.040 --> 01:37:22.800]   may or may not work for you,
[01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:26.080]   but you're here to, in a certain way,
[01:37:26.080 --> 01:37:29.760]   deconstruct, you know, those expectations
[01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:32.240]   and find your own path, you see.
[01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:36.240]   The Spanish analyst, Irene de Castillejo,
[01:37:36.240 --> 01:37:37.240]   long deceased now,
[01:37:37.240 --> 01:37:40.120]   talked about the difference between focused awareness
[01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:42.120]   and diffuse awareness.
[01:37:42.120 --> 01:37:45.000]   And I think rather than talk about gender,
[01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.760]   which is a social construct coming out of this culture
[01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:49.920]   or this culture or this culture,
[01:37:49.920 --> 01:37:52.520]   talk about those are two different modes
[01:37:52.520 --> 01:37:54.360]   of orientation to the world.
[01:37:54.360 --> 01:37:55.840]   And we need both.
[01:37:55.840 --> 01:37:59.240]   We need focused awareness that's goal-directed behavior
[01:37:59.240 --> 01:38:02.560]   that is historically associated with the masculine.
[01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:05.520]   And we also need this awareness of context
[01:38:05.520 --> 01:38:07.720]   and of relationship.
[01:38:07.720 --> 01:38:10.800]   So this focused awareness without relatedness
[01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:13.240]   leads to sterility and isolation.
[01:38:13.240 --> 01:38:14.560]   And on the other hand,
[01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:16.960]   too diffuse without a sense of directed
[01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:18.960]   and purposeful behavior, you know,
[01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:20.780]   means that one is just sort of fumbling
[01:38:20.780 --> 01:38:22.360]   one's way through life too.
[01:38:22.360 --> 01:38:25.520]   I've always said to women in therapy, you know,
[01:38:25.520 --> 01:38:27.360]   to be a man is in a sense,
[01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:30.800]   your requirement is to know what you want and to do it.
[01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:32.120]   But you have to do that too.
[01:38:32.120 --> 01:38:33.560]   And what Jung called the animus,
[01:38:33.560 --> 01:38:35.960]   that is to say the so-called inner masculine
[01:38:35.960 --> 01:38:37.600]   or the inner focused awareness.
[01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:40.440]   And that goal-directed behavior
[01:38:40.440 --> 01:38:44.240]   is what moves your life forward in a purposeful way.
[01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:47.480]   But for men, it's about becoming aware of,
[01:38:47.480 --> 01:38:50.480]   again, context and relatedness.
[01:38:50.480 --> 01:38:53.400]   What happens if I have the biggest pile of sand
[01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:54.800]   at the end of my life?
[01:38:54.800 --> 01:38:57.880]   Well, you know, obviously you can't take it with you,
[01:38:57.880 --> 01:38:59.680]   but in the end, it's only sand.
[01:38:59.680 --> 01:39:01.640]   Money's only money.
[01:39:01.640 --> 01:39:03.040]   What was your life about?
[01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:04.200]   That's the question.
[01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:08.360]   Women have to ask that, men have to ask that.
[01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:11.800]   And sometimes the culture is supportive in that process.
[01:39:11.800 --> 01:39:13.760]   Sometimes it's opposed to that.
[01:39:13.760 --> 01:39:17.080]   And then that's when you have to engage in a fight.
[01:39:17.080 --> 01:39:20.900]   Men and women have a common summons here,
[01:39:20.900 --> 01:39:23.920]   and they can be very supportive of each other
[01:39:23.920 --> 01:39:27.640]   as well as, you know, celebrate their differences
[01:39:27.640 --> 01:39:29.640]   and recognize, you know,
[01:39:29.640 --> 01:39:32.880]   as men are beginning to recognize,
[01:39:32.880 --> 01:39:35.400]   if you don't address what's going on inside of you,
[01:39:35.400 --> 01:39:39.280]   you're gonna be simply a creature of adaptation
[01:39:39.280 --> 01:39:41.640]   and you're gonna lose your way sooner or later.
[01:39:41.640 --> 01:39:46.620]   When I came back from my training in Zurich in the '70s,
[01:39:46.620 --> 01:39:53.140]   I would say my practice was 90% women and 10% men.
[01:39:53.140 --> 01:39:55.280]   Today, it's the reverse, 90% men.
[01:39:55.280 --> 01:39:58.240]   I don't put out a shingle and say I see men or women,
[01:39:58.240 --> 01:39:59.080]   I see both.
[01:39:59.080 --> 01:40:03.120]   But I think, again, the change is in men now.
[01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:07.480]   They recognize they're lost in some way.
[01:40:07.480 --> 01:40:12.480]   The old masculine definitions are no longer applicable.
[01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:14.720]   You know, a lot of this happened
[01:40:14.720 --> 01:40:16.220]   with the Industrial Revolution,
[01:40:16.220 --> 01:40:18.880]   where fathers and sons worked together in the same trade.
[01:40:18.880 --> 01:40:21.080]   If you were a tanner, you tanned.
[01:40:21.080 --> 01:40:24.420]   You know, if you were a carpenter, you built houses.
[01:40:24.420 --> 01:40:27.240]   If you were a shepherd, you, you know,
[01:40:27.240 --> 01:40:29.300]   worked with the sheep and so forth.
[01:40:29.300 --> 01:40:32.260]   And you sort of learn who you are
[01:40:32.260 --> 01:40:34.300]   from your rubbing shoulders with the father.
[01:40:34.300 --> 01:40:36.900]   Well, today, men go away to the factory
[01:40:36.900 --> 01:40:38.260]   or go away to the office,
[01:40:38.260 --> 01:40:41.340]   and sons are at home with their mothers, you know,
[01:40:41.340 --> 01:40:44.180]   and their female school teachers and so forth.
[01:40:44.180 --> 01:40:47.140]   And so there's, again, this deep hunger
[01:40:47.140 --> 01:40:52.140]   for the initiatory father, the supportive father.
[01:40:52.140 --> 01:40:56.440]   In traditional cultures where there were rites of passage,
[01:40:56.440 --> 01:41:01.000]   they recognize the importance of separating the boy
[01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:04.420]   at puberty, in a simpler culture, yes, but at puberty,
[01:41:04.420 --> 01:41:08.920]   it wasn't initiated by the personal father or relatives.
[01:41:08.920 --> 01:41:11.720]   It was by the elders in the tribe,
[01:41:11.720 --> 01:41:13.880]   often wearing masks or painted faces
[01:41:13.880 --> 01:41:15.920]   because they were archetypal forces.
[01:41:15.920 --> 01:41:17.620]   They were not the neighbor down the street.
[01:41:17.620 --> 01:41:20.720]   It was like, you're in the hands of the gods now,
[01:41:20.720 --> 01:41:23.320]   and they require you to leave home,
[01:41:23.320 --> 01:41:24.840]   and we're gonna teach you things,
[01:41:24.840 --> 01:41:28.120]   but we're also going to bring about some forms
[01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:30.000]   of isolation and suffering for you.
[01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.180]   So begin to realize that you have within you
[01:41:32.180 --> 01:41:34.920]   the resources to undertake this journey.
[01:41:34.920 --> 01:41:39.000]   What we have now is a whole culture of uninitiated males
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:42.440]   who haven't left home, psychologically speaking.
[01:41:42.440 --> 01:41:43.520]   You know, in the past,
[01:41:43.520 --> 01:41:45.840]   they were simply governed by masculine roles,
[01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:48.720]   and now, as those have dissolved for many men,
[01:41:48.720 --> 01:41:51.560]   there's very little sense of,
[01:41:51.560 --> 01:41:53.280]   well, what does it mean to be a man?
[01:41:53.280 --> 01:41:56.360]   What am I supposed to do as a man?
[01:41:56.360 --> 01:41:59.760]   And the answer, basically, is go live your life.
[01:41:59.760 --> 01:42:02.840]   Find your path, find the courage and resolve
[01:42:02.840 --> 01:42:06.400]   and resources to sustain that over time,
[01:42:06.400 --> 01:42:10.640]   but how to do that is, there's no model for that.
[01:42:10.640 --> 01:42:14.320]   You have to sort of find that yourself, you see,
[01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:17.240]   and that's what brings people into therapy at times,
[01:42:17.240 --> 01:42:19.360]   and it's interesting that I have, right now,
[01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:20.780]   this collection, and it's consonant
[01:42:20.780 --> 01:42:22.880]   with my own stage of life journey, too,
[01:42:22.880 --> 01:42:26.740]   I only have one man under 50,
[01:42:26.740 --> 01:42:29.760]   and all of the others are interested
[01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:32.880]   in how you deal with aging and mortality, for good reason,
[01:42:32.880 --> 01:42:34.180]   and they're also dealing with,
[01:42:34.180 --> 01:42:36.780]   how do I define myself other than my work?
[01:42:36.780 --> 01:42:42.760]   And that's where the unlived life often is coming back
[01:42:42.900 --> 01:42:45.900]   in a very useful way, all right?
[01:42:45.900 --> 01:42:48.020]   Although there are some things that have left
[01:42:48.020 --> 01:42:51.140]   and not coming back, in terms of the changes in the body
[01:42:51.140 --> 01:42:53.740]   and that sort of thing, but basically,
[01:42:53.740 --> 01:42:56.880]   now's the time to address this emotional,
[01:42:56.880 --> 01:42:59.960]   developmental, spiritual life.
[01:42:59.960 --> 01:43:02.700]   That is to say, do you have any concept of a story
[01:43:02.700 --> 01:43:06.940]   that's larger than the stories of your complexes, you see?
[01:43:06.940 --> 01:43:09.500]   Doesn't mean one has to be part of a religious group.
[01:43:09.500 --> 01:43:11.300]   It means that you have to question,
[01:43:11.300 --> 01:43:13.820]   what quickens the spirit in me?
[01:43:13.820 --> 01:43:15.460]   What stirs me inside?
[01:43:15.460 --> 01:43:17.460]   What touches me?
[01:43:17.460 --> 01:43:19.540]   Where do I encounter the numinous?
[01:43:19.540 --> 01:43:22.120]   And the word numinous means there's something there
[01:43:22.120 --> 01:43:25.620]   that causes this reaction within me.
[01:43:25.620 --> 01:43:29.300]   So if you and I walk into an art museum, let's say,
[01:43:29.300 --> 01:43:31.500]   and you're touched by a particular painting,
[01:43:31.500 --> 01:43:34.220]   and frightened by it, or moved to tears by it,
[01:43:34.220 --> 01:43:36.340]   or whatever, and the other person walks by
[01:43:36.340 --> 01:43:38.140]   and is indifferent, which is a right?
[01:43:38.140 --> 01:43:40.060]   Well, it's not right or wrong.
[01:43:40.060 --> 01:43:45.060]   It's this here, it correlates with something in here.
[01:43:45.060 --> 01:43:47.100]   That's what caused that resonance,
[01:43:47.100 --> 01:43:49.300]   and that resonance is your engagement
[01:43:49.300 --> 01:43:51.560]   with something numinous for you.
[01:43:51.560 --> 01:43:54.620]   You don't have to know it, or explain it, or whatever,
[01:43:54.620 --> 01:43:56.900]   but you have to value it, and ask,
[01:43:56.900 --> 01:43:58.860]   what is it that was touched in me?
[01:43:58.860 --> 01:44:01.000]   And if it doesn't speak to me,
[01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:04.700]   duty, or convention, or expectation
[01:44:04.700 --> 01:44:07.300]   is insufficient to make it happen.
[01:44:07.300 --> 01:44:10.700]   We can't will these things to be numinous.
[01:44:10.700 --> 01:44:14.820]   Numinosity is something that's defined by one's soul,
[01:44:14.820 --> 01:44:17.620]   and not by the collective, that's for sure.
[01:44:17.620 --> 01:44:19.800]   And women and men in time, I think,
[01:44:19.800 --> 01:44:24.060]   will find that they have very similar goals in their life,
[01:44:24.060 --> 01:44:26.980]   and that's how to balance my journey
[01:44:26.980 --> 01:44:29.780]   with the legitimate commitments of relationship
[01:44:29.780 --> 01:44:30.940]   on the other side.
[01:44:30.940 --> 01:44:35.940]   And that's why we have that wonderful word sacrifice.
[01:44:36.020 --> 01:44:41.020]   Not surrender, sacrifice is sacrifice to make sacred.
[01:44:41.020 --> 01:44:45.480]   If you're sacrificing on behalf of a value
[01:44:45.480 --> 01:44:49.580]   that is right for you, and for your project together,
[01:44:49.580 --> 01:44:52.260]   then you're both served by that.
[01:44:52.260 --> 01:44:55.300]   On the other hand, you don't sacrifice the journey
[01:44:55.300 --> 01:44:58.600]   of the individual spirit, too.
[01:44:58.600 --> 01:45:02.420]   And again, it's about balancing that as best one can,
[01:45:02.420 --> 01:45:05.820]   and there's very little in our culture that rewards that,
[01:45:05.820 --> 01:45:08.640]   but then the price is, again, the symptomatology
[01:45:08.640 --> 01:45:10.500]   that comes to the surface.
[01:45:10.500 --> 01:45:13.140]   And from a psychodynamic standpoint, we don't say,
[01:45:13.140 --> 01:45:15.120]   well, how quickly you'll get rid of the symptoms.
[01:45:15.120 --> 01:45:16.800]   We say, why if they come?
[01:45:16.800 --> 01:45:20.100]   What are they asking of me?
[01:45:20.100 --> 01:45:23.400]   That's why, as I said, my first question in therapy
[01:45:23.400 --> 01:45:25.460]   was how quickly did I get rid of this depression,
[01:45:25.460 --> 01:45:29.460]   get back on the road, you know, the careerism road, right?
[01:45:29.460 --> 01:45:33.740]   And I came in time to realize it was my psyche saying,
[01:45:33.740 --> 01:45:36.300]   you're on the wrong path, fella.
[01:45:36.300 --> 01:45:38.780]   You don't know, it's not so much that it's wrong,
[01:45:38.780 --> 01:45:40.100]   it's just not right for you.
[01:45:40.100 --> 01:45:42.100]   There's a big difference here,
[01:45:42.100 --> 01:45:43.940]   and you're gonna have to find a different kind
[01:45:43.940 --> 01:45:46.580]   of conversation in your life, and so forth.
[01:45:46.580 --> 01:45:49.340]   And during my training, I was obliged to, you know,
[01:45:49.340 --> 01:45:51.700]   do my clinical experience.
[01:45:51.700 --> 01:45:54.820]   I was working in a psychiatric hospital in New Jersey,
[01:45:54.820 --> 01:45:59.140]   and sometimes I was shuttling back and forth the same day
[01:45:59.140 --> 01:46:02.260]   between the psychiatric hospital, a locked ward
[01:46:02.260 --> 01:46:06.980]   and the university campus, and I came to realize
[01:46:06.980 --> 01:46:10.580]   the conversation in the hospital was more real somehow,
[01:46:10.580 --> 01:46:12.960]   it was more about things that mattered.
[01:46:12.960 --> 01:46:18.500]   And that's what began to, you know, further my resolve
[01:46:18.500 --> 01:46:22.660]   to move from academia to being a therapist,
[01:46:22.660 --> 01:46:25.060]   you know, a working therapist, and so forth.
[01:46:25.060 --> 01:46:29.580]   So, the point is, I need to add this,
[01:46:29.580 --> 01:46:34.580]   my way of responding to the family of origin
[01:46:34.580 --> 01:46:38.700]   and social context stuff was to retreat
[01:46:38.700 --> 01:46:40.620]   into the life of the mind.
[01:46:40.620 --> 01:46:43.220]   I didn't realize that's what I was doing at the time.
[01:46:43.220 --> 01:46:47.060]   That's why the psyche had to reach up and pull me under.
[01:46:47.060 --> 01:46:52.980]   And then I came to realize that the fears that I had
[01:46:52.980 --> 01:46:56.260]   in childhood were the ones I had to face at midlife,
[01:46:56.260 --> 01:47:00.580]   the difference being I was bringing the adult's capacity
[01:47:00.580 --> 01:47:03.540]   to the table that was not present to the child.
[01:47:03.540 --> 01:47:08.540]   So, quick example, in my first week working
[01:47:08.540 --> 01:47:10.260]   in the psychiatric hospital, I was signed
[01:47:10.260 --> 01:47:12.740]   to a kind of grizzled old ex-military guy
[01:47:12.740 --> 01:47:16.460]   who was my mentor, and without asking me,
[01:47:16.460 --> 01:47:18.060]   he took me into an autopsy.
[01:47:18.060 --> 01:47:20.740]   It was his, you know, let's initiate the new kid
[01:47:20.740 --> 01:47:22.340]   kind of thing, you know.
[01:47:22.340 --> 01:47:25.420]   Well, I realized it was a test, so I stayed cool
[01:47:25.420 --> 01:47:28.180]   and so forth, all the while I'm seeing this human body,
[01:47:28.180 --> 01:47:31.140]   you know, cut up and so forth in a radical way.
[01:47:31.140 --> 01:47:36.100]   And I realized all that I had fled in childhood
[01:47:36.100 --> 01:47:39.420]   was right there on the table before me.
[01:47:39.420 --> 01:47:43.100]   And it continued to perseverate in my dreams and so forth.
[01:47:43.100 --> 01:47:46.820]   And I was back in Zurich in my own analysis
[01:47:46.820 --> 01:47:50.140]   and I talked about this and my analyst said quite rightly,
[01:47:50.140 --> 01:47:51.900]   he said, "When you've dealt with your fears,
[01:47:51.900 --> 01:47:55.400]   "the fears of others will not be so threatening to you."
[01:47:55.400 --> 01:47:58.740]   'Cause the closed ward I was in was at times violent
[01:47:58.740 --> 01:48:01.780]   and so forth, and was not a pleasant situation,
[01:48:01.780 --> 01:48:06.300]   but I could feel my own sense of purpose and gravitas
[01:48:06.300 --> 01:48:08.380]   in that situation after that.
[01:48:08.380 --> 01:48:10.620]   So, it's like, you can run, but you can't hide.
[01:48:10.620 --> 01:48:13.860]   Sooner or later, what you've avoided will show up
[01:48:13.860 --> 01:48:17.380]   in your behaviors or your blockage in your behaviors.
[01:48:17.380 --> 01:48:19.560]   So, it doesn't go away, it goes somewhere.
[01:48:19.560 --> 01:48:23.260]   - I'd like to just hover a bit on this idea
[01:48:23.260 --> 01:48:28.260]   that on the one hand, our work is to understand ourselves
[01:48:28.260 --> 01:48:30.980]   and what really feeds our soul,
[01:48:30.980 --> 01:48:35.740]   and to try and live that forward as much as possible
[01:48:35.740 --> 01:48:38.500]   in a benevolent way, one would hope.
[01:48:38.500 --> 01:48:40.520]   And on the other hand,
[01:48:40.520 --> 01:48:45.400]   anytime we are in the relational aspects of life,
[01:48:45.400 --> 01:48:47.560]   in particular, romantic relationship
[01:48:47.560 --> 01:48:49.580]   as we sort of framed it here,
[01:48:50.820 --> 01:48:54.700]   because I think with friendships and work relationships,
[01:48:54.700 --> 01:48:57.540]   oftentimes it can align with the self in a different way.
[01:48:57.540 --> 01:49:04.100]   And it's our work to try and, as you said, sacrifice,
[01:49:04.100 --> 01:49:07.460]   to sacrifice one for the other, one for the other,
[01:49:07.460 --> 01:49:09.500]   in a way that over time allows both
[01:49:09.500 --> 01:49:12.300]   to not just persist, but grow.
[01:49:12.300 --> 01:49:15.020]   And I'm also thinking about what you said earlier,
[01:49:15.020 --> 01:49:17.060]   which was, we should be cautious
[01:49:17.060 --> 01:49:20.240]   about immediately applauding the 50-year marriage,
[01:49:20.240 --> 01:49:22.660]   because oftentimes there's a soul death
[01:49:22.660 --> 01:49:24.600]   in one or both people,
[01:49:24.600 --> 01:49:28.060]   and that we don't want to celebrate that.
[01:49:28.060 --> 01:49:29.940]   And yet, there's something pretty impressive
[01:49:29.940 --> 01:49:33.900]   about a 50-year marriage as, if for no other reason,
[01:49:33.900 --> 01:49:35.700]   as an endurance event.
[01:49:35.700 --> 01:49:37.100]   But we have to be cautious
[01:49:37.100 --> 01:49:39.180]   about rewarding endurance events like that,
[01:49:39.180 --> 01:49:42.180]   because in as much as they sound to be about love,
[01:49:42.180 --> 01:49:43.900]   I mean, there's also the endurance event
[01:49:43.900 --> 01:49:46.580]   of the person that was a stockbroker for 50 years
[01:49:46.580 --> 01:49:48.240]   and got to the end and then walked out
[01:49:48.240 --> 01:49:50.820]   of the stock exchange or stepped out
[01:49:50.820 --> 01:49:53.260]   from behind the computer monitor and went,
[01:49:53.260 --> 01:49:56.320]   "Oh, wow, I missed a lot."
[01:49:56.320 --> 01:49:57.160]   - That's right.
[01:49:57.160 --> 01:50:02.160]   - So, there's no handbook for this,
[01:50:02.160 --> 01:50:05.140]   of you spent 15 minutes here and 30 minutes there,
[01:50:05.140 --> 01:50:08.260]   ratio of two to one, children absorb energy,
[01:50:08.260 --> 01:50:12.480]   and when their health or other issues in a relationship,
[01:50:12.480 --> 01:50:17.140]   then energy goes as well.
[01:50:18.180 --> 01:50:23.180]   So, how does one guide the rudder?
[01:50:23.180 --> 01:50:28.640]   I mean, does it require third-party support?
[01:50:28.640 --> 01:50:30.780]   I mean, I've often thought this,
[01:50:30.780 --> 01:50:33.140]   because we evolved presumably in small villages
[01:50:33.140 --> 01:50:35.820]   where there was support at closer proximity
[01:50:35.820 --> 01:50:37.280]   than perhaps we have now,
[01:50:37.280 --> 01:50:40.180]   people that know both individuals
[01:50:40.180 --> 01:50:45.180]   and have the best in mind for both and for the collective.
[01:50:47.440 --> 01:50:52.440]   I mean, is there the idea that like every romantic couple
[01:50:52.440 --> 01:50:56.780]   should have a third-party trained counselor to guide them?
[01:50:56.780 --> 01:50:58.240]   Seems like not a bad idea,
[01:50:58.240 --> 01:51:00.140]   although I think people are pretty resistant to that.
[01:51:00.140 --> 01:51:03.080]   And of course it takes resources, which is always an issue.
[01:51:03.080 --> 01:51:04.000]   - Sure, sure.
[01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:05.160]   Well, there's nothing wrong
[01:51:05.160 --> 01:51:07.160]   with having the third-party conversation
[01:51:07.160 --> 01:51:08.720]   from time to time, that's for sure.
[01:51:08.720 --> 01:51:11.640]   We have to remember that what we call therapy
[01:51:11.640 --> 01:51:14.040]   is a relatively modern invention.
[01:51:14.040 --> 01:51:15.480]   How was that addressed before?
[01:51:15.480 --> 01:51:18.120]   You're right, at the village level.
[01:51:18.120 --> 01:51:23.120]   When people were living in vitalized mythological systems,
[01:51:23.120 --> 01:51:27.540]   they had a sense of relatedness to the cosmos,
[01:51:27.540 --> 01:51:30.240]   first of all, who are the gods?
[01:51:30.240 --> 01:51:32.600]   Wither do we go when we die?
[01:51:32.600 --> 01:51:33.860]   What's this life about?
[01:51:33.860 --> 01:51:36.920]   In other words, every tribe had its story.
[01:51:36.920 --> 01:51:40.480]   Secondly, what is our relationship to nature
[01:51:40.480 --> 01:51:42.680]   and to live in harmony with that nature
[01:51:42.720 --> 01:51:47.240]   as opposed to violating it repeatedly for our own purposes?
[01:51:47.240 --> 01:51:50.840]   Thirdly, to whom do I belong?
[01:51:50.840 --> 01:51:52.000]   Who is my tribe?
[01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:53.720]   Who are my people?
[01:51:53.720 --> 01:51:58.120]   And is that a life-serving or life-suppressing experience?
[01:51:58.120 --> 01:52:01.140]   And fourthly, is the mystery of individual journey.
[01:52:01.140 --> 01:52:04.680]   By what lights do I conduct my journey and so forth?
[01:52:04.680 --> 01:52:07.160]   And of course, those mythological systems
[01:52:07.160 --> 01:52:08.680]   were not particularly interested
[01:52:08.680 --> 01:52:10.320]   in the development of the individual,
[01:52:10.320 --> 01:52:12.240]   but they're certainly about the individual
[01:52:12.240 --> 01:52:15.280]   being subsumed into the tribal experience.
[01:52:15.280 --> 01:52:17.280]   At least you have a sense of belonging.
[01:52:17.280 --> 01:52:21.960]   Erode that, and people fall out of that
[01:52:21.960 --> 01:52:24.500]   into the abyss of the self, as it were.
[01:52:24.500 --> 01:52:27.320]   Jung put it this way.
[01:52:27.320 --> 01:52:31.280]   He said people walked off the medieval cathedral
[01:52:31.280 --> 01:52:35.280]   into the abyss of the self in one of his letters, you see.
[01:52:35.280 --> 01:52:39.280]   And it became a cultural contrivance
[01:52:39.280 --> 01:52:44.200]   with the best of intention to help people find their path
[01:52:44.200 --> 01:52:47.720]   and deal with whatever their psyche's reaction to,
[01:52:47.720 --> 01:52:50.220]   you know, again, typically, not always,
[01:52:50.220 --> 01:52:52.600]   but typically what brings people to therapy
[01:52:52.600 --> 01:52:57.280]   is that their belief system or their conventional practices
[01:52:57.280 --> 01:52:59.520]   are no longer working for them.
[01:52:59.520 --> 01:53:04.080]   I had a client from Houston once who said in his AA group,
[01:53:04.080 --> 01:53:06.400]   their slogan was, "This isn't working for me,
[01:53:06.400 --> 01:53:08.120]   "but I do it very well."
[01:53:08.120 --> 01:53:10.800]   That pretty much summarizes the first step
[01:53:10.800 --> 01:53:13.600]   of going into 12-step is that recognition.
[01:53:13.600 --> 01:53:14.440]   - That's right.
[01:53:14.440 --> 01:53:15.760]   - And then, you know, 12-step, of course,
[01:53:15.760 --> 01:53:16.880]   provides so much more.
[01:53:16.880 --> 01:53:18.960]   - But applicable to all of us, you know,
[01:53:18.960 --> 01:53:21.960]   our practices sooner or later will often,
[01:53:21.960 --> 01:53:24.320]   'cause they're driven by these stories
[01:53:24.320 --> 01:53:28.040]   that we carry intrapsychically, they don't work for us,
[01:53:28.040 --> 01:53:29.120]   but we've learned to do them
[01:53:29.120 --> 01:53:31.000]   with a certain facility and so forth.
[01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.920]   And that's when the discrepancy becomes so difficult,
[01:53:33.920 --> 01:53:38.840]   then one has to face the, you know, the fire, so to speak.
[01:53:38.840 --> 01:53:41.840]   Then what matters is how am I to conduct my life
[01:53:41.840 --> 01:53:43.960]   in the face of these circumstances,
[01:53:43.960 --> 01:53:46.720]   which I'm not able to solve in the old way,
[01:53:46.720 --> 01:53:50.840]   and that's the adventure, and that's the challenge,
[01:53:50.840 --> 01:53:53.160]   and at the same time, it's intimidating
[01:53:53.160 --> 01:53:56.360]   to many people, understandably.
[01:53:56.360 --> 01:53:59.920]   So sooner or later, again, one has to say,
[01:53:59.920 --> 01:54:04.080]   is this your life, or is it someone else's?
[01:54:04.080 --> 01:54:06.440]   Most people are not living their life, sadly.
[01:54:06.440 --> 01:54:07.880]   They're living reactively.
[01:54:07.880 --> 01:54:10.320]   They're living whatever the stories were,
[01:54:10.320 --> 01:54:12.720]   and I put stories not in the sense
[01:54:12.720 --> 01:54:15.320]   that they're so conscious as such,
[01:54:15.320 --> 01:54:20.320]   as they are representing whatever message we internalized
[01:54:20.320 --> 01:54:24.440]   and produced a splinter narrative.
[01:54:24.440 --> 01:54:26.640]   Again, when triggered, it has the power
[01:54:26.640 --> 01:54:28.800]   to govern our behaviors.
[01:54:28.800 --> 01:54:31.480]   That's why, again, you start with your own patterns
[01:54:31.480 --> 01:54:32.960]   and say, where did this come from?
[01:54:32.960 --> 01:54:34.920]   I wasn't born with it.
[01:54:34.920 --> 01:54:37.840]   A pattern is something that is replicating itself
[01:54:37.840 --> 01:54:41.760]   as a result of this story spilling into the world.
[01:54:41.760 --> 01:54:44.800]   So, you know, what I learned in my own life
[01:54:44.800 --> 01:54:49.720]   was I had put so much of my emotional distress
[01:54:49.720 --> 01:54:51.880]   up in the world of the life of the mind,
[01:54:51.880 --> 01:54:53.160]   which was rich and valuable.
[01:54:53.160 --> 01:54:56.360]   I don't repudiate that, but it was too one-sided,
[01:54:56.360 --> 01:54:58.360]   and what I had to do was come back
[01:54:58.360 --> 01:55:00.400]   and face what was on the operating table
[01:55:00.400 --> 01:55:02.680]   in that psychiatric hospital.
[01:55:02.680 --> 01:55:06.200]   The world of repressed emotion, fears, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:55:06.200 --> 01:55:08.400]   It's like both are true.
[01:55:08.400 --> 01:55:11.320]   Now, see if you can honor both of them,
[01:55:11.320 --> 01:55:14.320]   and when you do, something grows and develops within you
[01:55:14.320 --> 01:55:16.300]   to respond to that in a new way.
[01:55:16.300 --> 01:55:20.160]   - So we've been covering a lot of human universals
[01:55:20.160 --> 01:55:24.540]   and things that everybody should think about and address.
[01:55:24.540 --> 01:55:28.460]   We talked a bit about things more or less specific to men.
[01:55:28.460 --> 01:55:31.160]   What about women?
[01:55:31.160 --> 01:55:36.160]   What are some of the unique psychic challenges
[01:55:36.160 --> 01:55:42.000]   that they face and need to address in specific ways?
[01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:42.960]   - Sure.
[01:55:42.960 --> 01:55:47.300]   Well, first of all, each woman has to examine
[01:55:47.300 --> 01:55:50.440]   what was the message given her by her family,
[01:55:50.440 --> 01:55:54.740]   by her mother, her extended family expectations
[01:55:54.740 --> 01:55:58.260]   and role models, and cultural setting and so forth,
[01:55:58.260 --> 01:56:01.060]   and say, "Is this something that supports
[01:56:01.060 --> 01:56:03.460]   "my personal growth and development or not?"
[01:56:03.460 --> 01:56:05.220]   I mean, that's a kind of inventory.
[01:56:05.220 --> 01:56:07.420]   Men have to ask that same question as well.
[01:56:07.420 --> 01:56:13.300]   We have to acknowledge that biological differences suggest
[01:56:13.300 --> 01:56:15.020]   if you're a woman, you're the one
[01:56:15.020 --> 01:56:17.380]   who's gonna be carrying that baby,
[01:56:17.380 --> 01:56:20.680]   and still in our culture, the major responsibility for it,
[01:56:20.680 --> 01:56:25.160]   while shared by father and mother, hopefully,
[01:56:25.160 --> 01:56:28.280]   still is something you have to attend.
[01:56:28.280 --> 01:56:32.640]   And many women are trying to have it both ways, as we know,
[01:56:32.640 --> 01:56:37.640]   the career development and being a parent at the same time.
[01:56:37.640 --> 01:56:40.080]   I saw a survey some years ago
[01:56:40.080 --> 01:56:44.280]   that a large number of women executives,
[01:56:44.280 --> 01:56:47.820]   all had MBAs and had all achieved, you know,
[01:56:47.820 --> 01:56:51.740]   like vice president status or something in their corporation.
[01:56:51.740 --> 01:56:55.720]   When asked around age 50, "Would you do this all again?"
[01:56:55.720 --> 01:56:59.220]   Almost 100% said no.
[01:56:59.220 --> 01:57:01.500]   It cost too much for me.
[01:57:01.500 --> 01:57:03.840]   It cost me too much.
[01:57:03.840 --> 01:57:05.620]   They felt something else was missing.
[01:57:05.620 --> 01:57:07.580]   They felt friendship was missing.
[01:57:07.580 --> 01:57:10.140]   They felt intimacy was missing.
[01:57:10.140 --> 01:57:12.580]   In many cases, they felt parenting was missing,
[01:57:12.580 --> 01:57:15.060]   or it had gotten short shrift, you see.
[01:57:15.060 --> 01:57:19.540]   As men often face when they look at retirement,
[01:57:19.540 --> 01:57:22.060]   you know, as the old saying, on your deathbed,
[01:57:22.060 --> 01:57:23.660]   you don't say, "Gee, I wish I spent more time
[01:57:23.660 --> 01:57:24.820]   "at the office," you know?
[01:57:24.820 --> 01:57:26.900]   It's like, "I wish I'd done this or that."
[01:57:26.900 --> 01:57:29.460]   - I know a few scientists who, to this day,
[01:57:29.460 --> 01:57:31.540]   say that they plan to die in their office.
[01:57:31.540 --> 01:57:33.860]   It's always a sad thing for me to hear this.
[01:57:33.860 --> 01:57:35.860]   I also know their children, in many cases,
[01:57:35.860 --> 01:57:40.860]   and that's about 4/5 of the time is not a good picture.
[01:57:40.860 --> 01:57:41.940]   - That's right.
[01:57:41.940 --> 01:57:45.820]   - Yeah, and again, not all, right, this 4/5,
[01:57:45.820 --> 01:57:48.900]   but because other colleagues are spectacular parents,
[01:57:48.900 --> 01:57:51.380]   but I grew up with the children of a lot of academics,
[01:57:51.380 --> 01:57:54.820]   and a lot of times, it ain't a pretty picture.
[01:57:54.820 --> 01:57:55.820]   - That's right.
[01:57:55.820 --> 01:58:00.820]   So I think that another thing that men, in our time,
[01:58:00.820 --> 01:58:06.180]   really need to learn is, if you're in a relationship,
[01:58:06.180 --> 01:58:08.260]   part of your role is supporting the growth
[01:58:08.260 --> 01:58:09.980]   and development of your partner,
[01:58:10.220 --> 01:58:11.620]   and the more insecure the man,
[01:58:11.620 --> 01:58:13.540]   the more threatened he will be by that,
[01:58:13.540 --> 01:58:16.660]   because she might go off in some other direction, you see.
[01:58:16.660 --> 01:58:20.380]   And that means sharing household duties
[01:58:20.380 --> 01:58:22.560]   and sharing childcare and so forth,
[01:58:22.560 --> 01:58:25.100]   which you do to the best of your ability.
[01:58:25.100 --> 01:58:27.060]   Having a child and having two careers
[01:58:27.060 --> 01:58:31.380]   requires an enormous amount of juggling, as we all know,
[01:58:31.380 --> 01:58:36.100]   but you can do it in good faith with the best of intentions.
[01:58:36.100 --> 01:58:39.740]   If not, resentment builds, and one-sidedness builds.
[01:58:39.740 --> 01:58:44.740]   So I think for women, they still need a partner
[01:58:44.740 --> 01:58:49.620]   that will buy into the notion of genuine reciprocity
[01:58:49.620 --> 01:58:54.220]   in our responsibility to each other and to our work together,
[01:58:54.220 --> 01:58:55.740]   which includes child-rearing,
[01:58:55.740 --> 01:59:00.740]   without which women are unduly burdened, you see,
[01:59:00.740 --> 01:59:02.460]   unfairly burdened,
[01:59:02.460 --> 01:59:04.940]   and I don't think we've solved that one yet.
[01:59:04.940 --> 01:59:06.620]   I think that's still open-ended
[01:59:06.620 --> 01:59:09.400]   in the culture at this point.
[01:59:09.400 --> 01:59:13.860]   On the other hand, it's stunning to see women grab hold
[01:59:13.860 --> 01:59:15.720]   of the opportunities available now.
[01:59:15.720 --> 01:59:19.860]   I'm living in a retirement community as of a year ago,
[01:59:19.860 --> 01:59:22.700]   and so many of the women that I've had dinner with,
[01:59:22.700 --> 01:59:25.460]   my wife and I have dinner with various people,
[01:59:25.460 --> 01:59:27.020]   have said, "Well, when I was at this stage,
[01:59:27.020 --> 01:59:29.420]   "women were not allowed to do this."
[01:59:29.420 --> 01:59:31.140]   One woman was a scientist, and she said,
[01:59:31.140 --> 01:59:34.260]   "I just wasn't recognized in the physics world
[01:59:34.260 --> 01:59:37.140]   "until, like, late in my life."
[01:59:37.140 --> 01:59:40.000]   And you forget how recently that was the case.
[01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:44.080]   I mean, that was a deep violation of the human spirit,
[01:59:44.080 --> 01:59:45.480]   but it was routine.
[01:59:45.480 --> 01:59:47.280]   And so many of the women that I see there
[01:59:47.280 --> 01:59:50.400]   who are gonna be over 70, most of them are over 80,
[01:59:50.400 --> 01:59:54.880]   lived in a world that was not unlike a segregated world,
[01:59:54.880 --> 01:59:58.920]   just as I grew up where segregation
[01:59:58.920 --> 02:00:01.760]   was practiced by half of this country.
[02:00:01.760 --> 02:00:03.680]   It's not so long ago.
[02:00:03.680 --> 02:00:05.480]   - Somewhat hard to fathom
[02:00:06.560 --> 02:00:08.240]   how much things have changed,
[02:00:08.240 --> 02:00:10.840]   and yet also how much things persist.
[02:00:10.840 --> 02:00:12.760]   - That's right, that's right.
[02:00:12.760 --> 02:00:15.120]   Well, and, you know, the '60s happened,
[02:00:15.120 --> 02:00:17.040]   and what happened to the '60s
[02:00:17.040 --> 02:00:22.040]   is a kind of resurgence from below
[02:00:22.040 --> 02:00:25.900]   in both men and women, some men and some women,
[02:00:25.900 --> 02:00:29.080]   to overthrow the sort of oppressive nature
[02:00:29.080 --> 02:00:31.160]   of role definitions and so forth.
[02:00:31.160 --> 02:00:35.400]   You know, I mean, you couldn't think of marrying a person
[02:00:35.400 --> 02:00:37.360]   in another religion, for example.
[02:00:37.360 --> 02:00:40.100]   You couldn't think of marrying someone of a different race.
[02:00:40.100 --> 02:00:43.200]   I mean, the price of that meant you had to go live
[02:00:43.200 --> 02:00:45.160]   anonymously in the city somewhere,
[02:00:45.160 --> 02:00:47.480]   or you couldn't be gay, for example.
[02:00:47.480 --> 02:00:51.420]   The love that dare not speak its name, as it was called.
[02:00:51.420 --> 02:00:56.360]   All of that's been radically challenged, and rightly so.
[02:00:56.360 --> 02:01:00.160]   And yet what that does is bring about a world
[02:01:00.160 --> 02:01:04.680]   of great freedom, greater freedom, but also ambiguity.
[02:01:04.680 --> 02:01:07.320]   You know, if this isn't right, well, but what's this,
[02:01:07.320 --> 02:01:08.600]   and what's that?
[02:01:08.600 --> 02:01:11.120]   And people are troubled by ambiguity.
[02:01:11.120 --> 02:01:15.080]   And so, therefore, there's always a reactive nature
[02:01:15.080 --> 02:01:19.240]   in some individuals who are fighting that, you see.
[02:01:19.240 --> 02:01:24.240]   So, again, it shows up in various issues of racism,
[02:01:24.240 --> 02:01:26.000]   whether we have abortion or not,
[02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:29.440]   or whatever the social issue may be.
[02:01:29.440 --> 02:01:31.660]   A lot of what's playing out there
[02:01:31.660 --> 02:01:34.460]   is the traditional role definitions
[02:01:34.460 --> 02:01:37.940]   versus a sense of the autonomy of the individual
[02:01:37.940 --> 02:01:40.680]   to live his or her journey, you see.
[02:01:40.680 --> 02:01:45.620]   - I'd like to shift a bit to discussions of pathology,
[02:01:45.620 --> 02:01:48.940]   or asserted pathology.
[02:01:48.940 --> 02:01:52.700]   Nowadays, I think thanks, again, to social media,
[02:01:52.700 --> 02:01:55.740]   or no thanks to social media,
[02:01:55.740 --> 02:02:00.220]   there's a lot of use of psychological terms.
[02:02:00.220 --> 02:02:05.220]   Narcissism, projection, gaslighting, clinical diagnoses.
[02:02:05.220 --> 02:02:11.860]   I mean, I admittedly took the liberty of saying
[02:02:11.860 --> 02:02:15.460]   that I, as a non-clinician, view the landscape
[02:02:15.460 --> 02:02:18.380]   of a lot of social media as borderline,
[02:02:18.380 --> 02:02:22.060]   and I have no credential to be able to diagnose
[02:02:22.060 --> 02:02:23.980]   an individual, let alone the internet.
[02:02:23.980 --> 02:02:28.620]   So, I'll be clear about my limitations whenever possible.
[02:02:28.620 --> 02:02:33.620]   But there are real pathologies of the psyche, of the mind.
[02:02:33.620 --> 02:02:37.920]   I'd be curious about your view of the ones
[02:02:37.920 --> 02:02:41.540]   that tend to capture people's attention the most.
[02:02:41.540 --> 02:02:44.660]   I mean, I think we now understand
[02:02:44.660 --> 02:02:46.860]   some of the neurochemical basis
[02:02:46.860 --> 02:02:50.820]   of certain psychiatric challenges,
[02:02:50.820 --> 02:02:54.100]   schizophrenia bipolar in particular, OCD in particular,
[02:02:54.100 --> 02:02:56.460]   sometimes by way of which medications
[02:02:56.460 --> 02:02:57.820]   they respond to or don't.
[02:02:58.820 --> 02:03:00.900]   But that alone doesn't allow us
[02:03:00.900 --> 02:03:03.220]   to understand their underlying mechanisms.
[02:03:03.220 --> 02:03:05.140]   I think a lot of that is still mysterious.
[02:03:05.140 --> 02:03:08.460]   But I'd love to get a different perspective
[02:03:08.460 --> 02:03:12.220]   on these things, which is the psychological perspective,
[02:03:12.220 --> 02:03:15.620]   which of course embraces biology,
[02:03:15.620 --> 02:03:17.440]   but looks at it a little bit differently.
[02:03:17.440 --> 02:03:21.240]   So, yeah, what are your thoughts about the way
[02:03:21.240 --> 02:03:25.580]   that these days these words are slung?
[02:03:25.580 --> 02:03:30.580]   And what's your view about our actual treatment
[02:03:30.580 --> 02:03:34.540]   for these conditions, both for the people suffering
[02:03:34.540 --> 02:03:36.980]   from them and the people that suffer
[02:03:36.980 --> 02:03:38.340]   because others suffer from them?
[02:03:38.340 --> 02:03:40.780]   - Yeah, well, you're asking me to speak both
[02:03:40.780 --> 02:03:43.300]   as a therapist and as a citizen, I think,
[02:03:43.300 --> 02:03:45.720]   and I'll address the first one first.
[02:03:45.720 --> 02:03:51.740]   Part of the therapist's role is to differential diagnosis.
[02:03:51.740 --> 02:03:55.860]   In other words, if a person comes in with a depression,
[02:03:55.860 --> 02:03:58.180]   we have to try to define what kind of depression
[02:03:58.180 --> 02:03:59.020]   we're talking about.
[02:03:59.020 --> 02:04:00.940]   There are different kinds of depression.
[02:04:00.940 --> 02:04:02.660]   Is this a reactive depression?
[02:04:02.660 --> 02:04:05.420]   It's only pathological if it lasts too long
[02:04:05.420 --> 02:04:09.540]   or interferes with their normal functioning too much,
[02:04:09.540 --> 02:04:11.360]   and that's a judgment call.
[02:04:11.360 --> 02:04:13.980]   If a person's grieving the loss of something important
[02:04:13.980 --> 02:04:16.560]   in their life, the loss of a marriage, let's say,
[02:04:16.560 --> 02:04:19.100]   it's appropriate to feel depressed
[02:04:19.100 --> 02:04:22.220]   for a certain length of time until life's challenges
[02:04:22.220 --> 02:04:24.820]   move on forward and so forth.
[02:04:24.820 --> 02:04:29.740]   There is biologically driven depression,
[02:04:29.740 --> 02:04:31.820]   which can be approached with medication,
[02:04:31.820 --> 02:04:34.540]   although many of the antidepressants are very limited
[02:04:34.540 --> 02:04:36.100]   in their success.
[02:04:36.100 --> 02:04:39.340]   Long-term therapy tends to be more effective
[02:04:39.340 --> 02:04:41.460]   as various studies have recognized,
[02:04:41.460 --> 02:04:44.780]   albeit there's an economic cost to that.
[02:04:44.780 --> 02:04:46.900]   And then thirdly, there's what you can call
[02:04:46.900 --> 02:04:50.660]   an intrapsychic depression, which is what I experienced,
[02:04:50.660 --> 02:04:54.180]   was that there were certain parts of my life
[02:04:54.180 --> 02:04:59.180]   that had been walled off, and that was crying out.
[02:04:59.180 --> 02:05:02.300]   Pathology comes from the Greek word pathos,
[02:05:02.300 --> 02:05:04.860]   which means suffering, and logos,
[02:05:04.860 --> 02:05:06.140]   which means expression of.
[02:05:06.140 --> 02:05:09.820]   So pathology means the expression of the suffering.
[02:05:09.820 --> 02:05:12.300]   Psychopathology is expression of the suffering of the soul.
[02:05:12.300 --> 02:05:16.380]   So what is it in terms of this person's natural desire
[02:05:16.380 --> 02:05:18.060]   to live in a meaningful way
[02:05:18.060 --> 02:05:19.500]   that's interfering with their life?
[02:05:19.500 --> 02:05:21.340]   Is it biologically driven?
[02:05:21.340 --> 02:05:24.500]   Is it a function of the social context in which they live,
[02:05:24.500 --> 02:05:28.820]   or is it some personal task that they have to address?
[02:05:28.820 --> 02:05:33.140]   And that kind of differential diagnosis is essential.
[02:05:33.140 --> 02:05:34.980]   And as you said, there are certain conditions
[02:05:34.980 --> 02:05:37.460]   that are predominantly biologically driven,
[02:05:37.460 --> 02:05:40.820]   such as schizophrenia, bipolar, et cetera.
[02:05:40.820 --> 02:05:44.300]   So secondly then, speaking as a citizen,
[02:05:46.020 --> 02:05:48.620]   you know, the internet,
[02:05:48.620 --> 02:05:50.540]   and I don't wanna get lost in the internet again,
[02:05:50.540 --> 02:05:53.180]   but it's like it's a vast open stage
[02:05:53.180 --> 02:05:55.780]   in which whatever is unaddressed in people
[02:05:55.780 --> 02:06:00.420]   can be put out there without censorship,
[02:06:00.420 --> 02:06:04.420]   without reflection, without the other being represented.
[02:06:04.420 --> 02:06:09.220]   And it allows people to reveal
[02:06:09.220 --> 02:06:14.220]   whatever is going on within them without genuine dialogue.
[02:06:15.300 --> 02:06:17.020]   And of course you can have opposition,
[02:06:17.020 --> 02:06:19.060]   but what has to happen typically is,
[02:06:19.060 --> 02:06:21.620]   again, associating with like-minded people.
[02:06:21.620 --> 02:06:25.220]   I must be right because these other people agree with me,
[02:06:25.220 --> 02:06:26.420]   you see.
[02:06:26.420 --> 02:06:30.340]   So, you know, any of these terms can be misappropriated
[02:06:30.340 --> 02:06:33.460]   and will be sooner or later.
[02:06:33.460 --> 02:06:37.500]   So what one has to say is we can only make diagnoses
[02:06:37.500 --> 02:06:40.260]   with, you know, observation over time.
[02:06:40.260 --> 02:06:44.860]   It's very hard initially to know what's really going on.
[02:06:44.860 --> 02:06:48.700]   As I mentioned, what we do or what someone does is logical.
[02:06:48.700 --> 02:06:50.820]   What we don't know is what it's in service to
[02:06:50.820 --> 02:06:52.420]   inside of them.
[02:06:52.420 --> 02:06:56.140]   And you will not get much sense of that by the internet
[02:06:56.140 --> 02:06:57.980]   because it's too superficial.
[02:06:57.980 --> 02:07:00.540]   That's why it takes repeated observation
[02:07:00.540 --> 02:07:03.280]   and conversation for that to emerge.
[02:07:03.280 --> 02:07:06.500]   - The reason I keep coming back to the internet
[02:07:06.500 --> 02:07:08.860]   is I think it's where most people get their information now.
[02:07:08.860 --> 02:07:11.940]   It's, unless they're listening to this as a podcast,
[02:07:11.940 --> 02:07:14.440]   that's where they're going to get this information.
[02:07:14.440 --> 02:07:19.440]   I think what you said about the lack of dialogue
[02:07:19.440 --> 02:07:22.200]   being really key.
[02:07:22.200 --> 02:07:24.680]   I mean, I think we see this now also at the level of media.
[02:07:24.680 --> 02:07:26.780]   We have a very polarized media.
[02:07:26.780 --> 02:07:28.040]   - Yes.
[02:07:28.040 --> 02:07:29.800]   - This is an independent media channel.
[02:07:29.800 --> 02:07:31.960]   We don't have a political stance
[02:07:31.960 --> 02:07:33.920]   despite what some people might assert.
[02:07:33.920 --> 02:07:34.760]   We don't, right?
[02:07:34.760 --> 02:07:37.320]   It's about science and health information
[02:07:37.320 --> 02:07:39.520]   for everyone who is interested.
[02:07:39.520 --> 02:07:42.440]   Zero cost, that's the mission.
[02:07:42.440 --> 02:07:43.280]   - Understood.
[02:07:43.280 --> 02:07:48.280]   - So when we read and see things now about politics,
[02:07:48.280 --> 02:07:52.500]   but also about business, about sport, about celebrity,
[02:07:52.500 --> 02:07:54.840]   about kids, about culture,
[02:07:54.840 --> 02:07:59.300]   all too often the labels of psychology are placed on those.
[02:07:59.300 --> 02:08:00.800]   Kids are depressed.
[02:08:00.800 --> 02:08:03.020]   They're not just lonely, they're depressed.
[02:08:03.020 --> 02:08:06.000]   And they may very well be experiencing high levels
[02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.240]   of clinical diagnosis of depression.
[02:08:08.240 --> 02:08:09.640]   That could be true.
[02:08:09.680 --> 02:08:13.440]   So my concern, it's a real concern,
[02:08:13.440 --> 02:08:15.040]   which is why I keep bringing this up,
[02:08:15.040 --> 02:08:17.760]   is that in doing that,
[02:08:17.760 --> 02:08:21.520]   that we both diminish the suffering of those
[02:08:21.520 --> 02:08:24.160]   who are really suffering from those pathologies.
[02:08:24.160 --> 02:08:29.160]   And we also perhaps create a little bit of catastrophizing
[02:08:29.160 --> 02:08:32.480]   about feeling low for an afternoon
[02:08:32.480 --> 02:08:35.960]   might be a great source of stimulus
[02:08:35.960 --> 02:08:40.960]   to go write or think or nap or insight.
[02:08:40.960 --> 02:08:47.680]   And I loathe to think that in people learning terms,
[02:08:47.680 --> 02:08:50.820]   that somehow they're getting further away
[02:08:50.820 --> 02:08:51.960]   from what they need.
[02:08:51.960 --> 02:08:53.000]   - No, I agree.
[02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:58.740]   Louis Pasteur, from whom we got pasteurization, of course,
[02:08:58.740 --> 02:09:03.440]   reportedly put over the entrance to his office.
[02:09:03.440 --> 02:09:05.560]   Tell me not your politics or your religion,
[02:09:05.560 --> 02:09:07.520]   tell me only your suffering.
[02:09:07.520 --> 02:09:10.780]   And I always think about that in the context of therapy
[02:09:10.780 --> 02:09:14.360]   because everybody's a suffering soul
[02:09:14.360 --> 02:09:17.000]   because life is difficult and then you die.
[02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:18.480]   So have a nice day, right?
[02:09:18.480 --> 02:09:20.920]   Life is suffering.
[02:09:20.920 --> 02:09:25.920]   And that's not pessimistic, that's just descriptive.
[02:09:25.920 --> 02:09:29.160]   The question is, what does that suffering make you do?
[02:09:29.160 --> 02:09:30.560]   What does it keep you from doing?
[02:09:30.560 --> 02:09:32.520]   That's the central question.
[02:09:32.520 --> 02:09:37.520]   There's where the person is called into some accountability.
[02:09:37.520 --> 02:09:39.600]   You know, if you're depressed, all right,
[02:09:39.600 --> 02:09:42.300]   what's the task that that depression's asking of you?
[02:09:42.300 --> 02:09:47.280]   If you're anxious, where's that anxiety coming from?
[02:09:47.280 --> 02:09:48.880]   How much of that is archaic?
[02:09:48.880 --> 02:09:51.600]   How much of that is inherited from family?
[02:09:51.600 --> 02:09:55.480]   How much of that is unique to your life?
[02:09:55.480 --> 02:09:58.440]   And what is the task that is to be addressed there?
[02:09:58.440 --> 02:10:00.880]   I also wrote a book called "Swamplands of the Soul"
[02:10:00.880 --> 02:10:03.120]   that deals with anxiety, depression, loss,
[02:10:03.120 --> 02:10:05.200]   betrayal, et cetera, et cetera.
[02:10:05.200 --> 02:10:09.080]   And sooner or later, life is going to take us to swamplands
[02:10:09.080 --> 02:10:13.120]   where you find yourself really mired into something
[02:10:13.120 --> 02:10:16.400]   and one will feel very much victimized in that way.
[02:10:16.400 --> 02:10:19.240]   But that's the passive experience.
[02:10:19.240 --> 02:10:21.960]   The summons is always what is the task
[02:10:21.960 --> 02:10:25.620]   that this visitation to the swampland is asking of you?
[02:10:25.620 --> 02:10:28.240]   What do you need to address?
[02:10:28.240 --> 02:10:30.560]   If you feel that your partner betrayed you
[02:10:30.560 --> 02:10:32.520]   and left the marriage, for example, all right,
[02:10:32.520 --> 02:10:34.600]   and took your self-esteem with that, all right,
[02:10:34.600 --> 02:10:37.740]   well, your task is the recovery of self-worth
[02:10:37.740 --> 02:10:40.040]   because without that, no other choice you make
[02:10:40.040 --> 02:10:41.400]   is gonna be very good.
[02:10:41.400 --> 02:10:44.680]   And maybe that's a hard project,
[02:10:44.680 --> 02:10:47.800]   but that's nonetheless the work you have to do.
[02:10:47.800 --> 02:10:51.600]   So always the question, what does this make you do?
[02:10:51.600 --> 02:10:53.240]   What does it keep you from doing?
[02:10:53.240 --> 02:10:58.160]   And to bring responsibility back to the individual.
[02:10:58.160 --> 02:10:59.560]   And of course, some people are willing
[02:10:59.560 --> 02:11:01.960]   to accept that responsibility, some are not.
[02:11:01.960 --> 02:11:03.000]   And that makes the difference.
[02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:06.400]   I had a colleague many moons ago who said
[02:11:06.400 --> 02:11:07.960]   she could tell in the first hour
[02:11:07.960 --> 02:11:10.280]   whether the person she was seeing was a big kid
[02:11:10.280 --> 02:11:14.480]   or a little kid because everybody's a recovering child.
[02:11:14.480 --> 02:11:16.920]   And the big kids could do the work.
[02:11:16.920 --> 02:11:20.080]   The little kids wanted someone to tell them what to do
[02:11:20.080 --> 02:11:23.080]   or tell them that there's an easy fix to this.
[02:11:23.080 --> 02:11:27.640]   And in the long run, those person's gonna stay stuck
[02:11:27.640 --> 02:11:30.840]   pretty much until something else happens
[02:11:30.840 --> 02:11:32.840]   in their life, perhaps.
[02:11:32.840 --> 02:11:35.120]   - Well, to me, it seems that the litmus test
[02:11:35.120 --> 02:11:38.040]   is the extent to which somebody is pointing fingers
[02:11:38.040 --> 02:11:42.440]   at others or directing the work towards themselves,
[02:11:42.440 --> 02:11:44.040]   regardless of who was wrong.
[02:11:44.040 --> 02:11:44.880]   - Sure, sure.
[02:11:44.880 --> 02:11:48.320]   - One individual, both individual, like regardless.
[02:11:48.320 --> 02:11:49.920]   Ultimately, I think what you're saying,
[02:11:49.920 --> 02:11:50.920]   and forgive me for interrupting,
[02:11:50.920 --> 02:11:53.720]   is that if one is asking what is the task
[02:11:53.720 --> 02:11:56.320]   to develop what, you know, to control one's anxiety,
[02:11:56.320 --> 02:11:58.480]   to develop stronger sense of self,
[02:11:58.480 --> 02:12:03.480]   to better understand what one really wants and assert that,
[02:12:03.480 --> 02:12:09.000]   to set better boundaries so that people's projections
[02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:12.040]   are not as permeable to us, whatever it is,
[02:12:12.040 --> 02:12:17.040]   ultimately, there's no business of looking at
[02:12:17.040 --> 02:12:20.560]   what others are doing wrong in that.
[02:12:20.560 --> 02:12:23.360]   It's all introspective and self-directed things.
[02:12:23.360 --> 02:12:24.540]   - That's right.
[02:12:24.560 --> 02:12:27.320]   Well, and you gave good examples of the kind of tasks
[02:12:27.320 --> 02:12:30.240]   that rise out of a person's experience.
[02:12:30.240 --> 02:12:32.880]   Now, for example, if a person has been subject
[02:12:32.880 --> 02:12:36.000]   to serious abuse in childhood, physical or emotional
[02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:40.920]   or sexual or whatever, it's affected their entire life.
[02:12:40.920 --> 02:12:42.800]   Well, what is the task?
[02:12:42.800 --> 02:12:47.040]   You know, it's to wrest from that experience
[02:12:47.040 --> 02:12:50.960]   a sense of self and that one is still here
[02:12:50.960 --> 02:12:52.360]   to live one's journey.
[02:12:52.360 --> 02:12:55.100]   That's why I said at the beginning of our conversation,
[02:12:55.100 --> 02:12:56.820]   I'm not what happened to me.
[02:12:56.820 --> 02:12:59.980]   I'm what is wanting to be expressed in my life through me.
[02:12:59.980 --> 02:13:04.420]   To get a person to that place takes some time
[02:13:04.420 --> 02:13:06.400]   and repetition, frankly.
[02:13:06.400 --> 02:13:08.380]   You know, the two hardest things I ever learned
[02:13:08.380 --> 02:13:10.960]   as a therapist, and I still don't like either one of them,
[02:13:10.960 --> 02:13:11.940]   is patience.
[02:13:11.940 --> 02:13:14.980]   You have to sit with it over time.
[02:13:14.980 --> 02:13:17.740]   You have to sort and sift and sort and sift
[02:13:17.740 --> 02:13:20.940]   and hold this over time till something else emerges.
[02:13:20.940 --> 02:13:23.180]   And secondly, powerlessness.
[02:13:23.180 --> 02:13:27.460]   I can't fix anybody, right?
[02:13:27.460 --> 02:13:30.640]   But we can try to promote the attitudes and behaviors
[02:13:30.640 --> 02:13:33.020]   that will allow that person to find what is right
[02:13:33.020 --> 02:13:34.460]   from within them.
[02:13:34.460 --> 02:13:37.260]   Because something in each of us always knows
[02:13:37.260 --> 02:13:39.380]   what is right for us.
[02:13:39.380 --> 02:13:42.960]   If we pay attention and if we are willing to honor
[02:13:42.960 --> 02:13:47.220]   what emerges and have enough courage to address that,
[02:13:47.220 --> 02:13:49.040]   then we can live in a different way.
[02:13:49.040 --> 02:13:54.040]   And it's very tough in the face of substantial abuse,
[02:13:54.040 --> 02:13:58.260]   for example, because it was so intrusive and so devastating.
[02:13:58.260 --> 02:14:00.520]   It's cleared out a space in which the self
[02:14:00.520 --> 02:14:02.760]   seems to find no room.
[02:14:02.760 --> 02:14:06.540]   But that's the task then, is the recovery of a sense of self
[02:14:06.540 --> 02:14:09.820]   and purpose that's independent of what happened to oneself.
[02:14:09.820 --> 02:14:13.920]   - It's almost as if one needs to really understand
[02:14:13.920 --> 02:14:18.760]   their own story, but then be able to depart from that story.
[02:14:18.760 --> 02:14:22.020]   - Yeah, that's why I said one has to have a larger story
[02:14:22.020 --> 02:14:24.580]   than what happened to you, right?
[02:14:24.580 --> 02:14:27.580]   One has to have a larger story than the story
[02:14:27.580 --> 02:14:29.380]   that one's culture gives you,
[02:14:29.380 --> 02:14:31.480]   or your family of origin gives you.
[02:14:31.480 --> 02:14:33.200]   What is that story?
[02:14:33.200 --> 02:14:36.820]   That's why I said my instructions and my models
[02:14:36.820 --> 02:14:39.980]   were to stay home and stay safe.
[02:14:39.980 --> 02:14:44.460]   Something in me hungered, and I honor my teachers
[02:14:44.460 --> 02:14:45.760]   to this day.
[02:14:45.760 --> 02:14:49.300]   I honor a local librarian who showed me any book.
[02:14:49.300 --> 02:14:51.740]   She recognized this kid's a reader.
[02:14:51.740 --> 02:14:54.340]   So she said to me, "You don't have to stay
[02:14:54.340 --> 02:14:55.180]   "in the children's section.
[02:14:55.180 --> 02:14:56.840]   "You can go anywhere you want in the library,"
[02:14:56.840 --> 02:14:59.240]   which I thought was like having a lot of candy.
[02:14:59.240 --> 02:15:00.520]   I enjoyed that.
[02:15:00.520 --> 02:15:04.800]   And as a child, I devoured the biographies of famous people
[02:15:04.800 --> 02:15:07.340]   because I think I was looking for clues
[02:15:07.340 --> 02:15:10.140]   about how do you live a larger life?
[02:15:10.140 --> 02:15:12.120]   I couldn't have languaged that.
[02:15:12.120 --> 02:15:14.960]   It was just some deep urge within.
[02:15:14.960 --> 02:15:19.920]   How do you live this life in a way that's more satisfying?
[02:15:19.920 --> 02:15:23.760]   And I was privileged to have some people there,
[02:15:23.760 --> 02:15:26.060]   notably teachers and a librarian,
[02:15:26.060 --> 02:15:29.520]   who gave permission to that and supported that,
[02:15:29.520 --> 02:15:31.160]   and I'm grateful to them.
[02:15:31.160 --> 02:15:36.160]   So I think it probably would have happened anyway,
[02:15:36.160 --> 02:15:39.240]   but much later in life.
[02:15:39.240 --> 02:15:42.560]   But I look back and I realize there was something there
[02:15:42.560 --> 02:15:44.320]   that wanted to go, as I said,
[02:15:44.320 --> 02:15:46.600]   to see where the airplanes went,
[02:15:46.600 --> 02:15:48.000]   what the ocean looked like,
[02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:49.800]   what it meant to live in a foreign country,
[02:15:49.800 --> 02:15:52.600]   what it meant to learn a foreign language.
[02:15:52.600 --> 02:15:57.600]   All of those things were unimaginable to my family,
[02:15:57.600 --> 02:16:00.020]   and rest their souls,
[02:16:00.020 --> 02:16:06.040]   because I grieve the life they were not allowed to live.
[02:16:06.040 --> 02:16:07.320]   I never forget that.
[02:16:07.320 --> 02:16:12.320]   And it causes me to resolve, again, to stop and say,
[02:16:13.440 --> 02:16:15.440]   all right, now, where are you being blocked today
[02:16:15.440 --> 02:16:18.480]   by convention or your old fears
[02:16:18.480 --> 02:16:21.840]   or your inhibitions or whatever?
[02:16:21.840 --> 02:16:25.440]   Because there's always a summons to show up.
[02:16:25.440 --> 02:16:27.840]   In fact, in one of the books, I said my motto,
[02:16:27.840 --> 02:16:30.640]   which I think about every morning, it's very simple.
[02:16:30.640 --> 02:16:33.620]   Shut up, suit up, show up.
[02:16:33.620 --> 02:16:35.640]   Now, I'm speaking to myself when I say this.
[02:16:35.640 --> 02:16:37.960]   Shut up means stop whining.
[02:16:37.960 --> 02:16:41.200]   You know, there are people who don't have food today.
[02:16:41.200 --> 02:16:44.160]   There are people whose children are being killed today.
[02:16:44.160 --> 02:16:46.480]   There are people who don't have a roof.
[02:16:46.480 --> 02:16:48.720]   You have tons of things.
[02:16:48.720 --> 02:16:50.320]   Shut up, don't whine.
[02:16:50.320 --> 02:16:52.040]   Speaking to myself.
[02:16:52.040 --> 02:16:54.960]   Suit up means prepare, do your homework.
[02:16:54.960 --> 02:16:57.240]   Don't expect life just to present it to you.
[02:16:57.240 --> 02:17:00.000]   You have to go out and work hard at something.
[02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:01.880]   Show up, meaning not show off,
[02:17:01.880 --> 02:17:04.160]   but just do the best you can.
[02:17:04.160 --> 02:17:07.780]   Step into life, you know.
[02:17:07.780 --> 02:17:10.480]   Sooner or later, life knocks us down.
[02:17:10.480 --> 02:17:12.560]   Death is the great democracy,
[02:17:12.560 --> 02:17:16.160]   but you're here to live it as best you can
[02:17:16.160 --> 02:17:18.280]   by lights that matter within
[02:17:18.280 --> 02:17:21.360]   instead of what people around you are saying, you know?
[02:17:21.360 --> 02:17:24.320]   And as simplistic as that slogan is,
[02:17:24.320 --> 02:17:26.000]   I know a lot of people have copied it
[02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:27.360]   and put it on their refrigerator
[02:17:27.360 --> 02:17:31.760]   because it's a reminder of this is your life.
[02:17:31.760 --> 02:17:33.360]   You're accountable.
[02:17:33.360 --> 02:17:35.000]   What are you gonna do about that?
[02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:39.800]   - I'm gonna let that sink in for everybody.
[02:17:39.800 --> 02:17:43.960]   I think shut up, suit up, show up is essential.
[02:17:43.960 --> 02:17:48.440]   I love that.
[02:17:48.440 --> 02:17:53.920]   I love Eric's stages of developmental maturation.
[02:17:53.920 --> 02:17:56.440]   For those not familiar,
[02:17:56.440 --> 02:18:00.720]   Eric's in, I think, another Dane, right?
[02:18:00.720 --> 02:18:01.560]   Is it Dane?
[02:18:01.560 --> 02:18:02.400]   Yeah.
[02:18:02.400 --> 02:18:03.720]   Psychologist, you know,
[02:18:03.720 --> 02:18:06.880]   set about to kind of explain neurobiology
[02:18:06.880 --> 02:18:08.400]   without knowing any neurobiology
[02:18:08.400 --> 02:18:11.120]   and asserted that there were specific core conflicts
[02:18:11.120 --> 02:18:12.880]   that infants and children,
[02:18:12.880 --> 02:18:14.740]   young adults and adults go through.
[02:18:14.740 --> 02:18:21.360]   And the age ranges are more variable now
[02:18:21.360 --> 02:18:24.480]   based on life expectancy and other factors
[02:18:24.480 --> 02:18:25.880]   than they were originally.
[02:18:25.880 --> 02:18:29.400]   But one reason I like Eric's stages of development so much
[02:18:29.400 --> 02:18:33.080]   is that as a developmental neurobiologist first,
[02:18:33.080 --> 02:18:35.080]   that's where I started out more or less,
[02:18:35.080 --> 02:18:37.640]   it makes perfect sense to me
[02:18:37.640 --> 02:18:40.720]   that the brain circuitry would be resolving certain things
[02:18:40.720 --> 02:18:43.040]   about interactions with physical objects
[02:18:43.040 --> 02:18:44.800]   and relational objects.
[02:18:44.800 --> 02:18:45.960]   And it just makes perfect sense.
[02:18:45.960 --> 02:18:50.960]   And what genius it was to superimpose on that
[02:18:50.960 --> 02:18:55.360]   some ideas about what infants are doing from zero to one,
[02:18:55.360 --> 02:18:57.220]   then from three to five, et cetera.
[02:18:57.220 --> 02:18:59.960]   Rarely, if ever, do we hear about
[02:18:59.960 --> 02:19:02.520]   the maturational stages of adulthood
[02:19:02.520 --> 02:19:07.520]   and the core conflicts that we all have to go through
[02:19:07.600 --> 02:19:11.720]   perhaps not exactly from age 45 to 50
[02:19:11.720 --> 02:19:15.680]   or 50 to 55 or 75 to 80 and so forth,
[02:19:15.680 --> 02:19:20.680]   but that life as it were might be a series
[02:19:20.680 --> 02:19:24.240]   of trying to make it through specific milestones.
[02:19:24.240 --> 02:19:26.960]   And when we don't make it through a milestone,
[02:19:26.960 --> 02:19:29.320]   problems arise.
[02:19:29.320 --> 02:19:30.640]   - Sure, sure.
[02:19:30.640 --> 02:19:33.200]   - You described the first half of life
[02:19:33.200 --> 02:19:36.520]   as one in which we're kind of foraging more or less
[02:19:36.520 --> 02:19:40.580]   for most people unconscious of how our parental influences
[02:19:40.580 --> 02:19:44.800]   or family influences set about certain patterns
[02:19:44.800 --> 02:19:46.240]   that may or may not be healthy for us.
[02:19:46.240 --> 02:19:48.400]   And then at some point, some event comes,
[02:19:48.400 --> 02:19:51.520]   oftentimes a painful event,
[02:19:51.520 --> 02:19:53.960]   but it could be a joyous event
[02:19:53.960 --> 02:19:56.160]   like the birth of a child or something like that.
[02:19:56.160 --> 02:19:58.640]   And all of a sudden we get hit square in the face
[02:19:58.640 --> 02:20:00.280]   with the work that we need to do.
[02:20:00.280 --> 02:20:04.080]   Would you say that the second half of life
[02:20:04.080 --> 02:20:09.080]   is one in which we, because of our life experience
[02:20:09.080 --> 02:20:10.520]   and because of some awareness,
[02:20:10.520 --> 02:20:14.780]   and yet, because also our brain is yes, still plastic,
[02:20:14.780 --> 02:20:17.240]   but it takes more work than when we're kids
[02:20:17.240 --> 02:20:19.520]   to modify our brain circuitry,
[02:20:19.520 --> 02:20:22.520]   that we have to set about this juggling act
[02:20:22.520 --> 02:20:24.920]   of still trying to understand the self
[02:20:24.920 --> 02:20:28.640]   while still bringing the self that we have into the world.
[02:20:28.640 --> 02:20:30.040]   We don't really get to pause,
[02:20:30.040 --> 02:20:35.040]   go to the shop and come out a year later in most cases.
[02:20:35.040 --> 02:20:41.200]   So regardless of whether or not somebody is 10, 15, 20,
[02:20:41.200 --> 02:20:47.160]   50 or 80 years old, how do we know what our work is then?
[02:20:47.160 --> 02:20:51.460]   Like, how do we best know like what to focus on?
[02:20:51.460 --> 02:20:53.920]   Because it can be a bit overwhelming
[02:20:53.920 --> 02:20:56.400]   to think about like tackling all of this.
[02:20:56.400 --> 02:20:57.640]   - Sure, sure.
[02:20:57.640 --> 02:21:00.720]   Well, let me say, first of all, many years ago,
[02:21:00.720 --> 02:21:03.280]   when I was still teaching at a university,
[02:21:03.280 --> 02:21:05.840]   I taught a course on life stages.
[02:21:05.840 --> 02:21:08.100]   And for one of the papers,
[02:21:08.100 --> 02:21:12.680]   I asked the students to imagine two stages ahead of them.
[02:21:12.680 --> 02:21:16.660]   So if they were typically 18 to 22, let's say,
[02:21:16.660 --> 02:21:19.240]   to imagine themselves in their 40s
[02:21:19.240 --> 02:21:21.720]   and try to write about their life in their 40s.
[02:21:21.720 --> 02:21:24.720]   And the assignment completely failed,
[02:21:24.720 --> 02:21:29.120]   although it was made useful for the classroom discussion,
[02:21:29.120 --> 02:21:32.300]   because all of them imagined in their 40s,
[02:21:32.300 --> 02:21:35.000]   they would have this perfect marriage,
[02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:38.360]   their adolescent children would adore them,
[02:21:38.360 --> 02:21:40.320]   and they would be in these satisfying careers
[02:21:40.320 --> 02:21:43.480]   despite everything we'd read, everything we talked about
[02:21:43.480 --> 02:21:47.600]   as a time of turbulence and disappointment and so forth.
[02:21:47.600 --> 02:21:49.520]   And it was a complete failure.
[02:21:49.520 --> 02:21:51.640]   So it's hard for us to imagine
[02:21:51.640 --> 02:21:55.480]   that we too will go through these similar kinds of things,
[02:21:55.480 --> 02:21:57.220]   but usually we do.
[02:21:57.220 --> 02:22:01.920]   And some of this is triggered by roles in one's life.
[02:22:01.920 --> 02:22:05.160]   A lot of it's determined by our own aging of the body
[02:22:05.160 --> 02:22:06.600]   and so forth.
[02:22:06.600 --> 02:22:11.360]   So for example, the last stage in Erickson's discussion
[02:22:11.360 --> 02:22:14.940]   in so-called old age is the conflict
[02:22:14.940 --> 02:22:17.560]   between despair and integrity.
[02:22:17.560 --> 02:22:20.260]   And I remember reading that when I was young,
[02:22:20.260 --> 02:22:22.480]   and wondering what did he really mean by that?
[02:22:22.480 --> 02:22:26.400]   Now I know that in a very personal way.
[02:22:26.400 --> 02:22:29.420]   Despair is one sees friends die,
[02:22:29.420 --> 02:22:32.000]   one sees avenues in your life closed
[02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:33.700]   that you can't possibly do that.
[02:22:33.700 --> 02:22:36.920]   You're confronted with the unlived life
[02:22:36.920 --> 02:22:38.960]   or the mistakes you made.
[02:22:38.960 --> 02:22:42.120]   You're dealing with loss of functions of the body,
[02:22:42.120 --> 02:22:45.960]   you're facing your mortality and so forth and so on.
[02:22:45.960 --> 02:22:49.000]   And how could you not despair in the face of that?
[02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:50.880]   Well, at the same time, there's again,
[02:22:50.880 --> 02:22:53.480]   the summons to accountability.
[02:22:53.480 --> 02:22:55.700]   What now is life asking of you?
[02:22:55.700 --> 02:22:58.040]   How are you to show up today
[02:22:58.040 --> 02:23:01.520]   in this changed environment, you see?
[02:23:01.520 --> 02:23:05.320]   So, the stages of life,
[02:23:05.320 --> 02:23:07.800]   and Shakespeare wrote about the seven stages of life.
[02:23:07.800 --> 02:23:10.400]   I think Erickson had eight stages.
[02:23:10.400 --> 02:23:15.400]   And again, underneath this, these things happen, right?
[02:23:15.400 --> 02:23:18.980]   And often one doesn't realize it.
[02:23:18.980 --> 02:23:20.760]   One reads about it somehow.
[02:23:20.760 --> 02:23:22.000]   It's sort of like when you're young,
[02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:23.880]   yes, I understand I'm mortal,
[02:23:23.880 --> 02:23:27.360]   but that happens to people out there.
[02:23:27.360 --> 02:23:30.220]   It's not part of my DNA, you see?
[02:23:30.220 --> 02:23:31.280]   Well, it is.
[02:23:31.280 --> 02:23:34.360]   And sooner or later, life is going to unfold,
[02:23:34.360 --> 02:23:36.360]   unless it's cut off in some way.
[02:23:36.360 --> 02:23:42.280]   And I remember reading when I was in graduate school,
[02:23:42.280 --> 02:23:44.080]   a saying in ancient Greece
[02:23:44.080 --> 02:23:46.840]   that I saw in several different environments.
[02:23:46.840 --> 02:23:49.440]   And it said, "Best of all is not to have been born.
[02:23:49.440 --> 02:23:51.420]   "Second best is to have died young."
[02:23:51.420 --> 02:23:54.700]   And I thought, gee, how awful that is, right?
[02:23:54.700 --> 02:23:57.220]   Well, I think I've understood why they were saying that.
[02:23:57.220 --> 02:24:01.880]   If you're born into the veil of tears, so to speak.
[02:24:01.880 --> 02:24:03.540]   You're born into suffering.
[02:24:03.540 --> 02:24:05.420]   You're born into mortality.
[02:24:05.420 --> 02:24:08.180]   You're born into loss, and so forth.
[02:24:08.180 --> 02:24:09.560]   If you're going to live,
[02:24:09.560 --> 02:24:11.380]   you're going to go through some of those.
[02:24:11.380 --> 02:24:12.540]   If you live long enough,
[02:24:12.540 --> 02:24:16.520]   you'll go through the loss of people you love and care about.
[02:24:16.520 --> 02:24:19.280]   You may outlive your children, as I've had an experience.
[02:24:19.280 --> 02:24:22.260]   And sooner or later,
[02:24:22.260 --> 02:24:25.220]   life will take you to these difficult places.
[02:24:25.220 --> 02:24:26.700]   And what are you going to do then?
[02:24:26.700 --> 02:24:29.100]   Who are you then, and how are you going to address that?
[02:24:29.100 --> 02:24:30.980]   And that's where the issue of integrity came in.
[02:24:30.980 --> 02:24:32.940]   And I think Erickson was right on that.
[02:24:32.940 --> 02:24:36.820]   To be a person of integrity means to integrate something,
[02:24:36.820 --> 02:24:39.660]   to pull back one's stuff,
[02:24:39.660 --> 02:24:42.080]   and sense this is who I am,
[02:24:42.080 --> 02:24:45.620]   and this is where I stand vis-a-vis this dilemma.
[02:24:45.620 --> 02:24:47.180]   That's why I said the practical question
[02:24:47.180 --> 02:24:49.100]   is how now am I to live my life
[02:24:49.100 --> 02:24:52.100]   in the face of this situation?
[02:24:52.100 --> 02:24:54.940]   That's a task that comes to each of us
[02:24:54.940 --> 02:24:58.260]   at some place in our life, and that never goes away.
[02:24:58.260 --> 02:25:02.180]   - Let's talk about death.
[02:25:02.180 --> 02:25:03.620]   - Okay.
[02:25:03.620 --> 02:25:05.420]   - I've often wondered whether or not
[02:25:05.420 --> 02:25:09.420]   the human brain's ability to
[02:25:09.420 --> 02:25:15.500]   adjust the aperture of our time perception
[02:25:15.500 --> 02:25:18.660]   is an adaptive thing,
[02:25:18.660 --> 02:25:22.780]   because were we to not be able to do that,
[02:25:22.780 --> 02:25:25.580]   we would probably always focus on the fact
[02:25:25.580 --> 02:25:27.940]   that at some point we are going to die.
[02:25:27.940 --> 02:25:32.940]   This to me is analogous to a situation in space,
[02:25:32.940 --> 02:25:37.920]   not outer space, but let's just frame it this way.
[02:25:37.920 --> 02:25:40.260]   We can orient in time,
[02:25:40.260 --> 02:25:42.740]   and in particular under conditions of stress,
[02:25:42.740 --> 02:25:45.340]   our time horizon tends to shrink.
[02:25:45.340 --> 02:25:46.420]   We have to solve for now.
[02:25:46.420 --> 02:25:47.780]   We get the troubling text message.
[02:25:47.780 --> 02:25:49.380]   Somebody that we care about is in trouble.
[02:25:49.380 --> 02:25:50.580]   We need to solve for now.
[02:25:50.580 --> 02:25:53.140]   So the time horizon has shrunk.
[02:25:53.140 --> 02:25:54.580]   We're on vacation, we're relaxed.
[02:25:54.580 --> 02:25:55.600]   Everything's taken care of.
[02:25:55.600 --> 02:25:56.740]   We're fed, we're rested.
[02:25:56.740 --> 02:25:59.340]   Our loved ones are safe, we're safe.
[02:25:59.340 --> 02:26:01.820]   And all of a sudden we can daydream.
[02:26:01.820 --> 02:26:05.100]   And so in the space domain,
[02:26:05.100 --> 02:26:08.100]   the brain can learn to navigate
[02:26:08.100 --> 02:26:10.380]   a small environment like this room,
[02:26:10.380 --> 02:26:13.080]   and in conversation we're present to this room,
[02:26:13.080 --> 02:26:17.260]   but we can also imagine that we're just two people
[02:26:17.260 --> 02:26:19.940]   among billions of other people floating on a planet
[02:26:19.940 --> 02:26:22.420]   in the galaxies, and we can expand our notion of space.
[02:26:22.420 --> 02:26:25.460]   The space-time dimensionality of perception
[02:26:25.460 --> 02:26:28.340]   of the human brain is vast,
[02:26:28.340 --> 02:26:29.740]   and it can be consciously controlled
[02:26:29.740 --> 02:26:31.180]   or unconsciously controlled.
[02:26:31.180 --> 02:26:33.940]   So that's great.
[02:26:33.940 --> 02:26:35.260]   It allows us to be functional
[02:26:35.260 --> 02:26:37.680]   in a number of different space-time dimensions.
[02:26:37.680 --> 02:26:41.620]   It also can allow us to avoid the reality,
[02:26:41.620 --> 02:26:44.380]   which is that at some point, our time here is finite.
[02:26:44.380 --> 02:26:45.360]   - Yes.
[02:26:45.360 --> 02:26:47.980]   - And the example you gave earlier
[02:26:47.980 --> 02:26:49.860]   of somebody who was just trying to pile up as much money
[02:26:49.860 --> 02:26:51.460]   to get to the end was an example, I think,
[02:26:51.460 --> 02:26:53.180]   of a shortened time horizon.
[02:26:53.180 --> 02:26:55.500]   Other compulsive behaviors,
[02:26:55.500 --> 02:26:59.260]   maybe even addictive behaviors, I would argue,
[02:26:59.260 --> 02:27:03.180]   have some component often of being a way
[02:27:03.180 --> 02:27:05.860]   to avoid the reality of death.
[02:27:05.860 --> 02:27:08.280]   It's a way of packing away the fear of death,
[02:27:08.280 --> 02:27:12.040]   because if you can create these reward-based,
[02:27:12.040 --> 02:27:14.200]   which eventually become punishment-based
[02:27:14.200 --> 02:27:15.440]   in the case of addiction,
[02:27:15.440 --> 02:27:20.120]   milestones and algorithms that the brain is running,
[02:27:20.120 --> 02:27:22.200]   solve for this now, solve for this now, solve for this,
[02:27:22.200 --> 02:27:26.100]   you stave off the reality, which is death is coming.
[02:27:26.100 --> 02:27:32.560]   Are we as humans, meaning, is it our work
[02:27:32.560 --> 02:27:34.800]   if we wish to be the most conscious,
[02:27:34.800 --> 02:27:36.500]   healthy version of ourselves,
[02:27:37.540 --> 02:27:41.860]   to understand and acknowledge our sense of mortality?
[02:27:41.860 --> 02:27:45.460]   I think of what I consider the great commencement speech
[02:27:45.460 --> 02:27:47.500]   of Steve Jobs at Stanford in 2015,
[02:27:47.500 --> 02:27:50.140]   where he talks about the knowledge of one's mortality
[02:27:50.140 --> 02:27:53.060]   is actually, in his words, more or less,
[02:27:53.060 --> 02:27:54.460]   one of the most important features
[02:27:54.460 --> 02:27:57.040]   of our self-recognition as humans.
[02:27:57.040 --> 02:27:59.700]   So that's the question.
[02:27:59.700 --> 02:28:04.080]   And then the challenge becomes how often to think about it.
[02:28:05.340 --> 02:28:07.980]   You don't want to think about it too much,
[02:28:07.980 --> 02:28:10.540]   because it can be paralyzing, it can lead,
[02:28:10.540 --> 02:28:11.800]   I mean, if we just think that we're,
[02:28:11.800 --> 02:28:14.480]   if we acknowledge that we are indeed, it's a fact,
[02:28:14.480 --> 02:28:15.900]   just two people among billions
[02:28:15.900 --> 02:28:17.300]   floating around on a planet in the middle,
[02:28:17.300 --> 02:28:20.260]   then nothing really matters, right?
[02:28:20.260 --> 02:28:23.360]   One can get the sense that our impact is zero.
[02:28:23.360 --> 02:28:26.820]   But if we overemphasize our impact,
[02:28:26.820 --> 02:28:28.100]   thinking that everything we do,
[02:28:28.100 --> 02:28:29.300]   like the movement of this book
[02:28:29.300 --> 02:28:31.820]   is going to impact molecules that then will impact,
[02:28:31.820 --> 02:28:35.860]   you'd go crazy, you'd become dysfunctional in a real way.
[02:28:35.860 --> 02:28:37.080]   So those are the two extremes.
[02:28:37.080 --> 02:28:42.060]   And I'll just kind of set that about and let for reflection,
[02:28:42.060 --> 02:28:46.420]   but in terms of our sense of our own mortality
[02:28:46.420 --> 02:28:49.060]   and what that means about our sense of life,
[02:28:49.060 --> 02:28:50.700]   seems like a pretty big topic.
[02:28:50.700 --> 02:28:52.100]   And I know you're writing a book about this,
[02:28:52.100 --> 02:28:54.280]   and I'm very excited to read it when it comes out.
[02:28:54.280 --> 02:28:57.060]   - Well, I've actually written about it before.
[02:28:57.060 --> 02:29:00.780]   The paradox here is it's mortality
[02:29:00.780 --> 02:29:02.420]   that makes this life meaningful.
[02:29:02.420 --> 02:29:08.820]   If we were immortal, we would simply do this for a century,
[02:29:08.820 --> 02:29:09.660]   then we'd get bored,
[02:29:09.660 --> 02:29:11.180]   and then we'd do something else for a century,
[02:29:11.180 --> 02:29:13.880]   and then get bored, and then something else for a century.
[02:29:13.880 --> 02:29:15.900]   Life is short, as Jung said,
[02:29:15.900 --> 02:29:18.380]   that short pause between two great mysteries.
[02:29:18.380 --> 02:29:20.040]   From whence we come, we know not.
[02:29:20.040 --> 02:29:22.740]   Whither we go, we don't know.
[02:29:22.740 --> 02:29:26.120]   The problem is the identification of the ego.
[02:29:26.120 --> 02:29:28.420]   One of the things that's occurred
[02:29:28.420 --> 02:29:30.460]   is in many traditional cultures,
[02:29:30.460 --> 02:29:34.440]   that ego was subsumed, as I said, into a larger story.
[02:29:34.440 --> 02:29:37.220]   Take away that story, and what's gonna fill that space?
[02:29:37.220 --> 02:29:42.220]   The ego, my own importance, my self-perpetuation.
[02:29:42.220 --> 02:29:44.500]   The fact that people have frozen their brains
[02:29:44.500 --> 02:29:49.240]   and wanting to be revived in some future era
[02:29:49.240 --> 02:29:52.160]   is a good example of denial, it seems to me.
[02:29:52.160 --> 02:29:58.540]   Life means something because your choices are finite.
[02:29:58.540 --> 02:30:01.040]   You don't live here forever.
[02:30:01.040 --> 02:30:04.140]   Now, when the more you identify with the ego,
[02:30:04.140 --> 02:30:06.340]   the more threatened you're gonna be by that.
[02:30:06.340 --> 02:30:09.060]   And then you begin to realize,
[02:30:09.060 --> 02:30:11.860]   all right, the center of my personality is not the ego.
[02:30:11.860 --> 02:30:15.260]   There are several things to say about this,
[02:30:15.260 --> 02:30:18.720]   none of which is proof of anything, simply observations.
[02:30:18.720 --> 02:30:22.340]   And Jung pointed this out in an essay once
[02:30:22.340 --> 02:30:24.500]   called The Soul and Death.
[02:30:24.500 --> 02:30:29.420]   The psyche doesn't seem to recognize its own termination.
[02:30:29.420 --> 02:30:31.940]   People who are overtly dying, and they know they're dying,
[02:30:31.940 --> 02:30:33.460]   and one of my patients right now
[02:30:33.460 --> 02:30:35.380]   is a glioblastoma client
[02:30:35.380 --> 02:30:38.340]   who's not going to be here in a few months,
[02:30:38.340 --> 02:30:43.980]   who's purely aware of mortality,
[02:30:43.980 --> 02:30:46.900]   but the dreams have to do with the journeys
[02:30:46.900 --> 02:30:48.980]   and crossings and things of that sort.
[02:30:48.980 --> 02:30:51.520]   In other words, as if the human psyche
[02:30:51.520 --> 02:30:53.700]   is not bound by time and space, per se,
[02:30:53.700 --> 02:30:55.580]   but the ego is.
[02:30:55.580 --> 02:31:00.020]   So if there's another life, it's another life.
[02:31:00.020 --> 02:31:01.820]   If there's a life after this, it's another life.
[02:31:01.820 --> 02:31:04.060]   This is the only one we know about for sure.
[02:31:04.060 --> 02:31:08.280]   And I would say, in terms of the fear of death,
[02:31:08.280 --> 02:31:10.940]   which most people don't wanna talk about,
[02:31:10.940 --> 02:31:13.380]   but sooner or later it comes up in therapy,
[02:31:13.380 --> 02:31:15.880]   no matter what stage of life one is involved in,
[02:31:15.880 --> 02:31:23.020]   is either there is another life of some kind
[02:31:23.620 --> 02:31:28.220]   which is larger than my imagination can conjure up,
[02:31:28.220 --> 02:31:31.380]   or there's an annihilation of this ego identity.
[02:31:31.380 --> 02:31:34.140]   Either case, my theories about it
[02:31:34.140 --> 02:31:36.640]   and my anxieties about it are rendered moot.
[02:31:36.640 --> 02:31:40.980]   So again, the more I identify with the ego consciousness,
[02:31:40.980 --> 02:31:43.380]   the more I'm tied into its perpetuation.
[02:31:43.380 --> 02:31:46.340]   The less I'm identified with that, the less it matters.
[02:31:46.340 --> 02:31:48.860]   I would say to you at this moment,
[02:31:48.860 --> 02:31:51.740]   and I'm trying to be as honest as I can about it,
[02:31:51.740 --> 02:31:55.260]   the chief thing I worry about as I approach my mortality
[02:31:55.260 --> 02:31:59.220]   is I don't want my wife to be alone.
[02:31:59.220 --> 02:32:01.320]   I care for her and I know there are areas
[02:32:01.320 --> 02:32:02.940]   where she needs my help.
[02:32:02.940 --> 02:32:07.140]   And I want to be here for her as long as I can.
[02:32:07.140 --> 02:32:09.580]   And my existence a little over a year ago
[02:32:09.580 --> 02:32:12.360]   was sort of problematic coming out of all those surgeries.
[02:32:12.360 --> 02:32:14.860]   So that's one reason we moved to a retirement community,
[02:32:14.860 --> 02:32:17.700]   so there'd be some structure there for her.
[02:32:17.700 --> 02:32:22.100]   Secondly, I don't want to suffer, obviously,
[02:32:22.100 --> 02:32:24.260]   but that's outside of my control.
[02:32:24.260 --> 02:32:27.140]   And thirdly, I'm still curious as a human being.
[02:32:27.140 --> 02:32:28.300]   There's so much to learn.
[02:32:28.300 --> 02:32:30.620]   And when we're talking about the internet and its perils,
[02:32:30.620 --> 02:32:32.820]   it's also an enormous learning tool.
[02:32:32.820 --> 02:32:35.420]   I love to Google up things and find out about things
[02:32:35.420 --> 02:32:38.420]   that used to be so difficult to learn about.
[02:32:38.420 --> 02:32:43.380]   So I'm still heavily invested in the adventure of life,
[02:32:43.420 --> 02:32:48.420]   but I'm less and less attached to it in some peculiar way.
[02:32:48.420 --> 02:32:52.500]   It's the ego attachment, you know?
[02:32:52.500 --> 02:32:57.220]   The German word gelassenheit is the word for serenity.
[02:32:57.220 --> 02:33:00.040]   It's the condition of having let go.
[02:33:00.040 --> 02:33:03.620]   And the only solution, so to speak,
[02:33:03.620 --> 02:33:07.540]   for our fear of mortality is accepting it paradoxically,
[02:33:07.540 --> 02:33:12.460]   of letting go of the fantasy of the sovereignty of the ego,
[02:33:12.460 --> 02:33:16.140]   that it's immune somehow to the natural order of things,
[02:33:16.140 --> 02:33:18.780]   the natural progression of things.
[02:33:18.780 --> 02:33:22.780]   Now, I'm not saying that makes me wholly unafraid of death.
[02:33:22.780 --> 02:33:25.960]   That would be delusional, and it's in another way,
[02:33:25.960 --> 02:33:28.820]   but I can say that I'm not defined by it in any way.
[02:33:28.820 --> 02:33:29.860]   And I think you're right.
[02:33:29.860 --> 02:33:32.220]   A lot of people, what it usually produces
[02:33:32.220 --> 02:33:35.460]   is either depression and torpor of some kind
[02:33:35.460 --> 02:33:37.120]   or frenetic activity.
[02:33:38.340 --> 02:33:42.780]   So the inability of a person to relativize the ego
[02:33:42.780 --> 02:33:45.980]   in the context of the idea of the soul,
[02:33:45.980 --> 02:33:48.720]   and does that soul perpetuate?
[02:33:48.720 --> 02:33:49.920]   I don't know.
[02:33:49.920 --> 02:33:51.380]   If I knew, I would tell you.
[02:33:51.380 --> 02:33:54.380]   I wouldn't wanna keep that a secret.
[02:33:54.380 --> 02:33:56.740]   I don't know, it's a mystery.
[02:33:56.740 --> 02:33:59.500]   Maybe I'll be conscious enough to experience it.
[02:33:59.500 --> 02:34:01.100]   Maybe I'll just be annihilated.
[02:34:01.100 --> 02:34:04.700]   Either way, as I said, my present speculations
[02:34:04.700 --> 02:34:08.140]   are just that, speculations, and ultimately irrelevant.
[02:34:08.140 --> 02:34:10.500]   And again, the thing we have to recognize,
[02:34:10.500 --> 02:34:14.260]   it's mortality that makes this life mean something,
[02:34:14.260 --> 02:34:16.300]   'cause your choices matter.
[02:34:16.300 --> 02:34:17.640]   You're here a short time.
[02:34:17.640 --> 02:34:20.660]   What are you gonna do with that precious gift
[02:34:20.660 --> 02:34:22.340]   you call your life?
[02:34:22.340 --> 02:34:23.780]   What are you gonna do with it?
[02:34:23.780 --> 02:34:30.300]   - Well, I can't think of a more appropriate place to end,
[02:34:30.300 --> 02:34:34.060]   and yet I have still so many more questions.
[02:34:34.900 --> 02:34:38.940]   But I think because of today's conversation,
[02:34:38.940 --> 02:34:41.860]   I realized that those questions are questions
[02:34:41.860 --> 02:34:46.320]   to ask of self, as I think everyone listening
[02:34:46.320 --> 02:34:49.140]   and watching this surely is stimulated
[02:34:49.140 --> 02:34:52.060]   to ask many important questions of self.
[02:34:52.060 --> 02:34:58.620]   I must say, I'm both a bit awestruck, frankly,
[02:34:58.620 --> 02:35:02.940]   because I, again, I'm familiar with your teachings
[02:35:02.940 --> 02:35:05.460]   and work in the form of books.
[02:35:05.460 --> 02:35:09.560]   And it was a great wish of mine in my life journey
[02:35:09.560 --> 02:35:13.320]   to sit down with you face-to-face and have a conversation.
[02:35:13.320 --> 02:35:17.300]   So that's why I'm speaking more slowly today
[02:35:17.300 --> 02:35:18.620]   than I normally do.
[02:35:18.620 --> 02:35:20.780]   My audience perhaps will notice that.
[02:35:20.780 --> 02:35:21.940]   And if they send some emotion,
[02:35:21.940 --> 02:35:25.000]   it's that I feel like there's just so much richness here
[02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:29.340]   to take in for myself and for everyone listening to take in.
[02:35:29.340 --> 02:35:32.160]   I'm certainly going to listen to this again
[02:35:32.160 --> 02:35:33.380]   and take careful notes.
[02:35:33.380 --> 02:35:35.780]   And we likely will put some notes and some highlights.
[02:35:35.780 --> 02:35:37.140]   We always timestamp everything
[02:35:37.140 --> 02:35:38.540]   so that people can navigate back.
[02:35:38.540 --> 02:35:42.220]   But I think there's just so many essential prompts
[02:35:42.220 --> 02:35:44.020]   of the self, of the soul
[02:35:44.020 --> 02:35:46.500]   that people are going to be motivated to take
[02:35:46.500 --> 02:35:48.940]   as a consequence of hearing your words today.
[02:35:48.940 --> 02:35:53.300]   So I just really want to say thank you so much
[02:35:53.300 --> 02:35:55.300]   for the work that you've done
[02:35:55.300 --> 02:35:57.680]   and that you're doing and continuing to do,
[02:35:58.780 --> 02:36:03.540]   and for taking the time to share this information with us,
[02:36:03.540 --> 02:36:08.540]   because it really is the guts,
[02:36:08.540 --> 02:36:11.840]   like the core stuff of being a human being.
[02:36:11.840 --> 02:36:13.280]   So thank you so much.
[02:36:13.280 --> 02:36:14.120]   - Thank you, Andrew.
[02:36:14.120 --> 02:36:16.560]   May I just add as a footnote here,
[02:36:16.560 --> 02:36:21.560]   there's a wonderful letter of the poet Rilke
[02:36:21.560 --> 02:36:23.920]   to a young man in which he said,
[02:36:23.920 --> 02:36:26.640]   "You want the answers.
[02:36:26.640 --> 02:36:29.080]   "The key is to find the right questions
[02:36:29.080 --> 02:36:30.120]   "and live the questions.
[02:36:30.120 --> 02:36:32.020]   "You're not yet ready to live the answers,
[02:36:32.020 --> 02:36:34.920]   "but you ask the right questions in time
[02:36:34.920 --> 02:36:36.580]   "if you live them honestly,
[02:36:36.580 --> 02:36:39.720]   "with as much integrity as you can manage.
[02:36:39.720 --> 02:36:43.140]   "Someday you'll live your way into their answers for you."
[02:36:43.140 --> 02:36:45.020]   And that's what I would say.
[02:36:45.020 --> 02:36:47.380]   Ask large questions.
[02:36:47.380 --> 02:36:49.120]   As children, we did.
[02:36:49.120 --> 02:36:50.300]   What was this about?
[02:36:50.300 --> 02:36:51.140]   Why am I here?
[02:36:51.140 --> 02:36:52.320]   What's the story?
[02:36:52.320 --> 02:36:53.980]   What's going on here?
[02:36:53.980 --> 02:36:56.640]   We get so inured to those questions
[02:36:56.640 --> 02:36:59.700]   by our adaptive necessities.
[02:36:59.700 --> 02:37:01.840]   And we have to come back to those questions.
[02:37:01.840 --> 02:37:03.520]   I'm still asking those questions.
[02:37:03.520 --> 02:37:05.320]   I do it consciously now.
[02:37:05.320 --> 02:37:06.820]   Ask large questions.
[02:37:06.820 --> 02:37:08.680]   You'll live a large and interesting journey.
[02:37:08.680 --> 02:37:12.220]   Ask small questions and it gets diminished somehow.
[02:37:12.220 --> 02:37:15.680]   Another thing I say to a lot of patients,
[02:37:15.680 --> 02:37:18.440]   when you reach a decisive point in your life,
[02:37:18.440 --> 02:37:21.080]   we have to make a decision one way or the other.
[02:37:21.080 --> 02:37:23.800]   Ask, does this path enlarge me?
[02:37:23.800 --> 02:37:24.980]   Psycho-spiritually?
[02:37:24.980 --> 02:37:26.180]   Or does it diminish me?
[02:37:26.180 --> 02:37:29.040]   And you usually know the answer to that.
[02:37:29.040 --> 02:37:30.940]   If you choose the larger path,
[02:37:30.940 --> 02:37:32.020]   you're gonna grow and develop.
[02:37:32.020 --> 02:37:34.060]   It's gonna take something out of you,
[02:37:34.060 --> 02:37:35.980]   but it'll give something to you.
[02:37:35.980 --> 02:37:38.340]   If you don't, your life gets narrower
[02:37:38.340 --> 02:37:39.580]   and narrower and narrower.
[02:37:39.580 --> 02:37:41.740]   And something inside of you knows the difference.
[02:37:41.740 --> 02:37:44.700]   And sooner or later, the psyche's gonna show up
[02:37:44.700 --> 02:37:46.080]   with its point of view.
[02:37:46.080 --> 02:37:49.820]   And the more we fled from that kind of question,
[02:37:49.820 --> 02:37:51.500]   that kind of conversation,
[02:37:51.500 --> 02:37:54.660]   the more pathology is gonna erupt
[02:37:54.660 --> 02:37:56.660]   when we've avoided the big question.
[02:37:56.660 --> 02:38:00.280]   So thank you for asking big questions
[02:38:00.280 --> 02:38:01.700]   and thank you for inviting me
[02:38:01.700 --> 02:38:03.180]   to be part of this conversation today.
[02:38:03.180 --> 02:38:05.020]   It's been a privilege and a pleasure.
[02:38:05.020 --> 02:38:07.180]   - Thank you so much.
[02:38:07.180 --> 02:38:09.280]   Thank you for joining me for today's discussion

[02:38:50.100 --> 02:38:53.660]   So that's Instagram, X, LinkedIn, Facebook, and threads.
[02:38:53.660 --> 02:38:55.160]   And on all of those platforms,
[02:38:55.160 --> 02:38:57.220]   I discuss science and science-related tools,
[02:38:57.220 --> 02:38:58.740]   some of which overlaps with the content
[02:38:58.740 --> 02:39:00.120]   of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[02:39:00.120 --> 02:39:01.860]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[02:39:01.860 --> 02:39:03.580]   covered on the Huberman Lab podcast.
[02:39:03.580 --> 02:39:06.860]   So again, it's Huberman Lab on all social media channels.

[02:39:22.060 --> 02:39:24.740]   as well as protocols on growth mindset and on and on.
[02:39:24.740 --> 02:39:26.620]   Again, all available, zero cost.

[02:39:43.180 --> 02:39:45.760]   (upbeat music)
[02:39:45.760 --> 02:39:48.340]   (upbeat music)
