[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.360]   We close the week with an important question from a listener named Anthony in San Diego
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.120]   about whether God's happiness is contingent on our happiness.
[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.760]   And it'll make sense here in just a moment.
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:16.760]   Here's the email.
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.200]   "Hello Pastor John, thank you for taking my question.
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.400]   I am very curious to get your thoughts on the following quote I found in J.I.
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.280]   Packer's book, Knowing God, a classic.
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:32.400]   J.I. Packer writes this, "God was happy without humans before they were made.
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.480]   He would have continued to be happy had he simply destroyed them after they had sinned.
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:43.180]   But as it is, he has set his love upon particular sinners, and this means that by his own free
[00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:50.040]   voluntary choice, he will not know perfect and unmixed happiness again until he has brought
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.400]   every one of them to heaven.
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:59.880]   He has in effect resolved that henceforth, for all eternity, his happiness shall be conditional
[00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.200]   upon ours."
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:08.000]   Okay, so that last line, "his happiness shall be conditional upon ours," it's tough for
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.160]   me to swallow.
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.240]   I think I understand what he's saying, but I would love to hear your take on this.
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.800]   How would you take this line, Pastor John?
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:24.240]   That quote from Packer is found on page 125 in my edition of Knowing God, and I mention
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.760]   it just because I'd like every one of our listeners to read Knowing God.
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.440]   I just think it's a classic.
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:37.680]   It's sold a million-plus copies way over, and it's so foundational, and it's chock-full
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.000]   of good sentences like that.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.160]   So the sentence that Anthony is having a hard time swallowing says, "God has in effect
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:56.400]   resolved that henceforth, for all eternity, his happiness shall be conditional upon ours."
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.880]   Here's why I think that sentence sticks in our craw.
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.360]   If you didn't know J.I.
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.080]   Packer, if you didn't know the wider context of the book or his theology, the word "conditional"
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:20.600]   might imply to you that Packer has made God's joy dependent on our self-determining achievement
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:28.400]   of joy so that the achievement of it appears uncertain, and therefore God's joy appears
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.120]   uncertain, and if that's true, he's not God.
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.240]   This is a big deal.
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:45.080]   A God who is making his happiness dependent on his creatures and then crossing his fingers
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:55.400]   in the hope that their happiness will be achieved decisively by them is not God.
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.800]   So he's raising an important question.
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:07.240]   Therefore, in addition toâ€”not instead of, but in addition to saying that God's happiness
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:18.400]   is conditional upon ours, we need to say also that God's happiness is the invincible pursuit
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.240]   of ours.
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:29.720]   Or to put it another way, God's joy is not only a response to our joy in him, God's
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:36.280]   joy is also the cause of our joy in him.
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:47.200]   Or to put it yet another way, the entire plan and history of salvation is the overflow of
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:55.600]   God's joy bringing into being through Jesus Christ a glorious family of believers who
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.600]   share in his joy.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:07.200]   So God is not waiting to see if we will become happy by the use of our self-determining powers
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.080]   so that he can then be happy in response to our happiness.
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.160]   No, no, no.
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.280]   God is not waiting to see.
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:24.040]   God is eternally happy in the Trinity, and his happiness is overflowing with creation
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:33.080]   and redemption and the whole process of bringing us to the point where we have fullness of
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:38.360]   joy in his presence and pleasures at his right hand.
[00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:48.280]   So, the way to think about God's joy being conditional upon our joy is that he takes
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:58.480]   pleasure in the pleasure that we have in him, which he himself brought about in us.
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:10.360]   So yes, yes, his joy is conditional upon ours, but not with any degree of uncertainty that
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:17.280]   our joy will come about and that our joy in him will be full.
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:27.120]   That's certain because that's what he's pursuing with omnipotent resolve.
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:33.680]   He has not just resolved, like Packer says, he has not just resolved to make our happiness
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:42.960]   the condition of his, he has also resolved to make our happiness the creation of his.
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:50.560]   So Jesus says, for example, in Luke 12.32, "Fear not, little flock.
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:56.960]   It is your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom."
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:04.360]   In other words, God's not pictured here as standing by, watching, wondering whether we
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.080]   get happily into the kingdom and then rejoicing that we're in.
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:16.800]   Instead, the picture is God's great joy, his good pleasure, as Jesus calls it, his
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:23.720]   good pleasure is to give us the kingdom, is to get us into the joy of the kingdom.
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:31.240]   So yes, by all means, according to Luke 15.7, there will be more joy in heaven, including
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:39.040]   God's joy, more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over 99 persons who don't
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.040]   need any repentance.
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.960]   Yes, indeed, that's true.
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:52.440]   But the very repentance that brought about God's joy in heaven was the gift of God,
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.960]   and he didn't give it begrudgingly.
[00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:55.960]   He gave it joyfully.
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.240]   This is his good pleasure.
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:04.620]   It is his good pleasure to get us into the kingdom by repentance.
[00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:06.080]   So how do we get in?
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:11.800]   How do we get into the covenant where our sins are forgiven, the law is written on our
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:16.760]   hearts, we delight to do the will of God so that God delights in our happy obedience?
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.640]   How do we get in there?
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:23.840]   And here's the answer of Jeremiah 32, one of my favorite passages in all the Bible,
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.040]   Jeremiah 32, 40.
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:32.040]   I will make with them an everlasting covenant that I will not turn away from doing good
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:40.760]   to them, and I will put the fear of me in their hearts so that they may not turn from
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:46.680]   me, and I will rejoice in doing them good.
[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:51.200]   And with all my heart and with all my soul.
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:59.560]   So yes, God's joy is driving him in total freedom to bring his people into the covenant
[00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:07.520]   and keep them in the covenant and make them glad in the covenant with the very gladness
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:15.760]   of God, just like Jesus says in, I forget, Matthew 25 somewhere, 41, I think, "Enter
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:18.840]   into the joy of your master."
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:21.160]   We enter into the joy of Jesus.
[00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.560]   And then, as J.I.
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:31.520]   Packer says, God himself rejoices over us, and our joy in Jesus becomes a constituent
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:36.280]   part of God's joy in us.
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:41.520]   As it says in Zephaniah 3, 17, "The Lord your God is in your midst, a mighty one who
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:42.520]   will save.
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:45.600]   He will rejoice over you with gladness.
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.160]   He will quiet you with his love.
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:53.160]   He will exult over you with loud singing."
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.480]   Zephaniah 3, 17.
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:56.480]   Great verse.
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:58.120]   So, three cheers for J.I.
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:08.720]   Packer, and 3,000 cheers for God, who not only has made our joy in him, the condition
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:18.400]   of his joy in us, but has also made our joy in him, the creation of his joy in us.
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:23.560]   A beautifully intricate plan, all orchestrated for our joy and for God's glory simultaneously.
[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:24.560]   So good.
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:25.560]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:29.880]   And again, we're talking about the classic book today, Knowing God by J.I.
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:30.880]   Packer.
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.400]   And if you've not read it, do it.
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:36.840]   Make it a priority to get this book read in your diet in 2018.
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:41.640]   You'll have to part with about 12 bucks at Amazon, which is chicken feed compared to
[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.360]   the glory that you'll find inside of it.
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:47.180]   Thank you for listening and for making the podcast part of your week.
[00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:50.960]   You can subscribe to our audio feeds and search our past episodes in our archive, and even
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:56.840]   send us an email of your own, even questions related to God's happiness and his happiness
[00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:57.980]   in us.
[00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:01.580]   Those are always most fitting for our APJ podcast.
[00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:02.840]   Thank you for this question, Anthony.
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:06.800]   You can do all of those things that I just mentioned at our online home at DesiringGod.com.
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:17.440]   Well, we believe it is God's design to raise up a few qualified men to lead the local church.
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:20.520]   Not all men inside the local church, just a few men.
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:26.440]   Most men are not called to lead churches as pastors, but elders are exclusively male according
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:29.500]   to the pastoral epistles of the New Testament.
[00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:34.680]   So when it comes to seminary professors, is there a role for women to lead courses in
[00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:36.400]   seminaries or not?
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:38.040]   It's a big question.
[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:42.680]   It opens up a big conversation about God's design for pastoral training.
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:46.280]   And that's the next question on the table when we return on Monday.
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:47.280]   Should be interesting.
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:48.940]   Until then, I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:49.940]   Have a wonderful weekend.
[00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:49.960]   We'll see you then.
