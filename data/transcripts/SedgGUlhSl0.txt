[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480]   [Silence]
[00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:04.520]   How you think about stress
[00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.800]   impacts the stress response in profound ways.
[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.560]   So this paper, "Rethinking Stress,
[00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.080]   The Role of Mindsets in Determining Stress"
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.040]   did a very simple set of manipulations.
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.520]   They had people in one group listen to a lecture
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.240]   that effectively was titled, quote,
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.360]   "The effects of stress are negative and should be avoided."
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.600]   And that lecture included information
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.160]   about how stress diminishes performance
[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.840]   and how it can diminish health and vitality
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.320]   learning and performance, productivity,
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.640]   it increases uncertainty, et cetera, okay?
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.640]   And all of that information is true.
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.400]   A separate group listened to a lecture entitled, quote,
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.840]   "Experiencing stress improves health and vitality."
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.020]   And again, that information is true.
[00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.000]   Now, I realize that some of you are probably still asking,
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.200]   how can it be that stress diminishes health and performance
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.760]   and stress also enhances health and performance?
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.240]   And the answer lies in two things.
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.400]   One, the level of stress,
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.880]   and therefore the level of hormones that are released
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.220]   in response to that stress,
[00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.320]   the duration over which the stress response occurs.
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.600]   But the key variable here is that our cognitive understanding
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.200]   about what stress does impacts whether or not
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.540]   our physiology goes down the direction of debilitating
[00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.560]   or enhancing effects of stress, okay?
[00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.920]   So we've got a condition here
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.080]   where people are being informed very differently
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.220]   about what stress does.
[00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.240]   In one case, it's the stress is bad message.
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.800]   In the other case, it's the stress is good message.
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.520]   And there are many different experiments within this paper,
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.240]   but one of the more interesting ones I believe
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.480]   is where they looked at work performance,
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.100]   both in terms of performance of what they call soft tasks.
[00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.440]   So these are somewhat easier tasks as well as hard tasks.
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.900]   And when you look at the group that was given information
[00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.800]   about how stress diminishes performance in the soft tasks,
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.600]   okay, so the somewhat easy tasks,
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.140]   you don't see much change in their performance
[00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.720]   as you compare the before the learning
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.400]   about stress is diminishing to after the learning.
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.400]   Whereas the people who learn that stress is enhancing
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.800]   actually experience some improvement in work performance,
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.720]   even though the challenge that they're facing
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:11.720]   isn't that great.
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.040]   So again, what this means is that learning that stress
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.240]   can enhance performance by providing people true information
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.320]   about how stress can enhance performance,
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.480]   can increase performance even in the context of stuff
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.620]   that's not that hard, not that stressful.
[00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.900]   Even more interesting is that when you look at performance
[00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.800]   on tasks that are considered hard
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.760]   and you compare the stress is diminishing group,
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.600]   meaning the group that was taught that stress is diminishing
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.800]   and compare that to the stress is enhancing group,
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.000]   you see a really divergent response.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.140]   The people that learn that stress diminishes performance
[00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.720]   did not improve at all.
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.200]   Whereas the people that learn that stress
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.520]   can enhance performance,
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.000]   enhance their performance significantly.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.640]   Now keep in mind, all they are doing is learning
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.400]   that stress can enhance their performance
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.920]   and then they're given a task
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.400]   and they're performing better.
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.960]   So that's pretty spectacular, right?
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.400]   There's no training session that they went and did.
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.840]   They didn't practice these items
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.920]   that they were being tested on in between.
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.440]   They weren't given a bunch of drills to do
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.160]   and they didn't take a lot of time to do it.
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.720]   They just heard a tutorial
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.880]   about how stress can enhance performance.
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.240]   And that I believe is remarkable
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.040]   because what it says is that our cognitive appraisal
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.240]   about stress, which we all are going to experience in life,
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.640]   right, elevated heart rate, narrowing of visual focus,
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.560]   shifting of blood away from the periphery.
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.440]   All of these things are characteristic features
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.920]   of the stress response that we learn,
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.000]   especially in this day and age,
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.440]   'cause it's talked about a lot in popular culture,
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.520]   that, oh, you know, all of these mechanisms
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.920]   were put into us in order for us to get away
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.240]   from the saber-toothed tiger
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.600]   or the lion that's trying to eat us.
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:43.520]   Let's be fair.
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.280]   The stress response is there for a lot of reasons,
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.560]   not just because of saber-toothed tigers and lions.
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.960]   I mean, that's kind of a story that we make up.
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.380]   The stress response is inherent, not just to us,
[00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.160]   but to other species as a way to mobilize us
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.440]   either away from things or toward things, right?
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.160]   We need to have somewhat of a stress response
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.520]   in order to engage in adaptive challenge.
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.100]   Yes, it's true that hundreds and thousands of years ago,
[00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.240]   those adaptive challenges probably involved hunting,
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.780]   but they probably involved social challenges as well.
[00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.540]   Do you think it was easy for cavemen and women
[00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.920]   to engage socially and kind of settle out
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.880]   their romantic interactions, et cetera?
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.680]   Do you think it was easy for them to raise children?
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.720]   No, of course not.
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.060]   The stress response is there for a variety of reasons,
[00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.100]   not just to get away from predators.
[00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.760]   The really exciting thing that's been discovered
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.760]   in the course of Ali Crum's work
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.800]   and other work in the last couple of decades
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.500]   is that the stress response is neither good nor bad.
[00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.360]   The stress response depends on whether or not
[00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.840]   you believe the sensations that you're experiencing,
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.480]   elevated heart rate, narrowing of visual focus, et cetera,
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.520]   are serving to enhance your performance
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.080]   or diminish your performance.
[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.840]   And this study really points to the fact
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.120]   that just learning that it can enhance performance,
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.060]   can enhance performance.
[00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.620]   Now, I know a number of you are probably saying,
[00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.020]   "Wait, but stress doesn't feel good," right?
[00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.780]   And oftentimes we experience stress under conditions
[00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.780]   where we're trying to learn or get good at something
[00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.260]   or listen better or do something,
[00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.340]   and it actually is diminishing performance.
[00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.820]   And I think it's important to acknowledge that.
[00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.300]   This study and studies like it are not saying
[00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.700]   that stress becomes pleasant as a sensation in the body,
[00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.820]   nor is it saying that it always leads
[00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.320]   to improved performance.
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.120]   I don't want you to think that's the take-home message.
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.980]   Sometimes it does, it can,
[00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:24.740]   as was demonstrated in this research paper.
[00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.540]   But oftentimes, as we know,
[00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.280]   stress diminishes our performance.
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.700]   It takes us away from the landmarks we want to hit.
[00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.540]   It takes us away from the grades we want to get.
[00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.140]   It takes us away from, quote unquote,
[00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:36.980]   showing up how we want to, right?
[00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.260]   No one wants to have the blotchy skin and the sweating
[00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:40.740]   and the quaking of voice when we're trying
[00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.940]   to do public speaking and things of that sort.
[00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.760]   No one wants any of that.
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.200]   What's important to understand is that learning that stress
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.700]   is a way of mobilizing resources in the body
[00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:51.540]   does two things.
[00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:55.280]   First of all, it allows us to dampen
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.460]   or adjust the stress response in real time.
[00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.420]   And it allows us to understand that that stress response
[00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:04.440]   heightens our level of focus in a way that allows us
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.700]   to pay attention to the things that are going wrong
[00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.100]   in a way that allows us to make correction
[00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:11.740]   to those errors in the future.
[00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.040]   So if you think back to that study, that ERP study,
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.260]   where they measured brain activity
[00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.100]   and they looked at people who had a fixed mindset
[00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.160]   versus people who had a growth mindset,
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.080]   and the people who had a growth mindset
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.080]   were paying more cognitive attention
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.860]   to what was happening during errors and after errors.
[00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:30.460]   Well, this stress is enhancing mindset is very powerful
[00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:33.800]   because what it does is it shifts one's attention
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.460]   away from kind of somatic experience of,
[00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:37.820]   oh my goodness, my heart rate is elevated,
[00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:40.420]   I'm sweating, I'm quaking, I sound terrible,
[00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:42.620]   I feel terrible, I look terrible, et cetera,
[00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:44.840]   to a mode of allocating more of our thinking
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:48.000]   toward analyzing why things might be going wrong.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.680]   And something else powerful happens
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.720]   when we embrace a stress is enhancing mindset as well.
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.400]   When we embrace a stress is enhancing mindset,
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.920]   it turns out that some of the very physiological processes
[00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:03.000]   that we call quote unquote stress shift in important ways.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.320]   Some of those include the duration over which
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.480]   the stress hormone cortisol is released.
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.000]   And in fact, I don't even really wanna call it
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.600]   a stress hormone because cortisol does
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.980]   so many other things as well, and it's not bad.
[00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:16.440]   You need cortisol, believe me, you want cortisol,
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:18.040]   especially released early in the day
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.840]   and in response to acute stressors.
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.400]   What you don't want is for cortisol to stay elevated
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.160]   for long, long periods of time,
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.840]   and you especially don't want it
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.960]   to interfere with your sleep, okay?
[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.880]   So much so that I think at times I wonder
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.360]   whether or not our philosophy on stress should be
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.480]   that stress is fantastic for us
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:38.560]   except when it interferes with our sleep, right?
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.800]   And when stress becomes terrible for us
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.000]   is when it starts to be chronically elevated
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.580]   and especially when it starts to inhibit our ability
[00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:48.500]   to sleep well enough and long enough, okay?
[00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:51.700]   So the point here is that when we embrace
[00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:54.120]   a stress enhancing mindset,
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:58.360]   we are able to have shorter duration release of cortisol.
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.060]   We are also able to engage what's called
[00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:03.820]   increased stroke volume under conditions of stress.
[00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:05.460]   This gets a little bit technical,
[00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:07.540]   but the amount of blood that your heart can pump
[00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:10.360]   with each beat turns out to be a key metric of stress.
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:11.380]   When we are very stressed,
[00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:13.660]   even though we need to mobilize a lot of resources,
[00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.220]   somewhat paradoxically,
[00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:18.720]   our total stroke volume can actually be reduced.
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:21.580]   And we tend to shuttle blood and other resources
[00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:24.700]   towards the core of our body and towards major limbs
[00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:27.500]   and away from things like our brain and our periphery.
[00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:30.460]   So one of the key measures of how a stress response
[00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:32.020]   quote unquote is going
[00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:34.440]   is how much peripheral blood flow there is.
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:37.180]   And when we are more relaxed under conditions of stress,
[00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:38.900]   there tends to be more peripheral blood flow.
[00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:41.140]   When we are more anxious,
[00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:43.100]   more panicked under conditions of stress,
[00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:45.060]   peripheral blood flow is lower.
[00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:47.980]   And in a remarkable set of experiments,
[00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:50.100]   Ali Crum and colleagues have shown
[00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:52.860]   that when we are just taught that stress can be enhancing,
[00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:55.380]   and then we are placed into a stressful environment,
[00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:57.140]   either because we are imagining stress
[00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:59.020]   or we are experiencing real stress,
[00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:01.860]   and then our physiology is measured.
[00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:06.100]   What is observed is that the total amount of blood
[00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:07.700]   that the heart can pump with each beat
[00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:10.940]   is actually increased, peripheral blood flow increases.
[00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:12.860]   And our ability to maintain cognition,
[00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:15.900]   to think clearly under conditions of stress increases.
[00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:18.220]   And again, the only manipulation here
[00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:21.020]   is a tutorial about how stress can be enhancing,
[00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:23.580]   which is essentially what I'm telling you right now.
