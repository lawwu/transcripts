[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   (music)
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   In his first 17 years of pastoring, John Piper never preached a sermon series on the meaning of baptism.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   He would come to call it a "gaping hole" that needed to be filled, and it was.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   In 1997, during the month of May, he led his church in a four-part sermon series on the biblical importance and practice of water baptism.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   Part three of the series is titled "What is Baptism, and Does it Save?"
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   It delves into baptism controversies.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   And knowing that, he began the message with a helpful word about controversies in general,
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   and I want to share that word today on the podcast.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   Last Wednesday, in episode 1658, we talked about controversy and how to argue like a Calvinist.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   And there we looked at the gentleness of John Newton in the midst of a dispute,
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   a model he took directly from the Apostle Paul's warning that pastors "must not be quarrelsome, but kind, able to teach,
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   and know the art of correcting opponents with gentleness."
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   2 Timothy 2, verses 24 and 25.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   What is clear, clear in Paul's day, clear in Newton's era, and clear in our own day,
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   is that doctrinal controversies cannot be avoided.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   They are essential to upholding the truth, but controversies can also become deadly,
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   and Pastor John explains why today.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   In this sermon, he's going to read an excerpt from Puritan John Owen,
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   talking about the deadly dangers of theological debate.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   And it's so good, I want to begin by reading that John Owen quote, what he wrote over 300 years ago.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   Listen to this as John Owen explains the importance of the heart in theological controversy.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Owen writes this,
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   "We are cast indeed into the mold of the doctrine that the mind embraces,
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   when the evidence and necessity of the truth abides in us,
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   when not only the sense of words is in our heads, but the sense of the things abides in our heart.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   When we have communion with God in the doctrine we contend for,
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   then shall we be garrisoned by the grace of God against all the assaults of men."
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   That is in controversies.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   "And without this all our contending is, as to ourselves, of no value.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   What am I the better if I can dispute that Christ is God,
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   but have no sense or sweetness in my heart from this, that He is a God in covenant with my soul?
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   What will it avail me to demonstrate by testimonies and arguments that He has made satisfaction for sin,
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   if, through my unbelief, the wrath of God abides on me,
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   and I have no experience of my own being made the righteousness of God in Him?
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   If I find not in my standing before God the excellency of having my sins imputed to Him and His righteousness imputed to me?
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Will it be of any advantage to me to profess and dispute that God works the conversion of a sinner
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   by the irresistible grace of His Spirit,
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   if I was never acquainted experimentally with the deadness and utter impotency to do good,
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   that opposition to the law of God which is in my own soul by nature,
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   without the efficacy of the exceeding greatness of the power of God in quickening,
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   enlightening, and bringing forth the fruits of obedience in me?
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Let us then not think that we are anything the better for our convictions of the truth,
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   of the great doctrines of the gospel for which we contend with men,
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   unless we find the power of the truths abiding in our own hearts,
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   and have a continual experience of their necessity and excellency in our standing before God and in our communion with Him."
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   End quote.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Wow, that is a powerful warning.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   And with this warning in mind, Pastor John opened his controversial sermon on baptism,
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   explaining why doctrinal dispute is essential and why it's also potentially deadly.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   Now, unfortunately, this sermon is one of the rare messages in which the audio recording has been lost.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   So I'm going to now read what Pastor John wrote in his sermon manuscript.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Quote, "Let me begin today with a brief introductory word about controversy.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   The main thing I want to say is that doctrinal controversy is essential and deadly.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   And the attitude towards controversy in various groups of Christians depends largely on which of these two they feel most strongly.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Is it essential or is it deadly?
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   My plea is that at Bethlehem we believe and feel both of these.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Controversy is essential where precious truth is rejected or distorted,
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   and controversy is deadly where disputation about truth dominates exaltation in truth.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   The reason controversy is essential in the face of rejection and distortion is that God has ordained that the truth be maintained in the world partly by human defense.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   For example, Paul says in Philippians 1.7 that he is in prison for the "defense and confirmation of the gospel."
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   And Jude 3 says that we should "contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints."
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   And Acts 17.2-3 says that Paul's custom in the synagogue was to reason from the scriptures and explain and give evidence that Jesus was the Christ.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   So the preservation and transmission of precious truth from person to person and generation to generation may require controversy where truth is rejected or distorted.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   But controversy is also deadly because it feels threatening, and so it tends to stir up defensiveness and anger.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   It's deadly also because it focuses on the reasons for truth rather than the reality behind truth,
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   and so tends to replace exaltation in the truth with disputation about the truth.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   This is deadly because thinking rightly about truth is not an end in itself. It's a means towards the goal of love and worship.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   Paul said in 1 Timothy 1.5 that "the goal of our instruction is love."
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   And he prayed in Philippians 1.9-11 that our "love abound in knowledge unto the glory and praise of God."
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   Controversy tends to threaten both love and praise. It's hard to revel in a love poem while arguing with someone about whether or not your sweetheart wrote it.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   So controversy is essential in this fallen world, and controversy is deadly in a fallen world.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   We must do it, and we must tremble to do it.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   A wise counselor for us, and this is John Owen, the Puritan pastor from 340 years ago,
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   he was involved in many controversies in his day, theological and denominational and political.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   But he never ceased to be a deep lover of God and a faithful pastor of a flock.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   He counsels us like this concerning doctrinal controversy.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   "When the heart is cast indeed into the mold of the doctrine that the mind embraces,
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   when the evidence and necessity of the truth abides in us,
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   when not only the sense of words in our heads, but the sense of the things abides in our hearts,
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   when we have communion with God in the doctrine we contend for,
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   then shall we be garrisoned by the grace of God against all the assaults of men."
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   I think that was the key to Owen's life and ministry. He didn't just contend for doctrine,
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   he loved and fellowshiped with the God behind the doctrine.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   The key phrase is this one, "when we have communion with God in the doctrine we contend for,
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   then shall we be garrisoned by the grace of God against all the assaults of men."
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   In other words, we must not let disputation replace contemplation and exaltation.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   I am keenly aware that this series of messages on baptism is more controversial than usual.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   I am also eager that this pulpit avoid two great errors,
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   losing the truth in the quest for exaltation and losing worship in the noise of disputation.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   So let us all pray that in our lives and in our church we walk the tightrope balanced
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   by the necessity of controversy on the one side and the dangers of it on the other.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   End of quote, end of paper.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   That's a good warning on controversy.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   If you want to see the entire baptism series, it's all online.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   Part one is titled, "I Baptize You with Water," May 4, 1997.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   Part two, "Buried and Raised in Baptism Through Faith," May 11, 1997.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   Part three, the one I just quoted from, "What is Baptism and Does It Save," May 18, 1997.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   Part four, "What Baptism Portrays," May 25, 1997.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   Audio is available for the other three parts of this sermon series,
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   just this one that there wasn't.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   Well, Friday we return with a sensitive intimacy question
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   that every couple is going to address at some point, implicitly or explicitly.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   I'll just leave it at that.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   We'll see you back here on Friday.
