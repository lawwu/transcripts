[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   So what are some tools that we can use to enhance our recovery?
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Yeah, let's start off with that acute overload phase.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   So in other words, I just did a workout and I'm feeling awful,
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   or I just did one two days ago and I'm super sore.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   How do I get rid of that right now?
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   Well, there's a couple of things you can do immediately after your workout,
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   and then others that are maybe more actionable a day later or two days later.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   And we'll just cover a handful of them.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   We'll do some nutrition and hydration and supplementation in the next episode.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   I'm going to cover everything else not in that category right now.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   So a couple of things.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   Number one, you can actually kickstart that recovery process
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   at the end of your current training session.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   And I guess I should say it this way.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   I strongly suggest you start this recovery process immediately after the workout.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   You mentioned earlier about this idea of you've got to get a really high peak of stress
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   to cause adaptation, but I actually didn't explain that correctly
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   because what has to happen is you need that extremely high peak,
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   but then you have to be met with an extremely sharp recovery back down.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   And so, you know, you've talked about this before in some of your neuroplasticity stuff
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   and in terms of what has to happen that caused the insult,
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   and then you immediately need to be able to recover to make sure that that causes changes.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   Same thing happens here.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   So we need a really sharp and high inflammatory response,
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   and then if you do not meet it with an immediate recovery period,
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   the signal won't be there to maximize your results.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   So what's that mean?
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   You can actually do a couple of things.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Number one is actually listening to slow-paced music.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   There's evidence to suggest fast-paced music may slow down your recovery
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   and slow-paced would actually enhance it.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   So if you just change from, you know, your maximum get you up and get going music
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   during the workout to a slower, lower cadence, that will help you kickstart the idea.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Of a similar note, you can also use what we call down-regulation breathing.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   You could do them in conjunction or one or the other, whichever is up to you.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   So my personal favorite method here is somewhere between 3 to 10 minutes
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   of finishing your training session, laying down.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   I like to be in that position.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   You can certainly do it in the lotus position,
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   but I think laying on your back is generally more effective.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Personal preference there, no science.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   I like the eyes being covered, getting into this dark, quiet sort of area.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   And then just breathing through your nose in a structured cadence.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   There's a lot of different things you can try.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   An easy example is just box breathing.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   So you can imagine a box having four squares.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   So what you're going to do is inhale for somewhere between like 3 to 8 seconds,
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   and whatever number you choose, you keep that same tempo.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   So let's say you chose to do a 5-second inhale.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   That's going to take you up vertically,
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   and then horizontally for your box is a 5-second hold,
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   and then a 5-second exhale, and then a 5-second hold.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   And you just need to repeat that for the time domain.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   I typically honestly don't use a timer.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   You'll actually notice a lot of people will like fall asleep
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   or get really close to falling asleep in this period.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   You could do a triangle version of that where you do an inhale, hold, exhale,
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   and then go right back into your inhale.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   There's a bunch of different tricks you can try here.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   You need to play around and see what actually works best for you.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   10 minutes is probably better, but if you can just at least give me 3, that'll work.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   If you're really, really resistant, you can actually do that just in the shower.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   And so if you're going to finish your workout, get in the shower,
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   again just close your eyes in the shower, give me 3 minutes of focused relaxation breathing,
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   and that will accelerate the recovery process.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   I love it, and I particularly love it
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   because my laboratory works on stress and respiration, a.k.a. breathing,
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   and the interactions between the two.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   And I'll just mention a result that was just accepted for publication,
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   so it should be out by the time this episode airs.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Thank you.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   This is the beautiful work of not me directly, although it took place in my lab,
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   but as we know, it's the students at Postdocs who really do the heavy lifting
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   of Dr. Malisse Balbon in my lab.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   She's a phenomenal researcher that showed that a short period of 5 minutes of box breathing,
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   of exactly the type that you described, or cyclic sighing,
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   so two inhales followed by an extended exhale to lungs empty,
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   ideally the inhales are done through the nose, the exhales are done through the mouth,
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   although it could all be done through the nose, or the mouth for that matter,
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   but probably nose, nose for inhale, inhale, mouth for exhale,
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   or inhales through the nose and exhale through the nose,
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   cyclic sighing as we refer to it, done for 5 minutes,
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   both of those produce very significant decreases in resting heart rate.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Over time it will increase things like heart rate variability and so on and so forth.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   So provided that there are extended exhales,
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   it seems like the calming response and the reduction in overall stress occurs.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   The only thing that really sends things in the other direction
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   would be something like cyclic hyperventilation, I'm sure you've observed that.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   And interestingly, when we had people just do 5 minutes of meditation,
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   during which of course they are breathing,
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   but they're just allowing their breathing to progress however it happens to be in that moment,
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   or moments across the 5 minutes,
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   there were reductions in the same sorts of markers of stress that I described,
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   but not as significant as breathing.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   So I love the Brock's breathing tool post-workout,
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   and there's some other alternatives there too that I just mentioned.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   But I think people greatly underestimate the potency of breathing
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   for shifting one's nervous system function away from stress,
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   or if one wants, toward more alertness and stress.
