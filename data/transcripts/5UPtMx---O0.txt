[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920]   Very well, now let us turn to the words that are to be found in the Gospel according to
[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.480]   St. Matthew, chapter 7, verses 13 and 14.
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:17.620]   "Enter ye in at the straight gate, for wide is the gate, and broad is the way that leadeth
[00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:23.200]   to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat.
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:31.680]   Because straight is the gate, and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life, and few there
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.600]   be that find it."
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:43.560]   There is no charge perhaps which is brought quite so frequently against the Christian
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.700]   teaching, the Christian Gospel, the Christian way of life, and the individual Christian
[00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.740]   believer as the charge of narrowness.
[00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:59.440]   Many things are said about us as Christians, but I think this is one of the commonest of
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.440]   all.
[00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.680]   They say we are mistaken, that we are dull and foolish and so on, but I think that during
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.320]   this present century in particular, the favorite charge that has been brought against us is
[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.600]   this charge of narrowness.
[00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:21.680]   And this of course is the charge which is brought against us particularly by the kind
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.640]   of men who in his anxiety to show the breadth and the largeness of his own view, generally
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.540]   describes himself as being a man of the world.
[00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.760]   You see, he would never see how broad his outlook is.
[00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:42.800]   Nothing less than a world dimension is wide enough and big enough to measure his outlook,
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:50.920]   the man of the world, in contradistinction to this narrow, cramped, confined little person
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.440]   who calls himself a Christian.
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.960]   I think you'll agree that this is the favorite charge of the men of the world against the
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.760]   Christian, that because we are Christian we are of necessity narrow.
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.160]   But I'm afraid it's true to say that not only is that the favorite charge that is brought
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.960]   against us by the men of the world, I'm afraid it's true to say of many Christians that there
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:22.440]   is no charge of which they're so nervous and by which they're so frightened as this particular
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.440]   charge.
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.400]   They don't seem to mind that people say that they're wrong or muddle-headed or traditionalists
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.040]   and so on.
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.520]   Anything as long as it's not suggested that we're narrow.
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.680]   The average Christian seems to meet a rather peculiar detestation of this particular charge
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.680]   of narrowness.
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.840]   And of course, there are certain senses in which that's a very healthy and a very right
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.280]   and a very true reaction.
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.920]   God forbid that any of us should ever really become narrow.
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.680]   I mean by that, narrow in the sense that the Pharisees were narrow.
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:08.200]   Those legalists who would reduce the law and the grace of God to their petty little vetoes
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.480]   and prohibitions and restraints.
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.160]   God forbid I say that any of us should ever become legalists and reduce this glorious
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:27.200]   gospel of liberty into a mere number of prohibitions and foibles of our own in this way.
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.720]   But as I see things today, that's not our danger at all.
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.800]   Our danger, I feel, as modern Christians is really the exact opposite.
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:41.080]   And that is that in our fear and dread and horror of being called narrow, we should swing
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:48.880]   so far to the other extreme as in the end to be so wide and so broad and so large as
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:55.920]   just to lose our landmarks altogether and really to end by knowing not what the real
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.720]   meaning of the word Christian is.
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.360]   That seems to me to be the great danger.
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:07.440]   Everybody wants to claim a wide and a broad outlook, breadth of understanding, a charity
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.340]   and a tolerance that's prepared to include everything.
[00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.360]   That seems to me to be the greatest danger.
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:21.760]   Indeed, I sometimes put it like this, that I think that a very well-known story in Aesop's
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.640]   fables has a great deal to say to many a modern Christian.
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.800]   I'm referring to the well-known old story about the frog and the ox.
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.040]   Do you remember that story in Aesop's fables?
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:39.240]   The story is that one day there was a little frog in a field and there he was, but suddenly
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:45.160]   he happened to look up and he saw this enormous creature standing by his side, the ox.
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.040]   And as the frog looked at the ox, he felt very small.
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:54.960]   This creature was so big, so great, so wide, and he, the little frog, was so small and
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.700]   so narrow and so cramped.
[00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:02.840]   But from looking at the frog and admiring him, he began to be envious of him and then
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.720]   to feel he'd like to become like the ox.
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.160]   Why shouldn't he be big and great and broad also?
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:14.080]   So you remember the story goes on to tell us that the little frog began to puff himself
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:21.080]   up and to inflate himself, and he blew and blew and blew until at last he became so big,
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:26.520]   so great, and so wide, well, he just exploded and went out of existence.
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:32.320]   And that, unless I'm very greatly mistaken, is the precise thing that seems to have happened
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:39.040]   to the so-called faith of many a so-called Christian in this present century.
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:44.800]   And their desire to be considered broad-minded, what little faith they ever had, has long
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.840]   since exploded and has gone out of existence.
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.920]   But this not only applies to the individual.
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:59.640]   I believe the whole condition of the Christian church today is very largely due to this self-same
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:00.960]   thing.
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:08.280]   The Christian church, in her utter folly, during this present century, has been recognizing
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.760]   a new authority.
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:16.480]   And the new authority, of course, is the men of knowledge, the men of culture, and particularly
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:19.240]   the men of scientific knowledge.
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:27.880]   And the church has been at great pains to do everything she can to please this new authority.
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:31.400]   This man of learning must never be offended.
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:36.440]   And in order to please him and duplicate him, the church has been ready to take things out
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.400]   of the Bible.
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:43.440]   She rejects and throws out the whole of the first three chapters of Genesis, much of the
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:50.160]   other history, throws out all the miracles, throws out the virgin birth and incarnation,
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:55.160]   throws out the miracles of our Lord, throws out the atonement, throws out the literal
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.800]   physical resurrection.
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:03.760]   She'll throw out anything in order to make her message pleasing and acceptable to this
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:09.440]   new authority, the men of knowledge, the men of learning, the men of science.
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:14.520]   You see, in that way, the church—and I'm not exaggerating—the church has been prepared
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:23.000]   to trim and to clip and to change her message in order that it may fit and suit this new
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.400]   authority, the men of learning and of culture.
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:34.880]   But you know, my dear friends, in doing that, the church has departed very far indeed from
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:39.920]   the pattern and the example set for her by her Lord and Master.
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:45.320]   As I read the four Gospels, I never find the Lord Jesus Christ trimming and clipping and
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:48.800]   changing his Gospel in order to make it suit the people.
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:54.060]   I find him trimming and clipping and changing the people in order to make them fit into
[00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:56.000]   his Gospel.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:04.040]   And believe me, we shall see no revival, no new life in the church until we return
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:08.880]   to the royal manner and the royal pattern and example.
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:15.200]   My commission here tonight, as is the commission of every true preacher, ye servant of God,
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:21.800]   you are master proclaim and publish abroad his wonderful name, whether men like it or
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.960]   whether they dislike it.
[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:29.600]   This is the truth that is committed unto us, and whatever they may say, we must preach
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:34.280]   it without fear and with a holy boldness.
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:40.200]   Very well, I say all that in order that I may say just a word in passing to any Christian
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:45.020]   who may be in this congregation tonight and who is a little bit nervous about this charge
[00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:47.960]   of being called narrow.
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:53.400]   My dear friend, the next time one of these so-called men of the world comes to you and
[00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:58.520]   tells you that you're narrow-minded and narrow because you're a Christian, instead of apologizing,
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:03.560]   instead of trying to explain it away, instead of whimpering or crying or running away, just
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:09.840]   stand your ground, look at him straight in the eye and say to him, "Of course I'm narrow."
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:14.680]   And it would be a very much better thing for you and especially for your wife and children
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:21.460]   if you also became narrow and ceased the boast of a breadth and a largeness and a width which
[00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:28.560]   are nothing but an excuse for laxity and looseness and sin.
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:32.160]   Whatever else might happen, I can promise you this for certain, he wouldn't worry you
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:36.040]   quite so frequently in the future as he's tended to do in the past.
[00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:40.640]   However, that's an aside.
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:48.200]   What I'm really concerned to do tonight is this, is to consider this narrowness.
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:50.000]   Now this is a remarkable thing.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.160]   Have you ever noticed this?
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:10:00.400]   When our Lord Jesus Christ came to choose a name or a designation for his kingdom and
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:08.320]   for his way of life, he deliberately chose this word of which you and I tend to be so
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:09.320]   nervous.
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:11.760]   Had you ever thought of that?
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:16.840]   Here he was, he had the vocabulary of the whole universe at his disposal, and yet you
[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:25.520]   see when he comes to name his way of life, he deliberately calls it the narrow way.
[00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:29.000]   The thing that you and I are a little bit ashamed of, he boasts of.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:36.840]   He exalts in it, puts it on the flag of the kingdom, the straight gate, the narrow way.
[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:42.360]   He glories in the thing that so alarms and terrifies us.
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:43.360]   Why is this?
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.520]   Here's the question.
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:53.120]   Why did our Lord deliberately choose to call his way of life the narrow way?
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:55.880]   You know, he never did anything by accident.
[00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:58.480]   He never did anything haphazardly.
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:04.320]   And when he calls his way of life the narrow way, he has very good reasons for doing so.
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:05.880]   What are they?
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:07.480]   Why should we call it the narrow way?
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:09.120]   Why should we walk on it?
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:13.520]   Why should we glory and exalt in this narrowness?
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:18.480]   Or to put my question differently, in what respects is it true to say of the Christian
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:22.920]   way of life that it is indeed the narrow way?
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:25.640]   Let me answer the question.
[00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:33.120]   The first respect in which this way of life is narrow is that it deliberately confines
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:39.880]   even the very field of its considerations to one subject.
[00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:42.320]   Now this is a remarkable thing.
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:47.160]   The gospel starts by being narrow.
[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:51.800]   It narrows down the very things it's even going to consider.
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:56.240]   Now this is of course a very surprising thing, and a very surprising thing particularly in
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:58.040]   this modern age.
[00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:01.680]   We are living of course in the age of encyclopedias, aren't we?
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:06.760]   And what you get in an encyclopedia, well, what you get in an encyclopedia is a little
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:10.600]   bit of knowledge about many, many subjects.
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.480]   That's the characteristic of this age.
[00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:14.640]   We want to know a little bit about everything.
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:17.280]   We've got a tabloid mentality.
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:20.720]   Little bit of information about many things.
[00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:24.480]   That's the exact opposite of what we have here.
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:29.840]   Take this book, the Bible, this great old book of 66 other books written at different
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:34.600]   times by different people in different circumstances and so on.
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:39.760]   And in this book of course there is a great deal about creation.
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:46.360]   There's a great deal about births and marriages and deaths and wars.
[00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:48.400]   Quite a great variety of subjects.
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.720]   History and many, many other subjects.
[00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:54.600]   And yet, this book is not an encyclopedia.
[00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:55.600]   What is it?
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:59.160]   Oh, it's a very specialized book.
[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:01.840]   It's the manual of the soul.
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:10.400]   This book has only got one theme, and that one theme is God and man, or man in his relationship
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:11.480]   to God.
[00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:16.200]   It's the one theme of the Bible from beginning to end.
[00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:21.840]   Man and his relationship to the eternal God.
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:25.160]   It's not a book that tells you a little bit about many things.
[00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:29.480]   It's a book that tells you everything about that one theme.
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:34.280]   It keeps itself to this one great central theme.
[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:36.360]   It's a specialist book.
[00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:39.760]   And what is true of the book is true of the master of the book.
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:45.280]   If ever there was a specialist in this world, it was the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:47.280]   Look at the things he might have done.
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:50.520]   Look at the ability, the knowledge at his command.
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:57.880]   Yet you know he deliberately keeps himself to his one theme, and it was this one theme,
[00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:05.080]   the soul of man and its relationship to the everlasting God.
[00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:07.880]   Had you ever noticed that as you've read the four gospels?
[00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:12.040]   You know there is a sense in which it's true to say that the Lord Jesus Christ had only
[00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:17.060]   one sermon, and he went on preaching that one sermon for three years.
[00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:22.120]   He varied his illustrations, but there was only one point, and there was only one essential
[00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:23.120]   sermon.
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:28.560]   And it was about this whole question of man's soul in its relationship to God.
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:32.000]   Let me illustrate what I mean.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.520]   There is our Lord one afternoon, obviously in the country with his followers, and he
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:42.120]   sees a farmer sowing the seed into the ground.
[00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:46.920]   Now it's quite clear that our Lord knew a good deal about agriculture and was interested
[00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:51.800]   in it, but the sight of that farmer didn't lead our Lord, you know, to give a lecture
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:52.800]   on agriculture.
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:56.600]   Our Lord never lectured, he always preached.
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:57.600]   What does he say?
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.080]   Well, this is how he puts it.
[00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:02.680]   You see that farmer, he says, he's sowing seed into the ground.
[00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:05.040]   Yes, but incidentally he's doing another thing.
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:07.280]   He's testing the ground.
[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:12.880]   There's only one type of seed, but there are many types of ground, and the ground is
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:18.400]   going to be judged by its response and its reaction to the seed that that farmer is sowing
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:19.400]   into it.
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:22.320]   He said, you know, I'm like that farmer.
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:23.640]   What is my preaching?
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:27.660]   It's nothing but the sowing of the word of life.
[00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:31.240]   And he said, you know, as I'm preaching to you, I'm testing you.
[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:38.040]   You will be judged in eternity by your response to my preaching, to the words that I'm speaking
[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:39.040]   to you.
[00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:41.000]   I'm exactly like that farmer.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:47.360]   Take heed how he hear, he that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
[00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:49.680]   That's how he uses it.
[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:54.840]   Then you remember on another occasion, he's out in the country again, but this time they're
[00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:57.760]   standing opposite an orchard.
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:02.920]   And there are the trees in the orchard, various types bearing various kinds of fruit.
[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:08.160]   And our Lord looks at the orchard, and again he's obviously interested in horticulture.
[00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:11.720]   But the sight of the orchard doesn't make him give an address on horticulture, no, no.
[00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:14.640]   He sees another illustration for the one point.
[00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:17.080]   He says, look at those trees.
[00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:19.040]   How do you judge a tree?
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:22.240]   Well you judge a tree by the fruit that it bears.
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:25.480]   It may be good or bad.
[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:31.080]   He said, had you good people realized that you were like those trees, and that in this
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:37.040]   world you're bearing fruit, and it can be good or bad, and by their fruits you shall
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:38.040]   know them?
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:44.560]   You're going to be judged in eternity by the fruits that you bear in this life.
[00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:49.320]   You see, it's exactly the same point, but illustrated in a different way.
[00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:52.360]   And then another, let me give you one final illustration of this.
[00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:56.280]   He's in the country again, and he looks at the birds flying in the air, and the flowers,
[00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:58.480]   the lilies of the field.
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:03.800]   Does that send him home to write poems about flowers, or to try to paint birds?
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:05.440]   Of course it doesn't.
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:08.460]   Our Lord was not interested in art for art's sake.
[00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:12.080]   He just sees another illustration for the same point.
[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:18.520]   If God so clothed the lily, if God is so interested in the birds of the air, how much greater
[00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:23.760]   is his interest in you, you everlasting souls?
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:31.160]   You see, all the vast knowledge that he had and commended, he simply uses to illustrate
[00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:38.600]   and to bring out the point, this one thing that matters in this world, the soul of man,
[00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:40.700]   and its relationship to God.
[00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:46.080]   Not a word of politics, not a word of protest against the Roman authorities that had conquered
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:54.080]   them, no, no, the one theme, he narrows it down to this, the soul of man.
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:57.320]   He sums it up in a tremendous word.
[00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:04.920]   What shall it profit a man, though he gained the whole world of wealth and knowledge and
[00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:11.040]   everything, and lose his own soul?
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:16.200]   Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.880]   You see, this is the one thing he's interested in.
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:22.720]   But you know, he even narrows that down.
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:27.600]   That's very narrow, as judged by encyclopedias and the modern mentality, but our Lord even
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:29.480]   narrows that down.
[00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:35.880]   In other words, he was not only interested in the soul as an idea and as a concept, he
[00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:40.800]   was interested in the individual soul, in the personal soul.
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:42.160]   He narrows it down.
[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:46.480]   And that, of course, was the big difference between our Lord's interest in the soul and
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:50.800]   that of the Greek philosophers, who had lived and had died before he ever came into the
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:51.800]   world.
[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:57.000]   The Greek philosophers were interested in the soul, yes, but always as an idea, as a
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.920]   thought, as some vague concept.
[00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:01.960]   That wasn't our Lord's interest.
[00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:07.520]   He was interested in the personal soul, the individual soul, your soul, my soul.
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:13.200]   And of course, that's why many a modern man dislikes this gospel so intensely.
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:16.840]   He says, "All right, when you were talking about the soul, I was interested and I was
[00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:19.120]   in agreement, but now you're becoming personal.
[00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:20.800]   You're bringing it down to me.
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:22.120]   You're talking about me.
[00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:23.120]   This is intolerable.
[00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:24.120]   This is personal."
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:31.520]   Exactly like one of the prime ministers in Great Britain last century, Lord Melbourne,
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:35.320]   who happened to be prime minister when Queen Victoria came to the throne.
[00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:41.120]   He was, of course, a member of the Church of England, a formalist.
[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:48.720]   He went to church now and again, you know, paid this lip service, supposed Christian.
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:52.040]   And he betrayed himself on one occasion when he put it like this.
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:57.440]   He said, "Things are coming to a pretty pass if religion's going to start being personal."
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:03.440]   See, religion is all right when you've got some great state occasion, when there's a
[00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:10.560]   coronation or a royal death or the funeral of a president or some great ceremonial occasion.
[00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:12.400]   Ah, religion then is very good.
[00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:15.360]   It adds a little bit of dignity and ceremonial.
[00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:21.080]   But if religion's going to interfere in my personal life and living, it becomes intolerable.
[00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:22.640]   Must be personal.
[00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:27.880]   Ah, but the Lord Jesus Christ was always personal.
[00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:30.280]   He was intensely personal.
[00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:34.480]   Let me give you but one illustration to prove my point.
[00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:40.760]   You get it in the fourth chapter of the Gospel according to St. John, in the famous story
[00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:44.160]   of our Lord's meeting with the so-called Woman of Samaria.
[00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:45.840]   You remember the story.
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:51.420]   One afternoon he was too tired to go with the disciples to the neighboring city to buy provisions.
[00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:55.440]   He just sat down by the side of the well to have a rest.
[00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:59.920]   Scarcely had he done so when this woman came to draw water from the well.
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:03.200]   And the moment she came, they began to have a talk and a discussion.
[00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:04.200]   What was it about?
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:06.520]   Well, it was about religion.
[00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:08.840]   A discussion on religion.
[00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:09.840]   What were the topics?
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:10.840]   Here they were.
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:11.840]   Who did this well belong to?
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:14.200]   The Jews or the Samaritans?
[00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:15.200]   Another question.
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:16.200]   Where should you worship?
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:17.200]   In this mountain?
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:22.300]   Or were the Jews right in saying you could only worship in the temple in Jerusalem?
[00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:23.620]   And on she went.
[00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:26.700]   And she was enjoying the argument to her heart's content.
[00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:32.180]   Obviously an able woman, clever, subtle at the art of repartee, and she was enjoying
[00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:35.100]   this immensely.
[00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:40.540]   When our Lord did something that no modern gentleman would ever dream of doing, he became
[00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:41.540]   personal.
[00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:47.060]   And she becoming personal in an argument about religion.
[00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:48.500]   But he did.
[00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:53.300]   He suddenly turned to this woman and said, "Woman, go fetch thy husband and come hither."
[00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:59.740]   And the woman said, "Sir, I have no husband."
[00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:04.500]   And he said, "Yes, in that you say I have no husband, thou say'st the truth.
[00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:10.320]   For thou hast had five husbands, and he whom thou now hast is not thine husband."
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:16.020]   In other words, he revealed that he knew all about the life of sin and of adultery that
[00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:18.300]   she was living at that very moment.
[00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:22.140]   In other words, he said to her, "My dear good woman, you were talking cleverly and
[00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:27.180]   glibly and you are giving your opinion on God and heaven and hell and worship and all
[00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:29.380]   these matters of religion.
[00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:32.060]   And in the meantime, look at your own life.
[00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:33.940]   You have no right to an opinion.
[00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:39.300]   Put yourself right first, and then perhaps you may have a right to express your opinion.
[00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:40.300]   Start with yourself."
[00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:44.020]   That was our Lord's method.
[00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:46.540]   But of course to the modern man this is hateful.
[00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:47.540]   This is abominable.
[00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:50.940]   Oh, of course, discussion on religion.
[00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:53.380]   That's always good, isn't it?
[00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:54.700]   There's nothing else to talk about.
[00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:56.820]   Always have a discussion about religion.
[00:22:56.820 --> 00:23:01.620]   And we give our opinions about God and what God ought to be doing and what we think and
[00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:03.220]   this and that.
[00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:10.100]   But in the meantime, we're neglecting our own life and living and sinning and unworthy.
[00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:15.140]   Can't even control ourselves, but we'll express our opinion on the cosmos and on the
[00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:18.300]   mind of God.
[00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:22.180]   But our Lord Jesus Christ won't allow us to do that.
[00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:24.820]   He's not interested in our opinions.
[00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:28.460]   Our opinions are utterly irrelevant.
[00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:35.700]   The one thing he tells you to be concerned about is this, is your own soul, your relationship
[00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:38.020]   to God.
[00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:41.580]   And it's something which is intensely personal.
[00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:45.820]   You see, he talks about entering into a straight gate.
[00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:49.660]   And I always think that this straight gate is not like we used to have it on the pictures
[00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:52.140]   that the old people used to hang on their walls.
[00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:55.900]   I think this straight gate was a turnstile.
[00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:58.260]   And you know the point about a turnstile, don't you?
[00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:01.300]   It only admits one person at a time.
[00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:03.620]   You can't go two of you together into a turnstile.
[00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:06.780]   Husband and wife can't go together.
[00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:09.260]   Father and mother can't go together.
[00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:13.100]   Parents and children into the turnstile one by one.
[00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:15.140]   That's the straight gate.
[00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:16.700]   You and God.
[00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:20.500]   Your parents may have been the most saintly people that Pensacola has ever known.
[00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:22.780]   That doesn't save you.
[00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:28.660]   Every one of us has got to come to a private, personal, individual meeting with God.
[00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:32.020]   We can't ride into heaven on the back of saintly forebears.
[00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:37.700]   We can't be saved in nations or churches or towns or districts or communities.
[00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:42.260]   Every one of us has to come alone, face to face with God.
[00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:43.540]   Personal.
[00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:47.580]   He narrows it down to this.
[00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:53.780]   The eyes of the fool, says the Old Testament word, are on the ends of the earth.
[00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:58.260]   And people are talking tonight about the war in Vietnam and this problem and the other
[00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:02.420]   and the church is talking about all these things and people are saying God ought to
[00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:03.420]   do this and that.
[00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:07.620]   My dear friend, those are not the questions.
[00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:12.060]   The question is, do you know God?
[00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:17.020]   What is your personal relationship to God?
[00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:26.940]   He invites us to come back onto our own doorsteps and to face God individually and alone.
[00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:28.780]   He narrows it down to that.
[00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:33.500]   But then, having done even that, he narrows it still further.
[00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:38.780]   And having said that it is a very intensely personal matter, he then goes on to insist
[00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:41.820]   upon dictating into the way in which we live.
[00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:46.860]   And that, of course, was the great theme of this Sermon on the Mount, as we call it, of
[00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:52.060]   which my text tonight is the beginning of a kind of epilogue.
[00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:54.380]   He dictates, I say, the way in which we live.
[00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:56.220]   Ah, yes, says the modern man.
[00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:57.820]   That's why I hate it.
[00:25:57.820 --> 00:25:58.820]   You are gospel.
[00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:01.420]   It's so narrow.
[00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:04.340]   Tells me what I mustn't do and tells me what I must do.
[00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:07.020]   Interferes with my liberty as a man.
[00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:08.460]   It's impossibly narrow.
[00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:09.460]   It's too cramped.
[00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:10.460]   It's too confined.
[00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:12.660]   Give me something big and great.
[00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:15.100]   Give me a large view.
[00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:21.300]   They hate this ethical emphasis of the Scriptures and especially of the gospel.
[00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:24.420]   Well, whether we like it or not, this is a fact.
[00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:26.340]   Our Lord does do this.
[00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:29.860]   He dictates the way in which we live, both negatively and positively.
[00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:35.700]   Negatively, it's summed up perfectly for us, especially in the second half of the Ten Commandments.
[00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:39.580]   Here is how the gospel tells us we are to live.
[00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:46.780]   Thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not commit adultery, thou shalt
[00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:53.260]   not take, thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor, thou shalt not covet
[00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:59.620]   thy neighbor's wife or his ox or his ass or his servant or anything else.
[00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:03.740]   That's the negative aspect of this ethical teaching of the Scriptures.
[00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:09.580]   "Oh," says the modern man, "and I object to this, these prohibitions, these vitas."
[00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:11.540]   All right, I agree with you.
[00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:12.540]   It's narrow.
[00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:14.980]   But had you ever thought of this?
[00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:20.940]   If only everybody in the world tonight were as narrow as this gospel would have us be,
[00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:27.900]   there'd be no war in Vietnam, there'd be no iron curtains, there'd be no drunkenness,
[00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:33.340]   there'd be no infidelity and separations and divorces, there'd be no heartbreak amongst
[00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:37.420]   little children and all the suffering of the world.
[00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:42.100]   If only everybody in the world tonight lived according to the Ten Commandments and the
[00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:47.300]   negative aspects of the Sermon on the Mount, the world would be paradise.
[00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:49.700]   The problems would vanish.
[00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:56.260]   And therein we see the folly of this objection to the narrowness of the gospel.
[00:27:56.260 --> 00:28:01.420]   If you like, it is the narrowness that is characteristic of God himself, for we are
[00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:07.460]   told that God is the Father of lights with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of
[00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:08.460]   turning.
[00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:11.540]   "God," says Paul to Titus, "who cannot lie."
[00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:17.300]   "God," says James, "who cannot be tempted and neither tempteth any men.
[00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:25.660]   God, as it were, hemmed in by his own utter, absolute holiness, and sin and evil are impossible
[00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:27.340]   to him."
[00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:35.780]   So, that we all begin to seek and to covet this narrowness, instead of bursting of a
[00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:43.180]   breadth and a width and a largeness of outlook that leads to moral chaos and political and
[00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:51.780]   social and international chaos and the horrors that we are so aware of in our modern world.
[00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:55.260]   That's the negative narrowness of the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:57.260]   But look at the positive narrowness.
[00:28:57.260 --> 00:28:58.260]   It's even more wonderful.
[00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:05.220]   "Enter ye in at the straight gate," he says, "come unto the narrow way."
[00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:06.220]   What's he saying?
[00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:09.060]   Well, I think he's saying something like this.
[00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:12.020]   You see, this is a part of the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:15.460]   He's saying, in effect, "Come with me to the mountaintop."
[00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:23.740]   "Don't be content," he says, "to live life anyhow, somehow, on the dull plains of life."
[00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:25.540]   Anybody can do that.
[00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:28.620]   "Come up to the heights."
[00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:35.060]   In other words, the narrowness that I find here is what we may well call the narrowness
[00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:36.060]   of circles.
[00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:39.100]   Have you ever thought of this?
[00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:43.620]   The higher up you go in any circle, the fewer the people you find in it.
[00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:46.460]   Take a social circle.
[00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:53.500]   We all belong to society in general, but the number of people who are intimate with the
[00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:57.700]   president is much smaller.
[00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:02.580]   Any social scale, the higher you go, the fewer the people you'll find in it.
[00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:04.900]   It's true of every profession.
[00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:09.600]   The higher you go in any profession or walk of life, the fewer will be the competitors
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:11.580]   that are in it.
[00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:17.380]   Whether it's singing, whether it's art, whether it's music, whatever it is, the higher the
[00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:21.540]   circle of achievement, the fewer the people you'll find in it.
[00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:23.500]   That's the invitation that our Lord is giving.
[00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:25.900]   "Come," he says, "up to the heights.
[00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:30.580]   Don't be content just to live anyhow, somehow, just to shuffle through this world and through
[00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:31.580]   life.
[00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:33.780]   Come after me," he says, "scale the heights.
[00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:38.180]   Let's ascend to the topmost summit of this mountain, and here it is.
[00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:43.660]   Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.
[00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:45.340]   Come to the top of the mountain.
[00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:47.300]   Don't live as any fool can live.
[00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:53.220]   It's easy to float out when the tide is going out or to float downstream.
[00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:55.380]   It's easy to get drunk and to go wrong.
[00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:56.380]   Any fool can do it.
[00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:57.380]   Every fool is doing it.
[00:30:57.380 --> 00:30:58.380]   Don't do that," he says.
[00:30:58.380 --> 00:30:59.380]   "Be exceptional.
[00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:00.380]   Be great.
[00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:03.260]   Be like God.
[00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:08.500]   Come to the topmost circle, which includes God himself.
[00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:15.140]   Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect."
[00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:16.700]   That's the narrowness.
[00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:20.060]   And that brings me to my last point.
[00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:27.180]   The narrowness of the gospel is finally seen in this, that having said all that, our Lord
[00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:36.780]   then goes on to say this, that salvation and deliverance from our estranged position from
[00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:44.780]   God and under the condemnation of God and his holy law, that salvation is only possible
[00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:49.780]   for us through one person.
[00:31:49.780 --> 00:32:01.660]   And he even narrows that, that one person crucified, Jesus Christ and him crucified.
[00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:06.540]   "Yes," says the modern man, "that's exactly why I've left the church.
[00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:08.860]   I've got no interest in it whatsoever.
[00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:10.780]   You narrow Christians.
[00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:17.060]   You don't know anything about Confucius and Buddha and Mohammed and the great Greek philosophers.
[00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:22.340]   You keep yourself to one book and just one person and you say it's Jesus Christ alone
[00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:26.940]   and you're not interested in wide thinking and broad outlooks.
[00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:32.440]   And then you say that I've got to believe that that one person could die a death to
[00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:41.140]   atone for the sin of the whole world, propitiation for the sin of the whole world."
[00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:43.220]   He says it's immoral, it's impossible.
[00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:44.620]   I can't go there.
[00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:45.620]   This is wrong.
[00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:47.260]   This is ridiculous.
[00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:52.340]   One dying for another, one being punished as innocent and the others being said it's wrong,
[00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:53.340]   it's unethical.
[00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:54.900]   They reject the cross.
[00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:57.620]   They pour their scorn and derision upon it.
[00:32:57.620 --> 00:33:02.180]   Jesus Christ alone and his death in particular.
[00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:04.100]   What are we to say to such a man?
[00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:07.580]   Well, we don't argue with him.
[00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:10.780]   The gospel doesn't argue.
[00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:14.140]   It's more of a challenge than an argument.
[00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:15.140]   It's a proclamation.
[00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:22.940]   And what the gospel says to such a man is this, my dear friend, if you can find God
[00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:32.140]   and know him without going via Jesus Christ and him crucified, good luck to you.
[00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:37.500]   If you can live a successful and a worthy life in a world like this without getting
[00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:43.940]   any help from him, I have nothing to do but to congratulate you, to admire you, and to
[00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:46.580]   envy you.
[00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:55.340]   If you can arrive on your deathbed or stand over an open grave without a fear or a terror
[00:33:55.340 --> 00:34:01.060]   or a hesitation or a doubt and feel you're ready to stand before the everlasting and
[00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:10.300]   eternal God in judgment, again I can but say to you, carry on.
[00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:23.620]   But if ever you feel you're lost and forlorn, if ever you feel that you're a miserable failure,
[00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:30.300]   if ever you realize that you don't know God and are men enough to confess it, if ever
[00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:34.940]   you realize you're afraid of death and not ready to meet it, and that if you did stand
[00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:39.180]   before God you'd have nothing to say, if ever it all comes back to you and you're stripped
[00:34:39.180 --> 00:34:44.420]   naked and you've got nothing and you see yourself in utter hopelessness and desperation and
[00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:56.300]   a final despair, turn back to him, the Christ you've rejected and whose voice you've spurned,
[00:34:56.300 --> 00:35:04.980]   the Christ of the cross, and you'll find him still there and he won't refuse you.
[00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:10.860]   He'll be ready to receive you still, though you make of him the last resort of a desperate
[00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:12.620]   sinner.
[00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:14.620]   That's the message.
[00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:20.980]   When everything else has failed you, you turn to him, the Christ of the cross, the Christ
[00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:27.300]   of Calvary, the one through whom God was reconciling the world unto himself.
[00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:29.300]   He will receive you.
[00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:34.820]   Take away your fears, give you the assurance that he's borne your punishment.
[00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:39.940]   Will reconcile you and introduce you to God and open the gate into heaven.
[00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:42.540]   That is the narrowness of the gospel.
[00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:45.140]   But for me to close, let me put it to you like this.
[00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:52.620]   Have you ever noticed, I wonder, that the earthly life and course of our blessed Lord
[00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:57.820]   himself is the most perfect commentary on my text tonight?
[00:35:57.820 --> 00:35:59.700]   Sure it is.
[00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:05.820]   Straight is the gate, narrow is the way, but it leadeth unto life.
[00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:07.860]   Look at it like this.
[00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:09.660]   Take his coming into this world.
[00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:13.140]   Take his birth in Bethlehem.
[00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:17.460]   Was there ever such straightening?
[00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:20.060]   Straight is the gate, it means narrow.
[00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:22.500]   Was there ever such a narrowing?
[00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:28.340]   Here he is, the eternal son of God, co-equal, co-eternal with his father.
[00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:32.540]   But he's born, he comes as a helpless babe.
[00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:38.480]   Oh, the narrowing, the straightening that took place at Bethlehem.
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:40.840]   But watch him as he goes along.
[00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:46.420]   See him in his life, see him especially setting out in his earthly ministry.
[00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:51.860]   Keep your eye on the Pharisees and scribes and Sadducees and the doctors of the law.
[00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:56.180]   Watch them gradually spreading around him and gradually drawing it in.
[00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:59.900]   The questions, the trick, trap questions they put to him.
[00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:01.860]   They're narrowing him down.
[00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:05.580]   Straight is the gate, narrow is the way.
[00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:11.060]   Come along, look at him in a garden called Gethsemane.
[00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:15.100]   Remember this is the one who's created the whole universe.
[00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:17.300]   They have confined him now to a garden.
[00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:19.460]   There are soldiers around the garden.
[00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:22.740]   He's allowed to walk up and down the garden, but he can't go outside.
[00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:26.060]   The soldiers, straight is the gate, narrow is the way.
[00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:28.900]   They're narrowing him down, they're closing in on him.
[00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:33.500]   And indeed in a few hours, look at him, he's now in a police court with a soldier on one
[00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:35.220]   side, a soldier on the other.
[00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:38.660]   He can't walk backwards and forwards now, he could just now in the garden.
[00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:39.660]   He can't now.
[00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:46.340]   He's there, he can move his hands and his legs if he chooses, but he can't move.
[00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:49.780]   They've narrowed him down, the soldiers are hemming him in.
[00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:52.460]   What am I talking about?
[00:37:52.460 --> 00:38:02.700]   Look at him on that cross, the creator of the world, the Lord of life, nailed to a tree.
[00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:04.460]   Can't move hands nor feet.
[00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:07.140]   They fixed him, they brought him down to this.
[00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:12.300]   He's immovable, crucified, nailed to the tree.
[00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:15.740]   Straight is the gate, narrow is the way, and that's what it leads to.
[00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:17.180]   And he died.
[00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:21.060]   They take down his body and they put it into a grave.
[00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:22.060]   Look into that grave.
[00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:24.740]   Don't the very sides seem to collapse?
[00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:27.220]   It's the end.
[00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:30.900]   Straight is the gate, narrow is the way.
[00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:39.380]   Bethlehem, enemies, persecutions, trials, agony, sweating blood in the garden, trial,
[00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:44.660]   damnation, crucifixion, death, burial, grave.
[00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:49.220]   Straight is the gate, narrow is the way, and it leads to the grave.
[00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:54.500]   But thank God my text doesn't stop there.
[00:38:54.500 --> 00:39:04.380]   Straight is the gate, narrow is the way, but it leadeth unto life.
[00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:06.380]   So it does.
[00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:18.540]   Bethlehem, enemies, opposition, trial, reviling, agony and sweat, trial, condemnation, crucifixion,
[00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:22.100]   death, burial, grave.
[00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:30.780]   But he burst asunder the bands of death, arose triumphant o'er the grave, bringing life and
[00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:35.180]   immortality to light through his gospel.
[00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:45.540]   Here it is, my dear friends, all in this marvelous picture of his coming and his going.
[00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:52.580]   The one thing that matters is that we should all know of a surety that we've entered this
[00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:59.700]   straight gate and that we are this moment on the narrow way.
[00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:06.660]   All the madness of the world, all the narrowness, it's too correct, impossible.
[00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:07.660]   And they go the other way.
[00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:09.780]   And look what he says about the other way.
[00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:14.180]   Wide is the gate, broad is the way.
[00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:23.900]   Look at them, the thousands, drinking, dancing, singing, indulging sex, taking their drugs,
[00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:24.900]   spitting on the sanctities.
[00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:27.980]   Life, they say, marvelous.
[00:40:27.980 --> 00:40:28.980]   Look at the crowd.
[00:40:28.980 --> 00:40:29.980]   Yes, look at the crowd.
[00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:40.340]   The vital question to ask about a way is this, is not so much as to its width, but as to
[00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:43.420]   the place to which it leads you.
[00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:48.980]   Wide is the gate and broad is the way, but where does it lead to?
[00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:49.980]   Destruction?
[00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:52.940]   It leads us to destruction.
[00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:57.220]   It's already the destruction of everything that is best in human nature.
[00:40:57.220 --> 00:41:02.660]   Look at the violence these poor young people are doing to all their highest and best qualities.
[00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:09.220]   The first qualities to suffer from drink and drugs are always the higher centers, the best
[00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:15.580]   qualities, sensitivity, refinement, understanding, chastity, purity.
[00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:22.740]   These are the things that go first and it ends in destruction.
[00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:26.140]   The other way seems very narrow at the beginning, doesn't it?
[00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:34.100]   There are not many people on it, but consider, says our Lord, where it's going to bring you.
[00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:35.820]   Straight is the gate.
[00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:40.060]   You seem at first to be having to give up things to become a Christian and that's the
[00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:42.140]   biggest follies to think that.
[00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:49.060]   It appears to be that because we were blinded by sin, but actually you enter in at the straight
[00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:54.020]   gate, you begin to walk on the narrow way and you see him ahead of you and he's got
[00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:58.980]   everything, all the treasures of God's wisdom and riches and grace are in him.
[00:41:58.980 --> 00:41:59.980]   He gives you everything.
[00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:02.440]   The very hairs of your head become all numbered.
[00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:04.900]   He showers his grace upon you.
[00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:07.880]   There's nothing that you can ever need but that he'll give it to you.
[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:12.120]   With the apostle Paul you will be able to say, "I have learned in whatsoever state I
[00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:13.820]   am therein to be content.
[00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:16.620]   I know both how to be at rest and how to abound.
[00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:22.540]   I can do all things in Christ which strengthens me, the companion of Christ and of the saints."
[00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:24.660]   And you go on and on.
[00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:34.900]   Straight is the gate and narrow is the way, but it'll lead him unto life, life which is
[00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:47.380]   life indeed, life more abundant, the life of God, the life of eternal bliss.
[00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:52.260]   My dear friend, where are you?
[00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:58.420]   You're on one or the other of these two ways.
[00:42:58.420 --> 00:43:05.860]   If you're not certain that you're on this narrow way, here is invitation tonight.
[00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:11.380]   Enter in just as you are into the straight gate.
[00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:16.100]   Come onto the narrow way.
[00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:19.660]   Follow me.
[00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:20.660]   Let us pray.
[00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:30.380]   Oh Lord, our God, we thank thee for this glorious gospel.
[00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:34.140]   We thank thee that it is as it is.
[00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:37.140]   We thank thee that it is not of human invention.
[00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:43.300]   We thank thee that it is so essentially different from everything else in the world.
[00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:52.700]   Lord, we bless thy name for this, for its holiness, its purity, its cleanliness, for
[00:43:52.700 --> 00:44:01.140]   everything in it that makes us realize the dignity of manhood and of womanhood and restores
[00:44:01.140 --> 00:44:12.540]   to us in its original manner the image that has become so marred in us all by nature.
[00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:21.420]   Son of Adam and children of the fall, oh Lord, have mercy and have pity upon all who, controlled
[00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:27.980]   in their thinking by this foolish mind of the world, regard such a glorious gospel as
[00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:31.060]   narrow.
[00:44:31.060 --> 00:44:40.260]   Lord enable them to see that this is life which is life indeed, life more abundant,
[00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:43.820]   life, glorious life.
[00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:45.860]   Lord open the eyes of the blind.
[00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:53.340]   Hear us in the name of thy dear Son, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:54.340]   Amen.
[00:44:54.340 --> 00:44:58.620]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
