[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960]   All right, let's do some technology questions.
[00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.160]   Now I said questions,
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.240]   but it's probably more accurate to say question
[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.600]   because I only have one technology question.
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.200]   I only selected one because it's big and open-ended.
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.440]   It comes from Miranda.
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.400]   And she asked, what are your thoughts in general
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.400]   about AI machine learning and where technology is headed?
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.520]   So we haven't done a good open-ended technology question
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.360]   in a while.
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:37.540]   Well, Miranda, I'll tell you where the focus seems to be,
[00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.840]   at least in popular online conversation in the media,
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.840]   there's a lot of focus on crypto, social media, and AI.
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:52.000]   Those seem to be big topics.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.500]   So let's go through those briefly one by one.
[00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.300]   All right, so let's talk about crypto.
[00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.760]   As you may have heard me talk about before,
[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.300]   my personal belief is that the hype around crypto
[00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.160]   is a little bit excessive.
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:11.780]   So there's a political element to crypto
[00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.660]   that's based around trust and power and control.
[00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.860]   This idea that these distributed ledgers
[00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.240]   implemented by cryptographic protocols,
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.700]   that these distributed ledgers
[00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.420]   are not controlled by a single government
[00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.020]   or controlled by a single company.
[00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.980]   And therefore there can be coordination
[00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.940]   and information sharing on the internet
[00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.460]   that is not beholden to the censorious efforts
[00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.220]   of individual organizations or countries.
[00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.780]   So there's a crypto,
[00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.840]   a sort of techno libertarian political argument
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.020]   for what you gain from this decentralization.
[00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.420]   I don't think most people care about that.
[00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.100]   I don't think, I think it's important for certain people
[00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.180]   who think a lot about this, but for the average consumer,
[00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.460]   they don't care about that, right?
[00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.880]   So that by itself is not that strong.
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.780]   But if you take out the techno libertarian
[00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.340]   political justification
[00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.340]   for crypto based ledger technologies,
[00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.720]   there's not something else there
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:07.780]   that we don't already know how to do
[00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.020]   much better and much faster.
[00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.100]   We know how to have consistent distributed data stores.
[00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.300]   This is what distributed databases do.
[00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.480]   This is easy to implement.
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.820]   So it's not like there's a new technological capability
[00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.580]   that is introduced by crypto based blockchains.
[00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.300]   It's just, there's a decentralization that comes with it.
[00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.980]   And the value of that is largely political,
[00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.100]   not technological.
[00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.500]   So again, I think most consumers don't care.
[00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.880]   They don't really care whether the data
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.880]   for this app they're using is stored in the cloud somewhere
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.060]   in just a virtualized SQL database system,
[00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.860]   or if it's implemented by an Ethereum blockchain.
[00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:49.900]   It looks the same to them,
[00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.260]   and they don't really care about
[00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.580]   which way this is being implemented.
[00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:54.820]   Now for a while, there was an argument
[00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.700]   about the particular aspect of crypto.
[00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.100]   That is the currency aspect.
[00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.100]   So all of these ledgers, or not all of them,
[00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.140]   but open ledgers are almost all based on
[00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.220]   there being some sort of underlying currency.
[00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.580]   And there's some thought that a currency
[00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:08.700]   not controlled by governments,
[00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.180]   it was critical and it was going to be a worldwide currency.
[00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.900]   That's sort of fallen flat.
[00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.820]   The currencies didn't really take over from fiat money.
[00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:19.900]   So you get rid of that.
[00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.820]   Again, there's nothing sexy about what's being,
[00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.100]   the functionality implemented by these crypto tools.
[00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.060]   It's really just the political reality
[00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.220]   that no one controls it.
[00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.340]   And I, again, don't think enough people care about that
[00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.620]   for this to be a complete game changer.
[00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.420]   Could be wrong about this.
[00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.100]   And Jason Horowitz would probably say
[00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.440]   that firm would not be happy with my interpretation,
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.100]   but there you go.
[00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.380]   All right, social media.
[00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.700]   That's the other thing that seems to be really
[00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.140]   the focus of a lot of techno criticism
[00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.500]   and conversation right now.
[00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.060]   Longtime listeners know that I believe that social media
[00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.140]   as we know it, that is this age of a small number
[00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.140]   of massive platform monopolies
[00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.900]   that everyone is culturally pressured into using.
[00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.020]   We are in the twilight of that moment.
[00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.460]   That moment is passing.
[00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:12.300]   This is the standard oil,
[00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.060]   Pennsylvania Central Railroad,
[00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.820]   robber baron era of the social internet era.
[00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.820]   And I think it is passing.
[00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.700]   I've talked about this before,
[00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.260]   so I won't go into too much detail,
[00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.380]   but basically at the core of my thought is
[00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.340]   one of the things that used to capture people
[00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.900]   in the social media was network effects.
[00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.860]   People were using social media platforms
[00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.560]   to connect to people they know.
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.440]   Therefore for a platform to be useful,
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.460]   it has to include among its members,
[00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.120]   all the people that you know or might wanna connect to.
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.740]   That is a huge advantage once you get there first,
[00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.380]   because another social media platform
[00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.100]   will have a hard time competing
[00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.860]   because until they can get your cousin and your aunt
[00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.980]   and your six friends from high school onto their service,
[00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.960]   it will be lesser than an existing service like Facebook.
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.560]   This is called network effects.
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.180]   There's a sort of trivial mathematical law here
[00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.380]   that says in a network,
[00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.860]   it's the value grows with the square of the number of users
[00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.100]   because now you have a potential connection
[00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.500]   between every person in it.
[00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:08.540]   Forget that math.
[00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:14.200]   In general, this was a big justification
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.780]   for why you could not unseat.
[00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.580]   You could not unseat existing platform monopolies.
[00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.680]   Then they got out of the connection business.
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.460]   They thought there was more money in offering distraction
[00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.740]   because people will spend more time distracting themselves
[00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.820]   than they wanna spend talking to their aunt or their cousin
[00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.060]   or their six friends from high school.
[00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.740]   And so Facebook and Instagram and Twitter,
[00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.860]   in particular Twitter and Facebook moved away
[00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.460]   from what's your friends up to.
[00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:47.460]   And towards here's an algorithmically generated feed
[00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.980]   of content curated to press some buttons in your brain
[00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:51.580]   and keep you looking at your phone.
[00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:54.580]   You need a moment to get lost or distracted.
[00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.300]   Life is hard, you're stressed, you're anxious, you're bored.
[00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.820]   We will give you something that'll be palliative
[00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:00.700]   in the moment.
[00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.320]   They went towards that model,
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:06.500]   which did get their existing users using the phones more,
[00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.180]   looking at these apps more,
[00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.060]   but it has destabilized
[00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:11.860]   the originally motivating network effect,
[00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.020]   which is the people you know are on here.
[00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.020]   Once it is no longer giving you that advantage,
[00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.460]   social media is now competing
[00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.460]   with any other form of distraction.
[00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:24.900]   And there's a lot of them and they're good.
[00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:28.460]   And now suddenly it's not so critical
[00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.140]   that my distraction is coming from Facebook
[00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:34.020]   versus coming from Spotify versus coming from TikTok
[00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:38.560]   or coming from some sort of bespoke, small niche network.
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.880]   You're competing with any source of distraction.
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:45.020]   There's no reason to have a massive $500 billion monopoly
[00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.740]   in this type of context.
[00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:50.900]   I can be just as diverting with my podcast
[00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:55.900]   that is produced with a slightly smaller budget
[00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:57.520]   than $500 billion a year.
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:01.060]   With even just half that money,
[00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:04.140]   I could produce deep questions.
[00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:05.120]   All right, so I think that's what's happening
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:05.960]   with social media.
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.780]   I think TikTok is actually the harbinger of this transition.
[00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:11.460]   Yes, it's true that TikTok is widely, widely used.
[00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:13.120]   It has a lot of active users,
[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.020]   but TikTok is different than Twitter.
[00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:17.520]   TikTok is different than Facebook from five years ago.
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:18.360]   Why?
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:22.900]   It's popular, but it's just pure distraction.
[00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:24.640]   They don't pretend like it's anything else.
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:25.480]   And because of that,
[00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:28.360]   it no longer has the situation of cultural valency
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.800]   where it feels like you have to use it.
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.100]   Lots of people use Facebook.
[00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:33.920]   No one thinks, I mean TikTok,
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.140]   no one thinks it's weird if you don't.
[00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:37.940]   A lot of people like TikTok.
[00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:41.960]   No one says you're missing out on business opportunities
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.620]   or knowing what's going on in the world if you don't use it.
[00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:48.060]   And so from TikTok, we'll get multiple other,
[00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:51.300]   I think increasingly niche, increasingly focused,
[00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:55.480]   increasingly much smaller and independent types of apps
[00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:57.400]   and sources of distraction that leverage
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.940]   social connections and groups, et cetera.
[00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:01.460]   And it'll be a fragmented marketplace
[00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:02.860]   in which there's no monopoly powers.
[00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:03.820]   And that's gonna be, I think,
[00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:05.320]   a much healthier social internet.
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.940]   So social media is a focused a lot of conversation.
[00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:09.820]   I think it's moment has passed.
[00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:11.700]   The final one I mentioned was AI.
[00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:13.500]   I don't know what to think about AI.
[00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:19.020]   I haven't got my arms around AI yet.
[00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:20.260]   I've been trying to.
[00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.300]   I mean, I understand a lot of the underlying technologies,
[00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:26.180]   but in terms of its cultural impact,
[00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:27.540]   I don't know where I fall.
[00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:29.900]   I don't have, for example,
[00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:33.880]   a natural fear of AI, general intelligence,
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:36.300]   sentience in AI and what that might cause.
[00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:40.180]   I just don't have that instinctual fear.
[00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:42.420]   Is that something that's even on a development pipeline
[00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:43.260]   that we need to worry about?
[00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.160]   I don't know either way.
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.460]   AI's role in disrupting industries,
[00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:48.620]   it's gonna be disruptive.
[00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:51.940]   It's complicated how I think it's hard to predict.
[00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:54.580]   So AI, keep your eye on it,
[00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:57.900]   but I don't have a good sense.
[00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:00.260]   Let me tell you two things that I think are being overlooked
[00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.340]   that are gonna be super disruptive,
[00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:03.340]   but I think are being overlooked
[00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:06.060]   in a lot of conversations today about technological trends.
[00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:08.660]   The first is augmented reality.
[00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:11.060]   This came out of some reporting I've done for the New Yorker.
[00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:13.740]   I don't think people realize the economic disruption
[00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:14.780]   that is going to come
[00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:17.580]   from what I call the augmented reality singularity.
[00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:21.140]   This is gonna be the point where multiple technologies
[00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:25.580]   that exist today advance sufficiently
[00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:28.620]   to allow the following
[00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:33.980]   with a relatively unobtrusive piece of headgear.
[00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:35.380]   So some sort of pair of glasses
[00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:39.140]   that is socially appropriate to wear, comfortable.
[00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:40.220]   It's not like Google Glass
[00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:42.180]   where you walk around with a Google Glass on.
[00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:44.100]   And I think Google tried this experiment.
[00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:46.140]   They said, try walking around with Google Glasses on
[00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:49.020]   and people's instinct when they saw you with on it was,
[00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:50.420]   I think I need to punch you.
[00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:53.560]   Like when we get past that,
[00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:54.900]   with Google Glass, people were walking around
[00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:58.060]   with Google Glasses and I'm not exaggerating here.
[00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:00.060]   Nuns would walk out of the convent,
[00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:02.860]   say, forgive me, father,
[00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:04.300]   and then just punch you in the face
[00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:06.900]   because it was so annoying looking.
[00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:11.500]   That's what AR.1, version one looks like.
[00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:12.560]   That will get better.
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:14.080]   So when we get past that stage
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.300]   where AR devices make people wanna punch you,
[00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:18.580]   you look so weird and pretentious wearing them.
[00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:20.120]   When we get past that stage,
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.460]   when nuns no longer walk out of their convents to punch you,
[00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:23.660]   and then two,
[00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:29.300]   two, we get a sufficient power and field of view
[00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:32.300]   in these glasses that you can replicate
[00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:34.620]   with sufficient resolution,
[00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:36.940]   basically any type of screen,
[00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:39.540]   digital screen interface we use today.
[00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:43.000]   And three, we have sort of sufficient internet backbone
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   that we can essentially stream screen surfaces
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.580]   without actually having to do the computation locally.
[00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:53.080]   And so what I mean by that is,
[00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:57.380]   if I want to play a video game,
[00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:00.140]   there's sufficient wireless internet backbone
[00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:03.500]   that that video game can run in a server somewhere.
[00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:05.820]   And the thing that's being streamed to my AR device
[00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:07.220]   is just what's on the screen.
[00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:09.020]   So there's this key point,
[00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:10.460]   there's this key speed point
[00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:13.900]   where the contents of a high resolution screen
[00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:16.260]   can be streamed over the internet to a device
[00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:17.140]   in which you no longer need
[00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:18.660]   to actually bring computation with you,
[00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:20.940]   just enough computation to get the screen of computation
[00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:21.840]   happening in the cloud.
[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:23.740]   When those three things come together,
[00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:26.220]   again, to summarize,
[00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:29.860]   hardware that is unobtrusive and people are willing to wear,
[00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:32.940]   sufficient field of view and resolution
[00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:36.020]   that you can replicate most of the standard digital screens
[00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:37.140]   you look at in your day-to-day life,
[00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:39.460]   and three, sufficient internet wireless backbone,
[00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:41.060]   which by the way, we might already have,
[00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:43.540]   that you can stream high resolution screens to devices
[00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:46.020]   so we can now virtualize actual computation.
[00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:52.220]   It will be the end of the consumer electronic industry
[00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:53.300]   as we know it.
[00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:58.900]   Samsung, Apple, Sony,
[00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:04.860]   the companies that produce complicated electronics
[00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:06.420]   that they sell to people,
[00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:09.080]   and those people buy these devices and use them.
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:12.900]   Those companies will essentially
[00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:15.960]   have to go out of business or massively retool
[00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:18.420]   because why would I buy a phone
[00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:21.900]   when my AR headset can put in front of me,
[00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:23.380]   in the space in front of me,
[00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:26.220]   the interface for whatever phone I want?
[00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:27.660]   Why would I buy a computer
[00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:30.100]   when I can make a computer monitor anywhere?
[00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:31.100]   It doesn't exist in the real world,
[00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:32.760]   it's being projected in my AR goggles,
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:36.020]   but I can make a nice monitor wherever I wanna go,
[00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:39.560]   and all the computation is happening in the cloud somewhere.
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:41.740]   So I have the most powerful computer computing,
[00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:43.540]   much more powerful than I could actually buy,
[00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:45.340]   and I can just see the screen right there.
[00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:46.360]   Why would I buy a TV
[00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:48.900]   when I could just stretch a 72 inch on my wall?
[00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:49.860]   It's all virtual.
[00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:51.020]   And everyone who's in that same room
[00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:52.180]   sees it in the same place.
[00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:53.620]   We literally cannot tell the difference
[00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:55.000]   between that and an actual TV.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.260]   Why would I buy a TV, ship it to me,
[00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:58.220]   bring it into my house?
[00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:01.540]   I could just have that right up there on my wall.
[00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:05.060]   The end of the consumer electronics industry as we know it,
[00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:07.300]   it's gonna create some of the most powerful companies
[00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:08.420]   in the history of the world.
[00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:12.060]   It's gonna make Apple seem like a lemonade stand.
[00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:15.340]   If you are the company that owns
[00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:18.340]   the first mainstream widely adopted
[00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:21.220]   full function AR singularity goggles
[00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:23.420]   with that backend doing all the computation,
[00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:26.180]   all of these companies like Sony, Samsung
[00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:28.220]   will become essentially software companies.
[00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:31.220]   You're basically just running processes in the cloud
[00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:34.980]   that can then stream visuals to individuals.
[00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:36.740]   It's hard to underestimate how disruptive
[00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:37.560]   that's gonna be.
[00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:39.460]   I don't think we talk enough about it.
[00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:41.980]   I think it was perhaps a blind spot of Mark Zuckerberg
[00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:43.660]   to focus too much on virtual reality
[00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:45.280]   instead of augmented reality.
[00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:48.480]   Google has invested many, many billions of dollars into this.
[00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:51.320]   Apple is investing many, many billions of dollars into this.
[00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:54.000]   Amazon is investing many, many billions of dollars into this
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.040]   less about the hardware
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:57.360]   and more about being the backend cloud computation
[00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:58.560]   to virtualize all this hardware.
[00:13:58.560 --> 00:13:59.720]   It is gonna be huge.
[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:01.120]   And I don't think we talk about it enough.
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:02.400]   We get too distracted.
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:04.920]   The other technological trend I think that's gonna be big
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:09.920]   is the continued decentralization of media production.
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:12.560]   This is the story of the internet,
[00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:15.560]   but I think it's just starting to get pretty interesting
[00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:16.720]   in recent years.
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:20.160]   So you get HTML in the 1990s,
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.960]   you get websites and then eventually web 2.0.
[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.720]   So it's websites that are easy for people
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:26.500]   to update regularly like blogs.
[00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:30.960]   That had a big impact on decentralizing the ability
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:34.280]   to produce and sell text.
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:35.520]   We take it for granted now,
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:37.520]   but remember in 1996,
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:39.960]   text came from magazines and newspapers.
[00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:41.520]   You had to have giant warehouses
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:45.040]   with these big machines with ink and newspaper rolls
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:47.360]   moving really fast and fleets of trucks.
[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:49.780]   And all the advertising dollars would come there.
[00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:50.980]   They had a ton of money.
[00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:53.480]   There's a lot of money in newspaper syndicates,
[00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:55.880]   a lot of money in magazine syndicates.
[00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:59.040]   That's where text was, available text.
[00:14:59.040 --> 00:14:59.880]   The internet changed that.
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:02.160]   Think about how many websites people go to now
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:03.420]   for information.
[00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:05.440]   How many independent little media companies,
[00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:07.380]   five person, six person shops.
[00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:09.920]   Ain't it cool news?
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:13.320]   Let's go back to those early days.
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:15.160]   These type of sites are blogs.
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:18.120]   Esther Klein came out of blogging
[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:19.360]   before moving over to the post
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:21.500]   and over to New York Times.
[00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:26.500]   Nate Silver, just all of this text, Politico.
[00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:30.600]   I mean, Politico eventually printed a hardcover version,
[00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:32.680]   a newspaper version for a while of their thing.
[00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:35.600]   But there was so much innovation that happened
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:38.380]   in text media because of HTML.
[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:41.800]   Now we're seeing this with audio, podcast.
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:43.960]   Incredibly disruptive.
[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:47.880]   This industry is exploding because people like
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:49.920]   real time analog content.
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:51.260]   We can actually hear someone's voice.
[00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:52.540]   Radio is a pretty big industry.
[00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:55.520]   Podcasts will surpass radio soon.
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:57.000]   It will surpass it soon.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.560]   Because again, you open up the ability
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:01.020]   to create audio to most people.
[00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:02.980]   The big change happening now is video.
[00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:08.440]   Video, the ability to produce video
[00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:10.920]   whose quality crosses that uncanny valley
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:12.560]   and is at least comparable to stuff
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:14.200]   that we maybe saw on cable.
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:15.080]   That's where we're getting now.
[00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:17.520]   Where more and more people at a fraction of the cost
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:21.640]   can produce video at a quality that you would say,
[00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:24.240]   I could have seen this 10 years ago on Bravo.
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:27.060]   And now you've decentralized video,
[00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:29.940]   which was the most powerful media forms of all, right?
[00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:34.920]   Television and movies is a huge dominant source of media
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:37.120]   and that is being decentralized now as well.
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:38.900]   These trends I think are critical.
[00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:41.560]   I think the shift from audio is the stepping stone
[00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:43.820]   and the video is gonna be much bigger
[00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:45.680]   than even the decentralization of text
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:49.840]   that happened with the early HTML based web.
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:51.200]   All of this I think is really excited.
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:52.040]   I don't know where it's going,
[00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:53.660]   but I think it's really exciting.
[00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:55.240]   The main critique people give,
[00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:56.560]   and I think this is so short-sighted,
[00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:58.960]   is every time one of these media technologies
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:03.120]   is decentralized, there's always this pushback
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:06.560]   that emerges where people set up this straw man
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.560]   of everyone now will be able to make a living
[00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:13.820]   off of this new decentralized media.
[00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:18.240]   And then when they don't, and most stuff is bad,
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:20.080]   they say the revolution is a failure.
[00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:23.480]   Oh, so blogs arise.
[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:26.880]   People looked around and said, well, most blogs are bad.
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.080]   This idea that everyone's gonna make a living
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:29.640]   off a blog isn't true.
[00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:31.240]   But that was never the point.
[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:33.220]   Yeah, most people are bad at producing stuff.
[00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:35.720]   Most people are not meant to be media figures.
[00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:38.400]   Most people don't have the insight or the training
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:41.680]   to produce really interesting audio or words or video.
[00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:43.340]   The point is when you open it up to everyone,
[00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:45.640]   you get this extreme Darwinian competition.
[00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:47.680]   And what is the point of Darwinian competition?
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:50.120]   Not that all the different types of proverbial species
[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:52.600]   are gonna survive, but that it's going to drive innovation
[00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:54.480]   into new species, new configurations
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:56.240]   that wouldn't have existed before.
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:58.480]   That is what is important about decentralization.
[00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:01.340]   There's 850,000 active podcasts right now.
[00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:03.320]   Most of them do not do very well,
[00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:06.200]   but that is a huge amount of selective pressure.
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:09.280]   It's gonna produce a couple thousand that do really well
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:10.120]   and are really innovative
[00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:12.160]   and will change the media landscape altogether.
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:13.600]   Most of YouTube is dreck,
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:16.920]   but there's millions and millions of hours of footage
[00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:19.100]   being uploaded every minute.
[00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:20.880]   That is a huge amount of selective pressure.
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:22.760]   It's gonna change and evolve
[00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:24.760]   and mutate the visual media landscape.
[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:27.360]   So I don't know where all this decentralization is going.
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:28.740]   I just think it's important.
[00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:29.880]   That's why I'm doing audio.
[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:32.740]   This is why Jesse and I were quick to get video
[00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:34.120]   going on the show as well.
[00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:35.740]   We think all of this is very important,
[00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:38.240]   even if we can't tell where it's going.
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:40.760]   All right, Miranda, that was a long answer.
[00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:43.880]   That was a long answer to a short question,
[00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:44.980]   but I'm glad you asked it.
[00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:46.740]   So really quick summary.
[00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:49.740]   Crypto, I think is overhyped.
[00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:51.120]   We're in the twilight of the massive
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:53.560]   social media monopoly era.
[00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:55.500]   AI, I don't know, keep an eye on it.
[00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:57.320]   I don't know what to tell you about it.
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:59.120]   Two biggest trends that are being missed.
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:00.360]   AR for sure.
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:02.360]   I think people don't understand the impact.
[00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:04.960]   Decentralized media, people know it's gonna be big,
[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:05.800]   but maybe they don't realize
[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:08.300]   how disruptive it's gonna be.
[00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:09.980]   I think the audio video,
[00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:11.720]   internet audio video revolution in particular
[00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:15.400]   is gonna be the biggest change to media since television.
[00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:17.980]   (upbeat music)
[00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:19.680]   (upbeat music)
