[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Our next call is from Jacqueline. She basically has a question about asking for help and how
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.040]   you go about it. Hi, Cal. Thanks so much for your podcast.
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.860]   It's helped me so much. Almost every day I refer to something that you said in your podcast
[00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:25.160]   in conversation with other folks. I really appreciate listening to your outlook on life,
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:31.400]   especially your sense of gratitude and lack of shaming. So I was really interested in
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.000]   your discussion with David Epstein in episode 39 about people being hindered by their own
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:45.500]   expertise or ego and how these can keep people from asking questions or asking for help.
[00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.240]   My question is about how you approach this problem. What is your mindset when you are
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:58.440]   asking questions or asking for help? Do you fear looking stupid? If so, how do you deal
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.520]   with that? Also, at a more technical level, how do you get help? For example, how do you
[00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:10.440]   know when to reach out, who to reach out to, and how to get what you need from that interaction?
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:16.520]   Just quickly, I consider this a productivity question because I think my inability to ask
[00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:23.160]   for help has been slowing my ability to get anything done. My PhD took me roughly nine
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.920]   years and now I'm still having trouble publishing chapters of my dissertation. I have the mindset
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.800]   that I should figure things out for myself, and I'm also scared of looking stupid. I think
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.720]   asking for help would help, but I haven't quite figured it out yet. Thanks so much.
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:46.400]   All right, Jaclyn, I like this question. Let me set your mind at ease. I'm a relatively
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:54.820]   smart guy, and I ask for help constantly in all areas of my life. Here's why I feel comfortable
[00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.600]   doing that. You can learn from my experience here. I guess you could call it the privilege,
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:07.000]   or you could call it the lack of luck, depending on how it's going to impact your mindset.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.560]   Whatever it is, I got to train at a place that we're surrounded by the very smartest
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:17.640]   people in the world. I was at MIT in the theory group at MIT, literally the smartest people
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:24.060]   in the world. I could throw a stone and hit three Turing Award winners and three MacArthur
[00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:30.520]   Genius Grant Award winners, one of whom who won the MacArthur when he was 17 and had been
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:36.840]   a tenured professor at MIT since he was 18. Incredibly smart people, not just, "Oh, that
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:43.840]   guy's sharp," but their brain can move things by staring at it.
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.960]   They ask questions all the time. Completely the smartest people in the world will use
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:58.680]   phrases such as, "Pretend like I am a child and explain this to me." They are the very
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.120]   first people to say at a talk, "Whoa, whoa, whoa. I don't know what that word means you
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:10.240]   just said. Slow way down. Slow way down. I don't understand that equation. Why is that
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.080]   right? Slow it down for me. Assume I don't know anything." It was the defining factor
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:20.480]   of the very smartest people in the world is that without any shame, they are constantly,
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.920]   constantly asking for people to slow down, to explain things simply.
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.880]   They're constantly faced with people who go way too fast because they're intimidated and
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.600]   say, "Well, this person's so smart. They're going to think I'm dumb. I got to..." They
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.560]   don't want you to go fast. They want you to go real slow. You want to understand each
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.520]   piece before they move on to the next. To me, that was incredibly instructive. Now,
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.160]   the reason why, of course, they don't care about doing that is that they know they're
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.600]   smart. They literally have a certificate that says genius and the 600,000 that comes along
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.760]   with that fellowship. They know they're smart, so they don't care about trying to look smart.
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.000]   By studying the smartest people in the world, you say, "What is probably the right thing
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.560]   to do?" It turns out it's to ask questions all the time.
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.720]   It's not a flaw with you if you don't understand something or someone's explaining something
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.360]   very confidently, and you're like, "I didn't get that." Nine times out of 10, it's not
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.320]   because you're missing something. It's because they're going way too fast, and they're just
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:20.560]   trying to look smart. This effect is so powerful that you can then, if you've been around these
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:26.160]   type of super brains, it becomes a counter signaling situation. When you see someone
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.760]   not asking for help or acting like everything is obvious or explaining something really
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:36.200]   fast, you immediately think, "Oh, that person's probably not that sharp. That person's compensating
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.400]   for something. That person is really worried about what people think about them." It becomes
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.480]   a counter signaling effect. The more questions you ask, the smarter you actually seem.
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:50.080]   So, Jacqueline, I'm going to say you learn from that experience. If you want to actually
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.560]   live in the world like a smart person, ask questions about everything you don't understand.
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.800]   If you don't know how to do something right, ask questions about that. I do this all the
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.280]   time. I call people. I'm known for this at Georgetown. If I'm put on a committee for
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.680]   something, I was like, "I have no idea how this works. What do I need to do?" I'm just
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:12.960]   like, "Let me just hold on, dial my phone. Hi, I'm dumb. I have no idea how any of this
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.720]   works. No, no, slow down even more. I was doing this recently. We're starting a new
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.960]   academic program I'm involved in." I had to do this with someone from the registrar's
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.200]   office. I was like, "Just start from scratch. I don't even know what that system is. What
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.840]   do you mean major? Just pretend I am 12." Then I did this the other day. I had to call
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.200]   the admissions department because they needed to turn something on. I was like, "Look, just
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:41.520]   start from scratch. I don't know anything." It's really useful to everyone involved. Everyone
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.960]   always pretends like they understand things, don't understand anything.
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:49.400]   So, Jacqueline, that is the mindset you should be in. By asking the most fundamental questions
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.120]   about how things work or why something is true, you are going to be setting yourself
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:58.520]   up for having the very smartest insights and the very best work. When it comes to help,
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:05.220]   ask for it. "Hey, I'm having a hard time writing my chapters. Let's talk about it. I need help."
[00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.240]   Talk to your old advisors. Talk to people you know. "What's going on here? Should I
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:12.040]   rethink this? Should I change my habits?" Be in that habit. I'm glad you asked this
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:16.000]   because I want everyone to be in this habit. Ask for help all the time. That is what's
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.800]   going to make you paradoxically seem way smarter than the guy on the other side of the room
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:26.160]   trying to play it cool and is fooling nobody. The guy who's trying to desperately make it
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.440]   seem like, "I guess I know everything and I understand everything." No one is fooled
[00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.840]   by that person. It is slowing down their ability to have original thoughts or get useful things
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:42.480]   done. Ignore that person. Ask questions. If I do it, if those supersized brains at MIT
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:48.440]   were doing it, then you should feel absolutely secure doing it yourself. That being said,
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:55.640]   whenever Jesse asked me for help, I yell at him. That's more of a discipline thing. If
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:00.160]   you don't know how to do this, then maybe you don't belong here. That's what I say.
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.280]   Take your $250,000 a month out of here. Buy a pull-up bar.
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.880]   What do you do with that $250,000 a month? I know you're not putting it into your truck.
[00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:12.080]   I know that's not where you're investing it. Go get our pull-up bar installed. What the
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:12.720]   hell's going on here?
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:13.760]   *sniffs*
