[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640]   Hi, I'm here with Carrie Phelps, founding product manager at Weights and Biases,
[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.920]   and instructor for this short course, Evaluating and Debugging Genitive AI.
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.640]   Hey, Andrew, thanks for having me.
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.680]   Machine learning development is an iterative process.
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.960]   You train a model, then maybe decide to tune a parameter, then retrain the model,
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.200]   and then next decide to expand the training set and so on.
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.560]   I used to keep track of all the different models I was training in a text file or
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.360]   sometimes in a spreadsheet, and after a while it gets messy and you easily forget.
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.840]   And you go, wait, what data set did I use last week?
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.480]   And what exactly did I do that resulted in that improvement to the model accuracy?
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.280]   Weights and Biases has become a bit of an industry standard for machine
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.840]   learning experiment tracking.
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.960]   In this short course, Carrie will teach you how to use these tools for the
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.120]   development of generative AI models.
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.200]   Compared to supervised learning, generative AI adds an extra layer of
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.760]   complexity because the model outputs are harder to evaluate.
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.640]   Carrie is an expert on these issues and has focused the last five years of her
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.800]   career on the process of systematically evaluating and debugging machine
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:05.600]   learning models.
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.880]   So it's great to have you teach this.
[00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.800]   So can you share with learners what they'll learn in this course?
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:11.840]   Absolutely.
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.880]   You'll learn to monitor and debug experiments to quickly iterate and get a
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.880]   validated model to deploy to production.
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.840]   You'll trace, debug, and evaluate generative models and visually compare
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.200]   outputs as you iterate.
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.360]   By the end of this course, you'll have a solid understanding of best practices
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.040]   for reproducible model development.
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.720]   Go from hacking on a notebook by yourself to validating and sharing models
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.080]   collaboratively with your team.
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.640]   So I find that having a systematic workflow for developing machine learning
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.280]   projects can make you much more productive and help you get to that
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.640]   working model or get to that breakthrough result much faster.
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.440]   I hope you take and enjoy this course.
