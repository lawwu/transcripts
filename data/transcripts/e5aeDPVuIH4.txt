[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   Previously on Grace To You.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.460]   So how do you sort out an apostle from everybody else?
[00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.260]   You have somebody teaching over here and somebody teaching over here.
[00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.240]   How do you know who's true?
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.920]   Well, the one who does miracles gives evidence of speaking the Word of God
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.000]   because he's being validated by the power of God.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.440]   As in the case of Christ, we're to validate his claim to be God,
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.120]   and the miracles done by the apostles were to validate their claim
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.580]   to be the messengers of God who spoke on his behalf.
[00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.520]   What in the world makes us so embarrassed about the gospel?
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:49.000]   I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:01:10.720]   When you come into Matthew 26, verse 31,
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:17.900]   Jesus said to the disciples, they were in the Mount of Olives the night of his betrayal,
[00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:18.980]   Peter said,
[00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:19.380]   Jesus said to him,
[00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.680]   Jesus said to him,
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.780]   Truly I say to you that this very night before a rooster crows, you will deny me three times.
[00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.700]   Peter said to him,
[00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.660]   Even if I have to die with you, I will not deny you.
[00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.740]   And the disciples said the same thing too.
[00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.120]   Fast forward to the end of the chapter in verse 69.
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.160]   But he denied it before them all, saying,
[00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.460]   You may not know what you're talking about.
[00:01:50.460 --> 00:02:01.260]   The great revelation didn't insulate him from a moment when he became a tool of the devil.
[00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:11.020]   He may have called out in love, he may have made this statement in compassion, but he
[00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.920]   was saying exactly what the devil was saying.
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.040]   You can have the crown without the cross.
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:27.420]   If that was a terribly disastrous moment, there's a worse one, the great rejection.
[00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.640]   Look at Matthew 26.
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:38.780]   A man given great revelation, promise of great reward, foundation of the church, has a moment
[00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.040]   in which he speaks for Satan.
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.520]   And then when you come into Matthew 26, verse 31,
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:53.520]   Jesus said to the disciples, they were in the Mount of Olives the night of his betrayal,
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.700]   "You will all fall away because of me this night, for it is written, I will strike down
[00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.140]   the shepherd and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered.
[00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.100]   But after I have been raised, I will go ahead of you to Galilee."
[00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:11.600]   But Peter said to him, "Even though all may fall away because of you, I will never fall
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.600]   away."
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.600]   He said, "I will never fall away."
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:14.600]   He said, "I will never fall away."
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:15.600]   He said, "I will never fall away."
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.000]   He said, "I will never fall away."
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.880]   Jesus said to him, "Truly I say to you that this very night before a rooster crows, you
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.220]   will deny me three times."
[00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:30.700]   Peter said to him, "Even if I have to die with you, I will not deny you."
[00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:36.440]   And the disciples said the same thing too.
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:43.840]   Fast forward to the end of the chapter in verse 69.
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.480]   Jesus was betrayed.
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:52.380]   Before Caiaphas, the high priest on trial, Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard,
[00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.560]   and a servant girl came to him and said, "You too were with Jesus the Galilean."
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.500]   But he denied it before them all, saying, "I do not know what you're talking about."
[00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.040]   When he had gone out to the gateway, another servant girl saw him and said to those who
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.240]   were there, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth."
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.480]   And again he denied it with an oath.
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.320]   "I do not know the man.
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.280]   I do not know the man."
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.120]   A little later the bystanders came up and said to Peter, "Surely you too are one of
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.000]   them, for even the way you talk gives you away."
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.140]   You have that Galilean accent.
[00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:31.080]   And then he began to curse and swear.
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.320]   "I do not know the man."
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:42.840]   And immediately a rooster crowed, and Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said before
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:43.800]   a rooster crows.
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.440]   "You will deny me three times."
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:53.220]   And he went out and wept bitterly.
[00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:59.800]   The recipient of great revelation, the promise of a great reward, part of the foundation
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:11.980]   of the church, he spoke for the devil, and he denied his Lord on three separate occasions
[00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:13.280]   in three different locations.
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:20.340]   Probably multiple times.
[00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:26.980]   But before you run too fast to condemn Peter, at least he was there, nobody else was.
[00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:31.900]   All the rest of the disciples had fled.
[00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:37.340]   Something has to be said for the fact that he was there.
[00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:41.680]   He was at the high priest's house.
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.760]   It's the kind of failure that only happens.
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.520]   It only happens to the brave.
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:51.520]   It only happens to the people who are in a position where it can happen.
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.580]   It only happens to people who get close to the enemy.
[00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:01.780]   So, is that the end of the story?
[00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:05.760]   Is Peter now useless?
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:11.920]   No, he received a great revelation, was given a promise of a great reward, did great wrong.
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:21.260]   And committed the crime of great rejection.
[00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:22.400]   But there's a recommissioning.
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.140]   Go to John 21.
[00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:31.440]   John 21.
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.800]   After the resurrection, Jesus told the disciples to go to Galilee and wait for Him there, and
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.920]   that He would come and meet them.
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:37.920]   And they did.
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:38.920]   They went to Galilee.
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:39.920]   They went to Jerusalem.
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:40.920]   They went to Jerusalem.
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:41.920]   They went to Jerusalem.
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:42.920]   They went to Jerusalem.
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:43.920]   Peter had not done that.
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.200]   He had gone back to his old career of fishing.
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:52.680]   We learned that earlier in the chapter.
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:57.060]   And now at breakfast, we read that when they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon
[00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:05.840]   Peter right on the shore of the Sea of Galilee, "Simon, son of John, do you love Me more than
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:06.840]   these?"
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:08.320]   What do you mean, these?
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:09.960]   These fishing implements?
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:11.400]   No.
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:16.020]   You can understand how Peter felt.
[00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:24.640]   I was a colossal failure when in the courtyard.
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:30.820]   My crime was of the kind that Judas committed.
[00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:35.820]   I'm not worthy to be an apostle.
[00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:36.820]   Maybe I can't do it.
[00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:38.400]   I'm going to go back to fishing.
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.880]   I'm going to go back to fishing.
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:42.120]   I'm going to go back to fishing.
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:46.160]   So the Lord comes to him and says, "Do you love Me more than these trappings that go
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.800]   with fishing?"
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:51.000]   He said, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love You."
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.620]   He said to him, "Tend My lambs."
[00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:59.700]   That's the recommissioning of Peter to serve the great Shepherd by being a Shepherd of
[00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:02.080]   his flock.
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:08.080]   He said to him a second time, "Simon, son of John, do you love Me?"
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.720]   He said to him, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love You."
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:15.220]   He said to him, "Shepherd My sheep."
[00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:17.900]   He said to him the third time, "Simon, son of John, do you love Me?"
[00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:23.300]   Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, "Do you love Me?"
[00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:26.720]   And he actually used the word that Peter used.
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:30.280]   The Lord says, "Do you love Me with the highest and noblest kind of love?"
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:33.240]   Peter says with a different word, "I have affection for you."
[00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:35.480]   Didn't think he could claim more than that.
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:38.060]   "I have affection for you.
[00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:40.560]   Can I at least get by with claiming that in my life?"
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:41.560]   He said, "Yes, Lord, I have affection for you."
[00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:42.560]   Peter said, "I have affection for you."
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:43.560]   He said, "I have affection for you."
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:44.560]   Peter said, "I have affection for you."
[00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:45.560]   He said, "I have affection for you."
[00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:46.560]   Peter said, "I have affection for you."
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:47.560]   Peter said, "I have affection for you."
[00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:48.560]   Peter said, "I have affection for you."
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:49.560]   Peter said, "I have affection for you."
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:50.560]   Peter said, "I have affection for you."
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:51.560]   Peter said, "I have affection for you."
[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:52.560]   Peter said, "I have affection for you."
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:53.560]   Peter said, "I have affection for you."
[00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:54.560]   Peter said, "I have affection for you."
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:55.560]   Peter said, "I have affection for you."
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:56.560]   Peter said, "I have affection for you."
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:57.560]   Peter said, "I have affection for you."
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:58.560]   Peter said, "I have affection for you."
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:03.320]   That's the recommissioning of Peter.
[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:20.340]   It's an amazing, amazing picture of the most tragic failure becoming Christ's special chosen
[00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:25.040]   shepherd for His flock.
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:28.400]   Go to the book of Acts, because that's the next page.
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:34.400]   What does Peter look like in the book of Acts now that he's been recommissioned?
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:45.480]   Well, in the book of Acts, the apostles are listed in verse 13, and there he is, Peter,
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:49.420]   then John, James, Andrew, Philip, Thomas, and the rest.
[00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:53.260]   He's still the leader.
[00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:58.240]   And then it's time to choose somebody to take the place of Judas, and verse 15, "As
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:03.180]   at this time Peter stood up in the midst of the brethren, a gathering of 120 persons were
[00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:08.520]   there together, and said, 'Brethren, the Scripture has to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:13.440]   foretold by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.440]   Jesus.'"
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:17.660]   And by the way, Peter for the first time had an understanding of the Old Testament, and
[00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:22.100]   he quotes it all through this end, chapter 2.
[00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:27.600]   We have to choose somebody to take his place is what is going on here, but Peter is the
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:28.080]   one who initiated the battle.
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:34.980]   He's the one who initiates that effort, and we know the story.
[00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:40.960]   The lot at the end of chapter 1, verse 26, fell to Matthias, and he was added to the
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:42.620]   eleven apostles.
[00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:46.780]   Peter has enough boldness to step up and say, "This is what we need to do."
[00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:48.440]   He's back in a leadership position.
[00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:54.920]   He has to some degree recovered his confidence from the horrors of his denials.
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:57.920]   And then in chapter 2:14, "He said, 'I will be your leader, and I will be your leader,
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:58.920]   and I will be your leader.'"
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:10:59.920]   It's even more amazing.
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:06.260]   Day of Pentecost, "Peter, taking his stand with the eleven, raised his voice and declared
[00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:10.580]   to them, 'Men of Judea and all you who live in Jerusalem, let this be known to you and
[00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:12.960]   give heed to my words.'
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:18.880]   The Spirit having come on them, he preaches this incredibly powerful sermon.
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:27.760]   The church is born that day, and three thousand people" - verse 41 - "are gathered together."
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:32.360]   "The first day the church existed."
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:38.500]   Peter is back, and he's back with power.
[00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:43.720]   In chapter 3, we see him again.
[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:47.260]   He is in the temple along with John.
[00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:55.480]   They see a man there who has been begging alms, been lame from his mother's womb.
[00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:56.920]   He was actually carried.
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:00.360]   They would set him down every day at the gate of the temple called Beautiful.
[00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:04.920]   When he saw Peter and John about to go into the temple, he began asking to receive alms,
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:05.920]   begging.
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:10.160]   But Peter, along with John, fixed his gaze on him and said, "Look at us."
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:14.420]   And he began to give them his attention, expecting to receive something from them.
[00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:19.760]   But Peter said, "I do not possess silver and gold, but what I do have I give to you in
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:23.160]   the name of Jesus Christ, the Nazarene.
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:24.160]   Walk."
[00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.760]   And seizing him by the right hand, he raised
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:30.200]   him up, and immediately his feet and his ankles were strengthened.
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:33.520]   With a leap he stood upright and began to walk, and he entered the temple with
[00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:37.200]   them, walking and leaping and praising God.
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:41.200]   And all the people saw him walking and praising God, and they were taking note of him as
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:44.880]   being the one who used to sit at the beautiful gate of the temple to beg alms.
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:51.160]   They were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.
[00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:55.240]   And verse 11 says, "He was clinging to Peter and John."
[00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:56.600]   No doubt.
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:05.620]   In chapter 4, he defied the Sanhedrin.
[00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:06.980]   They were preaching.
[00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:09.900]   The Sanhedrin had forbidden them to do that.
[00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:18.880]   Verse 3, they laid hands on the apostles, put them in jail.
[00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:20.440]   They were told not to preach.
[00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:26.440]   Verse 8, Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, launches again, preaching Christ.
[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:31.580]   They could not stop him.
[00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:34.360]   They could not silence him.
[00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:37.200]   No threat could do that.
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:44.000]   Eventually, they let him go, and you know the rest of the story.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:51.240]   When you come to chapter 5, he is the one who confronts Ananias and Zephira, who lied
[00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:56.280]   to the Holy Spirit.
[00:13:56.280 --> 00:14:01.480]   He says in chapter 5, verse 3, "Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the
[00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:08.320]   Holy Spirit and to keep back some of the price of the land?
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:13.520]   While it remained unsold, did it not remain your own?
[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:17.140]   You have not lied to men," he says at the end of verse 4, "but to God."
[00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:20.460]   And as he heard these words, Ananias fell down and breathed his last, and great fear
[00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:24.320]   came over all who heard of it."
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:26.120]   The young men got up and covered him up.
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:31.080]   And after carrying him out, they buried him.
[00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:36.240]   There was an elapsed interval of about three hours, and his wife showed up.
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:40.000]   Peter responded to her, "Tell me whether you sold the land for such and such a price?"
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.980]   And she said, "Yes, that was the price."
[00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:45.780]   Peter said to her, "Why is it that you have agreed together to put the Spirit of the Lord
[00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:46.780]   to the test?
[00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:50.220]   Behold, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they'll
[00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:52.500]   carry you out as well."
[00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:55.960]   And immediately she fell at his feet and breathed her life.
[00:14:55.960 --> 00:15:02.640]   Peter was buried at the door last, and she was buried beside her husband.
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:06.600]   Peter is a powerful person.
[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:11.040]   He's the one that inaugurates the selection of the twelfth apostle.
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:13.840]   He's the one that preaches the great sermon on Pentecost.
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:17.560]   He's the one that defies the Sanhedrin.
[00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:22.280]   He is the one that heals the man born lame.
[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:25.800]   He is the one who deals with lies.
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:30.700]   He is the one that pollutes the church.
[00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:42.400]   In chapter 8, a familiar and amazing story of Simon the magician.
[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:47.560]   And Peter again is the figure that deals with him.
[00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:55.640]   When Simon wanted to buy the Holy Spirit, verse 18 of chapter 8, Peter said, "I will
[00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:56.640]   buy the Holy Spirit."
[00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:02.580]   Verse 18 and 19, "May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain
[00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:05.060]   the gift of God with money.
[00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:10.540]   You have no part or portion in this matter, for your heart is not right with God.
[00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:14.100]   Therefore repent of this wickedness of yours, and pray the Lord, if possible, the intention
[00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:16.940]   of your heart may be forgiven you.
[00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:20.860]   For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bondage of iniquity."
[00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:24.840]   But Simon answered and said, "Pray to the Lord for me yourselves, so that nothing of
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:25.480]   what you have said may be forgiven you."
[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:27.580]   He said, "May come upon me."
[00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:29.760]   He rejected real repentance.
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:34.140]   Again, Peter is exercising amazing authority.
[00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:41.080]   He's behaving in a way that is almost like the Lord would behave if He were there.
[00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:45.960]   In the tenth chapter, you know the story.
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:48.920]   He takes the gospel to the Gentiles.
[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:51.100]   We can go all the way to verse 34.
[00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:55.320]   "Cornelius, opening his mouth, Peter said, 'I most certainly understand now that God is
[00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:57.300]   not one to show partiality.
[00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:01.840]   For in every nation the man who fears Him and does what is right is welcome to Him.
[00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:06.800]   The word which He sent to the sons of Israel, preaching peace through Jesus Christ, He is
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:08.140]   Lord of all.
[00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:13.540]   You yourselves know the thing which took place throughout all Judea, starting from Galilee,
[00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:15.840]   after the baptism which John proclaimed.
[00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:20.200]   You know of Jesus of Nazareth, how God anointed Him with the Holy Spirit and with power, and
[00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:25.160]   how He went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:29.020]   with Him.'"
[00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:30.920]   What happened?
[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:35.920]   While Peter was preaching, verse 44, the Holy Spirit fell upon all those who were listening
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:37.540]   to the message.
[00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:41.020]   All the circumcised believers who came with Peter were amazed because the gift of the
[00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:44.760]   Holy Spirit had been poured out on the Gentiles.
[00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:50.640]   Also they were speaking in languages and exalting God, just as the Jews had done on the day
[00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:55.000]   of Pentecost.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:00.220]   This is a pretty stunning life.
[00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:10.240]   Immediately after his recommissioning, Peter becomes the primary representative of the
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:13.720]   Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:21.100]   If we had time, we could go back through the gospels, and we would learn that in Matthew
[00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:24.840]   chapter 17, for example.
[00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:25.840]   What did Jesus do?
[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:28.420]   He taught Peter submission.
[00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:32.820]   In John 18, He taught him restraint.
[00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:38.960]   In Matthew 26, as well as John 13, He taught him humility.
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:44.500]   Also in Matthew 18, He taught him forgiveness, 70 times 7.
[00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:50.880]   In John 21, He taught him sacrifice, the sacrifice of his own life.
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.680]   In John 21, He taught him love.
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:54.680]   "Do you love Me?"
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:58.100]   In John 21, He said, "You're going to die.
[00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:00.060]   Your life is going to be taken from you."
[00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:06.980]   And so He basically prepared him to be courageous.
[00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:12.980]   Through all of these encounters in the life of Jesus and Peter, Jesus was strengthening
[00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:21.020]   Peter for this incredible, incredible ministry responsibility that he would have in the book
[00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:24.520]   of Acts.
[00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:30.100]   Now, that was for an apostle.
[00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:32.280]   None of us could ever hope to have that.
[00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:37.840]   Well, He also gave Peter with James and John a glimpse of glory, right?
[00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:41.920]   Matthew 17, the transfiguration took Him to the mountain so they could see Him in His
[00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:44.200]   second coming glory, and Peter writes about that.
[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:51.600]   Oh, by the way, in his letter, in Peter's letter, 1 Peter and 2 Peter, he writes about
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:54.360]   submission, restraint, humility, forgiveness.
[00:19:54.360 --> 00:20:00.680]   Sacrifice, love, courage, faith, and glory.
[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:02.960]   He remembered all those lessons.
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:07.480]   And oh, by the way, he also writes about being a shepherd of the flock.
[00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:13.280]   The Lord said, "Feed My sheep," and that's exactly what he did, and he enjoined other
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:19.520]   shepherds to feed the flock of God, 1 Peter 5.
[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:24.200]   But there was one final glimpse of Peter that stands out.
[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:30.080]   And it's Matthew 16 again.
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:43.960]   And in Matthew 16, verse 19: "I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven.
[00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:47.140]   Whatever you bind on earth shall have been bound in heaven; whatever you loose on earth
[00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:49.080]   shall have been loosed in heaven."
[00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:52.000]   Now, what is that?
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   What do you mean?
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.040]   "Well, I'm going to be a shepherd of the flock.
[00:20:54.040 --> 00:21:01.560]   I'm going to give you the ability to unlock the kingdom."
[00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:06.920]   And borrowing language from rabbis, the rabbis used to say, "You are either bound in your
[00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:08.760]   sin or loosed from your sin."
[00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:11.720]   Binding and loosing was rabbinic talk.
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:17.220]   So Peter, "I'm going to give you the keys to the kingdom, and you can declare to people
[00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:22.840]   you're bound in your sins, or you are loosed from your sins.
[00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:28.520]   Whatever you bind on earth shall have been bound in heaven; whatever you loose on earth
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:30.840]   shall have been loosed in heaven."
[00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:32.940]   What is he saying?
[00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:39.260]   He's saying, "You're going to be able to tell people, 'Here is the door to the kingdom.
[00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:45.700]   I will give you the key, the gospel, which opens the door, and I will tell you by how
[00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:52.680]   you respond to the gospel whether you're bound in your sins or loosed from your sins.'"
[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:57.060]   This isn't papal authority.
[00:21:57.060 --> 00:22:00.020]   This isn't authority to forgive sin.
[00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:06.260]   This is simply authority to open the kingdom door with the key, which is the gospel, and
[00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:10.720]   to say to someone, "If you believe the gospel, you're loosed from your sins.
[00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:14.820]   If you don't believe the gospel, you're bound in your sins."
[00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:19.880]   That is the most important thing that Peter could ever do, would be to have the key to
[00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:22.520]   the kingdom and open the door.
[00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:29.140]   And tell people that they were either loosed or bound in sin by how they responded to the
[00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:30.140]   gospel.
[00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:34.520]   And you say, "Well, was that for Peter only?"
[00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:48.520]   No, because over in John chapter 20 and verse 20, our Lord is talking to the disciples.
[00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:52.360]   This is after the resurrection.
[00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:59.840]   "They said - " look at my hands and my side - " and they rejoiced when they saw the Lord.
[00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:05.240]   So Jesus said to them again, 'Peace be with you.
[00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:08.440]   As the Father has sent Me, I also send you.'
[00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:12.640]   And when He had said this, He breathed on them and said to them, 'Receive the Holy Spirit.
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:15.760]   If you forgive the sins of any, their sins have been forgiven.
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:18.620]   If you retain the sins of any, they have been retained.'"
[00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:22.200]   He extends that power that He gave to Peter to the rest of the apostles.
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:30.120]   And saying the same thing, "If you, because people believe the gospel, tell them their
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:36.560]   sins are forgiven, you are authorized by heaven to say that."
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:43.260]   All the apostles had that same authority to declare that people's sins were forgiven.
[00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:47.580]   If you believe the gospel, I declare unto you, your sins are forgiven.
[00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:52.040]   If you do not believe the gospel, then your sins are not forgiven.
[00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:58.140]   The twelve were also then given the keys, the gospel key that opens the kingdom, and
[00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:04.820]   the right by whatever response a person has to declare whether they were freed from sin
[00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:07.900]   or bound in sin.
[00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:17.400]   Now to wrap that up, go to Matthew 18, Matthew 18.
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:21.880]   This all seems so marvelous and grand and apostolic.
[00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:30.740]   But let's pick up something very familiar, Matthew 18:15, talking to believers.
[00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:37.180]   "If your brother sins - " this is for all of us " - go and show him his fault in private.
[00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:39.900]   If he listens to you, you've won your brother.
[00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:44.360]   If he doesn't listen to you, take one or two more with you, so that by the mouth of two
[00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:48.760]   or three witnesses every fact may be conferred.
[00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:51.720]   If he refuses to listen, tell it to the church.
[00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:57.840]   If he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector."
[00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:05.100]   And then look at verse 18: "Truly I say to you" - and this is to the church - "whatever
[00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:10.560]   you bind on earth shall have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:12.280]   have been loosed in heaven."
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:14.520]   This is incredible.
[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:21.560]   This is for all of us when we go to someone and confront them about their sin, and they
[00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:23.180]   will not repent.
[00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:31.620]   We have the authority that Peter and the apostles said to say, "Based upon your rejection, you
[00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:36.820]   are bound in your sin.
[00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:42.140]   Based upon your repentance, you're loosed from your sin."
[00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:46.720]   Not for a moment would you want to consider yourself an apostle, not Peter.
[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:51.400]   He seems far away from what we are.
[00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:55.040]   You wouldn't want to even consider yourself one of the other apostles.
[00:25:55.040 --> 00:26:00.180]   But the truth of the matter is, you bear the same authority of the apostles.
[00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:06.400]   Based upon how people respond to the gospel and the Word of God, you can say, "You are
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:12.560]   free from your sins, or you are bound in your sins."
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:16.760]   Which reminds us, folks, what we're talking about when we're talking about the gospel.
[00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:21.240]   We're talking about sin and forgiveness.
[00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:26.000]   Not a happy life.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.720]   It's not personal authority.
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:33.740]   It's authority based on biblical truth.
[00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:39.860]   You can say to someone, "You reject the gospel, you're bound in your sins forever.
[00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:45.340]   You believe the gospel, you're loosed from your sins."
[00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:51.080]   We're given the right to say that based upon how people respond to the gospel.
[00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:55.540]   We're even given the right to say that within the framework of the church, based upon how
[00:26:55.540 --> 00:27:02.580]   people respond to being confronted by others over their sin.
[00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:08.860]   And when they refuse to repent, treat them like a tax collector and a Gentile or an outcast,
[00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:16.100]   because they may well not even be believers at all.
[00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:20.920]   So God has given us immense, immense authority.
[00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:24.060]   From His word.
[00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:28.920]   And we carry that apostolic authority based on this book.
[00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:34.660]   Scripture is filled with a variety of characters, men and women, experiencing the challenges
[00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:37.400]   of life much like we do today.
[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:42.960]   Through their triumphs and failures, we see God's power, wisdom, and grace on display
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:45.080]   in their lives.
[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:50.760]   Pastor John's book, Forty Lives in Forty Days, is a devotional compilation of numerous familiar
[00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:54.080]   lives we've heard about since we were children.
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:28:00.100]   People like Paul, Jonah, Ruth, Rahab, and the Apostle Peter that we learned about in
[00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:01.640]   today's message.
[00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:06.720]   By reading these concise character studies, you'll gain a deeper appreciation for how
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:12.160]   God orchestrates even your own life for His glorious purposes.
[00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:19.540]   Order a copy of Forty Lives in Forty Days by calling 888-57-GRACE, that's 888-57-GRACE,

[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:29.060]   On behalf of John MacArthur, thank you for joining us today as we learned about the failures
[00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:30.480]   and restoration of Peter.
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:32.980]   We'll see you next time on Grace To You.
