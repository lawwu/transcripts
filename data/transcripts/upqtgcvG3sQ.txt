[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   [Music]
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:11.320]   Christian conspiracy theories. That's today's theme. We need to address them as we hear from Lindsey, a listener with today's question.
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:19.320]   Hello, Pastor John. Thank you for this podcast. I have a friend who is convinced that the new COVID-19 vaccines are the mark of the beast.
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:26.040]   Anyone injected is given over to Satan and is thereby lost forever per revelation.
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:33.600]   I'm very much unconvinced of this, but how would you respond to Christians who are given to these types of spiritual conspiracy theories?
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.680]   And then if possible, what exactly is the mark of the beast in Revelation 16 - in
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.860]   1920? My concern
[00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.680]   with this question relates mainly to the first thing that
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.400]   Lindsey asks about, namely, what should we think and do in
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.000]   response to people who gravitate to what Lindsey calls
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.040]   spiritual conspiracy theories. And that's not a new question.
[00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:08.280]   In every generation, there have been predictions of the end of the world and
[00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.840]   speculations about world leaders as the Antichrist and
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.840]   calamities which definitely signified the soon end of the world and
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.360]   political events that definitely fulfill
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.880]   last day
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.820]   biblical prophecies and bizarre
[00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.080]   sequences of
[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.520]   events which cause the spinning out of
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.920]   conspiratorial webs which have an uncanny way of being self-confirming and
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:48.000]   then peter out in the end and are forgotten for a few decades until they start all over again.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.760]   So that's not new. What's new is
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.560]   not the
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.080]   alarmist
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.720]   mentalities or conspiracy theories or vocal doomsayers.
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:06.160]   What's new is the presence of social media and the speed and ease and extent
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.440]   to which these theories
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.560]   spread.
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.320]   So how should we respond now, especially
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:21.760]   personally? If we know someone who is given to this kind of speculation and intrigue,
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:28.000]   what should we do if we know someone who always seems to be sniffing out
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.040]   something other than what is plainly there? And my answer to this is based on a certain
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.680]   diagnosis of what's going on in their mind.
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.760]   What I've seen over the years is
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.040]   that there's a certain kind of
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.640]   personality or more seriously, we could call it a certain kind of
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.640]   spiritual condition that seems unable to be
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.320]   profoundly engaged with,
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:06.400]   unable to be deeply moved by, unable to rejoice in the great central
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.680]   glorious realities of the Christian faith. They're always on the margins.
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.560]   It's as though their minds and hearts are like magnets that are constantly
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.840]   attracting little iron fragments from the edges instead of the big
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:30.400]   massive thing at the center. And ultimately the things of greatest importance get
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.520]   neglected. The glory, the wonder, the beauty of the Christian faith is
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.200]   passed over and they're always fascinated with marginal things that are not
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.280]   preeminent.
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:52.280]   Here's an example because I've felt this so personally over the years as I was a pastor because there were people like that in my
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.080]   church. I knew them. I knew how they responded to things.
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.240]   I recall preaching a sermon one time and pouring out my heart
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:05.120]   concerning Christ and his work and his beauty and his brightness and his worth, his
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.240]   humble perfections as a man, his agonizing death, his
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:17.800]   triumphant resurrection, his victory over Satan and hell and death, his reign in heaven,
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:23.600]   just giving everything I've had to show the magnificent, glorious, weighty, central reality of
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.680]   Jesus Christ and the way of salvation. And a man
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.400]   took my hand at the door
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.760]   afterward and with great excitement said,
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.800]   "Have you seen this article that put another puzzle piece in place
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.480]   for his little
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.880]   conspiratorial fascination?"
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:54.000]   Now that response wasn't new for him. It was typical. It didn't surprise me, but it was just sad.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.240]   He could sit under the passionate biblical
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.920]   preaching of the greatest realities in the universe and
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.400]   be absolutely
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.280]   unfazed,
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.040]   unfazed
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.920]   by that because of his controlling
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.080]   interest in marginal
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.160]   speculations.
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:25.000]   Amazing. Now that, I would say, is a spiritual disease and our response to it,
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.240]   I think, should be personally,
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.360]   relationally,
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:36.120]   prayerfully to constantly do our best to direct that person's attention
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.800]   toward grand,
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.880]   central realities of the Christian faith that are
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.480]   right at the heart of what God is doing in Jesus Christ.
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:51.800]   They think they are being biblical and
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.360]   passionate for truth,
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.760]   but in fact the main truths
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.280]   hold no interest for them.
[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:06.320]   It does little good to try to address their speculations directly.
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:10.600]   There's just so much conjecture that you can't get anywhere.
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:19.320]   What's needed is an awakening of the heart to the superior worth and greatness and beauty of the most
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.960]   important things in Scripture.
[00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:28.600]   So here's a picture that may capture it. The right ordering of our thoughts about reality
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:32.240]   comes from a right view, a right
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:38.600]   valuing of God and Christ and salvation at the center of all of our other thoughts.
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.240]   The picture is like a solar system, right?
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:49.000]   The Sun is at the center of the solar system and when the Sun is central, the planets are all orbiting
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:55.440]   safely, beautifully in their proper place. That's a picture of God at the center and all of our thoughts
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:58.000]   assuming their rightful place.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.720]   But what happens if the Sun is displaced and
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.720]   Mars, the planet Mars,
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:15.280]   becomes the center? What happens is that when you try to draw the orbits of the planets,
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:22.720]   when you try to understand the other realities in your life, when God has been replaced by Mars as
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.160]   the center,
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:31.400]   things look terrifyingly chaotic. They're out of order and surely
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:38.040]   Mercury is going to crash into our planet. It is. It is. Just look at this orbit.
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:41.560]   In other words, the root problem
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:46.800]   with disordered thinking is that the center has been removed.
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:50.080]   The Sun doesn't function as a massive
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:57.600]   gravitational force in our minds anymore and that can't be addressed by telling them that the orbit of
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:05.200]   Mercury is not going to crash into the earth because from their standpoint with Mars in the place of the Sun, it is. Just look.
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:08.600]   There it is. I've drawn it on paper. It's going to happen.
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:13.800]   Our whole effort seems to me needs to be by prayer and
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:21.200]   teaching to try to reawaken a God-centered universe of thought in their mind and a
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:26.720]   God-centered solar system of well-ordered affections for God and his
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:29.240]   central biblical
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:34.400]   realities. Now, I can't deal with the mark of the beast. That's what she wanted me to do. Secondly,
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:40.360]   like that tell me what the mark of the beast is, but here's how I think about it. And I think this is
[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:47.120]   just as important. The mark of the beast is a sign from in the book of Revelation that you have
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.600]   forsaken the Lord Jesus and worshiped a false deity.
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:54.360]   It keeps you from having to be persecuted.
[00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.880]   It gets you privileges.
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:04.200]   This sign that you have forsaken Jesus and embraced an alien deity gets you privileges in a culture of
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:08.600]   anti-christian forces where they hold sway. And the way to victory in
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:16.320]   that culture is described in Revelation 12 11. They have conquered Satan, who's the power behind the beast.
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:22.600]   They have conquered Satan by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony,
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:29.200]   for they love not their lives even unto death. So what will we devote ourselves to?
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:34.560]   Fascination with the number and the name of the mark of the beast, which is not of the essence,
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:41.440]   or with an understanding of and a love for the blood of the Lamb and
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:48.920]   the readiness to bear public witness to his greatness and a willingness to sacrifice our lives because of his supreme value.
[00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:54.920]   Once that question is settled, will we operate from Christ's glorious central
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:10:02.040]   realities or will we dabble at the margins? Once that question is settled in our hearts,
[00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:09.920]   then we can calmly go about studying. What is the number of the beast? But when the center is missing,
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:17.600]   dabbling at the edges of numbers and names is not going to satisfy or help. The main thing is not
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.880]   identifying that
[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:26.760]   mark. The main thing is loving Christ so deeply we are ready to die for him as
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:31.800]   we depend on his redeeming blood. His infinite, all-satisfying
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:38.760]   value is the sun that keeps the planets of our thoughts and affections in order.
[00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:45.800]   Amen. Riveting our attention on the greatest glories and not getting carried away by the lesser and marginal details. That's an important word.
