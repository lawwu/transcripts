[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.360]   Well, does depression disqualify a pastor?
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.960]   It's a serious question.
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.880]   It's a very heavy question and it comes to us from a podcast listener named Kyle.
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:15.880]   Hello Pastor John.
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:23.200]   At what point, if any, does depression and/or joylessness disqualify an elder?
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.120]   Or when might these become reasons for an elder to step down out of a desire to most
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.440]   wisely serve his congregation?
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.160]   What would you say to Kyle, Pastor John?
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:41.480]   Let me begin by affirming that Kyle is right to suggest that there is a point at which
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.320]   joylessness does disqualify an elder.
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.000]   A lot of people don't think of that.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.800]   So he's right to point this out.
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.280]   But we have to be so careful here because joy is subjective.
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.200]   It's a subjective reality.
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.840]   It's no less real and no less important for that.
[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.760]   But it manifests itself in various ways.
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.560]   It manifests itself in degrees of presence.
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.560]   And so putting our finger on it is not easy.
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:20.920]   And so I think we should be slow and careful before we declare anybody unqualified for
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.160]   their ministry because of it.
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:30.120]   So let me just point to, I don't know, three or four things that Kyle might take into consideration
[00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.680]   as he ponders this or the rest of us.
[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.860]   Number one, Hebrews 13, 17 says, "Obey your leaders, submit to them for they are keeping
[00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.240]   watch over your souls as those who will have to give an account.
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.540]   Let them do this with joy."
[00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:53.680]   So let your leaders lead, let your pastor and elders lead with joy, not with groaning,
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.800]   for that would be of no advantage to you.
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:08.960]   In other words, a chronically joyless pastor is of no advantage, no benefit to his people,
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:15.240]   which means there comes a point where for the people's sake, he should step down or
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.960]   step back.
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.000]   So this is just to say, Kyle, thank you for taking this seriously.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.420]   Hebrews 13, 17 says so.
[00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:32.280]   Number two, there are two places where Paul says that his whole ministry is devoted to
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.480]   the joy of his people.
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.120]   Second Corinthians 1.24, "Not that we lord it over your faith, but we work with you for
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.920]   your joy."
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.000]   And Philippians 1.25, "I know that I will remain and continue with you all for your
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.480]   progress and joy of the faith."
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.840]   So that was Paul's apostolic mission, to seek the joy of other people.
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.920]   And I think it's the calling on every pastor and every elder to work for the joy of their
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.380]   people.
[00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:07.520]   And if their own inability to rejoice in the Lord hinders that, there may come a time when
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.160]   they are not able to fulfill that calling.
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:21.400]   Third, the pastor and elder who aim to help their people obey the Lord will need to help
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:27.440]   them rejoice in tribulation, because that's what it says in Romans 5.3.
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.380]   We rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance and endurance
[00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.760]   produces character, character produces hope, and hope does not put us to shame because
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.760]   the love of God is poured out in our hearts.
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:46.960]   So elders are called to be examples to the flock, 1 Peter 5, and if we can't rejoice
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:55.120]   in our own sufferings, like Romans 5.3 says, how are we going to help our people obey the
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.440]   scriptures, that is, fulfill our calling, to set an example for them and help them?
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:08.700]   One last illustration of how this works, 2 Corinthians 8, 1 and 2.
[00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.380]   We want you to know, brothers, about the grace of God that was given among the churches of
[00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:22.580]   Macedonia, for in a severe test of affliction, their abundance of joy and their extreme poverty
[00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.580]   have overflowed in a wealth of generosity.
[00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:31.240]   Now what that text says is that love that is overflowing in a wealth of generosity to
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:40.200]   those in need around us, love is the overflow of abundance of joy in God, not joy in overcoming
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:46.700]   poverty, not joy in escaping affliction, because both of those are mentioned right there alongside
[00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:47.700]   joy.
[00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:54.120]   So an elder who wants his people to love other people, that is to overflow in joy for them
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.400]   in the midst of affliction, in the midst of poverty, has to be able to set the example
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.340]   for that himself.
[00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:10.520]   So here are a few concluding observations that might help Kyle and others find some
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.880]   guidance of when to step down or when to step back.
[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:20.480]   Number one, be sure to distinguish between a temporary dullness of spirit and a growing
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.360]   bitterness of spirit.
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:28.400]   Both dullness and bitterness can rob us of joy, but what a world of difference.
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:36.480]   Dullness may mean we're wrestling with nature, something in our bodies or in our circumstances.
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:41.800]   Bitterness means that we're giving in to sin and the people know the difference.
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.360]   They'll taste the difference.
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:50.840]   The broken hearted pastor who's in a season of dullness will cry out to God affectionately
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:57.200]   for his mercy and many of his people will deeply appreciate his cry.
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.400]   They'll resonate with it.
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:05.660]   They'll be thankful for an honest, heartfelt cry from their pastor's soul to God.
[00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:11.640]   But the pastor who is giving in to joylessness out of anger and bitterness, he does nobody
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.040]   any good.
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:20.000]   Number two, seek to discern the roots of your loss of joy.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:27.820]   If there is hidden sin, for example, it will definitely rob a pastor of his spiritual delights
[00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:28.900]   in God.
[00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.900]   No pastor should tolerate that in his own soul.
[00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.320]   He should make war on his sin.
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:40.560]   And if he can't get the victory, then he needs to draw his elders into it with him, his fellow
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.080]   elders and confess his need for help.
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:51.340]   But there may be other hard things besides sin that his elders see, and they're going
[00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:56.600]   to cut him a lot of slack here while they help him get through this season.
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:04.460]   Third suggestion, a key question is whether you can still preach the tone of the text
[00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:13.820]   in your loss of joy, or is your own emotional state such that it controls all of your demeanor?
[00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:14.820]   Here's what I mean.
[00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:22.280]   I found over the decades of preaching that even though my private life at times was filled
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:31.040]   with sorrow, real heartache, and I had to preach the next Sunday, I found that the text
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:39.820]   really did in that moment create its own emotions in me that were real and authentic.
[00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:40.980]   Can you still do that?
[00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:42.820]   Can that happen for you?
[00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:44.320]   This is not hypocrisy.
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:47.020]   This is not fake it till you make it.
[00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:54.220]   This is a real supernatural experience of emotion by the Holy Spirit wrought by that
[00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:57.380]   text in the hour of preaching.
[00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:01.440]   And just two more possible suggestions.
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:09.180]   Another key question is, are you able still to feel sweet affection for your people?
[00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:11.060]   Do they sense that?
[00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:20.300]   If so, your season of darkness may be a balm to them because they will know that your affection
[00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:23.740]   is rooted in your confidence in the gospel.
[00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:31.700]   And the last thing I would say is how long has the struggle of seeming darkness or dullness
[00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:34.320]   or heaviness, joylessness gone on?
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.900]   That matters.
[00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:42.820]   And out of all those five suggestions there at the end, out of all those questions, the
[00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:49.700]   answer might be that you would ask for a sabbatical, or it might be that you'd seek help in some
[00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:50.700]   other way.
[00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:57.900]   It might be that resignation from the eldership would be a last resort.
[00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:04.700]   And I think it should be a last resort, especially for the vocational elder whose resignation
[00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:07.980]   would be a huge upheaval for the people.
[00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:14.660]   So share your struggle with a trusted friend and see whether what I've said here or other
[00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:20.820]   things they might point out, whether that gives you wisdom for this season.
[00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:22.340]   Very good and careful words, Pastor John.
[00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:23.340]   Thank you.
[00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:28.580]   And we talked about the dark season that you faced, a midlife crisis of sorts back in episode
[00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:30.380]   1173.
[00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:36.820]   My Midlife Crisis and Counsel for Yours is a great episode, 1173 in the archive.
[00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:42.100]   And Hebrews 13, 17 is such a rich passage and that has come up several times in the
[00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:43.100]   APJ archives.
[00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:45.020]   Here's just a few examples.
[00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:49.980]   It came up in episode 1143 to discourage pastors and their wives.
[00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:54.900]   It also appeared in episode 433, should I commit to one church?
[00:09:54.900 --> 00:10:01.420]   And also in episode 297, do podcast preachers make my pastor irrelevant?
[00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:05.380]   All three of those episodes, Hebrews 13, 17 comes up.
