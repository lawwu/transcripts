[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.520]   - So you've done a lot of exciting research,
[00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.780]   design, engineering on spacesuits.
[00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.940]   What does the spacesuit of the future look like?
[00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:12.360]   - Well, if I have anything to say about it,
[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.100]   it'll be a very tight-fitting suit.
[00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.700]   We use mechanical counterpressure
[00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.900]   to pressurize right directly on the skin.
[00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.700]   Seems that it's technically feasible.
[00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.220]   We're still at the research and development stage.
[00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.540]   We don't have a flight system,
[00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:24.820]   but technically it's feasible,
[00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.740]   so we do a lot of work in the materials.
[00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.220]   What materials do we need to pressurize someone?
[00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.580]   What's the patterning we need?
[00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:31.620]   That's what our patents are in,
[00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.700]   the patterning, kind of how we apply this.
[00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.300]   It's a third of an atmosphere.
[00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.100]   - Just to sort of take a little step back,
[00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.460]   you have this incredible bio suit
[00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.100]   where it's tight-fitting,
[00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.260]   so it allows more mobility and so on.
[00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.100]   So maybe even to take a bigger step back,
[00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.300]   like what are the functions that a spacesuit should perform?
[00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.460]   - Sure, so start from the beginning.
[00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.140]   A spacesuit is the world's smallest spacecraft.
[00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.320]   So I really, that's the best definition I can give you.
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.100]   Right now we fly gas-pressurized suits,
[00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.100]   but think of developing and designing an entire spacecraft.
[00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.620]   So then you take all those systems
[00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.460]   and you shrink them around a person,
[00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:04.900]   provide them with oxygen debris,
[00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.100]   scrub out their carbon dioxide,
[00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.980]   make sure they have pressure.
[00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.560]   They need a pressure environment to live in.
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.900]   So really the spacesuit is a shrunken spacecraft
[00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.580]   in its entirety, has all the same systems.
[00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:16.980]   - Communication as well, probably.
[00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.280]   - Yeah, communications, exactly.
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.920]   So you really, thermal control,
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.780]   little bit of radiation, not so much radiation protection,
[00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.860]   but thermal control, humidity, oxygen debris.
[00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.580]   So all those life support systems
[00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.500]   as well as the pressure production.
[00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.380]   So it's an engineering marvel,
[00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.380]   the spacesuits that have flown
[00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.260]   because they really are entire spacecraft,
[00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.900]   that is small spacecraft that we have around a person,
[00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.620]   but they're very massive,
[00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.820]   but 140 kilos the current suit,
[00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.220]   and they're not mobility suits.
[00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.900]   So since we're going back to the moon and Mars,
[00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.340]   we need a planetary suit, we need a mobility suit.
[00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.520]   So that's where we've kind of flipped the design paradigm.
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.500]   I study astronauts, I study humans in motion,
[00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.100]   and if we can map that motion,
[00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.580]   I wanna give you full flexibility,
[00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:56.980]   move your arms and legs.
[00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.500]   I really want you to be like a Olympic athlete,
[00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.340]   an extreme explorer.
[00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.100]   I don't wanna waste any of your energy,
[00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.980]   so we take it from the human design.
[00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.380]   So I take a look at humans,
[00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.900]   we measure them, we model them,
[00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.820]   and then I say, "Okay, can I put a spacesuit on them
[00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.060]   "that goes from the skin out?"
[00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.300]   So rather than a gas pressurized shrinking
[00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.660]   that spacecraft around the person,
[00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.200]   say, "Here's how humans perform.
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.860]   "Can I design a spacesuit literally from the skin out?"
[00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.500]   So that's what we've come up with,
[00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.260]   mechanical counterpressure, some patterning,
[00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.140]   and that way it could be order of magnitude less
[00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.860]   in terms of the mass,
[00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.420]   and it should provide maximum mobility for Moon or Mars.
[00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.940]   - What's mechanical counterpressure?
[00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.740]   Like, how the heck can you even begin
[00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.380]   to create something that's tight-fitting?
[00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.860]   And still doesn't protect you from the elements and so on,
[00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.740]   and the whole pressure thing?
[00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.500]   - That's the challenge, it's a big design challenge.
[00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.620]   We've been working on it for a while.
[00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.180]   So you can either put someone in a balloon,
[00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.680]   that's one way to do it, that's conventional,
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.520]   that's the only thing we've ever done.
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.340]   - What's that mean?
[00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.180]   That means the balloon that you fill with gas?
[00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.000]   - That's a gas pressurized suit.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.840]   So if you put someone in a balloon,
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.460]   it's only a third of an atmosphere to keep someone alive.
[00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:58.620]   So that's what the current system is.
[00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.180]   So depending on what units you think,
[00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.100]   in 30 kilopascals, 4.3 pounds per square inch.
[00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.020]   - So much less than the pressure that's on Earth.
[00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.580]   You can still keep a human alive with 0.3,
[00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.380]   and it's alive and happy.
[00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.620]   - Alive and happy, and you mix the gases.
[00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.540]   Do you need, here, we're having this chat,
[00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.340]   and we're at one sea level in Boston at one atmosphere.
[00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:20.180]   But a suit--
[00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.260]   - Oxygen and nitrogen.
[00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.140]   - Oxygen and nitrogen, and you put a suit,
[00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.680]   if we put someone to a third of an atmosphere,
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.320]   so for mechanical counter pressure now,
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.240]   so one way is to do it with a balloon,
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.680]   and that's what we currently have.
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.920]   Or you can apply the pressure directly to the skin.
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.480]   I only have to give you a third of an atmosphere.
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.360]   Right now, you and I are very happy in one atmosphere.
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.300]   So if I put that pressure, a third of an atmosphere on you,
[00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.360]   I just have to do it consistently,
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.400]   across all of your body and your limbs,
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.600]   and it'll be a gas pressurized helmet.
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.000]   Doesn't make sense to shrink wrap the head.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.840]   See the blue man group?
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.520]   That's a great act.
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.360]   But we don't need to,
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.840]   there's no benefits of shrink wrapping the head.
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.920]   You put a gas pressurized helmet,
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.160]   because the helmet, then, the future of suits,
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.000]   you asked me about,
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.480]   the helmet just becomes your information portal.
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.240]   So it will have augmented reality.
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.180]   It'll have all the information you need.
[00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.880]   Should have the maps that I need.
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:10.800]   I'm on the moon.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.560]   Okay, well, hey, smart helmet.
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.720]   Then show me the map, show me the topography.
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.400]   Hopefully it has the lab embedded, too.
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.000]   If it has really great cameras,
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.400]   maybe I can see with that regolith.
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.880]   That's just lunar dust and dirt.
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.000]   What's that made out of?
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.320]   We talked about the water.
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.360]   So the helmet, then, really becomes this information portal,
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.620]   is how I see the IT architecture of the helmet,
[00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:34.620]   is really allowing me to use all of my modalities
[00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.360]   of an explorer that I'd like to.
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.880]   So cameras, voiceover, images.
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:39.700]   If it were really good,
[00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.080]   it would have lab capabilities, as well.
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.040]   - Okay, so the pressure comes from the body,
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.320]   comes from the mechanical pressure, which is fascinating.
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.720]   Now, what aspect, when I look at bio-suit,
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.320]   just the suits you're working on,
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.480]   sort of from a fashion perspective, they look awesome.
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.560]   Is that a small part of it, too?
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.040]   - Oh, absolutely, 'cause the teams that we work with,
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.320]   of course, I'm an engineer, there's engineering students,
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.120]   there's design students, there's architects.
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.640]   So it really is very much a multidisciplinary team.
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.280]   So sure, colors, aesthetics, materials,
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.760]   all those things we pay attention to.
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.760]   So it's not just an engineering solution.
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.760]   It really is a much more holistic, it's a suit.
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.280]   It's a suit, you're dressed in a suit now.
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.560]   It's a form-fitting.
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.120]   So we really have to pay attention to all those things.
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.280]   And so that's the design team that we work with.
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.040]   And my partner, Ghetradi, we're partners in this,
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.280]   in terms of, he comes from an architecture,
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.920]   industrial design background.
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.940]   So bringing those skills to bear, as well.
[00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.400]   We team up with industry folks
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.840]   who are in athletic performance and designers.
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.320]   So it really is a team
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.120]   that brings all those skills together.
[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.780]   - So what role does the spacesuit play
[00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.160]   in our long-term staying in Mars,
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.040]   sort of exploring the,
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.440]   doing all the work that astronauts do,
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.280]   but also perhaps civilians one day,
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.940]   almost like taking steps towards colonization of Mars?
[00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:59.560]   What role does a spacesuit play there?
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.200]   - So you always need a life support system,
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.260]   pressurized habitat.
[00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.280]   And I like to say, we're not going to Mars to sit around.
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:07.960]   So you need a suit.
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.000]   Even if you land and have the lander,
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.560]   you're not going there to stay inside.
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:12.400]   That's for darn sure.
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.040]   We're going there to search for the evidence of life.
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.220]   That's why we're going to Mars.
[00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:16.880]   So you need a lot of mobility.
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.200]   So for me, the suit is the best way
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.720]   to give the human mobility.
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.360]   We're always still going to need rovers.
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.520]   We're going to need robots.
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:27.240]   So for me, exploration is always a suite of explorers.
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.080]   Some people are going to,
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.680]   some of the suite of explorers are humans,
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.860]   but many are going to be robots, smart systems,
[00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:33.700]   things like that.
[00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:36.320]   But I look at it as kind of all those capabilities together
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.980]   make the best exploration team.
[00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:42.980]   [Silence]
[00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:47.980]   [Silence]
[00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:52.980]   [Silence]
[00:06:52.980 --> 00:07:02.980]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
