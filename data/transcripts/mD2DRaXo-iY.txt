[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.360]   - There was a moment when doctors told John Piper
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.140]   that they detected cancer in his body.
[00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.000]   Thankfully, it was a treatable cancer,
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.820]   but in that moment in the hospital
[00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.860]   when a doctor first voiced concern
[00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.280]   and Pastor John was left alone in a room,
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.200]   there in that moment without a Bible at hand,
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.200]   here were the first truths that flooded to his mind,
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.880]   as John Piper explained in a 2006 sermon.
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.800]   - 2 Corinthians 1.8, almost one of the first ones.
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.640]   I don't want you to be ignorant, brothers,
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.640]   concerning the affliction that we endured in Asia Minor.
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.920]   We felt that we had been given the sentence of death.
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.880]   That was to make us rely not upon ourselves,
[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.700]   but upon God who raises the dead.
[00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.040]   Now, there are a thousand good purposes
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.840]   in what God is doing in me right now, a thousand plus.
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.080]   I don't know 99% of them, but I know one of them,
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:14.920]   helping me not rely upon myself
[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.200]   and helping me rely upon the God who raises the dead.
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.600]   That's the purpose.
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.480]   I don't need the other 999.
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.760]   That's just enough.
[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.480]   He's good, he's wise, the therapy is tailor-made
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.440]   for my need right now by God.
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.560]   That's number one.
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.600]   Number two, how sweet.
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.240]   1 Thessalonians 5, 9, and 10.
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.380]   Comes to me in a dark moment.
[00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.720]   I can't remember morning or evening.
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.720]   God has not destined you for wrath,
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.520]   but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.640]   who died for us so that whether we wake or sleep,
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.560]   we will live with him.
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.280]   Don't you love biblical clarity?
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.160]   I mean, it just is golden clarity.
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.040]   You tap that one and it rings clear.
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.280]   There are no ambiguities in that verse.
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.280]   John Piper, God says, "You are not destined for wrath."
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:32.120]   This is not wrath, but for salvation
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.320]   through Jesus Christ, not you, not you, you're nobody.
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.640]   You're a sinner, through Jesus Christ who died for you
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.640]   so that whether you're taken out at 60 or get 80,
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.660]   you're gonna live with him.
[00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.660]   Those are, that's why I want you to read your Bible.
[00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:58.940]   I was with six guys down in Louisville, Kentucky,
[00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.100]   praying and strategizing about big things the last few days
[00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.900]   and shared this with them.
[00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.900]   And we were talking about postmodern post-propositionalism
[00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.820]   and how bad it is.
[00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.660]   And I got real animated in Al Mohler's basement
[00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.740]   and almost broke a vase.
[00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:31.220]   And I said, "Okay, when I stand up at this Together
[00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.180]   for the Gospel Conference and talk about this,
[00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.400]   I'm gonna say,
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:43.660]   'God has not destined me for wrath,
[00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.300]   but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ
[00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.300]   who died for me so that whether I die or live,
[00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.340]   I live with him.'"
[00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.260]   Don't take my propositions!
[00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.700]   These people, these postmodern emergent types
[00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.940]   think they're just moving beyond
[00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.660]   this enlightenment propositionalism.
[00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.860]   I say, "Well, I don't know where you're going,
[00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.420]   but I know a few propositions that I will live by,
[00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.220]   die by, and this is one of them,
[00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.260]   and there are about 18,000 others in the Bible.
[00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.140]   Don't get uppity about post-propositionalism.
[00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.860]   I will have propositions like,
[00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:30.260]   "You are not destined for wrath."
[00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:35.540]   That's a statement with a verb and a subject
[00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.420]   and a few other grammatical pieces
[00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.700]   that matter infinitely to me.
[00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.820]   I get really exercised about this stuff,
[00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:50.100]   this philosophical mumbo jumbo about how new everything is
[00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.260]   because we're going beyond the doctrines
[00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.620]   and beyond the propositions.
[00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.460]   Thank you, I don't know where you're going,
[00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.020]   but I'm staying right here with verses nine and 10
[00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.500]   of 1 Thessalonians.
[00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.900]   - Amen, and for more on this,
[00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.500]   see Piper's article titled,
[00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.020]   "10 Lessons from a Hospital Bed,"
[00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:14.020]   published at DesiringGod.org on April 8th, 2014.
[00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.140]   This clip was pulled from Piper's 2006 sermon,
[00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:20.380]   "How God's Word Produces Our Work."
[00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.700]   It was a clip sent in by podcast listener,
[00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.700]   Ricky Sanchez from Toronto, Canada.
[00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.860]   Of course, Piper's cancer was treatable.
[00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.760]   Tomorrow, we address a heartbreaking email
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.340]   from a teenager with terminal cancer
[00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.020]   who wants to know, "When is it okay to pray
[00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.740]   "that God would take us home?"
[00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.260]   I'm your host Tony Reinhke, and I'll see you tomorrow.
[00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.500]   (silence)
[00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.660]   (silence)
[00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:54.660]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
