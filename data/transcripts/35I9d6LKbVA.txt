[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120]   I don't feel like I care about flying in a private jet, like as far as if you think of like,
[00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.880]   if you could have unlimited money, what would you do? There's not that many different things.
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.720]   I realize I speak from a place of privilege right now, but there's not that many more
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.600]   things that I think my money is worth doing anything that I don't enjoy doing to get.
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.080]   And so should I, if I didn't like doing this job, should I keep doing it? No,
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.040]   I should stop doing it. Should my wife do her job if she doesn't like it? No,
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.800]   like we should stop doing the things because we're in a place that we can.
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:37.040]   Um, and I think I've been able to not care as much about money as I did, but that doesn't help.
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.120]   But that actually means you're mentally rich. Yeah. That's what I'm hearing.
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:48.720]   Yeah. I, I, I feel like I'm not, I used to feel mentally poor and I don't feel that way anymore.
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.160]   So the congratulations, you have become, you have, you have, you have, you have defeated
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:58.000]   the poverty in your brain because the minute you stop caring about money or fearing about money,
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.080]   then you are mentally rich and you're living life the way you life is supposed to be lived
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.560]   without worrying or thinking about money. Hello, and welcome to all the hacks, a show
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.680]   about upgrading your life, money, and travel. My guest today is none other than Nassir Yassin,
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.880]   better known online as Nas Daily. He's traveled to dozens of countries that many of us have never
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.600]   been to, or even heard of, and he's captivated millions worldwide with his daily one minute
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.960]   videos that bring to life the stories of people from every corner of the globe. He has over 60
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.920]   million followers and his videos have been viewed more than 20 billion times. Now I've gotten to
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.400]   know him over the past few years after he made a pretty incredible video about me and credit
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.720]   card points that I'll link to below. And I'm quite confident it'll make you smile.
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.440]   We're going to talk about how travel can broaden our perspective on life and how it can also help
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.840]   us save money along the way. And while our conversation touches a lot on travel related
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.800]   topics, like the best ways to engage with local communities, underrated countries to visit,
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.200]   or why he always stays in hostels in a new country, we're also going to talk a bit about
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.520]   personal development and self-discovery. I'm really excited for this conversation,
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.840]   but before we jump in, if you could give us a thumbs up, it'd really help the algorithm.
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.600]   And if you're new here, please consider subscribing. Okay, let's do it.
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:20.240]   Thanks for being here. Chris, thank you for having me.
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.680]   I think not that many people that I meet have a thing they really passionately believe in
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.320]   that needs to change about the world. What would you say is your kind of life mission
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.400]   or what you want to bring to the table? Oh, wow. Damn, you're starting strong.
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:41.920]   So first of all, I think if you have, imagine if you're an alien and you come to planet earth,
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.240]   okay? You just come into planet earth for the first time ever, and we introduce you to planet
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.280]   earth. Some of the things that we're doing for the last 30, 40, 50 years, I'm pretty damn sure
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:57.040]   the alien would be shocked by what we do and be like, there's no way you're doing this. So
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:04.160]   an example of that is we built a very tall building and then we put a desk and a chair
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.840]   and we force somebody to sit in that desk and chair for 13 hours every day,
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:14.000]   like 50 meters, 500 meters above the ground in a suit and a rope around their neck.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:22.800]   And also we walk around with a rope around our neck, the tie. Like really,
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.720]   what, why do you have a rope around your neck? So that's fundamentally something's off with it.
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:33.600]   Or like the idea that we, what are some of the crazy stuff that we do?
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:40.800]   The idea that you can only do what you really like when you're 67, when you're like 70% done
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:46.320]   with your life or 80% done with your life, then you can get the freedom you want. That
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:52.480]   sounds like ridiculous, right? Or the idea that we're forcing high schoolers and middle school
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.520]   students to spend the first 18 years of their lives, literally sitting in a classroom, bored
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:03.040]   out of their minds. The first 18 years of your life, society literally imprisons you in a school
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:08.720]   system that is not the most efficient. That's crazy, don't you think? So anyway, oh, another
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.680]   thing that's crazy we do. We kill each other because we disagree on something that happened
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:19.600]   2000 years ago, like crusaders and the Shia and the Muslims. And because of that, we kill each
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.240]   other. And oh, a piece of land, we also disagree on the name of a piece of land. And I'm willing
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.200]   to literally end your life because this land is mine and it's not yours. A lot of these things
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:35.440]   for an alien sound ridiculous. And for us, it's daily life. And I think my mission statement in
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:42.160]   life is to recognize what needs to change on planet earth and like spend the rest of my life
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.200]   contributing to that. And so that's why my mission statement is, you know, bring people together.
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:54.720]   I'm from Israel and Palestine and that's a crazy thing. So I'd like to help in that regard. I'd
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:00.880]   like to help get people to spend less time wearing ropes around their neck. I'd like people to stop
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.600]   killing each other because they're a different color or shade over an eye or whatever. That's my
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:10.800]   that's my life statement. And what do you think you can do or anyone listening can do to try to
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:16.640]   further that? I think it's a noble goal that I would hope that my audience is not. It's not like,
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:22.640]   oh, that guy, that horrible idea of bringing people together. I found and please tell me
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:27.760]   what you think. Actually, I want to get your opinion on this because I'm I like you. I'm also
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:36.960]   like, I think most change starts with media. I don't know if that's right or wrong, but most
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:42.400]   real change in the world starts with just making better media information, better information.
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.400]   That's why whenever a dictator comes to a country, what is the first thing that they do?
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.600]   They stop the radio, they stop the TV, they take control of the newspapers. So the flow of
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:56.640]   information, if you change the flow of information, you change the flow of the way humans think. If
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:02.160]   you change the way humans think, you change the world. What would you do? I think that it's very
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:09.600]   hard for people to see someone else's perspective without understanding it. The media is able to
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:14.240]   just show us the perspective that we believe in and we agree with and all that. If people could
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:20.480]   just kind of go spend some time with other people who live different lives in an open-minded way,
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:24.160]   I think they have to be open-minded. And so I think you can bring people together,
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.560]   but you also have to get them to be a little bit more open-minded.
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.080]   So it seems like it starts with media, but also ends with travel.
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.520]   Yeah. So I think that's why I love travel. That's why I encourage people to go places.
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.640]   I don't know how to solve this problem. I haven't thought about this problem as much as you have,
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:40.640]   but I just don't think people get to see that perspective enough and traveling has helped me
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:44.640]   see it. Which is why I love traveling, which is why I love encouraging travel, which I love talking
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:48.480]   about it. I love helping people save money so they can spend money on things they want to do.
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:56.800]   Yeah. I mean, I think travel humanizes humans. And I think far too often we look at somebody
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:03.760]   in North Korea as a not human. You are just a North Korean. It's like you don't view them as
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:08.800]   human and you can kill what you don't humanize. And when you humanize somebody, you cannot kill
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:13.360]   them. And that's why- And not even kill, I mean, yes, physically, but also just like
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:17.280]   destroy their ideas, destroy their beliefs. Yes, everything about them.
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:21.760]   In all ways. That's why people don't want to eat their dog, because the dog is humanized to them.
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:26.720]   Oh, my dog has feelings. My dog loves me. But they're okay to kill a cow that they've never
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:33.520]   seen because it's not a human. So I guess the more we humanize everything in life, the kinder
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.440]   the world will become. Now you said kind.
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:39.040]   I didn't say nice. You did not say nice. Tell me about why.
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:46.480]   You had like a light bulb. Would you say you're a nice guy?
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:53.440]   Having seen a video of you talk about this, I will restrain myself from answering that question.
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:59.840]   No, I think kindness is important. I don't think niceness is. And maybe this is because I was born
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:04.400]   and raised in Israel, which there's a term in Israel called chutzpah. You know what chutzpah
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:10.000]   means? I couldn't define it, but I've kind of heard it used. I know how to use it more than
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.400]   I know how to define it. It's almost like bluntness or like rudeness, straightforwardness.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:19.360]   It's like, I'm just going to say whatever I want to say. I'm going to be truthful. And I'm going
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:27.120]   to say it even at the expense of you feeling uncomfortable. And I think niceness means
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:36.560]   not doing what you really want to do because you are limited by the fear of offending someone else.
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:44.400]   So to be nice, you change who you are to suit somebody else, even if you're not being truthful
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:51.040]   to yourself. Does that make sense? So that's why I think this whole idea is like, you have to be
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:56.080]   nice. I don't necessarily agree with it. I think you have to be yourself. I'll give you an example
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:01.360]   from like work. I have two types of people that I work with, a person that is not nice to me,
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:05.760]   but every time I talk to them and they report to me, every time I talk to them, they tell me
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:11.040]   exactly how they feel. When I look at their face, when they say you're a horrible CEO or you're a
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:16.240]   great CEO, I can pretty much guess that they mean what they say because they're not being nice.
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:21.760]   They're being upfront and kind, but they're being themselves. The other type of person would be
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:26.880]   like, I love this job. I love this company. I love you. Right. But, but behind your back,
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:30.800]   they're like really not happy with you, but they're trying to be nice to you.
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:39.040]   I think that's the ultimate form of betrayal is being nice to someone when you don't actually
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:43.920]   mean it just because you want to be nice. So I have many problems with the word nice.
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:50.480]   And I'd much rather have people be kind, but like super upfront, say what you want to say.
[00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:53.600]   And if it comes at the expense of somebody hating you, then so be it.
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:58.160]   Have you found any tactics in a culture like America where this is not okay,
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:02.720]   or it's less societally acceptable? An example I'll give where I've been
[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:08.400]   not nice, but, but purely kind is, I can't remember the circumstances.
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.000]   By the way, you are too nice. I noticed.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.360]   I might be too nice, but there was a moment where my wife and I are at,
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:16.160]   we're talking to someone and they were like, we should get together sometime.
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:17.200]   And you said yes?
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:23.920]   No, no. And almost everyone listening, I'm sure if they met another couple or friends and they said,
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:27.280]   oh, we should get together sometime. You'd be like, yeah, let's, let's see if it'll work.
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:31.680]   And I remember saying, look, things are really busy. We have a lot going on. I just don't think
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:36.240]   it makes sense to try to plan something like let's not plan something. I didn't say like,
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:39.120]   I don't want to see you again. Like it was, I was not trying to be unkind.
[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:40.480]   That was with another couple of friends.
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:44.480]   This is just like the people we met, like maybe it was at a park and some kids and the parents
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:47.680]   are like, oh, should we do? I don't remember the context. It was before kids. Actually,
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:52.560]   it was years ago. But, um, I think I was just like, look, I knew that we weren't gonna actually
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:56.480]   want, like, there's only so many people you can have in your life and spend time with. And how
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:59.840]   do you want to prioritize? I was like, I just don't think this meets the bar for what I want
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:03.840]   to spend my time on. And at work it's, I've gotten better at replying to people back.
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:07.760]   I don't have time for this meeting. Really appreciate it. I'm focused on other stuff.
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:11.040]   If it could be accomplished via email, send me an email. Otherwise, you know,
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:14.240]   feel free to reach out, you know, down the road and we'll see if I have time.
[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:18.000]   Uh, I'm trying to protect the Maldives, me and you. And I definitely don't want to go to the
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.040]   Maldives with you. Like of all the things that I could do with the limited amount of time I have
[00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:26.800]   and, and either if it's without kids, it's too far. And if it's with kids,
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:31.440]   it's not going to be what I want. It's not fun. Um, and so conceptually, I do want to go to the
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:34.960]   Maldives with you. Like if you could create the, yeah, but, but practically, no, I do not want to
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:40.960]   go to the Maldives. Thank you for being, uh, upfront. So, but I don't think people like that,
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:46.960]   you know, like, I think, I don't know. I love Israeli buntness. Like all my Israeli friends
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:50.320]   are like, you know, come over it's and they're like, Oh, why do you, why did you do that thing?
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:53.920]   That was dumb. And I was like, Oh yeah, you're right. It was dumb, but everyone else here is so
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:12:03.200]   nice. Um, so how do you survive with American trying to be less nice and not coming across
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:07.280]   as unkind? It's so funny that you think Americans are the nicest people on the planet.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.400]   Like when you get this idea that like the other questions, how do you survive with
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:18.160]   other nationalities that are 10 times nicer than Americans? You know? Um, like I'm trying to think
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:22.160]   who's like, uh, like, uh, like Japan, how do you survive in Japan, for example, where you're like,
[00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:27.440]   literally have to be nice. Uh, or else it's like, you know, society, there's so many societal
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:35.200]   expectations. I found Americans to be not that nice. I don't know why. I mean, there's a bit,
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:38.640]   like there's a bit of shallowness, which is like, Hey, how are you? What's up? Let's hang out. And
[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:45.120]   nobody actually means it. But if you look at the, the national discourse of Americans on Twitter
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:50.080]   and on the media, they're not nice to each other. They're like, they have a lot of freedom to be
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:54.880]   who they are and say what they want on a national level. Maybe on a personal level, they're trying
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:13:00.640]   to be nice, but on a, on a national, like, and there's a lot of nice people, uh, in like, uh,
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:06.000]   much nicer in Japan. And the national discourse is much nicer. So this is partly why I'm attracted
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:12.160]   to America because I actually don't view people as nice. I view them as a bit like Israel.
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:18.000]   Sometimes I think once my, my, my read is once you've humanized another person, Americans are
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.360]   nice. Uh, so like amongst friends, you're like, Hey, do you want to get together? If someone
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:28.640]   doesn't want to get together with you, they're probably not going to say no. Right. Like that,
[00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:34.240]   that level of like nice. So you're not nice to strangers. Yeah. We're okay. Being not nice to
[00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:40.160]   strangers, but we were like over, over nice to colleagues and, and friends and family and that
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:48.960]   kind of stuff. Um, yeah. Okay. But you did say, do you want to be yourself? I think. Yes. And how
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:56.960]   important does being nice or let me ask this again. You said being nice can sometimes get in the way
[00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:03.200]   of acting who you, what you truly are and putting on a facade. How do you think people could be,
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:08.400]   or do you think people should be more themselves and how do they do that? Well, it's just, I found
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:14.960]   out that, you know how there's some, there's like, um, there's a sixth sense for, for humans. We can
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:19.040]   sense, we can sense when somebody is being authentic and we can sense when somebody is not
[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:27.840]   being authentic. Right. Um, and I think, I think you just want to make sure everybody around you
[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:32.080]   knows that you're authentic because people just love authenticity. This is why you guys voted for
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:37.520]   Trump not to get political, but at least you can probably think that whatever Trump says,
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:43.760]   he actually believes whether you like it or not. Right. But the authenticity is so attractive
[00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:50.640]   about humans. And I think it's just like such an underrated feature that many people don't seem to
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:57.120]   grasp is the more authentic you look, which means the more you say what you really want to say,
[00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:02.160]   uh, it means you'll actually be loved. It's very counterintuitive. It's very counterintuitive
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:08.480]   because everybody is living in this act. We're all acting. You're smiling when you're supposed
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:11.200]   to smile. You're shaking hands when you're supposed to shake hands. You're putting a tie
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:15.520]   when you're supposed to wear a tie. We're all acting to each other until we die. But at some
[00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:20.080]   point you have to stop acting and just like be who you really are. You know, I once went to this
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:25.520]   conference in Switzerland. I'm not going to say the name of the conference, but man, it was the
[00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:31.680]   most boring thing I've seen in my life where everybody pretended to be interested in everything
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:36.080]   everybody else was saying. But I know for a fact, for a fact that deep down inside everybody was
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:40.400]   bored. But during the conversations were like, Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Great point. Great point. Well,
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:47.920]   I really love your suit. And it was, it was such an act that made me realize, um, this is not it.
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:53.440]   This is not it. Do you think people do that because they, they, they're afraid to be authentic,
[00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:57.040]   not because they're afraid of who they are, but because they're afraid other people will judge
[00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:01.440]   them? Yeah. I mean, you, you, you don't want to rock the boat. I mean, if you're making millions
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:04.960]   of dollars in Switzerland, you don't want to rock the boat. I mean, I'll be the nicest guy ever if
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:10.720]   I have a million dollars, you know, guaranteed out of it. Right. So I think there's too much to lose.
[00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:16.560]   And, uh, and that's why you have to be nice to each other. But when there's nothing to lose,
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:21.680]   then you become who you really are. And you see it when there is war. Oh, I have nothing to lose.
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:26.240]   Now I'll just go be myself. I can go loot. I can do whatever I want. But when you have a lot to
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:30.480]   lose, like, that's why like rich people's circles, everybody's so nice to each other because one
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:34.880]   mistake, you lose millions of dollars. So I think maybe the reason why we're nice is because we're
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:39.760]   scared of losing what we have already achieved. And I see it myself, you know, when I have something
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:45.200]   to lose, I'm actually a little bit nicer to others. I'm a little bit less myself. Now I've
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:49.920]   come to a point where if I lose everything, I still have some money in the bank, so I'm okay.
[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:57.280]   And that's why I think you see Elon Musk to be so himself so crazy, because he has nothing to lose.
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:01.840]   He has the world's money. That's it. Like I like what's the worst thing? He's never going to be
[00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:08.960]   homeless. So in a way, if your livelihood is on the line with what you're about to say, you're
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:12.800]   going to say the nicest thing ever. It's interesting. I talked to the, I don't know if you know Bill
[00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:21.280]   Perkins. He wrote a book called Die With Zero. And as an experiment, he decided to go get some
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:26.080]   really old clothes and go panhandle for a few days in, I can't remember what city he was in.
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:31.440]   And what he did was he realized, wow, if I just sit on the street and beg for money,
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:35.120]   I can make, I actually think it was a crazy amount of money. It was like $50,000 a year.
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:35.760]   Wow.
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:41.200]   And he was like, oh, so I'll never be homeless. I don't have anything to worry about. If everything
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:45.840]   gets taken away, I can go live on however much money I can make begging on the street.
[00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:52.080]   And it mentally got rid of that. I'm curious, most people listening here are not at the kind
[00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:57.040]   of wealth that they're getting millions of dollars in conferences in Switzerland. But
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:01.520]   they're kind of in this middle ground where they're probably not being their authentic self.
[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:05.360]   You've talked about having the courage to be disliked. And I think a lot of times in a
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:08.080]   conversation, someone's not willing to say something because they're like, oh, maybe
[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:13.360]   someone won't like it. Oh, maybe I'll offend someone, even though I really feel it. And I
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:17.600]   don't think that means intentionally trying to offend people. What would you tell someone who's
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:24.800]   like, hey, Nassir, how do I just be more me? I think people should aim to be disliked. And
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:29.600]   this is really counterintuitive. Again, very counterintuitive. Very. You should aim to be
[00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:37.760]   disliked. Because the way I've seen the world work is for every one person that dislikes you,
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:43.360]   there's an equivalent person on the other side of the world that loves you. And so the more
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:48.400]   somebody dislikes you, the more another person loves you. So it's a very polarizing thing.
[00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:54.400]   But if somebody doesn't dislike you, you know what that also means? Nobody actually loves you.
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:19:02.560]   And this is why most politicians in democracies end up with like 50/50 percent. Why is that?
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:08.160]   Because politicians need security and everything because there are people who really dislike them
[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:11.680]   and want to kill them. That's why they need security. And there are people who really
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:19.920]   love them and want to vote for them forever. And so I think people should aim to live life
[00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:25.520]   like a politician, which is have some people that clearly dislike the way you live life,
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:30.800]   but also on the other side, you'll have your people. And people are just attracted
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:37.520]   to big ideas, big opinions. They're attracted to people who are authentic. And, you know,
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:43.440]   I hate Gary Vee. Okay. Just to be very open about it. Like, I'm not a fan. I'm not a fan of the
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:51.440]   Gary Vee style. But he's a genius for doing it because that same style is why he has a die-hard
[00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:58.000]   fandom. And that's powerful. And I'm trying to emulate Gary Vee as much as I hate his style.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.560]   I'm trying to emulate by being who I am and get my fair share of haters. I think I have 30 million
[00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:09.520]   haters or so. But on the other side, I have, you know, 60, 70 million lovers. I love living like
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:14.320]   that. And does it make you happy? Very happy. That's probably the only thing that makes me
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:24.240]   happy is knowing how much I'm worth hating. Because it also means I'm worth loving for
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:30.960]   somebody else. It's because there's something to hate. I mean, you don't like anybody who lives
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:37.200]   life without being hated on is not somebody who's done any meaningful change. Most change comes with
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:41.760]   resistance. And if you are not getting resistance for your ideas and what you believe in and what
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:45.600]   you like and what you want to do in your career, then you're not pushing the envelope enough. And
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:51.120]   if you're not pushing the envelope enough, your life is inconsequential. That's how I think about
[00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:56.640]   it. Of course, these are very extreme thoughts. Yeah. Now, Chris, how many haters do you have?
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:01.040]   It's interesting. The thing that I think is both great and not great about podcasting
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:09.040]   is that there's no comment. There's no like it takes someone hearing me say my email address or
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:17.440]   going to a website. So good and bad. I get very little feedback. But I would say in the entire
[00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:24.400]   time I've done this. Well, over 1000 comments in the form of email or in social or anything,
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:34.640]   I think I've had one negative reaction by email and not a lot. So I think it's difficult with
[00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:39.600]   podcasts. If you are on like TikTok, I'm sure you'll get a lot more hate. Yeah, it's one thing
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:45.680]   that I think makes me not excited about trying to do more on social media. It's just like it seems
[00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:51.040]   like like my perspective on podcasting is a very positive place. People are like, oh, I don't like
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:55.920]   what you have to say. Let's listen to something else. And there's no easy way for them to be like,
[00:21:55.920 --> 00:22:00.960]   and I hate what you said. So they just don't. So let's use this as an opportunity. If anybody
[00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:06.480]   here listening to this has any issues with Chris, if you hate what I'm saying, just give me give me
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:12.560]   the as you would say, the gratitude of knowing that that people out there hate what I'm saying.
[00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:16.880]   So you're calling your audience to send you hate mail right now and you're giving them permission.
[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:20.960]   Only if they believe that. Yeah, only if they believe that. Yeah. Yeah. But I guess you got
[00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:25.200]   to balance that with if you also love, you know, if you love what I'm saying, you know,
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:30.240]   I got to get to get both. But I imagine that by this many minutes in, if they hate me,
[00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:34.800]   they've already gone somewhere else. It's so easy to read a tweet before you tune it out.
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:38.240]   It's so easy to watch, you know, a 30 second video before you tune it out.
[00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:45.120]   I think it's really hard in a podcast to get to the point that something the most controversial
[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:49.200]   thing is said. That's true. And there's no inherent virality. It's not like if we say
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:53.920]   something that is crazy, Apple is not going to like promote the episode because lots of people
[00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:58.880]   listen to it. That's just not how it works. Wow. So it's very easy with YouTube, with social media
[00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:03.280]   to just something that's controversial, blow up with podcasting. It's not, which means slower
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:07.920]   growth. Yes. But it also means it's much more positive experience. Like I don't get the
[00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:11.520]   negativity. Yeah. But I can also take you out of context. I can take like 10 seconds of this
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:16.400]   podcast and then put it on TikTok and then I can show you like a bad guy. Yeah. Someone will hate
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:23.200]   me if you do that, but I just won't be there to listen. We've talked about authenticity. You've
[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:27.920]   put so much out there. Is there any downside that's come from being so radically transparent?
[00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:34.160]   Zero. And this is, if there's one thing I want the audience to like really, really like understand
[00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:39.520]   is that so far in the last seven years, I've had zero downsides of being public.
[00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:48.160]   Zero. This fear of exposing your privacy is an irrational fear. I've shared how much money I make,
[00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:56.800]   where I live, who I date, how I date, everything about my life and to tens of millions of people.
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:02.880]   And every time I share more, I literally get rewarded more. I will get rewarded more. It's
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:10.080]   crazy. People love you more. People want to help you more. I think we need to get into this culture
[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:15.840]   of like over sharing, sharing what you really are going through because you never know who's
[00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:21.360]   listening on the other side that is dying for somebody else to relate with. And this doesn't
[00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:25.840]   have to mean starting a YouTube channel. It could just be more open with your friends.
[00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:32.000]   Yes. Yes. Yeah. Or even with your LinkedIn feed. Just say, "Hey, I hate my job. Sorry boss,
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.720]   but I don't like my job and I feel like I'm not living the best of my life and this is what I'm
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:46.560]   going to do to change it." The outpouring of support is going to be insane. And so now I'm
[00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:51.520]   living my life. So in my company, there's this culture, it's called always share secrets. It's
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:56.720]   one of the values of the company. Always share secrets. The world is much better when every
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:01.760]   secret is known. Okay. And one of those things has been your relationship. You recently made,
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:06.560]   I think your longest video ever. Yeah. Which is probably shorter than every piece of content I've
[00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:16.160]   ever made about your relationship. And you put how many years into it? Six years. Six years it ended.
[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:22.400]   Yes. And I think you left an interesting message that more people should hear. One, a focus on
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:27.840]   finding something that's the right fit. But also, it sounds like you think that it wasn't a waste
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:33.120]   of time, which I think so many people often think about a failed relationship. Really? Yeah. Yeah,
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:39.920]   you're right actually. They do think about that. I guess maybe I've been lucky in the last six
[00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:46.400]   years because in this relationship, I learned, I felt like I was dating a professor. I was learning
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:53.120]   about things I was never exposed to, like vegetarianism, like animal rights, women's
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:58.000]   rights movements. These are all things I have not been exposed to as a child from a village.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:03.760]   And so in this last six years, and also I've become exposed to how to have sex
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:12.640]   and how to talk. And so I've learned a lot. And I've been exposed to like the Jewish culture,
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:19.360]   right? Because my girlfriend was Jewish as well. It's great. I'm so happy I was exposed to this
[00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:29.040]   stuff. So there's this line that says, no growth of the heart is ever a waste. And I just find that
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:35.920]   line to be so good. No growth of the heart is ever a waste. And so I guess a simple test is,
[00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:39.360]   I look back at my six year relationship and the person listening can do the same.
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:46.080]   Did your heart grow even by 1%? If it did, it's worth it. Because growth of the heart is the
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:49.920]   hardest thing in the world. You can grow your muscles, you can grow your net worth, you can
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:55.440]   grow your company. But growing your heart is mission impossible sometimes. And you need somebody
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:59.360]   to force you to grow it. And my ex-girlfriend did that. And for that, I'm forever thankful.
[00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:05.120]   So traveling exposes you to a lot of things. And I want to go and pretend for a moment,
[00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:07.840]   you have no followers. No one knows who you are.
[00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:08.720]   No one knows I am.
[00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:10.400]   No one. And you're traveling.
[00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:10.640]   Yes.
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:15.600]   And I want to know, one of the things I think you're most well known for is building community
[00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:19.760]   and meeting people and connecting the world. How would you go about doing that from scratch
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:23.200]   if you were in a new place, a new culture, traveling?
[00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:28.960]   I love traveling. And I happen to have been not famous for like 27 years of my life.
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:34.240]   So this is just a recent phenomenon, like five years old, right? So I know how it's like to
[00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:40.960]   travel to like 30, 40 countries without nobody knowing me. But I found out that
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:50.240]   the best way to travel is to go to hostels. And I like strategically now, when I didn't have money
[00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:54.560]   and when I had money, strategically would go to hostels and I would check in a hostel,
[00:27:54.560 --> 00:28:00.080]   ideally at a dorm, not at a private room, because you want to have like these random
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:04.880]   interactions with people that end up leading to friendships. Let's go explore together.
[00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:10.480]   And then I would spend like a crazy amount of time in the lobby of the hostel in the hopes
[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:15.840]   of just like randomly meeting somebody. And then you just need that one person that's also in a
[00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:20.880]   very uncomfortable position, just like you and both of you decide, hey, let's go explore this
[00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:25.280]   country together. And when you have one person, it's easier to find the third. And we have three,
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:32.480]   it's easy to find the fourth, right? So it's all about getting that one partner to want to explore
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:37.600]   the country with you. And so every country I went to, I would literally just go to the hostels to
[00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:40.880]   make the friends, not to stay at the hotel. I don't care about staying in the hostels,
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:43.040]   just to make the friends. - So you'd go to a hostel,
[00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:45.920]   potentially even book a room and not stay in it. - Yes, I did that before.
[00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:52.240]   - Because I imagine sometimes, if you were traveling with your partner, what would you do?
[00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:55.200]   - Oh, so the second tip is to not travel with your partner.
[00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:57.360]   - Okay. - Yeah, so when I started traveling,
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:02.880]   and I've never enjoyed traveling with a partner, if you are trying to make friends. So the minute
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:09.120]   I became self-sufficient in a way, I started traveling with a partner. But I find it actually
[00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:11.200]   really important to travel single. - Okay.
[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:17.120]   - Is that, do you agree or disagree with that? - No, I think it depends. My wife and I love
[00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:21.680]   to explore places together. So I have that kind of player to go on these trips with.
[00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:24.720]   - But you're never gonna get player three. - Yeah, sometimes.
[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:30.640]   - It's gonna be weird as a third wheel. - Well, we went to South Africa, and we
[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:34.640]   wanted to explore by car, and we were cheap. And we were like, "Well, a car holds more than two
[00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:39.760]   people, so what do we do?" And we met these two Swedish guys, and the four of us together bought
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:45.520]   a tent, rented a car, bought four sleeping bags, and we drove around for three weeks through
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:52.080]   Namibia and Botswana and Zambia and South Africa as a team of four. Those two player twos. We didn't
[00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:56.400]   find the three, but we found the three and the four together. But they were both single guys,
[00:29:56.400 --> 00:30:00.000]   they were not in a relationship. So we had a third and fourth wheel.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.360]   - A third and fourth wheel. But that is significantly harder than if you were by
[00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:05.760]   yourself, correct? - Totally. But your strategy
[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:11.440]   seems to be trying to engage with and meet people who are also traveling. How do you try to engage
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:14.320]   and meet people local to the community and learn more about their culture?
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:24.240]   - Yeah, so I found that school networks were also very, very helpful. So I graduated from Harvard,
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:28.800]   and the alumni network is really global. And Harvard people tend to stick together because
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:34.240]   they think they're better than others. So I hope no one's listening to this.
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:43.600]   But so I try to check local Harvard clubs. And if I know a friend that is from that country,
[00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:47.280]   like on Facebook, you know, remember the time with the social graph on Facebook,
[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:52.560]   where you could just search which one of my friends is now in Botswana or lives in Botswana?
[00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:56.560]   And you'd get a couple of people in every one of these countries. And that's really all you need.
[00:30:56.560 --> 00:31:01.360]   It's all about getting the hook, the one person that will open the doors to you for to meet the
[00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:06.160]   next 10 people. It's that's how I think about it. So I just find the hook in the first two days.
[00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:08.720]   And then the hook takes care of everything else. They find me the next 10 people.
[00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:11.440]   - Do you ever find the hook just like at a bar, at a restaurant?
[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:15.440]   Because I think that's what people assume. They assume I'm going to go to a bar,
[00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:18.480]   and I'm going to randomly talk to a stranger. And now I'm going to go on a...
[00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:22.320]   - That's how you find the hook up. Not the hook.
[00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:24.800]   - Okay. - So I found it very difficult to meet
[00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:28.640]   people at a restaurant because you're sitting down the whole time. How do you meet people at
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:32.080]   a restaurant? - Or a bar or an event like that.
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:35.840]   Maybe not a restaurant. - Yeah. No, I had no success in this.
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:39.920]   - Okay. Is there something every time you go to a new country that you try to make sure you do?
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:46.160]   - It was by nature of my job, but I try to make videos as much as possible of every person I go
[00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:50.560]   to. Because I found that when you travel, you're making so many memories, but you'll forget these
[00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:57.840]   memories if you don't take videos of them. For me, travel is a form of archiving. Literally,
[00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:02.960]   I feel like I have my camera with me at all time. Memorize, memorize, memorize, memorize. Because
[00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:08.320]   you want to not forget this experience. So that's how I became a video maker and traveling video
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:10.640]   maker. - How do you make sure you're not just
[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:14.320]   living behind the camera when you're traveling? - I am living behind the camera when I'm traveling.
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:15.760]   Who said I'm not? - Okay.
[00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:19.360]   - Do you make content when you travel? - Almost never.
[00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:22.720]   - Almost never? - I make content about the travels.
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:25.680]   So I'll go to a country, come back and talk about the experience.
[00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:28.480]   - You're kidding. - But I'm not making them... I mean,
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:35.120]   I made a video once in a country talking about how I got there, but I don't know. I want to be there
[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:40.880]   and I don't want to be distracted from wandering around and seeing things, thinking about, "Oh,
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:43.760]   what? I got to go record this thing." For me, that seems like it'd be overwhelming.
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:47.040]   - Wow. That's interesting. Well, I guess you and I travel differently. We should
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:49.440]   try to travel together one day. - I would like to see what that goes.
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:55.040]   Yeah. So I don't know how many countries you've been to, but it's a lot. You've hit off countries
[00:32:55.040 --> 00:33:00.160]   that many people have never been to. What are some places that you think people are just sleeping on
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:04.560]   that are really underrated? - So five days ago, I was in Greenland,
[00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:10.720]   and I think it's a really place that a lot of people are sleeping on. Nobody lives in Greenland,
[00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:14.880]   only 57,000 people live in Greenland, and very, very few people visit it. And the people that
[00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:22.080]   visit it are usually the older population. But I'd say Greenland is hard to get to, and that's why
[00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:30.720]   a lot of people are sleeping on it. But generally, I found that Asia is full of surprises,
[00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:37.840]   probably more than Europe and Africa and Latin America. I found Asia to be much more full of
[00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:43.040]   energy, and it has 60% of the world's humans, right? So it is the majority of the world.
[00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:48.480]   So I become a big fan of Asia after traveling there. I'd say Maldives, not a whole lot of
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:53.440]   Americans went to the Maldives. It's the only country I went to five times that go back to,
[00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:58.400]   five times, most countries I try not to go back to. But the Maldives just has a special aura
[00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:04.560]   that I just feel like it's missing in the American zeitgeist. It's not there. Why?
[00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:08.000]   - So the feedback I've heard from everyone that's been to Maldives, I'm wondering if you did it
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.640]   differently, was like, you basically land at a resort, and you stay at the resort the whole
[00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:14.960]   time, and then you leave. - And what's better than that?
[00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:22.880]   - But is that the experience? You described, I think you love connecting with locals and having
[00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:26.800]   these amazing experiences. I look at all your videos, and the Maldives, I think it's like,
[00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:30.640]   you just stayed at an expensive hotel. That's it. It seems antithetical to the thing you would
[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:33.840]   normally love doing. - That's why when I go to
[00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:38.000]   countries with big populations, it's work. When you're making videos, it's work. But when I go
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.080]   to the Maldives, it's actual travel for me, because there's no people to make videos about,
[00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:46.160]   there's no videos to make, you're just actually relaxing. So maybe that's why I like, actually,
[00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:49.440]   I never thought about that. That's why I like the Maldives. It is where I relax.
[00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:53.600]   - Yeah, so that's how I travel. I'm not making the videos. You just need to go somewhere and
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:56.560]   not make a video. - So you travel, and then
[00:34:56.560 --> 00:35:03.280]   what's your goal when you travel? - I like just learning new things.
[00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:05.600]   I think it would be the broader thing. Learning and eating new things.
[00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:08.480]   - Learning and eating new things. - So like meeting interesting people,
[00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:12.160]   hearing different perspectives, seeing different things, thinking about how those
[00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:14.800]   things came to be, why things happened in a certain way.
[00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:16.960]   - Have you been to Easter Island? - No.
[00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:19.200]   - Okay, you should check it out. It's close. - Okay.
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:23.280]   - Easter Island is like, you can learn things, there's people there, and it's like really remote,
[00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:25.440]   like the Maldives. - Okay, yeah. I mean,
[00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:29.120]   don't get me wrong. Our version of the Maldives, because I think you live in Dubai, and I live in
[00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:34.960]   the Bay Area, is Bora Bora. It's like eight-hour flight, super easy, compared to the Maldives,
[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:37.040]   which is like literally maybe halfway around the world.
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:42.160]   - And how often do you go to Bora Bora? - We went twice, and it was super relaxing,
[00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:48.080]   but it didn't really feel like travel in that. There was no... We weren't eating...
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:54.640]   There's some local things that the hotel makes, but when we go to Thailand, it's like,
[00:35:54.640 --> 00:36:01.120]   let's go to some back alley night market, let's sit down on a stool and eat something delicious,
[00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:06.240]   and meet random people, and talk about what they're doing, and then find out where that
[00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:11.600]   leads us, and wander and explore. That doesn't happen. Those are the most memorable experiences
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:18.400]   for me, and I don't get those. I love relaxing on a beach also, but to me, they're two totally
[00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:20.480]   different things. - I guess it depends on how much
[00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:23.920]   you travel per year, because if you travel for three, four, five months a year, which is how
[00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:30.400]   much I travel, for work and for fun, sometimes I want to relax by doing that, the two-weeks thing,
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:34.720]   but most people have two weeks to travel, so you want to do as much crazy things as possible,
[00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:40.640]   drink at a bar in Thailand, and go hopping in Taiwan or Japan, so I understand why that is
[00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:44.240]   appealing as well. - Okay, let's rewind.
[00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:46.560]   - Yes. - I think one of the
[00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:50.640]   interesting things for people who don't know your story, there's a million podcasts they can go
[00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:55.680]   listen to to hear your story, but the one aspect of it I want to focus on that I think is relevant
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:59.200]   to a lot of people is taking a big bet on yourself. - Yes.
[00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:05.120]   - And so many people, you quit a job that was, for many people, a dream job,
[00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:08.400]   and you bet on yourself, and a lot of people do that by saying, "I'm going to start a little
[00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:12.800]   side hustle." I sometimes think in order to make something work, you kind of have to go all in on
[00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:18.880]   it and commit. Can you talk a little bit about how you built it? You could tell about the experience,
[00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:24.080]   but how did you build up that conviction, and how did you find a way to make it even more
[00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:28.000]   affordable than, you know, you stretched your dollars way more than most people do when they
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.280]   quit? - Yeah, and that's what people don't
[00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:35.200]   realize is that living in New York or SF is actually really dangerous because now you are
[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:40.960]   really enslaved to the daily life costs of living here. And, you know, you're just talking about
[00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:45.440]   this like you need a lot of money every month just to survive. - It's funny because my wife and I had
[00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:51.200]   this conversation because now I'm a creator, and the income of a creator is more variable, right?
[00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:56.240]   It could be very high, but also if the economy collapses and brands stop wanting to advertise,
[00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:57.280]   it could go to zero. - Yes.
[00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:02.000]   - There's an amount of money in my mind that's like we could live on somewhere,
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.240]   and then there's an amount of money that it's like we could keep living our current lifestyle,
[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:10.320]   and I think that number is like almost maybe 2x. - Wow.
[00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:15.120]   - I think that if you didn't need to live in the Bay Area, first off-
[00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:16.960]   - But it's in the tens of thousands. - Yeah.
[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:18.640]   - It's not like $3,000. - No.
[00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:22.320]   - Which is crazy talk if you think about this, like if anybody listening to this,
[00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:28.720]   you need tens of thousands of dollars to maintain a lifestyle here in San Francisco, right? Which
[00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:31.600]   means you will always need- - I wouldn't say that, I'd say it's
[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:35.600]   maybe me, but I would say when we were living in San Francisco before we had children,
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:40.960]   I think our annual burn was under 10,000 a month for sure.
[00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:43.360]   - Got it, got it. - So I would say-
[00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:46.000]   - But that's still high too for two people. - For two people.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.640]   - Without kids. - Without kids, definitely under 10.
[00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:51.840]   - So my burn in New York, and this is why I decided to take a bet on myself,
[00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:59.040]   my burn in New York was roughly $3,500 per month. And my salary was roughly seven,
[00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:03.200]   but that still was a little bit too high for my own comfort. And I realized that if I just leave
[00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:11.120]   my job and use my savings and burn $1,000 in India or Ethiopia and learn and work on self-improving
[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:15.840]   myself, I could extend my runway by two years, three years, four years. And so that's what I did.
[00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:20.800]   I just left my life in New York and I just went to Kenya, Nairobi, Kenya, and I started
[00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:25.120]   learning how to make videos and traveling by making videos and connecting with locals.
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:29.760]   And the first two years, of course, it was self-sustained. I was losing money using my
[00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:36.880]   own savings, but I was still saving money from, if I stayed living in New York, I would have spent
[00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:43.680]   more money. So it made sense to travel. Traveling for me was a way to save money. And that's what
[00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:50.000]   people don't realize is that traveling should be expensive. Actually, no, if you leave America,
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:55.200]   the world is shockingly cheap. Yeah. If you leave your life for two weeks,
[00:39:55.200 --> 00:40:00.560]   you don't save any money, but if you leave your life for six months, 12 months, you can save money.
[00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:06.640]   In fact, when we left our life for eight months, we traveled around the world and we subletted our
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:10.080]   apartment, right? Because we couldn't get out of our lease, but we had all this furniture and we
[00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:13.200]   thought, "Oh, well, we could probably rent it for more than we're paying because it has furniture."
[00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:19.760]   And we almost broke even on the cost to travel. So it was just traveling for free because we
[00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:23.520]   actually made that kind of major change. And you had all these point hacks and whatnot.
[00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:29.120]   Yeah. Back then I didn't have as many, but the number one way to burn money traveling
[00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:37.840]   is to fly on an airplane. The marginal cost to add an extra week to a trip to Thailand
[00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:42.320]   is very low relative to the marginal cost to come back for another week later.
[00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:45.680]   Yeah. So the cost of a one-week trip versus a five-week trip is very...
[00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:49.440]   I would say that... I don't know. I wish I had a rule of thumb, but I would say a five-week trip
[00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:55.920]   is probably cheaper than two one-week trips, is my guess. Just because, at least for us,
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:59.440]   the international flight, it's hard to find international flight for less than $1,000.
[00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:04.400]   The way we were traveling at the time, it's very easy to find a place to stay for $10 a night.
[00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:06.960]   Right. Our budget was under $30 a day.
[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:09.760]   Yeah. But there's just no way... Yes,
[00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:13.920]   points and miles make the flights cheaper, but there's no way if you don't have points to make
[00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:18.640]   the flight less than maybe $800. This is also an American problem because
[00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:23.360]   you're really surrounded by nothing. San Francisco, if you want to get to the next country,
[00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:28.080]   if it's not Mexico or Canada, you're looking at seven hours.
[00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:30.320]   Yeah. That's very far.
[00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:36.960]   And if you live in, let's say, Dubai, you can reach, I think, 60% of the world within seven
[00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:44.000]   hours. Did you know that? So a flight from Dubai to Pakistan is cheap. Pakistan to Thailand, cheap.
[00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:50.560]   Thailand to Laos, cheap. All these flights are so interconnected. The world is much more closer
[00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:55.280]   to each other outside of the American continent. It's just the North American and South American
[00:41:55.280 --> 00:42:00.160]   continents are just way too stretched vertically that it becomes really difficult to travel.
[00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:06.560]   And that's why I find it hard to live here because you cannot travel in an efficient
[00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:11.440]   manner financially and time-wise. Well, I think you could play the points game
[00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:14.640]   and make that work. Yes, that I don't know how to do.
[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:18.400]   But yeah, we got to work on that. Where are you putting all these expenses for your businesses?
[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:23.200]   I don't collect points, by the way. I've traveled for three years. I don't collect points.
[00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:25.840]   And I just don't know how to do it. And I think it's the world's biggest fraud.
[00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:32.160]   And I think points is just like a meme coin. It's like a crypto coin. And it's just like,
[00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:37.360]   oh, yeah, I have 100,000 delta miles. And what the fuck is the value of every mile? Do you know?
[00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:41.840]   Like some random executive can like inflate or deflate the whole value of your miles
[00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:47.360]   overnight and you have no control over it. But if you're flying on a Delta flight internationally,
[00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:50.560]   you're not going to put some frequent flyer program number in there?
[00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:53.440]   No, I don't do that. I've never done that. Why?
[00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:59.520]   I just think it's a game everybody plays and I don't see the benefit of it.
[00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:03.920]   Well, there's not a risk though, right? Like you buy a flight from here to Dubai.
[00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:07.280]   What is the risk of putting a frequent flyer number?
[00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:13.680]   So I don't know what the number is. So I mean, just for context, I'm the kind of guy who
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:17.760]   has 20 T-shirts that look identical to each other in his entire wardrobe.
[00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:22.560]   So I'm also like scared of like buying a different T-shirt because I don't want to
[00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:30.400]   make the decision of which T-shirt to wear today, you know? So I'm on a mission to streamline my
[00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:35.440]   life in a way that allows me to not think. Let's talk about that.
[00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:36.800]   Yes. What are other ways you do that?
[00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:44.800]   So it's same shoes, two pants, all the same color, 20 T-shirts, all the same design,
[00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:54.640]   same everything, identical. I have no material object that I have any emotional attachment to
[00:43:54.640 --> 00:44:00.400]   in my life other than my laptop. And my laptop is replaceable because it's locked and it's
[00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:05.440]   all in the cloud. So even if I lose my laptop, it's fine. So if anybody gets into my house,
[00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:09.120]   they can steal anything they want, and I don't care. I've never locked my house in three years.
[00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:13.680]   My phone, I guess I have an emotional attachment to my phone. So I'm only emotionally attached
[00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:17.760]   to my phone and my laptop, and that's it. And some servers in the cloud that are
[00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:22.080]   holding all of your important information. Yeah. But nothing else in my life is important.
[00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:25.120]   Okay. What about decisions around what to eat?
[00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:31.200]   Oh, that I also streamlined. So I'm vegetarian, which basically means 90% of food menus are not
[00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:36.560]   relevant to me because they're full of dead animals. And I also try to eat the same thing.
[00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:41.440]   So I try to eat the same thing for breakfast, the same thing for dinner, same thing for lunch.
[00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:48.000]   So eggs, it has a lot of proteins and a salad, egg salad, egg salad, egg salad every single day.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.880]   So now I don't have to think about food. What else?
[00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:56.240]   Health, like exercise. Oh, health. Yeah. One hour per day,
[00:44:56.240 --> 00:45:00.080]   that's it. Same exercise. What kind of exercise?
[00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:03.200]   Oh, and also don't have to think about what I exercise because I have a personal trainer.
[00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:04.720]   Okay. So he comes and tells me,
[00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:09.200]   move your hand left, move your hand right. And I said, okay. And so now I've been able
[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:14.640]   to save my brain capacity to focus on what really matters, right? Building a company,
[00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:20.720]   making videos, furthering my career. And I just, and I don't do laundry. I'm very lucky to,
[00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:24.800]   very, very lucky to not have to do laundry. I never clean after myself. I never cook,
[00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:31.920]   never cook. I just don't want to do things that are like maintenance jobs.
[00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:35.760]   So maintenance jobs, eating is a maintenance job, but cooking is a maintenance job. You
[00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:39.280]   eat today, you poop it in the next five hours, right? And then you have to do it again next
[00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:44.240]   five hours and again and again and again for the rest of your life. So unless you derive joy from
[00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:49.680]   cooking, which I don't, there's no point to cook. And there's no point to clean because it's going
[00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:54.400]   to get dirty the next day. So you need to find, you need to be able to like find somebody to help
[00:45:54.400 --> 00:46:01.840]   you clean. And this way I just don't do any maintenance work and also focus on just building,
[00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:07.280]   like growing on top of what I built yesterday. Okay. Does that make sense? Yeah. Yeah. I mean,
[00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:11.280]   does it sound conceited or rich people's stuff? I mean, I happen to know that you live in a
[00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:18.160]   country where having someone help you do laundry and cook or clean is significantly less expensive
[00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:24.400]   than it is safe. Yeah. I still pay quite a lot because I'm paying double the market rate. So I
[00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:29.600]   do believe in like fair wage. That's important. But even here, you can get a helper in America
[00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:33.040]   for like two hours. You can get food delivery. Everybody gets food delivery. I get food delivery.
[00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:38.000]   I don't need somebody to cook for me. So it's something I did before I got rich as well.
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:42.800]   And I never cleaned my room when I was poor. When I was two, I never did it. Are you kidding?
[00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:49.600]   Why would I? So yeah. Are there maintenance jobs that do bring you joy that you'd like to do?
[00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:57.360]   No. Or how do you like to spend your time for fun? What is fun? I'm joking. I mean,
[00:46:57.360 --> 00:47:00.000]   do you do maintenance? I'm actually more interested in you. Do you do maintenance stuff?
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:08.160]   Some things I like for weird reasons enjoy. Like what? We have a hot tub. You got to balance the
[00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:12.480]   chemicals on the hot tub. And like, it's kind of fun. I take my two and a half year old daughter,
[00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:15.520]   we go scoop up a little water, we put it in this thing, and we see the chemicals,
[00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:17.200]   and we measure it out. But it's a five minute job.
[00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:21.680]   Yeah, it's not that long. But it's something that, "Oh, we got to do that this week." So
[00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:28.240]   we could hire someone to come to the house and do it. I really struggle, and it sounds like you
[00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:35.840]   don't, with things where the mental burden or the overhead of thinking about it doesn't quite
[00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:40.880]   equate to the cost. And so you don't factor it in as well. So for someone to come to the house and
[00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:46.000]   put some chemicals in the hot tub, it takes five minutes. I'm sure the cost for that is going to
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:53.440]   be more than an average hourly wage times five over 60. It's just going to be much more expensive
[00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:57.200]   than that, I assume. I've looked a little bit. And so it's just hard for me to be like, "I'm
[00:47:57.200 --> 00:48:00.640]   going to pay someone $200 a month to come to my house for five minutes three times."
[00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:06.400]   But you're not factoring your brain cost? No, no. I think it's very hard for many people,
[00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:11.280]   myself included, to factor in that cost of doing all of these other things in life.
[00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:18.800]   Yeah, exactly. So if we add that hidden cost to what we do, I think many people will not do what
[00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:25.200]   they do today. Many people will stop cooking if they factor in the value of one hour of freedom
[00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:30.640]   outside of work in your 20s when you could be building a startup or building a career or
[00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:35.680]   building a whatever or building a family. Now, again, big disclaimers, if you enjoy cooking,
[00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:38.960]   it's amazing. And if you don't enjoy cooking, then that's where the problem is.
[00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:44.720]   And what do you encourage someone to do with that extra time? Not everyone knows,
[00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:48.880]   "I want to start a company." Are there things you think people should be spending more of
[00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:53.200]   their time on if it's not maintenance work? Yeah. So what's not maintenance work? I think
[00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:57.200]   that's a really important question. What is not maintenance? So in life, maintenance is
[00:48:57.200 --> 00:49:02.400]   cleaning your car is maintenance. Doing your bed is maintenance. Cooking food is maintenance,
[00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:08.640]   right? To maintain your thing. What I think is not maintenance is building relationships,
[00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:14.160]   building family. Because if I invest today in my wife or my husband or whatever, in the future,
[00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:18.480]   it results in a nice family. So I don't view that as maintenance. I view that as building
[00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:24.400]   for the future, building a company, building a career, and building your body, focusing on your
[00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:29.280]   fitness and physique. I think those are the four things I've identified as non-maintenance things,
[00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:34.400]   and I'm happy to invest in them. I invest a lot. So because I'm single now, unfortunately,
[00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:39.760]   I invest a lot of my time into fitness and building my business. I have two companies,
[00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:44.000]   so I'm building those. So that's the only thing I view as non-maintenance work.
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:48.160]   Everything else is maintenance. So there is one thing about travel that I noticed that's
[00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:52.160]   interesting about you. I have seen you travel to places like the Maldives. You post all your
[00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:56.560]   travels online. Anyone listening can see them. And you would think someone successful like you,
[00:49:56.560 --> 00:50:02.320]   someone with money like you, would travel in a certain way. And even when you're traveling for
[00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:08.960]   work, you're still not staying at the Four Seasons. And I'm curious, what is it about your
[00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:15.120]   style of travel, your belief about money? It seems like you don't think you have enough money,
[00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:20.800]   and you're still in this scarcity mindset. Yeah, man. Just listening to this, I get a
[00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:28.720]   little bit sad. Because I'm mentally poor. There is a thing called mental poverty. And I feel
[00:50:28.720 --> 00:50:33.680]   mentally poor, even though my bank account has millions of dollars. But mentally, I feel poor,
[00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:41.680]   and I don't know why. Maybe because my formative childhood years, I spent obsessing over $2 here,
[00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:49.600]   $3 there, saving $2 there, that I just don't see why I would want to spend $200 extra for the same
[00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:54.160]   bed and the same roof, just because it's the Four Seasons. So now I'm staying at a place called
[00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:58.240]   Axiom, which is like, you know, 100 meters away from the Four Seasons. But it's like, you know,
[00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:05.840]   $250 in San Francisco, not bad, as opposed to $500. So I'm saving a lot of money. But I don't
[00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:11.680]   know why. What do you do? Because we have similar net worth. People don't know this, Chris. But you
[00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:15.680]   and I have the same amount of money, which is crazy, because I have 60 million more followers
[00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:22.800]   than you. And I don't know why I couldn't monetize. But how do you spend money at the Four Seasons?
[00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:31.680]   So this is why I like points, by the way, because I'm just saying, I enjoy nice hotels. But it's so
[00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:35.760]   funny. I talk to people all the time to tell me how much they spend on vacation. And I'm like,
[00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:40.240]   wow, I could never spend that much money. Like it's so, you're gonna spend $1,000 a night on a
[00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:46.160]   hotel. That seems wild. Like, why would you do that? I don't get a ton of value out of some
[00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:52.000]   aspects of travel, and I do on others. So if I was going to try to have some experience, I'd rather
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:56.240]   hire the right, you know, the right person to take me through the market to show me all the
[00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:59.200]   interesting things, who's a local who's been there and support that community,
[00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:03.280]   than to pay for, you know, a hotel that has nicer furnishing.
[00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:06.080]   Yes, because you like experiences.
[00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:06.800]   Yeah.
[00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:08.560]   But staying at a hotel can be an experience.
[00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:15.120]   Yeah, I think the experience I want in a hotel might be, you know, I could imagine spending more
[00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:18.960]   money for a hotel that's like, gives you the experience that you describe in, you know,
[00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:22.320]   the Maldives where you're over the water, and you have a bunch of extra things. But if I'm in San
[00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:25.680]   Francisco, like, I don't even know if I'd want to spend... I was in New York. And I was like,
[00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:32.480]   what is the absolute cheapest hotel I can stay at that, you know, isn't like two stars, like just
[00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:37.920]   like horrible reviews. Yeah, I say to the hotel, I don't recommend it. Like, I wouldn't ever tell
[00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:42.560]   anyone you should stay there. It was an amazing experience. I don't, I got checked in at 11pm.
[00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:46.240]   And they're like, your room's not ready. And I was like, how is it not ready to 11pm? Like,
[00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:49.920]   this doesn't even make sense. And I go, it might be a clerical error. And then 20 minutes later,
[00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:55.600]   it was magically ready. And it looked like no one had, like, it looked like a room that they designed
[00:52:55.600 --> 00:53:00.800]   10 years ago, and then have not repainted any of the things that have chipped off and fallen apart.
[00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:04.080]   And it was also $250, which is crazy expensive.
[00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:11.600]   I've talked to a lot of people on this topic of mental poverty. And the idea that, you know,
[00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:16.000]   you ask anyone how much money they want to get to, and once they get there, they're never done.
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:19.520]   They're always want more, they always want more, they always want more. And then I've
[00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:22.960]   talked to a few people that have just completely disconnected from the concept. And they're like,
[00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:29.840]   I just don't care. And I think in the last couple of years, I've kind of stopped caring about growing
[00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:34.160]   network. Doesn't matter. Really? Yeah. And I had this conversation with my wife, where we were
[00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:38.240]   talking about what our goals were. And she was like, I want to get to this net worth target.
[00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:41.600]   And I was like, I don't. She's like, really? You don't want to get there? I was like,
[00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:46.320]   what do we like? Why do we want to have more money saved? Now when we if we have more money,
[00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:49.680]   would we rather spend it? Would you rather give it away? Like what things would we want to do
[00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:57.200]   with our money than just build up this like, you know, Scrooge McDuck pile of money. And I don't
[00:53:57.200 --> 00:54:01.680]   feel like I care about flying in a private jet. Like, like, as far as if you think of like,
[00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:05.440]   if you could have unlimited money, what would you do? There's not that many different things.
[00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:09.280]   I realized I speak from a place of privilege right now. But there's not that many more
[00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:14.160]   things that I think my money is worth doing anything that I don't enjoy doing to get.
[00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:18.720]   And so should I if I didn't like doing this job? Should I keep doing it? No,
[00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:21.680]   it's not doing it. Should my wife do her job if she doesn't like it? No, she's like,
[00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:27.760]   we should stop doing the things because we're in a place that we can. Yeah. And I think I've
[00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:34.560]   been able to not care as much about money as as I did. But that doesn't help. But that actually
[00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:42.160]   means you're mentally rich. Yeah, that's what I'm hearing. Yeah, I feel like I'm not I used to feel
[00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:47.440]   mentally poor and I don't feel that way anymore. So the congratulations you have become you have
[00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:51.920]   you have you have you have defeated the poverty in your brain. Because the minute you stop caring
[00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:57.600]   about money or fearing about money, then you are mentally rich and you're living life the way you
[00:54:57.600 --> 00:55:02.160]   life is supposed to be lived without worrying or thinking about money. I'm still in the mental
[00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:08.480]   poverty side because I have a fear of losing it. I have a fear that the next month it's going to
[00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:13.360]   dry up. I have a fear that I don't have enough. And I have a fear that I'm still enslaved to it.
[00:55:13.360 --> 00:55:20.880]   And even though that you could you've you more than me and more than almost anyone listening
[00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:24.960]   knows how inexpensively you could live somewhere. Yes. And you probably have enough that you could
[00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:29.120]   live in a place for the rest of your life and never think about. So it depends what you want
[00:55:29.120 --> 00:55:33.760]   to do with life. Right. So one of my dreams is to start an airline. I'd like to start a
[00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:40.720]   fucking airline. Why not? You know, and and I want to be able to come up with ideas and see
[00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:45.520]   them happen in real life. For me, that's the ultimate freedom. It's not to stay at the Four
[00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:50.480]   Seasons and it's not to like buy a Gucci bag and it's not to like fly in a private jet is come up
[00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:56.880]   with ideas for projects and have enough money to see them happen. So I'd like to put ten million
[00:55:56.880 --> 00:56:02.640]   dollars into funding a startup that does fake meat, you know, like cell based meat. I would
[00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:07.600]   like to try to buy one plane and see if we can come up with a different airline that's more fun
[00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:12.640]   and more human and more social, compete with Virgin Atlantic or whatever. These are ideas.
[00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:17.680]   I kind of don't want to die without trying them. I want to try a hotel. I want to build a hotel.
[00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:23.040]   Can I build a better hotel than the Four Seasons? That's like really cool. So I think it's the
[00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:29.520]   reason I like money is it enables you to think crazy and do crazy and be crazy. And I just love
[00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:35.120]   crazy. So, yes, I could live in a house for the rest of my life and not worry about money and
[00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:39.360]   just like, you know, live on top of a mountain. But but but then I have so many ideas that I
[00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:48.720]   cannot execute on. And that for me is sadness. That is sadness. So I still can't execute many
[00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:53.040]   of the ideas that I'd like to do because they're simply too expensive. So your relationship is out
[00:56:53.040 --> 00:56:57.680]   there. Your life's out there. What's what's the end goal for you? Is it is it fame? Is it money?
[00:56:57.680 --> 00:57:03.920]   You know, is it building something? Yeah. So fame and money is is is is not an end goal
[00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:08.000]   because people that look like me do not become famous. So it's not something I think about.
[00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:15.120]   But the end goal is to build something out of nothing. I think that is probably the sexiest
[00:57:15.120 --> 00:57:21.680]   thing in the world. Create something of value out of nothing, out of thin air. The United States
[00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:27.040]   government creates money out of thin air. Amazing. Right. But what can you create out of thin air?
[00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:32.960]   Right. You created kids. That's amazing. That's so magical. You've created a company, a podcast.
[00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:40.960]   I just feel like the act of going from zero to one is just better than sex. And I wish everybody
[00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:47.040]   can experience that at some point in their life. The act of creation, of creating either a human
[00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:52.560]   or a project or a startup or a company or a piece of content. And if somebody is not creating enough,
[00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:58.240]   maybe I maybe I'll end with that message is like, try to do something from zero to one.
[00:57:58.240 --> 00:58:02.480]   It'll probably be the most satisfying thing you do in your life. Do you have any advice for someone
[00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:07.360]   who's like, I want to be creative, but I don't know? I don't know. How do they find the thing
[00:58:07.360 --> 00:58:12.240]   that they could go try to create? Yeah. And creative doesn't mean make videos and be artistic
[00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:17.840]   and make a song, right? Creative can be build an amazing family. Creative can be build a company,
[00:58:17.840 --> 00:58:25.680]   build a house, have a sign hobby, whatever. So build an ebook, whatever. So I think the word
[00:58:25.680 --> 00:58:31.360]   creator should not be just limited to you and me. A creator is also a father and a mother.
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:37.120]   And so it doesn't have to be public, does it? Like, no, write a book, keep it for yourself.
[00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:42.080]   It doesn't have to be something you publish. Yeah. Seen something go from nothing to something. Yes,
[00:58:42.080 --> 00:58:46.560]   from nothing to something. And this thing exists purely because of you and your efforts and your
[00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:53.280]   sheer determination and will and will. And I just I find that to be so sexy. I don't know if other
[00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:59.360]   people relate to this message. If they do, please message me. Let me know at Yasin@NAS.io. Y-A-S-S-I-N
[00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:09.040]   @NAS.io. N-A-S.io. But yeah, that's just a feeling that I've of the last 30, 31 years. It's the only
[00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:12.960]   feeling that's worth pursuing every single day for the rest of my life. I love it. Well, we're
[00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:17.760]   here creating. Hopefully people enjoy it. I want to hear stories. If people are finding new things
[00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:22.960]   to create, send them in. Yes. And also I did ask people to send you hate messages, right? Yes. Yeah,
[00:59:22.960 --> 00:59:29.040]   yeah. So we got hate mail coming in and whatever they're creating. Yes. Perfect. Awesome. Let me
[00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:29.880]   - Let me know how it goes.
[00:59:29.880 --> 00:59:30.920]   - Nasir, thanks for coming by.
