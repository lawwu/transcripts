[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480]   The coronavirus pandemic is a global crisis,
[00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.440]   but I think it's also a moment that unites us,
[00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.200]   that gives us an opportunity
[00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.080]   to show the strength of our community,
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.900]   to be compassionate to our fellow human beings,
[00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.080]   and to work hard to fight this thing.
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.320]   And I think we will, and I think we'll beat it.
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.720]   So I wanted to make a video about, in my view,
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.480]   seven different levels at which the coronavirus
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.920]   is attacking the fundamental nature of our society,
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.720]   and how we can fight back,
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.080]   and how we can emerge stronger together.
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.840]   The seven levels of attack are biological, medical,
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.200]   level number one, that attacks the individual human life
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.640]   and death, and the biology, the wellbeing,
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.180]   the health of an individual human being.
[00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.520]   Psychological, which is attacking the emotional stability,
[00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.760]   the fear, and the ability to love and be compassionate
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.160]   towards our fellow human beings
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.280]   in the individual psychology of a person.
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.960]   Level number three is social,
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.320]   which is attacking the collective cognition,
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.540]   the collective intelligence of our species,
[00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.240]   instilling panic, the spread of misinformation,
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:06.960]   the spread of conspiracies.
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.800]   Level number four is economic,
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.480]   attacking the financial stability of our global markets,
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.480]   the employment of individuals, productivity,
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.480]   and generally the financial burden,
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.280]   especially the imbalance of the financial burden
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.920]   carried by individuals.
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.680]   Level number five is political,
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.960]   exacerbating the partisanship,
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.840]   and the ability to make effective policy
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.960]   and respond to the virus at the federal,
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.440]   at the global scale.
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.440]   Level number six is existential,
[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.360]   which is taking perhaps a step back
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.080]   from the concerns of the current natural pandemic,
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.400]   and looking at civilization level extinction,
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.840]   looking at existential threats that may be among us today,
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.160]   and may be posed to us in this coming century,
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.360]   from artificial intelligence, to nanotechnology,
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.820]   to engineered pandemics and other concerns.
[00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.440]   And level seven is really taking a step back
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.380]   and looking at the philosophical.
[00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.400]   The test the virus presents to us,
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.040]   to consider the fundamental fabric of the human condition
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.900]   at the individual level and the societal level.
[00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.280]   What are we supposed to be together?
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.600]   How are we supposed to live?
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.820]   What is the meaning of it all?
[00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.240]   And what is the best path forward for us as a society
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.800]   in the coming decades, in the coming centuries?
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.580]   The meaning of life, as silly perhaps,
[00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.680]   and unanswerable the question is,
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.080]   is also perhaps the most important question of all.
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.600]   And if there's ever a time to consider, to ponder,
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.140]   to try to answer that question, it is now.
[00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.000]   It's an opportunity that the virus presents.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.380]   So if you allow me, I'd like to talk
[00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.820]   to the seven different levels of attack from coronavirus
[00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.500]   in a video that's a little bit different,
[00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.300]   perhaps than some of the videos out there,
[00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.740]   and certainly from the videos that I'm used to making.
[00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.640]   I've been doing a lot of data aggregation and analysis,
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.220]   a lot of simulation for forecasting purposes,
[00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.080]   even simulation for revealing the mathematical patterns
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.000]   in the spread of a pandemic.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.720]   There's a lot of interesting ideas there
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.760]   that I hope to explore either privately
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.640]   or publicly through the video format,
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.480]   or blogs, or even papers.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.280]   But this video is higher level.
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.820]   It's thinking of the big picture of this virus.
[00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.040]   So if you allow me, I'd like to talk about three things
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.480]   for each of the levels.
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.780]   One is the pain we're likely to feel.
[00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.500]   Two is the challenge for us to overcome.
[00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.500]   And three is the hope, the silver lining,
[00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.340]   the light at the end of the tunnel.
[00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.800]   It's really important to mention that if there's any errors
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.460]   or expansions possible on something I say in this video,
[00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:36.540]   please let me know.
[00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.760]   I will add corrections and expansions into the description.
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.720]   So please also read the description to this video.
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.940]   The burden I carry with making a video like this
[00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.500]   and future videos on the coronavirus
[00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.820]   is mistakes here could cost lives.
[00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.700]   So I'm very cognizant of that.
[00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:53.540]   I'm very careful.
[00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:54.900]   Please read the description
[00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.820]   and please let me know if there's any errors in the data
[00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.980]   or just even the wording of the things I say.
[00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.580]   So looking at level one first,
[00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.060]   at the biological and the medical,
[00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.500]   the direct attack of the virus on the human body.
[00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.420]   It's very difficult to make projections
[00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.300]   about the number of cases that we're likely to observe,
[00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.740]   at least in the first wave,
[00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.700]   and the number of deaths that we're likely to observe.
[00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:19.980]   Many people, including myself,
[00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.300]   are carefully looking at the data,
[00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.460]   aggregating it, analyzing it,
[00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.540]   but it's still not a good time to make a good projection.
[00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.220]   It is perhaps a good hopeful message
[00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.320]   to consider the best case scenario.
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.700]   If the government's response swiftly,
[00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.260]   if we all do our part,
[00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.180]   if the hospital resources don't become overwhelmed,
[00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.860]   it's possible that the level of deaths that we observe
[00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.060]   is at or below the levels of annual influenza deaths,
[00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.580]   which is still a tragic, a tragic number.
[00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.400]   Now, if the response is not swift from governments
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.180]   and individuals doing our part,
[00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.740]   then the worst case number of deaths
[00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.680]   could count in the millions.
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.340]   Still too difficult to tell,
[00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.500]   but this virus from everything we see
[00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.100]   on the biological side is much more dangerous
[00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.640]   than the influenza virus, than the flu.
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.680]   So this level is one that there's already been
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.180]   a lot of great information on,
[00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.560]   blogs, papers, videos, the CDC.
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.100]   You should make sure you're paying attention,
[00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.000]   but the message is clear.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.800]   For individuals, you should stay home,
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.300]   social isolation, social distancing,
[00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.620]   wash hands, don't get infected, and don't infect others.
[00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.240]   For the medical infrastructure,
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.060]   the people really fighting,
[00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.460]   really heroes fighting on the front lines
[00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.320]   are the healthcare workers and the service workers,
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.960]   making sure our society still runs,
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.320]   making sure people who are sick are getting help.
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.980]   The thing that I've seen is I understand
[00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:45.420]   that works really well is the testing quickly,
[00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:49.260]   testing early, and treating when treatment is needed.
[00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:50.780]   And also for people who are sick,
[00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.820]   tracing to see who are the other individuals
[00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:53.720]   they interacted with,
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.740]   so they can be properly socially isolated.
[00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:57.820]   Of course, on the science side,
[00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.580]   a lot of brilliant people are working on a treatment,
[00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.860]   on antiviral drugs, on vaccines,
[00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:07.640]   and on the engineering, manufacture, logistics side,
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:10.020]   people are working to manufacture ventilators,
[00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.660]   test kit, protective equipment like masks.
[00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:14.900]   This is a huge global effort.
[00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.500]   Now, the hope is we, in this immediate response,
[00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:19.740]   we flatten the curve,
[00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:22.460]   we don't overwhelm healthcare resources,
[00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.660]   and we minimize the loss of life.
[00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:26.140]   One of the most difficult things here
[00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:29.600]   is for doctors to make life and death decisions.
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.680]   I would like to recommend a book
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.780]   called "Mountains Beyond Mountains" by Tracy Kidder,
[00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:35.380]   which tells the story of Paul Farmer.
[00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:37.980]   It's the first time I realized,
[00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:39.640]   and it might be cliche to say,
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:43.360]   but it really is true that doctors, nurses,
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.820]   and healthcare workers are heroes.
[00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:48.300]   And that book was the first time I realized
[00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:52.660]   that many of the decisions we make are beyond reason.
[00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:55.380]   They're some of the most complicated ethical decisions
[00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:56.220]   you have to make.
[00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:57.180]   You have to listen to your heart,
[00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:58.940]   and those are the decisions,
[00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.620]   deeply human decisions that doctors have to make.
[00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:06.240]   And at this biological, this medical level of life,
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.460]   of human life and human death,
[00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:12.300]   doctors are really, and nurses and health workers,
[00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:14.580]   are really at the front lines
[00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:17.500]   of making those most difficult decisions.
[00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.380]   That is such an important fight.
[00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:20.760]   They truly are heroes.
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:22.440]   I recommend the book highly
[00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:25.540]   to highlight the burden that these folks have to carry.
[00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:27.700]   Now, the hope is, if the response is swift,
[00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:29.180]   and we all do our part,
[00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:30.260]   that this turns out to be
[00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.580]   as close to the best case as possible.
[00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:34.540]   And then it serves as a dress rehearsal
[00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:36.340]   for a much worse pandemic
[00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:38.300]   that could cost a lot more,
[00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:43.300]   both economic impact and the loss of human life.
[00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:46.700]   And that means we can now look into the future
[00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:47.980]   and invest in science,
[00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:49.940]   invest in the healthcare infrastructure,
[00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:52.260]   such that future responses can be much more swift,
[00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:53.620]   and we're much more prepared
[00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:56.860]   for something catastrophic, truly catastrophic.
[00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:58.860]   And finally, the hope is
[00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:00.980]   that we can discuss the role of technology
[00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:03.220]   in all of this in the years to come.
[00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:05.160]   Information truly is power
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:07.920]   in controlling the spread of a pandemic,
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.100]   but information, data,
[00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:11.300]   is something that requires
[00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:14.900]   that we strike a balance between privacy and health.
[00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:17.460]   And that requires a discussion about who controls,
[00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:20.540]   who manages, who regulates the technology
[00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:22.820]   in terms of how privacy is preserved.
[00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:26.100]   The second level of which the virus is attacking our society
[00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:28.460]   is the individual human emotion.
[00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:29.700]   Fear is real.
[00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:31.060]   Fear of losing your job,
[00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:32.100]   fear of losing your health
[00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:33.820]   or the health of the loved ones,
[00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:35.220]   fear of losing basic resources
[00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:37.900]   like water and food and power.
[00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:39.900]   And there also could just be fundamentally
[00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:41.060]   a fear of uncertainty,
[00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:43.520]   which can lead to tensions within the family
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:46.740]   and within the small inner social circle.
[00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:49.460]   Now, the key there is to stay calm.
[00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:54.460]   It's so important for reason to override emotion,
[00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:58.340]   especially in decision-making.
[00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:02.020]   So stay calm, stay informed.
[00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:03.180]   This might be difficult to say,
[00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:05.520]   but this is also a good time
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.780]   to reevaluate your life journey,
[00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:08.900]   to ask the question,
[00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:10.780]   am I living my dream?
[00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:12.240]   Am I living my passion?
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:17.900]   This is a good time as any for a personal revolution
[00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:19.060]   to start over,
[00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:21.380]   to do the thing you've always wanted to do,
[00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:23.080]   to start writing, to start reading,
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:24.900]   to learn, take an online class,
[00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:27.220]   to pivot in your own personal journey.
[00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:28.540]   If you're a business owner,
[00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:31.000]   to pivot the structure of your business,
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.180]   the thing it's doing,
[00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:35.120]   the underlying ideas behind the business,
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.740]   the scale of the business,
[00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:38.140]   rethink everything.
[00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:40.900]   This is a good time for a personal revolution.
[00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:42.620]   Now, this can be extremely painful,
[00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:44.780]   especially for people living paycheck to paycheck
[00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:46.420]   who have to support a family.
[00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:47.820]   But this is the time.
[00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:48.660]   If there's ever a time,
[00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:50.180]   this is the time to do it,
[00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:52.940]   to rethink what are the coming days,
[00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:55.100]   weeks, and months look like?
[00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:56.460]   How can you change your life
[00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:59.600]   so you can truly live your dream, your passion,
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.020]   and provide for your family,
[00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:03.140]   provide for yourself, provide for your family,
[00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:04.900]   and be the best person you can be?
[00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:07.180]   This is the time for that personal revolution.
[00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:09.120]   Again, it might be very painful,
[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:11.180]   but this is the time for it.
[00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:12.460]   My hope at this level,
[00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:15.020]   at the psychological level of the individual,
[00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:18.260]   is that we use this opportunity
[00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.880]   to reevaluate our lives,
[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:21.940]   to take a leap forward
[00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:24.540]   in something you've always wanted to do.
[00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:29.540]   And in general, my hope is that we overcome fear,
[00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:32.420]   the natural fear of uncertainty,
[00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:35.660]   and lean in, lean into love,
[00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:38.520]   compassion for our fellow human beings.
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:41.180]   Resist the desire to be afraid.
[00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:45.240]   Lean in to being compassionate towards others.
[00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:46.960]   Level three is social.
[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:47.980]   Social distancing,
[00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:49.820]   really should be called physical distancing,
[00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:51.380]   that we're all practicing,
[00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:55.280]   has led us to lean in to rely on social media
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:58.660]   for connection, for basic human connection,
[00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:00.620]   and for information.
[00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:02.660]   So it has served as a gradual replacement
[00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:05.320]   of our own individual thinking,
[00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:07.800]   which is much easier to practice in the physical world,
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:12.800]   and more reliance on the kind of collective cognition,
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:16.860]   the hive mind that's represented by social networks.
[00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:18.260]   And what that results is,
[00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:22.740]   is a magnification of level two attack of the virus,
[00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:25.620]   on the fear and panic that can spread,
[00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:27.800]   like contagion on social networks.
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.100]   So social networks are much more effective
[00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:34.260]   at spreading an individual human emotion,
[00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.800]   such that it becomes a mass human emotion
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:40.660]   of our collective cognition, of our collective mind.
[00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:44.220]   And again, that also applies to not just fear and emotion,
[00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:46.100]   it applies to misinformation,
[00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:49.140]   non-scientific, anti-scientific information,
[00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:51.860]   and of course, conspiracy theories.
[00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:52.860]   So that's another level
[00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:55.500]   at which the virus attacks our society,
[00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:58.680]   and due to the efficiency of social media,
[00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:02.500]   it's perhaps one of the most novel aspects of this pandemic.
[00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:05.740]   Now, the challenge for us at the individual human level
[00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:10.740]   is self-reflection meditation, detach yourself.
[00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:13.500]   Yuval Harari in "21 Lessons for the 21st Century"
[00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:16.620]   talks about this in the last chapter for meditation,
[00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:19.540]   is to detach ourselves from this hive mind,
[00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:23.620]   to think on ourselves, to do the self-reflection,
[00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:26.540]   to hear our own inner voice, inner thoughts,
[00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:29.960]   not allow the wave of information, of panic
[00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:34.660]   that can travel through social media to impact us fully.
[00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:37.200]   It should be something we can simply observe
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:40.500]   as opposed to deeply internalize.
[00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:42.640]   Again, the really important thing here
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:46.300]   is looking, finding, digging for facts.
[00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:48.700]   That means looking at source information,
[00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:50.380]   source scientific information,
[00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:55.380]   as opposed to derived opinion pieces on that information.
[00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:58.700]   And most importantly, think critically on your own.
[00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:01.140]   Just because the group that you're supposed to belong to,
[00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:04.040]   whether that's political or social, thinks a certain way,
[00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:05.920]   doesn't mean you should think that way.
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:10.180]   Remove the power of the hive mind by thinking on your own.
[00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:12.020]   Now, my hope is that this level,
[00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:15.100]   this becomes a jarring wake-up call
[00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:17.920]   of how we use social media as a society.
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:21.020]   One, in terms of controlling the spread of misinformation,
[00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:25.560]   and two, in terms of the way we connect
[00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:28.140]   with other human beings on social media,
[00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:30.200]   as opposed to giving in to the drug,
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:33.300]   the dopamine-fueled drama of social media,
[00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:36.240]   of clicking likes and tracking likes
[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:39.460]   and getting angry at the drama and the tension and so on,
[00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:41.060]   more seeing it as another medium
[00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:42.940]   in which we can encourage deep connection
[00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:45.460]   with other human beings, friendships,
[00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:48.620]   real, positive, good vibes.
[00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:49.660]   It might be naive to say,
[00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:51.020]   but I think it's actually possible.
[00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:52.880]   It's both a technology problem
[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:57.100]   and it's a society problem of how we define the standards
[00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:59.260]   of how we behave in the social world.
[00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.140]   And this is a good wake-up call to look at that.
[00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:03.100]   In a time of panic, we come together,
[00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:05.120]   and there's no reason we can't stay together
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:07.100]   in this kind of way online.
[00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:08.660]   Now, level four is economic,
[00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:11.580]   and this could be the most painful
[00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:13.740]   of the impacts of the virus.
[00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:17.420]   Day by day, the projections are getting worse and worse
[00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:19.100]   from the economists.
[00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:21.620]   Some economists, more and more,
[00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:24.580]   are predicting double-digit drops in GDP
[00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:25.660]   in the second quarter.
[00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:30.200]   The real pain that people are already feeling
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:34.120]   and will feel more and more is the loss of jobs.
[00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:36.100]   Many economists are predicting millions,
[00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:40.100]   three to seven millions of US jobs lost before the summer.
[00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:43.940]   Now, these are jobs in the service industry,
[00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:47.420]   hotel, travel, restaurants.
[00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:49.940]   Many folks are already living paycheck to paycheck.
[00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:53.100]   This is real pain and burden
[00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:55.860]   that a lot of families will have to carry.
[00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:57.180]   And on the small business side,
[00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:58.260]   this is difficult to measure,
[00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:01.100]   but surveys of business owners are saying
[00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:03.620]   that in just three months,
[00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:06.660]   50% of them did not see a way to avoid bankruptcy.
[00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:10.900]   So that's a much longer-lasting impact
[00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:13.620]   on the fabric of our,
[00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:16.180]   the United States capitalist society,
[00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:17.700]   where small businesses in many ways
[00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:19.340]   are the backbone of our society.
[00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:23.420]   The challenge for us as a citizen
[00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:25.100]   is to hold politicians accountable
[00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:28.500]   as they develop a fiscal stimulus package.
[00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:30.300]   It's really important,
[00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:33.820]   drawing lessons from the 2008 financial crisis,
[00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:38.820]   that the bailout, that the fiscal stimulus that passes
[00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:41.900]   is one that benefits the people that need it.
[00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:43.980]   The workers who lose their job,
[00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:46.940]   the small businesses on the verge of bankruptcy.
[00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:50.860]   As a consumer, at least in the United States,
[00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:54.260]   consumer spending is a big part of the US economy,
[00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.260]   the 70%.
[00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.260]   So if you can afford it,
[00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.900]   continuing spending money on things you need,
[00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:03.420]   especially to support local and small businesses.
[00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:06.660]   And finally, as a business, as a small business,
[00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:08.340]   this is an opportunity to reinvent,
[00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:12.340]   to add an online component, to diversify, to pivot.
[00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:14.940]   Now that might be really painful and difficult to say.
[00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:17.700]   I recently left my job,
[00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:21.500]   I was facing a bank account with nothing in it,
[00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:23.700]   and there's a lot of reinvention and pivoting
[00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:24.700]   that was required to do.
[00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:27.860]   I'm working on building a startup that brings in no money,
[00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:31.020]   so I had to figure out how can I make money in the meantime?
[00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:33.220]   Now that kind of thing could be exceptionally painful,
[00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:35.340]   especially if it requires learning skills
[00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:36.500]   that you don't have.
[00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:39.620]   But I think if you face this fear,
[00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:41.740]   taking this step where you reinvent the business
[00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:43.580]   could be the best decision you've ever made.
[00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:45.900]   It could be very painful in the short term,
[00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:50.900]   but exceptionally profitable and liberating in the longterm.
[00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:53.300]   So this is the time, as I mentioned before,
[00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:55.500]   for if you're a small business owner,
[00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:56.980]   for a personal revolution.
[00:16:56.980 --> 00:17:01.180]   Now, my hope is, as it is for everybody else,
[00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:03.340]   that once we reopen our society,
[00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:06.500]   that the fiscal stimulus that not just carries us through,
[00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:09.140]   but allows us to resume consumer spending
[00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:10.380]   as quickly as possible,
[00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:14.620]   so that the recovery is, as they say, a V versus a U,
[00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:18.940]   that it's an immediate and aggressive and quick recovery.
[00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:21.500]   And also, it's a very dark
[00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:23.580]   and perhaps a little bit Russian of me
[00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:25.420]   to think of the silver lining of this,
[00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:28.700]   but one of the positive aspects of the pain
[00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:29.780]   that people are feeling
[00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:34.140]   is that a lot of people are feeling that pain together.
[00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:36.580]   We're in this together.
[00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:39.140]   Majority of the lower class and the middle class
[00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:42.620]   will be feeling the pain of shutting down the economy.
[00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:44.160]   We're in this together.
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:47.900]   There's something, if just a little bit comforting,
[00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:49.100]   that the pain you feel
[00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:51.940]   is the pain that's also felt by your neighbors.
[00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:54.980]   Again, the hope is that it brings us together.
[00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:56.940]   Level five is political.
[00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:59.620]   I think it's not an exaggeration to say
[00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:04.300]   we're living in one of the most divided times politically
[00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:07.220]   in the history of the United States, of our country,
[00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:09.420]   and especially on the heels
[00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:12.740]   of the United States president being impeached
[00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:14.740]   and an election coming up.
[00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:17.460]   It leads to the politicization of everything,
[00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:20.820]   including the virus, and that's a huge pain,
[00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:24.980]   and that's a really damaging attack vector
[00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:27.300]   along which the virus can exploit our society,
[00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:28.500]   at least this nation.
[00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:32.000]   And also, outside of the partisanship,
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.940]   this is a time for the government to pass policy,
[00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:36.420]   to respond to the virus,
[00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:39.060]   and there is, as always through history,
[00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:40.780]   through wars, through pandemics,
[00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:42.660]   through big global crises,
[00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:46.140]   there's a diminishment of our rights and freedoms,
[00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:49.420]   and that is another attack of the virus
[00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:51.660]   on the fabric of our society.
[00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:53.260]   The challenge for our citizen
[00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:57.060]   is to not let charlatans in the government
[00:18:57.060 --> 00:19:01.220]   of any party affiliation capitalize on our fear,
[00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:02.700]   as I described in level two,
[00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:04.880]   the psychological, the emotional,
[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:06.740]   by overreaching power.
[00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:08.380]   So this could look like anything.
[00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:11.000]   It could look like mass surveillance,
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.340]   it could look like martial law,
[00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:15.300]   individual cities, states, federal,
[00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:17.620]   it could look like detaining people without trial,
[00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:19.540]   which we're already starting to see,
[00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:23.900]   and God forbid, canceling elections,
[00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:27.900]   so really attacking the fundamental nature of democracy.
[00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:29.740]   We have seen this throughout history.
[00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:33.380]   As citizens of this democratic nation,
[00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:35.380]   we have to stay vigilant to this threat.
[00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:37.920]   On the scientific front,
[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:39.980]   I think it's really, really important
[00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:43.100]   that we do not look at the coronavirus
[00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:44.260]   through a political lens.
[00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:46.380]   It should not be a red and blue issue.
[00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:48.500]   It should be something where we trust the expert,
[00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:50.140]   the scientific information,
[00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:51.780]   the best data available,
[00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:55.060]   should not be seen through a lens of the partisan divide
[00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:58.420]   that has driven so much of our public discourse
[00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:00.780]   about federal policy,
[00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:04.040]   because the one plus trillion dollar stimulus package
[00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:05.740]   that Congress is trying to pass
[00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:08.660]   is something that can make or break this economy,
[00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:10.480]   or rather, it can make the difference
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:13.340]   between the V and the U shape recovery,
[00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:16.280]   fast recovery or delayed multi-month recovery
[00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:18.220]   where a lot of people will suffer.
[00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:19.820]   It's exceptionally important to get this right,
[00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:22.740]   and politics should not come at all into play
[00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:26.240]   into the decisions being made by our policymakers.
[00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:28.560]   So the hope is, once we beat this thing,
[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:33.220]   is that we rethink the federal infrastructure,
[00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:35.180]   the response to global threats,
[00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:37.020]   really invest back into it,
[00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:40.460]   try to see government in this one regard
[00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:43.700]   as something that could really unite the people
[00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:47.140]   in an effective, timely, quick response.
[00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:50.180]   The hope is we're reminded of the importance of government,
[00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:55.060]   and then we reinvigorate the basic unit of a democracy,
[00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:56.700]   which is the citizen,
[00:20:56.700 --> 00:21:00.780]   and remind us that we can accomplish a lot of things
[00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:02.740]   if we work together,
[00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:05.820]   so not through divisiveness,
[00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:07.620]   but on really big, important issues
[00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:11.280]   and things we really should all agree on working together.
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:12.840]   This is a good reminder,
[00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:14.880]   just like going to the moon was a good reminder
[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:19.220]   of what science and engineering could do at a large scale,
[00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:21.360]   this is what's needed now.
[00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:24.860]   This virus, perhaps, should serve as a good reminder
[00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:27.660]   that good science, good engineering at scale
[00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:30.220]   is essential for us to work together on,
[00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:32.420]   to respond to these kinds of things in the future,
[00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:35.620]   and just to create, progress forward
[00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:38.780]   to make a better world in a lot of different dimensions.
[00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:40.940]   It continues to be a huge surprise to me
[00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:42.620]   that science, not always,
[00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:44.940]   but sometimes, enters the world of politics,
[00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:49.020]   and politicians play games with scientific facts.
[00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:51.020]   They question the validity of findings
[00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:54.300]   of individual personalities in science.
[00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:57.280]   I think people, my hope is that they understand
[00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:00.260]   that, especially the most important questions,
[00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:01.700]   there's thousands of scientists
[00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:03.180]   trying to disprove each other.
[00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:04.960]   This kind of collective mechanism
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:07.780]   is really good at cutting out all the BS
[00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:10.020]   and getting to the core, the truth of things.
[00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:13.580]   Science cannot answer all questions.
[00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:15.980]   There's, to me, some of the most important questions
[00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:19.920]   about ethics is impossible for science to answer,
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:24.920]   but the basic questions of the mechanism
[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:27.940]   that threaten our well-being,
[00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:31.400]   especially in the biological, chemical, and physical world,
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:34.960]   science is really well-equipped to answer,
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:36.660]   and we should not politicize
[00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:39.200]   that extremely powerful mechanism
[00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:42.640]   that can protect us, that can build big, amazing,
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:45.680]   cool things that make our life easier, better,
[00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:47.920]   just create a better world.
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:51.600]   And I hope that we emerge as a society
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:54.160]   that can bicker and politicize everything else,
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:57.720]   but science and scientific experts is something we trust.
[00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:59.700]   Level six is existential.
[00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:03.240]   You can say evolutionary, even.
[00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:06.680]   The human species has not always existed,
[00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:09.800]   and there's no guarantee it will always exist.
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:11.100]   Perhaps this is not the right time
[00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:13.400]   to be deeply thinking about this question.
[00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:16.080]   We wanna deal with the threat at hand,
[00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:18.600]   but I recommend a lot of excellent work
[00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:21.160]   been written on existential risks
[00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:23.000]   from Nick Bostroms and others
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.680]   at the Future of Humanity Institute and other institutions
[00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:29.880]   in general, considering what are the different threats
[00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:32.760]   that our human civilization is facing
[00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:37.120]   in the next hundred years that could lead to extinction
[00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:39.020]   or lead to a large number of people
[00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:41.980]   being either displaced or killed.
[00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:44.320]   Now, this goes everything from global warming
[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:48.320]   to nuclear war to nanotechnology accident
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:50.200]   to molecular nanotechnology weapons,
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:51.680]   so different kinds of weapons,
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:54.040]   to things that I've spoken a lot about,
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:56.360]   think a lot about is superintelligent AI,
[00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:58.480]   artificial general intelligence systems.
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:23:59.900]   And then there's pandemics,
[00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:01.720]   the natural pandemic of coronavirus
[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:03.160]   that we're experiencing now.
[00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:04.200]   And then there's a lot of concern
[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:05.480]   about engineering pandemics,
[00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:08.120]   the kind of risk they pose to our civilization.
[00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:09.940]   The pandemic we're experiencing now
[00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:14.940]   is unlikely to be a species extinction level event,
[00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:18.120]   but it serves as a dress rehearsal,
[00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:22.040]   something that reveals the fragility of our species,
[00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:26.900]   things that feel in the moment, totally unexpected,
[00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:29.300]   and yet are completely expected
[00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:30.900]   if you listen to the experts.
[00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:35.260]   Experts on pandemics are predicting
[00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:39.300]   that there will be a much worse one coming for sure.
[00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:42.680]   For me personally, I work in artificial intelligence.
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:46.700]   I embody a lot of different views,
[00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:49.700]   but certainly because I program and build a lot of systems,
[00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:52.160]   what you call narrow AI systems,
[00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:55.860]   there's a clear awareness of how far we are
[00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:58.780]   from creating superintelligent AI systems.
[00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:02.660]   And I can talk at length about why I see
[00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:06.140]   that as an exceptionally difficult problem on many levels,
[00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:08.260]   especially the kind of AI systems
[00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:11.580]   that could destroy human civilization.
[00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:12.780]   But I think at this level,
[00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:16.340]   the coronavirus pandemic has really changed my mind.
[00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:19.660]   It's given me a wake up call to think more clearly
[00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:23.340]   about the unexpected, that the things that threaten us
[00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:24.860]   may come in ways we don't expect.
[00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:26.540]   So we have to be exceptionally careful,
[00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:30.300]   especially when we work in that particular field.
[00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:32.260]   I'm not an expert in pandemics.
[00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:36.300]   I'm not an expert in molecular nanotechnology,
[00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:40.460]   nor nuclear terrorism, but I am, I hate the word expert,
[00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:43.140]   but I'm somewhat knowledgeable in the world of AI.
[00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:46.020]   And so it's my responsibility to look bigger,
[00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:50.140]   to think bigger about the things that are totally unexpected
[00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:53.860]   that may threaten the wellbeing of many of our,
[00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:56.940]   especially most vulnerable members of our society,
[00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:58.220]   but really everybody.
[00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:00.980]   And so the challenge for us as a society
[00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:02.920]   as we emerge from this pandemic
[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:06.500]   is to invest in scientific research on all of these avenues,
[00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:08.200]   to be prepared way ahead of time
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:11.180]   to some of the threats posed here.
[00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:13.500]   Especially what research does
[00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:16.240]   is it doesn't only reveal mechanism
[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:17.580]   of how we can protect us,
[00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:20.640]   but it reveals the possible vectors of attack
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:21.940]   that could be expected.
[00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:23.680]   So just investing in research,
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:25.740]   getting more people to think about this problem,
[00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:29.740]   I think is exceptionally important to prepare society,
[00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:32.120]   to prepare scientific minds and the tooling,
[00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:34.620]   the engineering, the infrastructure required
[00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:37.940]   to respond to a problem before it kills
[00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:40.700]   a billion or more people.
[00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:42.980]   And finally, level seven, philosophical,
[00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:44.940]   really taking a step back.
[00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:47.020]   It's much more difficult to be eloquent about this,
[00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:51.300]   so I'll mention a book that had a big impact on my life
[00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:55.180]   and rings true in many of its lessons
[00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:57.640]   is "The Plague" by Albert Camus.
[00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:02.000]   Now, in the world that Camus paints in "The Plague,"
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:08.460]   suffering seems to be something that's just a part of life.
[00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:12.140]   And the question that life poses to us
[00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:14.360]   is how do we respond to that suffering?
[00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:15.980]   How do we deal with that suffering?
[00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:19.140]   And at least to me, the lessons I draw from it
[00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:23.740]   is that love for our fellow human beings,
[00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:27.700]   compassion for others is the way we conquer that suffering.
[00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:30.600]   The natural inclination perhaps at first
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:34.180]   is to turn into yourself because everything in life,
[00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:37.460]   in your existence, is going to be a source of pain,
[00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:41.000]   a source of loss, a source of suffering.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.640]   And so you want to isolate yourself,
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:43.720]   you want to separate yourself,
[00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:45.220]   you want to run away from that.
[00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:48.160]   But the reality is somehow that seems to be part
[00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:52.080]   of the human condition is that going into yourself,
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:54.360]   hiding from life, running away from life
[00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:57.480]   is from others, from society,
[00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:02.320]   is actually not a way to remove suffering from your life.
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:07.220]   That somehow stokes the fire of pain, of dread.
[00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:10.200]   And so the way to overcome that,
[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:16.080]   the meaning of life I guess you could say for Camus
[00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:18.480]   is to love others.
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:22.360]   And the book itself serves as an allegory for World War II
[00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:25.520]   and my relatives, the society of the Soviet Union
[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:28.120]   in which I was born in, raised in,
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:32.080]   is so deeply grounded in the story of World War II
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:34.000]   and the pain of World War II.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.440]   And the lessons that emerged there
[00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:39.100]   is that as painful it is to say,
[00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:41.920]   all that suffering, all that death,
[00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:46.920]   what emerges is that love for each other conquers all.
[00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:52.500]   Love of community.
[00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:56.960]   And that's my hope is that we emerge from this
[00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:00.340]   at the highest level from this virus
[00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:03.820]   with a greater sense of community,
[00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:07.180]   with a greater sense for the value of community,
[00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:10.660]   for the love of our fellow human beings,
[00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:14.260]   for the compassion for our fellow human beings.
[00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:18.900]   My hope is that this virus is a reminder
[00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:23.620]   that love is the meaning of life.
[00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:26.780]   Thank you for watching this video.
[00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:29.460]   I hope it's of value for some people.
[00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:30.860]   I hope it helps.
[00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:32.860]   And again, I love you all.
