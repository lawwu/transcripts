[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.700]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.880]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.940]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.200]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, Longangle.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.240]   Longangle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.060]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.620]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.460]   I'm a member of Longangle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.060]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.940]   investments.
[00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.660]   Now, the majority of Longangle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.400]   successful individuals who joined the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.620]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.920]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.220]   investment opportunities.
[00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.140]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.320]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.300]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your
[00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.240]   children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.180]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.460]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.480]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out Longangle and it's
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.780]   totally free to join.
[00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.140]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.980]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.660]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:41.420]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about
[00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.620]   upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.780]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I am excited you're here today for another episode
[00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.020]   where I get to answer all the questions you've sent in.
[00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.380]   And first off, thank you so much for taking the time to write them.
[00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.780]   I'm clearly not doing these often enough, because if I answered all the
[00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.700]   questions I got, we'd have a two or three hour episode.
[00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.980]   So I had an idea.
[00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.180]   Now, whenever I'm describing the show to someone, I talk about how it's about
[00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.380]   a third travel points and miles, about a third money, investing, and other
[00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.420]   personal finance topics, and about a third life, which includes health,
[00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.180]   work, relationships, family, and everything else.
[00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.620]   And I intentionally didn't make the show about any one of those specific
[00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.820]   topics, because I don't think most of you want a weekly
[00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.700]   podcast about just one of them.
[00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.260]   I know I really enjoyed talking about relationships on episode 43, but I just
[00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.460]   don't have the time or frankly, the interest to talk about relationships
[00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:37.820]   every single week.
[00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.860]   So I'm going to try doing a Q&A episode once a month and rotate between the
[00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.060]   topics of travel, money, and life each time.
[00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.780]   So keep your questions coming.
[00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.540]   As most of you who've written in know, I usually try to respond by email to
[00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.620]   anything that's timely or that I won't get to answer soon on an episode like
[00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:56.060]   this.
[00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.500]   You can send them my email, chris@allthehacks.com.
[00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.500]   You can DM me on social, or I just added the ability to record a voice message
[00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.940]   on the All The Hacks website.
[00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.940]   So use that if you want to hear your questions live on the next episode.
[00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.940]   And don't hold back on these questions.
[00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.180]   They can be personal.
[00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.700]   I'm happy to answer almost anything you want to know about my life, finances,
[00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.740]   credit cards, travels, or anything else.
[00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.140]   But today I'm going to start with talking about money.
[00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.780]   First, we'll get into the current market and talk about where to put cash.
[00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.860]   Then I'll tackle investing, questions about dollar cost averaging, tax loss
[00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.540]   harvesting, and backdoor Roth.
[00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.140]   Then we'll jump into a bit more personal finance.
[00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.100]   I'll talk about tracking your net worth, making a financial plan, and saving money
[00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.780]   on gas.
[00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.860]   I'll also share a few listener hacks I've used lately to save money and some great
[00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.100]   deals I've recently found.
[00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.860]   But since we're talking about investing, I have to remind you that I work at
[00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:51.420]   Wealthfront.
[00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.500]   All opinions expressed by me are solely my own opinions and do not reflect the
[00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.460]   opinion of Wealthfront.
[00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.740]   This podcast is for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon for
[00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:01.700]   investment decisions.
[00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.420]   Okay, let's jump in.
[00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:09.140]   While it didn't dominate the questions as much as I'd expected, it seems like I
[00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.860]   couldn't start a money episode like this without talking about the current state of
[00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:13.300]   the market.
[00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.420]   Now, my rule of thumb has always been that if I need money in the next 3-5 years, I
[00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:21.860]   keep it out of the market and in some type of high-yield cash account.
[00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:26.580]   So, while I would prefer the market not to crash like it did this year, I don't need
[00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.020]   the money I have invested for a long time, so as long as the markets continue to go up
[00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.540]   in the long run, which they have for the past 100+ years, I'm okay.
[00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:40.180]   Also, I certainly don't think I'm capable of timing the market, so I'm not even
[00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.300]   trying, and if you want to hear more on that topic, check out episode 59 with Nick
[00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.820]   Mejulie.
[00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.260]   As for what to do with the money you need in the next 3-5 years, now that we're seeing
[00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.620]   some pretty crazy inflation data, it's more important than ever to try to make sure
[00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.500]   you're not just earning the 0.01% you might get in your bank account.
[00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.220]   So, what options do we have?
[00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.900]   One of my favorites is the U.S.
[00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.700]   government Series I savings bonds, which are more commonly known as I-bonds.
[00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.580]   I discussed them a bunch in last week's episode with Jacob Goldstein, so I'll keep
[00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:09.100]   this short.
[00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.860]   They have a current rate of 9.62%.
[00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.820]   You heard that right, 9.62%.
[00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.340]   You do have to buy them on the terrible Treasury Direct site, your money is locked
[00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.820]   up for at least 12 months, and if you hold them for less than 5 years, you forfeit the
[00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:30.060]   last 3 months of interest, though at 9.62% interest, I'm not sure that matters.
[00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:35.340]   And finally, you're limited to $10,000 per person or entity per year, so if you're
[00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:39.540]   married with a revocable trust, which is our situation, that's $30,000.
[00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:44.060]   It is hard to find a return that good, but one where the only major risk is the
[00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:45.860]   financial insolvency of the U.S.
[00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:50.700]   government is like a unicorn for short-term savings, so I'm a huge fan of I-bonds
[00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:51.220]   right now.
[00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:54.540]   We should also talk about high-yield savings accounts.
[00:05:54.540 --> 00:06:00.300]   Given that the effective Fed funds rate is now at 1.58%, high-yield savings rates are
[00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:01.140]   rising too.
[00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:06.980]   I know the cash I have in my Wealthfront cash account is already earning 1.4%, and
[00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:11.700]   according to the FedWatch tool, which I'll link in the show notes, there's a 99.5%
[00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:19.620]   chance that the Fed rate goes up by another 0.75% by July, and an 86% chance it goes up
[00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:23.260]   by another 1.25% by the end of the year.
[00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:28.500]   If that holds true, it wouldn't surprise me if high-yield savings rates don't rise
[00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.540]   above 3% by the end of the year.
[00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:35.220]   And given that most of these accounts are all FDIC-insured, if rates really do get
[00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:40.660]   above 3%, I think this is going to be the best risk-adjusted place to store cash that
[00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:42.540]   you need in the next 3-5 years.
[00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:47.260]   So those are some options for cash, but let's talk a little bit about investing,
[00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:52.780]   because Sam asked what I would do with a windfall in this market, and Sachin asked
[00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:55.260]   about the best way to start dollar-cost averaging.
[00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:59.820]   So I'll start talking about a Vanguard paper that was written about 10 years ago
[00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:02.500]   on this exact topic, and I link to it in the show notes.
[00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:08.700]   Now, mathematically, if the market goes up, on average, in the long term, then the
[00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:13.540]   average daily return will be positive, and therefore, you should invest all of your
[00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:15.940]   money right away not to miss out on the returns.
[00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:20.820]   And any mathematical argument against that would probably have to assume that you can
[00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.300]   time the market or that markets won't go up.
[00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:27.820]   The former, I just assume you can't do, and the latter, I think you wouldn't be
[00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:30.620]   investing in the market in the first place if you didn't assume it would go up.
[00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:35.660]   So that's kind of the mathematical answer, but if you really want to answer the
[00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:40.300]   question, you need to factor in emotions, and for that, dollar-cost averaging has
[00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:43.140]   some psychological advantages you really can't ignore.
[00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:49.100]   For example, if investing everything all at once and seeing it drop 5 or 10% over
[00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:54.060]   the next few days, which has happened a few times so far this year, would make you
[00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:58.700]   miserable and worried and stressed out, then it might be worth investing that money
[00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:03.300]   over time, however, if you're going to dollar-cost average, I would strongly
[00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:08.140]   encourage you to make a plan and commit to it, because too often, I hear people say
[00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:11.980]   things like, "Now that the market is going up, I'm just going to wait for it to go
[00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:16.140]   down a little bit more before I keep investing," and I've seen people wait years
[00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:17.260]   and years and miss out.
[00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:21.940]   So in the past, I've typically done dollar-cost averaging over a shorter period
[00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:26.620]   of time, like 3 to 6 months, but given that I'm actually going to have some cash to
[00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:30.540]   invest in the next 6 months, I might as well share exactly what I plan to do.
[00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:36.180]   Well, first, I'm going to set aside all the money I need to for taxes and put that
[00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:37.460]   into a high-yield cash account.
[00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:42.700]   I think all too often, people forget that when you buy something and sell it at a
[00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:45.780]   gain, you have to pay taxes and no one's withholding that.
[00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:50.260]   I know a lot of people out there who are self-employed and used to making quarterly
[00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:54.380]   estimated payments are familiar, but for people who are used to their employers
[00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:58.780]   taking out their taxes every paycheck, sometimes you can forget that when you
[00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:01.820]   sell something at a huge gain, you owe those taxes.
[00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:06.420]   So for the leftover money, I plan to invest it in my Wealthfront account and I'll
[00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:11.180]   likely do that over a 3-month period and I'll split it 1/3 each month.
[00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:17.100]   However, knowing myself, if after that first investment, the market starts to go
[00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:21.180]   down, I'm likely going to start accelerating the rest of my investments.
[00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:26.540]   While I don't think you can time the dip, I'm not afraid to buy it if I find myself
[00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:27.380]   right in the middle of it.
[00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:31.780]   Okay, on the topic of investing, I got a few other great questions.
[00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:35.820]   But before I get into them, I want to let anyone know who doesn't already get my
[00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:40.060]   newsletter that I'm doing a two-part series right now all about investing.
[00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:44.300]   The first email last week was all about the fundamental considerations you need to
[00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:46.500]   build a foundational investment mind.
[00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:50.100]   And next week, I'll get a bit more advanced and technical about investing.
[00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:54.900]   I know you all get a lot of emails, but I only send mine every 2 weeks and in each
[00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:59.220]   one, I spend a ton of time going deep on something and share all the best deals I've
[00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:00.500]   found in the past few weeks.
[00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:05.740]   So if you're not already subscribed, you can go to allthehacks.com/email to sign up
[00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:08.460]   right now and read any of the past issues.
[00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:13.740]   Okay, the first question is about tax loss harvesting, which I know sounds boring.
[00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:16.820]   But before I get into the question, let me give a quick primer on it.
[00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:22.180]   Let's say you buy $10,000 of VTI, the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF last year,
[00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:24.180]   and it's down 23%.
[00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:28.860]   If you sold it while it was down, you'd have a $2,300 loss that the IRS will
[00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:34.500]   actually let you deduct off your income up to $3,000 a year or against any other
[00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:37.540]   capital gains you have, up to the total value of those gains.
[00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:42.140]   And if you have extra losses, you can carry them over to future years.
[00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:47.820]   It would obviously be great if you could harvest that $2,300 loss now, but I assume
[00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:49.780]   you don't want to actually get out of the market.
[00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:54.020]   Unfortunately, there's a rule called the wash/sale rule that prohibits you from
[00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:57.700]   selling an investment for a loss and replacing it with something substantially
[00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:59.620]   identical within 30 days.
[00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:05.100]   So you can't just sell VTI, capture the loss, and then buy VTI right after.
[00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:11.900]   But the trick is that you can sell VTI, take the loss in 2022, and buy another
[00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:15.620]   index fund like SCHB, which is Schwab's U.S.
[00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:16.740]   Broad Market ETF.
[00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:21.980]   They're not substantially identical, but they're almost perfectly correlated.
[00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:24.500]   So you get the same exposure to the U.S.
[00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:28.540]   markets, but you also get to take advantage of the losses this year.
[00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:30.540]   That's tax loss harvesting.
[00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:34.140]   And Derek Horsmeyer at the Wall Street Journal published an article last year
[00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:39.180]   where his research found that on average, an investor facing a capital gains tax
[00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:46.540]   rate of 25% can juice their equity portfolio's annual return by 1.1 to 1.42
[00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:51.500]   percentage points, meaning if you had an expected return of 5%, tax loss
[00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:55.180]   harvesting could increase it to 6.1 to 6.42%.
[00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:58.420]   So you can see how tax loss harvesting can be really valuable.
[00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:02.860]   And if you have a simple portfolio of a few index funds, you could easily search
[00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:07.300]   online for the tax loss harvesting pairs of other very correlated, but not
[00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:11.220]   substantially identical funds, and then sell one whenever it's down and
[00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:12.260]   replace it with the other.
[00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.940]   But the question I got from Phil took it one step further.
[00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:21.020]   He said, let's say I'm invested in 10 individual stocks and throughout the
[00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:24.060]   year, seven have positive returns and three have negative.
[00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:28.540]   I could definitely sell the three and harvest those losses for tax savings.
[00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:32.580]   But let's say I wanted exposure to something similar to an index fund like
[00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:37.900]   the S&P 500, if I invest in SPY, it's most likely going to have positive
[00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:41.860]   returns for the year, even though a portion of the stocks that make up the
[00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:43.580]   S&P 500 had losses.
[00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:49.580]   Is there a way to invest so that I get exposure to an index fund, but that can
[00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:52.500]   tax loss harvest from the losing stocks of that fund?
[00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:56.420]   Is that even possible since the funds are constantly rebalanced?
[00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:58.540]   That was a great question from Phil.
[00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:02.260]   And while you can't achieve what he's talking about with a mutual fund or an
[00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:06.500]   index fund, what he's asking about is called direct indexing.
[00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:12.060]   And it's where instead of buying the S&P 500 index fund, you actually buy the
[00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:15.580]   entire 500 stocks in the S&P 500.
[00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:21.460]   The only catch is that with 500 stocks, each weighted differently, it would be a
[00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:23.220]   nightmare to manage on your own.
[00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:27.220]   So I really only suggest trying to do this with a software based investing
[00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:27.740]   platform.
[00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:32.540]   Wealthfront offers it for accounts over $100,000, or you can search around the
[00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:34.900]   web and there are other investment firms that offer it.
[00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:39.940]   Another added benefit to direct indexing is that you're not paying the expense
[00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:42.060]   ratio of the index fund.
[00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:47.740]   Now, a lot of broad market US index funds have very, very low expense ratios, so
[00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:52.380]   it's not a huge benefit, but it is a benefit and worth sharing.
[00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:55.740]   There are a couple of white papers out there online if you search for direct
[00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:59.980]   indexing or stock level tax loss harvesting, where you can get a sense of
[00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:01.820]   how it works and the extra benefit.
[00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:05.660]   It is something that I personally have enabled and I think adds value over the
[00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:09.540]   long run, but you should definitely do your homework before you get started.
[00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:15.220]   And since Wealthfront has come up a lot, I just want to be clear that while I work
[00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:19.620]   at Wealthfront, they are not a sponsor of this show, this show is not part of
[00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:23.900]   Wealthfront, I'm not getting paid to talk about Wealthfront, and I don't get any
[00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:26.140]   extra time off to work on the show.
[00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:30.540]   I do, however, love the product, which is probably why I'm still working here
[00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:31.740]   almost three years later.
[00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:36.860]   And in fact, I actually spoke to at least 30 fintech companies before deciding to go
[00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:40.620]   to Wealthfront, and I ended up making that decision because I thought they had the
[00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:41.860]   best products in the market.
[00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:46.900]   In fact, I was already using the product before I started working there, and I am
[00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:51.380]   certainly going to be a user long after working there if or whenever that happens.
[00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:55.340]   So if you ever want to sign up for Wealthfront, I'd obviously love it if you
[00:14:55.340 --> 00:15:00.300]   want to use my personal referral link, allthehacks.com/wealthfront, you'll get
[00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:02.420]   your first $5,000 managed free.
[00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:04.260]   It'll help me reduce my fees.
[00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:08.700]   And yes, even though I'm an employee, I do happily pay fees to Wealthfront also.
[00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:13.900]   I wish I could say that I'm eating a fully balanced diet every day, but the
[00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:15.980]   reality is that I am definitely not.
[00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:20.860]   So I love having an easy way to get my daily nutritional insurance, which is why
[00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:24.900]   I kickstart my day with Athletic Greens, and I am excited to be partnering with
[00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:25.940]   them for this episode.
[00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:29.980]   I started taking it because I wanted to see what all the hype was about, and I've
[00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:32.420]   kept it in my daily routine for months.
[00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:37.260]   Every morning, I mix it up with some cold water, add a few ice cubes, it tastes so
[00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:41.380]   good when it's cold, and I head to my office feeling focused and energized for
[00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:44.220]   the day, which is a feeling I absolutely love.
[00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:48.980]   I also love that it's made from 75 high quality vitamins, minerals, and super
[00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:51.900]   foods, and contains less than one gram of sugar.
[00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:56.060]   It also has no GMOs, nasty chemicals, or artificial anything.
[00:15:56.060 --> 00:16:00.740]   To make giving it a try easy, Athletic Greens is going to give you a free one
[00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:05.660]   year supply of immune supporting vitamin D and five free travel packs with your
[00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:06.700]   first purchase.
[00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:12.020]   All you have to do is visit allthehacks.com/athleticgreens.
[00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:17.700]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/athleticgreens to take ownership over your
[00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:21.020]   health and pick up the ultimate daily nutritional insurance.
[00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:26.100]   You all know I love credit card points, so I'm excited to be partnering with
[00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:30.020]   Card Pointers today, which is one of my favorite tools for travel hacking.
[00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:34.180]   It's a free app that helps you manage all of your credit cards in one place and
[00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:38.820]   makes it easy to find the right card to maximize your category bonuses on every
[00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:39.420]   purchase.
[00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:43.860]   You can also load it on your partner's phone so they always know the best cards
[00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:44.460]   to use.
[00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:49.380]   The app automatically tracks every category bonus and recurring credit from
[00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:55.580]   over 5,000 cards, and they also track and help you use your Amex, Chase, Bank of
[00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:59.660]   America, or Citibank offers to save even more money every day.
[00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:04.460]   With their browser extension, you can actually activate every single Amex and
[00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:06.540]   Chase offer in just one click.
[00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:11.020]   Because of that massive credit card database, you can do all of this without
[00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:13.860]   having to give up any personal or banking details.
[00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:18.820]   The app is free to download, and many of the features are free as well, but if you
[00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:21.380]   want to try out the pro version, there's a free trial.
[00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:25.740]   And if you decide you want to sign up after the trial, which you probably will,
[00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:31.660]   you can go to allthehacks.com/cardpointers to get 20% off.
[00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:36.700]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/cardpointers.
[00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:41.620]   Okay, I got another good investing question about backdoor Roth IRAs.
[00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:46.100]   Robert wrote in asking to clarify if it's still possible to do backdoor Roth
[00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:50.980]   contributions, even if your household income exceeds all contribution limits for
[00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:52.980]   both Roth and traditional IRAs.
[00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:56.860]   Also, he and his wife have fully maxed out their 401k at work.
[00:17:56.860 --> 00:18:01.820]   Obviously, I'm not a CPA, so I'll suggest that you talk to one first, but yes, you
[00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:04.260]   are able to do backdoor Roth contributions.
[00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:09.180]   Even if your household income exceeds all contribution limits, the way it works is
[00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:14.380]   that you make a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA first, which has no
[00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:19.220]   restrictions on income or other retirement contributions because the money is after
[00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:22.780]   tax and you will end up having to pay taxes on the gains.
[00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:27.740]   So practically making non-deductible contributions to a traditional IRA has very
[00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:34.060]   little benefits, except that you can roll those funds over to a Roth IRA with no
[00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:37.940]   taxes due when you roll it over, since the original contributions were not pre-tax.
[00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:43.420]   And once the funds are in a Roth IRA, you won't owe any taxes on the gains.
[00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:48.500]   However, the most important consideration is that if you already have funds in a
[00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:53.540]   traditional IRA, things can get really complicated because you can't specify
[00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:56.460]   which of the funds you want to roll over to the Roth IRA.
[00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:59.980]   So if you're in that circumstance, you should definitely talk to an accountant
[00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:02.580]   first or do some heavy reading online.
[00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:07.180]   When I first learned about the backdoor Roth, I had never made any contributions
[00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:10.100]   to a traditional IRA, so it was really easy.
[00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:16.100]   I put the max in a traditional IRA, which this year is $6,000, and then I waited a
[00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:19.940]   couple of days till everything cleared, and then I rolled it over right away to a
[00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:20.860]   Roth IRA.
[00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:24.100]   There were also a couple of years when I was working at Google that I got really
[00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:27.980]   lucky and I got to take advantage of something called the Mega Backdoor Roth.
[00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:31.940]   This is something that's pretty rare because your employer has to explicitly
[00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:37.140]   allow it in their 401(k) plan, but what it lets you do is make after-tax
[00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:42.380]   contributions to your 401(k), which you'll want to do after you make all of
[00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:44.460]   your pre-tax or Roth contributions.
[00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:48.780]   But again, like making a non-deductible after-tax contribution to your
[00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:53.780]   traditional IRA, there isn't a ton of benefit to doing this on its own because
[00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:57.940]   now you've just made contributions with less liquidity and no tax benefits,
[00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:04.260]   except, just like with the Backdoor Roth, those 401(k) plans usually let you roll
[00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:07.900]   over those contributions to Roth contributions.
[00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:12.020]   Now, why is this so exciting if you could already make a Roth contribution to your
[00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:12.980]   401(k)?
[00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:17.540]   Well, when we often talk about the maximum contribution to a 401(k), we just
[00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:23.540]   hear the number $20,500, but that's actually the tax-advantaged contribution
[00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:27.260]   limit, so that's how much you can put in pre-tax or into a Roth 401(k).
[00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:32.660]   The actual limit for contributing to a 401(k) is $61,000.
[00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:39.060]   So if you've already maxed out your $20,500 and your plan allows you to make
[00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:44.380]   after-tax contributions and your plan allows you to roll those after-tax
[00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:51.540]   contributions over into a Roth 401(k) or out of your 401(k) into a Roth IRA, then
[00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:58.020]   you can conceivably invest about $40,000 more into your 401(k) and convert them
[00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:02.300]   into Roth investments and not owe any taxes on those investments.
[00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:07.780]   So if you have the income and the savings rate to support this, a Backdoor Roth or
[00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:12.500]   a Mega Backdoor Roth can be an amazing way to set aside money in an account where
[00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:14.900]   you won't have to pay any taxes on the gains.
[00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:18.860]   And you don't just have to put those accounts at a brokerage firm like you're
[00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:23.060]   used to, if you look online at self-directed IRAs, there are actually a
[00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:28.180]   handful of companies out there who will let you use your Roth IRA to invest in
[00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:32.900]   lots of different things, be it crypto or other illiquid assets.
[00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:35.380]   So there's really a lot of flexibility with Roth IRAs.
[00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:39.060]   And because you can choose where you invest the money, you're not going to
[00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:44.020]   find the same fees that you see in 401(k)s, which many times can be really,
[00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:44.660]   really high.
[00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:45.380]   Okay.
[00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:46.380]   I know that was a lot.
[00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:50.180]   So feel free to go online and just Google around for Backdoor Roth, Mega
[00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:53.140]   Backdoor Roth, and read a little bit more about it or send me follow-up
[00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:53.660]   questions.
[00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:54.700]   I'd love to help out.
[00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:55.740]   Okay.
[00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:59.900]   Final question on investing was from Noam, who asked me if I knew any great
[00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:03.580]   resources for sophisticated investors who want to continue learning.
[00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:07.180]   I'll give a shout out to my two favorite investing podcasts here.
[00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:11.420]   First is Animal Spirits, which is co-hosted by Ben Carlson, who I interviewed
[00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:16.260]   on episode 42, and it covers a lot of personal finance, markets, and investing
[00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:16.860]   topics.
[00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:19.300]   Second, Macro Voices.
[00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:23.380]   It's a much more technical investing podcast that's primarily for
[00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:26.580]   professional finance, high net worth individuals, and sophisticated
[00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:27.180]   investors.
[00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:28.740]   But I really love it.
[00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:33.260]   And I've learned a lot about oil, gold, inflation, and so much more.
[00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:34.820]   So definitely check those out.
[00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:38.140]   And if you have other recommendations, please send them my way and I'd love to
[00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:39.500]   share them in a future episode.
[00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:40.300]   Okay.
[00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:42.860]   So this next question hit a sore spot for me.
[00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:47.500]   Ruth asked, "If I want someone to help me make a complete financial plan, which
[00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:52.180]   would include investing, tax strategy, and retirement planning, is there such a
[00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:53.460]   person or company?
[00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:57.300]   It seems like you have to go to your tax guy, your investment person, and a
[00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:59.180]   retirement person all separately."
[00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:04.220]   So the reason why this one made me a bit sad is that my last Startup Grove was
[00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:06.100]   built to do precisely this.
[00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:09.300]   We helped clients make a comprehensive financial plan.
[00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:13.180]   We wouldn't necessarily file their taxes or set up their estate plan.
[00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:15.220]   But we would advise on all of it.
[00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:20.180]   And our goal was to leverage software to make this process much more efficient and
[00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:22.620]   affordable than anything else out there.
[00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:27.740]   But unfortunately, it turns out most people who want to do financial planning
[00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:30.980]   don't actually want to prioritize doing it right now.
[00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:34.140]   And so it was just way too hard to acquire customers.
[00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:37.460]   We would have people sign up and say, "I really want to get started."
[00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:39.380]   And we'd say, "All right, so let's get started."
[00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:42.100]   And then months would go by before anything happened.
[00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:44.620]   So the business didn't actually work.
[00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:49.060]   However, just because it's not a good venture capital-backed software business
[00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:51.100]   doesn't mean it's not a good business.
[00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:55.620]   And there are a ton of good financial planners out there who do exactly this.
[00:23:55.620 --> 00:24:00.180]   I would say you should expect to spend about a few thousand dollars to go through
[00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:02.660]   the comprehensive financial planning process.
[00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:07.300]   And if you're looking for someone to help, I recommend finding a CFP or Certified
[00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:08.300]   Financial Planner.
[00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:13.540]   And there's a great directory of many of them at xyplanningnetwork.com.
[00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:15.580]   And I'll add that link in the show notes.
[00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:19.420]   The great thing about getting a CFP is they're almost always acting as what's
[00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:23.380]   called a fiduciary, which means they are legally required to act in your best
[00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:23.900]   interest.
[00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:28.100]   It's the best question that you should ask anyone who's helping you with your
[00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:29.980]   finances and especially your investments.
[00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:32.340]   It's just, are you a fiduciary?
[00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:34.180]   If the question is yes, that's great.
[00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:37.020]   That means they're going to help you out and be acting in your interest.
[00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:41.460]   And if the answer is anything else, like I always look out for my customers, but it
[00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:44.140]   doesn't actually include a yes, you should be concerned.
[00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:48.860]   If you want a specific recommendation for someone to work with, and I'm not getting
[00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:53.580]   paid for this, I'm a bit partial to a guy named George Gallet at Wealth Foundry.
[00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:55.260]   I'll link to it in the show notes.
[00:24:55.260 --> 00:25:00.460]   He was one of the top financial planners at Grove and he left to start his own firm.
[00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:03.740]   He's a CFP who also has his master's in taxation.
[00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:06.460]   I think he's definitely worth having an intro call with.
[00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:10.340]   If it sounds like it'd be a good fit and make sure to say hi for me, because I
[00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:11.580]   think he's fantastic.
[00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:12.660]   Okay.
[00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:15.500]   Next question is about tracking all of your finances.
[00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:20.340]   Hrishi asked specifically about whether there was a tool to track crypto
[00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:24.140]   investments across multiple apps and wallets, but I want to expand that to
[00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:26.780]   tracking all of my accounts, including crypto.
[00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:30.580]   The unfortunate news is that there isn't a perfect solution.
[00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:35.140]   I could spend a whole episode talking about why account linking between different
[00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:36.500]   apps is so broken.
[00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:41.140]   And between my colleague, Ben and I, if we don't have a lot of gray hairs yet, at
[00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:45.500]   least half of all the ones we do, you can probably attribute to working with
[00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:48.940]   account linking providers and fixing all the issues that come up with it.
[00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:54.220]   So I've tried everything out there from what I helped build at Wealthfront to
[00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:59.420]   Mint, to Personal Capital, to the premium app, Kubera, to the crypto focused asset
[00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:02.980]   dash, and ultimately there's no perfect solution for everything.
[00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:04.940]   And it really depends on what you need.
[00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:10.620]   I'm less focused on budgeting and more focused on seeing my net worth across all
[00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:14.540]   my banking and investment accounts, including my home and my mortgage.
[00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:19.140]   And for that, I think Wealthfront is the best and I use it to model out my future
[00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:22.940]   net worth, factoring in retirement and my kids' college educations.
[00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:29.260]   However, I haven't found a tool that does that and crypto, so I also use asset dash
[00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:33.220]   to track my wallets and NFTs and I add them manually to Wealthfront.
[00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:38.540]   Unfortunately, no one seems to support BlockFi either, so I have to manually add
[00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:41.620]   that as well and update those balances when they change.
[00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:46.980]   I used to keep a spreadsheet to do more analysis for everything, but I realized I
[00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:51.620]   wasn't actually getting any real value from all that tracking, so I just stopped.
[00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:53.820]   And it's so much easier.
[00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:57.580]   And if you're listening and there's an app or a service or a tool that you think
[00:26:57.580 --> 00:27:00.260]   does this better, definitely reach out and let me know.
[00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:03.580]   And if you're really the kind of person that loves tracking this in Google
[00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:06.580]   Sheets, one app you should check out is called Tiller.
[00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:08.140]   I'll link to it in the show notes.
[00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:12.220]   And it basically lets you link all of your accounts and import all that
[00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:14.420]   data directly into a Google Sheet.
[00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:16.940]   So if that's you, definitely check that out.
[00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:21.780]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:22.540]   I get it.
[00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:26.780]   Life comes at you fast, but trust me, your friends are probably
[00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:28.100]   desperate for a good hang.
[00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:32.140]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:37.500]   Just make sure you do it the easy way and let our sponsor Drizly, the go-to app for
[00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:39.580]   drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:42.620]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:44.460]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:48.860]   It could be your dog's birthday, that the sun finally came out, or maybe you just
[00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:51.380]   want to celebrate that you got through another week.
[00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:56.020]   With Drizly, you can make hosting easy by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:59.060]   which means you can entice your friends to leave their houses
[00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:00.940]   without ever leaving yours.
[00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:04.860]   And since I know you like a good deal, Drizly compares prices on their massive
[00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:08.100]   selection of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:11.460]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails while we were hosting family
[00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:16.060]   last week, not only could I get an Italian Amaro delivered in less than an hour, but
[00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:19.100]   I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:24.100]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizly app or go to drizly.com.
[00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:28.020]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:31.380]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:36.660]   I just want to thank you quick for listening to and supporting the show.
[00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:39.500]   Your support is what keeps this show going.
[00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:44.900]   To get all of the URLs, codes, deals, and discounts from our partners, you can go to
[00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:50.900]   allthehacks.com/deals, so please consider supporting those who support us.
[00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:52.140]   Okay.
[00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:55.380]   Moving to something else, I want to talk about spending money on gas.
[00:28:55.380 --> 00:29:00.660]   This one is fun, but I should caveat that while the only gas power vehicle I have is
[00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:05.780]   a Vespa with a two gallon tank, I am well aware of how high gas prices are right now.
[00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:09.740]   And in fact, I don't think I've seen anything under $6 a gallon in the Bay Area.
[00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:14.780]   So when another Chris wrote in asking for hacks on saving money on gas, I wanted to
[00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:18.460]   pull all my favorites together because it wasn't that long ago that I didn't have a
[00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:20.780]   Tesla and I was spending money at the pump.
[00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:26.460]   So number one, does it make sense to take the cash discount when you're buying gas?
[00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:30.340]   Most of the time, it's around 10 cents a gallon, and I used to think that that was
[00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:31.340]   worth considering.
[00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:37.100]   But when you look at $6 a gallon gas, it works out to less than 2% of a discount.
[00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:40.100]   So I would much rather prioritize getting rewards on a credit card.
[00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:43.980]   But so many people ask, what is the best card for gas?
[00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:45.460]   And I'll give you two options.
[00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:50.380]   So my favorite card for gas is the Citi Premier because you get three X points on
[00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:55.100]   gas and Citi has 14 airline and two hotel transfer partners.
[00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:57.060]   So the points can be really valuable.
[00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:59.300]   But it's not just three X on gas.
[00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:03.660]   You get three X on restaurants, airlines, hotels and groceries.
[00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:08.700]   It's one of the best lineups out there, and it only has a $95 annual fee.
[00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:14.180]   And best of all, it currently has the highest signup bonus the card has ever seen at
[00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:18.260]   80,000 points for spending 4,000 in the first three months.
[00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:23.300]   The points guy value Citi points at 1.8 cents, which makes that signup bonus worth
[00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:25.340]   $1,440.
[00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:31.180]   So if you want to learn more about that card or just sign up, go to allthehacks.com/citi
[00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:36.540]   or you can find it at the top of allthehacks.com/cards, where I link to all my
[00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:39.180]   favorite cards and the top signup bonuses right now.
[00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:45.660]   However, if you already have a Chase Freedom or Freedom Flex card, this Q3, July to
[00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:50.740]   September, you can get 5% back or if you have a Chase Sapphire card, that's actually
[00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:54.700]   five X points on the first $1,500 you spend on gas.
[00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:57.740]   You just need to enroll at chasebonus.com.
[00:30:57.740 --> 00:31:03.300]   OK, number two, aside from just optimizing your card spending, I'm a huge fan of Gas
[00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:06.460]   Buddy. And every time I rent a car, I have the app pulled up.
[00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:11.740]   It's crazy how you can find massive differences in gas prices without having to go
[00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:15.020]   too far out of your way, especially when you're returning a rental car.
[00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:19.100]   And by the way, we're going to be having some amazing rental car hacks on next week's
[00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:25.140]   episode. Number three, there are a lot of fuel reward programs out there, and if you
[00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:29.700]   can find one at a station where you don't have to pay a premium, then I'm all for it.
[00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:34.060]   I know for myself, I bought a ton of gas at Safeway and Costco in the past.
[00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:39.380]   Number four, finally, I definitely recommend considering an electric vehicle.
[00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:44.300]   I know it's not a quick fix, but some electric companies like PG&E out in
[00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:50.020]   California have special rate plans if you have an EV, which actually make our entire
[00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:52.020]   energy costs so much cheaper.
[00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:53.420]   So it's a double win.
[00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:58.700]   On the topic of money, I want to share two great money hacks that I've gotten from
[00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:02.300]   listeners, and I've actually used both myself in the past few months.
[00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:07.700]   The first is an example of stacking deals for a purchase I made that was inspired by a
[00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:09.340]   bunch of tips I got from Mike.
[00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:11.980]   So if you're listening, thank you so much.
[00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:15.900]   It was for a purchase at Lowe's, but if you don't live near one, it's a Home Depot
[00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:20.180]   competitor, and the principles of this deal can apply to so many other retailers.
[00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:25.140]   So we're remodeling our bathroom in our house, and I really wanted to put a nice
[00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:27.060]   Japanese toilet in the bathroom.
[00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:29.580]   And if you know what I mean, you totally get it.
[00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:33.780]   And if not, I am so excited for you to have that experience someday in the future.
[00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:38.420]   Anyways, the purchase was going to come out to a thousand and sixty dollars, and
[00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:40.820]   obviously I wanted the best deal.
[00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:46.660]   So first, I went to LowesCouponCode.com, which I found searching online, and I
[00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:49.380]   bought a 10% off coupon for $1.99.
[00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:53.500]   They also had Home Depot, Crate and Barrel, and all kinds of other coupons.
[00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:58.740]   Then I went over to Cashback Monitor to see who offered the most cash back at Lowe's.
[00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:02.540]   Turns out this time it was RetailMeNot with 3% back.
[00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:04.660]   So I clicked the Lowe's link from their site.
[00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:08.060]   And then finally, I searched for the item and added it to my cart.
[00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:12.900]   I applied the coupon, brought the total down to $953.87.
[00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:14.740]   So I didn't stop there.
[00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:21.100]   I went to Amazon and I bought $950 of Lowe's e-gift cards, which get delivered
[00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:24.220]   immediately and can actually be used in-store as well.
[00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:31.420]   Now in Q2, the Chase Freedom bonus was 5x at Amazon, but otherwise I would have used
[00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:36.780]   my Amazon Prime Visa for 5% cash back, which is fantastic because stores like
[00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:40.220]   Home Depot and Lowe's almost never get a bonus on spending.
[00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:44.780]   So a few minutes later, when the email comes in, I put the gift cards on the
[00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:50.220]   Lowe's site and bring the final balance down to $3.87, which I put on my Capital
[00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:51.100]   One Venture X.
[00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:55.700]   Now you can actually buy a Lowe's gift card on Amazon for the exact amount you
[00:33:55.700 --> 00:34:00.020]   need, but I wanted to leave a little balance because you're actually covered
[00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:04.460]   for purchase protection and extended warranties on credit cards if you have
[00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:06.380]   at least some of the purchase on your card.
[00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:11.060]   Then I just checked out, I was done, and the whole process probably
[00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:12.620]   only took 10 minutes tops.
[00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:17.100]   But the result, if I had put the whole purchase just on my Venture X, I would
[00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:23.140]   have paid $1059.85, but after the coupon and cash back, I ended up only paying
[00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:28.420]   $923.82 for $130 savings, which is about 12%.
[00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:33.260]   And because of the 5x at Amazon, I'll earn an extra 2,600 points.
[00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:37.380]   And that doesn't include any of the satisfaction I got for getting a great
[00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:37.820]   deal.
[00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:43.260]   Not bad for a few minutes of work, but just to be clear, if this was a 10, 20,
[00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:47.540]   100, or even $200 purchase, I probably wouldn't have put in as much work.
[00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:50.980]   The other hack I got was from JB.
[00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:56.020]   He had heard me talking about how it can be a huge pain to use up any of those
[00:34:56.020 --> 00:35:00.060]   Visa or Amex gift cards that someone gives you as a gift, and he shared that
[00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:05.100]   you can actually add any amount from a card to your Amazon gift card balance.
[00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:10.540]   So I've had this Amex gift card sitting in a drawer for a few years with less
[00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:13.940]   than $5 on it because I couldn't bring myself to throw it out.
[00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:20.580]   I also didn't have any purchase that was like $4.70, but in just a few seconds, I
[00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:24.820]   pulled up on Amazon, added the exact balance to my account, and I could throw
[00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:25.620]   the card away.
[00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:27.420]   Thank you so much, JB.
[00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:32.660]   Okay, in the spirit of sharing deals, there are a bunch of free premium
[00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:37.780]   subscriptions, statuses, and perks you can get right now just by being a member of
[00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:39.740]   certain cards or services.
[00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:43.660]   So I want to make sure I share them all so you can sign up if you're eligible.
[00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:48.340]   I know I've already signed up for a few, and I'll put the links to anything you
[00:35:48.340 --> 00:35:51.820]   need in the show notes so you don't have to go searching for them.
[00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:56.620]   So first, if you're an Amazon Prime member, you're eligible for a free one
[00:35:56.620 --> 00:36:00.420]   year Grubhub Plus membership, which gets you $0 delivery fees.
[00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:05.660]   I love this deal because I have the Amex Gold, which has a $10 monthly credit
[00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:07.060]   eligible for Grubhub.
[00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:12.180]   Huge shout out to all the Hacks listener, Austin, who emailed me and happens to be
[00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:13.820]   the PM on this deal.
[00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:18.860]   Next, if you have Disney Plus, which includes those of you like me who get it
[00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:24.460]   for free with their Verizon plan, you can get six months of free Uber One, which
[00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:30.260]   also gets you $0 delivery fees on Uber Eats and 5-10% off eligible Uber rides
[00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:31.340]   and Uber Eats orders.
[00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:36.420]   This one also pairs well with the Amex Gold and also the Platinum, because both
[00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:40.300]   of those cards give you an Uber credit each month that I end up using almost
[00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:41.900]   exclusively on Uber Eats.
[00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:44.820]   You just need to sign up by August 17th.
[00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:50.260]   Okay, if you have a Capital One card, this one is pretty amazing, and I'm 100%
[00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:51.020]   going to be using it.
[00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:55.940]   Cardholders get a free six-month membership to The Cultivist, which I'd
[00:36:55.940 --> 00:37:01.980]   never heard of before, but it gives you and three guests free access to over 100
[00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:03.420]   museums around the world.
[00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:05.580]   But they're not just random museums.
[00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:09.580]   They include the Louvre in Paris, the MoMA in the Guggenheim in New York, the
[00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:12.580]   Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, and a lot more.
[00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:17.460]   But after the six months free, you'll start paying $40 a month, so make sure to
[00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:18.900]   set a reminder to cancel.
[00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:24.140]   And also, the offer is available through June 2024, so I'd wait to sign up until
[00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:25.500]   you're sure you're ready to use it.
[00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:27.980]   The last two are for Chase cardholders.
[00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:33.180]   First, you can get free Instacart Plus, which gives you $0 delivery fees, lower
[00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:35.740]   service fees, and 5% back on pickup.
[00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:39.060]   The length of the free membership depends on your card.
[00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:44.300]   Sapphire Reserve gets 12 months, Sapphire Preferred gets six months, and Freedom,
[00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:47.300]   Freedom Flex, and Freedom Unlimited all get three months free.
[00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:52.380]   Next, if you have a Chase Sapphire Reserve, you can get three months of free
[00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:57.180]   Marriott Gold status, which is their second elite tier, and offers you 2 p.m.
[00:37:57.180 --> 00:38:03.460]   late checkout, 25% bonus points, upgrades to non-suite rooms, and a welcome gift of
[00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:04.740]   bonus points at check-in.
[00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:09.380]   While three months isn't that much, if you can complete three stays within three
[00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:13.460]   months of registering, which you have to do by the end of September, you'll keep
[00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:15.980]   that status through February 2024.
[00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:20.220]   But if you have an Amex Platinum, you already get Marriott Gold for free, so
[00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:22.220]   this probably won't be very interesting to you.
[00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:27.620]   I hope at least one of those deals helps you save money or get a cool upgrade.
[00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:31.340]   The only other big deal I wanted to share this week was the Citi Premier card
[00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:35.540]   because it has a huge sign-up bonus, but I already talked about it earlier in this
[00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:40.300]   episode, so don't forget to check that out or visit allthehacks.com/citi if
[00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:41.020]   you're interested.
[00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:46.500]   Also, I want to give a big shout-out to Stephanie, who used the hotel email hack
[00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:50.940]   we discussed in Episode 1 and that Julia Menez shared a template for in Episode
[00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:54.820]   55 to score big on a recent trip to Santa Cruz.
[00:38:54.820 --> 00:39:00.860]   With just one single email, she got hooked up with free parking, an upgrade to a
[00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:06.060]   room with an amazing view, three coupons for a free breakfast, a voucher for food
[00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:09.820]   and drink at the bar, and two craft cocktails delivered to her room.
[00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:14.180]   If you're not using that hack for your next hotel stay, you absolutely should.
[00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:15.620]   So way to go, Stephanie.
[00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:19.820]   Also, thank you to everyone listening, writing in, reading the newsletter,
[00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:23.220]   subscribing on YouTube, and just supporting the show in general.
[00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:27.380]   It means so much to me, and I'm so excited to keep helping you all upgrade
[00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:30.860]   your lives, money, and travel over the years to come.
[00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:34.780]   As always, if there's a topic you want me to cover or a guest you want to hear on
[00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:36.620]   this show, please let me know.
[00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:40.700]   And I do have one favor to ask you all, and it'll only take you a
[00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:42.420]   minute and doesn't cost a thing.
[00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:46.140]   I'm up for the People's Choice Podcast Awards, and I really think I have
[00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:47.580]   a shot at winning with your help.
[00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:50.620]   The site is a bit of a pain because you have to create an account,
[00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:52.460]   but it's really quick after that.
[00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:57.420]   You can get there by going to allthehacks.com/vote, and you can vote for all
[00:39:57.420 --> 00:40:01.420]   the hacks in the People's Choice Award and the Education category.
[00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:05.740]   As silly as it may sound, being an award-winning podcast really helps with
[00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:07.700]   recruiting the best guests for the show.
[00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:10.420]   So thank you so much in advance for your help.
[00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:15.980]   And that wraps up this mailbag episode, or should it be a Q&A or an AMA?
[00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:18.540]   I'm not sure, but I really enjoy doing them.
[00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:20.580]   So please keep those questions coming.
[00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:25.380]   The next two I'll do will be on travel points, miles, and everything else from
[00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:28.300]   life to work to relationships and everything in between.
[00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:33.900]   You can send any and all questions to me, chris@allthehacks.com, or DM me on
[00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:38.300]   Instagram or Twitter, my next episode will be a huge deep dive on everything
[00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:41.220]   you could ever want to know about saving money on rental cars.
[00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:42.820]   So I'll see you next week.
[00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:43.340]   Bye.
[00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:44.060]   Bye.
[00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:49.060]   Bye.
[00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:59.060]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
