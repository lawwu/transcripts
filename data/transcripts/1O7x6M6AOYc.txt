[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:10.340]   - Children notwithstanding, point redemption regardless,
[00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.920]   if you could, today's Tuesday, if I could say to you,
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.880]   hey, look, there's no work on Friday,
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.240]   you and your wife can hop on,
[00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.120]   just go to San Francisco airport,
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.640]   take any flight anywhere in the world Thursday evening
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.620]   for a long, long weekend, where would you like to go to?
[00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.060]   - Just the two of us or just the two of us?
[00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.760]   Let's assume for the moment that it's just the two of you.
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.400]   Am I also assuming that for some reason
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.600]   there's a nonstop flight anywhere in the world?
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.960]   - That's a fantastic advanced level question.
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.560]   Let's assume no, we're gonna play it on hard level,
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.200]   not like magical level, let's be realistic.
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.840]   - That's a great question, the reason I ask
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.840]   is I've always wanted to go to the Canary Islands
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.100]   and they seem quite difficult to get to from the West Coast.
[00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.740]   I think, and how long are we going for?
[00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:06.060]   - You're going for the long weekend,
[00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.420]   so you fly out on Thursday night
[00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.580]   and you'll be back either Sunday or Monday.
[00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.280]   - I'm gonna have to think about this.
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.940]   - Well, I have my answer 'cause I prepared,
[00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.020]   can I tell you my answer?
[00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.980]   - Yeah.
[00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.300]   - So I've been dying to go to Buenos Aires and here's why,
[00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.940]   there's a direct flight from many places,
[00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.860]   probably from San Francisco, from Houston, from New York,
[00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.600]   it's in the same time zone.
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.020]   And so you can take the flight at like 10 p.m.
[00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.620]   and you land, it's like a 10 hour flight
[00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.760]   and you land at 10 a.m. local time,
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.160]   you've not missed any time, there's no jet lag per se.
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.200]   To me, it seems like the most perfect
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.700]   like whole new world environment
[00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.240]   and it's currency arbitrage because right now
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.160]   with not only the strong dollar,
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.480]   but just the rampant inflation there
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.800]   and all the other stuff,
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.280]   it now does open up some interesting times
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.000]   for the dollar traveler to get exceptional value.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.200]   - Yeah, we did a trip to Buenos Aires,
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.060]   I don't know if this is still the case,
[00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.520]   I should be prepared, but I didn't know this was coming.
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.080]   But at the time there were two exchange rates.
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.600]   So there's the, I think it was like the dollar blue,
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.340]   which is like the off market exchange rate
[00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.180]   and then the one you get.
[00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.840]   So you never, at least at the time,
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:22.880]   please fact check all this,
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.120]   at the time you never wanna pay with a credit card
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.960]   because they're going at the bank rate.
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.820]   But the other rate was like half the price.
[00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.160]   So you would basically like walk down the street
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.860]   and someone be like, you need currency, you need exchange,
[00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.000]   and you'd walk into some random place.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.120]   I remember at the time I was like watching YouTube videos
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.000]   on like how to test the currency if it's real
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.640]   because everyone's buying all their currency
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.860]   in like back alleys and now there's WhatsApp groups
[00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.080]   and you'd message them and they'd come to your hotel.
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.720]   But I can only imagine that if inflation has gone rampant,
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:51.560]   the dollar has gone more valuable,
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.760]   it's even more valuable to do this.
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:54.800]   - I second that.
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.680]   The only thing I'd say is we went to Argentina,
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.780]   Buenos Aires is awesome.
[00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:58.620]   It's incredible.
[00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:59.960]   It's one of the few places in the world,
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.320]   maybe New Orleans is similar,
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.160]   where people will say,
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.160]   "Oh, you've gotta check out the cemeteries,"
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.640]   which is a strange thing to recommend,
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.180]   but they're just so interesting and different
[00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.680]   than you've seen anywhere and beautiful and ornate.
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.080]   But there's just so much cool stuff in Argentina
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.720]   that I wish that you would have more time
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.040]   than a weekend to go there.
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.840]   But I did do an episode for you to listen to
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.440]   with the basketball player, Manu Ginobili,
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.560]   who's from Argentina,
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.660]   where he talked about some of his favorite tips.
[00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.140]   So check that out before you go.
[00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.980]   - I always love to.
[00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.320]   - I also did a similar trip for a long weekend to Bogota,
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.760]   which was awesome.
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.600]   Even closer, same time zone, really accessible.
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.580]   Gosh, I don't know where I would go for a long weekend.
[00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.420]   - So let me throw some ideas out of there.
[00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:47.260]   Is that okay?
[00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.080]   - Yeah, go for it.
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.920]   - Would you guys go to Hawaii?
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.540]   - We are going to Hawaii in a few months,
[00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.400]   so I feel like I would not go there this weekend
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.160]   if it was a surprise adventure.
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.080]   - 10, would you go to Japan?
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.160]   - 100%, but Japan is not open right now.
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.400]   - That's right, oh, you're right, you're right, you're right.
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.240]   Okay.
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.840]   - So Japan would always be the number one on the list.
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.360]   It's like, if you want to go on a trip,
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.040]   we're always like, is Japan possible?
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.880]   If not, we'll look at the rest of the world.
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:10.720]   - Yes.
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:11.540]   Would you go to Bangkok?
[00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.680]   Would you do anything in Southeast Asia?
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.640]   - Yeah, so we're actually talking, this is so funny,
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:16.560]   all the things you mentioned.
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.480]   So we're talking about taking a trip
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.060]   maybe October, November for a couple weeks
[00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.940]   with kids and au pair.
[00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.140]   And the plan was to go to Japan, but because it's closed,
[00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:30.300]   now we're talking about Bali or Vietnam or Thailand
[00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.120]   because we had so much fun there.
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.260]   The trip, if you hadn't constrained it to a weekend,
[00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:35.660]   would be, let's go to New Zealand.
[00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.360]   I've heard incredible things about New Zealand,
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.800]   nonstop flight, crazy long,
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.540]   way more manageable without children than with,
[00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.260]   and that would be the place.
[00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.720]   But I just couldn't imagine going all the way there
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.720]   and then turning around three days later and coming back.
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.980]   So that would have been my go-to
[00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.140]   had that not been the constraint.
[00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:57.220]   - I love the New Zealand.
[00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.580]   Is there any place in South America or Central America
[00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.340]   that is interesting to you?
[00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:03.820]   You mentioned Bogota.
[00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.960]   I went to Medellin and I have to admit,
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.340]   I didn't feel safe there.
[00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.460]   I felt, we heard a couple stories where there was one day,
[00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.700]   I just wanted to go take a nap in the park.
[00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.240]   And someone was like, you're not gonna take a nap
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.080]   in the park.
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.180]   That's not a thing that we do here.
[00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.380]   And the idea to not have your cell phone out
[00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:23.500]   and things like that,
[00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.100]   it became enough where I was just kind of spooked eventually
[00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.940]   and we bounced.
[00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.540]   But I heard so many great things about Medellin.
[00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.740]   I'm curious what your Bogota experience was
[00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.420]   or if there's anywhere else in Central or South America.
[00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:36.820]   - Yeah, I mean, if I were recommending to other people,
[00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:41.420]   I could go on for a great list of definitely Mexico City,
[00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:43.980]   awesome weekend trip from the US.
[00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.500]   You just wanna sit on the beach and relax.
[00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.340]   Cabo's a great trip from the US.
[00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:49.780]   Bogota was a great trip.
[00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:50.820]   - Oh, what's up with Oaxaca?
[00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.140]   Have you been to Oaxaca?
[00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.980]   - I have not, but I've heard cool things.
[00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:55.820]   I haven't been.
[00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.620]   So I think one place I'd go for the long weekend,
[00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:59.740]   I'd go to Costa Rica.
[00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:03.620]   I went once before my wife and I,
[00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.340]   like, I think we'd even met.
[00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:06.720]   And it was awesome.
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.700]   And she's never been, she's wanted to go.
[00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.660]   And now it's been 10 plus years.
[00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:11.980]   A lot of what we'd wanna do,
[00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:13.660]   we looked at doing with kids and we were like,
[00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:17.500]   gosh, it's just not the right place to go right now.
[00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:18.700]   Like, I wanna go surfing.
[00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.140]   We wanna go like hiking in the rainforest.
[00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:22.620]   And like, they're just not the most
[00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.080]   toddler-friendly activities.
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.900]   So to finally answer your question,
[00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.660]   if we got thrown on a plane right now, this weekend,
[00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.460]   I'd say let's go to Costa Rica.
[00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.140]   It's not the most inconvenient from the West Coast,
[00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:37.900]   way easier from LA because there's direct flights.
[00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.100]   That's probably where we'd go.
[00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:44.340]   - All the hacks, listen or meet up in Costa Rica.
[00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:45.980]   Get ready. - With a cocktail party.
[00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.340]   - With a cocktail party, with the name tags.
