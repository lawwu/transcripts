[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.300]   - So we talked a lot about meetings,
[00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.740]   in-person, conversation, verbal.
[00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.480]   Does a lot of this also apply to written communication,
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.960]   whether that's, you know, emails or text messages?
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.620]   - Yes, so why don't we talk about
[00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.140]   the four different aspects of the book?
[00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.860]   Obviously, if we're in-person, we can use all four, right?
[00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.820]   We can use imagery, the colors we're wearing.
[00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.020]   We can use vocal, non-verbal, and verbal.
[00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.940]   In email, we're just limiting the amount
[00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.820]   of communication modes that we can use
[00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.140]   to pretty much just verbal and a little bit of imagery.
[00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.800]   I mention imagery 'cause I think it's also a forgotten one,
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.340]   is even fonts have personality.
[00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.540]   There are researchers, real researchers,
[00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.840]   who have looked at the personality of fonts.
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.740]   For example, Chris, you wanna do a little game?
[00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.420]   - Yeah, I love games.
[00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.260]   - What do you think is the least funny font,
[00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.500]   according to the research?
[00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.800]   Least funny font.
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.000]   - I'm gonna go with Times New Roman.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.280]   - Okay, that was my guess as well.
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.500]   Nope, it is ironically Comic Sans.
[00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.440]   Comic Sans, called Comic Least Funny Font.
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.680]   They found that when people write things in Comic Sans,
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.720]   people do not find it funny, even if the joke's funny.
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.640]   So even our font can come across in our emails,
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.000]   including colors, including images
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.560]   that we might be using in our, like,
[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.920]   either graphics or icons.
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.360]   So sometimes in email, we can have imagery, too,
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.960]   not as much as in person or on a Zoom background.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.760]   Like, I'm very purposeful about the props
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.500]   I use behind me in my videos,
[00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.100]   but you can have some of those in emails.
[00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.880]   In emails, you have to be cuing people constantly, right?
[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.760]   An email is so few, it's only one mode of communication,
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.840]   so you have to be really purposeful with it.
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.160]   You wanna make sure, and this is not just
[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.620]   about making your emails longer.
[00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.000]   The biggest mistake that people make
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.840]   is they try to be charismatic by adding.
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.900]   And I don't think that being verbally charismatic
[00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.120]   is additive, it's about being purposeful.
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.880]   So it's using words that trigger something.
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.240]   I think a lot of our verbal communication
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.240]   has become sterilized, right?
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.280]   So we send emails that are like,
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.320]   "Hi, I'm following up the proposal.
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.940]   "I'll send it to you next week.
[00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.160]   "Thanks for the meeting, bye," right?
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.000]   Like, super, super sterile.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.700]   Can you swap out even a couple of words
[00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.820]   with something that are gonna change people's perception?
[00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.080]   And the way that they tested this,
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.440]   the reason I know that even just a couple
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.200]   of verbal cues matter, this isn't additive,
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.240]   it's just being purposeful, is what the researchers did
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.940]   is they had people come into their lab
[00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.360]   and they split them up into two different groups.
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.060]   The first group got a set of basic directions
[00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.760]   and they had to complete some tasks,
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.720]   like math problems and some basic intelligence tasks.
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.320]   The second group had the exact same quiz,
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.360]   the exact same questions, but in their directions,
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.120]   they swapped out three or four words
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.040]   with achievement-oriented words.
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.960]   So achievement-oriented words are words
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.160]   like win, succeed, master, achieve, right?
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.040]   Those are achievement-oriented words.
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.040]   They just sprinkled them in, just a couple swaps,
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.640]   three or four of these words.
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:05.900]   They found that the group
[00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.000]   that read the achievement-oriented words
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.720]   did better on the task, which is insane.
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.700]   If three or four words can make people do better
[00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.560]   on an intelligence test.
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.920]   They worked harder and longer on the problem set
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.680]   and they had more motivation.
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.280]   So they actually enjoyed that problem set more.
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.400]   The reason I share this is because
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.680]   if three or four words swapped out in a subject
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.680]   or your profile, like your LinkedIn profile
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.360]   or your calendar agenda,
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.940]   or the slides behind you in a presentation,
[00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.840]   if that can make your folks,
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.520]   your listeners feel more motivated,
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.500]   wouldn't we want to give them that gift?
[00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.760]   Like what a gift that we can give to the world
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.320]   with our charisma actually makes them more charismatic.
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.040]   - So what I'm hearing is that
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.920]   you can actually have a charismatic email
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.640]   if you have the right balance of words.
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:00.640]   Is it the same thing?
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.200]   Add a little warmth, add a little competence to an email?
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.440]   - Exactly, so here's the hack.
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.560]   In your subjects, your greeting and your sign-off,
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.600]   I want you to match the words with your charisma goals.
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.220]   If you want to be warm, use warm words, right?
[00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.400]   Hi partner, good morning team.
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.660]   So happy to see you all, best, right?
[00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.080]   Signing off best, best is a very warm word.
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.320]   If you want to be competent,
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.520]   use competent words in your opener and your sign-off.
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.000]   Onwards, you know, let's do this.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.620]   Can't wait to work together.
[00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.880]   You know, like those are competent openers and words.
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.760]   So yes, you can match your charisma goals in your emails.
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.320]   - And if you want to kind of come off more charismatic,
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.700]   as you say, is the goal to balance what's natural for you
[00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:47.540]   with those words?
[00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.560]   So if you kind of, at the beginning of this conversation,
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.340]   you reflected and said, wow,
[00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.620]   I'm probably more the competent person,
[00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.300]   let's add a little warmth.
[00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.540]   Or is the goal to put both of them out there
[00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.080]   to kind of have a balance in the email?
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.240]   - Okay, so this is where we get into the advanced,
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.280]   the advanced tips.
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.020]   So level one, balance.
[00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.280]   So if this is all new to you,
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.920]   I want as balanced as possible.
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:13.960]   So a little bit of warm words,
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.080]   a little bit of competent words.
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.620]   Same thing, a really easy hack that we can use here
[00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.480]   is like on your LinkedIn profile, look at your headline.
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.820]   Look at the first two sentences of your LinkedIn profile.
[00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.500]   Count the number of warm words versus competent words.
[00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:28.920]   Now this is more art than science.
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.460]   So we'll get a little bit more creative here,
[00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.300]   but warm words, when I say warm words,
[00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.500]   I mean warm words kind of make you feel the warm and fuzzies.
[00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.100]   Worms like words like collaborate, team, best,
[00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.500]   both, together, happy, great.
[00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:42.500]   Those are warm words.
[00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.320]   They have more warmth in them.
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.380]   Competent words are words like efficient,
[00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.220]   streamline, chart, data, science, right?
[00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:50.800]   Those are all more competent words.
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.380]   So a little art, not necessarily science.
[00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:53.820]   Actually, I have a glossary in the book
[00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.500]   if you want a more specific list.
[00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:57.700]   I want you to look at your LinkedIn profile
[00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.980]   and a way to count how many warm words,
[00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:01.840]   how many competent words you're using.
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.740]   And level one goal is to make it a mix.
[00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.180]   So try to have an equal amount of warm words
[00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:08.220]   and competent words.
[00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.460]   So even when I was writing the book,
[00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.660]   I tried to have a balance of warm and competent words
[00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.480]   on the pages that mattered, right?
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.860]   So in the introduction, in the description behind the book,
[00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:20.000]   in the description on Amazon,
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.980]   'cause I know that I wanna hit both warm readers
[00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:23.880]   and competent readers.
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.520]   I try to have a balance of both
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.940]   in any and all public-facing things,
[00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:30.560]   including like my slides.
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.920]   So I give a lot of keynotes.
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:34.920]   I have an exact equal balance of warm slides
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.080]   and competent slides.
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.400]   My competent slides are graphs and data and research.
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.960]   And for every single competent slide, I have a warm slide,
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.820]   a personal story, a funny gif, a joke, right?
[00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:45.980]   So those balance out.
[00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:47.560]   So I try to have that balance.
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:51.500]   Level two, and this is for my advanced learners,
[00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:55.160]   is if you are with a VIP, if you're with a boss
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.940]   or an important client or important customer,
[00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:02.820]   and you really want to respect them charismatically,
[00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:07.280]   you can dial up into their warmth or their competence.
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.800]   So for example, I have some VIPs in my life
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.800]   that are super high in competence.
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:13.880]   And so to respect and honor them,
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:17.880]   when I am engaging with them, I also dial up my competence.
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:21.880]   I still use warmth, but I just sort of edge more
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:24.400]   into the kind of words and nonverbal that they use
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.160]   to honor and respect where they're at.
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.000]   So that's kind of level two.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.920]   That's the ninja level.
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:32.520]   - I actually, I have a practical application
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:34.000]   that I'm now gonna apply this.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.120]   I'm probably more of a warmth writer
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.600]   with an exclamation point at every end of thing,
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:43.560]   always signing off best, smiley faces and everything.
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:46.080]   But my takeaway is I'm gonna go read
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:49.480]   like the LinkedIn profile or the bio on the website
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:51.560]   and try to figure out, okay, is this person
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:53.240]   that I'm about to email who I don't know?
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.760]   It's really easy if it's your boss.
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.640]   You know, is your boss the person that hugs you
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:58.560]   when you come in the room that's super, you know,
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.740]   always talking about life or are they very, you know,
[00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:02.640]   matter of fact, competent.
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:06.840]   But I imagine I could go read the tweets, the blog posts,
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:10.120]   the LinkedIn profile, identify who this person is
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.060]   and they probably are gonna be less excited
[00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:14.400]   about an email filled with exclamation points
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.320]   and smiley faces if their entire writing
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.360]   on the internet is very, you know,
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:22.680]   charts, percents, data, science.
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:25.560]   - Exactly, so like watching their YouTube video,
[00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:27.800]   watching their TED talk, looking at their profiles,
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:31.000]   matching them as a much, it's a way of literally saying,
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.800]   I wanna be on your page.
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:35.440]   Like I respect you so much that I wanna use your language.
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:36.720]   You also made a very good point.
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:41.720]   So exclamation points, emojis, and words like yay, fab,
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:46.160]   whoop, those are all warm, so they count as one warm point.
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.480]   In fact, every exclamation point I count as one warm point.
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:49.920]   So if you have three exclamation points,
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:52.160]   that's three warm words.
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:57.160]   And for my data heads, charts, percent, numbers, or data,
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:59.640]   those count as one competent word.
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.760]   So just consider that when you're doing your little audit
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:03.600]   on your profiles. - Yeah, you can just
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.440]   score an email, plus one, minus one,
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:06.280]   and see where you end up.
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.640]   - And so I love people to do a little audit
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.600]   where I ask them, and you can do this after this call,
[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:14.760]   is print out your last five important emails
[00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:15.600]   that you sent out.
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:16.960]   Whatever five important emails you sent out,
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:20.840]   print 'em out, yellow for warm, blue for competent,
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:22.240]   and count 'em, right?
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:23.640]   Like how are you coming across?
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.320]   If you have a mostly yellow email,
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.720]   you are coming across as too highly warm, right?
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:29.280]   If you have a mostly blue email,
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.100]   you are overwhelming them in competence.
[00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:35.560]   And remember, the research shows competence without warmth
[00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:37.840]   leaves people feeling suspicious.
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:38.920]   That is literally what they found,
[00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:42.000]   that people who are super smart but don't have enough warmth
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.680]   they are less likely to believe your competence.
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:45.880]   So all blue is too much competence.
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:48.320]   And if you have none at all, so no yellow, no blue,
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.760]   it means you're under-signaling.
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:52.720]   - Okay, I'm gonna do that after this call.
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:55.300]   (upbeat music)
[00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:57.880]   (upbeat music)
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.460]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:03.040]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:05.640]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:08.220]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:10.800]   (upbeat music)
