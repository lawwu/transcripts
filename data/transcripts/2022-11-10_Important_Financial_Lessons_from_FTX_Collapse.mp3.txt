[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   - Welcome to Radical Personal Finance,
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   to live a rich and meaningful life now
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   while building a plan for financial freedom
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   in 10 years or less.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   My name is Joshua Sheets, I'm your host,
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   and today I want to talk about some useful
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   personal finance rules to protect yourself
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   from financial collapse.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   And in this case, when I use the term, I mean it.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   I'm not talking about a broad-scale collapse
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   of an entire economy or a country, et cetera,
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   but I'm talking about the collapse of an institution.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   And today's commentary is sparked by the ongoing collapse
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   of the large cryptocurrency exchange called FTX.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   I would imagine that most listeners of the show
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   are aware of what is happening,
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   and so I'll just give you a quick overview
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   of where we are right now,
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   because my comments aren't specific to FTX.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   Rather, I'm using this as an opportunity for us to learn
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   and for us to think about good practices
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   to protect ourselves in general
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   on a good defensive position.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   About 30 seconds on the background,
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   FTX is a huge cryptocurrency exchange.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   And how do you even summarize the situation?
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   It's a rapidly developing situation.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   As I record this particular podcast just now,
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   the founder and CEO of FTX is releasing new details on Twitter.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Basically, my summary is simply that FTX
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   is getting completely demolished
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   because of a number of unwise decisions,
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   and many, many customers, if not all of the customers,
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   at least on the international FTX company,
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   are positioned now to lose huge amounts,
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   if not all of the funds and assets that they had held
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   on the FTX exchange.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   What we are watching in real time
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   is the seemingly almost instantaneous collapse
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   of a huge institution,
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   and we are watching billions,
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   I believe I should use the word with a B,
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   a huge amount, hundreds and hundreds of millions,
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   billions of dollars, of US fiat dollars,
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   of value wiped out like that.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   And people are hurting.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   Many, many people are hurting.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   And it's a horrific situation.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   I need to record a separate show basically saying,
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   "Don't kill yourself over money,
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   and here's why you shouldn't.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   We'll deal with that on another time."
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   But right now, many, many people are hurting,
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   had their trading accounts wiped out,
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   their savings wiped out, etc.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   So that's what I want to say right now.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   If you're interested,
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   just go and read a little bit about the situation,
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   but it's absolutely catastrophic.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Here's what I want to emphasize.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   I want to emphasize what are the rules
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   and the things that you can do
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   from a personal finance perspective
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   to minimize the chance of your getting wiped out.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Now, a couple of these are obvious,
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   and they are related to cryptocurrency management in general.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   First, obviously, when you are investing in cryptocurrencies,
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   it makes a massive difference what you invest in,
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   or at least I think it makes a big difference
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   what you invest in.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   Some people don't see any functional difference
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   between Bitcoin and the FTX token
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   or Bitcoin and anything else that they lump them all in.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   I'm not so convinced of that myself.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   I think there is a fundamental difference,
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   and it has to do with the fundamental nature
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   of a decentralized algorithm like Bitcoin
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   versus some of the other approaches
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   that people are taking towards cryptocurrency.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   So I think it matters what you invest in.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   I myself am, I wouldn't call myself a Bitcoin maximalist,
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   but I think that it certainly has a better argument
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   than some of the other coins.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   And if you're getting involved in other coins,
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   you should know your market
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   and pay attention and follow your strategies.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   Number two, with all of your computer coins,
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   if you do not hold the keys, you do not own them.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   In the Bitcoin privacy course
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   that we have at bitcoinprivacycourse.com,
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   one of the first things we teach you
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   is how to hold your keys.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   And if you do not hold the keys to all of your computer coins,
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   you do not own them.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   Your computer coins that are held on an exchange
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   are not yours.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   They are held by the exchange.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   That's not to say there's not a use
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   for buying and selling and owning coins on an exchange,
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   but they are not yours.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   And the parallel analogy or metaphor,
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   or just comparison, not metaphor,
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   but comparison I would give for this,
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   has to do with ownership of something like gold and silver.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   You do not own gold or silver unless you control it,
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   unless you control the physical substance,
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   be it coins, necklaces, watches, or bricks of gold.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   You do not own it unless you physically control it.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   That's not to say that there's not a place
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   for paper gold and paper silver,
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   but buying shares in a gold or silver ETF
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   is not the same as owning physical gold coins
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   or physical silver coins or physical something.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   If you own the physical product,
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   then you can be certain of what's happening to it.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   You know who controls it.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   You know that if I have 100 ounces of silver
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   sitting in my safe,
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   that there are indeed 100 ounces of silver.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   And of course you would verify the authenticity of that,
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   have properly assayed assets,
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   but you know that 100 ounces of gold or silver
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   is sitting there.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   It's not lent out.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   It's not owned by someone else.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   It's not being multiplied.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   It is just sitting there.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   That comes with major advantages and some disadvantages.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   The fact that it is sitting there renders it useless.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   It's not being traded.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   It's not being loaned against.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   It's not making money.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   It's not making interest.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   It's just a lump of metal sitting there in your safe.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   But you know it is there.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   On the other hand, if you own shares in an ETF,
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   you don't actually know what is happening
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   with the gold and silver that you allegedly own.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   You have to trust the intermediary institution
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   to do its job.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   Now there are institutions of varying quality.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   At the most limited end, you can go to your buddy
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   and you can say to him,
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   "Hey, listen.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   Go ahead and buy 100 ounces of silver for me."
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   And your buddy can say,
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   "Okay, I got 100 ounces of your silver
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   sitting here in my safe."
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   And that may or may not be appropriate.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   Or you can go up to a very well-respected,
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   audited, publicly transparent company
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   and you can purchase shares.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   And they can say, "Look, here's where the gold is."
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   The point is if you don't own it or control it,
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   you don't actually have the asset.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   And it's the same with your computer coins.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   If you don't hold the keys to those coins,
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   you,
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   then you can't actually be confident
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   of what is happening with them.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   And so if you have money on the exchanges,
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   unless you are using that money actively
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   for some purpose,
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   do not hold the money there.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   And again, there are good reasons to hold money,
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   computer coins, on exchanges.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   Just like there are good reasons to trade ETFs
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   of gold and silver.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   If you want to speculate on something like gold or silver,
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   then you speculate on the directional price
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   much more inexpensively
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   and with much less friction
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   than using an ETF than you do
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   with trying to buy and sell gold and silver coins.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   Physical gold and silver coins
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   are horrible for speculation
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   because the friction of buying them and selling them
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   and all the costs involved
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   makes it so that it's very hard
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   to eke out a profit in that scenario.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   So trading paper gold and paper silver
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   is the way to trade the markets
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   in a much more low-cost way
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   than owning the stuff.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   And so I think that's an appropriate way
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   to think about your computer coins.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   The coins that you own
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   must not ever be on an exchange.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   You must hold the keys
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   and that way you can be confident that you own them.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   But if you're dealing with a trading scenario,
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   then it may in many cases be simpler
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   for you to use an exchange.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   So that's why lesson 101
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   that we teach at BitcoinPrivacyCourse.com
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   is make sure that you hold the keys
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   and here's how you do it.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   It's not difficult to do.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   It just requires you to actually
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   take the steps to do it.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   Now let's move out of specific
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   cryptocurrency-related commentary
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   and let's talk about good, sound,
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   fundamental financial planning.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   I'm going to give you a few rules.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   I haven't talked much about these publicly.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   I've shared these with private clients along the way,
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   but I think that these are useful rules.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   When you're involved,
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   first, anytime you get involved in an investment,
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   it's important that you understand
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   what your goals are for that investment
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   in order to make an intelligent choice
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   with how to be involved in it.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   And this is something where
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   we repeat these fundamentals
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   over and over and over again,
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   and yet it's so easy for us to get caught up
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   in the emotions of the moment.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   And I don't know what the percentage of investors
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   who get involved emotionally is,
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   but it sure seems like the percentage of investors
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   who get involved emotionally is very, very high
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   compared to the percentage of investors
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   who get involved based upon a strategic plan.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   The only thing that makes an investment
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   right or wrong for you
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   has to do with whether or not
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   that investment can meet your goals.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   So in order for you to know
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   if an investment is right for you,
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   you need to begin with
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   what are your investment goals.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   And if you are clear on your investment goals,
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   then you can go to your chosen investment
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   or your prospective investment
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   and you can identify whether
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   this is an appropriate investment for you or not.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   If you need big wins,
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   then you're going to focus on speculative,
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   very risky investments.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   If you don't need big wins,
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   there's no reason to go for risk.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   And you need to carefully assess
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   what you actually need for you to win.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   This will relate to your cash flow,
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   the amount of money that you have coming in,
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   your expenses,
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   how much excess money you have.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   This will relate to your position in life, etc.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   There are a number of good rules of thumb
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   that I think are very well worth considering.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   Some of the most commonly discussed rules
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   I don't know how to apply.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   For example, Warren Buffett famously,
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   rule number one of investing,
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   don't lose money.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   Rule number two is,
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   if you do lose money,
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   see rule number one
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   or whatever his various syntax is.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   The point is,
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   I don't know how to say don't lose money.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   I think that's more of a useful heuristic
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   for you to keep in mind to say,
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   I'm going to make sure,
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   I'm going to try very hard
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   to make sure I understand enough
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   to not lose money.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   But when you actually say to somebody,
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   don't lose money,
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   that's hard to put into play.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   On the other hand,
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   there is a very useful rule of
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   don't invest any money
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   that you can't afford to lose.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   And I think that's a very useful one.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   It has its own difficulty of application
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   because how much can you afford to lose?
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   I don't want to lose any of it.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   So you're back to kind of the rule
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   of don't lose money.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   But it is important for you to recognize
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   how much of this can I not afford to lose?
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   What if I did lose it all?
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   What would happen to me
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   and to my financial situation?
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   Now, in order for you to assess this,
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   you need to ask yourself,
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   what would I do if I lost it all?
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   This is why people's risk profile changes,
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   especially as they age.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   I have been one who has
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   lodged my share of criticism
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   at the idea that older people
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   should just automatically become
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   more conservative investors
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   as they grow older.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   And I've been vocal in that.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   I don't think that older investors
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   should just automatically put everything
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   into treasuries
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   because they don't have any time.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   But there is a real truth to the fact
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   that older investors
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   have a much harder time
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   if they lose money
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   than a younger investor does.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   So, let's do two scenarios.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   If you are 25 years old
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   and you're working a job
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   earning $75,000 a year
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   and your annual expenses
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   are $35,000 a year
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   and you're saving all the rest of the money
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   and you're investing it aggressively
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   into computer coins
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   and you find yourself in a situation
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   where you wind up
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   losing all of your money
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   and you are completely wiped out,
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   you're not going to,
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   other than the emotional risk
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   of you losing all your money
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   and having to deal with that psychology,
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   you're not going to,
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   you're not dead.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   You still have a job,
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   you're still young,
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   you still have plenty of income,
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   you can recover from that situation.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   On the other hand,
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   if you're 85 years old
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   and you have $35,000 a year of expenses
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   and you have $20,000 a year
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   of Social Security income
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   and you have a $300,000 portfolio
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   and you lose all of your $300,000
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   in a bad investment,
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   it's very, very difficult
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   for you to know how to survive.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   You're left with nothing.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   You're unemployable in that situation
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   and you're basically going to be depending
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   on the charity of others in that scenario.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   And so the risk,
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   the loss for someone who is older,
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   who is unemployed,
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   is a much higher risk
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   than for somebody who is younger
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   and has more time.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   And so always ask yourself,
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   what would I do
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   if I got wiped out on this investment?
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   And the secret to being able
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   to make more aggressive investments,
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   to take greater amounts of risk,
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   is to be more conservative
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   in your personal overview of life.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   What I mean is,
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   this is why having low expenses
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   is so helpful.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   If your expenses are very low,
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   then you can make it
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   even if your income falls apart.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   This is why it's useful to avoid debt,
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   because if your debt payments are very low,
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   you can make it
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   even if everything falls apart.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   This is why it's so exceedingly useful
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   to have cash savings,
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   to have money set aside
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   that is not in any way exposed to risk,
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   so that if the worst case scenario happens,
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   you have time and margin
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   for you to figure out your next move.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   This is why it's so useful to have income,
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   even if it's not strictly necessary
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   because it allows you the confidence
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   of knowing I can still support myself,
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   my family, etc.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   And so you want to make sure that,
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   especially if you're going
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   for aggressive, high-risk investments,
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   you want to make sure
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   that your fundamentals are in excellent shape
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   and that you have secured your foundation
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   in a very strong way.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   That allows you to be more comfortable
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   with taking larger risks.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   How much money should you invest?
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   This one is a hard question to answer.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   There are some useful rules of thumb
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   that I think are well worth considering,
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   but most of them don't apply to people
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   who are just starting out.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   So, for example,
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   one rule of thumb that I appreciate,
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   that I think has a lot of wisdom,
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   is don't ever put more than 10% of your net worth
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   into any particular venture.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   Is it a perfect rule?
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   No, and I'll explain why not in a moment,
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   but it's a very useful rule.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   Let's use an example.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   It's my understanding,
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   by the public news reports
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   and previous partnerships and whatnot,
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   that the NFL football star Tom Brady
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   had allied himself with the FTX Exchange
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   and had invested into the company
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   and had taken some of his compensation,
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   perhaps in the form of ownership of some kind,
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   in the company,
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   was partnering with the company.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   Let's assume that FTX has a value of zero
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   and he loses all of his investments.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   There was a headline floating around Twitter yesterday
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   indicating how,
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   "Wow, Tom Brady is broke."
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   Guarantee you Tom Brady is not broke.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   But imagine you're in a situation
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   of a guy like Tom Brady.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   You're close to the end
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   of your actively earned income career.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   Obviously, his brand still has massive amounts of equity.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   He'll make plenty of money in the years to come.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   But you're in the twilight of your earned income
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   from practicing your primary sport,
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   in his case, obviously, football.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   Imagine yourself if he really did have,
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   say, 70% of his wealth tied up
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   in one particular business that went bust.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   Imagine how devastating that would be to him.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   Now, imagine that he had no more than 10%
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   of his income tied up in any one particular venture.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   A 10% loss?
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   You can stomach that.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   You can continue forward.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   It doesn't wipe you out.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   It hurts, obviously, to lose 10% of your net worth,
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   but it doesn't wipe you out.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   Now, in his case, obviously,
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   we don't know how much of his net worth,
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   but I would imagine it's far less than 10%,
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   but I'm just speculating, just like anyone else is.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   The point is simply use a public name,
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   use a current example of an absolute wipeout of a company
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   almost overnight,
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   and imagine that happening in your investments,
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   in your portfolio.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   Try to minimize your exposure to any one particular thing
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   to 10% or less.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   Now, I said this is an imperfect scenario.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   The reason I said it's an imperfect scenario
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   is that most of us can't start with this rule.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   So if we use a stereotypical example of a young person
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   graduated from college, gets a job,
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   that young person can be wiped out
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   because 100% of their money is coming from one single job.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   You can't start by saying,
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   "I'm not going to put more than 10% of my money
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   "into any one thing,"
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   and there are always levels of risk, right?
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   That young person who has saved $100,000
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   working in the United States has risk
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   because $100,000 of their money is all in U.S. dollars.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   What if U.S. dollars decline in value?
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   It's funny.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   When you think about the collapse of FTX,
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   it just makes me think of bank collapses over the years.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   In our modern era,
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   we feel very, very insulated from bank collapses
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   because, especially for those of us
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   who live in the United States, Great Britain, Canada, etc.,
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   we just feel very, very insulated from these things.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   Our banks are highly regulated.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   We feel a significant degree of confidence in our currency.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   We believe it feels fairly bulletproof.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   But at its core, recognize that throughout history,
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   banks have continually collapsed.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   That's why we have the whole concept of a bank run.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   It's immortalized throughout history.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   You go back to the history of any country,
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   you'll find constant series of financial crises
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   and bank runs and bank collapses
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   and bankruptcies, etc., across the board.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   That's a very normal thing.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   And at its core,
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   while we have a much more robust system in the modern day
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   with government insurance,
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   the backing of the Federal Reserve, etc.,
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   I don't think that this fundamentally
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   makes banking or currencies stronger.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   What it does is it increases the public confidence
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   and all of banking lives or dies based upon confidence.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   It's all a con game.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   It's all a confidence game.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   That if people believe in the strength and power of the US dollar,
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   then the US dollar has strength and power.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   If people stop believing in the power and the strength of the US dollar,
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   the US dollar loses its power and strength.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   And so it's all a con game, all of it.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   I was explaining recently to my 9-year-old how banking works
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   and it blew his mind,
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   the concept of fractional reserve banking.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   It's like, yeah, you take your money to the bank,
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   put it in there, they lend it out.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   It's like, but you can't get it out?
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   And it was funny trying to explain to an elementary student
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   how modern banking works.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   And the point is like, but then everybody can't get their money.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   And I explained, yeah, it's all a confidence game.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   People are confident in the bank, everything is going, it's good.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   And so what you see in the collapse of an institution like FTX
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   is you see what has happened so many times in the world of banking
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   the way that we understand it today.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   Now, because of the many decades of history and the many bank failures, etc.,
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   we've developed these new forms of insurance,
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   these new things to basically shore up the value and confidence in the banks.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   But go back and read a couple of the books on the 2008 banking crisis
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   in the United States, the Lehman Brothers bailout, etc.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   And what you will discover is that the private conversations
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   that the Federal Reserve personnel were having
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   and the politicians and the president and whatnot,
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   basically they were scared of exactly what happened to FTX
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   happening across the entire institution,
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   all of the institutions in the United States.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   A fundamental collapse, a fundamental instantaneous collapse.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   And the bankers had gotten so far out over the tips of their skis
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   with their lending practices that if the Federal Reserve had not stepped in
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   and basically bolstered the entire system and put in liquidity,
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   then it probably would have happened.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   Now, you can choose your argument as to what's happened since then,
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   but I'll skip that.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   The point is it was this close in your and my lifetime
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   of the entire financial system unraveling.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   I don't think it's unhealthy, by the way.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   I think that collapse is healthy because it gets rid of the dead weight.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   And depending on your perspective, I find the arguments that
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   because the US government didn't allow the dead weight to disappear,
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   didn't allow the natural bankruptcy process to take its course,
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   that there's good reason to think that things are not better,
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   but time will tell.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   My argument is simply that don't look at FTX and poke your fingers and say,
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   "Ha ha, those stupid people who invested in cryptocurrency,
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   I'm so much smarter over here."
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   Don't think that it can't happen here.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   The risks, the systemic risks on a global basis are not better.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   They're different, but they're not better.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   And we really were this close to having that kind of event happen in 2008, 2009.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   And there's no fundamental reason why it can't, won't,
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   or shouldn't happen in the future.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   It all depends on public confidence.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   It's a con game, all of it.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   So there's no other choice other than to play the con game.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   There's no really reasonable alternative.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   You can argue, "Okay, Bitcoin," but even that, obviously,
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   nothing's for sure.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   So we need to develop new systems,
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   and banking has had a significant ongoing evolutionary process.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   The best situation that we have--
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   the situation we have today is a result of hundreds of years of history,
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   of thousands and thousands of bank runs and bank failures and bankruptcies
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   and collapses of currencies, reissuing of currencies.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   The U.S. dollar has been reissued multiple times,
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   has collapsed three or four key times.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   The U.S. national banks in the short couple hundred-year history
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   of the United States has collapsed a couple of times
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   and has been reinstituted and put in place again,
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   and we're just living through the current wave of it.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   But financial contagion, financial panic, financial collapse
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   will happen again.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   It always does.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   But every time we look at it, we try to come up with a new and better system
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   and make it stronger and more robust.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   Back to the 10%.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   In the beginning of life, you can't really apply these rules.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   You're 100% committed to the salary from one company,
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   and you get fired, and there goes 100% of your income.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   It's hugely risky, and yet there's really few other solutions in the beginning.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   But as your wealth grows, as your business grows,
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   then you can start to spread out your risk,
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   and you can say, "I'm not going to have any one particular job
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   "or any one particular client responsible for more than 10% of my income,"
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   and you can build a more robust portfolio.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   In the beginning of your life, let's say you have $10,000 saved.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   You might have $1,000 of physical currency and $9,000 in the bank,
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   but it's all going to be in one institution.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   There's no benefit of you taking $10,000 and spreading it across 10 institutions.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   It's too unwieldy, too expensive.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   It doesn't make sense.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   So you can't apply that in the beginning.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   But fast forward, if you find yourself having $500,000 in savings,
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   then having all of that in one bank is unwise,
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   and so you want to spread it out and diversify it.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   You probably still can't follow a 10% rule.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   Having 10 different accounts with $50,000 in them is too many accounts.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   It's too unwieldy. It's too difficult to manage.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   But your money certainly should not all be in one account.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   The reason, even if you're not worried about a bank collapse,
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   you say, "Well, I have a bank that's covered by FDIC insurance,
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   and it's a very stable banking country, etc."
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   Yeah, but banks have problems,
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   and sometimes your money gets shut off for a few days.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   Or the regulators come in, and they show up,
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   and they put the bank into receivership,
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   and it takes them a few days before they get things going again.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   Or things simply as mundane as you get flagged
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   because you're trying to make an international debit card transaction,
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   and now your bank shuts down your debit card
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   and forces you to come back to the country and walk into a bank office
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   in order to prove your identity.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   So this is why you have to have multiple banks, multiple debit cards, etc.,
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   and keep that infrastructure going.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   But again, you probably can't do 10, 10, 10, 10 on those scenarios.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   And so the 10% rule is not a perfect rule,
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   but it's a valuable reminder to say
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   that don't invest to a point of wiping you out.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   The next concept I want to convey to you is simply the concept of ratcheting.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   My example here is I think about the old show of "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   And the great thing about that show was it had these ratchet points.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   I think it was $1,000 and $64,000 and $1 million, something like that.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   But you knew at various points that if you were playing and you lost,
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   you wouldn't go below the number that you were ratcheted up to.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   In life, I think there are a number of these ratchet points
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   that are worth paying attention to and considering.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   I don't know exactly what they are.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   I can't identify the specific number.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   But I would encourage you to think about your own life.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   What amount of money do you never want to go below no matter what?
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   In the past, I did a show on $1,000, $10,000, $100,000.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   That was primarily dedicated to people who were saving.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   And the point was that if you're poor and you can get $1,000 scraped together,
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   you're no longer poor because now you have enough wiggle room
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   to handle most of the expenses of life.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   You're not dependent on payday loans.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   You're not dependent on running around scraping, etc.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   With $10,000, which is an accessible savings target
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   for just about anybody in a year or so, at really any level,
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   you can pretty much free yourself from most of the needs.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   You can be your own bank for most things.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   You don't need to rely on credit.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   You can make first, last, and security on an apartment.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   You can go get a new job.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   You can handle two months out of income, etc.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   Then my argument on $100,000 was that if you save $100,000 in the beginning of life,
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   that you're positioned to where all of your decisions that you want to make
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   are open to you.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   Again, you can move across the country.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   You can move across the world.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   You can start almost any business.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   You can do all these things with having that amount of money.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   You're not addicted to the month-to-month living of paycheck-to-paycheck
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   that keeps people stuck in a job.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   But none of those things make you wealthy.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   When you get too wealthy, then things start to change.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   I think that basically the next ratchet up between $100,000
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   is basically kind of a modest--
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   it's almost like an initial level of financial independence.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   If you think of somebody who has--let's use the 4% rule.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   You think of somebody who has $1 million in the bank
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   and can withdraw $40,000 a year of income.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   That's not a high-level lifestyle, but you can live on $40,000 a year.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   In most places of the world, you can have an apartment that is safe
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   and that is comfortable and that is not rat-infested and roach-infested.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   You can feed yourself high-quality food.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   You can cover your basic living expenses.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   You can live in most cities of the world,
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   or at least all states and countries of the world, on $40,000.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   Maybe not in Luxembourg or Liechtenstein or Switzerland or Singapore,
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   but you can live in many, many places on that.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   But it's not a great lifestyle.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   So you think about what your great lifestyle is.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   Maybe it's $3 million where you have $10,000 a month of income
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   using a 4% rule.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   That's a very strong middle-class lifestyle in most of the world.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   So maybe you would just say, "I would never want to go below $3 million."
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   My point in using these numbers is at $500,000,
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   the difference between $100,000 saved and $2 million saved
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   is massive in terms of a ratcheting effect.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   You can't live on the income from $500,000.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   $500,000 is just a bigger emergency fund, basically.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   It's not financial independence yet.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   But you can live on the income from $2 million.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   You're not living big time, but you're living comfortably,
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   fine enough with plenty of time.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   So maybe your ratchet number is $100,000 and $2 million.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   Then after $2 million, the question is, "All right, what's the next ratchet number?"
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   There's not a huge difference in lifestyle between $2 million and $3 million,
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   but there is a huge difference in lifestyle between $2 million and $10 million.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   So maybe your ratchet number is then the next one is $10 million.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   These numbers are all personalized.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   What I encourage you to do to figure out your numbers is to choose an arbitrary number
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   and then say, "If I had this amount of money saved, what would this allow me to do?
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   What could I do? How could I live? How would I spend the income from this?"
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   and clarify it in terms of a lifestyle.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   I've watched over the years many people who had, say, $3 million saved,
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   a number that for their lifestyle would have been perfectly adequate
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   to secure their financial freedom,
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   and yet they just had this idea that, "I have to go, I have to go, I have to go."
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   So they would risk the $3 million, and by risk here I'm thinking especially of bringing in leverage,
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   too much leverage, too much risk, and they wind up shooting for $10,000,
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   and they wind up dropping back to $200,000 or $500,000 or something like that,
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   and now they're in a mess, and they've lost that initial stability of financial independence.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   I don't care what your numbers are, but think carefully about them.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   And as you reach a ratchet point, ask yourself,
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   "Can I ensure that I don't go below this number again?
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   Can I pull the risk off the table and then go for the next ratchet point
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   in some way that's going to ensure that I never go below this current number?
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   And how can I ensure and protect this current number?"
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   There are many people who have been become--
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   had hundreds of millions of dollars who then took another roll of the dice
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   and went in something where they faced government regulation,
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   they faced fraud accusations, they faced lawsuits, etc.,
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   and if those people didn't have something set aside in an insurance fund,
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   then being totally wiped out is not fun.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   But if you have something set aside in an insurance fund,
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   then you can be very well protected.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   Let's talk about insurance funds.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   The way that you insure your assets, again, is very personalized.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   At one level it might just be saying, "You know what?
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   I'm going to make sure that I take $10,000 of cash out of the bank
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   so that I always have money and I'm going to put it in my buddy's gun safe
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   where I know I can get at it."
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   At another level, your insurance fund might be saying,
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   "I'm going to pay off my house.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   And because my house has-- I live in Florida or Texas
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   and my house is completely exempt from the claims of creditors,
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   I've got homestead protection on my house,
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   I'm going to make sure that I just pay off my house
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   even though I could leverage it and go more,
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   and that way I'll always be able to sell a piece of real estate
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   and I'll always have the money in this house."
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   Or, "I'm going to make sure that I fully fund my IRA or my 401(k) every year
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   because that money in my 401(k) is protected from the claims of my creditors
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   and I'm going to invest that money into traditional mutual funds
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   that are going to do fine.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   I'm just never going to play with that.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   I'm not going to do some crazy strategy in my 401(k).
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   This is my insurance fund."
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   At another level, it may be, "I'm going to take $5 million out of my portfolio.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   I'm going to put this $5 million into a trust that is there
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   to make sure that it's out of my estate, it's transferred out,
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   it's going to be away and it's going to be protected from the claims of creditors.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   And my family members and I, we may not be able to live great on the $5 million,
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   but by moving it offshore, moving it into an asset protection trust, etc.,
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   at least if we lose everything, we'll still have that money.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   And then I'm going to go over here and I'm going to roll my dice
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   on the other projects that I have going on."
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   If you imagine yourself as Sam What's-His-Name, the founder of FTX,
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   and here you are and one day you're a multi-billionaire
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   and then a week later there's a good chance that not only do you have no money,
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   but you wind up in a situation where you're going to face massive lawsuits
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   and potentially have any personal assets that you have wiped out,
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   you see the point.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   Or imagine you're Alex Jones and one day you're doing well,
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   business is good, you've got millions of dollars flying in all over the place,
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   and then a few years later you're facing a billion dollars of court costs
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   and judgments against you.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   So think of yourself in these situations and recognize that none of these guys
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   imagined that this was going to happen.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   If you had talked to Alex Jones 10 years ago,
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   he would never have thought that the situation he's facing in would come to fruition.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   Or if you'd talked to the founder of FTX,
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   he would never have thought that he'd be in this situation.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   But all of a sudden you're there.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   And so this is why in point four of the radical personal finance framework for wealth,
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   we talk about avoid catastrophe.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   Is that you need to regularly--
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   Remember number one is increase income, two, decrease expenses,
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   three, invest wisely, four is avoid catastrophe,
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   and five is optimize lifestyle.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   When you're avoiding catastrophe, you take off your rose-colored glasses
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   and you put on your disaster glasses and you say,
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   "What are all the bad things that could happen to me?"
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   And you do that and you say, "I should have an emergency fund,"
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   or "There might be a global famine and I should have three months of food in the house,"
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   or "I might get sued and all of a sudden I had $20 million
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   but now I'm wiped out and I've got a billion-dollar lawsuit against me,"
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   or "I wind up owing a creditor hundreds of millions of dollars."
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   And you have to do this on a regular consistent basis
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   and then put in place the solutions way ahead of time
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   for more than what you need.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   I've talked about asset protection planning.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   And the secret with asset protection planning,
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   the rule is once an event happens that gives rise to claims against you,
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   it is too late.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   All of the money moves that you make at that point in time
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   can be undone by the judge and basically even to the point of taking away your freedom,
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   your physical freedom, locking you in prison.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   But the stuff that happens long before that happens can be very well positioned.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   You put aside money for your five-year-old daughter, your five-year-old son,
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   and you set up a family trust that is going to benefit your five-year-old daughter,
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   your family son.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   Fast forward 20 years, your child gets married, then gets divorced.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   Well, the money that was in the trust can be positioned to be completely exempt
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   from the divorce claims, and your child can continue to be wealthy
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   regardless of what the judge says in the divorce case.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   But if you gave the money to your child at 20-something years old
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   and it was never in the trust, and then the divorce happens,
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   well, kiss off the money. It's gone.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   So you have to be proactive.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   You have to look at when disaster strikes other people
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   and then ask yourself, "What will I do if disaster strikes me?"
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   And I believe that this thinking is extremely valuable,
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   and it's deeply underrepresented.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   And so all of the little stuff matters.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   How many smoke detectors do you have in your house?
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   Have you checked the batteries? Do you have a ladder
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   so that your children can get out of the second-floor window
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   down to the first-floor window in case of a fire without breaking their legs?
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   Have you prepared in advance a family meeting spot?
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   If something happens, we meet here.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   All of the humdrum daily stuff is a big deal.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   Do you have the ability to flag down EMS when you have a heart attack?
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   Is your driveway clearly labeled so that if you call 911 when having a heart attack,
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   then you can get someone there quickly?
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   And at every level, as your wealth increases,
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   you have to think about more and more of these things,
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   and you want to bring them in.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   What are those things, the defibrillation machines?
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   An example would be that if somebody is completely broke,
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   then having--the name completely went to me--the things that you put on your heart,
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   those things save lives.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   That's why you see them in so many commercial locations.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   But when you get to a point with your wealth,
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   you should have one of those in your own home
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   so that if it comes down to you need one of those--
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   and again, I'm not medical enough to do it.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   I don't have one yet anyway.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   But it's the kind of thing where you look at it and say,
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   "Okay, I'm going to go ahead and get this because who knows,
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   it might pay off someday."
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   Same way I talk about bunkers,
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   like nuclear fallout bunkers and bomb bunkers, etc.
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   I think it's silly for somebody who is broke
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   to worry about setting up a nuclear radiation fallout shelter.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   The risk of needing a nuclear radiation fallout shelter
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   is so low that there's no point in somebody who is broke doing that.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   But if you're a multimillionaire
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   and you don't have some form of nuclear fallout shelter prepared,
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   then why are you not paying attention to these small things that could happen?
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   Or a better example would be a tornado shelter.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   I don't think it's dumb.
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   If you live in Tornado Alley,
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   obviously you go and invest in a tornado shelter.
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   But people just ignore it until the storm comes through.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   So when the tornadoes tear up the state next to you
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   or when the guys get blown up on the FTX exchange,
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   look at that and then go back to your own portfolio and say,
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   "What could wipe me out?"
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   And then think about what ratcheting points you don't want to go below.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   So if you're going to take a risk in some kind of aggressive investment,
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   how much should you invest into that?
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   This is one of those things that I'll give you the best answer
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   that I've come up with over the years.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   You want to invest enough of your money
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   so that if the investment hits,
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   it will make a substantial difference to your life.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   But you don't want to invest so much
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   so that if the investment gets wiped out,
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   that it destroys your whole life.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   And here's the point.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   Let's imagine you've got a net worth of $5 million.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   And you think to yourself, "You know what?
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   I'm going to go and I'm going to get involved.
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   There's this fancy new project that I want to get involved in
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   or I'm going to put my money in Bitcoin."
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   And you say, "What's the best opportunity?
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   I think this investment could 100x.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   So I'm going to take $5,000
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   and I'm going to invest $5,000 in this investment."
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   So you invest $5,000.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   And imagine your investment 100x,
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   which is, of course, horrifically difficult to do.
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   So you go from $5,000 to $500,000.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   Did that change your financial future in any meaningful way?
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   Well, if you've got a $5 million net worth,
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   it doesn't do anything for you.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   You don't do a thing differently.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   If you all of a sudden wake up
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   and now your balance sheet shows
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   that you've got $5,500,000 to your name
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   instead of $5 million,
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   you don't do anything differently.
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   You could go buy a car to celebrate,
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   but you could have bought a car anyway.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   It's just meaningless.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   So clearly, even if you had a 100x investment
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   on your $5,000,
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   clearly that wasn't enough money at risk
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   to make any kind of difference in your financial situation.
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   Now, let's play with another number.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   What if you invested $50,000?
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   You have a $5 million net worth, $50,000.
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   And let's assume this magical investment 100xs.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   Well, now all of a sudden you've got $5 million.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   And that does fundamentally change your overall lifestyle.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   To go from $5 million to $10 million
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   in a short period of time
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   with your magical investment that 100xed,
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   that changes it.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   It still doesn't change it massively.
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   You don't go all of a sudden to flying on private jets.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   So $50,000 is probably too little still.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   And so you run these numbers, right?
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   What if you put $150,000 into your 100x investment?
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   150,000 times 100 is 15 million.
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   Well, now you just fundamentally changed everything.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   To go from $5 million to $20 million in net worth
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   is a ratchet up point.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   At $5 million, you can live well.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   At $20 million, you quickly move into
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   a whole different style of living.
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   And there's a big lifestyle benefit to that.
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   So you run the numbers.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   And I used 100x, right?
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   Obviously, 100x is virtually impossible to achieve
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   in any reasonable investment.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   But let's say that you think it's 100x.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   You've got to invest enough to where the 100x return
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   is going to make a difference.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   What about the downside?
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   You've got $5 million and you lose $5,000?
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   Doesn't matter to you.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   Lose $50,000?
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   No one likes to lose $50,000.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   But remember, at $5 million of assets,
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   your net worth is going to be bouncing around
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   half a million dollars, a million dollars a year regardless,
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   just with normal investment market fluctuations.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   $150,000?
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   You're very much in the range of where it still
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   is not a big deal.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   To lose $150,000 is not a big deal.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   And so you play with these numbers and you say,
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   "What's the maximum upside I could ever engage in
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   and you choose a number that's going to allow you
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   to have enough of an impact to where it's going
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   to make a difference in your life?"
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   Now remember, most investments,
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   virtually all investments will never 100x.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   So maybe you say, "My big speculation is to 10x."
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   Man, if we could 10x investments,
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   that would be awesome.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   But now go back to those numbers.
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   You put $150,000 into an investment and it 10xs?
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   Well, that's $1.5 million, but now it just doesn't make that,
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   you know, $5 million to $6.5 million.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   I mean, you're richer, but it's not lifestyle changing.
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   And so on the other hand, if you lose $150,000,
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   it's not lifestyle changing as well.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   And so you play with your expected returns
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   and your expected losses and assume your investment
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   goes to zero and then try to figure out
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   where do you want to be?
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   Like, what do you do?
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   And that's the only way I know how to do it,
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   is choose a number where on the upside it makes enough sense
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   to where you're actually excited about taking the huge risk
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   with a speculative investment, and on the downside
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   where it doesn't wipe you out
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   and you can stomach the risk of losing it all.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   The numbers will be different depending on your income,
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   depending on your assets, depending on your other
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   investment portfolio, your insurance plans,
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   what your personal ratchet numbers are.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   But that's the thinking process,
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   the bracketing process that you go through
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   in order to arrive at the right number for you.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   Now what if you've made it?
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   What if you've been a big winner in a space
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   and you have a big investment that has actually won for you?
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   What do you do then?
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   I've been fortunate over the years to have quite a lot
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   of crypto millionaires in my audience,
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   and I've worked with a lot of them in private consulting.
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   And here's the advice that I have given.
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   And here's what's so astonishing about crypto millionaires
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   is that in many cases over the last decade,
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   their wins have come exceedingly quickly,
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   and yet they have come based upon market forces
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   that they can't control.
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   So there's a huge amount of insecurity and uncertainty
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   around this suddenly grown fortune
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   that is generally not there when people have a business.
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   If you build your wealth in a business,
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   then you can analyze it very differently
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   than if you've built your wealth in a financial speculation.
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   When you have a business, you have cash flow,
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   you have customers.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   These are real assets that you can use then
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   to value your business.
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   And you can say, "My business is worth this
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   because we have this amount of cash flow."
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   But with financial speculations,
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   such as big cryptocurrency wins,
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   you wind up facing the reality that you can't value it.
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   It's all--there's no cash flow.
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   The value is based upon market demand.
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   And how do you control market demand?
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   You can't.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   You can only just ride with it.
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   And in many cases, the wins have come so quickly
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   that now what do I do?
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.000]   How do I approach this?
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   And so the advice that I have given
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   has always been to go back to these concepts that I've said,
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   the concept of a ratcheting concept
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   and the concept of what changes your life in the future
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   versus where you are today.
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   If you come from nothing
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   and you wind up as a suddenly newly minted millionaire,
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   losing millionaire status is not an attractive idea
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   because what you've bought for yourself is freedom.
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   If you've got $2 million in the bank,
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   no debts, modest cash flow requirements, et cetera,
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   for the rest of your life,
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   you don't ever have to do anything you don't want to do.
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   You don't ever have to take a job you don't want to have.
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   You don't have to do anything that you don't want to do.
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   And that's really, really valuable.
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:43.000]   And so what I've always counseled is choose the number
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   that you don't ever want to go below again in your life
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   and get that out of the speculative asset
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   and get it into a good financial plan
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   that has a better track record, a better history,
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   a longer run history, et cetera.
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   And there are various ways that you can do that.
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   On the other hand, if you still want to play,
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   then you've got to make sure that you're playing enough
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   to go big.
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   And so it's that same measurement.
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   Okay, let's assume we go to zero.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   How much does that hurt?
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   Let's assume we go to 100x.
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   How much does that win for you?
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   And each person, based upon his own risk tolerance,
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   his own lifestyle ambitions and goals, et cetera,
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   will have a different number.
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   But you can get at the right number.
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:32.000]   When you have investments that go up,
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   take your winnings.
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   Always remember, profits that are not taken off the table
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   are not actual profits.
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   Paper profits are not real profits.
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:45.000]   Money that is up but you don't take it off the table
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   is not actually profits.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:53.000]   For me, I grew of age during the dot-com boom.
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.000]   And I just remember so much.
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   A friend of a friend, kind of a middle-aged guy,
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:59.000]   he started some online business,
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   and all of a sudden he was driving a Porsche.
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.000]   This is the dot-com boom, 2000.
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:05.000]   I was in high school.
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   He's driving a Porsche.
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   He's just making it big.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   And then six months later, the Porsche was sold.
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   And he was back living in his parents' house,
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   totally broke.
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   When you win, no matter how confident you are in the future,
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   go back to your ratchet mechanism and say,
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   "If I can take profits and I can set them aside into cash,
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   then I can fundamentally change the rest of my life."
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   So don't play hot and heavy if you haven't ensured the downside.
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   Take your winnings. Take your profits.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   If you double an investment, take money off the table.
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   If you 5x an investment, take more money off the table.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   If you 10x an investment, take huge amounts of money off the table.
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   Why do I say that?
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   Earlier I used the example of 100x, right?
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   Because it's fun to think about.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:05.000]   And many people, in the massive increase in Bitcoin
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:09.000]   and other cryptocurrency values, have 100x their investment.
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:14.000]   But you cannot 100x something for long at all.
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:19.000]   You can't even go at a 3% growth for long at all.
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:21.000]   And what I mean is, just run the numbers.
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:26.000]   The power of compound interest is always there.
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:31.000]   Some months ago, somebody had gotten involved in some scheme.
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   They came to me and promised extraordinary gains.
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   And I just immediately said, "This is a scam."
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:39.000]   How do I know it's a scam?
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   Because based upon the numbers that somebody is promising you,
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:46.000]   of an increase in your investment,
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   within a very short time, all the money in the world sucked up.
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.000]   You have to run the math.
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   And so, if you ever got one 100x growth in your life, that's it.
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   You're very unlikely to ever get that again.
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:04.000]   And so, recognize. Don't think, "This is normal. I can just keep doing this."
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   You can't. You won't.
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:09.000]   Doubling up, you can do it a few times.
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:12.000]   There are enough assets that if you have enough time, can double up.
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:17.000]   5x something, could you do that once or twice in your life?
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:21.000]   If you can do it more, you'll be in the hallmark, the hall of the heroes.
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   You'll be up there with Elon and Warren and all the great investors.
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:28.000]   Life doesn't work that way.
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:33.000]   There are physical constraints that hold back these assets.
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:38.000]   Any asset. Stock prices, value of the dollar, value of Bitcoin, etc.
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:42.000]   So, when you increase, take your winnings,
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:44.000]   take some of your winnings and deploy them.
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.000]   Do it on a ratcheting scale.
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:51.000]   Again, you can decide the numbers, but don't be stupid and keep everything going
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.000]   in something that has gone well.
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   Recognize that booms are almost always followed by busts.
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   And busts are often followed by booms.
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:06.000]   So, if you're booming, I want to be Mr. Negative and say, "The bust is coming."
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:11.000]   If you're busting, I want to be Mr. Encouragement to say, "Hey, the boom may come."
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.000]   But booms are always followed by busts.
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:17.000]   That's the fundamental nature of humanity.
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:21.000]   We're emotionally driven creatures that get irrationally exuberant when times are good
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:24.000]   and irrationally despondent when times are bad.
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:28.000]   So, I think that's what I wanted to share.
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:31.000]   There are more rules that could be applied to investing.
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:33.000]   I guess the final one I would say is this.
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:38.000]   If you can't explain it to a child, don't do it.
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:45.000]   This came up on the Friday Q&A show where somebody was talking about how--
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:49.000]   somebody was talking about--
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:52.000]   I just slipped my mind, excuse me--
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   oh, advice from an attorney.
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:56.000]   The attorney was saying, "Well, you can do this kind of trust or this kind of trust,"
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.000]   and he couldn't explain it to me.
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.000]   My comment is, "That's the attorney's job.
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:03.000]   If you can't explain to me why the attorney is saying to do it,
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:05.000]   there's a good chance you're being swindled."
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:08.000]   Now, go back to the attorney, give another chance, say, "Maybe I'm just dense
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:10.000]   and I didn't understand. Can you try this again?"
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   But if a financial expert can't explain something simple enough
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:16.000]   so that you clearly understand what it is and why you would want to do it
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:20.000]   or not want to do it, then that person is, in my opinion,
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:25.000]   not doing 101 of his job.
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:26.000]   Flip it to an investment.
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:30.000]   If you can't explain to your child, your elementary school child,
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:34.000]   or your niece, or your nephew, or a random child that you walk up to on the street,
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:40.000]   if you can't explain the basic value proposition of your business
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:42.000]   or of this company you want to invest in,
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:46.000]   or of this computer coin you want to buy,
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:48.000]   or what you're trying to do,
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:53.000]   then the emperor might just have no clothes.
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:57.000]   There might just not be any usefulness to it.
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:01.000]   It's easy to say that when everything is crashing.
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:05.000]   And you're like, "Now, of course, if I just stuck to it, that would be great."
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:07.000]   It's harder to say that when it seems like everyone is winning.
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:13.000]   But at its core, if you can't fundamentally explain the value of this to someone else,
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:17.000]   then you probably shouldn't get involved.
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   It's a sign that it may have no value,
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:24.000]   or you just don't understand it well enough.
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   I'm trying to be cautious here,
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:28.000]   because one of the things that's interesting over the years
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:31.000]   with my involvement in Bitcoin and my Bitcoin education,
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:35.000]   people say, "Well, if I just understand Bitcoin more, then I'll invest in it."
[00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:39.000]   And they go on, "I can't understand it, understand it, understand it."
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:42.000]   And they never understand it, they never invest in it, or they never buy coins.
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:49.000]   But what's funny is that I actually have a very hard time explaining something like a dollar.
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:51.000]   I try to explain it to my children.
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:53.000]   I have a master's degree in financial planning.
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:55.000]   I've been paying attention to finance for 20 years.
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:55:00.000]   I've read hundreds, if not, let's just say hundreds and hundreds of books on money.
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:05.000]   If you ask me today, off the cuff, to explain how money is created,
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:10.000]   it is such a convoluted, ridiculous system that it's exceedingly difficult for me to do.
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.000]   Now, there may be a lesson in that.
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:18.000]   Maybe that's the fundamental truth of the fakeness of money.
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:20.000]   Money really is fake.
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:27.000]   And so I can explain it as long as I just focus on the utility of money,
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:30.000]   the fact that it has value because everybody wants it,
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:32.000]   and when everybody doesn't want it, it no longer has value.
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:33.000]   I can explain that.
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:37.000]   When you try to explain how a dollar is magically created out of thin air,
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:39.000]   it's remarkably difficult to explain.
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:42.000]   So you've got to be careful, because sometimes that can go too far.
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:47.000]   But at its core, you should have some concept of how to explain this.
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:53.000]   If I explain Bitcoin to somebody, I can do it simply in about a minute
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:58.000]   to the point where you say, "Okay, if that works, and if people like how that works,
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:01.000]   I can understand what the utility of that is."
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:03.000]   Or some coins.
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:07.000]   But then there are other ones where it's just so obviously difficult,
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:10.000]   you're involved in a scam.
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:14.000]   So that's all I have to say.
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:18.000]   I'll close with this because I don't know if I'll actually make the other show or not.
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:25.000]   If you are in the midst of collapse, if your trading account on FTX is wiped out,
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:31.000]   if you've lost half your net worth, et cetera, what I beg of you is do not become despondent.
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:36.000]   Do not--in fact, I'm going to go for just a couple more minutes
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:37.000]   because I need to say this.
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:38.000]   This is important.
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:39.000]   It could save lives.
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:42.000]   I've been wanting to do a show on "Don't kill yourself over something so stupid
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:44.000]   that it's going to kill you for a while."
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:47.000]   But we'll just start with this comment.
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:49.000]   It was on Twitter this morning.
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:52.000]   And there was a crypto guy who was saying, "The last few days in the crypto world
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:54.000]   have sucked a lot."
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:57.000]   And a random person says, "I've lost almost everything.
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:58.000]   I don't know what to do."
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:56:59.000]   Here's my answer.
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:01.000]   Number one, cry.
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:02.000]   Have a good cry.
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:04.000]   Be angry.
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:08.000]   Embrace the emotions of the moment.
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:11.000]   Acknowledge the emotions.
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:12.000]   I'm sure you've gotten past it.
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:13.000]   It may take a day.
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:14.000]   It may take five days.
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:18.000]   For me, usually one or two nights of sleep can change things.
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:23.000]   There are times where something happens, my emotions are so upset that I feel sick to my stomach.
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:26.000]   I get a tingly feeling all over my body.
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:29.000]   Usually if I can get one night's sleep, then I can see everything clear.
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:31.000]   Everything's clear in the morning.
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:35.000]   So cry, be angry, be upset, get a night's sleep, and then with a calm head,
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:39.000]   come back and study your options and see if anything can be recovered.
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:40.000]   Can you get your money out?
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:42.000]   Can you hedge your bets in some way?
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:46.000]   Can you minimize your risk on the rest of your portfolio?
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:47.000]   Study your options.
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:54.000]   Then the most important thing is exercise and sunlight and relationships.
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:55.000]   Go for a walk.
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:56.000]   Go in the sunshine.
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:57.000]   Get sunlight.
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:00.000]   Get exercise and get relationships.
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:02.000]   And be with other people.
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:03.000]   Don't be alone.
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:09.000]   I know what it's like to be in a dark place mentally.
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:13.000]   In fact, interestingly, the last months of my life have been some of the darkest of my life.
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:16.000]   And it's not because anything is wrong.
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:20.000]   It's just emotionally you get into those black periods.
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:22.000]   And so you've got to start with what you can start with.
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:28.000]   And so exercise, sunlight, relationships, friendships, being with other people, et cetera.
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:31.000]   Then in terms of money, the situation is easy.
[00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:34.000]   If you don't have a job, you go get a job.
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:37.000]   If you don't have a job, you go get a job.
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:39.000]   You start earning money.
[00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:42.000]   Once you're earning money, you can figure out how much you can afford to live on.
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:44.000]   You can start saving money.
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:46.000]   You can start the process over again.
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:47.000]   But you simply need a job.
[00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:49.000]   You need work.
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:52.000]   And then some people, you might have to sell a house.
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:55.000]   You might have to dump some stuff.
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:56.000]   You might have to stop paying bills.
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:58.000]   You might have to go through bankruptcy.
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:02.000]   But the point is in our modern day, one of the things that we're very, very fortunate is
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:09.000]   you're not going to die from a financial mistake unless you literally choose to kill yourself,
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:13.000]   which is stupid because it's just money.
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.000]   Recognize it's all fake.
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:16.000]   It was always fake.
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:18.000]   It is always fake.
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:19.000]   Money is fake.
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:21.000]   It's made up out of thin air.
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:22.000]   It doesn't exist.
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:27.000]   It's an imaginary concept that we use to try to organize society.
[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:30.000]   If you lose all your money, it was all fake in the beginning.
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:32.000]   And you can press forward.
[00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:34.000]   And you can make it all back.
[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:38.000]   Most millionaires have gone completely broke at least a couple times.
[00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:45.000]   And because money is fake, in the same way that it can go quickly, it can come quickly.
[00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:47.000]   You can mint another fortune quickly.
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:52.000]   It may take 10 years, but 10 years of work puts you in a dramatically different place,
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:53.000]   and it's worth it.
[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:58.000]   The only thing that ends your life is literally if you end your life.
[00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000]   Don't do it.
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.000]   It's stupid.
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:06.000]   Stupid causes irreparable harm to you and to everyone around you.
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000]   It's only money.
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:11.000]   Number one, just stop paying bills if you need to.
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:15.000]   The entire system can collapse around you, meaning the personal system, people.
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:18.000]   We all take risks when we lend money to people, et cetera.
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:21.000]   I had somebody--I lent someone a lot of money.
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:26.000]   Did it going in--last couple years, did it going in, knowing that it may not be returned.
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:29.000]   It wasn't returned.
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.000]   Write it off.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000]   You can declare bankruptcy.
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.000]   Bankruptcy will end most of your financial obligations.
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.000]   You can dig into the various kinds of bankruptcy and choose one that's right for you.
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:44.000]   But bankruptcy can control your creditors in a powerful way, and you can start over again.
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:47.000]   There's nobody who can't start over again.
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000]   So recognize it's only money.
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000]   Most people go broke a couple times before they make it.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:54.000]   You'll learn your lessons, and you'll press on.
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.000]   It's all fake.
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:58.000]   It's all fake, the money stuff.
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:05.000]   So I guess my plea with you is if you're in a dark place, don't do the things that are irreparable.
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.000]   Don't end your life.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000]   Take a few days, and then just get back.
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:22.000]   Sunshine, exercise, a job, social contact, work steadily.
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:26.000]   I hope these rules help some of you to avoid the catastrophe that many people are facing right now.
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:33.000]   I hope that FTX can recover in some way and make whole the people who have depended upon it in some way.
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.000]   I wish you a great day.
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:42.000]   Remember that if you want to learn how to buy Bitcoin and other coins, but primarily Bitcoin,
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:49.000]   in a way where it's actually protected from things like the collapse of the second largest exchange out there,
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:54.000]   go to BitcoinPrivacyCourse.com.
