[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.960]   - Good Monday.
[00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.200]   Today's question on the table asks,
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.640]   why God chose the foolish things of the world
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.040]   and not the wise and powerful?
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.640]   Why not use the wealthiest innovators
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.500]   and the smartest geniuses and the most articulate orators
[00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:22.840]   and the world's greatest athletes
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.520]   and most recognizable movie stars
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.880]   to spread his gospel around the world?
[00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.880]   Why does God prefer to choose and use
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.160]   the weak in his mission?
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.200]   The question comes from a podcast listener
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.920]   by the name of Euclid, who lives in the Philippines.
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.080]   Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.920]   I have given my life to the Great Commission
[00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.760]   and desire to share the gospel to all nations.
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.840]   In 1 Corinthians 1:27, it says that God chose
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.380]   what is foolish in the world to shame the wise.
[00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.880]   God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong.
[00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.820]   Here's my question.
[00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.180]   Why didn't God save all the worldly wise
[00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.780]   to proclaim the gospel to the whole world?
[00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.740]   Wouldn't that have made a faster and greater impact
[00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.660]   in world evangelization than simply choosing
[00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.200]   a bunch of foolish people to do his work?
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.200]   - Well, praise God that he chooses to use his foolish people.
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.040]   (laughing)
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.860]   - Amen.
[00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.660]   - The answer, the first answer I'd say is
[00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.340]   the impact of all those wise people,
[00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.220]   all those smart people, those intellectual people,
[00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.320]   those gifted people might have been faster
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.140]   and might have been outwardly greater,
[00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.940]   but it wouldn't have been Christianity.
[00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:36.960]   - Yeah.
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.340]   - If the son of God had come into the world as a warrior
[00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.380]   or a philosopher to impact the world
[00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.480]   with his power and his intelligence,
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.100]   the impact would have been quicker
[00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.660]   and more outwardly impressive,
[00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.620]   but it wouldn't have been Christianity.
[00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.960]   We can hardly overestimate,
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.940]   and I've been impressed with this so much recently
[00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.260]   working through 1 Corinthians for a look at the book.
[00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:13.020]   We can hardly overestimate the importance
[00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.980]   of the decision God made in heaven,
[00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.820]   indeed before the foundation of the world,
[00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.820]   that he would redeem a people and define a people
[00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:30.020]   through the weakest and most despicable death imaginable,
[00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:36.060]   the slaughtering by crucifixion of Jesus Christ,
[00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.260]   the son of God.
[00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.380]   It was a scandal, a stumbling block,
[00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.380]   an absolute foolishness, a shame, an utter indignity,
[00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.560]   and that is how we are saved.
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.040]   That is how the gospel triumphs.
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.240]   The entire first three chapters of Paul's letter
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.540]   to the Corinthians is written to clarify
[00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.920]   for the Corinthians and us
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.640]   that Christianity will not be defined by
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.640]   or it will not spread by the excellence of human oratory
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.320]   or the impressiveness of human intellect.
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.520]   Those two focuses, the pride in Corinth,
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.160]   were the great oratory and the great intellect.
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.360]   And evidently, the Corinthian church
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.360]   was quite enamored by these things.
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.840]   They were boasting by saying, "I am of Paul.
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:35.880]   "I am of Apollos.
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.280]   "I am of Cephas."
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.480]   And they were finding borrowed boasting,
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.160]   borrowed celebrity, borrowed praise
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.880]   by lining up behind the teacher
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.020]   that they thought would be superior
[00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.620]   in oratory or intellect.
[00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.040]   And Paul devoted three chapters
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.320]   to showing why this is not the meaning of Christianity,
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.160]   nor is it the way forward for Christianity.
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.160]   When Paul heard that they were saying, "I am of Paul,"
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:12.960]   he cried out, "What, was Paul crucified for you?"
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.680]   It's good to believe that they were turning
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.800]   the message of Christ crucified
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.800]   into a matter of boasting in his skills.
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.920]   Then three verses later, he says,
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.120]   "Christ sent me to preach the gospel
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.840]   "not with words of eloquent wisdom,
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.340]   "lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power."
[00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.100]   Those were the two issues, human eloquence,
[00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.680]   human intellect, oratory, erudition,
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.480]   clever with words, sharp with brainpower.
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.400]   These were the great focuses
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.000]   of admiration and pride in Corinth.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.320]   And Paul said, in effect,
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:00.080]   oratory and intellect might get bigger crowds,
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.920]   might get bigger acclaim,
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.680]   might have a quicker impact on the public,
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.420]   but it wouldn't be Christianity.
[00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:13.080]   It would, in fact, be a denial of Christ
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.920]   and an emptying of the cross
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.960]   because the cross of Christ
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.400]   means the end of boasting in human achievements.
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.440]   It means the replacing of that kind of boasting
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:32.440]   with Christ-exalting, childlike trust in a Redeemer
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:37.740]   because of how desperately needy and sinful we are.
[00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:42.300]   The cross of Christ isn't just Christ's death,
[00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.660]   it's our death.
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.680]   I am crucified with Christ,
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.040]   crucified to the self-salvation
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.700]   and self-exaltation of pride.
[00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:58.140]   Then in chapter one, verse 18, Paul says,
[00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:02.800]   "The cross is foolishness to those who are perishing,
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:07.800]   "but to us who are being saved, it is the power of God."
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:12.640]   Then in that amazing verse 21, three verses later,
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:16.160]   he tells us why human wisdom,
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.040]   human intellect, reason,
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.040]   what we are by nature alone,
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.840]   why intellect, reason, nature
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:30.480]   cannot find ultimate wisdom in God or salvation.
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.880]   Here's what he says.
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:36.100]   "Since in the wisdom of God," that's the key phrase,
[00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.920]   "by and in the wisdom of God,
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:42.040]   "the world did not know God through wisdom.
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:45.080]   "It pleased God through the foolishness of what we preach
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.120]   "to save those who believe."
[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:53.000]   God's wisdom decided that human wisdom
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.360]   would not be the way of salvation.
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:59.700]   Rather, faith in divine foolishness
[00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:01.720]   would be the way of salvation.
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:06.720]   Verse 25, "The foolishness of God is wiser than men
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:11.540]   "and the weakness of God is stronger than men."
[00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:14.940]   And the point to emphasize for our friend Euclid
[00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:18.580]   in the Philippines is it never looks like that.
[00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:20.020]   It never looks like it.
[00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:22.620]   The foolishness of God is wiser than men,
[00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.700]   but it doesn't look like it.
[00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:26.460]   It looks like foolishness.
[00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:29.460]   And the weakness of God is stronger than men,
[00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:31.220]   but it doesn't look like it.
[00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:32.600]   It looks like weakness.
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.560]   That's Christianity.
[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:39.700]   This is the way the gospel advances in the world.
[00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:42.680]   Paul says it again in chapter two, verse one,
[00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.220]   "When I came to you, brothers,
[00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:49.220]   "I did not come in with lofty speech or wisdom."
[00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:51.520]   There it is again, lofty speech,
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:54.660]   skillful, impressive Greek eloquence or wisdom,
[00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:56.460]   philosophical impressiveness.
[00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:57.860]   Why, Paul?
[00:07:57.860 --> 00:07:59.540]   That's what Euclid is asking.
[00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:03.780]   Why not use lofty speech and human intellect?
[00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:06.780]   And verse five gives the answer.
[00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:08.380]   Chapter two, verse five,
[00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:12.260]   "So that your faith might not rest in the wisdom of men,
[00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:13.560]   "but in the power of God."
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:19.540]   Now, Euclid began by quoting 1 Corinthians 1:27
[00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:24.460]   and asking, "Why didn't God save all the worldly wise
[00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:26.080]   "to proclaim the gospel to the whole world?
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:28.880]   "Wouldn't that have made a faster and greater impact
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:30.620]   "in world evangelization?"
[00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:35.100]   So let's end where Euclid began,
[00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:38.340]   because that paragraph gives two clear answers
[00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:41.580]   to the question, why wouldn't God do it that way?
[00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:42.720]   Here's what he says.
[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.700]   "Consider your calling, brothers.
[00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:47.680]   "Not many of you were wise according to worldly standards.
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.480]   "Not many were powerful.
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:52.000]   "Not many were of noble birth.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.160]   "But God chose what is foolish in the world
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.180]   "to shame the wise.
[00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:00.980]   "God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong.
[00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:04.100]   "God chose what is low and despised in the world,
[00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:06.000]   "even things that are not,
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.460]   "to bring to nothing things that are."
[00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:09.980]   And here's his first answer.
[00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:14.900]   "So that no human being might boast
[00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:16.300]   "in the presence of God."
[00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:18.640]   And then he continues.
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:20.980]   "And because of him," because of God,
[00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:22.640]   "you are in Christ Jesus,
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:25.080]   "who became to us wisdom from God,
[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.520]   "righteousness, sanctification, and redemption,
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:29.860]   "so that," and here's the second answer,
[00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:34.500]   "as it is written, let the one who boasts,
[00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:36.080]   "boast in the Lord."
[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:40.400]   So why not spread the gospel among the nations faster
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.840]   and with greater impact through wise,
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:45.580]   powerful, noble-born people?
[00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:46.420]   Two answers.
[00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:50.480]   One, so that no human might boast in the presence of God.
[00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.860]   Number two, so that those who boast
[00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:56.040]   would boast only in the Lord.
[00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:59.520]   God's aim in world evangelization
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:04.280]   is to put an end to human pride
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:09.280]   and to make Jesus the focus of all human praise.
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:11.900]   His ways are not our ways.
[00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:13.660]   We just need to settle it.
[00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:16.180]   His ways are not our ways.
[00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:21.000]   Christ crucified defines everything.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:21.940]   - Amen, Pastor John.
[00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:25.140]   The cross of Christ defines everything, all of it.
[00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:29.780]   When it comes to the means, the message, and the messengers,
[00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:32.540]   God's entire mission is shaped by the foolishness
[00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:34.100]   of the cross of Christ.
[00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:35.960]   That's why Paul can say we are completing
[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:39.480]   or filling up Christ's afflictions as we reach the world.
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.900]   All those connections really landed on me recently
[00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:44.620]   as I wrote a book, a summary of the first decade
[00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:45.500]   of this podcast.
[00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:47.920]   We'll be talking about that in the coming months.
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:49.980]   I took our first 10 years of episodes
[00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:53.360]   and synthesized them thematically into one big book
[00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:56.900]   that will be released in early 2024.
[00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:58.460]   But this point resonated with me
[00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:00.580]   as I wrote that section on this theme.
[00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:03.500]   It's not despite our weakness and suffering,
[00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:07.220]   but it's through our suffering that we reach the world
[00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:11.320]   with the message of the suffering Christ on the cross.
[00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:14.980]   Glorious, profound, counterintuitive,
[00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:19.720]   and entirely contrary to the claims of prosperity preachers.
[00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:21.880]   The implications are far and wide.
[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:24.180]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:26.100]   We'll see you back here on Thursday
[00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:28.020]   where Pastor John applies all of this
[00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:31.200]   and shares the gospel with a non-believer.
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.140]   We'll see you then.
[00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:34.720]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:37.300]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:47.300]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
