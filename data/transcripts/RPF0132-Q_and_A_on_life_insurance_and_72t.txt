[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.520]   Gonna respond to Sean's question about how to approach life insurance planning for his kids.
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.680]   Clear up some stuff for Chris on 72(t) withdrawals for early retirees.
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.800]   Basically, how do I pump a bunch of money into my 401(k) accounts and then retire at 50?
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.960]   Does 72(t) work for that?
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.680]   Melissa has some questions about the much-vaunted mortgage acceleration program,
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.320]   which is the idea where you use a home equity line of credit to pay off your principal mortgage
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.640]   in order to pay it off faster.
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.440]   Robert has some questions about his wife's non-qualified deferred comp pension plan

[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.760]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance podcast.
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:55.280]   My name is Joshua Sheets. Today is Monday, January 12, 2015.
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.880]   This is the show where I hustle every day to try to clear up all of your questions
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.320]   and give you a little bit of a guiding light on your path to financial independence.
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.120]   A couple days late with today's Q&A show, but it's going to be worth it.
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.000]   I expect it to be long, but worth it.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:20.080]   ♪
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.760]   It's been an interesting week last week and an interesting day even today.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.120]   As I record this right now, it's about 8.30 as I sit down and hit start.
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.400]   I do expect this show to be fairly lengthy, but it is going to be packed.
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.360]   So, feel free to split it up into multiple set listening sessions if you need to.
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.480]   But it's been a busy week around the Sheets household.
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.080]   After getting back from the break, and by the way,
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.000]   if you want to skip straight to the questions,
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.320]   just check for the timestamp and you can go straight to question one.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:50.560]   But getting back from the break was an interesting experience this year.
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.280]   I had lined up the shows to release while I was out of town over Christmas vacation.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.640]   And I was fortunate prior to Christmas vacation,
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.120]   I'd built up a backlog of about six shows in advance.
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:09.440]   And those shows were helpful to me as they allowed me to...
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:15.360]   Well, it was useful to be ahead a little bit during the normal course of the week.
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.600]   But getting back from vacation, I just got overwhelmed with digging out from email.
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.320]   And then to compound it, I wound up getting sick.
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.320]   So, last week I had released a show on Tuesday and on Wednesday.
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.320]   And I had shows planned for Thursday and Friday.
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.640]   But man, Thursday and Friday, I was flat on my back on...
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.440]   Yeah, I was sick and I wasn't able to get the shows done.
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.840]   That was a little bit disappointing to me.
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.200]   It kind of broke my streak.
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:45.520]   That was the fewest shows released in a week ever, actually, since I started doing the show.
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.120]   But good things, good things all around.
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.800]   What I was reminded of, even today, as I record this later in the evening today,
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.320]   it's been a neat day with my family.
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.720]   And even just last week, even though it was a busy week and it was a week of being sick,
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.680]   I was reminded about the benefits of entrepreneurship
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.960]   and being able to have a little bit of autonomy over my schedule.
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.760]   I haven't shared on the news yet, but on this show,
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.240]   so I'll go ahead and make the announcement right here.
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:18.640]   But there have been a lot of challenges in my family over the last few months.
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.880]   And they've been really great things.
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.800]   My wife and I are expecting a baby.
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.880]   And so, that has been super exciting for us.
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.160]   It'll be here, hopefully, about summer of 2015.
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.440]   And so, that kind of gives me a neat kind of bracketing to my year,
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.360]   as far as to expect a baby in the summer.
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.640]   But the last few months have been very challenging around the household.
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.800]   She's had to work through some of the morning sickness for the last few months.
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.720]   And she's hardly been able to cook anything for the last few months.
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.440]   So, I've been doing most of the cooking.
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.480]   And she's been pretty sick, actually, this time around.
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:58.400]   So, that brings a lot of extra challenges to the household.
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.960]   But it also brings a lot of the blessings.
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.440]   And I've appreciated, even over the last few months,
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.400]   how simply due to being able to work from home on a flexible schedule,
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:14.160]   how I can mix up my working schedule in such a way
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.040]   that it actually works with my family's schedule.
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.240]   So, I do a lot of work early in the morning before they're up,
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.680]   later in the evening after they're in bed,
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.840]   and then a lot of times during nap times, things like that.
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:26.880]   So, it's just a real blessing.
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.720]   And even today, as I was working on it last week,
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.520]   in addition to my being sick, her being sick,
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.040]   the dogs also needed some veterinary care.
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:40.560]   And we're in the process of interviewing different midwives
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.480]   and trying to figure out who we're going to work with this baby.
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.800]   And even this morning, I had to flip the whole schedule upside down
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.320]   to have some morning appointments.
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.400]   And it was just a cool experience for me to be able to get up
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.640]   and actually took my family out for breakfast.
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:57.920]   It was neat. It was a beautiful day.
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:02.240]   And so, we went for breakfast in Stewart prior to some appointments
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.320]   and just being able to gain control of the day.
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:10.240]   And an encouragement to all of you who may feel frustrated,
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.240]   as I often used to feel,
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.760]   is that it wasn't that I didn't want to work.
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:18.800]   It was that I wanted a little bit of control over just my daily schedule
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.480]   and my ability to be with my family when they needed me
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.960]   and the ability to get my work done, but do it on a flexible schedule.
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.880]   And then I have days where you get sick
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.280]   and sometimes you just can't get the work done,
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.760]   at least when you desire to.
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.840]   But to me, it seems, as I've said many times on the show,
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.800]   it seems that many of the benefits that many of us desire
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:46.320]   from being financially independent can be achieved in a shorter time frame
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:50.080]   just simply by building up our own business
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.120]   or building up some sort of remote work agreement,
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.920]   just essentially regaining control of our schedules.
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.560]   And certainly many of us have occupations
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.360]   for which that's not going to be possible.
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:06.240]   If you are on call and you are an emergency room physician,
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.000]   you need to be there on the hours that you're there
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.760]   because the emergency room needs to be staffed.
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.760]   And all of us will have our own unique occupations.
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:19.120]   But at least for me, I'm grateful to be able to shut the show down
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.520]   for a day or two when I'm sick just to be able to recover,
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.720]   focus on my health and just try to get better.
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:28.240]   I'm grateful to be able to love and serve my family
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:31.840]   and to just simply discharge the responsibilities
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:33.360]   in a way that I'm able to do so.
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.200]   It's a real benefit and a real blessing.
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.960]   Thank you to all of you who are listening
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:40.960]   and who are helping this personal business get going.
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.160]   So just a little bit of appreciation.
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:48.160]   It was a neat day and I've been excited about today's show.
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.040]   I've put a lot of effort into just creating my thoughts
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.760]   and hopefully it'll be compelling to you.
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.280]   But I just want to share that with you.
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:56.400]   A, to announce our news.
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.960]   We finally were able to announce it to our family over Christmas,
[00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.480]   so that was exciting.
[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.800]   And I wanted to share it with all of you.
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:04.960]   It's going to be a neat experience for the year.
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:08.320]   So take heart, keep working strong.
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.880]   Those of you who have a desire to run your own business
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.600]   or be involved and get more control over your schedule
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:17.040]   and to be able to have more facets of your life fully integrated,
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.560]   which is my desire.
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.160]   I don't want my life to be siloed
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.880]   like it seems to be in our modern culture.
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:23.840]   It so easily is.
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:26.560]   I desire for my life to be more integrated
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:29.200]   and not a millionaire yet,
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:33.360]   but I'm able to enjoy the benefits of having an integrated life.
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:36.320]   My wife was remarking, even this afternoon as we were driving home,
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:39.920]   she was talking about how nice it was
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:42.480]   not to have to schedule an appointment at a certain time
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:46.880]   and rush out from an employer and have to be back in 90 minutes
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:50.640]   and feel all stressed and frantic about just things changing
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:53.200]   and things being mixed up.
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:56.160]   It's just nice to have a little bit of control over your schedule.
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.720]   So I hope that's encouraging to some of you.
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:02.000]   I'm doing my best to get back in the swing of things,
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.200]   get on the routine here.
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.760]   I didn't realize how much it hurt not to have interviews in the can,
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.240]   so I'm going to try to build those up as much as possible
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.920]   and get back into the swing of things here.
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:11.680]   But let's get to the questions now.
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:15.680]   And we're actually going to start with a question from Sean.
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.680]   - Hey, Joshua.
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:18.640]   My name is Sean.
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:20.240]   I listen to your show quite a bit.
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.840]   I just was listening to one of your shows
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.280]   where you were talking about the program
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:29.280]   that you were going to set up regarding for do-it-yourselfers.
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:35.280]   And funny enough, I've been having this question on my mind for a while.
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:38.000]   I have two kids.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.920]   One was just recently born and another one is two and a half
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:45.040]   and interested in buying life insurance.
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:48.320]   And I consider myself a do-it-yourselfer.
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:53.120]   At the same time, I would love some kind of program
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.760]   to be able to get an introduction to life insurance
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:10:02.560]   because I'm going to start that process to go acquire it.
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:08.560]   And I'm not sure if you have anything in your program that's beta regarding that topic,
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:12.160]   but if you're looking for someone to kind of test it out on,
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:16.320]   I'd be very interested in the program that you're putting together for that.
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:20.640]   And you could use me as a beta.
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:22.560]   The process I'd be willing to pay as well.
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:27.440]   But I really want to get educated on what is life insurance
[00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:32.320]   and be educated when I do go to purchase it
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:35.600]   that I'm well suited to make a good decision.
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:39.600]   Anyway, I love your show and thanks so much.
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:40.720]   Talk to you soon.
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:43.440]   It's a great question, Sean, and I thank you for calling it in.
[00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:47.520]   I don't know when I'll be able to actually get the program
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:51.120]   or get the educational materials that I mentioned established.
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.760]   So I'm good at giving information away for free
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:58.080]   and not so great at actually making money on it yet.
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:01.200]   So I'll go and give you a little bit of insight for free.
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.120]   Hopefully that'll help you to make some good decisions
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:06.560]   and then join the Irregulars Membership Program.
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:07.600]   That'll be the most helpful.
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:10.800]   So real quick on life insurance.
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.160]   Life insurance is actually one of those things
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.480]   where it's very difficult to be a DIYer.
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:17.360]   And the reason is that to the best of my knowledge,
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.600]   I have never found any company
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:23.040]   that sells insurance products without commissions.
[00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:26.240]   So regardless of what choice you make
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:29.040]   with life insurance products,
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:31.120]   there is going to be a commission involved,
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.080]   which means you're gonna be working
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:33.680]   with a life insurance agent.
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:36.400]   Even if you call one of the people that advertise on TV,
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.160]   they're selling exactly the same product
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.440]   that a local life insurance salesperson is selling
[00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:43.280]   at exactly the same rates.
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:46.080]   And they're just simply receiving the commission
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.840]   based upon their TV advertisement
[00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:49.600]   instead of working with a local agent.
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:51.840]   So I think life insurance is one of those things
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:54.880]   where you're well served by finding a local agent.
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:56.720]   Now, I do think you're well equipped.
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:59.600]   It's important to be well equipped
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:02.160]   in advance of that conversation to understand a little bit
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:04.240]   and that'll help you to make good decisions.
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.040]   But it's one of those areas where it's difficult
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:08.640]   to be a DIYer.
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:11.680]   There are no insurance companies
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.280]   that sell direct to the consumer
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:16.240]   without an agency structure,
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.720]   at least that I've ever found or that I'm aware of.
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:20.400]   And the ones that do,
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:23.680]   I should caveat that a little bit.
[00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.400]   There are a couple of companies that write themselves,
[00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:27.680]   put it this way,
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:29.520]   there are no competitive companies with products
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:30.880]   that I've reviewed so far
[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:34.640]   that I would actually perceive to be market-leading products
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:36.720]   that sell directly to the consumer.
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:37.840]   And I think a life insurance agent
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:38.480]   can be valuable.
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:39.440]   Let me give you some ideas.
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.280]   So life insurance for kids,
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:43.040]   and to be specific,
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:45.920]   we're not talking about you and your wife
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:48.240]   having life insurance policies on your life
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:51.120]   to protect them for which they would be the beneficiary.
[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.760]   We're talking about life insurance policies
[00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:55.200]   on your kids' lives.
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:59.440]   And this is actually one of the more controversial subjects
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:00.880]   in financial planning.
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:05.520]   You can read scathing essays on all sides of this issue,
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:07.520]   giving all kinds of advice.
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:10.960]   So I'll tell you how I parse the advice out,
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:12.960]   and I'll add my opinion to it.
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:15.680]   It is important to recognize at the beginning
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:19.520]   that this is actually a challenging area to plan in
[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:22.560]   because it's so emotional for many people.
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:28.400]   Many people have a very difficult time talking about it,
[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:29.200]   thinking about it,
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.800]   thinking about their child dying,
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:33.600]   thinking about what they would do if their child died.
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:34.880]   It's just a tough, tough,
[00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:38.080]   intensely emotional issue for people.
[00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:40.080]   And I think that's why the financial advice
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:43.280]   that is proffered on this subject is so varied.
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:46.320]   And so the rhetoric is so intense.
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:50.320]   It's because of the emotional intensity
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:52.000]   that exists for most people.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.480]   I've actually have the privilege, I guess,
[00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:59.520]   misfortune, fortune of being able to be
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:00.960]   a little bit closer to the issue.
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:04.080]   My wife and I, we haven't lost a child,
[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:09.040]   but I had a sister who died as an early teenager in my family.
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:10.800]   And I was younger than she was,
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:14.000]   but because of that, she had an illness
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.080]   and she died as an early teen.
[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:17.680]   And so in working through that,
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:20.480]   I was able to see some of that from a close perspective
[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:23.760]   in my family and was able to talk with my parents about it
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:26.640]   and learn some of what they've learned through it.
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:30.400]   One, I guess, just thought I would share on that
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:34.720]   is that it's very rare that finances
[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:38.080]   are the major aspect of this.
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:41.920]   When a family loses a child, it's very rare that finance
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:44.160]   is at the center of the conversation.
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:47.040]   But I do believe that finances
[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:50.000]   and having planned for that possibility
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.400]   can make a big difference.
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:54.080]   One of the most heart-wrenching statistics
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:58.160]   that I read sometimes is the number of families who,
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:01.360]   number of marriages that are broken apart
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:02.480]   after the death of a child.
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:06.080]   If you are, one of the things you need to be very aware of,
[00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:08.400]   if you and your spouse ever lose a child,
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:13.600]   that that is, I don't remember the statistics,
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:19.920]   but it is a major, major, major problem in many marriages.
[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:24.000]   And you had better know that and start fighting for it.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   Because in dealing with the emotion
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.480]   and dealing with all of the guilt,
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:32.160]   everything that's associated with that, plan for that.
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:34.640]   That's been the number one piece of advice I've had
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:37.120]   when talking to people who have gone through that
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:39.600]   is you need to immediately focus on your marriage,
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:42.560]   immediately get help, immediately get counseling,
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:44.960]   and don't short-circuit that.
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:47.760]   Because you've got to emerge from that event
[00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:49.040]   with your marriage intact.
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:52.160]   And I do think, again, that having some financial planning
[00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:54.400]   in place can help.
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:58.080]   So this is an issue that's important to me
[00:15:58.080 --> 00:15:59.360]   for, I guess, three reasons.
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:01.840]   Number one, I have a sister who died.
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:03.520]   Been through it with that.
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:05.520]   Number two, I've had clients that I've worked with,
[00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:07.520]   and prospective clients,
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:09.840]   and I won't share any case details,
[00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:13.760]   but one of the most heart-wrenching scenarios in my life
[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:19.360]   was a child that I actually wrote a life insurance policy on.
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:23.040]   And then the parents later discontinued the policy,
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:24.400]   and then the child died.
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:27.040]   And they needed the insurance desperately.
[00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:34.960]   And it was a very difficult responsibility to feel
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:36.000]   as the planner.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.240]   And I again and again racked my brains.
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:40.000]   Is there something I could have done differently
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.880]   to have kept the insurance in force for them?
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:44.720]   It was really tough for me.
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:46.000]   And then it's also just important to me
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.480]   because I have kids, two kids now,
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:52.880]   one who's pre-born and one who's young.
[00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:54.640]   So I've done planning for my own kids,
[00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:55.600]   which I'll get to in a minute.
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:57.200]   So let's talk about philosophies.
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:59.280]   There are three major philosophies
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:01.440]   in mainstream personal finance
[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:03.040]   that I have been able to identify
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:05.440]   when people talk about this issue.
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:09.680]   And those philosophies are primarily about
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:12.080]   the purpose and the amount of the insurance.
[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:17.200]   The first major philosophy is actually the least common.
[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:20.320]   And essentially it's this.
[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:25.440]   As a parent, you invest heavily in your children.
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:28.080]   And financially, you invest heavily.
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:31.520]   You invest a lot of money in paying for their birth.
[00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:33.840]   For some people, paying for their conception
[00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:35.440]   or paying for their adoption.
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:39.280]   Some people, you invest heavily in their birth.
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:41.360]   You invest heavily in their care
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:43.680]   and their nurture over the years,
[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:47.040]   whether that's from the perspective of providing
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:50.560]   food and housing, providing entertainment,
[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:52.560]   providing educational opportunities.
[00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:56.640]   As parents, we invest heavily in our kids.
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:00.640]   And so based upon that, some people have the philosophy
[00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:04.320]   that because you've invested heavily in your child,
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:05.680]   you need to protect yourself
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:08.880]   such that your investment will pay off.
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:11.120]   If your child dies prematurely,
[00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:14.880]   then your investment is essentially for naught.
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:19.120]   So therefore, you should buy a lot of life insurance
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:19.840]   on their life.
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:22.800]   Now, this is every parent I've ever mentioned
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:26.400]   and given Joshua's little three philosophy speech to.
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:31.360]   Every parent that I've ever mentioned that to you
[00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:33.680]   is kind of in the US has looked at me and said,
[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:35.280]   "Are you nuts?
[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:36.080]   What's wrong with you?"
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:38.960]   This is a philosophy that almost no one in the US
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:40.240]   actually goes for.
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:43.680]   But that frankly, I think much of the world
[00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:46.320]   will, does naturally understand this.
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:49.280]   We do spend a lot of money on our kids.
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:50.880]   And in the United States, at least,
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:54.880]   maybe in Canada too, or other, I don't know,
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:57.600]   other societies, we've developed the idea
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:59.600]   that we do so and then we send them off
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:01.120]   and then we never rely on them.
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:03.920]   We develop our kids and we send them off
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:05.600]   and we get them out of the house at 18 years old
[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:07.040]   and they're done, they're gone, they're on our own.
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:08.640]   Now we're gonna do our own thing.
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:12.560]   We have this very can-do spirit about us that says,
[00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:15.200]   "Yes, I do that and then I'm gonna send the kids off."
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:19.280]   And so we view ourselves in fact as failures if we don't.
[00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:23.360]   So in the US American culture, we would view ourselves,
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:26.800]   generally speaking, as a failed adult
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:30.320]   if we find ourselves dependent upon our children
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:31.280]   in our old age.
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:36.000]   I think it's a little foolish, frankly.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.680]   I prefer the more integrated family cultures
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:41.040]   that exist in much of the world.
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:44.880]   And I think it's a little foolish actually
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:46.720]   practically in the US American context.
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:50.160]   The fact is that we do depend on our children financially
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:52.720]   and the numbers and the trends and the statistics
[00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:56.320]   indicate that even more people are going to in fact
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:59.040]   be depending upon their children in their old age.
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:02.160]   I've seen this in various trends.
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:04.880]   I'm interested, I mentioned on a recent show
[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:09.360]   about the fact that some of the more home models,
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:11.920]   floor plan models for model homes
[00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:13.920]   from some of the large home builders,
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:17.200]   it's becoming quite popular to purchase a home
[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:21.680]   with an included suite for extended family.
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:24.240]   So whether that's built into the house
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:26.320]   or whether that's an attached garage
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:28.400]   or an attached apartment, something like that,
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:31.840]   that's become a growing trend in the home building industry.
[00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:33.120]   If you just look at the statistics
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:35.760]   on the amount of money that the average US American
[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:38.720]   actually has and the amount of money
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:41.200]   upon which the average US American
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:42.800]   is actually going to retire,
[00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.360]   it's clear that it's not possible
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:46.720]   to live on that amount of money.
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:49.520]   And then as going forward
[00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:52.960]   as the US entitlement programs constrict,
[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:56.160]   as Social Security and Medicare,
[00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:58.320]   especially and Medicaid as well,
[00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:00.880]   but that's less applicable necessarily to older people,
[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:03.680]   but as Social Security and Medicare over time,
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:08.400]   demographically and just from the sheer force of numbers,
[00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:10.320]   especially demographic numbers,
[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:12.560]   as those programs constrict,
[00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:17.360]   it's not possible for the average retiree
[00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:18.880]   to be able to retire.
[00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:21.040]   And so this trend is gonna continue.
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:22.800]   So I actually prefer the Asian model
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:24.640]   or that's where I've seen it the most,
[00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:26.640]   but who knows, maybe it's also Latin American.
[00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:28.400]   I don't know what culture is all.
[00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:30.320]   It seems like every culture that I've been in
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:32.240]   except the US American culture.
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:36.640]   But I like the idea of invest in your kids
[00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:39.120]   and then have your kids support you in your old age.
[00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:43.680]   Frankly, I can't figure out why 70-year-old parents
[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:45.040]   don't wanna live with their kids.
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:47.840]   Now, maybe I'll feel that way when I'm 70 myself
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:49.760]   and I'm like, "I don't wanna ever wanna see my kids again.
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:52.080]   "I'll go see them once a year in the motor home,"
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:53.200]   type of thing.
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:54.560]   But I personally have a,
[00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:56.560]   I think it's ideal for families to live together.
[00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:00.880]   But getting off of that,
[00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:04.720]   I mean, the point is that I've never found a US American,
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:07.040]   really, who's willing to purchase
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:09.120]   a big life insurance policies on their kids' lives.
[00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:11.760]   Because of the fact that they've invested $150,000
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:14.240]   in raising a child and the fact that
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:16.480]   they're gonna need to be cared for
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:21.520]   if their child dies prematurely.
[00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:23.360]   Now, I think it's a perfectly rational
[00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:24.640]   economic model myself.
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:27.440]   And I think it makes a lot of sense,
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:31.520]   but I've never gotten many people to buy that.
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:35.280]   So I'll cover exactly how to fund these models in a minute.
[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:37.520]   But that is the first one that I've seen.
[00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:40.400]   The second primary philosophy that I've seen
[00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:42.320]   espoused in financial literature
[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:44.960]   is the idea that you need to have
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:47.680]   some small or minimal amount of life insurance,
[00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:51.120]   which is adequate to cover funeral costs.
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:52.480]   This is what you read primarily
[00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:54.960]   in mainstream financial publications.
[00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:58.400]   And this one is interesting to me
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:02.320]   because although I think it's logical
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:04.400]   and I think it's well-meaning,
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:10.400]   I think it's mostly irrelevant for most people.
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:13.680]   It's a good example of where general advice
[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:15.360]   just doesn't cut it, in my opinion.
[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:17.680]   Because if you're wealthy,
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:21.120]   to define wealthy, let's just say
[00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:23.200]   middle-class, mass affluent, or up.
[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:26.400]   If you're wealthy, you can simply afford
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:29.760]   to pay for the funeral if your child dies.
[00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:31.600]   Funerals are not that expensive
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:33.040]   unless you go all out with it.
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:36.080]   And even if you do go all out,
[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:37.520]   you can certainly finance it.
[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:39.200]   You can certainly have emergency funds
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:40.080]   and cash reserves.
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:42.240]   You can pool the money from other places
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:44.000]   and you can cash flow it over
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.320]   just a series of payments over time.
[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:50.720]   So if the idea is purchase a minimal amount
[00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:52.080]   of life insurance, which is sufficient
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:53.360]   to cover the funeral cost,
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:56.960]   well, in this case, given the low probability
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:00.000]   of it happening, I don't think it's a big deal
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.840]   for wealthy people because if it does happen,
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:03.920]   you can just self-insure it easily.
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:05.600]   Remember our little model of insurance
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:07.200]   which we've talked about in the past?
[00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:11.600]   It was actually episode 91 where I gave you
[00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:14.160]   a model of figuring out do I actually need insurance?
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:15.200]   So you can find that show
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:17.600]   at radicalpersonalfinance.com/91.
[00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:20.640]   So in this model that I gave you,
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:23.760]   where I said we look at risk factors
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:29.600]   on a scale of how severe is the expected loss
[00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:32.640]   and then how frequent is the expected loss.
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:38.160]   And for risks that have a low expected frequency
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:40.800]   and a low expected severity,
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:42.400]   we would just simply retain that risk.
[00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:45.040]   And so the risk of a child dying,
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:48.480]   it's very infrequent, extremely infrequent,
[00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:50.000]   statistically speaking.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.480]   And in the case of a mass affluent
[00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:55.120]   or the middle class and above person,
[00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:56.880]   it's a relatively low severity
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:58.320]   from a financial planning perspective
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:24:59.280]   to pay for the funeral.
[00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:02.160]   So we would just simply retain that risk
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:06.320]   and self-fund it essentially
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:08.480]   with a general savings fund.
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:10.160]   Now the flip side of this is
[00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:11.680]   let's say that you're not wealthy.
[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:14.000]   You're not in a situation
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.720]   where you're not middle class and above.
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:19.840]   You're poor or just getting started or struggling.
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:22.160]   Well, in this situation, I look at that and I say,
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:23.840]   is that actually going to be
[00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:25.360]   my primary bit of financial advice
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:26.400]   for someone who's struggling
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:28.720]   that they should focus on taking care
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:31.280]   of the risk if their child dies?
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:32.320]   I would probably just run,
[00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:34.640]   I would just keep that risk even so
[00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:36.720]   and deal with it if it happened
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:40.240]   because the expected frequency,
[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:44.000]   the statistical potential of it is so low.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.840]   And there are so many other things
[00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:47.440]   screaming for those dollars.
[00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:53.600]   It would seem like a not very high priority idea for me.
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:26:00.480]   So also if somebody is poor or struggling financially,
[00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:02.000]   then the question is always,
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.480]   are they going to be able to keep the policy in force?
[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:06.240]   Are they going to be able to fund the premiums?
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:09.760]   And that's a real challenge.
[00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:10.800]   So this is one of those things
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:12.960]   where mainstream financial advice,
[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:15.040]   I read it and I say, that's a good idea,
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:17.920]   but the middle class and rich don't need it
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:20.480]   and the lower class probably can't afford it
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:23.360]   and there are other priorities higher in importance.
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:26.720]   So it makes sense on the surface,
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:27.840]   but doesn't make sense to me.
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:29.840]   Just as an advice, that's just Joshua's opinion.
[00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:34.240]   Now on that, remember that funeral costs
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:35.280]   are only part of the cost
[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:37.920]   and I'll come back to that in a minute,
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:39.760]   but this is what's often forgotten
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:41.920]   is that the actual cost of paying for a funeral
[00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:44.320]   is probably not that high,
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:47.360]   but that there may be other associated costs,
[00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:49.200]   especially medical bills.
[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:51.840]   And this is one of those things that really hurts people.
[00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:52.960]   This is another reason why I say,
[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:56.000]   can the poor middle class keep the policy in force?
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.960]   Because what often, if for example,
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:00.960]   if a child is sick and dies
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:02.640]   at the end of an extended illness,
[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:04.480]   then in this scenario,
[00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:08.720]   a lot of times the money's been exhausted previously
[00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:09.920]   and there are many, many bills
[00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:11.440]   and that's when the insurance is most needed
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:12.880]   and it's hard to afford.
[00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:14.000]   So I'll come back to that in a minute.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.520]   So that's the second one.
[00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:17.760]   So philosophy one was you invest heavily in your kids,
[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:19.360]   buy a lot of life insurance on them.
[00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:21.040]   Philosophy two is you need some insurance
[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:22.320]   just to cover funeral costs.
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:26.080]   Or my philosophy, my preferred philosophy
[00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:26.880]   is actually number three,
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:30.160]   which is essentially you probably need some life insurance
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:31.280]   if you can afford it.
[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:32.320]   And the cool thing is,
[00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:34.480]   is that you can cover the life insurance now
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:36.160]   and more importantly,
[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:39.680]   you can help your child with establishment in the future.
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:43.440]   And this is the approach that has made the most sense to me.
[00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:47.760]   It's what I've chosen to do for my son.
[00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:51.120]   And it makes sense to me
[00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:54.720]   because it allows me to think in a couple of ways
[00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:55.440]   and I'll explain it.
[00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:56.480]   But one of the ways,
[00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:58.240]   one of the unique things that you can do
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:27:59.760]   with insurance for kids
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:01.200]   is you can add a couple of options.
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:03.280]   And one of the more important riders
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:04.960]   that you would add onto an insurance policy
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:08.720]   is called an additional purchase benefit rider.
[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:10.960]   And that additional purchase benefit
[00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:15.040]   allows the child to purchase additional amounts of insurance
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:15.760]   in the future
[00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:23.200]   with no additional underwriting requirements.
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:24.800]   So no medical exams.
[00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:26.880]   And this can be extremely helpful
[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:30.400]   both from the physical perspective
[00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:32.480]   but also more importantly in my mind,
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:34.000]   some of the occupational things
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.920]   that can affect life insurance underwriting.
[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:38.320]   One of the keys is when,
[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:42.160]   so I bought my son's insurance policy for him.
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:44.240]   Now, granted I was a life insurance agent
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:46.240]   so I probably was more motivated to do this than most people.
[00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:49.360]   But I bought it for him when he was I think two weeks old
[00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:51.920]   and I think that was the requirement,
[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:52.880]   if my memory is correct,
[00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:54.880]   something like child has to be 15 days old
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:56.960]   before they can qualify for the insurance policy.
[00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:00.080]   But when you buy one,
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:01.760]   buy a policy for a child at that age,
[00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:05.200]   hopefully the child doesn't have any health risks.
[00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:07.200]   Hopefully they haven't started smoking.
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:11.840]   Hopefully they haven't indulged in recreational drug use
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:14.080]   or something that's gonna affect their insurance
[00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:15.120]   medical underwriting.
[00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:17.200]   And hopefully they haven't started
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:21.520]   riding bulls for a hobby or flying airplanes yet.
[00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:23.760]   So you can purchase that insurance for them.
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:25.200]   And then on my son's policy
[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:27.920]   is almost a half a million dollars of additional purchases,
[00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:31.040]   amounts that will be offered to him at regular intervals
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:33.280]   between the ages of 20 and 40.
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:37.600]   So his policy can go from a small token policy now
[00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:40.240]   to a fairly hefty life insurance policy
[00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:41.600]   over that course of time.
[00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:44.960]   And this was actually the big reason why I did it.
[00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:49.360]   Yes, I do value having the life insurance policy
[00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:52.240]   in effect for him if he dies.
[00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:53.920]   That would be important
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:56.640]   because if he were to die prematurely,
[00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:59.200]   then it would allow my wife and I
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:01.280]   some breathing room, some time just to step back
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:05.360]   from whatever employment or business pursuits
[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:08.480]   that we were under to take time to heal
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:09.920]   and to grieve and to recover.
[00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:12.400]   But it's also just,
[00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:16.480]   yes, for my son, it's a whole life insurance policy,
[00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:18.160]   which I'll cover in just a moment
[00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:21.360]   because this is one of the other major areas of controversy
[00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:24.800]   with what type of insurance do you get for your child.
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:27.760]   But my son's is a whole life policy.
[00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:28.960]   And yes, the cash value, yeah,
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:31.280]   theoretically it might be something,
[00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:33.760]   but that wasn't the primary motivator for me in doing it.
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:36.400]   The big motivator was to lock in a policy
[00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:38.800]   in the insurance industry.
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:39.920]   We have this horrible lingo
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:41.600]   is called to protect your insurability,
[00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:44.240]   which nobody outside of the insurance industry
[00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:45.520]   ever says anything like that.
[00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:47.520]   But insurance agent like to spout that all the time.
[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:49.040]   We've got to protect your insurability,
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:50.640]   which means we would make sure
[00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:53.200]   that you don't need to pass a medical exam in the future.
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:55.920]   And again, this may be super helpful.
[00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:58.640]   Let's say that he has something like asthma
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:00.400]   or develops autism
[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:04.960]   or develops some other heart condition, lung condition.
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:06.480]   He can't get any life insurance,
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:10.160]   but then he starts a family and he needs life insurance.
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:11.920]   Well, at least with the policy that he has now,
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:14.160]   then he's protected
[00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:16.640]   and he's able to get additional amounts of life insurance
[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:19.600]   to cover his financial needs and financial goals.
[00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:21.760]   And then I mentioned it already,
[00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:23.120]   but just to stress it,
[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:24.240]   the health stuff is one side,
[00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:28.400]   but then there's also the occupation and avocation.
[00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:30.800]   So occupation, he goes and becomes
[00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:35.280]   a deep sea underwater welder on oil rigs in the North Sea,
[00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:37.520]   probably a fairly dangerous occupation.
[00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:39.840]   I'm not sure how the insurance company is going to view that.
[00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:42.400]   Or he goes and becomes a NASCAR driver.
[00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:44.960]   They're not writing life insurance policies on his life
[00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:46.320]   in that scenario,
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:47.440]   but he's got the policy.
[00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:49.440]   At least he can continue to get some insurance
[00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:52.400]   regardless of his occupation or hobbies.
[00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:54.560]   The day you sign up for flying lessons,
[00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:57.200]   your life insurance rates drastically increase.
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:58.320]   It's absurd.
[00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:01.520]   So by having that in advance, he has some protection.
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:06.560]   Those are the three primary categories that I think of.
[00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:08.720]   And you've got to just pick kind of what makes sense to you.
[00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:12.560]   Most people, now there are other categories.
[00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:14.000]   So other categories would be,
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.440]   are we going to set aside large amounts of money
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:21.520]   in cash value life insurance contracts for tax avoidance?
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:24.720]   Are we going to hold life insurance contracts in a trust
[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:27.200]   as part of our trust tax planning?
[00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:29.680]   Are we going to set aside insurance contracts
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:30.880]   outside of an estate
[00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:33.040]   for generational estate planning purposes?
[00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:34.800]   Those are all applicable,
[00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:36.080]   but they're a bit esoteric
[00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:38.080]   and they're not really of interest to the,
[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:41.040]   they're not applicable to the normal person.
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:42.480]   So let's just set them aside for a moment.
[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:44.160]   Let's just deal with those three things.
[00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:46.000]   Those are my little three categories
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.040]   of how I think of them.
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:51.040]   So need lots of insurance,
[00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:53.280]   need just a little bit of insurance to cover,
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:54.640]   and yeah, need some insurance,
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:56.400]   but we're also doing it for other purposes.
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:33:00.560]   Incidentally, if you have difficulty
[00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:02.960]   with the topic of owning life insurance on your kid's life,
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:05.520]   or if you're a financial planner,
[00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:08.560]   talking with people about this topic,
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:12.560]   then one thing you might consider doing
[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:15.840]   is think about it as a legacy fund.
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:19.040]   And with a legacy fund,
[00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:23.280]   personally, I'm okay with the idea of loaning life insurance,
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:24.080]   but lots of people aren't.
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:25.760]   And so if you can just think of it as,
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:27.280]   instead of how would I benefit
[00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:29.520]   or how would I profit from my child's death,
[00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:32.080]   think what would, if my child died prematurely,
[00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:33.520]   what would I want their legacy to be?
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:37.040]   And I'll give you two examples that I've heard of.
[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:38.960]   Years ago, I heard a talk,
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:40.960]   it was actually a Northwestern mutual agent
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:44.800]   from the company I formerly represented.
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:48.400]   And that agent was talking about the fact
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:50.560]   that he'd been a life insurance agent for a while.
[00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:53.920]   And then tragically, the first life insurance contract
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:57.200]   that he had put in force,
[00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:00.080]   that he actually received payment from,
[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:03.680]   was actually his own child's.
[00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:06.000]   And one of his sons,
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.760]   tragically had been on his way back to college,
[00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:09.920]   had been involved in a car accident
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:16.240]   and was rear-ended by a semi-truck and had died.
[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:17.760]   And so the first death benefit,
[00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:20.880]   death claim that he ever filed for a policy he had written
[00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:22.320]   was on his own sons.
[00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:25.120]   Well, he used that money as seed money.
[00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:27.200]   And I believe he started a foundation,
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:28.960]   something like the Truck Safety Coalition
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:30.160]   or something like that,
[00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:32.400]   where they were involved in lobbying
[00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:39.120]   for greater laws and ideas and regulations
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:43.440]   on the over-the-road trucking association industry.
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:48.160]   And so he used that to establish a foundation,
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:51.520]   and that was in honor of his son.
[00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:52.880]   Another one I remember recently
[00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:55.520]   is I recently heard a presentation
[00:34:55.520 --> 00:35:00.240]   by the sister of a young lady named Dori Slosburg.
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:01.840]   And there's a foundation here in Florida
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:03.760]   called the Dori Slosburg Foundation
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:08.560]   that's also involved in traffic safety issues.
[00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:11.040]   And Dori Slosburg was a young lady.
[00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:14.000]   She died as a teenager in a traffic accident.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:19.680]   And her father and her family established a foundation
[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:21.920]   and have made a lot of progress
[00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:25.760]   in promoting their agenda of greater traffic safety ideas.
[00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:26.640]   And they did it.
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:28.720]   They didn't have anything to fund it with,
[00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:30.960]   but they started with just simply their own money.
[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:33.360]   My point is sometimes if things like that happen,
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:35.040]   wouldn't it be a blessing
[00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:37.040]   if there were a life insurance policy
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:39.600]   that could actually pay out money for...
[00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:43.840]   that could actually pay out money to help in that scenario?
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:46.720]   Hopefully that's helpful to you.
[00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:48.880]   Now, how do you actually buy the policy?
[00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:51.040]   Now, this is another one of those things
[00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:52.400]   where the tough part is the advice
[00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:54.160]   doesn't seem to match up to real life.
[00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:56.480]   One of the best examples of this
[00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:59.760]   is advice on buying term life insurance.
[00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:02.240]   I've read several essays from people,
[00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:03.920]   very well-meaning,
[00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:06.000]   and their advice was
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.680]   buy level term life insurance policy for your minor child
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:13.200]   and buy a large life insurance policy.
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:14.960]   Now, I've looked and I've looked and I've looked.
[00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:17.040]   I've never been able to find a life insurance company
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:21.120]   that will actually sell a standalone term life insurance policy
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:23.040]   for a minor child under the age of 18.
[00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:25.360]   If you know of one, let me know.
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:26.880]   Comment on today's show notes,
[00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:31.040]   radicalpersonalfinance.com/132 for today's show.
[00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:32.160]   I would love to know about them,
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:34.160]   but I've never been able to find one.
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:36.800]   And I do actually understand
[00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:38.880]   from the insurance company's perspective
[00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:41.760]   why they wouldn't desire to offer one.
[00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:45.360]   But it's funny, I've read that advice in written essays
[00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:48.000]   and I've never been able to find a company
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.360]   that would offer that kind of policy.
[00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:53.120]   Term life insurance is generally not sold to minors.
[00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:57.280]   If you want, if your child is 18 and over,
[00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:01.920]   it's simple, I've done this for some parents actually
[00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:04.240]   who when their child is going to college,
[00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:06.160]   they're getting ready to write a very large check
[00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:07.280]   for college tuition.
[00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:11.920]   And they go ahead and put a larger term life insurance policy
[00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:13.840]   in force on their child's life.
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:17.520]   And if you're gonna write a check for $50,000 a year
[00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:19.040]   of private school tuition,
[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:22.320]   buy a life insurance policy for $250,000
[00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:25.200]   a term life insurance for an 18 year old
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:27.680]   would be under 20 bucks a month.
[00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:30.880]   So buy a term life insurance policy
[00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:34.320]   and cover yourself and cover them.
[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:37.840]   If your child is under 18, make sure,
[00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:40.080]   or excuse me, over 18 on that scenario,
[00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:42.080]   make sure it's an annual renewable
[00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:43.440]   term life insurance policy.
[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:46.000]   Pay for it for a few years and then transfer it to them
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.320]   if they want it or drop it if you don't need it anymore.
[00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:50.000]   But make sure it's annual renewable term
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:50.960]   instead of level term
[00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:52.880]   so you have more flexibility.
[00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:54.720]   If your child's under 18 then
[00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:57.120]   and you need a lot of life insurance policy on their,
[00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:59.200]   a lot of life insurance coverage on their life,
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:02.400]   you're not gonna be able to do it with term life.
[00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:04.560]   The closest that I've been able to figure out
[00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:07.440]   that you can get to it would be to do some sort
[00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:10.160]   of stripped out universal life insurance policy.
[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:12.480]   So you could take a universal life policy,
[00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:14.880]   fund it minimally so that you're essentially
[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:18.160]   buying term protection with very little cash accumulation
[00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:20.880]   and the policy will expire at an earlier age.
[00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:22.720]   That can get you pretty close
[00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:25.680]   and you might be able to get one of those in force.
[00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:27.200]   Or if you have the cash flow,
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:29.760]   you can go and set up a traditional
[00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:31.360]   whole life policy of some kind.
[00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:35.440]   I personally have a bias toward being conservative here.
[00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:41.600]   Me as an agent, I will usually lean in the direction
[00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:43.280]   of a more conservative approach,
[00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:46.800]   a whole life policy, a life paid up at 65,
[00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:47.760]   something like that.
[00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:50.160]   Where there's plenty of cash to keep the policy going.
[00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:55.200]   And I would look with hard, I'd be slow.
[00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:58.640]   If you're struggling with the cash flow,
[00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:03.360]   it's probably not the right fit for you in my opinion.
[00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:05.840]   It's just probably not.
[00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:08.000]   So I tend to be conservative
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.600]   'cause I don't want the policy to fall apart
[00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:11.280]   at an inopportune time.
[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:13.840]   So do your aggressive investing
[00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:15.520]   with another financial instrument
[00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:17.920]   and stick to, I like to be conservative with insurance
[00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:18.560]   is my bias.
[00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:20.320]   Shop carefully.
[00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:21.680]   You don't wanna make a mistake here.
[00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:23.760]   You wanna make sure that you have a policy
[00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:26.240]   that your child will love owning in a few decades time
[00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:27.680]   when you transfer it to them.
[00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:29.680]   Not something they're gonna wake up owning at 30
[00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:33.120]   and just be ticked off that mom and dad
[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:34.080]   threw their money away
[00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:37.280]   into a poorly designed insurance contract for many years.
[00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:39.520]   So make sure the policy is well designed.
[00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:43.440]   Make sure that the fees are low, the expenses are low.
[00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:46.640]   I'm personally, I'm biased in favor
[00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:49.200]   of a mutual insurance company
[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:50.560]   instead of a stock insurance company
[00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:53.440]   to remove the percentage of returns
[00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:55.120]   that goes to the owners of the company
[00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:57.120]   and get it back into the insurance contract.
[00:39:57.120 --> 00:40:00.480]   So I'm also, again, biased in favor
[00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:01.840]   of a conservative policy
[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:04.320]   instead of an aggressive equity-based approach.
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:06.160]   Although I could actually argue for those as well.
[00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:09.120]   And then also if you're gonna get big insurance policies
[00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:10.960]   for yourself, excuse me, for your kids,
[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:13.520]   you better have big insurance policies on yourself.
[00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:15.520]   So if you're wondering,
[00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:18.400]   you can't go and buy a million dollar life insurance policy
[00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:21.120]   on your 10 year old son or daughter's life
[00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:23.760]   if you don't have 10 or $20 million of coverage
[00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:26.240]   in force on you.
[00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:28.080]   And it's all done based upon the ratio.
[00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:32.000]   So that would be how I would handle it for number one,
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.800]   if you're trying to get a big insurance policy
[00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:37.600]   to protect your, essentially your investment in your child.
[00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:40.960]   Number two, if you're just trying to cover yourself
[00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:42.400]   for a burial policy
[00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:44.640]   and you just want something that's the minimum,
[00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:48.400]   here are the best route is just to simply get a term rider.
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:51.280]   And you can get this in a few different ways.
[00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:52.720]   I've never been able to find, like I said,
[00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:54.400]   a standalone term product,
[00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:56.160]   but you can easily get a term rider
[00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:57.440]   in a number of different ways.
[00:40:57.440 --> 00:40:59.360]   Start with your group benefits at work.
[00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:01.040]   That's usually gonna be the cheapest way
[00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:02.160]   and the simplest way.
[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:04.800]   So you add on 5,000 bucks for each of your kids
[00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:06.400]   and it costs you 72 cents a month.
[00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:08.400]   Start with that.
[00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:11.760]   Number two is look,
[00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:14.240]   if you don't have anything, your group benefits,
[00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:16.400]   look for things like your auto coverage,
[00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:18.880]   your property and casualty.
[00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:21.280]   Maybe there might be some benefit that's available to you
[00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:22.960]   as a simple add on there.
[00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:25.200]   Banks sometimes offer this thing.
[00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:26.800]   I've seen advertisements for it.
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:28.640]   And then look at your personal term insurance.
[00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:32.400]   If you have life insurance, term life insurance yourself,
[00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:34.640]   look to see if your company offers a rider.
[00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:35.680]   Some do, some don't.
[00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:37.520]   Some policies do, some policies don't.
[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:41.840]   You have to look at each individual situation,
[00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:43.200]   but a lot of the companies that do,
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:45.200]   I don't like them 'cause they're kind of gimmicky about it.
[00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:46.800]   They try to do the family coverage thing
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:47.840]   to sell more insurance.
[00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:51.440]   But maybe you're already in that situation
[00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:53.120]   and you have that option.
[00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:54.720]   Number three, a balanced approach.
[00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:57.040]   It's like, again, this is what I've done for my son.
[00:41:57.040 --> 00:41:59.040]   It's a relatively small whole life policy.
[00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:02.640]   For him, it's 25,000 bucks of whole life insurance.
[00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:05.520]   It's well-designed, carefully designed with low expenses
[00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:06.800]   and high cash and credit.
[00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:08.080]   And high cash accumulation.
[00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:11.920]   So that way, I just want it to always be around.
[00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:15.360]   It's possible that this policy could just simply be
[00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:18.320]   his permanent burial policy that he always keeps around
[00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:19.600]   for the rest of his life.
[00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:21.520]   And it's just purely intended to provide
[00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:23.200]   some cash liquidity at death.
[00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:28.160]   I'm not saying, by the way, one of the needs that I learned
[00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:30.640]   that I never appreciated until I actually went through it
[00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:33.360]   with a client was the value of having
[00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:36.480]   some sort of life insurance policy available.
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:37.600]   At death.
[00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:39.440]   Even if you don't necessarily need it,
[00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:41.200]   because you can afford to die and you can afford
[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:42.320]   to pay for your funeral.
[00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:48.160]   I had a unique experience with a client who was retired.
[00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:52.160]   They were in their 80s.
[00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:53.840]   And they were retired.
[00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:56.400]   They were multimillionaires.
[00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:58.560]   Not multi-multi, but multiple millions.
[00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:04.080]   And my client, the wife, died unexpectedly.
[00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:07.680]   And it was very interesting to go through,
[00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:12.320]   because at this time in their financial life,
[00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:14.880]   they had several homes that they were trying to sell
[00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:17.600]   that were on the market, but with a slow--
[00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:18.800]   this was a couple of years ago--
[00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:21.200]   with slow-moving real estate market.
[00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:22.560]   They weren't selling quickly.
[00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:26.320]   And they had some assets locked up in a trust
[00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:28.240]   and some illiquid trust assets.
[00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:31.840]   So the interesting thing was, even though this client
[00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:34.400]   was a multimillionaire, it was stressful
[00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:39.040]   to them to handle the final expenses.
[00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:42.000]   And as I remember, it was something--
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.720]   somewhere between $50,000 and $100,000
[00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:48.320]   of life insurance that was there.
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:51.360]   And it was such a blessing to this client to get that check.
[00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:53.760]   It was about $80,000.
[00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:55.120]   And it was such a blessing for this client
[00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:57.440]   to receive the check for $80,000,
[00:43:57.440 --> 00:43:58.560]   because what it allowed him--
[00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:00.160]   knowing that that was in force--
[00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:02.640]   it allowed him to provide for the type of funeral
[00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:04.240]   that he wanted to provide for his wife.
[00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:07.920]   Without being concerned about the expense up front.
[00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:09.600]   And so it was interesting.
[00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:12.160]   I never imagined that a multimillionaire would--
[00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:16.240]   I'd always been generally in disfavor of the idea
[00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:19.280]   of having burial policies that are whole life policies
[00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:22.000]   that are going to be around as burial policies.
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:22.880]   Never made sense to me.
[00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:24.720]   I thought, if you've got money, just take some money
[00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:26.000]   from stock and move it.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:27.920]   But it really opened my eyes to something
[00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:30.400]   that I had been previously blind to.
[00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:32.560]   So for my son, maybe it'll just be around
[00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:36.080]   for his own burial down the road.
[00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:36.720]   I don't know.
[00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:40.000]   At an old age, I'll transfer it to him at some point.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:43.040]   The policy will probably quick pay in his 20s,
[00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:44.800]   depending on interest rates.
[00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:46.880]   So quick pay, meaning that I won't
[00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:48.720]   have to pay any more premiums on it
[00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:49.920]   from when it's in his 20s.
[00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:52.560]   It won't have a ton of money, because I don't put much money
[00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:52.880]   into it.
[00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:55.440]   I think it's less than $20 a month that I put into it.
[00:44:55.440 --> 00:45:00.560]   And for me, the insurance is simply nice to have, in my mind.
[00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:03.120]   If he died, I'd arrange for cheap burial arrangements
[00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:04.400]   and pay cash.
[00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:07.760]   And I have the insurance, but I don't need it for that.
[00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:10.720]   Just pay cash for the funeral or finance it.
[00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:12.720]   I don't know, get a 0% credit card or something.
[00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:16.880]   But also, the big reason I like having it
[00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:19.680]   is from the perspective of if there were things
[00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:20.640]   like medical costs.
[00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:24.320]   These can be very substantial.
[00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:26.000]   I've seen this with a few different people
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:26.800]   that are close to me.
[00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:29.440]   Also, the key benefit I mentioned
[00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:31.680]   is that APB and the waiver of premium.
[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:36.160]   And so since I've watched people close to me
[00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:39.520]   go through things like muscular disease--
[00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:41.920]   I had a friend who died from muscular dystrophy.
[00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:46.160]   And watching a family go through that process
[00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:49.120]   and the child eventually dying, but then
[00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:52.320]   knowing the medical costs outstanding,
[00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:54.240]   really would have been a benefit.
[00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:58.080]   And I have always liked to put on life insurance
[00:45:58.080 --> 00:45:59.840]   policies for children.
[00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:02.880]   The APB option, the additional purchase benefit option
[00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:05.840]   I explained, and also a waiver of premium option,
[00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:13.280]   which is the scenario where if he were to become disabled,
[00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:15.360]   then the insurance company pays the premiums.
[00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:17.920]   And what's beneficial formally with the company
[00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:23.920]   that his insurance is with is if he were disabled,
[00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:24.640]   they would still--
[00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:26.480]   the insurance company would still exercise
[00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:28.160]   all of those additional purchases.
[00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:33.840]   And they would pay for the additional increases
[00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:35.040]   in the policy.
[00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:37.040]   And that can be a substantial amount of money.
[00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:39.040]   Personally, I have little need of the policy
[00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:40.240]   from an investing perspective.
[00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:41.680]   It's too small to be substantial.
[00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:45.600]   And then the growth in whole life insurance policies
[00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:48.000]   for kids is just simply too slow up front
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:49.840]   to really matter in their life.
[00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:52.960]   I've never been able to make one work at all,
[00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:54.800]   the numbers to work at all, for any kind
[00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:56.000]   of short-term financial needs.
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.320]   Too conservative to make any big difference.
[00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:02.000]   And my tax rate at the moment is too low for me to need it
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.240]   to protect from kiddie tax or any of that stuff.
[00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:05.120]   I don't have it in a trust.
[00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:06.880]   So it's pure savings and protection.
[00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:08.800]   I'll focus on other investing ideas.
[00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:09.600]   Then I'll come back.
[00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:11.760]   And maybe later on down the road, I'll think about buying
[00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:12.480]   more life insurance.
[00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:14.400]   But it's certainly not something that's needed right now.
[00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:18.080]   So those are my thoughts on life insurance for kids.
[00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:21.040]   Sean, I hope that's helpful for you as kind of an intro.
[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:24.320]   Probably told you some terms there
[00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:26.960]   that might not have made sense.
[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:30.240]   But hopefully that helped you.
[00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:35.120]   So I've just made a split-second decision.
[00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:38.080]   I'm going to change the course of today's show.
[00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:40.080]   It's-- we're at 47 minutes into the episode,
[00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:41.200]   and I've answered one question.
[00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:45.120]   So I need to get a little bit of room
[00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:46.240]   to catch up this week.
[00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:48.320]   So what I'm going to do is I'm ready to answer
[00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:51.040]   these next five questions on my list.
[00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:53.840]   I'm going to answer the next one now in today's show.
[00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:54.960]   And then I'm going to split this out.
[00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:58.080]   And we're going to do a Q&A show each day this week.
[00:47:58.080 --> 00:48:00.240]   And that will help me to get ahead a little bit
[00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:01.840]   with the content.
[00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:04.480]   I've got some pretty big shows that I've been--
[00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:06.640]   was working last week on getting out.
[00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:09.600]   I've got a big-- some big shows planned on 529s,
[00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:13.840]   some stuff on investing, health savings accounts.
[00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:16.320]   So I need to put some prep time into those.
[00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:17.600]   So I'm going to do these Q&A shows.
[00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:19.920]   We're going to split this out into five shows.
[00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:22.080]   And then episodes may be a little bit shorter,
[00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:23.280]   but that will help me.
[00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:25.280]   So let's just take one more question here today.
[00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:27.040]   And then we will wrap up for the day.
[00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:29.600]   And so this next question comes from Chris.
[00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:30.800]   And here we go.
[00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:31.520]   Hi, Joshua.
[00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:32.240]   This is Chris.
[00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:34.880]   This is a long way off for me.
[00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:40.160]   But if I turn 50 and my wife and I have a few million dollars
[00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:42.560]   tied up in retirement accounts, can we
[00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:48.640]   start withdrawals on a 72(t) basis at that point
[00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:53.440]   and then cancel them or otherwise change it
[00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:55.120]   when we hit 59 and 1/2?
[00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:57.840]   I'm pretty sure that we can, but I
[00:48:57.840 --> 00:48:59.840]   can't seem to find a lot of details about that.
[00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:03.760]   Anyway, I freaking love your podcast.
[00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:04.480]   It's awesome.
[00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:05.200]   It's informative.
[00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:07.920]   It's just-- it's kick ass.
[00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:10.480]   Anyway, thanks a lot.
[00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:10.980]   Bye.
[00:49:10.980 --> 00:49:12.720]   Chris, thanks so much.
[00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:15.280]   And so this one's going to be my shortest answer of the--
[00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:17.760]   well, it's going to be the night.
[00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:18.640]   Now it's going to be the week.
[00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:21.680]   Yes, you can do that.
[00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:23.440]   And that can work fine.
[00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:28.960]   For the early retirement space, if you've got loads of money
[00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:33.280]   and you can retire at 50, this can work great.
[00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:36.000]   So the reason I poo-poo the strategy for most people
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:40.240]   is most people don't have enough money that they can survive
[00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:42.480]   on the relatively low rates of withdrawal
[00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:45.840]   that you can get under a 72(t).
[00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:46.880]   So let me explain.
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:53.120]   This is essentially the rule where you can pull money out
[00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:54.160]   of an account early.
[00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:56.960]   And as long as you take it out in a series of substantially
[00:49:56.960 --> 00:50:03.280]   equal periodic payments, then you can avoid the 10% early
[00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:04.320]   withdrawal tax.
[00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:07.680]   So Chris, in your numbers, let's just say I put in somebody
[00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:11.360]   that is an account balance of $3 million in retirement
[00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:12.240]   accounts.
[00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:15.360]   And you're going to retire at the age of 50
[00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:18.160]   with a 45-year-old beneficiary.
[00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:20.560]   I tossed this into a 72(t) calculator.
[00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:22.640]   I'm using the Dinkytown one here.
[00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:24.640]   And the reasonable interest rate is 2.1%
[00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:27.040]   under those assessments.
[00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:29.760]   Then you can see that the amounts of money that you would
[00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:33.920]   be getting out, let's just say at 2.1%,
[00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:37.520]   the required minimum distribution would be $88,000
[00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:40.880]   for the required minimum distribution method.
[00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:46.000]   The fixed amortization method would be $123,838 per month.
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:47.840]   So you'd be in good shape.
[00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:49.600]   And that would work fine for you.
[00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:53.440]   Now, the secret, as you mentioned, is that when you start
[00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:58.400]   a series of equal periodic payments withdrawal strategy,
[00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:05.280]   you must continue it for at least five years
[00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:10.320]   or until the age of 59 and 1/2, whichever of those is longer.
[00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:13.760]   So if you started at 50, as you asked in your question,
[00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:17.520]   yes, you can go from 50 to 59 and 1/2.
[00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:20.480]   And because that's been at least five years,
[00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:24.560]   and because you're older than 59 and 1/2,
[00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:26.640]   at that point in time, you can indeed change
[00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:28.240]   your distribution strategy.
[00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:29.680]   So it can work fine.
[00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:33.920]   And it's a great strategy for some people to think about
[00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:34.880]   and to plan on it.
[00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:39.920]   It very well could solve that question of how do you
[00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:40.720]   get the money out.
[00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:43.680]   What it doesn't work well for is it doesn't work
[00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:46.640]   for most of the mainstream financial planning clients
[00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:49.120]   that a financial planner will often encounter,
[00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:52.240]   who are from often two schools of thought.
[00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:54.720]   Number one is, Joshua, I don't have enough money
[00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:55.520]   for retirement.
[00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:59.360]   Well, in this case-- and it's early, so can I get money out?
[00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:00.960]   Well, in this case, the amount of money coming out
[00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:03.120]   of the account is insufficient to live on.
[00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:05.600]   It's useful to have as a backup tool,
[00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:08.000]   but it's not a primary tool because there's not
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:09.280]   enough money to live on.
[00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:12.160]   Or this flip side is most people that save $3 million
[00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:17.680]   are not going to be content with $120,000 a year lifestyle.
[00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:21.920]   You have to remember that many people, their goal is to say,
[00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:23.760]   how much can I take out?
[00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:27.600]   So it's not a matter of what's the safe withdrawal rate,
[00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:31.360]   what's the 4%, which would be $120,000 or $3 million.
[00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:34.960]   The question is, how can I push this as aggressively
[00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:35.520]   as possible?
[00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:38.480]   And they want to get out more money out front oftentimes.
[00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:43.760]   So the numbers have to work for this to be effective.
[00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:46.640]   So it's a useful tool to have, but I've--
[00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:47.200]   I don't know.
[00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:49.200]   At least I've not been a planner forever,
[00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:51.760]   but in the six years I was doing it professionally,
[00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:54.400]   I never found the scenario of the client
[00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:57.120]   that it actually worked for.
[00:52:57.120 --> 00:52:58.480]   So that's the answer to your question.
[00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:03.200]   And with that, I think we will skip for today's show.
[00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:03.760]   I'm sorry.
[00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:06.800]   I hope you don't feel bamboozled in the intro
[00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:10.000]   of my telling you we were going to do content
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:10.960]   that we didn't get to.
[00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:14.960]   So tune in tomorrow, and I will answer a question--
[00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:15.440]   you know what?
[00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:16.480]   I'm going to stop the music.
[00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:18.960]   And here's the question that we're going to answer tomorrow.
[00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:21.920]   We're going to have this beautiful question from Melissa
[00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:23.520]   on a very interesting strategy.
[00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:23.520]   - Hi, Joshua.
[00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:26.160]   It's Melissa from Pennsylvania, and I have a question for you.
[00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:30.560]   I keep a money journal where I just jot down ideas and books
[00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:33.200]   and different things as I come across them.
[00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:37.840]   And I was reading through a page that I had jotted down a note
[00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:41.040]   from a year or two ago about paying your house off
[00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:42.000]   with a HELOC loan.
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:45.200]   Essentially, it was-- from what I understand,
[00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:48.800]   it was you deposit-- you create a HELOC.
[00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:51.680]   You deposit your checks into it and pay all your bills
[00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:54.400]   out of the HELOC, almost using it as a savings account,
[00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:56.720]   and in turn, paying off more of your principal
[00:53:56.720 --> 00:53:59.680]   and decreasing the length of your loan.
[00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:05.600]   Basically, I come to you for advice on if that is a legitimate idea,
[00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:08.320]   and also if you have any knowledge of that.
[00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:11.520]   Also, in the page I jotted down, it must be associated
[00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:13.360]   with a book called Master Your Debt
[00:54:13.360 --> 00:54:17.280]   and a website, truthinequity.com.
[00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:19.440]   Any advice you have would be great.
[00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:20.000]   Thanks a lot.
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:22.560]   - So there's my teaser for tomorrow's show.
[00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:24.480]   Some of you are scratching your head and saying, "Huh?"
[00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:27.360]   And others of you say, "Ah, I know what that is."
[00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:29.120]   It is quite fun.
[00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:33.120]   Tomorrow, tune in and I will share that information with you.
[00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:34.080]   It's going to be a good one.
[00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:38.160]   I got the book and I read it, and I will explain it to you
[00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:40.880]   in words you can understand, and I'll tell you my thoughts on it.
[00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:42.160]   So tune in tomorrow.
[00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:43.600]   Thank you all so much for being here.
[00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:46.400]   I appreciate each one of you that is listening.
[00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:47.040]   I really do.
[00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:49.680]   I appreciate each one of you who supports the show.
[00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:50.800]   If you would like to support the show,
[00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:53.040]   if you gain value out of today's show,
[00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:56.000]   I hope it was specific and helpful.
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:58.240]   I would love it if you'd consider joining the membership program.
[00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:00.320]   That is the Irregulars.
[00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:04.880]   You can find all the details on that at radicalpersonalfinance.com/membership
[00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:06.640]   are all the details.
[00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:08.320]   But basically, it's you pay me money,
[00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:11.040]   and I am able to afford to keep doing the show
[00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:13.040]   with the depth that I try to do it with.
[00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:14.160]   That's essentially the deal.
[00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:19.600]   I think as we go out here,
[00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:25.280]   that I will read you one review very quickly here.
[00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:28.880]   In the time that I have.
[00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:41.760]   And Michael says, "Finance geek.
[00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:43.680]   Excellent outlook on achieving financial independence
[00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:44.880]   and getting out of the rat race."
[00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:47.520]   Thank you, Michael, for that review on iTunes.
[00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:48.800]   I appreciate that.
[00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:55.920]   And also, Illiterate, what an interesting name,
[00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:58.960]   says, "Sheets does a fantastic job of removing his personal opinions
[00:55:58.960 --> 00:56:00.480]   and proscriptions from the meat of his show
[00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:02.160]   and fulfills his mission statement
[00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:04.000]   of providing thought-provoking information
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:05.600]   and wide-ranging insights
[00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:07.600]   with examples from both mundane and extreme.
[00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:09.760]   Anybody looking to be a financial planner for themselves
[00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:11.520]   or others should give him a listen."
[00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:15.120]   Thank you to the two of you who left those reviews for me on iTunes.
[00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:16.480]   I appreciate that very much.
[00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:19.520]   Sorry that today was a little bit disjointed.
[00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:24.720]   It'll be better tomorrow, back when my brain is working a little bit more.
[00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:31.920]   We'll be with you tomorrow.
