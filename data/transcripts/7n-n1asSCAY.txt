[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.800]   - Happy Wednesday, everyone.
[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.960]   For a few weeks, we have been looking
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.320]   at a two-part sermon series Pastor John delivered
[00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.360]   in the spring of 2010.
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.480]   And today's episode is the final installment
[00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.360]   of clips from those two messages.
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.560]   Historically, this pair of sermons is really interesting
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.400]   because they come in the days leading up
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.800]   to his eight-month leave of absence,
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.440]   which was time away from the pulpit
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.180]   to work some things out in his own heart
[00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.320]   and in his own family as well.
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.360]   We've talked about this leave,
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.040]   the lessons he took from it,
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.320]   particularly in three episodes in this podcast
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.320]   back in episodes, I think it was APJ 138, 220, and 1227.
[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.140]   And as you know from those episodes,
[00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.600]   if you heard them, it was a defining season for him.
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.500]   The precursor to that leave is these two sermons.
[00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.240]   And they're interesting because in them,
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.200]   Pastor John explains what makes him tick.
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.480]   Why does he do ministry the way he does it?
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.360]   He actually explains this point in these sermons
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.320]   as we saw in APJ 1769.
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.440]   And then we looked at a related theme.
[00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.240]   God makes much of us, he does.
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.540]   He really does make much of us.
[00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.020]   So why does God make so much of us?
[00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.920]   That was APJ 1772.
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.160]   And then we looked at how God makes much of us.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.040]   There's six or seven profound ways
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.440]   in which God makes much of his children.
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.500]   And Pastor John explained that in APJ 1775.
[00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.800]   And that led to last week's conundrum.
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.280]   There we looked at whether or not God ruins his love for us,
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.240]   by loving us for himself and for his own glory.
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.760]   A really key question to answer.
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.400]   And it was answered last time, last Wednesday,
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.880]   in APJ 1778.
[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.000]   And today, we finish this little mini series
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.280]   of sermon clips by looking at how profoundly
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.240]   we are loved by God.
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.560]   Oh, how Pastor John wanted his church to feel
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.040]   the gravity of God's great love to us in Christ,
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.440]   as Paul called it in Ephesians 2, 4.
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.360]   That great love.
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.200]   Here's how Pastor John did it in the following clip
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.200]   from his April 25th, 2010 sermon,
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.840]   as he leaves for eight months.
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.740]   Here he is expounding 1 Corinthians 1, verses 26 to 31.
[00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:16.560]   - In these six verses of 26 to 31 of 1 Corinthians 1,
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.160]   in these six verses, Paul describes at least,
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.040]   depends on how you divide it up,
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.180]   four ways that God loves us.
[00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.320]   Loves you personally.
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.400]   Four ways that he loves you.
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.600]   And by you, let's get this clear now.
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.360]   By you, I don't mean everybody.
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.440]   God doesn't love everybody in the same way.
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.520]   The kinds of love that are described here
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.520]   are for those who have been awakened in their heart
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.080]   to see themselves as desperate sinners
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.720]   in need of a savior and Christ, crucified,
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.720]   has shown for them as their wisdom and their power.
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.660]   And he has become compellingly true and beautiful
[00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.660]   and attractive and valuable and you have received him
[00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.200]   and he is yours and you are his.
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.640]   That's who I'm talking about.
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.340]   I hope the rest of you who aren't in that category
[00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.780]   will be drawn in by this message.
[00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.620]   Okay, that's the way I see things.
[00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.580]   I'm sure not everybody in this room is in that category.
[00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.480]   There's just too many of you and there's lots of people
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.140]   of all different kinds and so my prayer is that
[00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.340]   those of you inside will feel massively loved
[00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.720]   in fresh new ways and those on the outside
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.220]   would become so jealous and envious
[00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.660]   that you would be drawn in.
[00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.700]   What we have in these six verses
[00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.420]   is four ways that he loves us
[00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.420]   and then a double purpose for why he loves us
[00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.140]   this particular way.
[00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.300]   So two things, four ways that he loves us
[00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:07.300]   and a double purpose for why he would love us that way.
[00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.740]   So it's a how question and a why question, got it?
[00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:13.980]   How does he love me?
[00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.620]   Why does he love me this way?
[00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.860]   And the answers to those two questions
[00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:19.420]   are here in this text.
[00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.420]   So let's take it in reverse order.
[00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:22.820]   Let's go to the purposes first.
[00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.060]   A double purpose for why he loves us in these four ways.
[00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.620]   The first half of the double purpose is verse 29.
[00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.780]   So that, you see a so that, you know,
[00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.540]   some kind of result of purpose is coming.
[00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.540]   So that no human being might boast in the presence of God.
[00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.980]   So the purpose of God in loving us in these ways
[00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.220]   is so that we will be loved in a way
[00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.500]   that does not incline us to boast in ourselves,
[00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.620]   in the presence of God.
[00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.060]   That's the purpose of loving us this way.
[00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.260]   So that no human being will put their arms
[00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:00.860]   in their suspenders and say,
[00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.100]   "What a good boy am I in the presence of God."
[00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.220]   He loves us so much,
[00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:14.500]   he will not let us ruin the glorious experience
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.740]   of being loved by turning God's love
[00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.840]   into a reason to boast in ourselves.
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.260]   He loves you too much, he will not let you ruin
[00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.380]   the experience of being loved by God.
[00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.780]   He won't let you ruin it by converting it in our fallen way
[00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.180]   into an experience of boasting
[00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.380]   in the presence of God in ourselves.
[00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.260]   He loves you too much.
[00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.060]   He will not let that happen to you.
[00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:44.380]   He will come at you from every side.
[00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.740]   It's unimaginable to kill that in you.
[00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.660]   So that, what?
[00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:54.460]   Second half of the double purpose is found in verse 31.
[00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:59.380]   "So that, as it is written,
[00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:03.780]   "let everyone who boasts, boast in the Lord."
[00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.000]   So you see the contrast.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.260]   Verse 29, his purpose in loving us this way
[00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.220]   is so that nobody will boast in the presence of the Lord
[00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:15.900]   and the positive way of saying it in verse 31
[00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.700]   is so that the one who boasts, boasts only in the Lord.
[00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.300]   Oh, we're gonna boast in the presence of the Lord all right.
[00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:25.400]   We're gonna brag on God forever and not ourselves.
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:31.820]   We will not boast in our own doing.
[00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:37.100]   If we stand in front of a mirror in heaven
[00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.720]   and like what we see, which I suppose we would
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.140]   if there'd be mirrors, I don't think there'd be
[00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:44.220]   any mirrors in heaven, just an opinion.
[00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:50.780]   If we stood there, we would say, "Praise God!"
[00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:52.020]   That's what we would say.
[00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:59.380]   So there is the double purpose in the text
[00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:02.260]   for the four ways that I'm now gonna show you
[00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:03.580]   that he loves you.
[00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:06.380]   First way, so that you won't boast in yourself
[00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:09.460]   in his presence or putting it positively,
[00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:13.580]   positively, verse 31, so that you will boast in the Lord.
[00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:17.580]   Oh, that this church would be resounding
[00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:22.300]   in hallways and small groups and families
[00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:24.780]   with boasting in the Lord.
[00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:27.980]   Speak well of the Lord.
[00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.180]   Say much about the Lord.
[00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:31.420]   Talk about his deeds.
[00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:33.620]   I just read this morning in my devotions,
[00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:37.620]   you have made me glad by your works.
[00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:40.180]   And I spent about two minutes, I suppose,
[00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:43.460]   just naming them and being glad, sitting on the couch,
[00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:46.700]   just being glad in the works of God.
[00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:51.500]   Name them, exult, boast in God.
[00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:56.320]   Forget about your painful self for a moment.
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:57.980]   It just might get well.
[00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:02.460]   What are the four ways that you are loved in this text?
[00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:03.860]   I'll name them, then we'll look at them.
[00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:05.540]   Number one, God chose you.
[00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:06.660]   He loved you by choosing you.
[00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:08.560]   Number two, he called you.
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:11.120]   Number three, he put you in Christ.
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.380]   Number four, he made Christ your wisdom,
[00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:15.400]   righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:16.240]   That's it.
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:18.580]   Those are the four ways in this text that God loves you.
[00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:20.380]   Let's take them one at a time.
[00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:23.400]   Number one, God loved you by choosing you.
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:28.400]   Verse 27 and 28, God chose what is foolish in the world
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:32.380]   to shame the wise.
[00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:36.460]   God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong.
[00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:40.780]   God chose what is low and despised in the world,
[00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:42.100]   even things that are not,
[00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:44.540]   to bring to nothing things that are.
[00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:47.220]   Very clear, God chose.
[00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:50.180]   If you are Christ, he chose you.
[00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:53.540]   He leaves some unchosen, he chooses others.
[00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:55.540]   If you are in, he chose you.
[00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:58.960]   In fact, if you ask him, when did that happen?
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:04.120]   This word in the Greek for chose
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:06.960]   is only used one other place outside this text.
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:13.400]   Ephesians 1.4, which was the text we looked at last week.
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:17.920]   God chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:22.340]   that we should be holy and blameless before him.
[00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:26.080]   Only that place in Paul does it occur,
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:27.680]   and therefore I take it to mean,
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:29.700]   he chose you, he chose you, he chose you,
[00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:33.880]   in verses 27 and 28, meaning from eternity.
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:41.760]   That's why in Romans 11.5,
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:45.120]   when he uses the noun, not the verb,
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:49.180]   he calls it the election of grace.
[00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:54.160]   Meaning that when God stood in eternity
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:57.560]   and contemplated you, he contemplated you
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:59.900]   as needing saving in Christ.
[00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:02.660]   I get that from verses four through seven of Ephesians,
[00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:04.420]   where we are chosen in Christ.
[00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:08.320]   We don't need to be chosen in Christ if we aren't sinners.
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:11.300]   We need to be chosen in Christ if we need righteousness,
[00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:13.680]   if we need forgiveness and redemption.
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:17.580]   He contemplated, he saw all of us
[00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:19.460]   as unworthy of being chosen.
[00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:24.140]   Nobody is wronged if they're unchosen.
[00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:30.140]   You are just spectacularly blessed
[00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:32.960]   for nothing in yourself.
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:37.960]   This love is absolutely unconditional
[00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:42.780]   without any exception.
[00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:49.560]   So know, oh Holy Spirit,
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:51.080]   if it doesn't happen right now,
[00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:55.040]   let it happen later tonight or later this week,
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:11:00.040]   sooner or later, come and pour this being loved
[00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:02.500]   from eternity.
[00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:05.000]   I don't know about you,
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.040]   but I was really helped by my sermon last week.
[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:11.040]   [audience laughing]
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:17.700]   I've been just sitting around saying,
[00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:21.440]   he chose me in love, he created me in love,
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:24.400]   he sent Jesus in love, he died for me in love,
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.960]   he keeps me in love, he made much of me
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:29.760]   by sitting me on his throne, he made much of me.
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:32.280]   I've just been going all through that,
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:33.960]   just preaching to myself.
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.480]   I need as much help as anybody.
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:39.280]   So I'm preaching the same sermon.
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:44.280]   Number two, God loved you by calling you.
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:48.280]   So first he chose you and now secondly,
[00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:51.200]   God loved you by calling you.
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:56.200]   Verse 26, consider your calling, brothers.
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:00.800]   That's what I'm asking you to do right now.
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.760]   Just do some considering right now.
[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:04.440]   And the first thing I suppose you'd ask is,
[00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:05.720]   what's he talking about?
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:11.640]   My job, carpenter, nurse, teacher, homemaker?
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:14.560]   No, that's not what he's talking about.
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:16.960]   How do you know that's not what he's talking about?
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:22.840]   Well, mainly I know because of verses 22 to 24.
[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:26.920]   Read this, consider, consider your calling,
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:29.120]   brothers and sisters, consider your calling
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:32.000]   as I read verses 22 to 24.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.080]   Jews demand signs.
[00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:40.200]   Greeks seek wisdom.
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:46.320]   But we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews.
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:50.520]   And folly to Gentiles or Greeks,
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:52.560]   same, he's using them interchangeably.
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:55.680]   But to those who are called,
[00:12:55.680 --> 00:13:02.280]   both Jews and Greeks, Christ, the power of God
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:03.240]   and the wisdom of God.
[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:06.560]   So when the called look at Christ crucified,
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:08.160]   they don't see stumbling block,
[00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:11.320]   they don't see folly, they see power.
[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:13.280]   So there are three groups, right?
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:14.960]   Three groups in those verses.
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:15.840]   Number one, Jews.
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:16.960]   Number two, Gentiles.
[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:18.360]   Number three, called.
[00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:21.160]   That's not quite accurate, is it?
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.840]   Let me say it a little more carefully.
[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:26.600]   There are Jews who are not called,
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.840]   Gentiles who are not called,
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:31.960]   and Jews and Gentiles who are called.
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:33.360]   Those are the three groups.
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.680]   Are you with me?
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:36.600]   This is, we're considering our calling.
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:38.400]   We're obeying verse 26.
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:45.680]   There are Jews not called, Gentiles not called,
[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:48.760]   Jews and Gentiles, some of whom are called.
[00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:53.440]   And then he describes the response of each to the cross.
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:55.400]   Jews, yeah, stumbling block,
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:58.360]   crucified Messiah, never heard of such a thing.
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.640]   Gentiles, foolishness, a dying God,
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:04.240]   silly, mythological, called power, my God.
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:08.440]   What kind of call is that?
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:14.720]   I'll tell you what kind of call that is.
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:17.640]   It's the kind of call that creates what it commands.
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:25.160]   The call gives light.
[00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:28.120]   The call creates sight.
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:31.160]   The call raises the dead.
[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:36.280]   Lazarus, come forth.
[00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:38.480]   He didn't decide to.
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:41.200]   The call raised him from the dead.
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:44.440]   Let me give you an analogy that could be misleading.
[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:45.960]   It helps me.
[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:47.040]   Just to get your handle on it,
[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:49.200]   because lots of you have never been taught
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:50.280]   about the call of God.
[00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:54.560]   The mighty, effectual, irresistible, powerful,
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:58.560]   saving, wakening, life-giving call of God that saved you.
[00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:00.200]   You've never been taught about this.
[00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:02.400]   So you need a little analogy to help you.
[00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.040]   What is he talking about?
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.600]   I've never heard anything like this.
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:07.920]   I thought I just believed in Jesus.
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:13.000]   Suppose somebody is asleep.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.200]   And you want to wake them up.
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.960]   What do you do?
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:19.800]   Well, you bend over.
[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:20.840]   They're sound asleep.
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:23.400]   You bend over them and you say, "Wake up!"
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:29.520]   And they bolt right upright.
[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:34.200]   Now, what are the dynamics of that moment?
[00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:38.120]   They were sound asleep and bang, they were awake.
[00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:41.960]   Did they hear the call and say,
[00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:45.520]   "I'll think about that before I wake up.
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:48.520]   "And then I'll decide if I want to wake up."
[00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:52.360]   That is a good analogy.
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:57.840]   When God issues a call to your dead heart and says,
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:59.120]   "Wake up!"
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:15:59.960]   You wake up.
[00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:02.960]   You did not make yourself a Christian.
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:05.920]   Just face it, you didn't make yourself a Christian,
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:09.640]   which is why you should feel so incredibly loved.
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:12.120]   In fact, if you need a text to say that,
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:15.160]   just go to Ephesians 2, verse four,
[00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.560]   where Paul says just as clearly as can be,
[00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:20.000]   "Because of his great love."
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.680]   It's the only place he uses that phrase
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:22.800]   in all the New Testament.
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:24.760]   "Because of his great love,
[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:29.000]   "he made you alive when you were dead."
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.960]   So if you have any spiritual life in you at all,
[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:34.400]   you have been greatly loved.
[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:38.040]   It's called regeneration.
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:39.720]   It's called calling.
[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:45.000]   You have been called and you are greatly loved
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.560]   in this calling.
[00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:48.720]   - His great love.
[00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:50.160]   That's amazing, so good.
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:51.320]   I love this clip.
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:54.000]   This is from John Piper's sermon on April 25th, 2010,
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.200]   titled "Consider Your Calling."
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:58.560]   And that sermon is available in its entirety online
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:00.120]   at desiringgod.org.
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:02.200]   I found this clip.
[00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:03.560]   If you find one, email it to me.
[00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:05.480]   Give me your name, hometown, the sermon title,
[00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:07.680]   the timestamp of where the clip happens in the audio,
[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:09.960]   and then make a note of what stands out to you.
[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:11.880]   Put the word clip in the subject line of an email
[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:15.360]   and send it to me at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:19.000]   That's an email address, askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.920]   Well, next time we have a hypothetical question on the table.
[00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:27.440]   If Pastor John was an influential pastor theologian
[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:30.120]   back in 1913 America,
[00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:33.680]   would he have supported Christian temperance organizations
[00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:36.320]   and lent his voice to prohibition?
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:39.840]   That's an interesting question on the role of the church
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:41.880]   in helping outlaws sin.
[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:43.040]   I'm your host Tony Rehnke,
[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:45.480]   and we are rejoined in studio with Pastor John
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:48.360]   to address that question on Friday.
[00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:49.640]   Should be interesting.
[00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:50.560]   We'll see you then.
[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:53.160]   (upbeat music)
[00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:55.760]   (upbeat music)
[00:17:55.760 --> 00:18:05.760]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
