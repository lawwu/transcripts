[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.480]   How do you start to make change?
[00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:03.440]   And then maybe after that, how do you help others?
[00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:09.480]   So the thing that I have done that has helped me more than anything else is to
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.760]   think back over the course of my life about a time when I was, for example,
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.960]   ruinously empathetic and we'll start there because that's the most common
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.400]   mistake that we make and to give that story a name and then when I'm tempted
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.440]   in the future to be ruinously empathetic, to think about that story, I would never.
[00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.460]   Make that mistake again and that I would do everything in my power to help other
[00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.660]   people making that mistake because we all do it.
