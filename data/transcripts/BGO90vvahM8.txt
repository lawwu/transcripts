[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.100]   Pastor John, you have been busy traveling the second half of 2013.
[00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.460]   You traveled from Knoxville to Minneapolis for the DG National Conference on C.S. Lewis,
[00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:18.160]   of course, and then on to Ohio, Atlanta, Idaho, Texas, and now you're out of the country altogether,
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.680]   and will be spending just about all of November in the Middle East.
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.880]   I guess the place to begin is to ask if you've traveled to the UAE before.
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.640]   I have never been to the United Arab Emirates.
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.320]   I've never been to the Middle East at all.
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.360]   In fact, it might help people to know where is that place.
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.040]   My guess is lots of people couldn't put their finger on it.
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:48.720]   The major cities in the UAE, the United Arab Emirates, are Dubai and Abu Dhabi.
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.880]   There are, of course, others, but those are the two where I'll be.
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:01:01.400]   The UAE is on the southern part of the Persian Gulf, borders on the west on Saudi Arabia,
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.980]   and then across the Gulf is Iran.
[00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.260]   So that gives you a perspective on where it is.
[00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:15.440]   On this same trip, I'm going to Ethiopia to Addis Ababa with Jason Meyer, my replacement
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.440]   at Bethlehem.
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.160]   This is really exciting to me.
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.640]   We're going to do a pastor's conference in Ethiopia.
[00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.280]   He's not part of the event in the UAE, so we'll be working through the first five chapters
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.880]   of 2 Corinthians there in Ethiopia, just try to encourage pastors.
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.400]   My sense is what I want to happen there is that pastors not only get encouraged to keep
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.640]   looking at the book and digging, but to be confident they can find meaning for themselves.
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.420]   We want to, Jason and I both, want to help them see what is there so that they can see
[00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.480]   how they can get it without dependence on us.
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:58.720]   But in the UAE, I'll visit two Christian churches, one in Dubai, one in Abu Dhabi, and the political
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:07.460]   leaders in Dubai and Abu Dhabi have been very generous to Christians to approve the building
[00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.720]   of these churches, even to help in the land, I believe.
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.560]   And Muslims, of course, do not believe it is right for any Muslim to convert to Christianity.
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.040]   It's forbidden there.
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:26.760]   But they know that there are thousands of expatriates in the UAE who are not Muslim,
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.600]   and they have been willing, and it seems eager and supportive for these Christians to have
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.320]   a place of worship in both of those cities.
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:43.560]   So I'll be ministering in part, part of the time, along with Mark Dever there to these
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.080]   churches, or to one of the churches with Mark, and I don't think with the other, in doing
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.880]   a conference there.
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:55.000]   And our hope is that we would encourage them, strengthen their faith, show them the greatness
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.120]   of God, stir them up for the kinds of love and good works that Jesus commands of them
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:06.400]   there in the UAE, and it's just a huge privilege to be called to do this.
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.520]   Traveling, Tony, is not my forte.
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:16.360]   I do not like to get on planes and stand in customs lines, and, oh, I get so uptight about
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.320]   these things, and don't sleep all that well on long flights.
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:27.000]   And so I would just love for the folks to pray for us in this, for strength and health
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.440]   and the fullness of the Holy Spirit, and for ripple effects for the glory of Jesus in ways
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.320]   that only He can dream of.
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:42.800]   The dates of the trip are November 3 through 25 for the totality of it, so if the folks,
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.680]   any time during that, find it in their heart to pray, that would be great.
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.160]   Yes, we do appreciate your prayers for Pastor John and for Jason Meyer as well, in their
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.240]   time away, for travel and safety and health, and for the effectiveness of their teaching
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.640]   and preaching there.
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.320]   I'm your host, Tony Ranke.
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.600]   Thanks for listening, and thanks for praying.
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:01.100]   [END]
[00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:02.100]   1.
[00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.100]   What is the Holy Spirit's purpose in the world?
[00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.100]   2.
[00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.100]   What is the Holy Spirit's purpose in the world?
[00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.100]   3.
[00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.100]   What is the Holy Spirit's purpose in the world?
[00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.100]   4.
[00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.100]   What is the Holy Spirit's purpose in the world?
[00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:10.100]   5.
