[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.320]   - We get so many questions from listeners
[00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.640]   who are wondering about God's calling for their lives.
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:11.640]   Who should I marry?
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.920]   What field should I pursue in school?
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.380]   What job should I take?
[00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.440]   Where should I live in a course?
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.040]   Where should I be serving in ministry?
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.000]   Glenn, one such listener, asks,
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.080]   "Pastor John, how do I know if the Holy Spirit
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.360]   "is calling me to international missions?"
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.640]   What would you say?
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.880]   - Let me start by saying that's the right question.
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.680]   And the reason I say that is because
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.600]   a student just asked me two days ago
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.100]   whether I agreed with Hudson Taylor's comment
[00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.100]   that no one needs a call to go into missions,
[00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.120]   but only a call to stay.
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:55.040]   Everyone should be planning to go to the unreached peoples
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.680]   and then God may stop you and call you to stay.
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.700]   And I said to the student, "I don't agree with that.
[00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.580]   "I don't think that's the biblical pattern.
[00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.720]   "It may have some things to commend it
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.180]   "in terms of compassion and proportion,
[00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.400]   "and we should listen to those things,
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.960]   "but biblically, I can't support it."
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.960]   Regularly, God called his prophets,
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.600]   not the other way around.
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.600]   And God does not say that men should all plan to be pastors
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.920]   unless they're called not to be pastors or elders.
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.660]   Rather, he sets up patterns of assessment
[00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.660]   and assumes that relatively few, just the needed number,
[00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.840]   will be led into the office of pastor,
[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.240]   teacher, elder, shepherd.
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.740]   And Paul writes to the Romans to solicit their support
[00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.060]   in his mission to Spain, and he doesn't say a word
[00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.600]   about anyone in Rome going with him.
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.840]   And all the epistles of the New Testament
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.000]   are written with the explicit or implicit assumption
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.800]   people stay right where they are,
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.280]   salt and light in their present vocations,
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.880]   like Paul said in 1 Corinthians 7.20,
[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.840]   each one should remain in the condition
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.920]   in which he was called.
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.680]   So that's the right question.
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.600]   That was my point.
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.420]   Glenn is asking the right question.
[00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.360]   So let's start with Romans 12.2.
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.880]   Do not be conformed to this world,
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.740]   but be transformed by the renewing of your mind
[00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.720]   that you may prove what is the will of God,
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.240]   what is good and acceptable and perfect.
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:40.240]   So discerning the will of God assumes a renewed mind.
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.080]   I am assuming that the will of God here
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:50.040]   refers not to commandments of Scripture,
[00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.840]   which you don't need a renewed mind to read and know.
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:55.880]   Like, "Thou shalt not kill."
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.120]   You don't need a renewed mind to know
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.140]   that's against the will of God.
[00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.840]   I'm assuming that what Paul is talking about
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.840]   in Romans 12.2 is how do biblical teachings
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.160]   and all the other relevant factors
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.160]   conspire to produce a direction for my life
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.240]   that God approves and will bless.
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.680]   Which leads now to a second thing.
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.120]   That renewal comes mainly through
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.340]   the Word of God and prayer.
[00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.060]   So when it says be renewed in your mind,
[00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.360]   I think he means soak your mind, marinate your mind,
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.840]   saturate your mind with the Word of God.
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.440]   The Christian mind is shaped by the Word of God,
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.620]   all the while praying, praying, praying.
[00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:47.840]   Oh God, shape me.
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.000]   Oh God, make me.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.320]   Oh God, bring me into conformity to this Word
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.200]   at the depths of my being.
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.200]   Now, out of that renewed mind and that prayerful experience,
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:05.700]   what the mind does to discern a call to missions
[00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.360]   is to take seriously about seven things.
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.520]   Number one, the renewed mind takes seriously
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:14.920]   your spiritual gifts.
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:15.900]   What are they?
[00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.240]   God is not calling you to do something
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.760]   he has not gifted you to do.
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.240]   What's the gifting?
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:26.240]   And I think gifting that Paul and Peter have in mind
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.680]   is summed up in 1 Peter 4.10.
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.240]   As each has received a gift,
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.840]   use it to serve one another as good stewards
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.360]   of God's varied grace.
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.560]   That's what gifts are.
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:46.560]   Varied grace incarnate in human personalities,
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.560]   which we steward for the good of others.
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.560]   Do you know how God is gifting you in this way?
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.880]   Number two, the renewed mind takes seriously
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.680]   the needs that you see in the world
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.680]   and the ones that move you most deeply.
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.680]   I wonder if we have thought enough
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.760]   about the implications of what Paul says
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.040]   in Romans 12, six to eight, when he's talking about gifts.
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:24.040]   He says, "The one who exhorts, let him do it with exhortation.
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.960]   The one who contributes in generosity,
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.560]   the one who leads with zeal,
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:35.360]   the one who does acts of mercy with cheerfulness."
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.400]   Now, every Christian is supposed to exhort.
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.900]   Every Christian is supposed to be generous.
[00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.040]   Every Christian is supposed to show mercy.
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:51.040]   And yet, Paul treats those three things as gifts.
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:56.480]   And it seems to me that this would imply
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:01.480]   that some people would study a cluster of needs
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:06.260]   in the world, a people group, a crisis situation,
[00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:12.120]   and a very special God-given compassion
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:16.720]   or mercy or generosity or bent to give
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:21.680]   would be imparted to that person.
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:26.600]   And it would constitute a very significant component
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.600]   of a person's calling.
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:34.600]   So take seriously not just the objective real needs
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.240]   that you are looking at in the world,
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.800]   in the lostness and the hurt of people,
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.480]   but how does that affect you?
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.760]   How does it affect you?
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:48.400]   And then study that in relation to Romans 12, 8,
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.660]   where one who does acts of mercy
[00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:53.320]   is to do it with cheerfulness,
[00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:57.600]   as though there is some special mercifulness
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.280]   that God gives to some people
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.160]   and some special compassion
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.880]   that he gives to some people for missions.
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:08.560]   Number three, the renewed mind takes seriously its skills.
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.480]   And by this, I'm not thinking mainly of spiritual gifts,
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:12.880]   and they may overlap,
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:17.020]   but practical skills that God may put to use
[00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:19.700]   in a special way in some context,
[00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:24.700]   like with finances or carpentry or organization
[00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:28.840]   or dozens of possible abilities that may flourish,
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:32.680]   especially helpful way on the mission field.
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:36.340]   Number four, the renewed mind takes seriously
[00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:40.840]   recurrent and growing interest and awareness
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:42.880]   of a place or a people.
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.400]   When God is moving someone into missions,
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:49.180]   he is ordinarily giving them a recurring,
[00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:50.720]   not just a flash in the pan,
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:55.080]   but a recurring and growing interest
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:58.920]   and awareness of a need he's leading them to.
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:02.000]   So my question for people is, what are you reading about?
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.440]   What are you investigating?
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:05.680]   What do you return to again and again?
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:07.560]   What are you finding compelling
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:10.640]   as you ponder the needs of the world?
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:14.840]   Number five, the renewed mind takes seriously
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:19.840]   the growing desire of the heart for the work of missions.
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.480]   So desire.
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:25.600]   1 Timothy 3, one says that elders are to aspire to
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.160]   and desire the work of the ministry.
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.800]   And I take that as a principle
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:35.800]   that God uses to draw us into his work.
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:43.280]   Do you find this work desirable?
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:45.600]   Is your desire growing?
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:49.240]   Is it reaching the point of irresistibility?
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:53.280]   That's what happened for me on October 14, 1979,
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:56.920]   when I was struggling with whether to stay a professor
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:00.000]   at a college or whether to be a pastor.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.320]   And all I knew to say was that at about midnight that night,
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:09.320]   it became irresistible after years of brewing.
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:15.100]   Number six, the renewed mind takes seriously
[00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:20.040]   the affirmation and confirmation of the local church.
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:22.560]   It's essential that you be part of a local church.
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:26.520]   This is the normal way of being a Christian.
[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:28.120]   And it's the only way I know anybody
[00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:29.120]   who could go to the mission field
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:30.840]   and know what to do once he got there
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.360]   if he weren't experienced in a local church,
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:36.600]   'cause it's churches that we want to come into being
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.520]   so that believers have a way to be discipled there.
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:42.600]   And part of the experience of the local church
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:46.240]   is to confirm our gifts and confirm our desires
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:50.440]   and confirm our skills and confirm our compassion.
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:52.280]   And without that confirmation,
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:54.320]   we will tend to be loners
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.840]   who can very easily mistake God's leading.
[00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:00.680]   And the last thing I would say is the renewed mind
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:04.000]   wants to glorify God above everything.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.760]   We want to see the glory of God celebrated in the world.
[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:12.400]   And so in all of these things,
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:15.920]   are we pursuing the glory of God?
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:19.240]   Do we see what I'm being led to
[00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:23.600]   as what will glorify God most?
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.560]   So immerse yourself in the word,
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.080]   pray without ceasing,
[00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:29.320]   take these seven factors seriously,
[00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:34.320]   and the effect I think will be that you'll know eventually.
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:37.000]   Amen, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.800]   And if you are called to missions, where should you start?
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:45.480]   This was the focus of episode number 236 in the podcast.
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:47.960]   It's titled, "I May Be Called to Missions,
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:49.600]   "Where Do I Start?"
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.040]   Find that episode and keep up

[00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:03.120]   Well, as Christians, we all long for the day
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.880]   when we enter into God's city,
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:07.480]   where we will dwell with him forever.
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:08.880]   Of course, it will have no temple,
[00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:11.160]   for the Lord God, the Almighty, and the Lamb
[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.640]   will shine like the noonday sun.
[00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:17.360]   So what does it mean to live in God's presence right now?
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:21.040]   And how do I know if I'm living in God's presence right now?
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:23.040]   It's a good question, and we will address it.
[00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:24.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.640]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
