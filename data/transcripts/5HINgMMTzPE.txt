[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   A question I often get is how long should I try to focus?
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.700]   Well, the research literature point to the key importance
[00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.380]   of so-called ultradian cycles.
[00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.140]   You've all probably heard of circadian cycles
[00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.740]   or circadian biology circa the day,
[00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.580]   circadian is about 24 hour cycle.
[00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.660]   Well, our brain and body operate within that day
[00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.540]   or within each and every day, I should say,
[00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.220]   with 90 minute ultradian cycles.
[00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.800]   So my suggestion would be anytime you're going to sit down
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.400]   and try and focus, you're going to try and do a focused bout
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.520]   of physical exercise or skill learning or musical learning,
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.180]   or maybe you're even just having a conversation,
[00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.120]   maybe you're a therapist or you're attending therapy
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.040]   or a class, how long should it be?
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.880]   And the ideal duration is about 90 minutes,
[00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.440]   not exactly 90 minutes,
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.760]   but we can reliably say 90 minutes or less, okay?
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.700]   It doesn't have to be the full 90 minutes,
[00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.600]   but trying to push yourself to be able to drop
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.400]   into two hours of focus or three hours of focus
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.060]   while possible is not really in line
[00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.120]   with what we know about the underlying biology.
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.960]   Everything from our sleep states
[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.660]   or the different stages of sleep and our waking states
[00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.920]   is divided into these 90 minute cycles
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.380]   or so-called ultradian cycles.
[00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.080]   So what I like to do is set a timer for 90 minutes.
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.760]   I acknowledge and accept the fact that under most conditions
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.840]   unless I'm really pressed for a deadline
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.000]   and I'm optimally caffeinated, et cetera,
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.480]   the first five to 10 minutes of that 90 minutes
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.600]   are a transition time.
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.960]   It's like the warmup for focus,
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.920]   but I do include it in that 90 minutes.
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.220]   And then I really try and drop into
[00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.340]   doing focused mental work or learning of some sort.
[00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.800]   Again, this could be physical as well,
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:34.980]   motor skill learning,
[00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.560]   or I think we're running or lifting weights, et cetera,
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.140]   and really try and drop into that
[00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.400]   across the full 90 minutes.
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.740]   Again, accepting the fact, okay?
[00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:43.640]   It's not just an idea,
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.660]   the fact that occasionally our focus will flicker.
[00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:47.980]   It will jump out of focus.
[00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:49.700]   And then a big part of being able to focus
[00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:50.940]   is to go back to focusing.
[00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.260]   The way I'd like you to conceptualize this perhaps
[00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.660]   is that arrowhead suddenly getting very, very broad,
[00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:56.960]   that you're focusing on many things,
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.120]   or that arrow shifts to a different location in the room.
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.080]   The key is to be able to shift it back
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.380]   and to narrow it once again.
[00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.260]   And that's an active process,
[00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.200]   so much so that it requires a lot of metabolic energy.
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.200]   Your brain is the chief consumer of metabolic energy.
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.700]   The calories that you consume
[00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.040]   is so-called basal metabolic rate.
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.560]   Most of that isn't related to movement
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.560]   or heartbeat or breathing.
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.360]   It's related to brain function.
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.740]   Your brain is a glutton with respect to caloric need.
[00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.660]   So understand that at the end of 90 minutes,
[00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.240]   or maybe even after 45 minutes,
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.960]   you might feel rather tired or even exhausted.
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.000]   And it's very important that after about a focus,
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.720]   that you take at least 10 minutes,
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.800]   and ideally as long as 30 minutes,
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.480]   and go through what I call deliberate defocus.
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.080]   You really want to focus on somewhat menial tasks
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.680]   or things that really don't require
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.720]   a ton of your concentration.
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.160]   This is starting to become a little bit
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.040]   of a movement out there in the kind of pop psychology
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.840]   and optimization world.
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.140]   This idea of not looking at your phone
[00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.460]   as you walk down the hall to the bathroom,
[00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:56.980]   certainly not looking at your phone in the bathroom.
[00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.380]   And I should mention, by the way,
[00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.540]   this is a particular annoyance of mine.
[00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.460]   Have you noticed that wait times for restrooms
[00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.420]   in public places has increased substantially
[00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:06.680]   in the last 10 years?
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.500]   The reason for that is not digestive, okay?
[00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.060]   It's not the gut microbiome.
[00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.500]   I mean, it might be the gut microbiome,
[00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.320]   but chances are it's because people are on their phones
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.160]   in the bathroom.
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.900]   So you're doing yourself and everybody else a favor
[00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.300]   by staying off your phone in the restroom,
[00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.220]   staying off your phone while walking down the hall,
[00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.300]   try and give yourself some time to deliberately decompress,
[00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.060]   to let your mental states idle,
[00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.900]   to not be focused on any one thing.
[00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.900]   That period of idling is essential
[00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.260]   for your ability to focus,
[00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.340]   much in the same way that rest between sets
[00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.420]   of resistance training or rest between exercise
[00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.100]   is vital to being able to focus and perform
[00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.640]   during the actual sets or during the actual bouts
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.940]   of running or cycling or whatever
[00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.060]   your particular form of exercise might be.
[00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.220]   So deliberate decompression is key.
[00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.660]   And I know this is hard because we're all being drawn in
[00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.020]   by the incredible rich array of sensory information
[00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.340]   available on our phones and other devices,
[00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.260]   but I can't emphasize this enough.
[00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.800]   Our ability to focus is not just related
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.660]   to what happens during the entry
[00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.740]   and movement through those focus bouts,
[00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.620]   but after those focus bouts,
[00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.420]   we really need to deliberately decompress.
[00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.180]   And of course, the ultimate decompress,
[00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.260]   the time in which we are not directing our thinking
[00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.740]   and our action is during sleep.
[00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:20.120]   And so it's no wonder,
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.100]   or I should say it holds together logically
[00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.300]   that that deep long-lasting duration
[00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.820]   of not controlling where our mind is at
[00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.340]   is in fact the ultimate form of restoration,
[00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.180]   even if we have very intense dreams.
[00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.560]   So take that period after each 90 minute
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.760]   or less focus bout, right?
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.020]   Remember those focus bouts don't have to be full 90 minutes.
[00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.740]   Let's say you do 45 minutes of work.
[00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:40.580]   You're just done with it.
[00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.180]   Set it down and go do something for maybe five, 10,
[00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.980]   maybe even 30 minutes that is functional for your day,
[00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.820]   right, just not just walking around in circles
[00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:49.740]   or staring up at the sky,
[00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.580]   although if you can do that, do that.
[00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.140]   But most of us have other things to do,
[00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.780]   but do things that are rather automatic
[00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:55.900]   or reflexive for you,
[00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.300]   and try not to do any focused reading,
[00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.140]   try not to bring your vision into a tight location,
[00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:02.340]   such as your phone,
[00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.280]   and try and deliberately decompress
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.100]   because that will allow you to drop
[00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.460]   into intense bouts of focus again,
[00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.600]   repeatedly and repeatedly throughout the day.
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.180]   [upbeat music]
[00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.600]   [upbeat music]
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.660]   you
