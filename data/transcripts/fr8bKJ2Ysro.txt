[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.560]   A podcast listener named Joe in Pompton Lakes, New Jersey writes in to ask this, "Pastor
[00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:14.840]   John, on Facebook you once wrote this, 'Christ did not die to create saved loners.
[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.760]   He died to create Christ-exalting friendships.'"
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.040]   Can you please explain this?
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.180]   A lot of Christians are loners.
[00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.040]   Many of them are hurting, perhaps victims of the church or perhaps are victims of the
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.660]   lies that they believe.
[00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.800]   How would you encourage or motivate Christian loners?
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:37.840]   There are a lot of Christian loners, some by choice and some not by choice.
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:48.440]   And my point was God's aim in the death and resurrection and work of Christ today is to
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.800]   move people beyond that stage.
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.440]   If they're in it, if you're in a stage where you are a Christian loner because you want
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.600]   to be or you're a Christian loner because you feel like people have given you no choice
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.200]   but to be, God sent his Son to change that.
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:19.980]   He wants to move you not just to be a soul-satisfied friend of Jesus, but to be a soul-satisfied
[00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:26.760]   friend to friends so that you experience Jesus through others as well as directly.
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.560]   And here's where that came from, Tony.
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:36.920]   I preached a few months ago from 2 Timothy 4 where Paul said, "At my first defense, no
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.980]   one stood by me.
[00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:45.840]   Everybody deserted me, but the Lord stood by me and strengthened me."
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.520]   Now you could take that verse and say, "See?
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.840]   He didn't need people.
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.280]   Jesus was his friend.
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.000]   Jesus will never fail.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.280]   People will always fail you.
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.520]   I'm tired of dealing with people.
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.480]   They're just fickle and they let you down, and I'm going to be like Paul and have the
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.480]   Lord stand by me, and if everybody forsakes me, that's their problem.
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.480]   I've got Jesus."
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:16.880]   That is totally not what Paul experienced in that chapter because he said just a little
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:23.480]   bit later to Timothy, "Do your best to come to me before winter."
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.560]   And he said a little earlier, "Luke alone is with me.
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.680]   Get Mark.
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:28.680]   Bring him with you.
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.040]   He is useful to me in the ministry."
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.800]   This is Paul's heart in all of his letters.
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.440]   Paul hated being in ministry alone.
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.800]   When he was forced to go alone to Athens, the first thing he did was send back, "Please
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.080]   get Timothy and the team down here as soon as you can.
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.160]   I don't want to be here in this city by myself."
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:59.960]   And so I think it stands that Christ died so that we would not be Christian loners but
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:05.800]   would be in Christ-exalting friendships because, if you say, "Why?"
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.200]   It's because there's more of Christ to be known in Christ-exalting friendships.
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.240]   You know, I don't want to twist the arm of a loner and say, "You ought to do this, and
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.440]   it's your duty to do this."
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.400]   I want to say, "You're missing something, really missing something.
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.120]   There is more of Christ to be known.
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.720]   There's more of God to be known.
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:31.400]   God said to a happy man, 'It is not good for you to be alone.'
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:37.880]   And Paul said to a church, 'The eye can't say to the hand, "I have no need of you."
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.080]   The head can't say to the feet, "I have no need of you."'"
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.080]   They can't.
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.260]   And if you're a head or an eye or a hand or a finger or a pinky or a big toe standing
[00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.680]   off by yourself saying, "I don't need them," you're wrong.
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.440]   Paul says you're wrong.
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.440]   So here's my encouragement.
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.700]   First of all, to the loners who think they don't need others, I would say, "You're kicking
[00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.600]   against the pricks.
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:09.760]   God has more for you, much more of himself than you will have on your own."
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.600]   And the thing I'd say by way of encouragement to the Christian loner who feels that he or
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:25.680]   she has no choice, that they've been kicked into loneliness, I would say, "I'm sorry for
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.880]   what has happened to you.
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.840]   I'm sorry that that's been done to you."
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:37.320]   And I would say, "Please, don't give up on the one never-failing friend because other
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.480]   friends have failed you."
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:47.760]   And I would say, "For the sake of Christ, forgive those who have failed you."
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.160]   Unforgiveness is suicidal.
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.900]   It hurts you more than it hurts them.
[00:04:52.900 --> 00:05:00.800]   And I would say, "Move toward a Bible-preaching church with the prayer that God will guide
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:01.800]   you.
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:02.800]   He has a community for you.
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.620]   Trust him for this."
[00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:14.240]   And I would say, finally, "Be for others what you long for them to be for you."
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.240]   Yes.
