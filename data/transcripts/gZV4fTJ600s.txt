[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.920]   You remember that in dealing with what are called the sacraments in general, we reminded
[00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:13.280]   ourselves that there are but two that are recognised in the Protestant Church in general,
[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:19.440]   baptism and the Lord's Supper. We considered baptism last Friday evening and we are now
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:25.840]   coming to consider the Lord's Supper. I was saying a few moments ago that I had not
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:32.960]   been able to keep to my programme as I thought, and the difficulty is of course constantly
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.120]   to know how much to leave out. Now if that has been a difficulty all along the line,
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.400]   it is very much a difficulty in connection with this subject that we are going to look
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.920]   at together this evening. It has been a subject of great debate and of controversy in the
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:55.360]   Christian Church for a number of centuries, especially since the Protestant Reformation,
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:01.000]   and great and mighty works have been written on this subject. It would be a very simple
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.760]   thing indeed to go into all that, but I have decided resolutely not to do so. And that
[00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:16.320]   for this good reason, that most of the controversy that has arisen has not really arisen on the
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.680]   basis of the biblical teaching at all, but rather because of the additions to the biblical
[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:30.360]   teaching for which the Roman Catholic Church and her followers have been responsible. In
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.680]   other words, I say this for those who are interested in method, as distinct from matter
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:45.040]   at the moment, there is a very real difference and distinction between what you may call
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:53.920]   biblical theology and systematic theology. Now biblical theology really means a doctrine
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.840]   which arises directly out of the teaching of the Word itself. But you cannot go into
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.520]   a systematic consideration of doctrine without also considering what has been taught in the
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:12.160]   Church from time to time throughout the centuries. Now in all this series, we really have been
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:18.720]   trying to deal with biblical doctrine, but I have made references in passing to other
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:25.640]   teachings because I have judged that we all have heard something about these other teachings
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.440]   and we like to know what the answer to them is, and how they came into being, and where
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:36.040]   we think they're wrong, and so on. But I've been trying as best I can, you will be the
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:42.080]   judges as to how far I have succeeded, in really keeping it to biblical doctrine, and
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:48.520]   in avoiding going into the history of the doctrines overmuch as they have been developed
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:54.000]   in the long story of the Christian Church. So if some of you go away disappointed tonight
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.120]   because I'm not going to deal in a detailed manner with the Roman Catholic teaching about
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:06.000]   transubstantiation, that is my reason for not doing so. Otherwise, it seems to me that
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.400]   our series of discussions on biblical doctrine would become almost endless. Therefore, I'm
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.440]   going to pick out what I regard as being really important.
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:24.720]   Now there are only two real standpoints with regard to this communion of the Lord's Supper.
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.800]   The typical Catholic point of view. And when I say Catholic, I mean not only Roman Catholics,
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:38.160]   I mean Anglo-Catholics, and a group now becoming known as Scotto-Catholics in Scotland, and
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:46.280]   various others who belong to various ritualistic movements, even in certain of the free churches,
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:52.000]   certain sacramentarian and sacramental societies are coming into being. And they all can be
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:00.080]   included under this generic title of Catholic. They are the people who in various forms believe
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:10.440]   in that teaching which goes by the name of transubstantiation. In other words, they believe
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:19.440]   that as the result of the action of the priest, that the very bread is changed, literally,
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.800]   into the body of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:30.880]   Now that was a doctrine which began to make its appearance in the church in the Middle
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:36.680]   Ages, which was more or less then nothing but the Roman Church or the Western Church.
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.240]   But it wasn't defined by them until the 12th century. Then it was held from there on as
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.560]   the official doctrine of the church until the Reformation. They still hold it, and as
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:53.880]   I say, certain others are going back to that. Now that is the teaching, that the body, the
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:05:03.000]   bread, actually becomes the physical, literal, physical body of the Lord Jesus Christ. They've
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.600]   weaved a great philosophy around it. If you say to them, "Well, how can that have happened?"
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.640]   They say, "When I look at it, I still see bread. I still see something that looks like
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:18.640]   bread which is white and still seems to have the texture of bread and still tastes like
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:25.720]   bread." To which they would reply, "Yes, that's perfectly all right." But they say that anything
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:35.360]   that you see can be divided into two main sections or divisions, the substance and the
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.520]   accidents. Now I'm not going to keep you with this, but I do think that it is important
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.200]   that we should know something about it, because there are so many people today who say that
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:50.400]   they're being blessed by such teaching. And you will find always that when true Protestantism
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:56.640]   is lifeless and lethargic, there is always a strange attraction to some people from this
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:01.360]   sacramental teaching that offers to do it all for you, and you've got nothing to do
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.720]   but to receive it, and it acts almost automatically. Well, their reply, I say, is something like
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:12.400]   this. They say, "The whiteness of bread doesn't belong to the substance of bread, that's
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:20.520]   one of the accidents. Likewise, the texture and the taste, they are what they call the
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:26.800]   accidents of bread. But the real substance is something quite apart from all that."
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:32.340]   So you see, they argue that you can change the substance without affecting the accidents.
[00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:38.560]   And what they really believe is that the substance of bread is no longer what it was, it becomes
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:45.880]   the actual body of the Lord, but the accidents, the whiteness and the texture and the taste
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:50.840]   and things like that remain as they were before. By this miracle, you change the substance
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:56.560]   without changing the accidents. And of course, as a result of that, you see, believing that
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:02.320]   this is now essentially the body of the Lord, they put it in a special vessel and they work
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:06.840]   to worship it and address their prayers to it. They call it the host, as you know, and
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:11.640]   they take the host in processions and all that follows from that.
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:17.920]   Well, there is no need for us to stay with this, and for this good reason, that even
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:23.800]   the Roman Catholic Church herself is prepared to admit and to agree that their doctrine
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:30.160]   cannot be proved from the Scriptures. Well, I think that's good enough for us. They
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:37.040]   try to say this, they try to lay great emphasis on the fact that our Lord said, "This is
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:43.640]   my body." That "is" they say is all important. They say, "He didn't say, 'This represents
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:50.520]   my body.' He said, 'This is my body.'" And you must take his words literally. There
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:56.400]   are many obvious answers to that. There was our Lord standing in his body. How could he
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:01.320]   therefore mean that that bread there in front of him was actually his body? He was speaking
[00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:07.080]   in the body at the time, and there was bread in his hand. That's one answer.
[00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:12.260]   But another answer, and in many ways a more powerful answer, is this, and an answer which
[00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:20.320]   the Roman Catholics can never deal with. He later goes on to say, "This cup is the New
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:25.880]   Testament in my blood." And therefore you can say to them that if they insist upon the
[00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:30.160]   "is" in the one case, they must insist upon it in the other. And therefore say that the
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:35.760]   wine doesn't matter at all, it's the cup that matters. Because what he said was, "This
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:41.720]   cup," not the wine that's in the cup, "This cup is the New Testament in my blood." And
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:47.060]   of course there is, as I say, no answer to that. In other words, the attempt to face
[00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:54.260]   this doctrine of transubstantiation onto that one word "is" is something which is not
[00:08:54.260 --> 00:09:00.840]   only quite unscriptural, it is indeed unreasonable. And the fact is, of course, that the whole
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:07.360]   doctrine came into the Church simply in order to enhance the position and the status of
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:13.240]   the priests. It is only the priest who can work this miracle, and of course as he alone
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:18.660]   can do it, he becomes correspondingly important, and it's a part of the whole movement to
[00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:25.560]   exaggerate the importance of the priest. Now, historically, you know that around about
[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:32.880]   the 1830s, John Henry Newman, afterwards known as Cardinal Newman and Keble and others, began
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:39.560]   that Anglo-Catholic movement in this country, and quite deliberately. They did say, and
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:45.920]   they were not ashamed to say, that they thought the only way of saving the Church, because
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:51.440]   the Church had then got into a very bad condition, they said the only way to save the Church
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:57.120]   is to exalt the position of the minister, the priest. And obviously they chose one of
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:04.640]   the time-honoured methods of doing that, namely by adopting again this old doctrine of transubstantiation.
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:11.160]   You see that I am greatly tempted, and that I am exercising most commendable restraining
[00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:18.160]   grace, and I must keep to my word and refrain from going into it in further detail. That,
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:24.040]   however, in its essence is the position. Well now, the Lutherans, again you may be interested
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:29.960]   to know, have a slightly different view. They don't believe in transubstantiation. They
[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:36.200]   believe in what they call consubstantiation. What does that mean? Just this. They say,
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:41.720]   no, the Catholics are wrong. There is no change in this substance of the bread. The bread
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:49.120]   still remains bread. But the body of the Lord becomes joined to the bread. Con- meaning
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:55.640]   with. It is consubstantial with it, so that you have got the bread and the body of the
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:11:02.960]   Lord at the same time. It is with and under the bread. Well, that of course doesn't
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:12.000]   really change the position very much. It avoids that philosophical position of this distinction
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.520]   between substance and exigence, but really it leaves the position very much where it
[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:23.920]   was before. And I think it is generally agreed that the Lutheran position there is most unsatisfactory.
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:29.680]   Luther having started at the beginning by seeing this thing clearly, afterwards weakened
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:34.040]   and was influenced by some of his friends and went back to that rather unhealthy and
[00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:39.240]   unsatisfactory compromise with the old Catholic position.
[00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:43.480]   Then it is interesting, I think, to notice how the different Protestant reformers did
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:48.560]   hold different views about this matter. The next to refer to is Zwingli, of course. You
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:55.000]   remember I referred to Zwingli's view of baptism. Well, Zwingli at any rate was consistent
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:01.320]   with himself. He regarded the Lord's Supper as purely a sign.
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:05.920]   Unfortunately a small portion of the original tape is missing at this point. We rejoin the
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:11.680]   Doctor now as he goes on to discuss the typical reform doctrine of the Lord's Supper.
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:20.480]   That this again, as we saw in baptism, is not only a sign but also a seal. You see in
[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:24.080]   dealing with sacraments in general we have covered that, so we have simply got to apply
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:27.720]   that teaching now to this particular matter.
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:34.480]   So that we come to the vital question, what are the things that are signified by the communion
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:39.760]   of the Lord's Supper? And there is no difficulty about answering that. The first thing that
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:46.800]   is signified is the Lord's death. Now Paul states that explicitly in that paragraph,
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:52.840]   in that statement in 1 Corinthians 11. He says, "As often as ye eat this bread and
[00:12:52.840 --> 00:13:02.360]   drink this cup, ye will do so." Proclaim the Lord's death till he come.
[00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:07.560]   The breaking of the bread and the drinking or the pouring and the drinking of the wine
[00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:14.880]   are a representation of our Lord's death, his broken body, his shed blood. That is in
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:22.400]   many ways the primary thing that is signified by this action. And we are told there specifically
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:28.020]   to do this for that reason, that we are declaring it in that way.
[00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:33.040]   And again may I underline something I think I said a fortnight ago at this point. Do we
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:39.680]   not see here a wonderful provision made by the Lord himself? For there have been periods
[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:45.320]   in the history of the church when the Lord's death rarely has scarcely been preached at
[00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:52.120]   all from the pulpits. It has been denied, it has been misrepresented and abused. Yes,
[00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:57.720]   but because our Lord had ordained and had given this commandment, as Paul says, "I
[00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:02.400]   have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you," and he commended the
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:09.800]   other apostles, you remember, in the same way. Though the pulpit may have fangled, the
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:18.080]   Lord's Supper has still gone on declaring, proclaiming, preaching the Lord's death.
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:24.040]   And often there has been that great incongruity, not to say contradiction, between the preaching
[00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:30.400]   of men and the preaching of the bread and the wine upon the communion table. It sets
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:40.400]   forth, it portrays the Lord's death. But not only that, it also is a declaration of
[00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:49.200]   and a sign of the believer's participation in the crucified Christ. We are in communion
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:56.640]   with him. It reminds us of that and of our union with him, and therefore our participation
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:01.640]   in his death. You remember the rich teaching about that in the sixth chapter of the epistle
[00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:08.960]   to the Romans, that we are in Christ and that because we are in Christ we have died with
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:13.400]   him and we have been buried with him and we have risen again with him. Well, it declares
[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:19.700]   that therefore. This communion element declares that, the union of the believer with Christ
[00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:28.020]   and his participation in his death. But in addition to that, and this is something tremendously
[00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:37.220]   important, it is a reminder to us and a declaration that we participate in all the benefits of
[00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:42.940]   the new covenant. You notice how that again came out in these words which are written
[00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:49.420]   by the apostle in verse 25 in that eleventh chapter of 1 Corinthians. After the same manner
[00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:57.060]   also he took the cup when he had sat saying, "This cup is the new testament, yes the new
[00:15:57.060 --> 00:16:08.180]   covenant in my blood. This do ye as oft as ye drink it in remembrance of me."
[00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:12.300]   Now I remember distinctly about a year ago, and numbers of you remember it, in dealing
[00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:19.020]   with the Lord's death and the doctrine concerning the Lord's death, we spent an evening in showing
[00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:26.940]   how the death of the Lord also was the ratification of the new covenant. You'll read about that
[00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:32.340]   new covenant in the epistle to the Hebrews in the eighth chapter and in the tenth chapter
[00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:40.260]   in particular, and indeed in the ninth also. And there it is, our Lord's death is the blood
[00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:47.100]   that is shed upon the new covenant, ratifying the new covenant and all that it leads to.
[00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:56.020]   Well very well then, the communion service is a reminder to us of all that. That in and
[00:16:56.020 --> 00:17:01.500]   through our Lord Jesus Christ God has made a new covenant with believers. He is the mediator
[00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:08.860]   of the new covenant. He is the head and representative of men in this new covenant, this new agreement,
[00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:13.700]   this marvelous new covenant that God makes with men. And you remember that in that eighth
[00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:21.060]   of Hebrews you get that striking contrast drawn between these two covenants, and it's
[00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:29.060]   interesting to note them. Listen. "For finding fault with the first, he saith, 'Behold, the
[00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:33.220]   days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and
[00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:38.140]   with the house of Judah, not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers
[00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:42.380]   in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt, for this
[00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:47.460]   is the new covenant that I will make. After those days, saith the Lord, I will put my
[00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:53.940]   laws into their mind and write them in their hearts, no longer on stone outside, but in
[00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:59.220]   their minds and in their hearts. And I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me
[00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:05.260]   a people. And they shall not teach every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying,
[00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:12.260]   'Know the Lord, for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest. For I will be merciful
[00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:21.340]   to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.'"
[00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:26.140]   Now then, every time we meet at the communion table and partake of the Lord's Supper, we
[00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:33.340]   are declaring that. We are declaring this new covenant, and all the contents of the
[00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:38.460]   new covenant of which we are reminded there in the eighth of Hebrews. You see what a tremendous
[00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:45.660]   thing it is to meet at that table and to take the bread and the wine. Yes, but we don't
[00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:53.820]   stop even at that. In addition to that, we are reminded by the partaking of the bread
[00:18:53.820 --> 00:19:04.700]   and the wine, that we as believers also receive life and strength to live this Christian life
[00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:10.720]   from the Lord Jesus Christ himself. Now let me take you to the statement, the verses which
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:17.500]   tell us that. They are to be found in the sixth chapter of the Gospel according to Saint
[00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:26.060]   John. But before I read them, let me say this. This section in the sixth chapter of the Gospel
[00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:32.980]   according to Saint John has been a matter of considerable dispute in this way. Was our
[00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:40.420]   Lord here referring to the communion service or was he not? I am one of those who holds
[00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:47.260]   the view that he was not referring to the communion service, and for this good reason.
[00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:51.580]   That at that time the disciples were clearly not capable of receiving such teaching at
[00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:59.300]   all. He only rarely begins to deal with this at the very end in the upper room. So I would
[00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:05.540]   take the view that the sixth of John is not a direct reference to the communion service.
[00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:10.980]   The Roman Catholics of course say it is, it suits their argument to do so, and those who
[00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:17.740]   follow them. But though this is not a reference to the communion service as such, there is
[00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:25.220]   a truth stated in verses 56 and 57 which certainly can be applied at this point, and these are
[00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:34.900]   the words. "He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I in
[00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:45.140]   him. As the living Father hath sent me and I live by the Father, so he that eateth me
[00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:54.580]   even he shall live by me." Now our Lord himself goes on to explain that this was just
[00:20:54.580 --> 00:21:00.860]   a picture because he says this, "When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured
[00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:07.740]   at it, he said unto them, 'Does this offend you? What and if ye shall see the Son of Man
[00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:15.100]   ascend up where he was before? It is the Spirit that quickeneth, the flesh prophet of nothing.
[00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:21.420]   The words that I speak unto you, they are Spirit and they are life." You see how the
[00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:26.060]   Catholics have used it. They say you must literally eat his body. He said so himself,
[00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:29.900]   and yet our Lord has given us the explanation. He said the words that I speak unto you are
[00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:35.460]   Spirit, the flesh prophet of nothing. He said this is a picture. He says you've got to
[00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:40.220]   eat of me, you've got to eat my flesh and drink my blood, which means this, that you've
[00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:45.580]   got to live on me, you've got to live by me. As the Father hath sent me and I live by the
[00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:50.820]   Father, even so I'm sending you and you've got to live by me. Well that was a spiritual
[00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:56.540]   partaking. He didn't say that he was literally eating of the substance of his heavenly Father.
[00:21:56.540 --> 00:22:01.940]   Of course not. It's a spiritual conception. My words are Spirit and they are life. Very
[00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:12.940]   well. You and I have got to live on the Lord Jesus Christ. He is our life. We live on him.
[00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:20.020]   Yes. And the bread and the wine remind us of that. They represent that they are a picture
[00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:25.340]   of that. They are a portrayal of that. As we actually take the bread and eat it, as
[00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:32.020]   we drink the wine and swallow it, we should say yes, I must feed on the Lord as he told
[00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:38.820]   me. I must live on him. I must take of him as he took of the Father. So I will feast
[00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:44.620]   on him as our hymn has just been putting it. Not in a physical sense, but in a spiritual
[00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:52.420]   sense. And the bread and the wine remind me that I must eat the flesh and drink the blood
[00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:59.900]   of the Son of Man in a spiritual sense if I am to be a strong and a virile and a conquering
[00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:07.740]   Christian. There is one other thing that is represented by this communion, by the bread
[00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:17.300]   and the wine, and it is this. It is the union of the believers with one another. They are
[00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:22.500]   not only all joined to Christ, they are all joined to one another. Now the Apostle Paul
[00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:28.380]   has taught this in chapter 10 of his first epistle to the Corinthians. And it is a chapter
[00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:33.900]   that we should always pay careful attention to. The chapter before this chapter in which
[00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:40.940]   he gives the instructions. Listen to this. I will read verses 16 and 17 of the 10th chapter
[00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:47.580]   of the first epistle to the Corinthians. "The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not
[00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:54.340]   the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion
[00:23:54.340 --> 00:24:04.300]   of the body of Christ?" Then listen to this. "For we being many, are one bread and one
[00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:15.700]   body, for we are all partakers of that one bread." Now you see what he is teaching there.
[00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:22.660]   He says that as we partake of Christ we become one. We become, if you like, one loaf. There
[00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:28.580]   are some who say that the 17th verse should be translated like that. "For we being many,
[00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:37.820]   are one loaf, not one bread, and one body." So that as we come to the communion service
[00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:44.420]   and the bread is broken, we are reminded at one and the same time of the parts and yet
[00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:51.740]   of the whole. So that the term communion represents not only our communion with the Lord, but
[00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:58.020]   also our communion with one another. We are bound together in him because we are all in
[00:24:58.020 --> 00:25:05.460]   him. We become one loaf, one bread. And that you see is why the apostle goes on to give
[00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:09.780]   that teaching that came out in my reading at the beginning. He says, "Look here, you
[00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:14.740]   are denying the very principle of communion." He says, "Some of you are eating too much,
[00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:18.300]   others are not having enough to eat. You are selfish, you are divided, you must all be
[00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:23.220]   one. You must wait for one another. Some were having a great feast at home, some were even
[00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:29.620]   coming drunken, strange to relate. And this whole matter was being abused. Can't you
[00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:35.780]   see," says the apostle, "that you are denying one of the central things taught by this action.
[00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:40.060]   That you are all one, you bear one another's burdens, you share what you have with one
[00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:45.300]   another, you are all parts of the same loaf, the same bread. You have communion with one
[00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:50.420]   another as well as with him. And it is idle for you to say that you have communion with
[00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:56.300]   him if you are not in communion with one another." You see, he talks about those divisions and
[00:25:56.300 --> 00:26:02.100]   those heresies and things like that. And he condemns them because they are a denial and
[00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:09.460]   a contradiction of everything that is represented at this point by the communion service.
[00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:16.420]   Well now there are the main things that are signified or portrayed or represented by the
[00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:25.700]   communion of the Lord's Supper. But thank God I say that it doesn't stop at signification.
[00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:33.620]   This action, this communion, this sacrament if you like to so call it, not only signifies
[00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:42.260]   but it also seals things to us. And what does it seal? Well it seals this. It seals all
[00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:47.820]   the benefits about which I have just been speaking. So that when you and I take the
[00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:53.860]   communion we are not only reminding ourselves of something, we are not only indulging in
[00:26:53.860 --> 00:27:00.620]   a memorial or commemorative action, neither are we merely putting on our badge of church
[00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:06.860]   membership as it were, because it is that also. But more than that, something is being
[00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:16.140]   done to us. As we receive that bread and as we receive that wine, God is telling us that
[00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:23.940]   we are participators in the benefits of this new covenant. It seals them all to us. It
[00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:30.420]   seals all these promises of God to which I have been referring. It assures me that he
[00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:36.820]   died for me, that I am joined to him, that I have died with him and have risen with him.
[00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:43.060]   It does indeed assure to me all the benefits of the new covenant. It is like handing me
[00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:49.980]   a document with a seal on it. There it is, this is all yours. The new covenant of God
[00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:56.260]   with men belongs to me. He has made it with me. He is handing it over to me. He is giving
[00:27:56.260 --> 00:28:01.500]   it to me. As the ring put on is an assurance to the person who wears it of the love of
[00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:09.060]   that man, so the bread and the wine are a special assurance given to us by God in his
[00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:15.300]   love and condescension, in order that as we take them we may know that he is giving all
[00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:22.020]   these benefits to us. Very well then, how vital it is and how important that we should
[00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:28.860]   realize this when we come to the communion table. Every minister will tell you that he
[00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:33.460]   has often been asked questions about this. I have been asked it dozens of times. People
[00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:37.820]   have come to me and said, "You know, I don't know what to do in the communion service."
[00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:42.100]   And I have known people who have found it a painful service for this reason. They have
[00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:46.060]   observed certain people in the communion service weeping silently and they say, "But I have
[00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:51.620]   never wept and I can't make myself." Haven't you known something about that? I certainly
[00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:55.980]   remember as a young Christian trying to produce tears because I thought it was the right thing
[00:28:55.980 --> 00:29:02.400]   to do. And yet I found I couldn't. In other words, there is a great deal of sentimentality
[00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:07.820]   about this often times and people are in trouble because they don't know what ought to be happening.
[00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:13.100]   They feel that there ought to be some curious sensation. My friends, the answer is this
[00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:19.580]   doctrine which we are considering together. Remember that here you are not only representing
[00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:24.780]   things you are, we are all doing it together as we take the bread and the wine. He declared
[00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:31.140]   the Lord's death till he come. Yes, but God is also declaring to you. He is sealing these
[00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:36.700]   things to you. Remind yourself of that. Say, "Here God is telling me that I am in the
[00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:42.220]   new covenant, that I am a child of his that he has adopted me, that all the blessings
[00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:47.940]   and the benefits of the new covenant in Christ belong to me and are coming to me and I thank
[00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:54.100]   God for them at this point." In other words, you should always feel thankful at that service.
[00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:58.940]   Some people call it the Eucharist. The Eucharist means thanksgiving, that's all. Don't let
[00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:04.180]   the Catholics rob you of that term. It is the Eucharist for us more than it is for them.
[00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:10.580]   The thanksgiving, the Eucharist, what am I thanking him for? I am thanking him that he
[00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:17.300]   is assuring me in this way. As the young man gives that ring to the object of his love,
[00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:25.260]   God has chosen this method of speaking to us and telling us, "I give you the benefits
[00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:31.860]   of the death of my son and of his life. Take of him. Take freely of him. Live of him and
[00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:37.900]   realize what I am doing for you in and through him." Now then, as we take the bread and
[00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:45.820]   the wine henceforth, therefore, let us remind ourselves that it seals all these glorious
[00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:51.820]   and wonderful things to us. And that brings me to the last thing that I want to say about
[00:30:51.820 --> 00:31:00.180]   this subject, which is this, "Who is to partake of this?" Well, here again, the answer seems
[00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:09.020]   to be perfectly plain and clear, and that is, "Only believers." Obviously, if we do
[00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:14.860]   not realize what we are doing, there is no object and no purpose in it. Our whole view
[00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:21.460]   of this sacrament, as of every other sacrament, is that it depends upon faith. We don't believe
[00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:26.900]   that this acts any more automatically than does baptism. We don't believe in that theory
[00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:31.860]   of the Catholics of ex operae operato, that it operates in its own force and in its own
[00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:39.340]   power with an inevitability, because the grace is in it. Not at all. There is no value in
[00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:43.820]   eating the bread and drinking the wine if you don't do so in faith. There is nothing
[00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:50.460]   in the bread, there is nothing in the wine as such. Faith is essential. So that it is
[00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:58.140]   only for believers. Yes, remember, for weak believers. Yes, remember, even for sinful
[00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:03.620]   believers. It doesn't mean that you have to be perfect before you can come here.
[00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:09.260]   May I tell you again, I say again because I remember saying this once at a communion
[00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:14.420]   service in this church on a Sunday, but many of you were not present, a great story about
[00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:20.340]   the famous Rabbi Duncan, that great Scotsman who taught at New College in Edinburgh last
[00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:31.100]   century, a great professor of Hebrew. He on one occasion was taking a communion service
[00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:37.460]   and he was watching what was happening as the elders were taking the elements round.
[00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:43.860]   And he observed one woman in the congregation looking very unhappy, looking distressed in
[00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:49.820]   fact, and she was weeping copiously. But as the elements were brought round to her, she
[00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:58.780]   was refusing them. He saw her refusing the bread, he saw her refusing the wine. And seeing
[00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:04.300]   this he understood exactly what was happening. The woman was so conscious of her sins that
[00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:11.340]   she felt she had no right to partake of that wine. So he got up and he walked to her. And
[00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:16.540]   he took hold of the cup and went back to her and said, "Woman, take it, take it. He died
[00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:22.980]   for sinners." That's perfectly right. The woman was repentant. A repentant sinner has
[00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:26.700]   as much a right if not a greater right to take than anybody else. Yes, but that's a
[00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:32.500]   very different thing from living in sin. What the apostle condemns and what he prohibits
[00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:37.980]   is for a person who is living in sin and who is not repentant to go on taking the bread
[00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:44.540]   and the wine. That he prohibits. And the church throughout the centuries, when she has exercised
[00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:49.620]   discipline, has always prohibited the same thing. But that's a very different thing,
[00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:55.940]   I say, from saying that anybody who is just conscious of sin shouldn't partake. You should,
[00:33:55.940 --> 00:34:01.980]   as long as you are repentant. And in your repentance, remind yourselves of the things
[00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:07.340]   that are sealed to you by the bread and the wine. And if you do it truly, you will end
[00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:13.940]   by thanking God. It will be a true Eucharist to you. And you will go on your way rejoicing.
[00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:19.620]   And you will feel to yourself, "Yes, I will live on Christ. I will eat his flesh and drink
[00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:25.380]   his blood by faith. I will henceforth live on him and I shall not fall into sin." So
[00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:31.700]   you go away with your conscience cleansed, with a joy in your heart of sins forgiven,
[00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:36.500]   and with an assurance of new strength and life and power of which you had not been aware
[00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:43.500]   before. Very well then, we say that it is something that must be received truly by faith.
[00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:51.220]   And if you can't take it in faith, well then it is better for you to refrain. Because you
[00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:58.220]   remember the apostle teaches that if people will not examine themselves, if they will
[00:34:58.220 --> 00:35:05.220]   not examine and judge and condemn themselves and leave their sins, they will be judged.
[00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:12.980]   Did you notice those words? For this cause, because they wouldn't do it, many are weak
[00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:19.820]   and sickly among you and many sleep. He is teaching this specifically that there were
[00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:25.180]   members of the church at Corinth who were weak and others who were ill because they
[00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:31.100]   would not judge themselves as they should and cleanse themselves, but came unworthy
[00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:38.100]   to the Lord's table. And the result is that God has chastised them. He says, you see,
[00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:43.980]   if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. But he says when God does judge
[00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:49.460]   us and punish us in that way, he does so, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should
[00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:55.620]   not be condemned with the world. Which means this, that if we won't listen to the preaching
[00:35:55.620 --> 00:36:01.180]   and the exhortation, well, we may become weak, we may become ill, and we'll begin to ask,
[00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:05.460]   well now, why is this? And we'll be reminded of death and we'll become fearful and we'll
[00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:12.460]   suddenly face our sin and we'll repent and we'll come back and we avoid further condemnation.
[00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:17.860]   And there is indeed this other mysterious phrase, that some even sleep, which means
[00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:24.860]   that they're dead because they would not do this. We don't understand this, but it is
[00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:31.900]   clearly taught here that these people have died because God has in that way chastised
[00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:38.420]   them. It doesn't mean they're lost, but it does mean that God has chastised them even
[00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:45.420]   by means of death itself. They will suffer a certain loss for that in eternity. You remember
[00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:51.660]   we read in the third chapter of 1 Corinthians, certain men's work will be burnt up, it was
[00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:56.660]   wood and hay and stubble. They will suffer loss, yet they themselves shall be saved,
[00:36:56.660 --> 00:37:02.280]   yet so as by fire. It probably means something like that. Therefore I say that when we come
[00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:09.280]   to that table, to the communion, we must keep all these things in our mind and as we do
[00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:16.500]   so it will be a means of great blessing to us. Yes, but remember this, it does nothing
[00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:25.300]   more than the Word does. It does nothing beyond preaching. I said that about baptism, we must
[00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:33.120]   say it. There is no new or additional grace given in the Lord's Supper. Well, what is
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:38.140]   it then? Well, it's what I've been saying. What it does is to add to the effectiveness
[00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:45.140]   of the Word. It adds to our receiving of the grace. There is no special grace, there is
[00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:51.680]   nothing there which you can't have anywhere else. Now, again you see, there is a temptation
[00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:58.000]   to a digression, but my time has gone. There are those who say that the supreme service
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:03.760]   in the church is the communion service. I find no scriptural evidence for that at all.
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:08.400]   No, the supreme sacrament, if you like to call it such, the supreme means of grace in
[00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:14.600]   the church is the Word, the Word preached and taught. This is just another means of
[00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:19.920]   doing this. It's a remarkable one, it's a special one, it's a peculiar one. But
[00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:26.400]   it doesn't give us any peculiar grace, any extra special grace. What it does is to intensify
[00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:32.920]   the grace, to make it more effective to us. Go back to my illustration. The man who puts
[00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:39.840]   the ring on his lady's finger isn't loving her any more at that minute than he was before,
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:45.360]   and yet she's getting something in that intense manner which his declarations do not
[00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:50.760]   give. He's not adding to it, but it's made more effective, it is being intensified.
[00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:56.160]   And it's exactly the same with the communion service and the partaking of the bread and
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:39:03.160]   of the wine. It is one of the means adopted by God to make his own Word to us effective.
[00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:09.320]   It's a portrayal, it's objective, it's something the eyes can see, and it brings
[00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:16.320]   it in that way. And so, we thank God for it, and should ever go from it feeling strengthened
[00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:23.640]   and built up and established in the faith and rejoicing in our great salvation. Well,
[00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:29.280]   we've tried thus to deal hurriedly with the main elements of the teaching of the Bible
[00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:34.080]   concerning the communion of the Lord's Supper.
[00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:38.160]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones. All of
