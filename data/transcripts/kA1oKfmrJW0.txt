[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.120]   We're joined today by Burke Parsons. Burke is Senior Pastor of St. Andrew's Chapel in
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.960]   Sanford, Florida, and he edits Table Talk, the monthly magazine of Ligonier Ministries.
[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.520]   He's on Twitter too, in a way that is very compelling. Thank you for joining us today,
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.760]   Burke. In fact, that's where I want you to start. I want you to riff on a tweet that
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:28.620]   you posted back in May. It was on preaching, and you posted this, "Pastors who deliver
[00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:35.040]   merely intellectually stimulating lectures and not gospel-saturated intellectually stimulating
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:42.200]   worship-driven sermons will always produce auditors and spectators rather than participants
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:50.000]   and passionate worshippers." Explain for us, Burke, what's at the heart of that tweet?
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:59.820]   Thanks, Tony. Essentially, at the very heart of that is really my understanding of the
[00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.780]   role of the pastor. That the pastor is not merely a preacher. That the pastor does indeed
[00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.860]   preach, that we are called to preach, but we are not merely called to preach. Pastors
[00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.380]   are shepherds, and we shepherd God's people, and we serve the Lord's people. These are
[00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.740]   God's flock, as Peter writes, of course. And we are called to serve them in numerous
[00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.300]   ways, and preaching is one of the ways that we do that, and albeit a significant way in
[00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:33.620]   which we do that, of course. So, the pastor in preaching is serving a congregation, serving
[00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:39.340]   families, serving individuals, serving singles, serving young couples, and serving children.
[00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.940]   And so, one of the most significant things that I think we're facing in our day is sort
[00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:50.740]   of the notion of the pulpiteer. You know, we talk about the podcast pastor, which you've
[00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.700]   addressed, I know Pastor John has addressed that, and many well-known pastors and preachers
[00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:02.340]   who have preaching podcasts have addressed that and the problem of it. Well, I think
[00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:09.860]   so often that the notion of the pulpiteer and the preacher-only pastor, that is to say
[00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:17.340]   the one who is only preaching, there tends to develop, I think, within so many churches,
[00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:28.180]   a sort of lecture-style sermon wherein they come to instill or condition a people to think
[00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.620]   that what they're coming for, why they're coming to worship, why they're present there
[00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.780]   at church in corporate worship, is really to be taught, really that they're there for
[00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.900]   the sermon. That, you know, all the other things and all the other portions of the worship
[00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:51.220]   service are really not that important, that our time of prayer, our time of observing
[00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:57.220]   the Lord's Supper and baptism, those are really not that important. So, it's okay if you miss
[00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:02.740]   those. The benediction, the call to worship, whatever elements different churches have
[00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:08.940]   in their worship service, that those things really aren't as crucial or as essential to
[00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.460]   our corporate worship. You know, you have some Christians, of course, who say, "I come
[00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:17.080]   because I really just need the fellowship. I come to worship, I come to church because
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.580]   I need the fellowship." You have some come and say, "Well, I really just want to sing.
[00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:28.740]   I want to sing more and I just want to sing," and they typically equate singing with worship,
[00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.300]   not understanding worship being the entirety of the service, of course. And then you sometimes
[00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.980]   have people, and I think, I would say that by and large, the majority of Christians in
[00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:44.340]   Reformed churches, they tend to say, "I don't really need the singing. I don't really need
[00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:50.100]   anything else. I just need the preaching." That's what's really the most important thing.
[00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:57.420]   Now, we need to stop and say, "Well, preaching is a very important part, a significant part,
[00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:03.580]   but we need to make sure that we don't develop within our people this notion that everything
[00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:10.580]   is centred and fixed around and the spotlight is solely upon the sermon." And so, I think
[00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:18.940]   what happens is, is that pastors begin to feel the pressure to sort of have this perfectly
[00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:26.480]   polished message that ends up looking more like a lecture, more like a lesson that could
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.980]   be taught really in any Sunday school class, rather than a sermon as a part of the worship
[00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:37.540]   service, helping people not simply to come in and sort of fold their arms and say, "Okay,
[00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.980]   let's see what this preacher has for me this week. Let's see what new thing he's going
[00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:47.100]   to teach me this week. Let's see what new fresh thing I'm going to learn that I've not
[00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.580]   learned before." And they fold their arms and they sit there with their arms folded and
[00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:57.540]   they say, "Okay, let me just spectate, let me just watch, let me audit," rather than
[00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:03.120]   seeing themselves as participants, not only in that worship service, but participants
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:08.460]   in that local body, that local congregation, as vital living organisms, as a part of the
[00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:14.520]   larger body of Christ in that congregation, coming not only to sing and coming not only
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:19.620]   to affirm the faith and to pray and to be prayed for, but to come and to sit under the
[00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:25.300]   ministry of the word. You know, that language is all too quickly passing away from the church
[00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:32.060]   today, that we are coming to sit under the ministry of the word as a part of our worship.
[00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:37.300]   And so that means that pastor sermons, our sermons really need to be engaging, that our
[00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:45.100]   sermons need to help fix people's eyes on the author and finisher of our faith, Jesus
[00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:53.100]   Christ, that they need to help fix people's eyes on all that Christ has called us to obey.
[00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:58.140]   As we know from the great commission that Jesus has taught us not only to go and teach,
[00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:03.900]   but he's called us to go and make disciples, teaching them to obey or teaching them to
[00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:09.700]   guard and observe all that Christ commanded. And so the sermon as a part of the whole worship
[00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:15.980]   service of course, really needs to strive to fix people's eyes upon Christ, looking
[00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:21.940]   to him and him alone and his finished work for us as our sole grounds for our being declared
[00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:28.620]   righteous, our being justified by the father and helping people and resting in that and
[00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:34.620]   having assurance in that and finding the freedom that we have in Christ, being engaged now,
[00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:39.380]   not just as auditors, not just as listeners, not just as people looking for something new
[00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:44.580]   or something fresh or something they've never heard before, waiting to have their sort of
[00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:49.820]   theological ears tickled in just the right way with something that sounds so cool and
[00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:56.940]   so new, but rather coming to be engaged, to be disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ, striving
[00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:01.140]   as we rest in him to follow him in all that he has commanded.
[00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:08.740]   Yeah, that's a good word. The sermon is not offering up new novelties. They are an encounter
[00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:14.260]   with the affections of our hearer's hearts. It's the word confronting hearts. That's so
[00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:19.540]   right, so good. I'm not a huge fan of theologian Karl Barth, but he was once asked if one of
[00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:24.140]   his sermons that he was preaching could be recorded and then released as an audio recording
[00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:29.340]   later. And he said, "Yes, as long as the whole service was recorded and released along with
[00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:36.300]   it too." That sounds foreign to us because we're rather used to abstracted sermon recordings
[00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:42.300]   pulled out. But his point is that really every sermon is part of a broader worship experience,
[00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:45.820]   and it should feel a little weird to us extracted from that.
[00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:52.060]   I think you're exactly right, Tony, and I think that he was onto something. I don't
[00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:58.060]   distribute my sermons. I never have these many years. They're not online. Our people
[00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:02.900]   at St. Andrew's Chapel can get copies of the sermons from the week before if they were
[00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:09.100]   absent, that sort of thing. But the only way I would go about ever letting my sermons be
[00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:13.140]   out there in public, because our sermons are for our people. I'm not against other people
[00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:19.020]   doing it. I get it. I really get it. I understand it. I get the reasoning behind it. I think
[00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:24.140]   there's something special that the Holy Spirit is doing through that local church pastor
[00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:31.180]   with his people that he's striving to shepherd faithfully. And so it would really only be
[00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:36.340]   something that I think would be allowed if it was the entirety of the worship service,
[00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:42.220]   and then maybe online through password for our people at our website, that sort of thing.
[00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:47.180]   Yeah, that's worth thinking about for local churches, for sure. So people say, yes, the
[00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:52.260]   sermon should affectionately influence people. So you had the lecture on one side, but a
[00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:58.900]   novelty for curious eyes of spectators and auditors, that's on the other hand. How do
[00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:05.180]   we protect the sermon from the form of preaching that's merely trying to get some emotional
[00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:10.700]   response from the audience? How do you push against the sort of preaching as emotional
[00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:13.140]   story time kind of a sermon?
[00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:17.220]   Well said, and a very good point. Well, I think it's very important that we establish
[00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:23.660]   at the very outset that sermons must be filled with teaching, filled with exposition, filled
[00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:29.740]   with explanation, looking at the original audience, looking at the context of what's
[00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:34.900]   being said by the Lord and His word. And we really need to spend a great deal of time
[00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:40.220]   not only looking at words, not only looking at phrases, looking at all the doctrine within
[00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:46.980]   that verse or that passage and expounding as much as we possibly can. So sermons need
[00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:52.340]   to be, of course, as we all agree, I'm sure, need to be filled with the explanation and
[00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:59.140]   exposition of scripture. But it's not just tacking on a little application at the end
[00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:04.020]   that causes people to think about something. It's not just sort of throwing on a little
[00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:11.500]   imperative here and there, but rather helping people see how the gospel relates to every
[00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:16.940]   aspect of our sermon and every aspect of what the word of God is teaching them. And at the
[00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:26.220]   same time, how it is they're able to understand the gospel through scripture and the imperatives
[00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:32.860]   that come in light of the gospel. And so to your point regarding sermons that are just
[00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:40.460]   filled with stories or filled with illustrations and really lacking the important content and
[00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:44.600]   exposition of the passage, well, the truth of the matter is they're not really feeding
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:48.060]   their people. They're not feeding their people with the word of God. And that's the only
[00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:53.820]   way God's people are really going to be nourished. And so I think they know that. I think they're
[00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:59.180]   usually typically interested more in sort of attracting more people and getting more
[00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:03.940]   people and not offending too many people because the word of God, when it's preached, it will
[00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:08.980]   not only comfort, it will not only encourage, it will also rebuke and challenge and it will
[00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:13.300]   make people uncomfortable. We know that. And so I think too often they're filling their
[00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:18.780]   time with stories and illustrations simply because it's a little bit easier and it doesn't
[00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:23.140]   really offend anybody. But we are called, as you know, in the preaching of the word
[00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:29.420]   of God to rebuke and to reprove and to exhort and also to comfort and to encourage as we
[00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:34.300]   point people to the gospel of Jesus Christ and our justification in him.
[00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:38.900]   - Very good, Burke. Thank you. Well, speaking of the end and aim of preaching, that's the
[00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:44.220]   topic of John Piper's new book titled Expository Exaltation, the capstone of his new 1000-page
[00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:48.940]   trilogy. And I feel compelled to plug it here. It seems like a good place to do it. The trilogy
[00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:53.580]   answers three critical questions. Question number one, can we trust the Bible? That was
[00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:58.020]   answered in book number one, which is titled A Peculiar Glory. And then question number
[00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:02.620]   two, how should I go about reading the Bible to get God's meaning from it? That was answered
[00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:07.620]   in book number two, Reading the Bible Supernaturally. And finally, question three, what should I
[00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:12.660]   expect from my church and my pastors when they proclaim this book to me? That's answered
[00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:18.140]   in book three, now out, entitled Expository Exaltation, Christian Preaching as Worship.
[00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:22.500]   Well, we are going to return with Burke Parsons on Friday. Burke serves as senior pastor of
[00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:27.900]   St. Andrew's Chapel in Sanford, Florida, a church founded in 1997 by R.C. Sproul. And
[00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:34.260]   R.C., of course, passed away into glory 38 weeks ago, back on December 14th. On Friday,
[00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:38.140]   I'm going to ask Burke to explain the legacy of R.C. on his ministry and what it's like
[00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:42.900]   for him now pastoring without his friend. That's next time. I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:43.380]   We'll see you then.
[00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:44.380]   [END]
[00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:45.380]   R.C. Sproul, Senior Pastor of St. Andrew's Chapel in Sanford, Florida, a church founded
