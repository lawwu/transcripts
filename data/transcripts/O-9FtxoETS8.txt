[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.180]   We have a question here from groupmate.
[00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:15.300]   Groupmate asks, how do you effectively manage group projects in college?
[00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:23.300]   You don't, you know, groupmate, group projects in college are pretty
[00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.060]   hit or miss, usually pretty bad.
[00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.620]   You elaborate here that because you're a Cal Newport type, you
[00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:32.420]   are organized and therefore you basically end up doing a lot more
[00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:37.180]   work because you're not on board with the typical college strategy of,
[00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.680]   Hey, this is due tomorrow.
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.800]   Why don't we stay up all night and do something kind of crappy.
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.720]   You actually want to plan your workout in advance.
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.180]   And so you end up doing most of the work.
[00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.660]   That is the price you pay to have your act together in college.
[00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.740]   You're not going to love group work.
[00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:58.260]   The only two pieces of advice I can give is a avoid it when you can, because
[00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.300]   it's not going to go well for you.
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.280]   B, work with the very best people you can.
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.940]   I mean, I remember having this experience as an undergraduate computer science
[00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:14.140]   student with problem set groups, and I was good at computer science.
[00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.380]   I'll put this the humble way.
[00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.560]   I was good at computer sciences, as you might've predicted based
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.720]   on my later career trajectory.
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.200]   I learned pretty quickly that there was a lot of people who wanted to be in
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.180]   problem set groups with me because they would get all the right answers.
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.640]   It wasn't very useful to me though.
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.840]   Right.
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.380]   I would basically just do the work.
[00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.900]   And eventually I found one or two students who were really smart.
[00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.400]   And these were the students I would come back to, to work with again and again.
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.000]   And we complimented each other and it made these problem set groups really effective.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.720]   I actually got a note like a year or two ago.
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:48.620]   It was actually pretty cool.
[00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.320]   I'd forgotten about it, but it was a group mate I worked with in a lot of courses.
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.780]   I really liked working with, and he came across on my writing or something recently.
[00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.860]   So this is, you know, 15, 16 years later.
[00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.300]   And he sent me a note about, Hey, I remember working on problem
[00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.760]   sets with you back at, back at college.
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:04.520]   So that was pretty cool.
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.080]   Um, and, but that was really useful.
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.360]   So pick the smartest people, the most organized people you can, when you
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.080]   can avoid group projects when you can't.
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.880]   And when all that else fails, I'm just going to validate your frustration.
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.000]   I'm not a big fan of group projects in college.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.320]   And so you're not doing anything wrong.
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.560]   It's just kind of the price you pay.
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.060]   Yeah.
