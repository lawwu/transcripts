[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.200]   In the spirit of that hymn, I should like to call your attention this morning to the
[00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:12.280]   words which are to be found in the first epistle of Peter, the first chapter, and verses 6
[00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:19.120]   and 7. Verses 6 and 7 in the first chapter of the first epistle of Peter.
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:27.440]   Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:35.000]   through many full temptations, that the trial of your faith, being much more precious than
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.640]   of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:50.240]   honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ.
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:56.000]   Now those of us who meet here regularly Sunday by Sunday will realize exactly why I am calling
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.800]   your attention to these verses this morning. We are considering and have been considering
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:09.700]   for a number of Sunday mornings what may be described as spiritual depression, the case
[00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:19.000]   of Christian people who are unhappy, even perhaps miserable. And we have been at pains
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.400]   to consider and to analyze the various causes of that condition as they are outlined in
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:31.640]   the scriptures and as we know them in experience. And our consideration of the theme has not
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:39.160]   been determined by some morbid interest in ourselves and in our varied conditions, but
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:45.480]   rather by the desire to discover the New Testament answer, the New Testament treatment, antidote,
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.240]   cure for such a state.
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:55.080]   And constantly I have been reminding you, and I do so again this morning, that we should
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.680]   be concerned to be delivered from this condition if we have experienced it or are experiencing
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:08.680]   it, and not merely for our own sakes, though that is important, but still more, because
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:14.000]   we believe, as the scripture teaches us, that the world finally will judge the Lord Jesus
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:22.160]   Christ and God himself by what it sees in us. We are the light of the world. We are
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:29.400]   like a city set upon a hill. And men rightly, in a sense, judge the Christian faith and
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:36.840]   the Christian gospel by what they see in us. Therefore, we see at once that this depressed
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:43.960]   condition of so many Christian people, probably more than any other single factor, accounts
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.760]   for the condition of the Christian church today and for the fact that the masses of
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.000]   the people are outside and in the world.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.920]   Well, now, having considered many, many reasons, we come to the particular reason with which
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:03.360]   the apostle deals in this particular section. There is no question at all that the only
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:09.960]   real object that Peter had in writing this letter at all was to deal with this very state.
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:15.640]   So he comes to his theme at once. He starts by reminding these people of certain things,
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.880]   and then he at once comes to his theme. He has been talking about the great salvation,
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.000]   "Blessed be God the Father, God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.720]   to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again into a lively hope by the resurrection of
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:38.880]   Jesus Christ from the dead to this glorious inheritance wherein," he says, "ye greatly
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:49.920]   rejoice. Though now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations."
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:58.640]   Now, there you see is his description of these people. They greatly rejoice in this blessed
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:08.400]   hope, and yet they are in heaviness through manifold temptations. Now again, as we have
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:14.040]   found so many times, this description of these people seems to be quite contradictory. He
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.880]   is describing people who at one and the same time are greatly rejoicing and yet are in
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:24.400]   heaviness. And yet, as we have seen again so often, there is nothing contradictory about
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:32.000]   this. You can, if you like, call it paradoxical, but it is not contradictory. Indeed, the whole
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.840]   case which is made out for the Christian in the New Testament seems always ever to include
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:43.320]   these two elements. At one and the same time, these Christian people to whom the apostle
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:51.000]   writes are greatly rejoicing and are also in heaviness.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.480]   Now this is something again which we must be very clear about before we proceed any
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:04.720]   further. There is a superficial view of Christianity which would regard this as quite impossible.
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:10.240]   The kind of Christian view or the view of the Christian life which simply says that
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:16.240]   "all its problems have gone and now I am happy all the day," of course, cannot accept
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:22.920]   this for a moment. It would say that any Christians who are in heaviness are perhaps doubtful
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:29.240]   as being Christian at all. There is that view which seems to think that the Christian life,
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:36.600]   once one has arrived at a decision or once one has been converted, is one with no troubles
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:41.400]   at all, no ripple on the surface of the sea of life, but everything is perfectly happy,
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.560]   without any problems at all. Now the simple answer to that, of course, is that that is
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:50.920]   not New Testament Christianity. That is the kind of thing, of course, that the cults are
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:56.480]   always offering. That is the kind of thing psychology always offers. That is the mark
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:02.640]   of the spurious. Oh, there is nothing for which one should finally thank God so much
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:10.560]   as the honesty of the Scriptures. They give us the simple truth about ourselves and our
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:16.440]   life in this world. And therefore I say we have to start by realizing that this is something
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:21.720]   that is almost postulated of the Christian. Now let's be clear about this. This word
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:29.040]   "heaviness" which the apostle uses here, it really means to be grieved. It means that
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:33.000]   they are troubled. It is not merely that they have to suffer certain things, but that the
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.280]   suffering of these things really does grieve them, that they are troubled about it, that
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:46.960]   they really are made unhappy by these things. So Peter describes these persons as showing
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:51.600]   these two characteristics at one and the same time, the great rejoicing and yet the being
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:58.360]   grieved. Now you will find that, I say, so commonly in the Scriptures. Take, for instance,
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:04.280]   a perfect example of it all. There is a series of paradoxes which the apostle Paul has in
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:08.680]   describing himself in the second epistle to the Corinthians, the fourth chapter. He gives
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:13.560]   us quite a list of them. "We are troubled on every side," he says, "yet not distressed.
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:19.400]   We are perplexed but not in despair, persecuted but not forsaken, cast down but not destroyed,
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:25.040]   always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus," and so on. Statements
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:31.320]   which appear to be mutually exclusive at first, but which are not. They are just a
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:36.720]   part of the paradox of the Christian life. And this is the amazing thing about the Christian,
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:40.840]   that at one and the same time he really does experience these two things.
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:46.960]   Well, then, sir, someone, if that is so, where lies the problem? Well, the problem, of course,
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:55.400]   lies here, that we fail to maintain the balance, and that we tend to allow this heaviness,
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:08:02.400]   this grieving to overwhelm us, and rarely to get us down. "Cast down," says the apostle,
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:07.480]   "but not destroyed." Well, the danger is that it may destroy us, that it may, as it
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:13.160]   were, keep us down. Not merely that we are temporarily upset by it, but that it really
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:17.880]   may become a prevailing mood, and we can never get rid of it, and that as other people look
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:23.400]   at us, they are more conscious of the grieved, heavy condition than they are of this great
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:26.720]   rejoicing.
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:33.440]   In other words, we have to realize and to remember that the Christian, according to
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:42.160]   the New Testament, is not unnatural. The Christian is not one who has become immune to what is
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:46.960]   happening round and about him. Now, I say that that's a great principle in the New
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:53.600]   Testament, because we need to emphasize it, because there are certain Christian people,
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:58.240]   again I say, who really have got a notion and a conception of the Christian life which
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:06.400]   makes the Christian quite unnatural. For instance, grief and sorrow are something to which the
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:12.680]   Christian is still subject. And there is a sense in which I am prepared to argue that
[00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:18.360]   the absence of a feeling of grief in a Christian is not a recommendation for the Christian
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:26.560]   faith. It is unnatural. It goes beyond the New Testament. It favors more of the stoical,
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:30.040]   or again I say, of the psychological.
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:34.120]   There is nothing which is more grand, as you go through the Scriptures, as to see the saints
[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:40.520]   of God yet subject to human feelings. They know grief and sorrow. They know what it is
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:45.920]   to feel lonely. They know what it is to be disappointed. All these things I here describe,
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:49.680]   you will see them in the life of the Apostle Paul, perhaps more than anywhere else. He
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:56.880]   was subject to all these things, and he doesn't conceal it. He says that when he arrived at
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:04.720]   Troas he was troubled. Without were fighting, he says, within were fears. That's the Apostle.
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:09.840]   He's still a very human person, though he had such amazing faith, and though he had
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:16.440]   such exalted experiences in his communion with his blessed Lord.
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:20.960]   Very well then, I say, these things can be found at one and the same time, and the Christian
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:29.040]   must never regard himself as one who is unnatural in that sense. He has something that enables
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:33.280]   him to rise above all these things. Yes, but the glory of the Christian life is that you
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:39.920]   rise above them and yet feel them. It isn't an absence of feeling. And there, I say, is
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:41.640]   the most important dividing line.
[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:47.440]   Well, now, let us, having laid down that postulate, go on to consider why it is that the Christian
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:54.920]   should thus be in heaviness, in this grieved condition. And the answer is, of course, these
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:11:01.920]   many full temptations. Now, there's no doubt here that the better word would be trials.
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:09.880]   These people were like this because they were passing through manifold trials. Now, that's
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:14.880]   an interesting word, that word manifold, isn't it? It's obviously a favorite word with the
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:24.720]   Apostle Peter, because he uses it later on concerning the grace of God. It means, of
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:34.880]   course, many-colored. It means that kind of variegated condition. Life like a dome of
[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:40.480]   many-colored glass, says the poet. Well, it's something like that, you see, that there is
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:45.920]   the dome with the different shades and colors of glass, and the light of the sun comes through,
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:50.400]   and we see these varied colors. That's the meaning of this word manifold. And the Apostle
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:55.640]   says that these people are grieved, they're troubled, and they're in heaviness because
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:12:02.840]   they are experiencing these manifold trials. They come in different ways, in different
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:08.440]   colors, in different shapes and forms. In a sense, there's no end at all to the variety.
[00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:14.200]   Well, what are these trials? What's he thinking about? Well, in this very epistle, he makes
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:20.440]   it quite clear as to what he has in mind. Many of these Christians were being persecuted.
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:26.360]   "Dearly beloved," he says in the second chapter, "I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims,
[00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:31.200]   abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul, having your conversation honest
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:38.320]   among the Gentiles, that whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:46.280]   good works which they shall behold glorify God in the day of visitation." The Christian,
[00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:51.960]   because he's a Christian, is subject to this kind of thing in this world, because he's
[00:12:51.960 --> 00:13:01.480]   a new man, because he's born again. He's inevitably bound to be misunderstood. He's a stranger,
[00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:07.480]   he's a pilgrim. And he is like a stranger in a strange land. He's got a different type
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:12.040]   of life, he's got different ideas and customs, and the other people are looking on, and they
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:15.200]   notice the difference and they don't like it, and they make it very plain to him that
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:21.160]   they dislike it. These people were subject to persecutions and trials that came in that
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:27.320]   way. We are given many accounts of these trials in the New Testament. I needn't keep you
[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:35.360]   with that. But the saints of God have always had to meet this kind of thing. The apostle
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:42.000]   Paul indeed goes so far in writing to Timothy as to use a phrase like this, "Yea, he says,
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:50.560]   they that are godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecutions." Now this is a law, according
[00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:57.640]   to the Scripture. The more we approximate to the Lord Jesus Christ in our life and living,
[00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:07.440]   the more likely we are to get troubles in this world. Look at him, who did no evil,
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:15.320]   no guile was found in his mouth. He spent his time in healing people, doing good, preaching.
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:19.480]   And yet look at the opposition, look at the trials that he had to endure. Why? Well, simply
[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:25.400]   because he was what he was. The world in its heart of hearts hates the Christ, it hates
[00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:31.040]   the Christian. Because, of course, such holy living condemns it, and it doesn't like that.
[00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:34.880]   It's made to feel uncomfortable by it. And it's on the defensive, it reacts at once.
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:38.840]   "Here it is," says the apostle, "I know that you're experiencing that. They're speaking
[00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:43.120]   against you as evildoers even, simply because you're not doing what they're doing." He goes
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:48.920]   on in the fourth chapter to put it like this, still more specifically. He says, "The time
[00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:53.600]   past of your life may suffice to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when he walked in
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:59.840]   lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revelings, banqueting, and abominable idolatries." Listen.
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:05.120]   "Wherein they think it strange that he run not with them to the same excess of riots
[00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:12.040]   still, speaking evil of you." You see, these people, the world was annoyed with these people
[00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:16.360]   because they'd given up that sort of life and were living this Christian life. And at
[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:20.640]   once they got into trouble. People who'd been very friendly towards them now began to look
[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:24.840]   at them and didn't smile any longer at them, were obviously criticizing them, said things
[00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:29.720]   about them to others. That was the thing that was causing this grieved condition. They were
[00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:36.100]   in heaviness because of this thing. And I say it is something that the Christian has
[00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:42.780]   had to endure throughout the centuries, this misunderstanding on the part of other people.
[00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:47.000]   And it becomes still more difficult when it happens to be someone who may be very near
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:53.320]   and dear to you or someone whom you've loved. When a Christian finds himself or herself
[00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:58.240]   perhaps the only Christian in a family, this kind of thing happens. And for a Christian
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:02.200]   not to be grieved by it means, I say again, that there's something radically wrong with
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:10.720]   him. One should be troubled by these things, and these people were being troubled. The
[00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:15.120]   Apostle Paul constantly was in this position. Notice how he tells us, "Thou must have
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:20.360]   forsaken me." That wasn't a light thing to Paul. He was troubled by it. He was grieved
[00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:25.760]   by it. He had to stand on his trial absolutely alone. People whom he thought he could rely
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:30.560]   upon suddenly fell away from him, and there he stands alone. "No man stood with me,"
[00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:39.600]   he says. That's the kind of thing that grieves the Christian. Or you have read the lives
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:45.920]   of the saints, oh, almost at random to find this very thing. Read your journals of John
[00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:50.960]   Wesley. You'll find he constantly was in this condition because of some misunderstanding
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:55.640]   or something like that. The latest example, perhaps on a big scale in this country, is
[00:16:55.640 --> 00:17:02.200]   to be found in the life of Charles Haddon Spurgeon. When he started his famous downgrade
[00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:07.800]   movement, when he saw the apostasy that was coming in and the worldliness that was invading
[00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:13.960]   the churches, and he stood against it, men whom he had regarded as friends, many of whom
[00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:18.960]   he trained in his own college for nothing, suddenly fell away from him. You have but
[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:26.120]   to read his account of all this to see how he was hurt and grieved, how he was in heaviness,
[00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:30.640]   because men on whom he felt he could rely suddenly failed him. I say you can read it
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:36.280]   almost at random. I was reading in the journals of George Whitefield only this very week,
[00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:43.680]   this very thing. Whitefield had had a season of exceptional nearness to Christ, and he
[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:48.400]   was rejoicing in it, but he makes a note in his journal. He says, "How strange that
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:52.120]   I should have had this after that terrible period of heaviness through which I had just
[00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:57.360]   passed." And no doubt, he says, "I shall be subject to that again." He knew it.
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:03.480]   It was his experience. It is, I say, the inevitable luck of the men of God in a world and in a
[00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:09.520]   life such as this because of sin. Well, very well then, here are these Christians with
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:16.960]   these manifold trials. Oh, let it be quite comprehensive. It means anything in this life
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:24.040]   and in this world that tends to trouble you and to get you down, something that touches
[00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:31.240]   you in the most sensitive and delicate part of your being, in your heart, in your mind,
[00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:38.600]   in your sensibility. These are the things that tend to cast us down. Very well. What
[00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:42.760]   does the apostle do about it? What is his way of dealing with this kind of thing? Well,
[00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:47.760]   it is most interesting, and it is what you and I must do, my friends, if we are to maintain
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:55.480]   this twofold aspect of our Christian life. If we are to go on greatly rejoicing in spite
[00:18:55.480 --> 00:19:00.840]   of the things that grieve us, we must approach them and face them all in the way that the
[00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:04.480]   apostle here instructs us. Well, what is the teaching? Well, the first thing is he lays
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:11.080]   down a great principle. And the great principle is that we must understand why these things
[00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:19.800]   happen to us. That is the first thing. Oh, how often do we need to say this to ourselves
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:25.460]   and to one another. I sometimes think the whole art of Christian living is the art of
[00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:31.720]   asking questions. The danger is, of course, we allow things to come upon us and we just
[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:36.520]   drop to the ground without saying anything, except that we say, "Alas and aleck, and
[00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:40.400]   why do these things happen to me, and why does God allow them?" Now, that is not the
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:46.260]   way. The thing to do, says the apostle, is to discover, if you can, why these things
[00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:53.640]   are taking place, to understand why they happen to us. And here he uses the following terms.
[00:19:53.640 --> 00:20:00.000]   "Wherein," he says, "he greatly rejoiced, though now for a season, then"—listen—"if
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:08.120]   need be"—ah, that's the secret. What does he mean by this "if need be"? Well,
[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:14.120]   there is no doubt about the answer to that. It's a conditional statement. You can translate
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:21.480]   it, if you like, like this. "Though now for a season, if such proves needful"—that's
[00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:30.240]   it—"if such proves needful," it doesn't mean, it isn't merely a general statement
[00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:35.320]   to the effect, "Well, in a world like this, these things must happen." It isn't that.
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:40.120]   It's much stronger than that. He isn't saying, "Well, you are greatly rejoicing
[00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:45.880]   in this blessed hope, though of course in a world like this you may have to endure certain
[00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:50.680]   things." That's all right, that's perfectly true, that's a truism. But the apostle doesn't
[00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:55.880]   merely leave it at that. He's got a positive statement here. He says, "You are at the
[00:20:55.880 --> 00:21:03.120]   moment enduring this grief because it has proved needful to you that you should do so."
[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:12.680]   Now, then, there's a doctrine. There's a definite purpose in all this, says the apostle.
[00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:20.660]   This kind of thing doesn't happen accidentally. This is not something that just takes place
[00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:26.960]   because of the whole organization in life. That's a reason in a sense, but it isn't
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:36.920]   the main reason. These things happen, says the apostle, because they're good for us,
[00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:43.040]   because they're a part of our discipline in this life and in this world, because—let
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:49.720]   me put it quite plainly and bluntly—because God has appointed us to them. That's the
[00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:53.880]   apostles' doctrine, as it is the doctrine of the whole of the New Testament, as it certainly
[00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:59.640]   is the doctrine and the faith of the saints of the centuries.
[00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:04.320]   In other words, we must look at the Christian life like this. We are walking through this
[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:11.980]   life and through this world under the eye of our heavenly Father. It's the fundamental
[00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:18.400]   thing the Christian must grasp. I am in a peculiar relationship to God, which is not
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:24.040]   true of anybody who is not a Christian. And there is a very definite plan and purpose
[00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:28.960]   for the whole of my life. God has looked upon me, God has called me, God has adopted me
[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:36.520]   into his family. What for? Well, that he may bring me to perfection. That's his object.
[00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:41.080]   He is fashioning me that I may be more and more conformable to the image of his dear
[00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:49.120]   Son. That is what he is doing. The Lord Jesus Christ is bringing many sons unto glory. So
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:53.800]   he says, "Behold me and the children that thou hast given me." Now, if we don't
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:57.800]   start with that fundamental conception of ourselves as Christians, we are bound to go
[00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:03.960]   astray and we are certain to misunderstand these things.
[00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:09.400]   The doctrine, therefore, of the Scripture is that God at least permits these things
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:18.080]   to happen to us. I go further. God at times orders these things to happen to us. And that
[00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:26.560]   is, I say, for our good. He may do it sometimes in order indeed to chastise us, to chastise
[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:31.800]   us for our slackness and for our failure. We were looking together last Sunday morning
[00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:36.600]   at the failure of the Christian to discipline himself. Peter there in the second epistle
[00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:41.800]   is exhorting Christians to discipline themselves to add to their faith, to furnish out their
[00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:47.960]   faith, to fill out their faith, not merely to be content with faith but let it be a full-orbed,
[00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:58.360]   blooming faith. Well, we may pay no heed to that exhortation. We may persist in our slackness
[00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:03.360]   and in our indolence. Well, as I understand the New Testament doctrine, my friend, if
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:10.040]   you do that, don't be surprised if things begin to happen to you. Don't be surprised
[00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:14.400]   if God begins to chastise you. The argument of the twelfth of Hebrews is as strong as
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:18.480]   this, isn't it? That if you are children, well, then you are certain to be chastised.
[00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:24.200]   Whom the Lord loveth, he chasteneth. There is no more terrible state for a person to
[00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:30.320]   be in than that in which he has never experienced any chastisement. If you've known no chastisement,
[00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:34.360]   my friend, I should seriously doubt whether you've ever been a Christian at all. If you
[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:39.520]   say to me that since you believed you've never had any troubles at all, I say that's psychological,
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:49.000]   it's not spiritual. There is a realism about this Christianity, as I said at the beginning,
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:55.240]   and it goes so far as to teach that God for our good will bring us down. If we pay no
[00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:59.600]   heed to the exhortations and the appeals of the Scripture, God as his other method, whom
[00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:05.760]   he loveth, he chasteneth. He doesn't do that, says the author there, to those who are bastards,
[00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:09.680]   to those who are illegitimate, who don't really belong to him, but if there is children, he's
[00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:19.800]   certainly going to do it. So we may be experiencing many full trials as a part of our chastisement.
[00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:27.160]   I'm not saying it's invariable, you notice. I say it may be. But then sometimes God does
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:36.000]   this to us in order to prepare us for something. It's a rule of the Scripture, a rule which
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:44.360]   is confirmed by and exemplified in, again, the long history of the church and her saints,
[00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:48.560]   that when God has a particularly great task for a man to perform, he generally does this
[00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:55.840]   to him first. I don't care which biography you pick up again. You take the life of any
[00:25:55.840 --> 00:26:00.720]   man who's been signally used by God, you'll generally find there's been a preliminary
[00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:06.600]   period of very severe testing and humbling and trial. Well, yes, of course, because God
[00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:10.640]   couldn't dare, would not dare as it were, to use such a man unless he can be certain
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:15.600]   and sure of him. So a man may have to pass through this kind of experience because of
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:21.560]   some great task. Look at Joseph, for instance. Look at the things that happened to Joseph.
[00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:26.200]   Can you imagine a more dismal kind of life, an unhappier kind of life? Everybody against
[00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:30.280]   him, his own brothers jealous of him, they sell him, they get rid of him, and there he
[00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:34.400]   goes to Egypt and there people turn against him. He's done nothing wrong, but because
[00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:40.040]   of the sin of others he finds himself in prison, cast down. What's it all mean? Well, God
[00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:45.480]   is only preparing the men for that great position that he had in store for him. And it's the
[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:52.160]   same with all of them. Look at the sufferings of a man like David. Oh, I say, you look at
[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:56.960]   any one of them and you'll find that their lives, as it were, were surrounded by these
[00:26:56.960 --> 00:27:01.680]   trials and difficulties. Look at the Apostle Paul. Look at the lists he gives of his sufferings
[00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:08.080]   and his trials. It's always been like that. But you know, it seems clear also from the
[00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:16.320]   teaching of the Scripture and the lives of the saints that God sometimes prepares a man
[00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:24.040]   for a great trial in this way. What I mean is that he prepares him by giving him some
[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:32.480]   lesser trials. Oh, it's there I see the love of God shining out so gloriously. There are
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:38.160]   certain great trials that come in life. And it would be a terrible thing sometimes for
[00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:45.160]   certain people suddenly to be plunged into the great trial from an undisturbed, even
[00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:50.400]   tenor of their ways. So God sometimes in his tenderness and in his love, he sends lesser
[00:27:50.400 --> 00:28:00.160]   trials to prepare them for the greater trials. If need be, if such proves needful, if God
[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:06.160]   looking upon us as our Father sees that that is just what we need at that moment. So very
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:15.800]   well we start, I say, by this great principle that God sees and knows all. We think we know
[00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:21.520]   what's best for us and what is needful, but we don't. But God always does. And there
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:27.320]   is our heavenly Father. He sees the need and he prescribes the appropriate trial. It's
[00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:31.440]   all designed for our good. That's the first principle. Let me hurry to the second, which
[00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:40.740]   is this. It is the precious character of faith. That, he says in the seventh verse, these
[00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:45.920]   things happen to you, these many full trials, that in order that the trial of your faith
[00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:51.600]   being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:57.600]   be found unto praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ. How important
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:07.260]   this is. The precious character of faith. And he brings that out with his comparison.
[00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:14.880]   Look at gold, says the apostle. Gold is precious, but it's not as precious as faith. And how
[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:22.200]   does he establish that? Well, he says gold is something that ultimately is going to perish.
[00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:29.760]   Gold is finally only temporary. The erosion which takes place in nature is gradually destroying
[00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:35.480]   it and removing it. It can actually be destroyed by fire if the fire goes too far. There's
[00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:42.800]   nothing permanent about gold, though it's very wonderful and very precious. But faith
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:52.720]   is eternal. Gold perisheth, but faith doesn't perish. Faith is something that is everlasting
[00:29:52.720 --> 00:30:00.520]   and eternal in its very nature and in its very constitution. And the thing by which
[00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:04.400]   you live, says the apostle, and the thing that accounts for your being in the Christian
[00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:11.680]   life is that you are in this faith position and this faith condition. And you don't realize,
[00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:16.440]   says the apostle, what a marvelous and what a wonderful thing it is. Your rebirth and
[00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:21.720]   all these things, they have become real and actual and experimental to you as the result
[00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:27.320]   of this faith. We walk by faith, we stand by faith, the whole of our life is a matter
[00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:34.880]   of faith. And you see, says the apostle, this is so precious in the sight of God, it's
[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:41.320]   so marvelous, it's so wonderful, that God wants this to be absolutely pure. You purify
[00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:46.120]   your gold by means of fire, you get rid of the alloys, you get rid of the amalgam, you
[00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:50.160]   get rid of that which is not pure gold by putting your gold in the crucible and you
[00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:57.480]   put your flame under it and these other things are removed and the gold remains. And his
[00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:03.940]   argument is this, that if you do that with gold that perisheth, how much more so does
[00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:12.440]   it need to be done for faith? Because faith is this extraordinary principle which links
[00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:18.360]   a man to God. Faith is this thing that takes a man from hell and puts him in heaven. It's
[00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:23.320]   the difference between the world, this world and the world to come. Faith is this mystic,
[00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:29.480]   marvelous, astounding thing that can bring a man who is dead in trespasses and sins alive
[00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:35.360]   as a new being and a new man in Christ Jesus. It's so precious. Well, it's so precious
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:43.680]   that God wants it absolutely perfect. That's his argument. So you're in these many temptations
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:50.940]   because of the character of faith. But let me put that in a slightly different form by
[00:31:50.940 --> 00:32:00.800]   putting it like this. Our faith, you see, needs to be perfected. There are degrees of
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:10.760]   faith. There are differences in the quality of faith. Faith is great and many-sided. And
[00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:14.880]   there is generally at the beginning a good deal of admixture in what we call our faith.
[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:19.880]   There's a great deal of the flesh that we're not aware of. We begin to learn these things
[00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:25.280]   as we go on. And the process that God puts you through, says the apostle, is this testing
[00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:30.400]   by trials, as by fire, as it were, in order that that which doesn't really belong to
[00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:38.000]   the essence of faith may fall off. And how does it work? Well, I think it works like
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:47.320]   this and how obvious it is when you come to look at it. Take the trust element in faith.
[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:51.760]   We think at first that our faith is perfect, that we can stand up against anything. Then
[00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:58.120]   a trial comes and we find that we've fallen. Well, that's just an indication that the
[00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:05.000]   trust element in our faith needs to be developed. And God develops the trust element in our
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:10.160]   faith by trying us in this way. And the more we experience these things, the more we learn
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:15.240]   to trust God. We only trust him at first when he's smiling upon us and when the sun is
[00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:19.320]   shining in the heavens. But a day comes when the clouds have gathered and we can't see
[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:23.520]   the face of God and the smile of God. And we say, "Does God love us any longer? Is
[00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:27.840]   this Christian life true?" Ah, you see, your faith hadn't developed the element of
[00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:37.400]   trust. And God so deals with us in this life and in this world as to bring us to trust
[00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:44.440]   him in the very dark, when we can see no light at all, when all things seem against us, to
[00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:52.040]   drive us to despair, we still know that one gate is open. One hour shall hear our prayer.
[00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:56.200]   That's the faith, that's the trust. Look at a man like Abraham. God had so dealt with
[00:33:56.200 --> 00:34:00.200]   him that he hoped against hope. When there was no hope, he believed. He stood on the
[00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:06.200]   word of God. He trusted him absolutely. When every appearance was to the contrary. Well,
[00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:15.040]   I know that needs to be developed in us. We don't start like that. But as we go through
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:23.240]   these experiences and find that behind a frowning providence he hides a father's face, the
[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:28.880]   next time the trials come, we remain calm and collected and cool. We say, "Yes, I
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:35.560]   know. I don't see the sun, but I know it's there. I know that behind the clouds the face
[00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:40.960]   of God is looking upon me." And it's by means of these trials that that element of
[00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:48.560]   trust is developed, and likewise with the element of patience. Patience is a great constituent
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:59.080]   in faith. Patient endurance, the sheer capacity to go on and to keep on in spite of discouragement,
[00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:05.440]   it's one of the greatest tests of the Christian and of his faith. We are all impatient at
[00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:10.880]   first. We start as children in the Christian life, and we want everything at once when
[00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:14.920]   we think it should come. And we want all of it together, but it doesn't come. And then
[00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:22.160]   we become impatient, and we grumble and we complain, and we sulk like children. We are
[00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:29.040]   lacking in patience and in patient endurance. Oh, there's nothing that is more emphasized
[00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:36.760]   in these New Testament epistles than just that quality, just to keep on, whatever's
[00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:42.000]   happening. Whether men smile upon you or frown upon you, just go on because you're pleasing
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:47.960]   God. Whether you get every blessing you've craved for and have pleaded for or not, you
[00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:52.920]   still go on. You say, "God knows what's best for me. I'm still going on. I trust
[00:35:52.920 --> 00:36:00.080]   in God, and I'll patiently endure even though he slay me. Yet will I trust him?" Patient
[00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:08.560]   endurance, keep on. And it is as we are tried and tested by these things that all these
[00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:14.960]   other elements which go to make up faith become developed and are perfected.
[00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:23.400]   Or let me put it in my last general principle in this way. "These trials are essential,"
[00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:32.240]   says Peter, "in order to show the genuineness of our faith." His phrase is that the trial
[00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:39.880]   of your faith. Now, "trial" there means the attestation of. You see, the picture he's
[00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:45.680]   got there is of a test being applied to anything, especially to precious metals. And then after
[00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:50.840]   they've been tested, the certificate is given. Yes, it's 18 carat gold. That's it. That's
[00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:55.600]   what he means by the trial. He's really not interested in the process of trial as in the
[00:36:55.600 --> 00:37:01.840]   certificate of attestation. The trial of your faith, the genuineness of your faith, the
[00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:07.440]   approved character of your faith may be made manifest. That's why these things, he says,
[00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:17.760]   come to you. And again, this is quite obvious, isn't it? It's the way that we endure trials
[00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:27.160]   that really certifies our faith. You remember our Lord in the parable of the sower? He depicts
[00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:33.120]   the seed of falling amongst thorns. It sprang up at once and there seemed to be a marvelous
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:37.080]   harvest coming. But it didn't come. Why? Well, these other things, they choked the
[00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:42.440]   word and it died. He interprets that as meaning this. Trials and tribulations come and they
[00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:48.760]   crush the man, they choke the word and he dies. He never comes to full fruition. It
[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:52.800]   seemed so wonderful. You'd say, "What a marvelous faith. Look at that man's life."
[00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:57.640]   But the trials proved that it was a spurious faith. It wasn't a real faith. It wasn't
[00:37:57.640 --> 00:38:03.840]   a genuine faith. There's nothing that so certifies the genuineness of a man's faith as his continuance,
[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:13.400]   his patient endurance, his going on steadily in spite of everything. It's the teaching
[00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:21.040]   of our Lord. It's the teaching of the whole of the New Testament. Again, there is nothing
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:27.840]   that is so wonderful in the life of all the greatest saints as just that. How they stood
[00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:33.920]   like rocks when others fell away round and about them. It's the story of the martyrs
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:38.400]   and the great confessors. They didn't compromise with truth or with anybody else. They just
[00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:43.720]   stood on what they knew to be God's truth, whatever the consequences, and they went on.
[00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:48.920]   And their faith shines out gloriously.
[00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:56.400]   These things are happening to you, says Peter, that the genuineness of your faith may be
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:39:04.640]   perfectly evident to all. Fair-weather Christians are no recommendation. Those who start well
[00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:12.080]   but who don't continue, oh, they've never had the real thing. Many are called but few
[00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:19.960]   are chosen. What shows the difference between the appearance and the reality is the capacity
[00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:25.920]   to stand the test. All that glitters is not gold. Well, how do you prove it? Put it into
[00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:31.360]   the crucible and put the flame underneath. You'll know then the genuineness. That's
[00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:38.360]   the way to test it. Put on your acids. Put on all these things that really do test. And
[00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:42.880]   these things happen to us in order that the genuineness of our faith may be outstanding.
[00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:47.200]   Well, now, then, there is his teaching. That's the most important thing of all. But let me
[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:52.760]   just say this. He does give us a word for our encouragement. There's something here
[00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:58.920]   to console us. And we need it. Let me remind you of it. What is the consolation? What is
[00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:03.840]   the encouragement? Well, here it is. These things happen to us, I say, yes, but thank
[00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:11.600]   God they only happen for a season. Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season,
[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:18.640]   if need be. Don't go away with the impression that I'm here to teach that that's the
[00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:30.440]   perpetual condition of the Christian. It isn't. These things come and go as God deems fit.
[00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:35.120]   We will never be tried and tested except it be for our good. It isn't permanent. And
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:40.600]   as we respond to the teaching, God will withdraw the trial. He doesn't keep us permanently
[00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:45.160]   like this. As Whitfield said in the quotation I gave you from his journal, these things
[00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:52.280]   seem to alternate, but God knows exactly how to send them and when to. And you can always
[00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:58.280]   be sure of this in the words of St. Paul, "There is no temptation or trial taken you,
[00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:05.560]   but such as is common to men. But God is kind, who will not suffer you to be tempted above
[00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:10.720]   that which ye are able to bear, but will always also with the temptation provide a way to
[00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:16.760]   escape." He's your loving Father. He knows how much you can take, how much you can stand.
[00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:20.600]   He'll never send too much for you. He knows the right amount and He'll give you the
[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:28.560]   right amount and when you've responded, He'll withdraw it. It's only for a season.
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:35.720]   Am I preaching, I wonder, at this moment to any downcast, heavy-laden Christian? Does
[00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:40.680]   all seem blackness and darkness? Are you not having the liberty you once had in prayer?
[00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:44.560]   Haven't you the feeling within you that you once had? My dear friend, don't be troubled.
[00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:50.040]   Go on. You're in the hands of your Father. There may be a glorious period coming for
[00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:54.480]   you. He's got something in store for you. He may have some unusual blessing for you.
[00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:59.120]   He may have some great work for you. Don't be downcast, I say. It's only for a season,
[00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:04.840]   my dear friend. You're in the hands of your loving Father. Go on, keep on. Say to Him,
[00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:15.560]   "Yes, I'm content only to be in Thy hands, only to do Thy will. My will shall be."
[00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:23.680]   The second thing is this. As we are experiencing this heaviness, make yourself, remind yourself
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:30.960]   also of the things wherein ye greatly rejoice. Now that's something you and I've got to
[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:37.360]   do. You see, when these trials come, we tend to see nothing but the trials. I say, when
[00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:43.400]   the clouds have gathered, we tend to see nothing but clouds. Now then, do this. Just go back
[00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:48.680]   beyond the sixth verse, go back to the third. When you can see nothing at all, well, just
[00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:53.880]   open your Scriptures and start reading this. Though you see nothing at the moment, say,
[00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:59.240]   "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ." I know that's always true,
[00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:04.600]   which according to His abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the
[00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:10.160]   resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled,
[00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:16.120]   and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you, who are kept by the power of God
[00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:23.400]   through faith unto salvation, ready to be revealed in the last time. Remind yourself
[00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:28.200]   of that. Oh yes, these things are happening. These trials are falling upon you thick and
[00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:32.760]   fast. They're coming in all directions. Don't sit down under your juniper tree and say,
[00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:37.760]   "Alas, alack." Stand up rather and say, "Well, these things are happening, but I know that
[00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:43.520]   God is God. I know that Christ came and died for me. I know that I've been born again.
[00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:48.160]   I know that I belong to God, and I know the inheritance is there. I can't see it this
[00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:53.400]   morning. I know it's there, and I know that God is keeping it, and no one will ever take
[00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:59.960]   it out of his mighty hands." Say that to yourself. Remind yourself of the things in which you
[00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:09.160]   greatly rejoice, though for the season, if need be, you are in many full temptations.
[00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:16.400]   And then go on to the ultimate step, which is this, that the trial of your faith being
[00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:25.640]   much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found
[00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:38.520]   unto praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ. That's it. The day of the
[00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:45.880]   revelation of Jesus Christ. It's coming. I don't know when, but I know it's coming, and
[00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:56.600]   I know that I shall be there. And I know, therefore, that all that happens to me in
[00:44:56.600 --> 00:45:06.240]   this life and in this world has that as its ultimate objective. Let him deliver you, just
[00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:15.160]   as you are. Cry out unto him, and he will raise you up out of that horrible pit and
[00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:24.880]   mowery clay, and set your feet upon a rock, and establish your goings, and accompany throughout
[00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:30.520]   the remainder of your life in this world, be with you in the river of death, and hold
[00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:38.240]   up your head above it all and beyond it all, and then beyond, will take you by the hand,
[00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:49.760]   and will present you faultless before the presence of God in glory with exceeding joy.
[00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:52.880]   Amen.
