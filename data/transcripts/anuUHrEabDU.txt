[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.540]   So let's now return to the question of whether or not
[00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.520]   cannabis and its different components increase creativity.
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.820]   And when you look at the literature on this,
[00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.400]   you find studies that very clearly point to a yes,
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.200]   it increases creativity.
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.080]   And it's not surprising therefore,
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.520]   that cannabis can increase dopamine transmission,
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.920]   that is dopamine levels in certain brain areas,
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.300]   in particular brain areas involved in thinking and planning.
[00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.960]   Okay, so cannabis increases dopamine in these areas,
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.560]   elevated dopamine increases divergent thinking,
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.880]   and divergent thinking is associated with creativity.
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.920]   And there are studies that support the idea
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.800]   that cannabis can increase creativity.
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.280]   However, there are at least as many studies
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.320]   that say that cannabis does not increase creativity,
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.640]   that cannabis increases consideration of multiple ideas,
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.400]   perhaps through elevation of dopamine and related systems,
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.120]   but that ultimately the ideas that converge
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.920]   from that are not truly creative ideas,
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.260]   at least they don't meet the criteria
[00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.480]   for creative brainstorming and extraction of ideas
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.680]   that are truly novel.
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.060]   So it doesn't increase creativity.
[00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.600]   So which one is it?
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.520]   Well, fortunately, there's an entirely distinct set
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.000]   of literature that has taken all the other literature
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.880]   into consideration, and here's where we arrive.
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.700]   So there's a really nice study that explored creativity
[00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.120]   in cannabis users.
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.360]   And we will provide a link to this study.
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.120]   First author is Emily LaFrance,
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.720]   and the title of the paper is somewhat amusing
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.360]   in its own right, which is, it starts with a question.
[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.120]   Inspired by Mary Jane, of course,
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.560]   Mary Jane being one of the kind of old school versions
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.960]   of our ways of talking about cannabis or marijuana.
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.200]   Nowadays, people refer to it mainly as pot,
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.960]   as other names too, of course.
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.440]   And the title of the paper is Inspired by Mary Jane,
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.800]   Mechanisms Underlying Enhanced Creativity in Cannabis Users.
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.400]   And I really like this study for a couple of reasons.
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.400]   First of all, they looked at people who did not use cannabis
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.240]   as well as people who use cannabis.
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.480]   So they had two different groups,
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:06.320]   but they did not evaluate creativity of the cannabis users
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.800]   while they were under the influence of cannabis.
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.120]   They looked at the level of creativity
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.120]   in these cannabis users
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.960]   when they were not under the influence of cannabis
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.840]   and asked whether or not their ability to be creative
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.260]   was enhanced by cannabis.
[00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.400]   Now, we're going to compare this to studies
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.480]   in which people come into the laboratory
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.600]   and actually use cannabis,
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.120]   and then they evaluate creativity under that context.
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.240]   But this study has some unique takeaways
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.440]   that I think are really interesting.
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.980]   First of all, they did, yes,
[00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.440]   see evidence for enhanced creativity.
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.940]   And when I say enhanced creativity,
[00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.320]   I mean, within the context of this divergent thinking thing
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.980]   that I talked about a moment ago.
[00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.160]   And when I say enhanced,
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.600]   I mean significantly greater than in non-users,
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.520]   so people that don't use cannabis.
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.640]   So right now I can imagine
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.880]   that all the cannabis users are cheering,
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.760]   yes, cannabis increases creativity,
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.320]   makes people more creative than they would be otherwise.
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.000]   Well, this is interesting.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.520]   We have to ask ourselves how that was accomplished.
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.200]   And it turns out that one of the major ways
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.160]   in which it was accomplished is that cannabis users,
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.600]   even if they are not under the influence of cannabis,
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.240]   are far more open to novel ideas,
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.240]   and they have a more explorative
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.520]   and sort of reduced anxiety,
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.000]   or I should say lower anxiety mode of thinking
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.420]   when they explore novel ideas,
[00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.380]   which is essential for divergent thinking.
[00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.960]   So they observe both enhanced divergent
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.960]   and convergent creative type thinking in cannabis users.
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:38.360]   And the source of that, they conclude, is,
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.080]   and here I'll just quote,
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.840]   "Cannabis users higher levels of openness to experience
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.320]   are responsible for their enhanced self-reported creativity
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.620]   and convergent thinking test performance."
[00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.360]   So it's not necessarily that cannabis is increasing
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.680]   the capacity of the brain areas
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.500]   that are associated with creativity,
[00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.500]   but rather cannabis appears to be increasing an openness,
[00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.040]   and probably doing that in part through lowering anxiety
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.160]   in particular people.
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:10.180]   And that openness is leading to inclusion of more ideas
[00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.720]   during the divergent thinking process, right?
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.880]   They're willing to consider throwing up more things
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.480]   on the wall to see if they stick, so to speak.
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:18.940]   So in their conclusions,
[00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:19.900]   they have a really nice statement.
[00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.740]   Again, I'll just read from the paper
[00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:23.900]   because they said it better than I ever could.
[00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.560]   Quote, "While mainstream media has propagated the idea
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.020]   that cannabis expands the mind and enhances creativity,
[00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.540]   our results show the link between cannabis and creativity
[00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.220]   is largely a spurious correlation."
[00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.620]   Meaning that it's not the case
[00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.820]   that cannabis increases creativity,
[00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:45.240]   but, and I inserted the but in this quote,
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.140]   "But driven by differences in personality
[00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.180]   that are related to cannabis use.
[00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.100]   For example, openness to experience
[00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.820]   that are related to both cannabis use
[00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.340]   and augmented creativity."
[00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.260]   This is a real chicken egg argument.
[00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:01.400]   What do I mean by that?
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.140]   What I mean is this paper finds
[00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.620]   that people who are more open to experience
[00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.940]   are more likely to use cannabis,
[00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:11.500]   and people who use cannabis
[00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.020]   are going to be more open to new experiences.
[00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.560]   And that combination of features, openness to experience,
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.000]   and what that openness to new experiences brings
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.240]   enhances the convergent and divergent thinking
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.320]   that is characteristic of the creative process.
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.600]   So in short, cannabis increases creativity,
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.000]   but through changes in personality
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.300]   that tap into the creative process,
[00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.880]   rather than directly impacting the neural circuits
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.640]   that, for instance, turn on creativity.
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.660]   And I have to say, this study is really important
[00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:49.940]   because by exploring cannabis users
[00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.460]   not well under the influence of cannabis,
[00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:55.540]   they were able to tap into this very important,
[00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.640]   what I believe to be fact.
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.100]   Because if you think about a study
[00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.020]   in which you would have one group using cannabis
[00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:03.660]   and another group not using cannabis,
[00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:04.740]   and then you give them some tasks
[00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:06.460]   that taps into creativity,
[00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.940]   you will see effects and very likely you'll see effects
[00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:10.860]   where cannabis might even increase divergent,
[00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.600]   convergent thinking and creativity.
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:13.880]   Those results have actually been published
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.360]   many times before.
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.200]   But given the varied effects of cannabis and THC
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:19.100]   that we talked about earlier
[00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:21.200]   through all that complex signaling stuff,
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.480]   you can imagine that there will also be other studies.
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:24.840]   And in fact, there are,
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.280]   where divergent and convergent thinking and creativity
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.780]   is not assisted by cannabis
[00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:33.520]   and might even be reduced by ingesting cannabis.
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.360]   However, if one considers that divergent thinking
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:40.240]   is absolutely crucial to the creativity process,
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.240]   and the range of things that one will explore
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.860]   will be enhanced by openness
[00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.400]   and by reduced levels of anxiety.
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.320]   So a willingness to explore different options,
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.740]   some of which might seem completely crazy,
[00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:55.840]   and cannabis increases the personality types
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:59.640]   and reduces the anxiety that create that sense of openness.
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:00.920]   Well, then it makes perfect sense
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:04.160]   why cannabis would increase creativity
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.880]   in certain individuals, but not directly.
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.520]   And this study, the one I just referred to,
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.760]   which I should say was published
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.520]   in the journal "Consciousness and Cognition,"
[00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:14.620]   and again, we'll provide a link to it,
[00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:17.480]   did a wonderful job of teasing out
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:20.480]   this impact of cannabis on personality,
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.840]   which then impacts creativity.
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:25.000]   So if somebody asks you, or if you're wondering,
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.160]   or if you feel like cannabis increases creativity,
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.660]   in some sense, the answer is yes,
[00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:31.840]   but the answer is yes because of the ways
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:34.680]   that it shapes openness to new ideas.
[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:37.560]   And can, I should say can, because not in everybody,
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.760]   but can in some individuals reduce anxiety.
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.560]   What this means is that if you are somebody
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:48.560]   who experiences anxiety or increased levels of focus
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:52.480]   from cannabis, regardless of the strain,
[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:53.520]   and here I have to imagine people
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:54.880]   are exploring different strains
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:57.080]   if they're exploring them at all,
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:58.440]   exploring different modes of delivery,
[00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:00.280]   smoking or ingestible, et cetera.
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:03.200]   If you're somebody who experiences anxiety,
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.840]   it's very likely that you won't have
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:09.600]   the increased openness to experience
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.420]   and divergent ideas that will facilitate creativity.
[00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:14.480]   However, if you are somebody who achieves
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.280]   heightened levels of relaxation
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:19.160]   and reduced levels of anxiety from cannabis,
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.960]   regardless of which strain we happen to be talking about,
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:24.640]   well then, yes, it will position you
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:27.280]   to be in a heightened state of creativity,
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:30.280]   at least as defined by convergent and divergent thinking.
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.860]   [upbeat music]
[00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:36.280]   [upbeat music]
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:37.840]   (upbeat music)
