[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200]   The actual deep question then that we'll tackle today.
[00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:08.200]   How can I free myself from spending all day in my inbox?
[00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:18.600]   I'm Cal Newport and this is Deep Questions.
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.000]   The show about living and working deeply
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.040]   in an increasingly distracted world.
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:29.360]   I'm here in my deep work HQ.
[00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.000]   I'm joined by my producer, Jesse.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   Jesse, a little bit nervous today.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.840]   Why is that?
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.960]   Well, we're kind of under the timing gun
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.460]   because the restaurant that used to be below us,
[00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.560]   as we've talked about on the show, closed
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.160]   and a new restaurant's coming in, which is good.
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.080]   And I know the owner, so that's all good,
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.280]   but they've started construction
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.980]   and they've given us a little window today,
[00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.800]   one hour long, to record our podcast.
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.720]   They're going to, in theory,
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.320]   hold back on the ladder of the construction.
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.280]   So we are under the gun.
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.320]   We got to nail this thing.
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.840]   One take, keep it tight before whatever.
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.120]   Power saws and hammers fill our ears.
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.040]   One take Tony.
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.880]   One take Tony.
[00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:08.760]   We got to earn it today.
[00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.960]   I think, Jesse, we need to try harder
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.360]   to become regulars at this new place
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.280]   than we were at the old place.
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.960]   Yeah, I mean, you just got to walk downstairs
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.120]   and walk in the door, right?
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.940]   But we just got to do it.
[00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:19.840]   I think from the beginning,
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.080]   we need to instill ourselves as a fixture here.
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.080]   I know the owner, I probably know some of the staff.
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.960]   We got to have our booth.
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:27.880]   I would love to go there.
[00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.880]   Like our pre-recording, our post-recording, whatever.
[00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.400]   We didn't do that with the last place.
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.560]   We only went there a couple times.
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.040]   So this new place, we got to be regulars.
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.880]   People got to know.
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:37.700]   Can have some fans come by?
[00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:38.540]   Have fans come by.
[00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:39.380]   We'll just hold court.
[00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.920]   I want it to be like cheers.
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:42.760]   That'd be fun.
[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:43.580]   You know what I mean?
[00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.560]   And we'll be like Norm,
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.480]   the functional alcoholic mailman,
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.920]   who sat, he just sat at the bar.
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.680]   We'll just tell quips as people come in.
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.280]   We'll quip the people.
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.120]   It'll be good.
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.940]   It'll be fun.
[00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:56.780]   I'm excited.
[00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:57.980]   I'm excited for our productivity.
[00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.620]   Did you see the,
[00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:00.820]   there's a interview with me
[00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.620]   in the New York Times Magazine recently.
[00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:04.460]   So in the,
[00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:05.760]   the mentioned briefly because it's going to set up
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.380]   what I want to talk about today.
[00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.420]   For those who are watching
[00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.860]   on a youtube.com/calendepartmedia,
[00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.700]   I pulled up the article here.
[00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:15.880]   It's a colorful picture of me.
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.580]   The title of this interview was
[00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.580]   the digital workplace is designed to bring you down.
[00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.420]   Most of it is covering the type of ideas I talk about
[00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.340]   in a world without email.
[00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.700]   We discuss a little slow productivity.
[00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.320]   Here's what's relevant to today though.
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.580]   A reader wrote me and said,
[00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.480]   Cal check out the comments.
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.980]   They're gold.
[00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.460]   And I don't normally read comments on things.
[00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:40.740]   You know, I've been in this business long enough
[00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.220]   to know not to do that.
[00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.060]   But so I was like, okay,
[00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.880]   I'll check it out.
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:44.960]   And I saw what he meant
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.580]   because in the comments on this article,
[00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.100]   a lot of readers are sharing their stories
[00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.660]   and they're sharing stories about
[00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.460]   this is what my job used to be like.
[00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.120]   Now, after the age of email,
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.280]   followed by the age of Slack,
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.820]   this is what my job is like today.
[00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.340]   So you get all these case studies.
[00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.740]   It's a goldmine of case studies
[00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.500]   of the way that digital technologies
[00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.460]   entering the office really changed
[00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.940]   what work meant for a lot of people.
[00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.600]   So inspired by those comments,
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.600]   I thought what we should do today in the show
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.180]   is focus on at least something.
[00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.080]   It's a broad problem,
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.920]   but at least one part of a solution to this problem
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.260]   that might make people who feel deluged
[00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.660]   by electronic communication and work
[00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.780]   make their working life a little bit better.
[00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.880]   So I wanted to choose a concrete goal
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.140]   that we could work on today's show.
[00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.680]   And I wanted it to be a goal.
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.300]   Here's what I decided.
[00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.300]   I wanted it to be a goal about checking inboxes
[00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.500]   or checking into chat channels less frequently.
[00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.860]   Now, this is a critical issue.
[00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.240]   If we could just get that behavioral change,
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.440]   that single behavioral change
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.060]   into the average knowledge worker professional existence,
[00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.560]   I think it really would make a big difference.
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.720]   To emphasize how big of an issue this is,
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.760]   I'm actually loading up on the screen here
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.880]   an article that I've actually cited quite a bit.
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.600]   And I've actually talked to the data scientists
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.020]   who produced this data.
[00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:09.600]   This was all in a world without email.
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.360]   All right, this is a blog post
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.720]   from the software company RescueTime.
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.200]   RescueTime has a software tool
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.080]   that tracks what you do on your computer
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.520]   and how long you spend doing it.
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:22.560]   Sort of like the screen time feature for iPhones,
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.080]   though it's been around much longer than that feature.
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.040]   And the idea is you learn about what you're doing
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.680]   so you can adjust your habits.
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.400]   This gives them a huge corpus, however,
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.680]   of observational data.
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.600]   Tens of thousands of knowledge workers collecting this data.
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.200]   So they hired some data scientists
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.120]   to properly anonymize this data and analyze it.
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.400]   This was one of the first big findings
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.040]   the RescueTime data scientists came up with.
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.800]   And I'm just gonna scroll to the punchline here.
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.400]   The average knowledge worker checks in
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.520]   on email or instant messenger every six minutes.
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.120]   A crazy number.
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.520]   And again, they got this by just literally watching
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.400]   exactly what tens of thousands of knowledge workers did
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.360]   over many, many days.
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.300]   They were running the software that tracked every program
[00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.100]   they used and how long they used it.
[00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.820]   I'll show you a chart here as well.
[00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:14.760]   For those who are watching,
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.240]   this is a histogram of average minutes
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.040]   between checking communication apps.
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.160]   That's the X-axis and the Y-axis
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.960]   is how many of the observed users check that often.
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.120]   And you see the median is six minutes,
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.080]   but there is the largest.
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.520]   So what would that be?
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:38.520]   The max, the time between email checks
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.640]   that the most users actually satisfied was,
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.780]   I'm looking at it here, one minute.
[00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.680]   So that is the most frequent interval observed
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.700]   between email checks was one minute.
[00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:55.200]   After the median of six, there's just a long tail.
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.280]   So there's a lot of users that,
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.480]   a small number of users for these really long.
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.800]   And honestly, I bet this long tail, Jesse,
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.760]   where you have one user who checked every 100 minutes,
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.600]   one user who checked every 125 minutes,
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.960]   I bet a lot of that is people that were away on a conference
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.360]   when the data was being collected,
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.840]   or forgot to turn on the app or something like that.
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:14.800]   Anyways, here's the point.
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:19.800]   We check email, not a lot, but constantly, constantly.
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:24.800]   This is a huge issue because as I emphasize in that article,
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.580]   as I emphasize in my book, "A World Without Email,"
[00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:32.160]   context switching is expensive for the human brain.
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.960]   It takes a lot of neuronal machinery,
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.420]   a lot of cognitive state change
[00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:39.960]   to shift our attention from one target to another.
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.160]   We're meant to be focused on one thing at a time.
[00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.840]   It's not easy to switch.
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.260]   If you're checking your inbox once every six minutes,
[00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.400]   you're constantly instigating these context shifts.
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.160]   You never actually let your mind settle
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.360]   on one cognitive context,
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.240]   so you can't muster your full capabilities.
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.520]   There's another issue that happens,
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.680]   and this is an idea I've been developing more recently.
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:01.680]   It's not in my book.
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:02.800]   I mentioned it briefly in this article,
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.520]   but I think it's also critical.
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.400]   When you're looking at, say, an email inbox,
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:12.480]   and you see on the screen 20 different emails
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.240]   that you'll need to respond to,
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.280]   each of them about something different,
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:19.160]   each of them requiring a different cognitive context
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.880]   to really think about and understand,
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.080]   when you're seeing those all at the same time,
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:26.120]   the standard experience looking at an inbox
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.240]   overwhelms and freezes your brain.
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.480]   And I think a lot of people have this experience.
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.160]   It's like, "Oh, man, I gotta clear out my inbox,"
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.000]   and you just freeze.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.480]   You freeze like, "I don't even know how to get started."
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:40.160]   You feel this resistance, you feel this discomfort,
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.600]   and you jump over to the web
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.080]   to look up baseball trade rumors,
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:45.480]   or you pull out social media,
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.120]   'cause your mind doesn't even know what to do with it.
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:50.160]   That's because you're literally giving your mind a problem
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:51.400]   it does not know how to solve.
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:53.640]   You say, "Load up the proper context
[00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:54.760]   "for what we're doing next, please,
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:55.840]   "and what are we doing next?"
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:58.160]   15 different things, they're each different contexts.
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.240]   The mind can't load 15 contexts at a time.
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.560]   So the inbox by itself is a disaster.
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:05.400]   Switching to the inbox once every six minutes is a disaster.
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.960]   We can't focus, we freeze,
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:10.120]   and it makes us subjectively experience
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:11.480]   the workday as worse.
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:14.320]   It's exhausting, frustrating, and misery-making.
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:16.520]   So guys, we're then gonna turn our attention
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:17.840]   to reader questions.
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:20.840]   I have five questions from my readers and podcast listeners
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:24.200]   that all loosely relate to exactly this theme.
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.440]   So we can take our ideas and put 'em out
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:28.160]   and practice them on real people's issues,
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.040]   and then we'll switch gears
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:31.600]   to end with something interesting.
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:35.040]   All right, so let's deep dive on this question.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.160]   How do I not spend all day in my inbox?
[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:40.040]   I think the place we have to start
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:43.160]   before we get specific with strategies
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:45.520]   is asking why is this even a hard challenge
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:47.640]   in the first place?
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:51.840]   Why can't we just do what Tim Ferriss suggested?
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:54.000]   So again, for the people who are watching on YouTube,
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.520]   youtube.com/calnewportmedia,
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:00.460]   I'm loading up a blog post from Tim Ferriss's website,
[00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:02.800]   and what I've loaded up here
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:07.800]   is the email autoresponder that in his 2007 book,
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:10.680]   was it "The Four-Hour Workweek,"
[00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:14.780]   Tim suggested that knowledge workers use.
[00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:17.280]   Let me read this autoresponder for you.
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.840]   So autoresponder, this is what anyone who writes you
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.960]   will automatically get this sent back to them.
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:25.600]   Greetings, friends, whoops, email subscription.
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.160]   All right, greetings, friends.
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.760]   Due to high workload, I'm currently checking
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:33.400]   and responding to email twice daily at 12 p.m. Eastern
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:35.200]   and 4 p.m. Eastern.
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.560]   If you require urgent assistance,
[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:39.740]   parentheses, please ensure it is urgent,
[00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:42.480]   that cannot wait until either 12 p.m. or 4 p.m.,
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:46.400]   please contact me via phone at whatever phone number.
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.280]   Thank you for understanding this move
[00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:49.800]   to more efficiency and effectiveness.
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:52.960]   It helps me accomplish more to serve you better.
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.400]   So why can't we just do that?
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:57.220]   I don't wanna spend all day checking my inbox, I won't.
[00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:00.040]   I'll check it twice and I'll have an autoresponder
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:02.260]   and that way people will know,
[00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.120]   so people won't be upset about it.
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:09.140]   This strategy of just deciding to batch your email
[00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:13.720]   was tractable back when email was new.
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:14.960]   And I think this is very important
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:17.800]   when we evaluate Tim's suggestion here.
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:21.000]   This came out in a book in 2007
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.720]   that he wrote in 2005 to 2006,
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:26.280]   talking about his experiences in the workplace
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.700]   in 2003, 2004.
[00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:32.360]   2003, 2004, that early 2000s that he's writing about,
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:33.840]   the motivation for his book,
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:36.800]   that was pretty early in the period of ubiquitous email,
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.080]   early in the period of email
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:39.880]   integrating itself into our workflows.
[00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:41.320]   You could get away with that.
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:42.800]   Oh, this is how I check my email.
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:43.800]   Now, I think a lot of people,
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.320]   there was a meme online of people
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:48.100]   sort of rejecting that autoresponder,
[00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:50.800]   like, look, if I use this autoresponder,
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:53.260]   I would get knives thrown at my eyes or whatever.
[00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:54.960]   That's just the wording thing.
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:56.560]   Yeah, there's a tone to it
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:57.840]   that some people say is disagreeable.
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.460]   You could wordsmith that, whatever,
[00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:03.260]   make the tone very agreeable for your particular context.
[00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:04.480]   That used to work.
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.420]   Tim was right to suggest it
[00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:09.080]   when he was thinking about 2003, 2004.
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:12.760]   2023, that would not work.
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:13.680]   And I think we all recognize
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:15.560]   if we just said I'm gonna check twice a day,
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:17.800]   it would be a disaster.
[00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:20.280]   So why is that?
[00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:23.300]   Well, that's because as email
[00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:26.320]   became increasingly integrated into the workplace
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:29.700]   and Slack came later and other types of tools like Teams,
[00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:32.160]   we developed a mode of collaboration
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.760]   that I call the hyperactive hive mind.
[00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:37.200]   Now, we've talked about this on the show before,
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.220]   so I won't go into too much detail.
[00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:39.980]   My whole book, "World Without Email" is about this,
[00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:41.400]   so I won't go into too much detail.
[00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:42.840]   But just as a refresher,
[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:45.500]   the hyperactive hive mind is a mode of collaboration
[00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:47.580]   in which you work most things out on the fly
[00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:49.620]   with ad hoc back and forth messages,
[00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:52.900]   either an email or an instant messenger services.
[00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:55.200]   So now if we're trying to figure something out,
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:59.360]   we will just start sending messages back and forth.
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.120]   When I see a message from you, I'll reply to it.
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:02.040]   You'll reply at some point.
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:03.640]   I'll see that, I'll reply to you.
[00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:04.560]   And we figure this thing out.
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:06.000]   We just rock and roll.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.280]   That is the hyperactive hive mind mode of collaboration.
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.440]   If you were using the hyperactive hive mind
[00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:12.920]   mode of collaboration,
[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:17.000]   following Tim's suggestion of just declaring 12 and four,
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.760]   that's it, is disastrous.
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:22.800]   Because the emails coming into your inbox
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:25.320]   are not these one-time requests
[00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:26.920]   that you have a couple of days to respond to
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:28.240]   or a few hours to respond to.
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.800]   It's message three of seven
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:32.480]   that has to bounce back and forth
[00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:35.800]   so that a decision can be made before the end of business.
[00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:38.400]   You can't wait three hours for your next reply
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:39.280]   'cause that's not enough time
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:40.360]   for the next reply to come back
[00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:41.840]   and then you reply to that and then they reply to you
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:43.640]   in time for the decision to be made.
[00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:45.540]   If we have to figure out
[00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:47.600]   what is our plan for picking up the client tomorrow
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:50.120]   from the airport and it's noon today
[00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:52.920]   and it's gonna take five back and forth messages,
[00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:54.240]   I can't wait till four,
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:56.040]   check my inbox once and then be done
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:57.700]   because we will not reach a decision
[00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:00.080]   and that client won't get picked up.
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:03.340]   So the hyperactive hive mind makes batching difficult.
[00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:05.020]   Now we can actually find this shift.
[00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:07.280]   We can find this reality in data.
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:10.200]   I'm gonna load up one more thing on the tablet here.
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:11.840]   This is a academic paper.
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:15.120]   We're jumping ahead now to 2016.
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:16.600]   We're gonna look at an academic paper
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:21.320]   that was written by Gloria Mark from UC Irvine.
[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:26.320]   2016 paper, this was I believe published in CHI.
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:30.760]   So the Human Computer Interaction Conference.
[00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:34.440]   It's a well-known human interaction conference venue.
[00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:35.520]   All right, so here's the paper.
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:39.040]   It's called "Email Duration, Batching, and Self-Interruption
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.720]   "Patterns of Email Use on Productivity and Stress."
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:44.000]   And just right here in the abstract,
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.280]   we see they tested email batching.
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:49.160]   So telling people to just check email twice a day
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:52.160]   and no other times.
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:54.800]   And what they found, and I've highlighted this on the screen,
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:58.040]   batching email is associated with higher rated productivity,
[00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:01.620]   but despite widespread claims,
[00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:05.120]   we found no evidence that batching email
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:07.020]   leads to lower stress.
[00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:09.080]   If you actually dive into the paper,
[00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:12.120]   you find for groups of subjects
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.400]   that have certain personality traits
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:17.320]   that actually significantly increase stress.
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:20.520]   So it did not make people's lives less stressful
[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:22.120]   to get out of their inbox.
[00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:22.940]   Now why is this?
[00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:26.340]   If we argued this inbox checking is a stressful thing,
[00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:28.000]   we freeze when we see all those messages,
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.380]   the context switching back and forth
[00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:31.040]   makes it subjectively feel worse.
[00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:35.000]   So if we get rid of all of that by batching,
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.600]   why is our overall stress level stay high?
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:40.480]   It's because the hyperactive hive mind.
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.600]   If your office, like in this paper,
[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:44.000]   runs on the hyperactive hive mind,
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.880]   you feel stressed because you know about all the things
[00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:49.080]   that are being stalled because you're not in your inbox.
[00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:50.580]   You know that you're screwing people,
[00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:51.920]   decisions aren't getting made,
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:53.560]   that you are a source of annoyance.
[00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:55.100]   That's highly stressful.
[00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:57.500]   It's why they found when they dived into this research
[00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:59.240]   that people who are more conscientious
[00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:01.740]   about this type of thing get even more stressed.
[00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:03.360]   So the more you worry about what other people
[00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:06.800]   think about you, the more stressed you are gonna get
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:08.960]   deploying that particular strategy.
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:13.680]   So we can't just say, check email less, check Slack less.
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:15.640]   We have built our offices around the need
[00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:16.900]   to check this constantly.
[00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:20.160]   So if we're going to get to our goal,
[00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:22.380]   we're gonna actually have to change some things.
[00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:24.500]   We're gonna have to introduce new ideas and strategies
[00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:26.600]   if we're gonna accomplish the goal of checking email less.
[00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:29.340]   And otherwise, in other words, I should say,
[00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:32.280]   checking email less is the end result
[00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:33.680]   of a lot of other changes.
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:36.080]   That is a flip about how most other people think about it,
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:37.400]   where checking email less should just be
[00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:39.560]   the first change you make to make your life less stressful.
[00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:40.400]   That won't work.
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:42.140]   We have a lot of work to do.
[00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:44.920]   So what I wanna suggest is three main strategies.
[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:45.800]   We'll go through 'em.
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:49.740]   Three main strategies to help transform your work
[00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:51.920]   sufficiently away from the hyperactive hive mind
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:53.120]   that you can check your email less.
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:55.640]   And then I'll have one fallback bonus strategy
[00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:57.320]   in case none of that works.
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:02.180]   All right, number one, piece of advice number one,
[00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:04.040]   write better emails.
[00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:06.440]   All right, this is a technique that I actually
[00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:11.440]   first introduced in Deep Work, my 2016 book, Deep Work.
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:14.480]   I called it process-centric emailing.
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:17.860]   And the idea was you put more information
[00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:21.620]   in the emails you send about how you
[00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:24.580]   and the person you're talking to are gonna collaborate
[00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:27.320]   to accomplish whatever goal you're writing about.
[00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:28.680]   So instead of just rock and rolling,
[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:30.160]   I'll just send you something and just let's start
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:32.040]   a conversation going back and forth,
[00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:33.280]   you write off the bat, say,
[00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:36.200]   this is how I think we should collaborate about this.
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:38.940]   And you give a plan in that initial email
[00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:41.320]   that reduces the need for lots of unscheduled emails
[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:42.160]   going forward.
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:44.200]   Let me give you an example.
[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:47.300]   Here is a standard email, a non-process-centric email,
[00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:48.720]   a bad email to send.
[00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:52.960]   Lisa asked us to present our merit simplification plan
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:54.800]   at the faculty meeting on Friday.
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:56.840]   What do you think we need to change
[00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:59.680]   in our old slide deck before we do that?
[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:02.760]   That's a very standard email,
[00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:05.520]   but you have just initiated with that
[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:08.600]   an open-ended back and forth message exchange,
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:09.900]   which by itself is gonna require
[00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:11.600]   that you check email all the time.
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:16.120]   Here, by contrast, is a process-centric alternative
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:17.500]   response to that message.
[00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:21.040]   Lisa asked us to present our merit simplification plan
[00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:22.640]   at the faculty meeting on Friday.
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:25.000]   Here is what I propose.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.700]   I uploaded the latest draft of our slides to Google Drive.
[00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:30.840]   I'll look through them and add any updates or comments
[00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:33.000]   by close of business on Monday.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.640]   Jesse, you then have the token
[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:36.480]   until close of business Tuesday to review it.
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:39.560]   And then Caleb, you can take the token on Wednesday,
[00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:40.600]   put any changes you want
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:42.420]   before the close of business on Wednesday.
[00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:45.320]   Let's then meet on Thursday to discuss all of those notes
[00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:48.620]   and decide any changes we wanna make for the final version.
[00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:50.800]   I put three times below,
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:53.040]   just reply all with which of any of those work,
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:54.240]   and I will see you then.
[00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:57.880]   Now that email is a pain to write.
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:00.360]   You can't just, "Uh, what do you think?"
[00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:02.300]   Boom, and it's out of my inbox temporarily
[00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:03.140]   like we normally do.
[00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:05.280]   You have to actually sit here and think this through.
[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:08.240]   But this may have just saved you
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:10.680]   basically any other email exchange between now
[00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:12.880]   and when that presentation happens on Friday.
[00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:14.880]   You know what you're doing, they know what they're doing.
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:16.760]   They'll reply all with times.
[00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:18.000]   So you can see that and say,
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.600]   "Okay, here's a time we're doing it."
[00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:21.080]   And that's it.
[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:23.960]   And this whole thing gets done and it gets done well.
[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:25.680]   And you have not had to keep checking your inbox
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:26.880]   to have endless back and forth.
[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:28.200]   Like, "I don't know, what about this?
[00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:29.240]   Yeah, I was looking at this slide.
[00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:30.680]   What do you think about these changes?"
[00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:32.620]   And now that old way means
[00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:34.100]   you're constantly going back and forth.
[00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:35.660]   You're constantly checking emails.
[00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:37.460]   So yes, what a pain to write this.
[00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:40.660]   This took probably three minutes to think of and write
[00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:43.320]   when the initial response would have take 30 seconds.
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:47.580]   However, this probably saved 15 emails
[00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:49.660]   that you would have had to keep checking your inbox
[00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:52.220]   and seen and replied to.
[00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:54.260]   15 emails, each of which is creating,
[00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:57.180]   let's say 10 minutes of a cognitive context shift
[00:18:57.180 --> 00:19:02.080]   induced overload in which you can't focus and feel exhausted.
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:06.920]   That's 150 minutes of reduced capacity
[00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:09.820]   in exchange for three minutes of thinking through an email.
[00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:12.180]   So that's process centric emailing.
[00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:14.280]   We actually have a good question about that,
[00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:17.520]   about process centric emailing being deployed in the wild
[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:19.680]   and some issues someone's having coming up in the show.
[00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:21.520]   So stay tuned for the question block.
[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:24.640]   All right, piece of advice number two
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:28.360]   for reducing the time you spend in your inbox.
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:31.040]   Defer back and forth interactions
[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:33.540]   to synchrony, synchronous settings.
[00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:37.800]   Defer back and forth interactions to synchronous settings.
[00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:40.920]   I just two things being captured
[00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:44.160]   in this description of the advice.
[00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:47.320]   One is that we're deferring back and forth interaction.
[00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:50.400]   So implicit in that is a value judgment
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:52.720]   about what email is good for and what it's not.
[00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:54.580]   And it's important that we get this
[00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:55.820]   out in the open right now
[00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:57.760]   so that we're all on the same page.
[00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:01.280]   Email is great for delivering information to people.
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:05.280]   If I need a file from you, email is a fantastic technology.
[00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:07.400]   You can attach that and send it to me.
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:10.040]   Email is also great for broadcasting information
[00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:12.240]   or reminders.
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:14.040]   Is there a talk coming up this week
[00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:15.600]   that I might wanna know about?
[00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:18.000]   Send an email so I can see that.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.640]   Is there a reminder that the parking garage
[00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:21.540]   is gonna be closed early on Friday?
[00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:22.760]   Email is fantastic.
[00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:25.040]   You can send that information to everyone parking
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:27.520]   in that parking garage with the press of one button.
[00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:29.880]   It's fantastic for broadcasting information.
[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:31.560]   It's fantastic for sending files.
[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:34.820]   It's also good for questions that can be responded to
[00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:36.180]   with a short answer.
[00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:40.200]   So maybe you heard the parking garage is gonna be closed,
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:42.520]   but you don't remember if it was Friday or next Friday,
[00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:43.360]   you can email me and say,
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:46.200]   "Hey, Cal, is the parking garage closed this Friday
[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:47.180]   "or next Friday?"
[00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:48.440]   I can respond to that quickly.
[00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:50.420]   Yes, no, it's next Friday.
[00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:52.080]   When I get a chance, I can see that respond to it.
[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:54.200]   That's a fantastic use of the technology.
[00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:55.640]   It's easy for me to respond to.
[00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:57.240]   It's not particularly urgent.
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:58.840]   You get the information you need.
[00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:01.380]   Neither of us has to spend much cognitive overhead.
[00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:04.160]   The place where email drags us down,
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:07.420]   as we've now been elaborating,
[00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:09.760]   is when we have to do back and forth interaction,
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:11.760]   where there's gonna be many emails back and forth
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:12.920]   to resolve something.
[00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:15.960]   This is specifically where we need a better solution.
[00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:17.600]   Process-centric emailing helps.
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:19.480]   This piece of advice gives another suggestion,
[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:21.960]   which is move the back and forth out of the inbox
[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:24.520]   and into a synchronous setting.
[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:26.160]   And that's the second piece I wanna highlight
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.600]   about this piece of advice.
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:30.840]   Synchronous means a place where we're going back and forth
[00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:33.200]   in real time.
[00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:36.840]   So we're actually talking with each other in the same room
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:40.160]   or on the same phone line or in the same conference,
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:42.080]   but we're going back and forth in real time.
[00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:44.840]   That could even be, and this confuses people,
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:48.080]   but that could even be over a tool like Slack.
[00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:50.160]   You and I have any back and forth conversation.
[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:52.400]   We're both there on Slack at the same time
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:56.560]   is a perfectly reasonable use of Slack.
[00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:59.080]   The key is we're going back and forth.
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:00.280]   We've agreed when we're gonna talk
[00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:01.720]   and we figure it all out right there.
[00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:04.120]   So we can get the 15 back and forth messages or chats
[00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:07.480]   can happen right there in 15 seconds.
[00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:09.800]   All right, so how do you do this?
[00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:11.760]   Three tactics I'd like to suggest.
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:14.820]   One is my favorite, which is office hours.
[00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:18.560]   I have been preaching this since 2016.
[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:21.720]   I think 2016, I wrote a Harvard Business Review article
[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:24.600]   about this and I've been talking about it ever since.
[00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:27.440]   All professions that work in office buildings,
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:28.880]   you should have office hours.
[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:32.000]   This days on these times I'm available.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.880]   My office is open, my phone is on.
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:36.720]   I have a Zoom conference activated.
[00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:39.640]   Defer back and forth conversations to these office hours.
[00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:41.480]   The email comes in, hey, what should we do
[00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:44.680]   about the merit thing we're presenting on Friday?
[00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:45.740]   You say like, yeah, great question.
[00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:46.580]   Let's figure that out.
[00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:48.240]   I have some questions.
[00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:49.840]   Just stop by one of my upcoming office hours.
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:51.560]   We'll work it out.
[00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:54.100]   And you can push so many things into those office hours.
[00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:55.440]   Yeah, let's talk about, hey, when you get a chance,
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:56.560]   come to one of my upcoming office hours
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:58.880]   or give me a call during my office hours.
[00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:00.100]   We'll figure that out.
[00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:01.880]   And it is so much more efficient
[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:04.380]   to just give five minutes back and forth
[00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:06.040]   in time you've already set aside
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:08.480]   than to initiate those back and forth emails.
[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:13.600]   The phone call deferral is another very effective tactic.
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:15.200]   Say, ah, it's a good point.
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.700]   Call me when you get a chance.
[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:18.960]   Yeah, let's discuss this on the phone.
[00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:19.800]   Just give me a call.
[00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:22.120]   I'm usually, you know, usually you can catch me whatever
[00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:23.800]   in the afternoons.
[00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:26.840]   The phone deferral tactic works for two reasons.
[00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:30.920]   One, 50% of the things coming towards you will disappear.
[00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:34.260]   And if it's someone from generation Z
[00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:35.100]   trying to get in touch with you,
[00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:38.600]   let's revise that to 95% of interactions.
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:39.440]   'Cause they don't wanna call.
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:40.360]   I don't wanna do that.
[00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:41.480]   It's not really that important.
[00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:45.920]   I'm just, you know, internet, internet, phone,
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:47.120]   tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock.
[00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:48.920]   And then they do like a synchronized dance
[00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:52.040]   and put on their Oculus goggles
[00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:55.060]   and ironically watch cartoons.
[00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:57.040]   I don't know what generation Z does, Jesse.
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:58.680]   I don't know. Synchronized dance.
[00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:01.040]   Isn't that what you do on TikTok?
[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:01.880]   I think so.
[00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:02.720]   According to TikTok, like most people--
[00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:04.440]   I only know what TikTok about through you.
[00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:06.660]   Oh, then you know nothing about TikTok.
[00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:08.440]   Whatever.
[00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:09.840]   Coming from the guy who wrote a whole New Yorker piece
[00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:10.680]   on TikTok.
[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:13.360]   Something about dancing.
[00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:16.400]   The kids are dancing and I don't know,
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:19.360]   they're all hopped up on marijuana.
[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:24.320]   When I was young, we had to kill, this is true.
[00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:27.160]   We had to kill a German soldier on our walk to school
[00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:29.440]   up a pill every day.
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:30.520]   And there was a war going on.
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:33.880]   Anyways, the point being, call me.
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:37.140]   Some percentage of the things go away.
[00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:39.560]   The things that remain are now dispatched
[00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:41.360]   much more effectively.
[00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:43.120]   I know it's a pain when that phone rings,
[00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:44.320]   you're like, oh, I have to answer this.
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:45.660]   But honestly, if you answer that,
[00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:48.400]   and in two minutes you figure something out,
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:50.800]   you've saved yourself maybe five to 10 emails,
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:52.960]   each requiring five to 10 email checks.
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:57.560]   The overall amount of stress is much less.
[00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:59.640]   And so anyways, I work with some people,
[00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:00.800]   I have at least one person in mind
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:03.200]   who uses this all the time and I appreciate it.
[00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:04.840]   He often says, just call me, just call me.
[00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:07.460]   'Cause we have complicated things to work out.
[00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:09.320]   And we work it on the phone,
[00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:10.680]   and usually it takes five minutes.
[00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:11.720]   And email it would have been,
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:12.840]   in some of these cases, impossible.
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:14.520]   It's nuanced, it's complicated.
[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:16.000]   So defer to the phone.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.360]   Finally, you can maintain your own
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:21.880]   internal to discuss list, TO discuss list.
[00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:25.140]   So if there's individuals you do a lot of business with,
[00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:26.600]   colleagues that you talk to a lot,
[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:28.680]   a manager, a department chair,
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:30.280]   someone who's on a committee with you,
[00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:32.600]   and you talk to them a lot, just maintain a list.
[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:34.640]   I do this in Trello of,
[00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:36.240]   oh, here's something I wanna talk to them about.
[00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:37.380]   Let me just put it on the list.
[00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:38.760]   Oh, here's something else that comes up later.
[00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:41.000]   Let me put this on the to discuss list.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.540]   And then next time you talk to them, you say, great,
[00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:45.020]   I have like five things I wanna go through.
[00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:46.260]   And if you don't have something on the books,
[00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:48.380]   but you see this list is getting big,
[00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:51.220]   you just email them and say, hey, I'm gonna call you.
[00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:52.580]   Let me just warn you, I have a lot of things to go through.
[00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:53.520]   I'm just gonna call you.
[00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:55.300]   Unless I hear otherwise, I'm gonna call you at like three,
[00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:56.980]   and then like keep trying every half hour or something.
[00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:58.060]   I have a lot to discuss.
[00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:00.140]   And then you get through a lot of things at once.
[00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:01.820]   So aggregating on your end,
[00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:03.340]   things to discuss with the same person,
[00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:05.580]   and then going through all of them at once.
[00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:07.300]   I do this all the time as well,
[00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:09.380]   especially my administrative roles at Georgetown.
[00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:12.380]   All right, so defer back and forth interactions
[00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:15.660]   to some sort of synchronous setting.
[00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:17.440]   Short questions, announcements, broadcast,
[00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:19.820]   email's great, don't complain about it.
[00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:22.780]   And I gotta say, Jesse, like one of the things that,
[00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:24.180]   I'm always, it doesn't upset me,
[00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:27.420]   but it happens a lot when I'm talking about email,
[00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:30.720]   is people, when someone comes back and it's like,
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:31.560]   yeah, I'm telling you, man,
[00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:34.020]   I grew through emails out of control.
[00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:38.740]   I get all of these advertising emails.
[00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:40.020]   I get all these promotional emails,
[00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:42.740]   or people like BCC, me on too many announcements.
[00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:44.420]   That's not a problem.
[00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:48.660]   I am not stressed out by having a lot of LL Bean emails
[00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:50.460]   or campaign email.
[00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:52.420]   It's annoying, you delete them or filter them.
[00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:53.580]   That's not stressful.
[00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:54.940]   What's stressful is having a lot of emails
[00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:56.140]   that require you to respond.
[00:26:56.140 --> 00:26:57.740]   So that's what I'm focusing on.
[00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:03.300]   All right, final piece of advice here, deploy processes.
[00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:07.300]   All right, so we've process centric email,
[00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:08.620]   that's process lightweight.
[00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:10.420]   Defer things to synchronous settings,
[00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:11.740]   that's process lightweight.
[00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:13.660]   For what remains, you might consider
[00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:16.660]   actually putting in place hardcore,
[00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:18.940]   actually specified, we've written it down,
[00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:20.920]   all the stakeholders agree on it,
[00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:23.380]   collaboration processes that are customized
[00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:25.720]   to the specific thing that you are doing.
[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:29.420]   This is the big idea from my book, "A World Without Email",
[00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:33.220]   is that ultimately the things you do again and again,
[00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:36.060]   the collaborative things you do again and again
[00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:39.180]   in a professional setting should have clearly defined
[00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:41.080]   processes for how that work unfolds.
[00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:44.060]   It shouldn't just be, we'll figure it out with emails
[00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:46.200]   and send each other random Zoom invites.
[00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:48.100]   You should figure out here's how we do this work.
[00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:49.580]   And as long as you are being clear about
[00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:51.140]   here's how we do this work,
[00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:53.540]   you can engineer those processes
[00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:56.540]   to not require a lot of unscheduled messages
[00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:59.340]   that have to be received and responded to.
[00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:02.100]   So for example, our ad agency, Jesse, right?
[00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:06.040]   Our ad agency built what I think is a very nice process
[00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:09.260]   for interacting with us about the ads we do.
[00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:12.100]   There's a lot of back and forth that has to happen, right?
[00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:13.700]   Can you tell me when this ad aired?
[00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:14.580]   What were the numbers?
[00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:15.740]   Here's the scripts.
[00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:18.660]   They built a very nice process based around notion
[00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:23.380]   where every ad read has its own database entry
[00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:25.940]   that can show up in a calendar
[00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:28.980]   or can show up in a list of everything that that client,
[00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:30.720]   every ad read we've done for that client,
[00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:33.380]   all of the relevant information is attached.
[00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:35.980]   After each episode, there's a process where you go through
[00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:37.260]   and you add the timestamps.
[00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:38.860]   There's a process for when and where
[00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:40.580]   you add the upload numbers.
[00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:43.780]   In theory, we can run this podcast
[00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:45.460]   with complicated advertiser demands
[00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:48.860]   without ever sending an email to our ad agency.
[00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:50.620]   There's a process, which is great
[00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:53.460]   because I don't want us to be sending back and forth
[00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:55.540]   a lot of emails.
[00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:56.700]   Feedback documents.
[00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:58.340]   This is just, I'm just throwing out a few examples
[00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:00.060]   of processes here.
[00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:02.260]   Feedback documents are another big one.
[00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:04.620]   So let's say you have a proposal
[00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:08.300]   and your team needs to weigh in on it.
[00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:09.300]   Do you have any feedback on this
[00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:11.100]   before I submit it, et cetera.
[00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:12.780]   Just having a shared document.
[00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:15.140]   You just announce to people.
[00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:17.740]   The shared document, go on in there,
[00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:20.140]   type your name, type your feedback whenever you have it.
[00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:22.340]   This is when I'm gonna take everything in there
[00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:24.060]   and review it.
[00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:26.940]   Again, it seems, why not just have people email you
[00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:28.980]   because it's clearer
[00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:32.200]   and it doesn't require back and forth messages.
[00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:34.140]   Daily standups could be part of a process.
[00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:36.220]   Hey, we're a computer programming team.
[00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:37.820]   By having daily standups in 10 minutes,
[00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:39.300]   we can figure out who's working on what,
[00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:41.620]   what do they need, who needs something new.
[00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:43.980]   We've saved back and forth emails to figure that out.
[00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:46.240]   So 10 minutes, well-structured every day
[00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:50.300]   can reduce 10 not so structured emails
[00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:51.540]   that might have to happen during the day.
[00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:52.920]   That adds up.
[00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:55.060]   That can have a really big difference.
[00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:56.540]   So there's a lot of different things you can do here,
[00:29:56.540 --> 00:30:01.040]   but the key is moving your collaboration methods away
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:03.400]   from unscheduled messages and towards something
[00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:04.940]   that is structured enough
[00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:07.220]   that I don't have to keep checking an inbox.
[00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:13.380]   These type of strategies are the type of things
[00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:17.500]   that will aggregate to actually relieving the pressure
[00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:19.540]   of your inbox of your chat channels.
[00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:21.020]   If you're process-centric emailing,
[00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:23.420]   if you're deferring back and forth out of your inbox,
[00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:26.900]   if you have hardcore, well-structured processes
[00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:28.620]   for the things you do again and again
[00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:31.480]   that don't require unscheduled messaging,
[00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:33.800]   you are freeing yourself from the clutches
[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:35.160]   of the hyperactive hive mind.
[00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:37.320]   Therefore, the number of messages in your inbox
[00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:40.640]   at any one time that is in the middle
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:42.680]   of a fast moving back and forth conversation
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:44.220]   is drastically reduced.
[00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:45.680]   Most of the messages in your inbox,
[00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:48.440]   your chat channels are now announcing things
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:49.980]   or sending you information or questions
[00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:51.440]   that need an answer when you get around to it.
[00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:52.620]   It's not urgent.
[00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:54.160]   If that's the reality of your inbox,
[00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:55.180]   it's not an empty inbox,
[00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:56.700]   but it's an inbox you could check twice a day
[00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:58.420]   and no one would care.
[00:30:58.420 --> 00:30:59.820]   There would be no problems
[00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:02.680]   because the stuff that requires actual quick collaboration
[00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:04.640]   is happening elsewhere.
[00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:05.760]   So those are my three pieces of advice.
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:07.000]   So here's my bonus fourth thing.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.640]   Let's say none of that works.
[00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:11.240]   Consider re-engineering your job.
[00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:16.860]   Consider changing what it is you do,
[00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:18.360]   your specific requirements,
[00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:19.840]   who you work with, the teams you're on.
[00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:22.220]   Consider trying to change those
[00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:24.040]   so that you can leave the setting
[00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:27.120]   in which hyperactive hive mind is inescapable.
[00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:29.700]   And the point I wanna make here
[00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:32.740]   is that there's a pretty standardized list
[00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:34.980]   that people agree on of attributes of a job
[00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:36.560]   that means a change has to happen.
[00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:37.980]   I mean, in my book, "So Good They Can't Ignore You,"
[00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:39.540]   I had a list of these things.
[00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:41.500]   You don't like the people you work with.
[00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:45.920]   What you're doing doesn't align with your values.
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:50.220]   The job you have does not offer you a way forward
[00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:52.700]   to increasingly autonomous or interesting configurations.
[00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:53.940]   It's like highly constrictive
[00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:55.500]   or you have a high ceiling on you.
[00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:56.840]   I listed those three attributes
[00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:58.300]   of "So Good They Can't Ignore You"
[00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:01.260]   as reasons you might wanna switch your job
[00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:02.140]   either to a different job
[00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:04.500]   or really change what you're doing within your company.
[00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:06.060]   We should add this on the list.
[00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:10.940]   Being beholden to the hyperactive hive mind
[00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:13.020]   is a misery-making machine.
[00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:15.420]   Having to constantly check an inbox or chat channel
[00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:16.680]   once every six minutes,
[00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:18.920]   to suffer from cognitive context freezing
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:21.340]   when you see 15 emails and all the responses
[00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:22.220]   and you don't know how to do them
[00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:24.220]   and your mind can't handle 15 contacts,
[00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:26.940]   you never be able to actually do anything
[00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:28.460]   close to your full potential
[00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:30.540]   'cause your mind is constantly muddled
[00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:33.460]   from a proximate context shift
[00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:35.680]   caused by this hyperactive hive mind back and forth.
[00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:37.780]   That is a really negative,
[00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:39.940]   that is a really distressing work environment.
[00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:41.660]   I don't think that is something that we should see
[00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:42.940]   as being completely different
[00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:44.940]   in terms of its degree of difficulty
[00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:47.980]   than an office that is too hot all the time
[00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:50.820]   or that you have an atmosphere of toxicity
[00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:53.260]   where you really just dislike the people you're around.
[00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:54.820]   I think we should put it on the same level
[00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:55.740]   as those type of issues.
[00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:58.460]   It is that subjectively negative.
[00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:00.580]   It is that distressing.
[00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:03.540]   And if your current job, your current team
[00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:05.020]   requires the hyperactive hive mind
[00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:06.220]   and you can't get out of it,
[00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:08.140]   no matter how much you try to re-engineer,
[00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:09.700]   put that on your list of things that makes you say,
[00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:11.260]   "Well, let me do something different.
[00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:12.940]   "And maybe I'll shift to something else in this company.
[00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:16.440]   "Maybe I'll trade accountability for autonomy,
[00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:17.720]   "hold me responsible for my numbers,
[00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:18.940]   "but leave me alone to do my work,
[00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:20.940]   "or maybe I'm gonna leave and go take another job."
[00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:22.820]   But this should be in the way you think about
[00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:24.540]   evaluating how good work is.
[00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:26.580]   It's one of the biggest sources of negativity
[00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:28.280]   that exist in the knowledge work sector.
[00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:30.700]   And it's one that no one actually directly measures
[00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:35.500]   or thinks of as a standalone reason for making a change.
[00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:37.620]   So that's my fourth idea there.
[00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:40.680]   If nothing else works, consider making the change.
[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:46.260]   And that's what I got, Jesse.
[00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:47.780]   - Good advice.
[00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:48.620]   I love it.
[00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:49.900]   - We could talk forever about email.
[00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:53.540]   So I always try to just focus in on one thing at a time.
[00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:56.600]   I mean, actually, this was almost like a frustration
[00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:58.500]   after that New York Times piece came out,
[00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:01.260]   like a minor, good problem to have type of frustration.
[00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:03.020]   So a lot of people wrote me,
[00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:04.620]   'cause a lot of people read the Times.
[00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:06.740]   I'm like, "Man, these ideas are great."
[00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:07.580]   Yeah, like I've been thinking,
[00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:08.700]   "This is true for my office,
[00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:09.900]   "and I haven't thought about that before."
[00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:12.100]   And there's like a lot of good responses like that.
[00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:15.620]   The frustration was, "I wrote a whole book about this."
[00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:17.800]   You know, "I wrote a whole book about this."
[00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:19.340]   'Cause what happened is this book I wrote,
[00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:20.300]   "A World Without Email,"
[00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:21.620]   which I think is really innovative.
[00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:24.060]   I mean, it really introduces this way
[00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:26.580]   of this cognitive centric understanding
[00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:28.980]   of the knowledge work workplace and how to get around it,
[00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:30.820]   came out during the pandemic.
[00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:33.180]   And people were not in the mindset
[00:34:33.180 --> 00:34:36.860]   to think about work processes, right?
[00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:40.240]   Because on the coast, when this came out,
[00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:42.020]   on the coast, people were still,
[00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:43.780]   and their schools were closed,
[00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:47.380]   and it was like they were having nightmares
[00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:48.860]   about like unvaccinated people
[00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:49.780]   breaking into their house
[00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:51.080]   and spreading diseases or whatever.
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:52.860]   And in the other parts of the country,
[00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:54.480]   they were all up in arms about how crazy
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:55.820]   they thought the people on the coast were being.
[00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:56.660]   So they were sort of,
[00:34:56.660 --> 00:34:59.420]   and so there's like political wars going on about COVID.
[00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:02.260]   And there was a presidential election that just happened,
[00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:04.980]   and January 6th that happened.
[00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:07.820]   Come on, this is not the time to be like,
[00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:13.780]   "Excuse me, how often are you checking your email inbox?
[00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:20.920]   "I have some sage advice, some pragmatic suggestions
[00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:24.420]   "about your collaboration protocols."
[00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:29.420]   Like that would have been a great book for 2003.
[00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:31.960]   People are like, "Yeah, generally we feel good,
[00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:33.080]   "and we're kind of optimistic,
[00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:36.160]   "and we wanna kind of make our lives better."
[00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:39.420]   The early spring of 2021, it was,
[00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:42.460]   people were like, "I'm either gonna be dead,
[00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:46.640]   "or we're gonna be in civil war, or whatever."
[00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:47.640]   Way down the list.
[00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:49.640]   So it was kind of frustrating that people I know well,
[00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:52.800]   who should know, I wrote a, they should know about.
[00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:53.640]   - Yeah. - I mean, I write
[00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:55.440]   a lot of books, so I can't really blame them.
[00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:56.380]   But they're like, "Hey, this is cool.
[00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:57.340]   "I've never thought about this."
[00:35:57.340 --> 00:35:59.920]   It's like, "You didn't read my book."
[00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:03.640]   - So do you find any difference between work email accounts
[00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:06.800]   and personal email accounts, or is it just all the same?
[00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:09.360]   - Yeah, I mean, the thing with,
[00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:11.700]   I think with personal email accounts,
[00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:13.480]   the same issues apply, but the pressure
[00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:15.400]   of the hyperactive hive mind is really diluted,
[00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:16.780]   because people understand,
[00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:19.840]   you might not be able to do personal email during work.
[00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:23.000]   So you could look at how people deal with personal email.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   I think people actually naturally drift
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:29.960]   towards these anti-hive mind tactics in personal email,
[00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:32.480]   because the hyperactive hive mind just doesn't work.
[00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:34.360]   Like if I'm talking to a friend,
[00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:35.520]   and we have to work something out,
[00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:38.400]   that's gonna take 15 back and forth messages,
[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:39.720]   that's probably not gonna work in email,
[00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:41.700]   because him and I might not check personal email
[00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:42.600]   except for in the evenings.
[00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:43.560]   Like a lot of people do that,
[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:45.500]   because they're so busy during the day.
[00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:48.900]   We can't take 10 different evenings of back and forth.
[00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:49.740]   So I think in personal email,
[00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:50.900]   people are much more likely to be like,
[00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:52.940]   "I just gotta call you," or text.
[00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:54.180]   I think a lot of people use text
[00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:55.300]   for the personal interactions.
[00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:58.020]   Like, "Can I just ask you this question?"
[00:36:58.020 --> 00:36:59.380]   And they'll say, "Get on the phone."
[00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:01.100]   So we're used to it in personal email.
[00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:03.000]   Don't expect me to be on this all the time.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.360]   The problem with work is that it's plausible
[00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:08.280]   that you could be checking it once every six minutes,
[00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:09.120]   all day long.
[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:09.960]   - Yeah, and that's-
[00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:11.460]   - Because it's plausible, then everyone's like-
[00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:12.300]   - That's where it's from deep work.
[00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:13.620]   - Yeah, it's like, "Let's just do that then."
[00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:14.460]   It's plausible.
[00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:15.700]   - Yeah.
[00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:17.580]   - All right, well, we have a collection of questions
[00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:18.920]   that all roughly deal with this issue.
[00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:20.180]   Before we get to those questions, though,
[00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:22.920]   let me talk about a sponsor
[00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:25.460]   that helps make this show possible,
[00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:29.340]   and that is our friends at Mint Mobile.
[00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:32.280]   The thing about Mint Mobile is,
[00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:36.480]   it is a way to have cell phone service,
[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:39.100]   mobile data service, whatever we call that whole package,
[00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:42.000]   much cheaper than what you would get
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.540]   from one of the major carriers.
[00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:47.040]   It's the easiest way to save this year,
[00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:48.420]   they would even say.
[00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:49.360]   So here's their model.
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:52.380]   They sell premium wireless service to your phone,
[00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:54.780]   like you would get from one of the major providers,
[00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:56.960]   with an online-only model.
[00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:58.340]   None of these storefronts
[00:37:58.340 --> 00:38:00.720]   or expensive infrastructure they have to support,
[00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:03.560]   so they can sell it to you without all that overhead
[00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:06.160]   and at a really good price.
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:08.760]   You can order from home, you do it online.
[00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:10.840]   You can get phone plans that start
[00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:15.840]   at just for as little as $15 a month.
[00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:19.120]   And again, it's online-only, this company,
[00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:22.300]   so they can pass that savings on to you.
[00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:24.560]   That's why these plans are so cheap.
[00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:26.080]   Now, they come with unlimited talk and text,
[00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:27.080]   high-speed data.
[00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:29.340]   They're delivered over the nation's largest 5G network.
[00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:30.680]   So many people are using these same networks,
[00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:32.320]   there's just different names on them.
[00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:34.280]   You can use any phone you want,
[00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:36.440]   just SIM card right in.
[00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:38.920]   So what I have been doing with Mint Mobile,
[00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:40.080]   there's a couple of things you could do with it.
[00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:42.840]   Some people say, "I don't wanna pay whatever I'm paying,
[00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:44.440]   "100 bucks a month with this big carrier.
[00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:47.000]   "I'll do Mint Mobile in my fancy phone,
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.020]   "and it's just cheaper.
[00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:50.120]   "They just send me the SIM card, I stick it in."
[00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:51.320]   What I've been doing with Mint Mobile,
[00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:54.000]   because it can be so affordable,
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.080]   is I use it to support, I'll show it here.
[00:38:57.080 --> 00:38:58.520]   I have the battery out of this phone,
[00:38:58.520 --> 00:38:59.640]   'cause I didn't want anything personal
[00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:01.000]   to show up on the screen.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:02.480]   This is a, I don't know,
[00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:06.000]   this cost me like 50 bucks, a flip phone.
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.800]   So you can buy just off Amazon, like a $50 phone,
[00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:12.200]   get a Mint Mobile subscription for like 15 bucks a month,
[00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:13.760]   get a little SIM card, you stick it in here.
[00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:17.840]   Now you have a dumb phone you can bring with you,
[00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:20.760]   you can be called on and do simple text messages on,
[00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:22.560]   so that you can be disconnected
[00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:24.240]   from the primary distractions of the internet
[00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:26.040]   without being disconnected from the people
[00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:28.360]   that need to reach you.
[00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:31.080]   And so I've been experimenting with dumb phones for,
[00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:32.680]   "Hey, I'm gonna be gone all day.
[00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:34.040]   "I need to maybe see a text message
[00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:35.800]   "or a call from my wife, but that's it.
[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:36.800]   "Let me just bring this."
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:38.440]   Mint Mobile made that possible.
[00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:40.160]   Same thing, you have a kid,
[00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:42.720]   you're like, "I don't wanna give you a smartphone
[00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:46.640]   "because I've seen the kids these days on the TikToks,
[00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:47.960]   "but I need you to be able to text me
[00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:49.800]   "when you need me to pick you up from school."
[00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:52.080]   Mint Mobile makes it so easy, 15 bucks a month,
[00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:53.600]   buy one of these burner flip phones,
[00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:56.240]   not even a burner phone, just like a nice flip phone.
[00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:58.480]   So that's a cool, one of the cool things you can do with it.
[00:39:58.480 --> 00:39:59.880]   That's been my experience.
[00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:01.800]   Anyways, to get your new wireless plan
[00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:03.640]   for just 15 bucks a month,
[00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:06.080]   and to get that plan shipped to your door for free,
[00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:08.320]   go to mintmobile.com/deep,
[00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:10.640]   that's mintmobile.com/deep.
[00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:13.320]   Cut your wireless bill to 15 bucks a month
[00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:16.920]   at mintmobile, M-I-N-T, mobile.com/deep.
[00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:18.920]   Don't forget that, /deep.
[00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:23.640]   I look cool with this phone, don't I, Jesse?
[00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:24.480]   - Yeah.
[00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:27.680]   - I look like a cool Wall Street guy in like 1994.
[00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:28.680]   - I was checking it out.
[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:29.760]   - Sell. - I like it.
[00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:33.440]   - Sell my stock in geo cities.
[00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:34.360]   - I like this phone.
[00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:36.880]   I noticed after I bought it that the numbers are very big.
[00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:37.920]   So I'm thinking like this,
[00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:40.040]   I think the primary market might've been older people.
[00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:40.880]   - Yeah.
[00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:41.700]   - I like it though.
[00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:42.540]   Keep it simple.
[00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:44.120]   I also wanna talk briefly about another one
[00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:48.880]   of our newer sponsors, and that is Huel, H-U-E-L.
[00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:50.940]   In particular, I wanna talk about Huel Black Edition,
[00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:54.800]   which is a high protein, nutritionally complete meal
[00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:57.160]   that you can consume in a convenient shake.
[00:40:57.160 --> 00:40:59.080]   It means everything your body needs in just two scoops,
[00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:01.200]   including 27 essential vitamins and minerals,
[00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:03.480]   and 40 grams of protein.
[00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:05.200]   I have talked about this on the show a lot.
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:08.980]   Here's my strategy for healthy eating.
[00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:10.720]   Automate what you do before dinner.
[00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:13.040]   So you don't have to think about it.
[00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:15.000]   It gives you what you need, and it's simple.
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:19.080]   So for me, either I skip breakfast or I just Huel.
[00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:21.080]   All right, I got protein, I got the calories,
[00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:21.960]   I got the vitamins.
[00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:23.960]   It takes me seven seconds to put together.
[00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:25.960]   I scoop, scoop, shake, go.
[00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:27.180]   So I don't have to spend any time on it.
[00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:28.680]   I don't even have to think about it.
[00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:30.900]   I have like two things I eat for lunch.
[00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:32.240]   That I know are good for me.
[00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:34.360]   One comes from one place, another comes from another place.
[00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:35.640]   I have my option, and that's it.
[00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:37.440]   I never think about it.
[00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:39.760]   And then dinner, that's where you can actually,
[00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:41.200]   if you appreciate food, like, okay,
[00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:42.240]   what are we cooking tonight?
[00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:44.040]   And I'm into it, and we bought this fresh fish.
[00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:45.160]   And you can enjoy dinner,
[00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:46.580]   and that's when you can think about enjoy food.
[00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:48.400]   But during the workday, just automate it.
[00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:52.400]   And having a really good, high quality, healthy,
[00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:54.400]   easy to use meal replacement shake
[00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:57.520]   is a great way to automate these type of meals.
[00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:00.520]   So I use Huel when I wanna replace my breakfast.
[00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:03.280]   Two scoops, and it goes right in.
[00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:04.800]   All sorts of junk in here.
[00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:06.440]   And by junk, I mean great things.
[00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:10.880]   Vitamin C, calcium, omega-3, iron, magnesium,
[00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:15.060]   protein, B12, B6, zinc, fiber, right?
[00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:16.280]   So, you know, this is a shake,
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:18.280]   but you get the fiber in there for digestive health.
[00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:22.160]   So you just take that shake, replace one of your meals.
[00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:24.340]   Yeah, it saves time, but it also saves you
[00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:27.040]   from that cognitive decision-making energy
[00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:28.080]   you would otherwise have to waste
[00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:29.960]   thinking about what should I eat for breakfast?
[00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:32.120]   And you end up eating the bad things.
[00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:34.440]   So I'm glad to have Huel as a sponsor.
[00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:38.360]   Helps my in the day meal automation plan.
[00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:39.920]   Got a website for you.
[00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:44.400]   Go to, I have it over here, huel.com/questions.
[00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:47.920]   That's H-U-E-L.com/questions.
[00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:49.280]   Do the slash questions because A,
[00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:50.300]   then they know you came for me,
[00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:52.760]   but two or B, you got A and two,
[00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:55.380]   B, you'll get a free t-shirt and the shaker
[00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:57.640]   you can use to shake up the shake.
[00:42:57.640 --> 00:42:59.400]   So it's huel.com/questions.
[00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:05.080]   All right, Jesse, let's do some questions from our listeners.
[00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:05.920]   - All right, sounds great.
[00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:07.520]   First question's from Sharon.
[00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:10.760]   Why do you recommend setting up different email accounts
[00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:12.280]   as opposed to setting up filters
[00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:15.720]   to auto-sort emails in the respective roles?
[00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:17.160]   - Yes, as long-time listeners know,
[00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:20.080]   I'm a big fan of having completely separate email accounts
[00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:22.860]   for separate roles.
[00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:24.740]   Let me think how many email accounts I have right now.
[00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:28.800]   I have a personal account at Gmail.
[00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:32.040]   I have a calnewport.com account.
[00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:36.600]   I have a Georgetown account and I have a New Yorker account.
[00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:41.600]   So yeah, I have four accounts, all different.
[00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:46.120]   In fact, I have a separate Google Chrome context
[00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:47.320]   for each of those.
[00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:49.120]   Most of these actually require me
[00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:50.720]   to do two-factor authentication.
[00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:52.400]   So it's not easy to log in.
[00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:53.600]   Why do I do that?
[00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:55.200]   Because it's not easy to log in.
[00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:59.180]   If what you do instead is just say,
[00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:01.480]   let me have all these different emails for different roles
[00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:05.320]   come into the same inbox and I'll just filter it
[00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:07.120]   into folders or if I'm using Gmail,
[00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:08.880]   I can filter it into labels.
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:11.280]   And then I just have one inbox,
[00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:14.360]   but I've separated things into different folders or labels.
[00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:15.420]   I used to do this.
[00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:20.600]   The problem with it is if I am logged into one email inbox
[00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:22.500]   and I have these five different filters
[00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:24.440]   or five different folders,
[00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:26.960]   I'm gonna click, click, click, click, click.
[00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:28.840]   I used to call it the wheel of checks.
[00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:31.360]   It's psychologically almost impossible
[00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:33.000]   when you've logged into an email inbox,
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:34.280]   not to just click, click, click, click, click
[00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:35.860]   and see what's coming to those other ones too.
[00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:37.520]   It's too easy.
[00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:39.820]   It takes too much willpower to not just click once
[00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:42.280]   and see if there's any work-related emails coming in.
[00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:45.240]   So my attempts to try to filter emails in a single inbox
[00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:48.800]   into separate bins did not actually have the desired effect
[00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:51.580]   of me separating these into completely separate contexts.
[00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:53.940]   I would check them all at the same time.
[00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:56.460]   Now that I literally do use separate inboxes
[00:44:56.460 --> 00:44:57.520]   with separate sign-ins
[00:44:57.520 --> 00:45:00.300]   and for some of these two-factor authentication,
[00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:04.480]   I can easily check one from the other.
[00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:06.360]   I go to check this one email,
[00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:08.280]   it's not easy for me to check the other.
[00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:09.440]   I'm gonna have to get a password.
[00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:10.360]   I'm gonna have to type something in.
[00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:11.200]   I'm gonna have to get my phone.
[00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:12.440]   I'm gonna have to press something.
[00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:13.600]   This is really important
[00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:16.680]   because it keeps context sacrosanct.
[00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:19.280]   When I'm working on Georgetown stuff,
[00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:21.480]   I'm just in my Georgetown email.
[00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:25.400]   So my overarching cognitive context is Georgetown-related.
[00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:26.240]   And that's good.
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:27.380]   I want to stay in that context
[00:45:27.380 --> 00:45:28.940]   and while I'm working on stuff in that context,
[00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:32.180]   I don't want to also see a deep questions-related question
[00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:33.500]   while I'm in the Georgetown context.
[00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:36.540]   I don't also wanna see an email from my uncle
[00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:38.340]   while I'm in the Georgetown context.
[00:45:38.340 --> 00:45:41.340]   And that allows me to actually accomplish things
[00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:43.380]   when I'm working on it faster and with higher quality
[00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:45.540]   and with less subjective disease
[00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:46.860]   because I'm stuck in there,
[00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:48.980]   I'm staying within the same context.
[00:45:48.980 --> 00:45:49.940]   So if you have different roles,
[00:45:49.940 --> 00:45:53.740]   if you can separate them in a separate email inboxes, do so.
[00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:55.900]   If it's a pain, good.
[00:45:55.900 --> 00:45:57.660]   You want that friction to be high.
[00:45:57.660 --> 00:45:59.140]   I mean, I don't know if this happens for you, Jesse,
[00:45:59.140 --> 00:46:02.820]   but for me, for our calnewport.com account,
[00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:05.840]   it's constantly requiring me to retype in the password.
[00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:07.620]   This happens to me.
[00:46:07.620 --> 00:46:08.820]   - It happens to me too.
[00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:10.060]   - Yeah, like once a week, it'll be like,
[00:46:10.060 --> 00:46:12.260]   we wanna make sure it's still you.
[00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:13.180]   Like it doesn't want you to,
[00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:15.580]   we must have a setting, which I think is good.
[00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:18.220]   It doesn't want you to be logged in too long.
[00:46:18.220 --> 00:46:19.940]   And I have a really complicated password.
[00:46:19.940 --> 00:46:23.220]   And so I have to go and find it and I have to type it in.
[00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:24.780]   And I think that's all great actually.
[00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:28.100]   So now I've learned it's no casual thing to just,
[00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:30.340]   let me just jump over to calnewport.com and check my emails.
[00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:31.940]   Like I might have to go find the stupid password
[00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:32.780]   and do all this stuff.
[00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:35.500]   So I wait to do it until like I'm prepping the show
[00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:37.140]   or doing something specific for the show
[00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:39.020]   and context are kept clean.
[00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:41.740]   So I like that.
[00:46:41.740 --> 00:46:43.900]   I mean, someone should invent like a Gmail plugin
[00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:47.100]   where you have to do 15 pushups
[00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:50.860]   before to log in or something like this.
[00:46:50.860 --> 00:46:52.580]   People get way better at email.
[00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:54.220]   All right, what do we got next, Jesse?
[00:46:54.220 --> 00:46:55.740]   - All right, next question is from Marcia,
[00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:57.740]   an analyst from Minnesota.
[00:46:57.740 --> 00:47:00.060]   When I try to use process centric emails,
[00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:03.060]   I often get feedback like it was too long to read
[00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:05.620]   or I skipped the rest after the first line.
[00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:08.780]   How do I get people to actually read my emails?
[00:47:08.780 --> 00:47:11.060]   - I think you gotta lecture them more, Marcia.
[00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:13.460]   Like you fools.
[00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:16.540]   My emails are gold.
[00:47:16.540 --> 00:47:18.740]   How dare you defile my brilliance?
[00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:21.180]   It's a good question.
[00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:23.020]   So we talked about process centric emails
[00:47:23.020 --> 00:47:23.980]   earlier in this episode,
[00:47:23.980 --> 00:47:26.260]   where you lay out in your email to someone
[00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:28.780]   the whole process by which the collaboration
[00:47:28.780 --> 00:47:32.540]   being initiated by that message will unfold.
[00:47:32.540 --> 00:47:35.780]   Marcia, what you're noting here happens often.
[00:47:35.780 --> 00:47:38.420]   For people who are completely up to their eyeballs
[00:47:38.420 --> 00:47:41.300]   in the hyperactive hive mind collaboration method,
[00:47:41.300 --> 00:47:43.220]   they're just typing emails out
[00:47:43.220 --> 00:47:45.500]   as fast as their keys can hit those keys.
[00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:47.180]   It's all obligation hot potato.
[00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:49.100]   They just like, I gotta get this out of here.
[00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:50.300]   I'll just, you know,
[00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:52.580]   me no like thoughts, question marks, send, right?
[00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:56.220]   Just whatever gets the email out of their box temporarily
[00:47:56.220 --> 00:47:58.500]   and get that little bit of relief they're just doing.
[00:47:58.500 --> 00:47:59.700]   You know, I mean, some emails,
[00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:01.300]   it's just, they just smash the keyboard
[00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:04.220]   and it's just random characters, send, whatever.
[00:48:04.220 --> 00:48:05.540]   They could probably do an anagram
[00:48:05.540 --> 00:48:07.020]   and find a question in there.
[00:48:07.020 --> 00:48:09.780]   For someone who's in that attitude,
[00:48:09.780 --> 00:48:12.700]   a process centric email message is gonna be
[00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:14.780]   like a slap to the face.
[00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:18.340]   Like, am I gonna read, what, what?
[00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:20.940]   I just wanna be, you know, me no think,
[00:48:20.940 --> 00:48:24.060]   Friday Zoom, teams, teams, teams, send.
[00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:25.620]   What, I'm not gonna read three paragraphs.
[00:48:25.620 --> 00:48:26.460]   I can't do that, right?
[00:48:26.460 --> 00:48:29.980]   So it is difficult because they're not used to that.
[00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:30.860]   They're used to everything
[00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:32.420]   as part of a long back and forth conversation.
[00:48:32.420 --> 00:48:34.380]   You wanna get out of there as quick as possible.
[00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:36.540]   So you have two things you can do here.
[00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:40.140]   One, and this is simple, but it really is effective.
[00:48:40.140 --> 00:48:42.500]   Break the process part away
[00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:44.780]   from the colloquial communication part.
[00:48:44.780 --> 00:48:48.260]   So up top, real quick.
[00:48:48.260 --> 00:48:49.460]   Yeah, I agree, we gotta get into this.
[00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:51.660]   Hey, I put below,
[00:48:51.660 --> 00:48:55.380]   I put below how I think we get this done.
[00:48:55.380 --> 00:48:57.100]   See you tomorrow or whatever.
[00:48:57.100 --> 00:48:58.380]   Thumbs up, your name.
[00:48:58.380 --> 00:48:59.540]   So you have like a colloquial message
[00:48:59.540 --> 00:49:00.820]   they're comfortable with at top.
[00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:02.540]   And then you can put, you know, use equal signs
[00:49:02.540 --> 00:49:05.380]   and make like a horizontal line and it's down below.
[00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:06.860]   And then the whole process is listed below.
[00:49:06.860 --> 00:49:08.900]   So it almost feels like an attachment.
[00:49:08.900 --> 00:49:10.580]   Psychologically, that's easier for people.
[00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:11.860]   Oh, there's like a quick message, like, yeah,
[00:49:11.860 --> 00:49:13.540]   let's do it, I put a process we'll follow.
[00:49:13.540 --> 00:49:14.860]   It's attached, see you tomorrow.
[00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:17.140]   And they're like, okay, I get this.
[00:49:17.140 --> 00:49:17.980]   That looks familiar.
[00:49:17.980 --> 00:49:19.540]   Oh, and then down here is something separate.
[00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:21.820]   It's like a multi-step, five-step process.
[00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:22.820]   I'll have to, you know, at some point
[00:49:22.820 --> 00:49:25.100]   go through there and read that.
[00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:25.940]   The second thing you could do
[00:49:25.940 --> 00:49:29.220]   is actually put it in a separate, get it out of email.
[00:49:29.220 --> 00:49:30.740]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:49:30.740 --> 00:49:32.020]   We probably should have a plan for how to do this.
[00:49:32.020 --> 00:49:34.580]   I came up with one, here's the link, it's in Google Drive.
[00:49:34.580 --> 00:49:35.460]   Feel free to edit it,
[00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:37.580]   but otherwise I'm gonna start executing it.
[00:49:37.580 --> 00:49:39.780]   So they can't even see it in the email.
[00:49:39.780 --> 00:49:41.380]   So they can expect, okay, yeah, you know,
[00:49:41.380 --> 00:49:44.500]   me liking, press send or whatever they do, right?
[00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:45.820]   But the information has been delivered.
[00:49:45.820 --> 00:49:46.700]   And then when they go and read it,
[00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:47.700]   they're in a different context.
[00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:49.300]   They're in a Google Doc to read the process.
[00:49:49.300 --> 00:49:51.260]   And they're used to Google Docs being long.
[00:49:51.260 --> 00:49:54.220]   And so psychologically in that frame, it's easier to take.
[00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:58.380]   So separate out the process you're giving people
[00:49:58.380 --> 00:49:59.380]   from the message.
[00:49:59.380 --> 00:50:01.020]   Great, let's try this, see you tomorrow.
[00:50:01.020 --> 00:50:03.060]   And then down below, you can have the thing.
[00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:03.980]   Here's what we're gonna do.
[00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:05.860]   I'm gonna look at this until close of business this day.
[00:50:05.860 --> 00:50:07.700]   You have these days to do it.
[00:50:07.700 --> 00:50:09.580]   Add your comments straight in there.
[00:50:09.580 --> 00:50:12.340]   And then let's have a call on Thursday to discuss it.
[00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:14.220]   Here's the time I suggest, if that doesn't work,
[00:50:14.220 --> 00:50:16.860]   here's three backups, just reply with the right one bolded
[00:50:16.860 --> 00:50:18.180]   or just write it at the top of the doc,
[00:50:18.180 --> 00:50:19.160]   whatever it is, right?
[00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:21.180]   It's separated from your message.
[00:50:21.180 --> 00:50:22.460]   You're treating it like an attachment,
[00:50:22.460 --> 00:50:24.100]   like a document, like a report.
[00:50:24.100 --> 00:50:27.820]   It's the same information, different frame.
[00:50:27.820 --> 00:50:30.580]   People might be more likely to read it.
[00:50:30.580 --> 00:50:32.900]   The final thing I'll say is don't give up.
[00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:35.700]   So you're like, I don't know, now let's just,
[00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:36.780]   like they're kind of just ignoring it
[00:50:36.780 --> 00:50:38.620]   and trying to send messages back.
[00:50:38.620 --> 00:50:40.980]   Be nice, but be like, yeah, well,
[00:50:40.980 --> 00:50:42.700]   just let's follow this process.
[00:50:42.700 --> 00:50:44.060]   Yeah, here I attach the process.
[00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:46.820]   So here's the link to what I think we should do.
[00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:48.500]   And just keep coming back to it.
[00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:50.420]   Like, don't be a pain about it.
[00:50:50.420 --> 00:50:52.700]   Just be like, yeah, here's, I came up with a process.
[00:50:52.700 --> 00:50:54.420]   Here's what I think we should do.
[00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:56.340]   I've did the first step, you know?
[00:50:56.340 --> 00:51:01.100]   And at first they might not do it and be like, okay,
[00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:03.300]   hey, look, I see you didn't do this.
[00:51:03.300 --> 00:51:05.340]   I can assume you didn't have any,
[00:51:05.340 --> 00:51:07.740]   you didn't have any feedback here or something like this.
[00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:09.660]   So I just went ahead and did it.
[00:51:09.660 --> 00:51:12.700]   Or we had, I told the boss, like, we didn't have this done
[00:51:12.700 --> 00:51:13.780]   because you didn't get this done.
[00:51:13.780 --> 00:51:14.660]   Right, so they see there was like
[00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:15.620]   some sort of consequence around.
[00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:17.260]   Again, you're being nice, you're not being a jerk about it,
[00:51:17.260 --> 00:51:18.220]   but you just kind of keep going back.
[00:51:18.220 --> 00:51:19.100]   Like, this is how I work.
[00:51:19.100 --> 00:51:22.020]   I figure out like, what's our steps for doing this?
[00:51:22.020 --> 00:51:23.420]   And then I try to follow the steps.
[00:51:23.420 --> 00:51:25.780]   And if you ignore the steps or skip the steps,
[00:51:25.780 --> 00:51:27.020]   it's not like it just goes away.
[00:51:27.020 --> 00:51:29.620]   It's like, okay, either you get taken out of the project
[00:51:29.620 --> 00:51:31.260]   or the boss has to hear that we didn't get it done.
[00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:33.660]   And eventually you want people to kind of turn around,
[00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:34.940]   but don't give up and just be like,
[00:51:34.940 --> 00:51:36.660]   I guess I'll just go back and hive mind everything.
[00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:37.700]   Right, it's not your problem
[00:51:37.700 --> 00:51:39.260]   that other people are hive minded.
[00:51:39.260 --> 00:51:42.340]   Don't be a jerk about it, but don't give up on it either.
[00:51:42.340 --> 00:51:44.260]   But again, I'm telling you,
[00:51:44.260 --> 00:51:47.500]   dash, dash, dash, and you put the steps below your message,
[00:51:47.500 --> 00:51:50.500]   it seems so stupid, but it can often make a huge difference.
[00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:54.420]   All right, Jesse, where we got?
[00:51:54.420 --> 00:51:57.020]   - All right, next question is from Rochelle.
[00:51:57.020 --> 00:51:58.660]   I've been increasingly hardcore
[00:51:58.660 --> 00:52:00.660]   about implementing your advice recently,
[00:52:00.660 --> 00:52:03.260]   but I've encountered an unexpected side effect.
[00:52:03.260 --> 00:52:05.900]   Some coworkers tell me that they actually prefer
[00:52:05.900 --> 00:52:08.160]   having many email check-ins and get angry
[00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:11.700]   when I jump the gun and start executing tasks.
[00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:15.140]   How can I stay productive and sane without stepping on toes?
[00:52:15.140 --> 00:52:19.180]   - I know what you're talking about, Rochelle,
[00:52:19.180 --> 00:52:23.660]   and I actually have a little bit of empathy for them.
[00:52:23.660 --> 00:52:25.360]   Like I understand their complaint.
[00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:28.620]   Like there's two things going on here.
[00:52:28.620 --> 00:52:31.540]   They have maybe more of a hyperactive,
[00:52:31.540 --> 00:52:33.140]   hive mind approach to collaboration.
[00:52:33.140 --> 00:52:34.620]   We'll just sort of figure things out back and forth
[00:52:34.620 --> 00:52:35.980]   with email, a slower approach.
[00:52:35.980 --> 00:52:37.820]   And you're thinking like, let's just roll.
[00:52:37.820 --> 00:52:38.700]   We're doing a meeting.
[00:52:38.700 --> 00:52:41.380]   Let me just order the food, get the caterer going.
[00:52:41.380 --> 00:52:45.100]   I get that, but they also probably feel
[00:52:45.100 --> 00:52:46.680]   as if they're being cut out of a process
[00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:47.900]   or if mistakes are gonna be made
[00:52:47.900 --> 00:52:49.860]   because they haven't had a chance to talk to you
[00:52:49.860 --> 00:52:51.620]   and you ordered all the food,
[00:52:51.620 --> 00:52:53.140]   but you didn't talk to them first
[00:52:53.140 --> 00:52:54.300]   and they could have told you
[00:52:54.300 --> 00:52:56.940]   that the guest who's coming to speak is vegetarian.
[00:52:56.940 --> 00:52:59.620]   And so we need to order from this other place over there.
[00:52:59.620 --> 00:53:01.240]   So they have legitimate reasons
[00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:05.260]   to want to actually have a chance to talk about things
[00:53:05.260 --> 00:53:06.980]   before action is taken.
[00:53:06.980 --> 00:53:09.180]   So what we have to do is thread this needle,
[00:53:09.180 --> 00:53:12.900]   give people a chance to actually interact with you,
[00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:15.420]   let these things unfold at a pace
[00:53:15.420 --> 00:53:18.080]   that they will follow as well,
[00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:20.220]   without you being beholden to an inbox,
[00:53:20.220 --> 00:53:21.620]   without you having to just sort of like
[00:53:21.620 --> 00:53:22.780]   always be sending emails
[00:53:22.780 --> 00:53:25.620]   and kind of doing things ad hoc, like most people do.
[00:53:25.620 --> 00:53:27.180]   So one thing I'm gonna suggest,
[00:53:27.180 --> 00:53:30.500]   and the first part won't be that surprising,
[00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:31.960]   you figure out upfront, okay,
[00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:35.640]   what are my responsibilities in this thing we're working on?
[00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:37.160]   And figure out some sort of,
[00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:39.120]   and this word's not gonna surprise you,
[00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:41.440]   process by which you're gonna get that work done.
[00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:42.360]   You kind of bring them up to speed.
[00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:44.160]   Okay, here's what I'm gonna do.
[00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:46.080]   I'll take care of the food for this meeting.
[00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:47.500]   I'll take care of the conference room.
[00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:51.040]   I'll take care of getting the promotional materials out.
[00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:53.600]   Here is how I'm gonna do that.
[00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:56.280]   And so you bring them up to speed right off the bat
[00:53:56.280 --> 00:53:58.160]   about when and how you're gonna do things
[00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:00.200]   so that they know the plan up front.
[00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:01.240]   You're moving it out of,
[00:54:01.240 --> 00:54:03.600]   we'll just sort of rock and roll on the fly.
[00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:07.440]   Two, when you send out this process
[00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:10.800]   for whatever collaborative project you're working on,
[00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:14.700]   lean towards what I call feedback options
[00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:17.760]   versus feedback checkpoints.
[00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:22.140]   So a feedback checkpoint is before I order the food,
[00:54:22.140 --> 00:54:27.340]   we can talk to make sure we're satisfying whatever,
[00:54:27.340 --> 00:54:29.120]   dietary needs or see what you think
[00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:30.520]   would be the best food to order.
[00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:32.760]   That's a choke point or a checkpoint I mean.
[00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:34.940]   Everyone has to come together and gather
[00:54:34.940 --> 00:54:37.200]   before you can make progress going forward.
[00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:38.920]   We all have to wait and gather at this checkpoint
[00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:40.520]   and then we can keep moving forward.
[00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:44.680]   A feedback option gives people the option
[00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:47.040]   to provide you feedback, but even if they don't,
[00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:48.840]   you can still move forward.
[00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:53.320]   So here we might say, if you have any thoughts
[00:54:53.320 --> 00:54:55.360]   about the food or what food should be ordered,
[00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:58.320]   I'm gonna order on Wednesday before the event
[00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:01.040]   in the afternoon.
[00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:04.440]   Send me any like issues or dietary restrictions
[00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:06.920]   or whatever by that point,
[00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:09.320]   or I have a document that we're planning the product in,
[00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:10.720]   this is the space for it.
[00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:12.960]   Put that all in there before the time I listed
[00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:14.180]   because that's what I'm actually gonna go in
[00:55:14.180 --> 00:55:15.200]   and make the food order.
[00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:17.960]   You can even set up a reminder about that
[00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:21.760]   to send automatically, you know, the morning of.
[00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:23.840]   Hey, by the way, remember,
[00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:25.600]   if you have any thoughts on the food or feedback,
[00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:28.000]   I'm ordering tonight.
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:31.600]   Feedback options work great because people feel included.
[00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:34.280]   If there's something important that they do want you to know
[00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:37.480]   they will then make sure they get you that information,
[00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:39.580]   but it allows you to actually move forward
[00:55:39.580 --> 00:55:41.120]   without being beholden to just going
[00:55:41.120 --> 00:55:43.040]   with back and forth emails, waiting for replies,
[00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:44.800]   being stuck inside your inbox.
[00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:47.640]   90% of the time, people don't actually have feedback
[00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:48.760]   on these things they wanna give you.
[00:55:48.760 --> 00:55:51.240]   It's just the idea that they might, that upsets them.
[00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:53.060]   I don't like that you ordered this food
[00:55:53.060 --> 00:55:55.200]   without talking to us because what if
[00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:59.500]   we were inviting gremlins and it's after nine,
[00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:00.340]   if they get water,
[00:56:00.340 --> 00:56:01.800]   they're gonna turn into monsters, right?
[00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:03.680]   That's not what's happening, but it could have.
[00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:07.080]   So, you know, I'm upset you didn't talk to us ahead of time.
[00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:09.760]   With a feedback option, you take that concern away.
[00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:10.920]   Like, oh, I could have told you,
[00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:12.760]   hey, by the way, no water, it's gremlins.
[00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:13.960]   You told me how to say that.
[00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:15.340]   You told me when you're ordering it.
[00:56:15.340 --> 00:56:16.920]   You gave me a place to tell you that information.
[00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:18.220]   So I'm not upset about it.
[00:56:18.220 --> 00:56:20.400]   So you wanna have a process,
[00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:23.320]   especially for logistical type gatherings like this.
[00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:24.280]   And I should say, by the way,
[00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:25.560]   I keep using this food example
[00:56:25.560 --> 00:56:28.960]   because in the elaboration of this question,
[00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:32.920]   Rochelle gave a particular example about like ordering food
[00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:33.960]   and her colleagues got mad at her
[00:56:33.960 --> 00:56:35.000]   for ordering it right away.
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:37.020]   So that's why I'm using that example.
[00:56:37.020 --> 00:56:39.800]   But use feedback options instead of feedback choke points.
[00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:42.280]   Tell people ahead of time, this is how I'm doing it.
[00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:43.700]   People will be happy.
[00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:45.520]   In the rare cases where you need feedback, you'll get it.
[00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:48.680]   And now you can still execute without having to be stuck
[00:56:48.680 --> 00:56:50.600]   waiting for random emails to come back,
[00:56:50.600 --> 00:56:53.280]   waiting for random email replies to make it back to you.
[00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:57.240]   All right, these are nice and practical, Jesse.
[00:56:57.240 --> 00:56:58.080]   I like these.
[00:56:58.080 --> 00:57:01.220]   It's really in the trenches type of issues.
[00:57:01.220 --> 00:57:03.680]   All right, who do we got next?
[00:57:03.680 --> 00:57:06.040]   - All right, next question's from Rippy
[00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:09.840]   and a board at an Abaris from Minneapolis.
[00:57:09.840 --> 00:57:12.620]   What do you do when you started a correspondence over email,
[00:57:12.620 --> 00:57:14.560]   transferred all relevant information
[00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:16.600]   to another system like Trello
[00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:19.220]   and yet must continue to correspond over email
[00:57:19.220 --> 00:57:20.360]   with your client?
[00:57:20.360 --> 00:57:22.320]   Do you invite them to a shared Trello board
[00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:25.920]   or keep manually transferring information back and forth?
[00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:29.480]   - You manually transfer information back and forth.
[00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:33.300]   So yes, I advise your inbox
[00:57:33.300 --> 00:57:35.640]   is not a knowledge management system.
[00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:37.320]   All the information relevant to understand
[00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:38.880]   everything you're doing and the status
[00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:41.440]   should all be in other types of systems.
[00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:42.960]   Your email inbox is just an interface
[00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:45.360]   to which information comes in and out.
[00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:47.800]   And so it gets transferred out of there.
[00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:50.360]   So I mean, a client writes you and whatever
[00:57:50.360 --> 00:57:54.000]   has some notes for when we update our contract,
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:55.380]   I wanna, we should worry about,
[00:57:55.380 --> 00:57:57.200]   so he's an Arborist, something about tree ideas here.
[00:57:57.200 --> 00:57:58.420]   Oh, we should worry about the black elm
[00:57:58.420 --> 00:57:59.260]   or something like that.
[00:57:59.260 --> 00:58:02.480]   And you go to, you have a Trello board for your clients
[00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:05.640]   and you have a column for that particular client.
[00:58:05.640 --> 00:58:08.560]   Maybe it's things to discuss the next contract.
[00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:10.800]   You throw in a card and you copy that stuff out of the email
[00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:12.320]   and you throw it in that card and now it's there
[00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:13.880]   and you can archive that email.
[00:58:14.720 --> 00:58:17.640]   So you're transferring stuff from email to Trello.
[00:58:17.640 --> 00:58:18.760]   Then you're looking at your Trello board
[00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:19.960]   when you're doing your weekly plan
[00:58:19.960 --> 00:58:22.840]   and you see, I'll have to send a contract to this client
[00:58:22.840 --> 00:58:24.040]   and I have all the information there.
[00:58:24.040 --> 00:58:26.480]   And so I'll have to pull all that information out of Trello
[00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:29.240]   and write up the contract and email it to my client.
[00:58:29.240 --> 00:58:30.080]   That's just what you do.
[00:58:30.080 --> 00:58:32.260]   You go back and forth and it's high friction,
[00:58:32.260 --> 00:58:34.260]   but I don't mind, so what?
[00:58:34.260 --> 00:58:38.120]   I don't want email to be super low friction.
[00:58:38.120 --> 00:58:40.600]   And this is the biggest issue we have
[00:58:41.600 --> 00:58:45.520]   with the fact that our primary technologies
[00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:49.120]   by which we organize ourselves as human in the workplace
[00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:52.640]   come from engineers from a setting
[00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:55.120]   where the most important thing is efficiency.
[00:58:55.120 --> 00:58:57.240]   I want my processor to tick faster.
[00:58:57.240 --> 00:58:59.400]   I want the predictive pipeline to be longer.
[00:58:59.400 --> 00:59:02.320]   I want the microseconds per operation
[00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:04.760]   to be even smaller, right?
[00:59:04.760 --> 00:59:06.000]   I mean, when you're an engineer,
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:07.480]   especially in digital engineering,
[00:59:07.480 --> 00:59:09.760]   everything you're looking for speed and efficiency.
[00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:12.480]   How can I pack more bits of data
[00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:15.400]   into the given frequency bandwidth that I have?
[00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:18.840]   More and less efficiency, efficiency, efficiency.
[00:59:18.840 --> 00:59:21.100]   And so we think, oh, how do we make humans
[00:59:21.100 --> 00:59:22.540]   who are working together using the tools
[00:59:22.540 --> 00:59:24.640]   that we're programming more productive?
[00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:26.600]   We got to make things more efficient.
[00:59:26.600 --> 00:59:28.240]   Like our issue is we're not efficient enough.
[00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:30.280]   Maybe we could have an artificial intelligence agents
[00:59:30.280 --> 00:59:31.980]   that could automatically pull the information
[00:59:31.980 --> 00:59:33.600]   out of our email and move it to a Trello card
[00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:34.800]   and it saves us from having to do that.
[00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:36.480]   And that's a minute that otherwise would it take.
[00:59:36.480 --> 00:59:37.760]   That's not our problem.
[00:59:38.640 --> 00:59:40.140]   We are not computer processors
[00:59:40.140 --> 00:59:42.880]   that need to take 20% off our average operation time
[00:59:42.880 --> 00:59:46.680]   so that we can charge a premium compared to our competitor.
[00:59:46.680 --> 00:59:48.240]   We're humans working with other humans
[00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:51.360]   to focus our mind and add value to information
[00:59:51.360 --> 00:59:53.300]   through cognition.
[00:59:53.300 --> 00:59:57.320]   So our issue is not, I'm in email mode.
[00:59:57.320 --> 00:59:59.840]   Let me take this information and transfer the Trello,
[00:59:59.840 --> 01:00:00.680]   see what's going on.
[01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:02.080]   In fact, we want that to take a little bit of time.
[01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:03.160]   We're in that context.
[01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:04.080]   We want to be deliberate.
[01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:05.800]   We want to have a good sense of what's going on.
[01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:07.080]   And then when we work on something,
[01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:08.120]   we just work on that thing.
[01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:08.940]   We get that done.
[01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:09.780]   We come back and forth.
[01:00:09.780 --> 01:00:10.600]   So forget this friction stuff,
[01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:13.640]   forget this going as fast as possible stuff.
[01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:14.880]   Don't live in your inbox,
[01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:16.580]   move that information to a system.
[01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:18.120]   It's deliberate, be deliberate.
[01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:20.840]   And if you find there's so much information
[01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:21.680]   going back and forth,
[01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:23.680]   that it's like you're spending all day going in Trello,
[01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:25.400]   that's a hyperactive hive mind problem.
[01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:27.360]   You got to re-engineer your client communication,
[01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:28.280]   your client processes,
[01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:30.080]   so you don't just have emails back and forth all day.
[01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:31.300]   That's a separate problem.
[01:00:31.300 --> 01:00:34.020]   But I am not worried about the fact that you,
[01:00:34.020 --> 01:00:36.000]   stuff in your inbox has to get manually transferred
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000]   somewhere else and then manually transferred
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:38.960]   from there back into your inbox.
[01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:41.240]   A little bit of friction is not that bad of a thing.
[01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:44.840]   Arborist.
[01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:46.320]   All right, let's,
[01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:47.240]   you can do one more, Jesse.
[01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:48.200]   Let's do one more question.
[01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:49.640]   - Sounds good.
[01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:53.200]   Next question is from Walter G, an attorney from Arizona.
[01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:56.440]   My office promoted me to a supervisor position
[01:00:56.440 --> 01:00:58.920]   as an assistant federal public defender.
[01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:00.440]   The transition has been difficult
[01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:03.120]   because management expects me to be open
[01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:05.020]   to calls and office stop buys
[01:01:05.020 --> 01:01:08.360]   from supervisors between eight and 5 p.m.
[01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:11.920]   How can I find time to work deeply without interruption?
[01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:16.360]   - Well, I mean, Walter, there's two options here.
[01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:20.200]   You either cede the responsibilities to require deep work.
[01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:24.880]   So you make the role purely supervisory.
[01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:27.680]   I supervise people and answer questions,
[01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:29.040]   or you change the policy.
[01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:33.440]   There's not a world in which
[01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:35.420]   the expectations can be,
[01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:36.980]   there's things you need to do for us
[01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:38.100]   that are cognitively demanding,
[01:01:38.100 --> 01:01:40.840]   like writing briefs or preparing cases,
[01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:43.340]   but also your door always has to be open,
[01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:45.420]   your phone always has to be on, right?
[01:01:45.420 --> 01:01:47.780]   I mean, to me, that's like, I'm a baseball player
[01:01:47.780 --> 01:01:50.420]   and the manager says,
[01:01:50.420 --> 01:01:53.980]   "Look, you gotta wear these blacked out goggles."
[01:01:53.980 --> 01:01:56.200]   And I say, "But I can't see when I have them on."
[01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:57.500]   And they say, "Yeah, but they're a sponsor.
[01:01:57.500 --> 01:01:58.500]   It's important that you wear them."
[01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:00.700]   And you say, "Well, I can't play baseball
[01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:02.300]   and wear blacked out goggles.
[01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:04.000]   So we're gonna have to figure out something else.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.400]   Maybe I'll put them on in the dugout
[01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:06.280]   when the camera's on us.
[01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:08.200]   And when I'm in the outfield, I'll take them off."
[01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:10.740]   But it's just untenable, something we'd have to give.
[01:02:10.740 --> 01:02:12.700]   That's how I feel about this situation.
[01:02:12.700 --> 01:02:16.040]   Now, a lot of times in these situations,
[01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:18.960]   you have the conversation with your boss in your mind.
[01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:22.640]   And in your mind, you transform your boss
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:26.080]   into some sort of fire breathing distraction gargoyle.
[01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:27.160]   Like in your mind, you're like,
[01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:32.160]   the boss is gonna be like, "No, I always must reach you
[01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:35.620]   and then they breathe fire and they melt your computer."
[01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:37.660]   And you build it all up in your head.
[01:02:37.660 --> 01:02:40.300]   And then the reality is if you talk to your boss,
[01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:41.300]   and you do it positively, you say,
[01:02:41.300 --> 01:02:42.540]   "Hey, look, here's what deep work is.
[01:02:42.540 --> 01:02:43.940]   Here's what shallow work is.
[01:02:43.940 --> 01:02:47.100]   I have to supervise, it's very important.
[01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:48.300]   I need to be accessible.
[01:02:48.300 --> 01:02:50.100]   I also have to write briefs and prepare cases.
[01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:53.260]   And that's impossible if I get phone calls during it.
[01:02:53.260 --> 01:02:56.100]   It triples the time and the quality is lower.
[01:02:56.100 --> 01:02:58.500]   How can we figure out a way that we can do both?"
[01:02:58.500 --> 01:03:00.500]   So we can do both.
[01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:01.400]   I wanna write better cases.
[01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:02.380]   I wanna be a better supervisee.
[01:03:02.380 --> 01:03:03.820]   And it's such an easy problem to solve.
[01:03:03.820 --> 01:03:05.340]   And they'll be like, "Okay, fine."
[01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:07.140]   And this is a real solution.
[01:03:07.140 --> 01:03:09.020]   So this is something that a reader actually told me
[01:03:09.020 --> 01:03:13.020]   about an agreement he worked out with his boss.
[01:03:13.020 --> 01:03:15.240]   Two hours in the mid morning, two hours in the afternoon,
[01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:17.220]   those are closed door hours and you're preparing briefs
[01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:18.480]   and the other time you're available.
[01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:21.140]   Or they say, "We'll just tell the supervisees
[01:03:21.140 --> 01:03:24.180]   starting at noon, they can expect that you're accessible."
[01:03:24.180 --> 01:03:25.580]   Like these are like easy solutions.
[01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:26.820]   And you know what?
[01:03:26.820 --> 01:03:30.740]   9.5 times out of 10, if you come at this positively,
[01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:35.740]   not, "Hey idiot, with your stupid distraction policies,
[01:03:35.740 --> 01:03:37.700]   it's impossible to work here, stop bothering me."
[01:03:37.700 --> 01:03:38.660]   Nothing's gonna happen from that.
[01:03:38.660 --> 01:03:40.240]   But if you come at it positively,
[01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:41.660]   supervising is really important.
[01:03:41.660 --> 01:03:42.720]   I wanna do it really well.
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:44.220]   Preparing these cases is really important.
[01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:46.300]   I wanna do that really well.
[01:03:46.300 --> 01:03:48.980]   It doesn't work if the supervise hours are the full time
[01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:50.360]   because then I can't do the cases.
[01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:52.620]   So let's just figure out a way we can do both.
[01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:55.660]   And there's 9.5 times out of 10,
[01:03:55.660 --> 01:03:57.340]   bosses are like, "That makes complete sense."
[01:03:57.340 --> 01:03:58.780]   And there's like 90 reasonable solutions.
[01:03:58.780 --> 01:04:00.380]   And I have a lot of other things going on in my life.
[01:04:00.380 --> 01:04:01.980]   And this is not that important to me.
[01:04:01.980 --> 01:04:03.660]   And like, yes, you could Tuesday, Thursdays
[01:04:03.660 --> 01:04:04.780]   are not supervisor days.
[01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:07.580]   You supervise hours starts at two, whatever.
[01:04:07.580 --> 01:04:08.660]   The solution falls out.
[01:04:08.660 --> 01:04:09.740]   It takes you 15 minutes.
[01:04:09.740 --> 01:04:11.620]   Like, why did I never do this before?
[01:04:11.620 --> 01:04:13.580]   Right, so those are my two point, Walter.
[01:04:13.580 --> 01:04:16.540]   I agree, non-trivial deep work
[01:04:16.540 --> 01:04:19.180]   and nine to five open office hour policies
[01:04:19.180 --> 01:04:20.980]   do not work together.
[01:04:20.980 --> 01:04:22.820]   You're an outfielder with darked out glasses.
[01:04:22.820 --> 01:04:26.020]   But number two, if you have a reasonable positive
[01:04:26.020 --> 01:04:28.340]   conversation focused on how you can be even more effective
[01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:30.460]   for your organization, you will be surprised
[01:04:30.460 --> 01:04:31.960]   by how easy it is to fix that.
[01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:37.260]   It's true, Jesse, people get really worried about,
[01:04:37.260 --> 01:04:39.940]   when you imagine your boss in your mind,
[01:04:39.940 --> 01:04:43.660]   they become like one of history's worst monsters.
[01:04:43.660 --> 01:04:46.300]   The in your mind, you know what I mean?
[01:04:46.300 --> 01:04:51.300]   They're like, you're like, maybe I could have like an hour
[01:04:51.300 --> 01:04:52.860]   where I'm not available for email
[01:04:52.860 --> 01:04:54.060]   because I'm working on something
[01:04:54.060 --> 01:04:55.540]   and that they're gonna be like,
[01:04:55.540 --> 01:04:56.380]   (growls)
[01:04:56.380 --> 01:04:57.200]   you know what I mean?
[01:04:57.200 --> 01:04:59.420]   Like, you're fired.
[01:04:59.420 --> 01:05:02.740]   Yeah, and also we should like genocide redheads,
[01:05:02.740 --> 01:05:05.440]   you know, like their history's worst monster, you know?
[01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:09.020]   And usually they're like, yeah, whatever, I'm busy.
[01:05:09.020 --> 01:05:11.700]   Like, I have a lot of things going on.
[01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:12.740]   Yeah, it sounds good.
[01:05:12.740 --> 01:05:17.460]   I'm gonna switch gears, do something interesting.
[01:05:17.460 --> 01:05:19.820]   First, let me mention another sponsor
[01:05:19.820 --> 01:05:21.780]   that makes this show possible.
[01:05:21.780 --> 01:05:23.640]   Jesse, let me ask you a quiz.
[01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:27.460]   How many people today on my walk
[01:05:27.460 --> 01:05:30.060]   from my house in Tacoma Park to our studio here
[01:05:30.060 --> 01:05:32.340]   in Tacoma Park, how many people do you think stopped me
[01:05:32.340 --> 01:05:34.260]   to comment positively on my shave?
[01:05:34.260 --> 01:05:36.380]   Three.
[01:05:36.380 --> 01:05:38.020]   17 people.
[01:05:38.020 --> 01:05:40.780]   Three car crashes because people were like,
[01:05:40.780 --> 01:05:42.980]   oh my God, your shave and you know,
[01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:44.980]   crashed into the telephone pole.
[01:05:44.980 --> 01:05:47.300]   And you know how I got this shave?
[01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:49.860]   With my Hinson razor.
[01:05:49.860 --> 01:05:52.580]   All right, long time listeners know,
[01:05:52.580 --> 01:05:55.140]   this is a sponsor I really like because here's the story.
[01:05:55.140 --> 01:05:57.500]   It's a razor, right?
[01:05:57.500 --> 01:06:01.480]   And it's beautiful and it's metal
[01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:04.440]   and it's built with these precision CNC mills
[01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:06.560]   because this is a company that was building parts
[01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:07.620]   for the aerospace industry.
[01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:09.680]   So they have the equipment to build things super precise
[01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:11.900]   and they built this beautiful aluminum razor.
[01:06:11.900 --> 01:06:14.880]   And the way it works is you take a standard
[01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:19.260]   10 cent safety razor blade, nothing fancy,
[01:06:19.260 --> 01:06:22.360]   not one of these cartridges with 19 blades
[01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:24.460]   that vibrates and has like an artificial intelligent
[01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:28.300]   chat GPT agent that decides how to deflect each blade
[01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:31.820]   as it drives over your face like a Rover,
[01:06:31.820 --> 01:06:34.500]   just a single 10 cent standard blade
[01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:35.900]   like your grandfather would use.
[01:06:35.900 --> 01:06:38.940]   And you put it in this beautiful aluminum razor
[01:06:38.940 --> 01:06:41.940]   and because it's so precisely manufactured,
[01:06:41.940 --> 01:06:46.640]   you tighten it in there and you have just the smallest
[01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:50.140]   little bit of blade edge coming across each edge.
[01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:51.180]   And it's just a little bit,
[01:06:51.180 --> 01:06:52.460]   so you don't get the diving board effect,
[01:06:52.460 --> 01:06:54.860]   which is what causes nicks, which is what causes
[01:06:54.860 --> 01:06:59.300]   whatever you call it on your face, the cuts.
[01:06:59.300 --> 01:07:00.340]   It's nice and stable.
[01:07:00.340 --> 01:07:02.920]   And this one 10 cent blade when put into this fancy razor
[01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:04.580]   gives you a great shave.
[01:07:04.580 --> 01:07:06.940]   And so I love really well-designed products
[01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:08.780]   that look great and last forever.
[01:07:08.780 --> 01:07:10.380]   And in the long run are way cheaper to use
[01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:13.060]   than disposable cartridge based projects.
[01:07:13.060 --> 01:07:14.500]   So I love my Hanson shaver.
[01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:17.440]   I use it every day.
[01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:20.540]   And we have a good deal for you.
[01:07:20.540 --> 01:07:22.020]   But if you use my promo code
[01:07:22.020 --> 01:07:25.500]   to buy one of these beautiful razors,
[01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:28.260]   they'll give you two years worth of blades for free.
[01:07:28.260 --> 01:07:30.700]   So you won't even have to think about
[01:07:30.700 --> 01:07:35.340]   purchasing anything shaving related right for two years.
[01:07:35.340 --> 01:07:36.320]   So I think it's a pretty good deal.
[01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:37.940]   So it's time to say no to subscriptions
[01:07:37.940 --> 01:07:42.700]   and those overcomplicated, plastical, disposable razors
[01:07:42.700 --> 01:07:45.960]   and instead get one that will last you a lifetime.
[01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:49.320]   Visit hensonshaving.com/cow to pick the razor for you
[01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:50.580]   and use that code cow
[01:07:50.580 --> 01:07:53.980]   and you will get two years worth of blades for free.
[01:07:53.980 --> 01:07:57.260]   And the way that works is add the two year supply of blades
[01:07:57.260 --> 01:07:59.580]   to your cart and then use the promo code cow
[01:07:59.580 --> 01:08:02.740]   when you check out and it will reduce the price to zero.
[01:08:02.740 --> 01:08:04.880]   So that's hensonshaving.com/cow.
[01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:06.660]   That's 100 free blades when you head to
[01:08:06.660 --> 01:08:11.660]   h-e-n-s-o-n-s-h-a-v-i-n-g.com/cow
[01:08:11.660 --> 01:08:14.240]   and use that code cow.
[01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:20.680]   I always feel so sophisticated when I use my Henson razor.
[01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:22.920]   It's like metal and nice.
[01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:25.360]   And the only thing I'm missing now,
[01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:28.080]   I want one of those brushes.
[01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:29.040]   - Yeah. - You know what I mean?
[01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:31.160]   Like the depression era men would like put the,
[01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:33.520]   use it to like lather their face.
[01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:34.920]   I think I need one of those.
[01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:39.000]   I also wanna talk about one of the longest standing sponsors
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.040]   of this show and for good reason,
[01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:43.640]   and that's our good friends at Blinkist.
[01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:48.760]   Blinkist gives you 15 minute or less summaries
[01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:53.400]   of over 5,500 nonfiction books and podcasts.
[01:08:53.400 --> 01:08:57.420]   You can read these summaries or you can listen to them.
[01:08:57.420 --> 01:08:58.660]   And it is in my opinion,
[01:08:58.660 --> 01:09:00.780]   the easiest way to figure out what's going on
[01:09:00.780 --> 01:09:04.200]   with the best new nonfiction books out there.
[01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:06.000]   I'll tell you the way I use it.
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.240]   And then we can ask Jesse the way he uses it
[01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:09.320]   because I think he has a cool strategy.
[01:09:09.320 --> 01:09:11.980]   The way I use it is when I wanna figure out
[01:09:11.980 --> 01:09:14.380]   whether or not to buy a book I hear about,
[01:09:14.380 --> 01:09:15.860]   I always Blinkist it first.
[01:09:15.860 --> 01:09:18.060]   Where's the Blink, 15 minutes, I put in the audio,
[01:09:18.060 --> 01:09:20.380]   I'm doing the dishes, get the main ideas.
[01:09:20.380 --> 01:09:22.160]   And now I can make an informed decision.
[01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:24.780]   Either, ooh, I wanna buy and read this whole thing
[01:09:24.780 --> 01:09:28.000]   or I don't think I need to own this, but you know what?
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.860]   I know the main ideas and I can file that away
[01:09:30.860 --> 01:09:32.980]   and use that if I need it.
[01:09:32.980 --> 01:09:36.940]   Jesse, you use the Blinkist, you have a list, right?
[01:09:36.940 --> 01:09:38.780]   This is how you keep track of your books that you hear.
[01:09:38.780 --> 01:09:41.820]   - Yeah, 'cause you hear about book suggestions all the time
[01:09:41.820 --> 01:09:44.940]   on email lists, newspapers, magazines, stuff like that.
[01:09:44.940 --> 01:09:49.940]   So I go get that list, go to Blinkist, read up.
[01:09:49.940 --> 01:09:51.820]   And then if I wanna pursue it further,
[01:09:51.820 --> 01:09:53.660]   kinda like you, do the same, get the book.
[01:09:53.660 --> 01:09:55.820]   - So you have like a queue, you add things.
[01:09:55.820 --> 01:09:57.640]   You have kinda like a queue of books you're curious about.
[01:09:57.640 --> 01:09:58.740]   And then there's other times you're like,
[01:09:58.740 --> 01:09:59.980]   oh, I'm bored or whatever.
[01:09:59.980 --> 01:10:01.140]   Let me just start reading some Blinks
[01:10:01.140 --> 01:10:01.980]   or listening to some Blinks.
[01:10:01.980 --> 01:10:03.420]   You kinda work your way through that queue.
[01:10:03.420 --> 01:10:05.100]   - Yep. - Yeah.
[01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:05.940]   It's a great product.
[01:10:05.940 --> 01:10:09.300]   I mean, look, you gotta read, that's the source of ideas.
[01:10:09.300 --> 01:10:10.660]   How do you know what to read?
[01:10:10.660 --> 01:10:12.300]   There's only two ways to do this, two rules.
[01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:13.420]   Only two rules you need to know.
[01:10:13.420 --> 01:10:16.540]   Number one, read or listen to the Blink.
[01:10:16.540 --> 01:10:21.060]   Number two, if it's written by me, you need to read it.
[01:10:21.060 --> 01:10:23.220]   And you need to buy five copies,
[01:10:23.220 --> 01:10:24.900]   unless it's a world without email,
[01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:26.860]   in which case you need to pretend like it doesn't exist
[01:10:26.860 --> 01:10:30.020]   and then come up to me a year later and be like,
[01:10:30.020 --> 01:10:31.940]   why have you never talked about this before?
[01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:34.620]   I heard this in this interview, this is the best idea.
[01:10:34.620 --> 01:10:37.580]   I would have bought thousands of copies of a book
[01:10:37.580 --> 01:10:38.460]   that would have talked about this,
[01:10:38.460 --> 01:10:41.180]   but you have hold these ideas secret until just now,
[01:10:41.180 --> 01:10:43.540]   'cause no one knew I wrote that book.
[01:10:43.540 --> 01:10:44.820]   You could read a Blink of the book too.
[01:10:44.820 --> 01:10:46.940]   I think all my books have good Blinks on them.
[01:10:46.940 --> 01:10:50.540]   All right, so anyways, Blinkist is a no brainer for us.
[01:10:50.540 --> 01:10:52.980]   There is though a special offer.
[01:10:52.980 --> 01:10:55.940]   This is one of the things I wanted to mention.
[01:10:55.940 --> 01:10:59.340]   Actually two special offers.
[01:10:59.340 --> 01:11:03.140]   Well, Blinkist is really bringing it in the new year.
[01:11:03.140 --> 01:11:04.700]   Okay, the first thing is a new feature
[01:11:04.700 --> 01:11:07.800]   called Blinkist Connect that is going
[01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:12.800]   to allow you to share a subscription with a friend.
[01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:15.800]   You get two for the price of one.
[01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:18.180]   So I think that is quite nice.
[01:11:18.180 --> 01:11:20.580]   And they also, I think have raised their discount.
[01:11:20.580 --> 01:11:25.220]   So between now and February 28, coming up,
[01:11:25.220 --> 01:11:27.260]   Blinkist has a very special offer for our audience.
[01:11:27.260 --> 01:11:28.920]   If you go to blinkist.com/deep
[01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:31.220]   to start your seven day free trial,
[01:11:31.220 --> 01:11:35.980]   you will get 40% off a Blinkist premium membership.
[01:11:35.980 --> 01:11:37.020]   So after your free trial,
[01:11:37.020 --> 01:11:39.740]   if you decide to go ahead with your premium membership,
[01:11:39.740 --> 01:11:41.620]   if you signed up at blinkist.com/deep,
[01:11:41.620 --> 01:11:44.780]   you'll get 40% off.
[01:11:44.780 --> 01:11:47.340]   That's Blinkist spelled B-L-I-N-K-I-S-T,
[01:11:47.340 --> 01:11:51.780]   blinkist.com/deep to get 40% off and a seven day free trial.
[01:11:51.780 --> 01:11:53.140]   That's blinkist.com/deep.
[01:11:53.140 --> 01:11:56.380]   But that offer, that 40% is only good through February 28.
[01:11:56.380 --> 01:11:58.580]   So time is running short.
[01:11:58.580 --> 01:11:59.860]   And as mentioned for a limited time,
[01:11:59.860 --> 01:12:03.120]   they also have this Blinkist Connect feature,
[01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:05.060]   which will allow you to share your premium account
[01:12:05.060 --> 01:12:05.880]   with a friend.
[01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:07.740]   You'll get two premium subscriptions
[01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:09.900]   for the price of one.
[01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:11.100]   All right.
[01:12:11.100 --> 01:12:12.660]   Blinkist is bringing it, Jesse.
[01:12:12.660 --> 01:12:13.500]   - It's bringing it.
[01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:14.320]   - It's the time to do it, man.
[01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:15.980]   New Year's, everyone wants to start reading more.
[01:12:15.980 --> 01:12:16.820]   - Yeah.
[01:12:16.820 --> 01:12:18.740]   - And Blinkist, like it makes you a better reader.
[01:12:18.740 --> 01:12:20.100]   So I'm a big fan of that.
[01:12:20.100 --> 01:12:22.020]   All right, to end the show for our final segment,
[01:12:22.020 --> 01:12:23.620]   I always like to change gears
[01:12:23.620 --> 01:12:26.280]   and we're gonna do something interesting.
[01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:28.700]   And what I mean by that is I like to pull something
[01:12:28.700 --> 01:12:32.160]   that someone sent me to interesting@calnewport.com.
[01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:34.480]   This is my catch all address where my readers
[01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:37.480]   and listeners have long sent me things they think
[01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:39.240]   I'll find to be interesting.
[01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:41.580]   And I do like to share examples from that.
[01:12:41.580 --> 01:12:45.220]   So I have a particular example I wanna share today.
[01:12:45.220 --> 01:12:47.620]   It is an article that a reader sent to me.
[01:12:47.620 --> 01:12:51.040]   If you're watching at youtube.com/calnewportmedia,
[01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:54.540]   you'll see this on the screen, but I'll also read it.
[01:12:54.540 --> 01:12:57.620]   The article is titled "Aboard the African Star"
[01:12:57.620 --> 01:13:00.840]   by Alex Haley, the novelist Alex Haley,
[01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:02.540]   who wrote among other things,
[01:13:02.540 --> 01:13:05.860]   "Roots," the book "Roots."
[01:13:05.860 --> 01:13:07.580]   The log line here is July, 2020.
[01:13:07.580 --> 01:13:08.900]   That's just when this was reposted.
[01:13:08.900 --> 01:13:10.700]   I'm gonna scroll to the bottom here.
[01:13:10.700 --> 01:13:14.140]   This has the actual attribution.
[01:13:14.140 --> 01:13:18.320]   So this was edited from a talk and it came out
[01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:20.380]   in Reader's Digest in 1991,
[01:13:20.380 --> 01:13:21.900]   four months before Alex Haley's death.
[01:13:21.900 --> 01:13:24.460]   So this Alex Haley wrote this in the early nineties
[01:13:24.460 --> 01:13:27.140]   before he died.
[01:13:27.140 --> 01:13:29.380]   Anyways, here's what was interesting about this.
[01:13:30.900 --> 01:13:35.900]   Haley has a interesting habit to find deep work settings,
[01:13:35.900 --> 01:13:39.100]   settings conducive to deep work
[01:13:39.100 --> 01:13:41.320]   when he wants to work on one of his novels.
[01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:43.680]   I'm just gonna read this to you from the article.
[01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:46.620]   I love how casually, by the way, he is about this.
[01:13:46.620 --> 01:13:50.020]   Usually I go out on freight ships, cargo ships.
[01:13:50.020 --> 01:13:51.540]   I wanna get caught on a liner.
[01:13:51.540 --> 01:13:53.900]   How can you write with 800 people dancing?
[01:13:53.900 --> 01:13:55.980]   But freight ships carry a maximum of 12 people
[01:13:55.980 --> 01:13:57.800]   and they tend to be very quiet people.
[01:13:57.800 --> 01:14:00.540]   I work my principal hours from about 1030 at night
[01:14:00.540 --> 01:14:02.020]   until daybreak.
[01:14:02.020 --> 01:14:03.540]   The world is yours at that point.
[01:14:03.540 --> 01:14:07.060]   Most all the passengers are asleep.
[01:14:07.060 --> 01:14:13.020]   So Alex Haley, to find a space conducive to deep work,
[01:14:13.020 --> 01:14:16.180]   looked around his options.
[01:14:16.180 --> 01:14:19.540]   He said, okay, I could build a special deep work office
[01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:21.860]   in my backyard, maybe convert a shed like David McCullough,
[01:14:21.860 --> 01:14:23.220]   not deep enough.
[01:14:23.220 --> 01:14:25.540]   Or I could go rent an office somewhere
[01:14:25.540 --> 01:14:29.660]   like Peter Benchley did at the Furnace Factory
[01:14:29.660 --> 01:14:31.380]   in Pennington, New Jersey to get away from my house.
[01:14:31.380 --> 01:14:33.100]   And that's where I'm gonna go to write, not deep enough.
[01:14:33.100 --> 01:14:35.780]   He could go rent hotel rooms
[01:14:35.780 --> 01:14:37.340]   and take all the paintings off the wall.
[01:14:37.340 --> 01:14:39.660]   So it's just a white box.
[01:14:39.660 --> 01:14:42.380]   So he can write without distraction like Maya Angelou did,
[01:14:42.380 --> 01:14:43.740]   but he said not deep enough.
[01:14:43.740 --> 01:14:47.540]   He could go out on a fishing boat like John Steinbeck
[01:14:47.540 --> 01:14:49.660]   and balance a notepad on his knees
[01:14:49.660 --> 01:14:50.620]   out in a Harbor to write.
[01:14:50.620 --> 01:14:53.380]   And Haley said, not deep enough.
[01:14:53.380 --> 01:14:55.220]   He said, this is what I'm gonna do.
[01:14:55.220 --> 01:14:59.300]   I'm going to become a passenger on a cargo freight liner,
[01:14:59.300 --> 01:15:00.580]   crossing the ocean.
[01:15:00.580 --> 01:15:02.540]   And not only am I going to sequester myself
[01:15:02.540 --> 01:15:03.900]   on a cargo freight liner,
[01:15:03.900 --> 01:15:05.740]   I'm gonna wait till the nighttime
[01:15:05.740 --> 01:15:08.740]   when the 12 people on this massive boat are asleep.
[01:15:08.740 --> 01:15:11.020]   And at the nighttime on a cargo freight liner
[01:15:11.020 --> 01:15:12.340]   in the middle of the ocean,
[01:15:12.340 --> 01:15:14.100]   that's where I get my writing done.
[01:15:14.100 --> 01:15:18.580]   So I think we just got to clap at some point
[01:15:18.580 --> 01:15:22.020]   or someone who really pushed deep work forward.
[01:15:22.020 --> 01:15:25.060]   The funny thing is where this reference came from.
[01:15:25.060 --> 01:15:28.140]   It's actually John McPhee wrote a book about the ships
[01:15:28.140 --> 01:15:31.020]   where John McPhee actually traveled
[01:15:31.020 --> 01:15:32.940]   on some of these cargo freight liners
[01:15:32.940 --> 01:15:34.540]   and wrote a book about it.
[01:15:34.540 --> 01:15:37.420]   And he just mentions very casually,
[01:15:37.420 --> 01:15:41.580]   oh, by the way, Alex Haley liked to write on these boats.
[01:15:41.580 --> 01:15:42.900]   And that's what sent me down the rabbit hole.
[01:15:42.900 --> 01:15:43.740]   Like, really?
[01:15:43.740 --> 01:15:44.580]   That's a big claim.
[01:15:44.580 --> 01:15:45.580]   And he was right.
[01:15:45.580 --> 01:15:49.980]   He writes at night on a cargo freight liner.
[01:15:49.980 --> 01:15:51.740]   So there we go.
[01:15:51.740 --> 01:15:53.980]   Jesse, we're gonna get the typical complaint email here.
[01:15:53.980 --> 01:15:55.380]   I can just read it now.
[01:15:55.380 --> 01:15:56.340]   That's good for him.
[01:15:56.340 --> 01:15:58.580]   But how am I gonna write in the middle of the night,
[01:15:58.580 --> 01:16:00.980]   in the middle of the ocean on a cargo freight liner
[01:16:00.980 --> 01:16:02.620]   when I have kids?
[01:16:02.620 --> 01:16:05.300]   We're definitely gonna get that email.
[01:16:05.300 --> 01:16:10.500]   My response is screw them, get on the freight liner.
[01:16:10.500 --> 01:16:11.340]   There it is.
[01:16:11.340 --> 01:16:12.180]   I think that's cool.
[01:16:12.180 --> 01:16:14.620]   So as I like to do sometimes in these interesting segments
[01:16:14.620 --> 01:16:16.980]   is when people go over the top with depth,
[01:16:16.980 --> 01:16:18.700]   I just find it fun.
[01:16:18.700 --> 01:16:19.940]   We can't do it,
[01:16:19.940 --> 01:16:22.980]   but it's aspirational to see what they're doing.
[01:16:22.980 --> 01:16:25.340]   I feel like I would get stir crazy.
[01:16:25.340 --> 01:16:26.180]   I don't know.
[01:16:26.180 --> 01:16:27.100]   I'm worried.
[01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:28.900]   Like, what if you were really bored?
[01:16:28.900 --> 01:16:30.300]   Put a row right there, man.
[01:16:30.300 --> 01:16:33.260]   Pull behind it, row behind it.
[01:16:33.260 --> 01:16:34.100]   Get on the ocean.
[01:16:34.100 --> 01:16:35.460]   You could just row and then write.
[01:16:35.460 --> 01:16:37.300]   You could probably get in beastly shape.
[01:16:37.300 --> 01:16:39.100]   That'd be interesting if you're like stuck on your,
[01:16:39.100 --> 01:16:41.300]   I'm one of 12 passengers on a cargo liner,
[01:16:41.300 --> 01:16:42.620]   like going around the Horn of Africa
[01:16:42.620 --> 01:16:43.940]   or something like that.
[01:16:43.940 --> 01:16:44.780]   Yeah.
[01:16:44.780 --> 01:16:48.380]   I'm just gonna bring on like weights and a laptop.
[01:16:48.380 --> 01:16:49.220]   And healthy foods.
[01:16:49.220 --> 01:16:50.260]   And healthy foods.
[01:16:50.260 --> 01:16:51.780]   Yeah.
[01:16:51.780 --> 01:16:53.420]   I think we could sell that.
[01:16:53.460 --> 01:16:57.540]   If we called it like the deep work transit lines
[01:16:57.540 --> 01:16:59.780]   and like got some really cool advertising materials
[01:16:59.780 --> 01:17:00.660]   and people like, this is great.
[01:17:00.660 --> 01:17:02.380]   I'm gonna be in the secluded or whatever.
[01:17:02.380 --> 01:17:04.500]   And they have to show up at like the Port of Baltimore.
[01:17:04.500 --> 01:17:06.420]   And it's just this like terrible rusty.
[01:17:06.420 --> 01:17:07.340]   Give him a t-shirt.
[01:17:07.340 --> 01:17:08.180]   Give him a t-shirt.
[01:17:08.180 --> 01:17:09.020]   Like, here you go.
[01:17:09.020 --> 01:17:10.940]   Thanks for your $12,000.
[01:17:10.940 --> 01:17:12.260]   But anyways, Alex Haley,
[01:17:12.260 --> 01:17:16.220]   we tip our hats to you.
[01:17:16.220 --> 01:17:17.420]   I actually just watched,
[01:17:17.420 --> 01:17:19.420]   I watched a lot of movies.
[01:17:19.420 --> 01:17:21.220]   I re-watched Captain Phillips.
[01:17:21.220 --> 01:17:22.060]   Oh, that's good.
[01:17:22.060 --> 01:17:22.900]   This week.
[01:17:22.900 --> 01:17:26.140]   It doesn't make you like really eager
[01:17:26.140 --> 01:17:28.420]   to follow Alex Haley's model though.
[01:17:28.420 --> 01:17:31.980]   So a movie about pirates taking over a cargo liner
[01:17:31.980 --> 01:17:35.700]   does not make you want to just casually go out
[01:17:35.700 --> 01:17:37.660]   on a cargo liner.
[01:17:37.660 --> 01:17:38.500]   That was a good movie though.
[01:17:38.500 --> 01:17:39.660]   Yeah.
[01:17:39.660 --> 01:17:42.180]   I went down a rabbit hole and listened to an interview
[01:17:42.180 --> 01:17:45.100]   with one of the members of SEAL Team Six
[01:17:45.100 --> 01:17:47.780]   that was deployed onto the Bain Bridge,
[01:17:47.780 --> 01:17:49.380]   the rescue Captain Phillips.
[01:17:49.380 --> 01:17:50.500]   So it's interesting to hear about it
[01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:51.380]   from their point of view.
[01:17:51.380 --> 01:17:54.460]   Actually, the movie got it pretty right,
[01:17:54.460 --> 01:17:56.860]   except for they left out how gross it actually was
[01:17:56.860 --> 01:17:58.700]   inside that lifeboat, which.
[01:17:58.700 --> 01:17:59.780]   Oh, really?
[01:17:59.780 --> 01:18:02.100]   There's a detail I didn't need to know,
[01:18:02.100 --> 01:18:03.380]   but the SEAL Team Six member was like,
[01:18:03.380 --> 01:18:05.980]   you have to recognize that for three days,
[01:18:05.980 --> 01:18:07.900]   that lifeboat had been used as a toilet.
[01:18:07.900 --> 01:18:08.740]   Yeah.
[01:18:08.740 --> 01:18:10.100]   And in the African sun.
[01:18:10.100 --> 01:18:12.980]   So there you go.
[01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:15.900]   Very important information for our listeners out there.
[01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:18.060]   I don't know what got me thinking about it, but whatever.
[01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:19.260]   Anyways, I love interesting stuff.
[01:18:19.260 --> 01:18:20.460]   Interesting@calnewport.com.
[01:18:20.460 --> 01:18:23.100]   If you want to send me things you think I would like.
[01:18:23.100 --> 01:18:24.780]   All right, that's all the time we have for today.
[01:18:24.780 --> 01:18:26.460]   Thank you for listening.
[01:18:26.460 --> 01:18:28.180]   You could watch the episode or clips
[01:18:28.180 --> 01:18:30.140]   at youtube.com/calnewportmedia.
[01:18:30.140 --> 01:18:31.140]   To submit your own questions,

[01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:35.820]   We'll be back next week as normal.
[01:18:35.820 --> 01:18:38.260]   And until then, as always, stay deep.
[01:18:38.260 --> 01:18:40.860]   (upbeat music)
[01:18:40.860 --> 01:18:43.460]   (upbeat music)
[01:18:43.460 --> 01:18:46.060]   (upbeat music)
[01:18:46.060 --> 01:18:48.640]   (upbeat music)
[01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:50.380]   (upbeat music)
