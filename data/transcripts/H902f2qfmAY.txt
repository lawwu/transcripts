[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360]   there will be like a finite amount of total matter that will ever exist in our light cone,
[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:10.160]   right? And that means that there's a limit on the amount of computation that this matter can,
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.080]   you know, execute, the amount of energy it can provide, perhaps even the amount of economic
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.880]   value it can sustain, right? So does this impose some sort of limit on your concept of the beginning
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:25.440]   of infinity? - Theories of cosmology are changing on a time scale of about a decade. So it doesn't
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:32.000]   make all that much sense to speculate about what the ultimate asymptotic form of the cosmological
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.760]   theories will be. If there's a finite amount of GNP available in the distant future, then it's
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:49.760]   still up to us whether we spend that on mathematics or music or political systems or any of the
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.760]   thousands of even more worthwhile things that have yet to be invented. My guess is that there are no
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.760]   such limits.
