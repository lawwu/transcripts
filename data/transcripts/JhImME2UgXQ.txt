[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.760]   When I first started working in machine learning, you could be successful by just building and
[00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:08.560]   optimizing models. There wasn't much pressure to show how these models led to real-world value.
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:14.000]   But that's changed. Now data scientists and ML engineers need to show how their work leads to
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.720]   concretely better outcomes for their business. If you haven't done this, it can be tricky.
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.000]   The problem is that ML models make predictions, but predictions alone don't tell you what to do.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.200]   Just as an example, some people use ML for demand forecasting. But you typically wouldn't
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.360]   stock exactly the amount that the model predicts you can sell. Model predictions aren't perfect.
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.600]   So if a model predicted you were going to sell 1000 mangoes before the next shipment comes,
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.480]   and you plan to have exactly that amount of stock, there's roughly a 50% chance that real
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.280]   demand would be more than that prediction, and that you'd run out. So people carry extra
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.240]   inventory. But how do you go from a prediction like predicted demand to an amount that you choose
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:57.760]   to have in stock? That is an example of decision optimization. And decision optimization is an
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.960]   important step almost everywhere that machine learning is used. In this course, you'll learn
[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:09.040]   techniques to rigorously optimize decisions based on your ML models. You'll learn simple techniques
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.000]   like profit curves and sophisticated techniques like optimizing within a dynamic simulation.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.680]   I really like decision optimization because it's cross disciplinary. It integrates machine learning
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.760]   with ideas from economics, statistics, operations research, computer science, and a lot more.
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.280]   Bringing these pieces together make your ML skills more practically useful. And it helps you
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.240]   concretely measure the value that you create for your business. I built a company making decision
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.520]   optimization tools for data scientists. And while doing that, I talked with data science leaders at
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.960]   a lot of companies, they repeatedly told me that translating ML into better decisions and improving
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:51.280]   the dollar value from those decisions is their top priority as leaders and managers. So I'm excited to
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.480]   share this course with you. Sign up and let's maximize the real world value of your machine
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:05.360]   learning skills.
