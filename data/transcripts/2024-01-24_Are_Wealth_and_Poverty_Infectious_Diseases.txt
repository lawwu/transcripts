[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.920]   in 10 years or less.
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:41.760]   My name is Josh Rasheeds.
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.600]   I'm your host.
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.560]   Today, I want to give you one simple encouragement,
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.840]   and that is this.
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.680]   Surround yourself with the things
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.800]   that you want more of in your life.
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.480]   Surround yourself intentionally
[00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.840]   with the things that you want more of in your life.
[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.480]   Or said differently,
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.880]   intentionally surround yourself
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.760]   with more of the things that you want in your life.
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.960]   I'm not sure how else to say it,
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.480]   but I want to expand it for you
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:17.800]   and give you some ideas.
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.360]   But first, a simple story.
[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.240]   I'm broadcasting to you today from Panama City, Panama.
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.520]   I'm here with Gabriel Custodiate
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.160]   and Mikel Thorup and a bunch of my listeners,
[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.560]   and we're doing our Panama Investment Tour.
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.920]   And yesterday, we spent a good amount of the day
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.760]   touring real estate.
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.600]   We had some morning sessions, some educational sessions,
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.600]   and then we went to kind of a mid-upscale luxury tower
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.120]   that was newly built
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.600]   and checked out some of the things there.
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.120]   Then we went and visited kind of a mid-rise building
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.200]   that was going to be primarily designated
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.800]   for kind of young people housing, student housing,
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.200]   things like that, kind of entry-level stuff.
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.280]   And then we finished our evening
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.600]   at a very private, exclusive community
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.720]   that is being developed just off the coast of Panama.
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.360]   It's got a very interesting story.
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.600]   It's a set of man-made islands.
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.560]   It's called Ocean Reef Islands.
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.440]   And evidently, it's an interesting story
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.920]   because they are created islands,
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.760]   kind of like I think most people would know
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.640]   about the palms in Dubai,
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.320]   some of the man-made island developments
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.240]   that have been built in Dubai.
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.600]   Well, these are kind of like that,
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.760]   but it's a rather exclusive opportunity
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.600]   because no one can build islands like these anymore.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.640]   The way that these islands came about
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.640]   is that a contractor built a highway through Panama City
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.480]   for the Panamanians.
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.400]   And as I understand the story,
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.480]   the Panamanian government didn't have all of the money
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.320]   that they had pledged to pay the contractor.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.760]   And so they paid part of it with money,
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.920]   and they paid the other part of the bill
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.280]   with rights, with property rights.
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.520]   And so they granted a small selection of property rights,
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.240]   of basically development rights to the sea
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.360]   right off the coast of Panama City,
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.280]   right in front of the city.
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.080]   Well, that contractor later sold it to a developer
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.840]   who we met last night.
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.160]   And this developer has built these two man-made islands
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.800]   and they are developing the real estate on it.
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.480]   But these islands are very exclusive
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.320]   because some time back,
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.680]   the Panamanian court found it unconstitutional
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.840]   to do things like build man-made islands in the sea
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.800]   because the sea is part of the patrimony of all people.
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:42.840]   It's the heritage,
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.880]   it's the collective heritage of all the people.
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.960]   And so it would be unjust and unconstitutional
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.680]   to give it away to individuals to develop it.
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.760]   So in essence, this development is one of a kind,
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.680]   and as such, it's quite an exclusive development,
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.760]   have lots of beautiful houses there, et cetera.
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.200]   But as I was there last night,
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.440]   touring some of the apartments that are there for sale
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.880]   and some of the houses and thinking about it,
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.440]   I was quite shocked at how inspired I was
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.440]   simply by being there on the island,
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.200]   being there in the beautiful condo,
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.920]   being there in the beautiful apartment,
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.600]   being in the beautiful houses.
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.240]   And as we finished the evening,
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.360]   having dinner on the terrace overlooking the marina,
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.640]   and just surrounded by beauty and wealth,
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.280]   and there's the gorgeous skyline
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.760]   of Panama City at the distance,
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.200]   and the evening turns cool when the sun goes down.
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.960]   It's just a very inspiring experience.
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.600]   And I realized that this is something
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.560]   that I myself have neglected significantly
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.040]   over the last couple of years.
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.920]   I didn't always neglect it.
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.000]   I used to give great attention to this.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.160]   So for example, practical application.
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.520]   I enjoy being surrounded by wealth,
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.800]   being surrounded by luxury, et cetera.
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.000]   And so one of the things that I have frequently
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.360]   had a habit of doing for many, many years
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.560]   is always to go and quarterly do something
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.600]   like take myself to a nice lunch
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.440]   at a nice five-star hotel often,
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:13.920]   and sit out on the balcony
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.200]   and think about my plans for the quarter,
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.720]   and build my goals and build my dreams.
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.280]   Et cetera.
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.120]   Things like that.
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.000]   I've been very fortunate to grow up in an environment
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.960]   in which I've had lots of wealthy friends
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.400]   and wealthy people around me,
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.080]   and I've lived just a privileged existence.
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.120]   I've done some of the coolest things,
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.600]   been around money, been with very wealthy people, et cetera.
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.880]   And so that was just part of my life
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.280]   in some ways automatically,
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:46.080]   even though the money wasn't mine, it was just around me.
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.760]   And I realized last night that this is something
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.520]   that I have unconsciously neglected for the last few years.
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.560]   I have not been doing this.
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.640]   And it's understandable why I haven't been doing this.
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:59.520]   It's understandable.
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.720]   I've been having babies and staying close to home
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.080]   and working and homeschooling, et cetera.
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.840]   But I realized, Joshua, what are you doing?
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.240]   You've neglected the basics.
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.680]   You've neglected to give yourself inspiration.
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.320]   You've neglected to give yourself a vision.
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.440]   You got your head down, you're working, working, working,
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.360]   but you don't know what you're working towards.
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.880]   And if you'd asked me that the day before yesterday,
[00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.240]   I would have said, well, maybe,
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.520]   but I wouldn't have realized it.
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.320]   But having that emotional experience made me realize it.
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.200]   And as I was reflecting on it throughout the day-to-day
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.840]   and last evening, I realized that this is something,
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.840]   again, that I've neglected, that I need to change.
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.200]   I need to pick up my old habits,
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.840]   and more importantly than picking them up,
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.840]   I need to reinforce them.
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.680]   And this is something that I thought
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:46.800]   would be helpful for you,
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.800]   'cause perhaps you yourself have neglected
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.000]   to surround yourself with more of the things
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   that you want in life.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.200]   Now, money, wealth, luxury,
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.680]   certainly those things are inspirational.
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.000]   I think we should pay attention to this
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.960]   because we can measure these things.
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.120]   I wonder if there's an academic out there
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:12.240]   who has tried to figure out
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:16.400]   how much of the growth of wealth,
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.680]   how much of the fact that the rich get richer
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.400]   and the poor get poorer,
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.840]   how much of that could be attributed to environment?
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.840]   I've never read any research on that,
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:29.240]   but I'd be fascinated to know if anyone has tried to do that
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.600]   because although there's clearly
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:35.600]   a behavioral function of this,
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.280]   meaning that wealthy people become wealthy
[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:41.680]   because they do the kinds of things that wealthy people do,
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.800]   the precursor to behavior is influence.
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.840]   It's environment.
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.680]   And I was considering, I did see recently
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.720]   something of a write-up or a paper or something
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:54.840]   where an academic or some kind of analyst
[00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:59.760]   had proposed and said that obesity should be treated
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:04.000]   exactly in the same way that a contagious disease
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.240]   is treated, as an epidemic,
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:10.040]   because obesity truly is contagious.
[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:12.160]   And I didn't immerse myself in the details
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.440]   enough to articulate it to you,
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:18.160]   but the basic argument was that if you track obesity,
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.880]   fat people, if you track fatness,
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:25.080]   it's connected, it's correlated, it's connected,
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:27.680]   and it's, and this person was making the argument,
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.000]   that it's causally connected.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:29.880]   It's not correlated.
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:32.600]   It's causally connected to being surrounded
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:36.320]   by other fat people, and I realized, isn't that true?
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:40.000]   I know for me, if I'm hanging out with my fat friends
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.560]   and we go out to dinner, then it's very easy
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:47.480]   and easy for me to order fattening, unhealthy foods,
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:50.440]   because that's normal, whereas if I go out
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.400]   with a bunch of health-conscious people
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:56.360]   who are very thin and athletic, et cetera,
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:59.400]   I don't wanna be the guy that's ordering fat person food.
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.440]   That's just, how come I'm not gonna do it?
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:04.840]   And so that influence spreads itself,
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:06.800]   and you see that in terms of exercise.
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:09.960]   Healthy, athletic people are more likely
[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:12.480]   to suggest healthy ways of passing time together.
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.360]   They're not gonna say, let's come over and,
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:16.280]   I don't know, binge watch TV and pizza.
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:17.720]   They'll say, let's go for a walk.
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:18.760]   Let's go play a game.
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:19.840]   Let's go to the park.
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:20.960]   Let's go skiing.
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:21.880]   Let's go hiking.
[00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:23.480]   Let's go do something athletic,
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:26.960]   and what's interesting to me is I realized
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:31.000]   that that research-based statistical analysis
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.960]   is something that we should apply to other areas of life,
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:37.120]   and I could imagine this being true.
[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:40.200]   I could imagine a researcher 10 or 20 years from now,
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.920]   if it hasn't been done already, and I'm just ignorant of it,
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:47.920]   showing how so many of the individual decisions
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:51.480]   that cause somebody to be wealthy
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:56.480]   are based on an infectious form of behavior.
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:59.640]   You see one of your friends buying a house
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:02.360]   instead of renting, and you say, well, why couldn't I?
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:03.320]   Why not me?
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:05.560]   And you go and buy a house instead of renting,
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:07.280]   and that single decision alone accounts
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:10.840]   for an enormous amount of the growth of wealth
[00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:13.840]   that other people do, that people experience.
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.800]   You see one of your friends going and getting a better job,
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:18.320]   and sometimes your friend will say to you,
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:19.720]   well, why don't you go get a better job,
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:20.920]   and you never thought about it before.
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:23.280]   You realize, why don't I go get a better job?
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:24.760]   One of your friends starts a business
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:26.720]   or someone you know starts a business,
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:29.720]   and you recognize, hey, I could do that, too,
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:31.640]   and sometimes a business wins.
[00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:33.800]   And people who grow up in that environment,
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.600]   who grow up surrounded by success,
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.880]   who grow up surrounded by people
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:39.440]   who make those kinds of decisions,
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:43.000]   they naturally think that it's normal to do that,
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.760]   and that expression of normality is so powerful.
[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:49.840]   I wish that I had lots of other examples to point to,
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:51.720]   but the one that just is so striking to me
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.240]   is the one that I have said about fat people
[00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.720]   versus non-fat people and unhealthy people
[00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:58.160]   versus healthy people.
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.240]   I think you see this if you listen to people
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:04.480]   who are from a place that is very image-conscious,
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:08.240]   maybe Miami, Florida, or Los Angeles, California,
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:10.640]   or something like that, and what you find
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:12.760]   when you hang out with people from those areas
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:14.920]   is they're very, very conscious
[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:17.760]   of everything related to image,
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:19.680]   and so they're very health-conscious,
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:21.760]   they're very focused on how they eat,
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:25.040]   they're very prone to athletic endeavors,
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:27.920]   and the lifestyle around them grows up
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:30.920]   because of their interest in those things,
[00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:34.560]   and there are more healthy options available.
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:35.720]   And you look around at the people,
[00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:37.760]   and you see fat people, you see unhealthy people,
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:40.600]   but on the whole, the people have beautiful bodies,
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:43.520]   they have beautiful skin, they dress beautifully, et cetera,
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:46.640]   this external expressions that we have of health,
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:49.040]   and it seems like it's contagious.
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:50.640]   Then if you go somewhere else,
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.600]   I've watched several YouTube videos
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:55.280]   where people will travel to the fattest city in America,
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:59.440]   and genuinely, just good-hearted, genuinely caring people,
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.800]   they go to the fattest city in America,
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.120]   and they talk to people.
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:04.920]   And even some of the residents of that city
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:08.600]   talk about how hard it is for them
[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.240]   to be in that environment,
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:16.720]   and to not be unhealthy, not be fat,
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:19.640]   and it's very much an environmental thing.
[00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:22.280]   And you can see this, right?
[00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:26.760]   You may have somebody that comes from one of those places
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:29.240]   and moves to, again, beautiful city,
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:31.600]   beautiful people city, wherever that happens to be,
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.600]   and pretty soon, they're dressing differently,
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.240]   their habits start to rub off on them, et cetera.
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:39.480]   So this is something, again, I wish I had a better,
[00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.040]   multiple examples to give,
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:43.040]   but I think this connects enough.
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:45.160]   I think most people would acknowledge
[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.360]   that what I'm saying has truth.
[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:51.200]   And you can see that causal connection
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:54.520]   that the researcher was recently referring to.
[00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:56.800]   And this turning to money and business,
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:00.240]   this is one of the reasons why the big mega cities
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:02.440]   are likely to only get bigger,
[00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:04.800]   because when somebody goes into that environment,
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.600]   so when somebody goes to New York City
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:07.720]   and lives in New York City,
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:10.240]   and they start to be surrounded by the hustle,
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:11.840]   and the bustle, and the opportunity,
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:14.400]   and the enthusiasm that pervades
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:17.000]   and permeates the city like that,
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.360]   it's hard not to be affected by it.
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:22.200]   It's hard not to be infected by it.
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:23.480]   It affects you.
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:26.000]   I notice this every time I spend time in the United States
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.080]   is that when I'm in the United States,
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:33.120]   the culture of achievement, the culture of hard work,
[00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:36.280]   the work ethic, et cetera, starts to rub off on me.
[00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:39.720]   I start to feel more and more competitive,
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:42.760]   and I wanna strive, I wanna compete, et cetera.
[00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:45.840]   But when I go to a place that has a slower pace of life
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:48.720]   and has a more laid back culture, et cetera,
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:51.040]   I just, eh, there's no need to do it,
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:53.240]   and I start to just be more content
[00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:55.280]   and more complacent, et cetera.
[00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:58.320]   Now, it's certainly advisable
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:13:59.880]   to take a good, hard, honest look
[00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:01.840]   at what you want more of in your life.
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:04.320]   And if you don't want more money in your life,
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:05.840]   but you want more relaxation,
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:07.960]   then perhaps you should relocate
[00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:10.400]   to a place where that is the key.
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:13.680]   But the point I wanna drive home today
[00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:18.040]   in a very simple way is you can make conscious decisions
[00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:23.000]   to surround yourself with more of what you want in life.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   And you can do that in a variety of ways.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.760]   A very actionable way that you can do that
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:32.640]   is by surrounding yourself virtually
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:36.660]   with what you want more of in your life.
[00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:39.800]   Remember that every influence that you invite
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:43.720]   into your life is going to influence you.
[00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:48.040]   And so all of us need to do a careful audit
[00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:50.760]   of the types of things that we allow
[00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:55.200]   into our homes, into our eyeballs,
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:59.720]   into our ear balls, and into our minds.
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:04.040]   We need to be very careful of the things that we allow in.
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:07.840]   And unfortunately, there's such a tendency
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:10.960]   that we all have to be rather aimless
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:14.920]   about what we consume, because it just sneaks its way in.
[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:16.800]   And usually it's an algorithm
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:19.440]   just kind of serving things up to us.
[00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:22.860]   And so as I realized this truth last night,
[00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:25.720]   I said, I need to take another good hard look
[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:27.520]   at my algorithms.
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:30.560]   Are they serving me with what I want?
[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:34.200]   Or have they been trained to give me what I don't want?
[00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:38.040]   I want to be surrounded by the virtue,
[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:43.040]   the righteousness, the success,
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:46.720]   the freedom, the wealth, the good living.
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:49.200]   I want to be surrounded by the good, the beautiful,
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:52.000]   the positive, et cetera, in my life.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.880]   I don't want to be surrounded by negativity
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:58.920]   and sarcasm and cynicism and poor little old me-ism
[00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:01.120]   and I can't do it and the world is falling.
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:03.360]   I don't want to be surrounded with that stuff.
[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:05.080]   I'm gonna, I don't want it.
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:08.480]   And so I'm going to very intentionally take a look
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:10.440]   at all of my virtual environments
[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:14.520]   and consider what can I prune, what do I want more of?
[00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:17.440]   Am I surrounding myself with the things that I want?
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:21.000]   Now we can extend virtuality or virtual environment
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.240]   to things that aren't digital technology.
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:26.760]   And I've always loved magazines for this reason.
[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:31.760]   Traveling the world, my magazine consumption is much less,
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:35.200]   but I really love magazines for this reason.
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:39.400]   And I think even in 2024, there's still something special
[00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:42.440]   about having some magazines that flow into your life
[00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:45.520]   on a monthly basis that remind you of what you want.
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:48.960]   For example, this is goofy and I don't, kind of personal,
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:51.200]   but there's a magazine, I think they're still published,
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:53.920]   I subscribe to for years, called Coastal Living.
[00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:57.360]   And it was just this wonderful, simple magazine
[00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:00.760]   about seaside homes and the feelings that came with them.
[00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:03.040]   And I always loved that magazine 'cause it inspired me
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:05.440]   and it's the kind of aesthetic that I like
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:07.960]   and that I enjoy being around, et cetera.
[00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.120]   So think about what kinds of magazines
[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:12.000]   could you surround yourself with?
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.960]   It's inspiring to have a magazine
[00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:17.120]   that feeds you fresh new images for yourself.
[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:18.960]   And I haven't done this in years.
[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:20.400]   I regret not doing it more,
[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:22.960]   but for years I used to keep a lookbook,
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:26.000]   a physical lookbook, and I would take the magazines
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.280]   and I would cut out anything that I found inspirational
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:31.760]   from those magazines and I would paste, literally,
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:34.760]   the pictures into a notebook.
[00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:36.360]   I would just get cheap composition books.
[00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:38.360]   And I used to love going through those notebooks
[00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:41.520]   because they filled my mind with images that I wanted,
[00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:44.520]   that I wanted to see more of, and they were inspirational.
[00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:46.200]   And I would think, what can I do
[00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:48.900]   to have more of this in my life?
[00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:51.960]   You can make your images in any way that you want
[00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:54.120]   and you can make any kind of associations
[00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:55.640]   with anything that you want.
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:57.680]   So you make your own associations
[00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:59.200]   and don't be bashful about the things
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:00.560]   that you want in your life.
[00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:04.280]   One other application of that,
[00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:07.880]   today I do this more with digital tools.
[00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:09.380]   I don't think they're as effective,
[00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:12.480]   but I keep a folder full of images that inspire me.
[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:15.720]   Whenever I see something online that inspires me
[00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.640]   in whatever way, I screenshot it
[00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:19.960]   and I add it to my inspiration folder.
[00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:22.380]   And so it's kind of like a digital lookbook.
[00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:27.380]   Recently I've been creating images for my children.
[00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:29.660]   And what I'll do is I'll take a virtue.
[00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:32.980]   We practice a lot of virtue in character study.
[00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:36.140]   And so I have gotten pretty good
[00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:40.180]   with using Dolly through Chat GPT.
[00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:42.020]   I've gotten pretty good at training Dolly
[00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:43.980]   to give me the kinds of things that I want.
[00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:48.060]   So what I do for my children is I take a picture of,
[00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:53.060]   I create an image using the AI art generation system,
[00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:54.420]   and I age them a little bit.
[00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:57.660]   So I show them, say, seven, eight, 10 years down the road.
[00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:02.420]   And then I use that avatar that I've created
[00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:05.660]   that looks sort of like what they might look like
[00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:07.300]   in seven, eight, 10 years.
[00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:09.980]   And then I put that avatar in a situation
[00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:14.140]   where, say, the person is demonstrating determination
[00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:16.780]   or courage or honesty or empathy
[00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:19.060]   or whatever the character quality is.
[00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:23.300]   And I've been making a book of these for my children,
[00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:24.700]   individualized for each of the children.
[00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:27.340]   I'm not done with the project, but I'm gonna finish it.
[00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:30.600]   And I have that printed 'cause they love to look at it.
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:32.900]   My wife makes yearbooks for each of the children.
[00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:37.820]   So every year, we create a standalone printed photo book
[00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:40.620]   of the experience that the child has.
[00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:42.500]   And my children love to go through those.
[00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:43.740]   They love to look at their pictures,
[00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:45.500]   and that really helps cement the memories
[00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:46.900]   of all the things that we did together
[00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:49.100]   and all the good times and the places we went
[00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:50.700]   and the things that we did, et cetera.
[00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:52.620]   And I see this as an application of that.
[00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:53.660]   Here's where we're going.
[00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:55.900]   And I try to put those things that are good
[00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:58.100]   and beautiful and inspiring into the images
[00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:01.100]   and check back in five or 10 years.
[00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:03.400]   But if someone had done that for me when I was a child,
[00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:05.380]   I would have loved that 'cause I want my children
[00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:07.380]   to have something to go into.
[00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:09.780]   And I've been doing pictures for myself as well,
[00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:11.460]   but I haven't followed all the way through.
[00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:14.900]   And I'm newly determined to do more of that,
[00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:19.380]   to create those images because I do really believe
[00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:25.460]   that what the mind can see, what the mind can conceive
[00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:28.480]   and see and believe, the mind can achieve.
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:31.660]   We are goal-achieving mechanisms.
[00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:35.980]   And I don't wanna let my life slip behind.
[00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:38.740]   I wanna be diligent to achieve those things.
[00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:41.020]   And then continuing on, then of course,
[00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:44.180]   virtual can expand outwards to the books that we read.
[00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:47.140]   And I've been doing pretty well with this.
[00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:50.580]   I've been reading a lot more biographies over the last year.
[00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:52.900]   I didn't get into biographies when I was a kid.
[00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:56.220]   I spent years reading basically like nonfiction,
[00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:59.260]   self-help stuff and business books and whatnot.
[00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:00.900]   And I guess a few years ago,
[00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:03.340]   most of that stuff started to feel hollow for me.
[00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:07.260]   And my appetite for any of it just basically disappeared.
[00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:08.860]   And I found it very hard to sit down
[00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:11.060]   and read a nonfiction book,
[00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:13.620]   especially kind of the light, fluffy self-help books.
[00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:16.260]   I've read a few that I think are genuinely helpful,
[00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:18.260]   but it seemed like something happened in me.
[00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:21.740]   And what I longed for was to experience
[00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:23.460]   what other people have experienced.
[00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:26.420]   And so I've been looking for reading biographies.
[00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:29.740]   And I find that really connects with me.
[00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:30.780]   It helps me to connect with them.
[00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:34.540]   I'm reading a book on the Rothschilds right now.
[00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:36.820]   I'm fascinated by the Rothschild family.
[00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:39.540]   And it really inspires me and connects with me.
[00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:43.220]   And so we need to be careful about what we do more of,
[00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:44.260]   of that in our lives.
[00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:47.860]   Because you can, this sounds so like weird,
[00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:52.820]   but really you can commune and connect and interact
[00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:54.820]   with the greatest men and women of history
[00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:58.020]   through their biographies, their autobiographies,
[00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:01.340]   their biographical sketches, et cetera.
[00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:04.020]   And that transforms your circle of influence
[00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:06.460]   to be those men and women that you admire
[00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:07.740]   and that you want to be like.
[00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:11.960]   And it impacts you and it's effective.
[00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:13.820]   So there are many things that we can do
[00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:14.980]   to surround ourselves
[00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:18.100]   with those kinds of virtual influences,
[00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:22.860]   even if we don't have the physical influences
[00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:25.420]   that we might like to have today.
[00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:26.620]   The next thing that we can do
[00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:31.620]   is insert ourselves into the kinds of situations,
[00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:36.300]   into the kinds of things that we want more of in our life,
[00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:38.680]   even if it's on a temporary basis.
[00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:44.920]   It's perfectly reasonable to go places on a temporary basis
[00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:46.980]   and spend time around the things
[00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:49.340]   that you want more of in your life.
[00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:51.620]   And there are many ways that you can do this.
[00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:53.780]   So I grew up near Palm Beach
[00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:56.740]   and I would routinely go over to the island
[00:22:56.740 --> 00:22:59.460]   and just spend time hanging out on the island
[00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:01.960]   because it's a beautiful place filled with beautiful people
[00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:04.420]   and everything is immaculate, et cetera,
[00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:06.740]   and it just makes you feel differently.
[00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:08.660]   Back to the example I gave earlier
[00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:10.540]   of going to a nice hotel and sitting there
[00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:12.660]   and dressing up and saying,
[00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:15.280]   "What do I need to do to comfortably stay
[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:16.980]   at this kind of hotel?"
[00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:18.900]   And surround yourself with those kinds of people,
[00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:21.080]   even if it's on a temporary basis.
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:24.160]   We can do this if you,
[00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:25.880]   let's say it's a character quality
[00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:27.820]   and you wanna be surrounded by people
[00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:29.600]   who are not drug dealers.
[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:31.920]   Well, go to church on Sunday morning
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:34.940]   and surround yourself with people who are churchgoers
[00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:39.280]   and it will impact you and change you and influence you.
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:41.380]   You can experience this if you go to a gym.
[00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:44.680]   You can experience this in any positive sense.
[00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:46.640]   You can experience this if you go to the kinds of place
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:48.840]   where business guys hang out.
[00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:52.020]   It's so much better to go and work at a coworking space
[00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:53.560]   where you're surrounded by other people
[00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:56.160]   than to sit at home where it's just you.
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:58.980]   It's so much better to be connected with these people
[00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:02.740]   and these inspiring places,
[00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:05.240]   these inspiring feelings, et cetera,
[00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:07.880]   even if it's only on a temporary basis.
[00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:09.320]   And I think that that's something
[00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:12.400]   that is accessible to all of us.
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:16.260]   If you want to study more and be more learned,
[00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:19.960]   regardless of whether you are a college student or not,
[00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:23.360]   go to your local college and go sit in a library
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:26.800]   and that library environment will influence you.
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:30.520]   I don't have a longer string of examples to give you,
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:35.200]   but don't neglect the temporary influence
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:36.880]   that is available to you.
[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:40.140]   And as your financial advisor,
[00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:43.960]   don't be scared to spend money on those temporary influences.
[00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:46.680]   I'll talk more about this in just a moment,
[00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:50.840]   but sometimes spending money to be on a trip with someone
[00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:55.080]   that's just a little bit outside of your normal ability,
[00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:57.420]   just a little bit of a stretch,
[00:24:57.420 --> 00:25:00.380]   that can be the thing that inspires you to action.
[00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:04.040]   Now, in many cases,
[00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:08.380]   there are ways to make these experiences more permanent.
[00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:14.240]   And I want to concede quickly that I never knew in the past
[00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:17.120]   whether to believe in this or not.
[00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:20.120]   For example, my parents were not members of a country club.
[00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:23.460]   I would have been prone when younger in life
[00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:26.940]   to make fun of people who were at a country club
[00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:28.680]   or a member of a private club.
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:30.280]   I would have been prone to say,
[00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:31.840]   "There's no point in that, come on,
[00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:33.420]   "why are you spending the money?"
[00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:36.320]   And I just didn't understand.
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:39.000]   And when people would say,
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.120]   "Why should I join the country club?"
[00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:41.760]   It usually sound like some self-serving,
[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:43.240]   "Well, there's gonna be business there, right?
[00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:44.380]   "I'm gonna sell life insurance,
[00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:45.560]   "and so I gotta go to the country club
[00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:46.400]   "'cause that's where all the people
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:48.160]   "are gonna buy life insurance are."
[00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:51.160]   But one of the reasons that people wanna join private clubs
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:53.880]   or exclusive neighborhoods, et cetera,
[00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:55.400]   is simply that they surround themselves
[00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:56.560]   with more of what they want in life,
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:58.760]   and their success becomes easier.
[00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:01.800]   This goes back to why does one person,
[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:06.400]   why does a wealthy parent spend hundreds of thousands
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:09.920]   of dollars in some cases to send a child
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:12.800]   to an exclusive Ivy League university?
[00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:14.240]   People say, "Well, it's because of the network."
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:17.880]   Yeah, but it's partly the network,
[00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:21.540]   but in some cases, is it the network effect?
[00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:25.440]   Meaning that you're basically in many cases
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:27.200]   choosing the peer group that's gonna make
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:29.800]   the kinds of decisions that may rub off on you.
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:31.760]   And is the ability to pick up the phone
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:34.280]   and call somebody who knows somebody really powerful?
[00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:37.520]   Yes, but perhaps it's also the fact
[00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:38.880]   that you're surrounded by people
[00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:40.780]   who know that they can pick up the phone
[00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:43.460]   and call people who can get stuff done,
[00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:45.560]   and that changes the person.
[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:49.560]   That's why I led off with the idea on obesity,
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:52.200]   is that if obesity is contagious,
[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:57.440]   then thinness or athleticism,
[00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:00.120]   or we don't have a good opposite of obesity,
[00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:03.040]   like non-obesity is also contagious.
[00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:05.680]   And if poverty is contagious,
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:08.560]   I think we could make a good argument
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:11.400]   that it at least bears a lot of similarity
[00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:16.280]   to research on obesity, then wealth is also contagious.
[00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:17.760]   And I could justify that.
[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:20.600]   I can't prove it, but I could justify that argument
[00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:22.600]   with a lot of strength.
[00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:26.080]   And so it makes sense to spend money
[00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:31.080]   to put yourself into those situations permanently.
[00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:36.400]   And this is where penny-pinching often doesn't make sense.
[00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:41.720]   It makes sense to move to an expensive city.
[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:42.920]   It doesn't always make sense
[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:45.080]   to just go somewhere else where it's cheaper.
[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:48.600]   If the expensive city has some of the values
[00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:51.040]   and qualities that you want more of in your life,
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:55.560]   it makes sense to live in an exclusive neighborhood.
[00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:58.320]   It makes sense to surround yourself with those things
[00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:00.720]   because they will rub off on you
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:03.680]   and you will be more motivated to make changes.
[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:06.800]   You will be more inspired to take the kinds of actions
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:10.440]   that lead you to have more of that in your life.
[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:11.480]   And this is what I wanna focus on
[00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:12.880]   for the final few minutes of the show.
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:15.440]   How does this relate to wealth?
[00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:18.720]   As far as I can tell,
[00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:23.920]   a great error,
[00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:28.440]   or a great mistake
[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:34.480]   is that we think that wealth is produced by robotic people.
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:38.640]   We think that we ourselves function
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:41.320]   as rational, robotic creatures.
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:45.240]   And yet, this isn't the case.
[00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:49.560]   We're highly emotional, largely irrational creatures.
[00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:50.480]   And by the way, obviously,
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:52.200]   there's a whole field of behavioral economics
[00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:54.080]   that's dedicated to studying this.
[00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:58.600]   I'm not an expert in that, casual observer.
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:02.800]   But in reality, we are highly irrational,
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:06.840]   emotional creatures who look for logical justifications
[00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:09.280]   for our impetuous actions.
[00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:11.160]   We don't articulate the fact
[00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:12.600]   that we make most of our decisions
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:15.480]   based on emotion, passion, et cetera.
[00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:16.920]   We just make our decisions
[00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:18.280]   and then we come up, in many cases,
[00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:19.560]   with a logical explanation
[00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:22.000]   for why we did the thing that we did.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.200]   But what's interesting is,
[00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:29.200]   that irrationality often pays off for many people.
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:32.440]   If you think about something as irrational
[00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:34.120]   as starting a business,
[00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:36.360]   the decision to start a business,
[00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:41.200]   when you sit down and you look at the enormous odds
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:44.440]   against your success in any business pursuit,
[00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:48.480]   it would cause most people to, I think, admit
[00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:52.880]   that most businesses are begun for irrational reasons.
[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:55.960]   But you have a passion for the idea.
[00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:58.280]   You want desperately to make something of yourself.
[00:29:58.280 --> 00:29:59.400]   You want to be free.
[00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:02.040]   You wanna make a bazillion dollars, whatever it is.
[00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:05.440]   And you find an idea and you say, "I want this."
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:07.560]   And then you basically justify it to yourself
[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:10.240]   with some kind of logical, rational argument, et cetera.
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:12.160]   And then you go do it.
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:13.520]   But what's interesting is,
[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:16.760]   the key to a lot of business success
[00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:21.480]   is the lengths that you and I are willing to go to
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:25.920]   to prove that our irrational emotional decision
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:28.600]   was actually the right one to do.
[00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:31.200]   And so we'll work like crazy to justify
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:33.080]   that this new business we started actually works.
[00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:36.560]   And that extra amount of work causes us
[00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:39.720]   to actually have the self-fulfilling prophecy
[00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:42.600]   of the successful business.
[00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:44.840]   And this isn't perfect.
[00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:46.040]   It's not true all the time.
[00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:48.520]   But it's those 80-hour, excuse me,
[00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:53.520]   those 80-hour, those 80-hour weeks
[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:58.240]   that get rid of all of the mistakes
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:30:59.200]   that we made along the way.
[00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:02.680]   And on the back end, we got all the work done.
[00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:03.800]   And then we start justifying.
[00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:06.560]   We forget all the bad because we got the good.
[00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:10.240]   And that applies, I think, to a lot of other areas in life.
[00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:12.600]   You'll see this with someone, again, who'll buy a house.
[00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:16.440]   It is a major decision that generally works out
[00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:17.560]   really well for most people.
[00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:19.640]   They buy a house, but they get way in over their head
[00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:20.640]   and they can't pay the mortgage.
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:23.120]   But then they really wanna keep the house.
[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:25.000]   They wanna justify that this was the right decision.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.160]   So a guy will go out and get two extra jobs
[00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:28.280]   and cut his budget, et cetera,
[00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:30.280]   make those mortgage payments, make those mortgage payments.
[00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:32.320]   And then two years after the valley,
[00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:34.200]   he's still making them and then things are better.
[00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:35.320]   And then for the rest of his life,
[00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:37.720]   that house is a great financial decision for him.
[00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:42.720]   And the irrational goal of keeping the thing
[00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:45.280]   caused him to go and do the extra work.
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:49.440]   Or let's say that someone who gets a job
[00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:50.960]   making a lot of money,
[00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:55.360]   you're gonna go through a professional career formation
[00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:57.800]   that's gonna require you to go to school for 10 years
[00:31:57.800 --> 00:31:59.240]   and you're gonna be underpaid, et cetera,
[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:00.520]   but you wanna do it.
[00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:01.360]   So you go into it
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:04.080]   and you pour enormous amounts of effort into it.
[00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:05.600]   And you question it, is this the right thing?
[00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:06.840]   But you just wanna justify
[00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:08.800]   that you're gonna make it through and you make it through.
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:12.000]   And then on the other side, you make huge amounts of money.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.080]   And these are the kinds of decisions
[00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:18.920]   that ultimately lead to wealth.
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:21.920]   These irrational emotional decisions
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:25.160]   that cause someone to do the work necessary
[00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:27.560]   to actually achieve the outcome
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:29.840]   that they want in the fullness of time.
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:33.740]   Now, perhaps not everybody
[00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:35.920]   is as emotionally driven as I am.
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:38.360]   Perhaps there are people who could,
[00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:40.200]   maybe engineers are the best, right?
[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:44.600]   Engineers seem to have this discipline, this mindset,
[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:47.120]   this consistency, this steadiness.
[00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:49.840]   And engineers tend to have a good job
[00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:51.280]   that pays them a good income.
[00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:52.480]   And they have a tight budget
[00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:55.240]   and they have a beautifully developed
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:56.320]   investment portfolio.
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:58.280]   And they read all the books on financial planning.
[00:32:58.280 --> 00:32:59.800]   They listen to "Radical Personal Finance"
[00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:01.480]   because Joshua said years ago
[00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:03.720]   he was gonna teach the CFP curriculum.
[00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:06.080]   And they just have the consistent plan.
[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:08.120]   And that works, that works.
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:14.080]   But does engineers frequently reach
[00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:15.800]   a couple million dollars, right?
[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:18.680]   A few million dollars, five million dollars?
[00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:20.100]   It's pretty unusual, though,
[00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:22.200]   to find an engineer with a yacht.
[00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:24.680]   I've never met one.
[00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:27.240]   A small boat, yes.
[00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:30.120]   Yeah, a center console fishing boat, yes.
[00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:31.880]   A bass boat, yes.
[00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:33.880]   I've never met an engineer with a yacht.
[00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:39.280]   That's not to say that there aren't a whole lot of people
[00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:41.640]   who've destroyed their lives because of emotionalism.
[00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:44.640]   But it is to say that if you can figure out a balance,
[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:48.400]   how to harness that emotional desire in a positive way,
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:53.160]   control the risk of stupid decisions,
[00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:54.560]   control the downside,
[00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:58.200]   that's probably your most powerful tool.
[00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:01.360]   I hope you'll think about it.
[00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:04.880]   I don't think any of us are
[00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:10.640]   mis-served by surrounding ourselves
[00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:13.240]   with more of what we want.
[00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:17.340]   Be it the kinds of people that we want in our lives
[00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:19.880]   and connecting ourselves with them
[00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:21.800]   by reading books about them
[00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:25.640]   or filling our algorithmic social media feeds
[00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:27.440]   with their stuff.
[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:31.120]   We're certainly not served by intentionally
[00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:32.680]   sticking ourselves in their way
[00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:36.320]   and being the kind of person at the gym at 6 a.m.
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:39.080]   or the kind of person at church on Wednesday night
[00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:41.400]   or whatever version of that is.
[00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:44.880]   And there's a pretty strong argument
[00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:48.340]   for surrounding ourselves with them,
[00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:52.920]   with people, even on a permanent basis.
[00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:58.640]   Am I gonna buy a house on Ocean Reef Island
[00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:00.480]   in Panama City, Panama?
[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:03.040]   I just might.
[00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:05.160]   I just might.
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:08.520]   Are you gonna buy a house
[00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:11.520]   in the exclusive neighborhood in your town?
[00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:12.440]   You just might.
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:18.040]   I don't know if we're ever gonna be able to calculate
[00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:24.140]   the exact outcome of these kinds of decisions,
[00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:27.560]   but I think there's something here
[00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:29.680]   that we should think about more
[00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:31.220]   and we should research more.
[00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:35.120]   I found that author's,
[00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:36.920]   wish I could cite 'em, I didn't look 'em up, forgive me,
[00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:39.200]   but I found that author's paper
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:44.200]   on obesity being infectious to be pretty compelling.
[00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:49.440]   Regardless of the ultimate truthfulness
[00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:51.580]   of the author's claim,
[00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:55.940]   it's kind of a mind virus
[00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:59.180]   that I'll probably never be able to get away from.
[00:35:59.180 --> 00:36:01.620]   And regardless of whether it's proven ever
[00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:04.700]   to be true or not, it's pretty immaterial.
[00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:07.380]   I think it's useful to think about obesity
[00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:09.060]   as an infectious disease.
[00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:11.900]   I think it's useful.
[00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:14.820]   And to me, that's a pretty good standard
[00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:16.420]   for the truthfulness of something,
[00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:17.780]   is that we don't have to say this is true,
[00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:18.660]   but is it useful?
[00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:21.300]   Is information or an idea useful?
[00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:24.820]   And similarly, I think it's useful
[00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:29.300]   to think about wealth and poverty
[00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:32.980]   as an infectious condition.
[00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:35.060]   Let's not put the label disease on it,
[00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:38.420]   an infectious condition. (laughs)
[00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:39.940]   And let's try to surround ourselves
[00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:42.820]   with people who are doing smart stuff with money.
[00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:45.140]   Maybe all the other values are infectious.
[00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:47.460]   I know that if I watch a movie
[00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:49.300]   of a guy acting with courage,
[00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:52.200]   I go out and I'm more willing to be courageous.
[00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:55.220]   Maybe they're all infectious.
[00:36:55.220 --> 00:36:56.940]   I'm not gonna go that far today,
[00:36:56.940 --> 00:37:01.300]   but I do think it's useful to think about them as infectious.
[00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:02.880]   I hope that's useful to you.
[00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:03.820]   Those are my thoughts for the day.
[00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:04.860]   I'll be back with you very soon.
