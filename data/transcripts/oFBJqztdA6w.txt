[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.480]   - Sarah, a podcast listener, writes in
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.700]   with a really great question for you, Pastor John.
[00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:10.540]   Here it is.
[00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.120]   Pastor John, what's the difference
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.360]   between flattery and encouragement?
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.960]   We are called to encourage one another,
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.440]   but also not to puff one another up in pride.
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.180]   So how do I know which one is which?
[00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.760]   What would you say to Sarah?
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.120]   - You could not do better after the Bible
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.440]   than getting a copy of Sam Crabtree's
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:37.440]   extraordinary book called "Practicing Affirmation."
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.200]   And I love the subtitle,
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.200]   "God-Centered Praise for People Who Are Not God."
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:50.600]   Sam mustered a battery of biblical passages
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.400]   and gave such a compelling argument for praising people
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.400]   in a God-centered way that it significantly altered
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.760]   how I think about this.
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.680]   This is quite a remarkable book.
[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.040]   I don't think there's another one like it.
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.520]   So I'm giving it, yes, a very high recommendation,
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.600]   just for the sake,
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.840]   if not all the other practical applications,
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.160]   of the biblical data that Sam has brought together
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.840]   in a way I've never seen anywhere else.
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.900]   So that's an advertisement with joy.
[00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.240]   There is such a thing as flattery.
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.780]   Not all getting is good.
[00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.820]   So we have the word greed, right?
[00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.660]   And not all giving is good.
[00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.840]   So we have the word bribe.
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.580]   Praise, which involves both getting and giving,
[00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.740]   may not be good.
[00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.780]   And so we have the word flattery.
[00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.780]   The Greek word for flattery, kolikia,
[00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.540]   occurs one time in the New Testament.
[00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.920]   Paul is defending his ministry to the Thessalonians,
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.180]   and he says, "We never came with flattering speech,
[00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.300]   "as you know, nor with a pretext for greed,
[00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.460]   "nor did we seek glory from men,
[00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.180]   "either from you or from others."
[00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.860]   And it's, I think, more than coincidental
[00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.860]   that flattery occurs in that sentence with the word greed.
[00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.300]   In other words, I want something from you.
[00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.940]   You're kind of getting at the heart of flattery
[00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.620]   when you think about that.
[00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.620]   The idea of flattery is present, without the word,
[00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.140]   in Jude 1:16, where Jude accuses certain men
[00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.140]   of admiring persons for the sake of their own advantage.
[00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.620]   That's the idea.
[00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.500]   You're admiring and you're saying nice things
[00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.860]   about somebody for the sake of your own advantage.
[00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.660]   Now, lots more is said about flattery in the Old Testament
[00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.700]   than in the New.
[00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.940]   The word flattery is built on the Hebrew word
[00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.500]   for be smooth or slippery.
[00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.500]   So a person who flatters is smoothing and caressing.
[00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.820]   The lips of an adulterous drip honey,
[00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.820]   and smoother than oil is her speech,
[00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.100]   or that's Proverbs 5, 3, here's 7, 21.
[00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.340]   With her many persuasion, she entices him,
[00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.340]   and with her flattering lips, she seduces him.
[00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.460]   The most general statement about flattery
[00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:41.220]   in its destructive effects is Proverbs 26, 28.
[00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.580]   A flattering mouth works ruin,
[00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.220]   or Proverbs 29, 5.
[00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.340]   A man who flatters his neighbor
[00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.220]   is spreading a net for his steps.
[00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.420]   So the key question becomes,
[00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.420]   how can we celebrate or praise good things
[00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.340]   about another person without spreading a net
[00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.060]   for their feet or working their ruin?
[00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.520]   I think the key is to keep in mind
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.820]   the essential difference between good praise
[00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:18.940]   and bad flattery.
[00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.020]   Flattery is bad because it's calculated.
[00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:28.020]   It's given with a view to obtaining some advantage,
[00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.940]   Jude 1, 16.
[00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.620]   Flattery may be true, it may be not true.
[00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.300]   Sometimes people think it has to do
[00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.140]   with whether it's true or not.
[00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:36.380]   That's not the issue.
[00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.780]   You may be saying something true about somebody
[00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.200]   and still be flattery.
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.260]   That's not the issue.
[00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.340]   The issue is whether it's calculated
[00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:49.100]   to achieve some purpose that is not rooted
[00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.460]   in the authentic, spontaneous delight
[00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.820]   that we take in the virtue we are praising.
[00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.500]   In other words, the key mark of genuine,
[00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.180]   non-flattering praise is that it's the overflow
[00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.020]   of authentic delight in what we're observing
[00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:10.500]   about the other person.
[00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.900]   It's the opposite of calculation.
[00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.220]   It's spontaneous.
[00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.020]   Lewis, C.S. Lewis, one of my favorite quotes.
[00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:23.020]   He says, "We delight to praise what we enjoy
[00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.000]   "because the praise not only expresses
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.120]   "but completes the enjoyment.
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.360]   "It is its appointed consummation."
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.340]   Yes, exactly right.
[00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:40.340]   But flattery does not flow from a sincere delight.
[00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.700]   In the thing being praised,
[00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.220]   it's all external and manipulative.
[00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:49.900]   It's elicited out of us by some other benefit
[00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.180]   that we're hoping to get through the flattery,
[00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.740]   not by the benefit that we just got
[00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:57.660]   from the person's kindness or virtue
[00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:00.580]   or beauty or accomplishment.
[00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.700]   So flattery is a form of hypocrisy.
[00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:08.540]   We try to give the impression that we are being moved
[00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:11.940]   by a spontaneous delight in something we admire,
[00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:16.500]   but we're not really being moved by spontaneous admiration.
[00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:21.500]   We're being calculating and we're desiring to use praise,
[00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.420]   to get something.
[00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:28.260]   I think the very phrase, "Use praise," makes me gag.
[00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:29.100]   Exactly.
[00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:33.420]   You're gonna go to God and use praise?
[00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:34.820]   Ick!
[00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:36.340]   It's a horrible way to think,
[00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:39.060]   and it's pretty prevalent today.
[00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:43.020]   So this raises the question of whether it's appropriate
[00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:48.020]   to "use praise" as a means of bringing about behaviors
[00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:53.860]   in children or employees or friends.
[00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:59.580]   Doesn't that imply some kind of calculated use of praise
[00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.860]   for ulterior motives?
[00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:03.660]   And that's a tough question.
[00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:06.120]   I think the answer goes something like this.
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:11.120]   If the praise can still be an expression
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:16.620]   of authentic, spontaneous delight in some good
[00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:22.180]   that we have observed, and if our goal is that the child
[00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:27.300]   or the friend do more of that behavior,
[00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:30.380]   not for the sake of praise,
[00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:35.380]   but because it's intrinsically beautiful and God-honoring,
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:38.620]   then it's legitimate to hope that our praise
[00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:42.140]   will produce more good behavior.
[00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:46.020]   But in general, I think it's dangerous
[00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:47.960]   to think of our praise of others,
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:51.960]   including our children, in utilitarian terms.
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.620]   Children are gonna catch on to this eventually.
[00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:57.340]   They're gonna say, "I don't think Daddy really enjoyed
[00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:58.180]   what I just did.
[00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:00.860]   He's just trying to use it to get me to do something."
[00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:05.420]   Namely, thinking that our praise will bring about behaviors
[00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:08.900]   that we want, that kids are gonna catch on to that.
[00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:10.260]   It's not gonna be authentic.
[00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:11.820]   Our parents are gonna start,
[00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:16.820]   are gonna think like psychologically trained manipulators.
[00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:21.900]   Far better to be the kind of person, the kind of parent,
[00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:26.900]   who sees God-given virtue or God-given achievements
[00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:33.700]   and being so authentically stirred with admiration and joy
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:37.920]   that we spill over with praise.
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:41.820]   And of course, it's gonna have wonderful effects
[00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:44.220]   on our relationships and on the future behaviors
[00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:45.540]   of our kids and others.
[00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:50.540]   But if we start making the utilitarian dimension
[00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:55.640]   of praise prominent, which it is being made prominent today,
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.780]   if we start making it prominent,
[00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:00.440]   it will cease to be authentic.
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:03.520]   And in the long run, I think it will backfire.
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.220]   Just one last help.
[00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:10.020]   I have friends, including Sam Crabtree,
[00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:13.580]   who have taught me that a good way
[00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:17.580]   to conceive of our praising other people
[00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:21.260]   is to think of it as drawing attention,
[00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.400]   spontaneously enjoying and thus drawing attention
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:28.420]   to "evidences of God's grace."
[00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:30.940]   That little phrase is pretty common in some circles,
[00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:32.940]   and I think it's a good one.
[00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:37.940]   If we believe that in sinful human beings,
[00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:43.140]   all virtue is ultimately from God, which it is,
[00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:48.140]   then all praising of true virtue or true accomplishments
[00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:50.420]   or any beautiful traits that we see
[00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:54.780]   will be conceived of as honoring God, not just man.
[00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:58.820]   So it is a good thing in a family, in a church,
[00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:03.100]   among friends, to habitually call attention
[00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:07.700]   to "evidences of grace" in each other's lives,
[00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:10.140]   to say to our children in a dozen ways,
[00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:13.620]   don't have to be mechanical about this, in a dozen ways,
[00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:16.020]   "I love what God is doing in your life.
[00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:20.140]   That was so good of the way you shared your toys with Jimmy."
[00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:23.620]   Kids aren't gonna think, "Oh, Daddy's preaching."
[00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:26.580]   Not if it's authentic, not if it's authentic,
[00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:30.700]   and you really feel joy in what your child just did,
[00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:33.060]   and joy in the grace of God.
[00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:35.740]   But my earnest plea, last thing I'll say,
[00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:39.180]   my earnest plea is try to avoid
[00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:43.060]   utilitarian, calculated approaches
[00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:46.200]   which turn spontaneity into manipulation.
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:48.540]   That's the soil of flattery.
[00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:51.660]   - Yeah, and that is an eye-opening distinction
[00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:54.620]   with a ton of implications for all of our relationships.
[00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:55.980]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:58.660]   And Sam Crabtree's extraordinary book, again,
[00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:00.500]   is called "Practicing Affirmation,
[00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:03.660]   "God-Centered Praise of Those Who Are Not God."
[00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:05.500]   And Sam is not just a writer on this,
[00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:07.260]   he models God-Centered Praise
[00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.360]   in a very sweet way in his own life.
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:11.380]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:15.220]   Well, how should we think of generational sins?
[00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:18.820]   Does God punish us for the sins of our ancestors?
[00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:21.340]   And what about curses and hexes?
[00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:23.960]   Can jinxes and spells plague our lives too?
[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:27.660]   John Piper will return to explain all of this tomorrow.
[00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:28.540]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:31.100]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:33.680]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:36.260]   (upbeat music)
