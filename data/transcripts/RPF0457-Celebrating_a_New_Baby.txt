[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.760]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.880]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.960]   building a plan for financial freedom in ten years or less.
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:17.080]   Today I probably should just skip that intro and say hello, my friends, because I don't
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.520]   have a show here, just a couple of minutes of me chatting.
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.520]   I don't have an outline.
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:22.520]   I don't have a script.
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.360]   Just simply wanted to get on here and explain myself of where I've been the last few days
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.280]   and also update you, my listening friends and listening family here at the Radical Personal
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:38.920]   Finance community, to say that my wife and I invite you to rejoice with us in the birth
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.520]   of our new baby.
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.520]   We've been celebrating here the birth of a brand new baby boy.
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.260]   A mama is doing well.
[00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.520]   Our son is doing very well.
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.000]   And so we have been rejoicing here in the Sheets household and also adjusting.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.560]   Those two things come together.
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.360]   Anytime you have the birth of a new child, it takes a period of adjustment.
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.720]   So that's the basic announcement for you to know.
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.420]   And I want to just again invite you to rejoice with us.
[00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.240]   Everyone is doing well.
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:13.700]   And it's also the explanation for a little bit of my – after a period of a lot of consistency
[00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.700]   here in the show.
[00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.120]   It's also a reason for kind of the ups and downs.
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.000]   Frankly, I have various show outlines that have been swirling around in my head that
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.960]   I thought about trying to integrate today.
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.200]   I've had show outlines called What I Love About Working From Home and What I Hate About
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.200]   Working From Home.
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.440]   I've wanted to get that show done for a while.
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.400]   Another show has been All the Ways to Save Money on Birthing Without Endangering the
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.640]   Life of Your Spouse or Your Baby and various other things like that.
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.400]   But I'm just not prepared to go through those right now.
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.140]   I don't have the mental clarity to do a good job on those shows.
[00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.280]   But I will say this, that one of the favorite things that I have – one of my favorite
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.840]   things about the lifestyle that my wife and I have chosen with my ability to work from
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:08.040]   home and to be near home really comes out in times like this where as we've worked
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.520]   towards the birth and those last few weeks of pregnancy which are the most difficult
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:18.480]   – often the most difficult weeks of pregnancy and then also the birth and then the first
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:25.560]   few weeks after birth, I really appreciate the opportunity that I have to be with my
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.280]   family, to be near to my family and to have a pretty flexible schedule.
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.700]   I know that when I don't publish a show, I know that I leave some of you hanging and
[00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.280]   with a boring commute.
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.280]   I appreciate that.
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.880]   I'm sorry about that.
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.000]   But I also know that you're probably not going to come and beat my front door down
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.720]   with pitchforks and torches.
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:50.480]   I know that I can be flexible and free to focus on my family which is a very high priority
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.520]   for me and I really, really appreciate about that.
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.640]   I do just want to say thank you because I couldn't do it without your listening.
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.240]   I couldn't do it without your support.
[00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.720]   I wouldn't have the opportunity for that.
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.600]   This time around, I've tried to be very available here in my family partly because
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.160]   it's one of my regrets about the birth of our last child.
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.400]   Our last child was born a couple of years ago and during that period of time, I had
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.320]   just launched Radical Personal Finance on a full-time basis.
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:23.680]   I was thick in the middle of working and doing the show and a whole bunch of other things
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.680]   going on.
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:31.320]   So, it was that time I took very little time after the birth for any kind of special family
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.000]   bonding, family adventures, etc.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.760]   So, this time, I've been trying to take a little bit more time and really build some
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.480]   memories and love and support my wife and children during this period.
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.880]   So that explains a little bit of my absence.
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:53.480]   Birth went well and I probably should do an entire episode on some of the things relating
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.840]   to finances and birth.
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:01.000]   Not ready to do that today but if you would like, go back and listen to episode 212 of
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.520]   Radical Personal Finance.
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.360]   That was a joint episode that my wife and I did together after the birth of our second
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.360]   child.
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.600]   We talked about – that episode was titled "Comments We Had a Baby Girl, Comments on
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.920]   Preparing for Childbirth with Mrs. RPF Herself."
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.700]   So if you're interested in hearing my wife and her voice and some of the things relating
[00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:25.800]   to that second birth, that episode is out there, episode 212 of Radical Personal Finance.
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.520]   We had a home birth this time.
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:33.440]   We recommend that to you not just as a money-saving technique, obviously, before the emails start
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.440]   flooding in.
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:40.160]   Obviously, saving money is not a primary goal during birthing.
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.800]   The safety and health and well-being of my wife and our children is the primary goal.
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:51.600]   But as a nice benefit, one great thing is that home birthing is very economically viable
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.320]   and probably much more important because I would pay extra to do it the way that we've
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.400]   done it and we've been blessed to have low-risk pregnancies, which is a real benefit.
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.200]   Not everybody can effectively and safely plan for home birth.
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.560]   But one of the benefits of it is just a much better experience.
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:13.680]   My wife and I, after every baby, we have looked at each other and just thought, "Man, this
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:21.080]   was such a great experience to be able to be together, she and I fully involved in the
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:26.120]   childbirth process, to be able to be at home in our comfortable surroundings where you
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:31.480]   can make the environment the way that you want it to be, to be able to have full control
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:40.880]   and full authority over how you want to birth, not to have a bunch of people in uniforms
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.840]   bustling in and out and disrupting things and telling you, "Sit here, stand there, do
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:46.840]   this, do that."
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:52.400]   We've worked with a midwife who helps out with some of the helpful medical things to
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.020]   make sure that baby's doing okay and that mom is doing okay.
[00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:59.700]   But other than that, midwives generally don't operate with the same authoritarian mindset
[00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:04.560]   that a physician staff and nurse staff does in a hospital.
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:09.320]   So we've just thoroughly loved the experience of having our babies at home, would highly
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:13.640]   recommend it to you if you have any interest or have done any research.
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:20.080]   We've found the process to be extremely, extremely rewarding.
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.160]   And this third child was absolutely that way.
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:29.560]   And I tell you what, for all of you men and dads, for women I know that bearing a child
[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:33.320]   can be an extremely empowering thing.
[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:37.600]   It's one of those major things that separates the girls from the boys, to be able to have
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:42.500]   a baby and to hold life in your hand and to recognize the fact that your body created
[00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.640]   that is extraordinarily beautiful and empowering and precious.
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:51.880]   And as a husband and as a father, I'll tell you this, for those of you aspiring husbands
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:57.040]   or aspiring fathers or who will face that in the future, if you want to feel like a
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.840]   man, deliver your own child.
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.160]   Work with your wife and deliver your own child.
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.720]   Having done it three times now, I found it to be a very just empowering thing.
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:14.600]   And my wife and I really treasure the memories of the births of our children.
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:18.680]   After this was our third baby, we feel like we're – at least I do feel like I'm getting
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.320]   a little bit more of the groove.
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.040]   Every childbirth is different.
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:27.200]   But with this one, I was much more relaxed, was able to really – third time around makes
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.400]   it a lot easier than the first time.
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.200]   I tell people I'm practically a midwife now.
[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.840]   A little backup career if I ever have a problem.
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:35.840]   Male midwives are not common in the United States but you never know.
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.640]   I know that in Europe they seem to be more common than they are here.
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:45.840]   So maybe there's a new market for me, the big hairy bearded male midwife as a backup
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:46.840]   retirement plan.
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:50.080]   Not a bad financial independence business.
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:53.480]   You can come and go with some freedom.
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:57.120]   Obviously, when you're on call, you're just like an obstetrician.
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.320]   When mama's having the baby, you got to go.
[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:02.880]   But you have some freedom and flexibility with your daily schedule.
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:05.600]   It's a very diverse experience.
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.920]   I'm primarily kidding.
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.280]   It's not quite for me.
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.880]   But it was a great birth.
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:11.880]   We're really rejoicing.
[00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:13.520]   The baby is doing very well.
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:19.400]   Healthy nine-pound baby boy, he's doing very well and we're very thrilled.
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:22.400]   We've been praying and praying and praying for a happy baby.
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:27.000]   Our first two babies were just miserable as babies, absolutely miserable.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.480]   The second one, even more so than the first one we thought was bad and the second one
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.480]   was awful.
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:36.400]   Just very, very sick for months and months.
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:41.680]   She had colic and she had, what was it?
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:42.680]   Forgive me.
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:44.200]   I can't remember the medical name.
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.200]   GERD.
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.200]   GERD and colic.
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:51.240]   It basically just means her digestive system didn't work and the stomach acid would come
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:55.640]   up out of her stomach and burn her esophagus.
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.960]   There was very little that the pediatrician could do.
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:58.960]   Very little.
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.560]   You just basically had to wait until they grow out of it.
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:05.960]   But it made for an extremely difficult and very trying first few months.
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:13.340]   We are rejoicing that this baby is happy and contented and we are thrilled with his arrival.
[00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:16.080]   Just working on his integration into the family.
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.640]   Another tip for those of you who are new parents.
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:20.680]   We took the baby to the chiropractor.
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:22.000]   We were talking with her.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.040]   She had just recently had a baby.
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.480]   And I'll affirm this.
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:31.560]   My wife and I, we've developed our standard little speech to give to prospective parents
[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:34.320]   about all the things that they need to know.
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:38.060]   And I'll give it to you here as my listening friends and family.
[00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:43.400]   Just simply to say, one of the most important things is to recognize that it's important
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:44.400]   to prepare for the birth.
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:49.280]   If you're preparing for your first child or beyond your first child, preparing for
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:50.520]   the birth is very important.
[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:52.000]   But nobody stumbles into that.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.680]   You've got nine months to think about it.
[00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:55.960]   You've got a lot of time.
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:59.200]   There are plenty of people that want to tell you stories and give you advice.
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:01.960]   There's lots of things out there that you can study.
[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:02.960]   But I'll tell you this.
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:07.920]   The thing that caught my wife and me blindsided, that blindsided us on the birth of our first
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:14.080]   baby and even as we were talking with our chiropractor on the birth of her baby, the
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:20.320]   thing that really blindsided us was recognizing how difficult it can be in the first days
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:23.240]   and weeks after the birth.
[00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:24.240]   Breastfeeding is very difficult.
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:30.680]   I know I talked about that with the physician that I interviewed last week.
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:36.160]   And breastfeeding is, Marilyn, I forget her last name, breastfeeding can be very difficult
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.080]   making the transition.
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:42.640]   Babies, for those of you who are not parents, the common joke to make to new parents is,
[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:43.640]   "Well, how's the sleep?
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:45.960]   You're not getting any sleep."
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:47.480]   It's rather a silly joke.
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:53.080]   Most people make it with the best of intentions because they mean the best.
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.480]   They don't know what else to say.
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:58.000]   People who aren't parents don't know what else to say to parents and so they talk about
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.320]   and make a joke about the sleep.
[00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:00.320]   It's the standard thing.
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:05.480]   But the reason that new parents' sleep schedules get mixed up is very simple.
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:10.400]   Babies' tummies are really small and babies can't go more than a few hours or they shouldn't
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:14.400]   go more than a few hours without eating.
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:19.440]   Some people, if your baby is not waking up in the night to eat, that's a problem.
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:24.000]   You need to set a timer and get yourself up and wake the baby up.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.840]   It's very important in the first few days and weeks of a new baby's life to do that
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:28.840]   intentionally.
[00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:32.360]   If your baby doesn't want to wake up, you need to wake them up to make sure that they
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:33.360]   eat.
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:38.240]   So that just leads to disrupted sleep schedules where instead of getting a full night, you
[00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:41.200]   wind up getting snatches of sleep here and there.
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:44.400]   And it's just very challenging in those first few weeks.
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:45.780]   So far so great.
[00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:51.840]   We are enjoying the process and really enjoying the addition of this new baby but still focusing
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:59.440]   on doing very little work and trying to spend all of my time maintaining and building back
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:06.160]   and getting the family back on schedule and back into a really workable routine.
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:12.840]   In other news, I'll go ahead and just make this a stream of consciousness report related
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:13.840]   to children.
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:20.560]   My oldest child, my son, has successfully made his first investment.
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:24.320]   So of course being Mr. Radical Personal Finance, I'm very proud of him.
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:28.880]   In short, and at some point, I've got a book outline written on this.
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:31.840]   We'll see if I can get the project finished at some point.
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:37.760]   But in short, he has been accumulating his money steadily.
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:41.200]   He is three years, three and a half years old at this point.
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:46.400]   And I've struggled with a lot of different approaches as far as should you give a child
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:47.960]   an allowance or not.
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:54.980]   In general, I'm opposed to the giving of an allowance primarily because it sounds a lot
[00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:55.980]   like welfare.
[00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:58.520]   It sounds a lot like an entitlement mentality.
[00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:05.240]   That said, I have chosen up till now to go ahead and to give my son an allowance.
[00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:06.840]   I give him a weekly allowance at this point.
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:14.000]   I intend to cut it off as soon as he is able to work and earn money reliably by the sweat
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.060]   of his brow.
[00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:19.800]   So I'm picturing that being around six or seven years old, something like that.
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:25.880]   And the theory that I have behind this at the moment is that I want him to become accustomed
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:30.760]   to handling money so that it's a natural and normal thing.
[00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:38.920]   And I just can't come up with any way for him to handle money on his own unless it comes
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:39.920]   from me.
[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:44.200]   And I want him to have practice of handling money from a very early age.
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:49.400]   So what I've done up till now is, I think I started when he turned three, is I have
[00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:53.480]   given him a three-quarter per week allowance, so 75 cents a week.
[00:13:53.480 --> 00:14:03.080]   Yes, I know I'm overly generous with my child, but hey, it adds up quick if you have it in
[00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:04.080]   time.
[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:06.520]   So I give him 75 cents a week.
[00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:12.480]   And then what he does is he has three – well, they're Ziploc bags is what we use.
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:15.240]   One is for saving, one is for investing and one is – sorry.
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:19.120]   One is for spending, one is for investing and one is for giving.
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:23.080]   And so each week, he puts a quarter into each of those bags.
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:25.040]   And of course, it's important.
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:29.160]   If he's going to have money, no money should come into or out of his hands that's not
[00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:30.160]   tracked, right?
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:33.800]   Fundamental rule of radical personal finance is that every dollar coming in and every dollar
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:35.220]   going out should be tracked.
[00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:38.360]   So we have little ledgers on the cards and of course I write it for him.
[00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:41.560]   But I explain to him and we keep a running tally of each bag.
[00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:48.400]   And as he finds money on the street, I encourage him to find money and to put that money in
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:50.720]   there and we divide it up, I change it out.
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:54.120]   And so every time he receives money, we divide it into three.
[00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:58.320]   And I found this to be – so far, I'm really happy with the decision I've made to pursue
[00:14:58.320 --> 00:14:59.440]   this.
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:05.280]   It helps a lot for – I have found as a young father, it helps a lot for your child to have
[00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:07.500]   a spending budget.
[00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:14.520]   That way, it gives you a good way to divert some of the requests for things.
[00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:19.400]   A lot of the things that he sees that he'd like to buy, the monster truck or the things
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:24.640]   in the stores then allows me to go back to, "Oh, well, do you have enough money saved
[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:27.520]   for that in your spending bag yet?"
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:28.520]   And allows him to do that.
[00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:29.800]   And he's accumulated his money.
[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:32.800]   I remember some months ago, he was very excited.
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:37.480]   He went and bought his first Hot Wheels car all with his own dollar.
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:38.960]   That was a very exciting day for him.
[00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:43.160]   So he's been doing some purchases on the spending category.
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:45.280]   But we were struggling with the investing category.
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:46.680]   It's a real challenge.
[00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:53.400]   How do you teach an almost four-year-old to invest their money in such a way that they'll
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:16:00.840]   understand and gain the concept of investing but to do it with a couple or $3 budget?
[00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:05.240]   It's not an easy nut to crack.
[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:09.480]   How do you profitably invest $3 or $4 in a way that's useful?
[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:11.960]   You can't go and buy a stock for a four-year-old.
[00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:13.160]   That's meaningless to them.
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:18.120]   They can't do complex mathematics and work a compound interest chart at this point in
[00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:19.120]   time.
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:22.600]   So I've kept my eyes open and I posted this question in the Radical Personal Finance Facebook
[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:24.000]   group at some point in the past.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.300]   And some listeners had some great suggestions.
[00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:32.740]   But this last week, he had the opportunity to buy some honey.
[00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:36.360]   So he bought some honey from some family members who were in the honey business.
[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:39.480]   And he bought it at wholesale, little mini bears.
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:42.880]   He'd saved up $6 in his investing money.
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:48.360]   And so he bought five little honey bears from his family members at wholesale.
[00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:53.040]   And he turned around and as people have been coming to our house to rejoice with us and
[00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:57.040]   bring us food after the birth of our baby and see the new baby and everything, he has
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:03.760]   been selling them honey, which warms my little heart to see a little salesman going out there
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:07.560]   and in complete innocence say, "I'm here to try to sell you some honey.
[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:09.160]   Would you like to buy my honey?"
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:10.800]   So success.
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:15.560]   He sold all five of his honey bears, doubled up his money, and he's rolling in the dough.
[00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:22.120]   So we made a little ledger for the investment, showed him his profit, put the seed capital
[00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:25.680]   back in, split the profit out into the three categories.
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:27.480]   And so I'm really happy with the lesson.
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:33.800]   I was just enjoying the fact that he – and he enjoyed the process.
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:39.360]   It's just very rewarding as a father to see just the innocence of a child.
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:42.600]   And yet I know the lessons that he's learning, the lessons of selling.
[00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:45.000]   Not everybody said yes, which is good.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:50.240]   Learned to take rejection at an early age, learning to have success.
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:53.720]   He doesn't quite – can't work all the math on the quarters and the dollar bills
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:56.200]   and the profit and a lot of it is over his head.
[00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:59.160]   But I'm really happy with the progress that he's making.
[00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:02.720]   So I've really been enjoying that the last few days.
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:08.480]   And it has also amply demonstrated to me once again that profits are better than wages.
[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:11.600]   I intend to teach my children to earn wages.
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:16.760]   I think it's very important for children to earn wages, not to be exclusively focused
[00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:17.760]   on profits.
[00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:23.800]   I think that if a child doesn't master the skill of work, hard work, diligent work, work
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:30.000]   for other people, it's my opinion that they miss out on some very important lessons.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:35.740]   That said, profits are better than wages as Jim Rohn used to remind us so consistently.
[00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:40.080]   Profits are better than wages and just seeing how he's been able to turn his quarter a
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:49.360]   week income into – and a $5 investment where he doubled up in one day, doubled up to $10
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:51.520]   was pretty good.
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:57.640]   I was refreshed on some of my own lessons on finance just in watching that.
[00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:59.480]   And we have lots more lessons planned for him.
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:02.520]   Of course, I'm taking good notes so that I can pass along.
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:07.700]   And here, for free, here, for free, I'll finish out my kind of economic theory on children
[00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:13.340]   since I talked about allowances and then with that, I'll wrap up this ramble.
[00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:19.220]   My theory is at this stage, I want to give him money so that he has practice handling
[00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:20.220]   it.
[00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:23.280]   There's so much value in every week taking these quarters, setting them aside, putting
[00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:27.400]   them in the investing, putting them in the spending, putting them in the giving.
[00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:30.100]   It gives him opportunities to look for how can he give money away.
[00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:31.100]   It's a challenge.
[00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:35.780]   How do you give away meaningfully $5 in a way that a child is going to understand what
[00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:36.780]   they're doing?
[00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:40.660]   But I think that's very beneficial.
[00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:42.380]   The accumulating – we don't call it saving.
[00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:43.640]   We call it spending.
[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:49.140]   But over time, naturally, the slow accumulation of money is delayed gratification.
[00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:53.820]   So he's learning the skill of delaying gratification for things he wants.
[00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:57.040]   He's learning to understand how much things cost.
[00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:01.560]   For example, we go to Costco and he has his eyes on the $200 drive-around cars.
[00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:07.760]   Well, if he gets one of those, it's going to come out of dad's pocketbook or grandparent's
[00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:09.680]   pocketbook obviously.
[00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:16.040]   But it helps him to see the scale of how much money different things cost.
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:20.360]   And so I'm really pleased with that and then the investing as well.
[00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:23.120]   I've got lots of plans for the investing.
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:29.960]   But my theory is that by giving him an allowance until he can work and earn wages, then that
[00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:35.240]   will help him to build the skills of money management so that it will be second nature.
[00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:38.500]   I want to start young so that it's second nature to him.
[00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:41.160]   Then when he's able to work, I don't know the age.
[00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:42.560]   I haven't been there as a father.
[00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:47.360]   But my guess is seven, eight, nine, ten years old where he'll start to be more of a help
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:51.880]   and not a hindrance and we can arrange little jobs whether it's cutting grandma's yard
[00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:56.640]   or whether it's cleaning the toilets for the man next door or whatever those circumstances
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:59.400]   are that we can find for him to earn wages.
[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:08.960]   Then at that point, my plan is to discontinue the allowance or change its character because
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:13.880]   the third phase, or at least keep the allowance so small that it's relatively meaningless
[00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:20.800]   compared to what he can earn from working to find out that working is how you earn money.
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:22.320]   That's the most effective way.
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:26.560]   Money doesn't just come and flow to you in checks that show up for your existing.
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:28.360]   Money comes from work.
[00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:34.680]   But then the third phase, of course, is my hope is that a lot of the expenses that I
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:40.800]   as a parent owe to my child just simply for my parental duty for their care, that I'll
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:43.840]   be able to transition those over to him.
[00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:48.920]   For example, I think that there's no reason why a 12-year-old shouldn't be responsible
[00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:51.560]   for their own clothing purchases.
[00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:58.800]   My intention is to figure out what is an appropriate budget at that point in time for a child to
[00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:02.960]   spend on a child's clothing, to lay out the appropriate standards for the child's clothing
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:04.280]   and say, "Here are the standards.
[00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:07.480]   Here are our parental standards for the type of clothing we wear."
[00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:11.600]   Then hopefully by that time, we'll have taught him how to shop.
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:13.320]   Here's what you get if you shop in this manner.
[00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:17.480]   Here's what you get if you do this other thing, et cetera, and to transition the budget over.
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:22.040]   He will still have income coming in from me, but it'll be income that's responsible to
[00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:24.980]   provide for those maintenance items.
[00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:25.980]   That's my hope.
[00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:30.360]   So I'll expand on all this in the future, but spend a lot of time thinking about it,
[00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:34.040]   reading what other parents have done, learning from what has gone well, et cetera, and that's
[00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:36.360]   where I'm at at the moment, subject to change.
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:41.120]   So that's a little insight into Joshua's week.
[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:42.480]   That's what's going on around here.
[00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:48.400]   I'll be back with you as soon as I can, but number one priority right now is my wife and
[00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:49.400]   our family.
[00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:52.720]   So with that, I'm going to end today's show and get back to it.
[00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:54.960]   Talk with you soon.
