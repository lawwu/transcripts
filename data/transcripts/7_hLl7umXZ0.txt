[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.960]   Well, if a wife is more spiritually mature than her husband, how does her husband lead
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:11.960]   her spiritually?
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.280]   It's not an uncommon situation.
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.160]   It's not an uncommon question in the inbox, and it's up next in an email from a young
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.160]   man.
[00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.160]   "Pastor John, hello.
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.520]   How do I lead my wife spiritually when she is more spiritually mature than I am?
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.800]   I became a true follower of Christ years after my wife, and her spiritual maturity is far
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.160]   greater than mine.
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.920]   For most of my marriage, I have been a poor leader of my family, especially in spiritual
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:34.920]   matters.
[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.520]   But by the grace of God, I am growing in my faith, and I am slowly starting to take the
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.460]   reins of leadership in my family.
[00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.240]   My wife's discernment, desire, and dependence on the Lord are incredible examples, and I
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:53.160]   often ask for advice and discernment in my search and reading through Scripture.
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.360]   How, Pastor John, can I lead her better?"
[00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.360]   Let's start with the foundations.
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.760]   I'm going to get to very specific responses to his question, how to lead a woman who's
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.280]   ahead of you like this.
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.280]   But I just think way more important than those particular suggestions are getting foundations
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.360]   clear.
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.440]   So let's do that for a few minutes.
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.200]   Ephesians 5, 23 to 25.
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:26.600]   The husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church, his body,
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.640]   and is himself its Savior.
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:35.560]   Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit in everything to their
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.560]   husbands.
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:43.160]   Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her.
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:50.400]   Now that's all very, very radical in every culture on planet earth.
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:58.080]   It is a restoration of what God established in the Garden of Eden and a transformation
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:04.160]   of the mess that the relationship became after the fall.
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:14.880]   So it recaptures what God originally designed, and it redeems what was ruined in that design
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:15.880]   by sin.
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.840]   That's the point of Ephesians 5.
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:27.920]   It restores headship or leadership, and it transforms that leadership by modeling it
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.300]   on the self-giving love of Christ for his church.
[00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:39.480]   When Paul was finished in Ephesians 5 describing the relationship of husband and wife in this
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:50.360]   recovered and renewed dynamic, he said in verse 32, "This mystery is profound, and I
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:57.480]   am saying it refers to Christ and the church."
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.520]   The mystery of marriage refers to Christ and the church.
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:09.520]   The reason he calls marriage a mystery is not that it can't be understood, but that
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:18.280]   it was kept secret for thousands of years and has now been most fully revealed in relation
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.120]   to Jesus and his church.
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:29.320]   In other words, the secret that human marriage is modeled on the coming relationship between
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:36.000]   the incarnate, crucified, risen Son of God and his blood-bought bride, the church, is
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   mysterious.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.120]   That's the meaning of the mystery or the secret.
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:46.440]   There were hints of it, the mystery, in the Old Testament because God called himself the
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.160]   husband of Israel.
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:04:00.200]   But this full-blown pattern of Christ and the church is a new revelation and very radical
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.440]   in every culture on the planet.
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:12.640]   The reason that calling marriage a mystery is relevant right here is because it tells
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:24.520]   us that when God created man as male and female, he already had in view Jesus Christ and his
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:32.760]   church as the model for Adam and Eve and all marriages to follow.
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:43.960]   This means that the wisdom of God created male and female in such a way, with such male
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:52.280]   and female natures, that in their most godly manifestations they would rejoice in and flourish
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:58.160]   in the living out of Christ-like headship and church-like submission.
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.520]   He made them that way.
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.080]   That's the mystery.
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.840]   It was the model from the beginning.
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:13.240]   The distinct calling of each of them would fit their created design.
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.160]   The calling would fit the design.
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:22.600]   They would be perfectly suited for this dynamic of leadership and submission.
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:31.160]   In other words, calling this relationship a mystery in Ephesians 5 assures us that God's
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:40.960]   design of male and female from the beginning included this glorious destiny of the man
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:48.000]   echoing Christ in his role as husband and the woman echoing the church in her role as
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   wife.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:58.120]   One of the reasons I'm stressing this is that I want you to have a clear sense of why you
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:07.680]   are called to lead your wife, even when she is superior to you in significant ways.
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.840]   What is your calling to lead rooted in?
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:16.280]   Because if you don't get that clear, you'll probably just bail on this and say, "Well,
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:19.160]   there's no point in trying to do this."
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:26.360]   I don't want you to say, "Well, the reason I am called to lead is because I am called
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.360]   to lead."
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:32.320]   There are a lot of people today who more or less take that position.
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:36.760]   Men should lead their families on the basis of the fact that men should lead their families.
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:42.800]   Or to put it another way, God says in the Bible that men should lead their families
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.360]   because men should lead their families.
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:54.200]   I want to discourage you from thinking that God flipped a coin in the Garden of Eden when
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:59.080]   he was deciding about leadership in the home.
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:07.860]   I want to encourage you not to think that God said, "Well, here we have two human
[00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:14.800]   beings that I have made, and there's nothing about them as I have created them that would
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:22.520]   make it fitting or especially beautiful for either one to always be the leader.
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:28.200]   I have not made them that way, and nothing about their male or female differences make
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:34.880]   it better or more fitting that one should be the leader."
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.800]   But I want somebody to be the leader.
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:40.120]   So let's flip a coin.
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.720]   Heads, Adam leads.
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:45.120]   Tails, Eve leads.
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:46.120]   Flip.
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:52.240]   Heads, there you go, settled for all of history, codified in a book.
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:53.240]   God said so.
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:56.480]   This is the way it's going to be because I say so.
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.480]   I flipped the coin.
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:01.200]   I don't want you to think that.
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:08.120]   I think that notion of why you should lead because God just flipped a coin or God said
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:15.200]   so dishonors, discredits the wisdom of God.
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:20.080]   I don't think God decides anything about flipping a coin, ever, for the simple reason that if
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:23.520]   he did, he controls which way the coin lands every time.
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.480]   So there's no point in flipping the coin.
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:33.840]   God never does anything whimsically or randomly, ever, because he's governed always by infinite
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:34.840]   wisdom.
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:38.720]   "Oh Lord, how manifold are your works in wisdom.
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:41.760]   You have made them all."
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.720]   That's what you do.
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:51.480]   His decisions always reflect the profound suitableness and beauty of what he decides,
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:58.240]   and that applies to the decision that husbands are called to be the leaders of their wives,
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:04.200]   and we're both fitted to these distinct callings.
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:13.240]   So here we are at your question, and you are pointing out that it doesn't necessarily look
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:20.560]   like you are especially fitted for leadership and she especially fitted for submission.
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:28.720]   You say that she is spiritually more mature than you are and that her discernment, desire,
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:33.420]   dependence on the Lord are wonderful examples for you.
[00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:37.160]   So how are you going to lead her?
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:38.880]   Well here's my answer.
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:49.360]   First, by being thankful and expressing thankfulness to her and to others that she is as mature
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:59.920]   and discerning and godly as she is, and by not being the least intimidated or resentful
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:00.920]   of it.
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:03.520]   That's your first job.
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:11.120]   Confident, Christ-exalting thankfulness that you have such a wife.
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:14.080]   Oh my, what a gift.
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:24.040]   Second, realize that what makes your leadership fitting and beautiful is not your superior
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:31.720]   knowledge or your superior wisdom or your superior insight or your superior language
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:33.440]   skills.
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:42.400]   She may be ahead of you in all of that, and yet the fitness of your leadership is still
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:45.600]   firmly in place.
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:53.680]   I'm not denying that knowledge and wisdom and the ability to speak are helpful in exercising
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:57.440]   leadership, but they're not the essence of it.
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:58.560]   No, no, no, no.
[00:10:58.560 --> 00:10:59.560]   They're not.
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:07.480]   Nor are they the essence of what a godly woman hopes for in her husband's leadership.
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:18.600]   The essence of this God-given call on your life as husband is a mature, loving sense
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:23.040]   that you bear a primary responsibility for the relationship.
[00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:26.160]   Let me say that again, because that's the heart of the matter.
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:35.680]   The essence of the fitness for your leadership is that you sense a call, because it's there
[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:45.680]   from God for every man, a mature, loving sense that you bear a primary responsibility for
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:52.080]   this relationship, especially the flourishing of the spiritual life of the relationship.
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:12:02.320]   You should feel a uniquely masculine burden that the buck stops with you for making this
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:05.360]   relationship work.
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:14.040]   When anything is not working in this relationship, you feel the primary responsibility to get
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:22.600]   it fixed, even if she has the wisdom to fix it and you ask her to use it.
[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:33.800]   God created men to bear this burden of mature, loving, Christ-like primary responsibility
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:35.680]   for the relationship.
[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:44.680]   She has her responsibilities, but you take special initiative and bear primary responsibility
[00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:50.040]   before God that God's pattern be joyfully fulfilled.
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:58.120]   That's your calling, and it does not depend on being her superior.
[00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:05.120]   It depends on faith and courage and initiative and sacrifice.
[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:06.120]   Amen.
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.120]   Thank you, Pastor John.

[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:31.600]   Well, humans are movers.
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:32.760]   We move, literally.
[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:36.080]   We can make new homes all over the world in different countries.
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:43.080]   We travel, we sightsee, and as soon as wooden ships could traverse oceans, we jumped continents.
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:48.180]   And then steam engine boats of iron came along, and then came commercial jets.
[00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:50.320]   Most of the world is open to us today.
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:55.840]   So what's the difference between the frenetic globetrotting of an unsatisfied soul and the
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:14:02.120]   movement of a globetrotting soul satisfied in Christ and moving on mission?
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:04.520]   We'll find out next time on Wednesday.
[00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:06.160]   I'm your host Tony Renke, and we'll see you then.
