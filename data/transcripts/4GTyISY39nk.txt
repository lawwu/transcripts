[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Marilynne Robinson, the modern day novelist, wrote a beautiful book titled Gilead, which
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   won the 2005 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   And in one place in the book, she makes a striking statement.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   I want your thoughts on this, Pastor John.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   She writes this on page 52, "In eternity, this world will be Troy, I believe, and all
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   that has passed here will be the epic of the universe, the ballad they sing in the streets,
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   because I don't imagine any reality putting this one in the shade entirely, and I think
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   piety forbids me to try."
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   So what do you think?
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   Will this life be a ballad of eternity?
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   Obviously, there will be no tears, no regrets in heaven, but are there any biblical clues
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   on the place of world history in eternity?
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   I would love to know what she means by "piety forbids me to try."
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   I know what I mean when I say yes to your question, because I agree with her, at least
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   insofar as I understand her, I agree with her.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   When Troy is mentioned, not everybody might get that.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   Troy was the city that the Greek states were attacking to try to capture, and it was a
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   ten-year conquest, and Homer wrote the Iliad about it, and the Iliad, I think, focuses
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   pretty much on the last several weeks of that conquest, and Troy is captured, and so the
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   bravery is heralded for generations to come, and the Odyssey is about the coming home of
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   Odysseus, and so in other words, it's a great historical exploit that is told and written
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   in poems for generations to come, and she's saying, "In the age to come, after Christ
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   returns, and the kingdom is established, and the new heavens and the new earth are in place,
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   the last thousands of years of church history that we are living in right now are going
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   to be that, that balladry.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   They're going to be that, that, and I think that's right, so here's my reason.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   What is history for?
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   What is history for?
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   All your—this is Psalm 145—all your works shall give thanks to you, O Lord.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   All your saints shall bless you.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   They shall speak of the glory of your kingdom and tell of your power to make known to the
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   children of man your mighty deeds and the glorious splendor of your kingdom."
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   And I want to say, "What?
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   They're just going to stop?
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   All of that is magnificently worth heralding now, and it won't be magnificently worth heralding
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   then?
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   I don't think so."
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   What does Christ's work mean?
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   When I read in Revelation 5 that they are singing, "In heaven worthy are you to take
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   the scroll and to open its seals, for you were slain, and by your blood you ransomed
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   people for God from every tribe and language and people and nation."
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   They're singing that ages after the event.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   In heaven, they're singing about the cross.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Now, what meaning could the cross possibly have in heaven if the history of redemption
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   is forgotten?
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   Nothing.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   It will be meaningless.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   In other words, if you say, "What will be celebrated about Jesus Christ?"
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Surely, he will be celebrated for having fulfilled all the promises of the Old Testament.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   Surely, he will be celebrated in ways we've never seen by fulfilling everything the history
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   of redemption was all about.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Surely, he will be celebrated by being the ground and cause of every good thing that
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   happened after him in the world.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   And so, if Christ really is the center, the apex of redemptive history, for that apex
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   to have its meaning, then the rest of history of which it is the apex has to be known and
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   understood and celebrated as well.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   And here's another pointer.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Revelation 15.3, they sing in heaven, they sing the song of Moses, the servant of God
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   and of the Lamb.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   Now, the song of Moses is Exodus 15, where they're singing about the triumphs of the
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   people of God over Pharaoh.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   So, if we're singing about the Lamb and we're singing the song of Moses, surely that is
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   symptomatic of singing the songs of the triumphs of God in world history right down to the
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   salvation of Tony Ranke.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Surely, right?
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   Why would your story not be told and not be remembered to the praise and the glory of
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   God?
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   You're a trophy of grace.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   Well, I think those trophies are going to be walking around in the kingdom.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   And if you see a trophy on somebody's shelf, you say, "What's that?"
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   And he tells you about the game, right?
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   The game and the season when the trophy was won.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   Or here's another clue.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   "We must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ," Paul says, "so that each one may
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   receive his due from the body, what is good and what is evil."
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   Well, if you're going to receive something for what was good, though the good is going
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   to be remembered and something is going to happen to you that will constantly call to
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   mind the good.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   So there's another evidence.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   Or the ten talents.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   You know, you're going to be serving over ten cities.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   I'll be serving over five cities.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   And there will be some explanation for that.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   And the explanation is it has roots back in this age.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   Now, I think you asked also, "Well, wait a minute.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   There's a lot of sad stuff in this age and he's going to wipe away every tear."
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   Okay, here's my take.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   And you can say this is speculative maybe, but I don't think Jesus is going to wipe away
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   tears of joy.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   When he says every tear will be wiped away, he means painful tear, tear that is destructive
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   and hurtful and paralyzing.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   And it makes my life miserable to have these tears and these memories.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   But if my -- I mean, I'm sure most of our listeners will agree that the deepest joys
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   have sometimes brought tears rather than laughter.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   Tears of stunned amazement that we've been treated so well and those tears aren't going
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   to be wiped away.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   They're beautiful.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   You can see the sparkle of grace in those tears.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   And if you would ask me, "Well, will there be regrets?"
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   Hmm.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   You know, for years, I have tried to put together two texts that I think gives an answer to
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   this.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   One is Philippians 3 where it says, "Forgetting what lies behind."
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   We strain forward to the goal.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   So you're supposed to forget what lies behind.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   And the other is Ephesians 2 that says, "Remember that you were once separated from Christ."
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   So you've got a command to forget and a command to remember.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   How do you put those together?
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   I put them together like this.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   "Every regret and every memory will be done away with that cannot serve your greater joy."
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   Cannot serve your greater love for Jesus, your greater valuing of grace.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   So he will wipe away every way of remembering, every way of regretting that ruins your joy
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   in heaven and minimizes his mercy and minimizes his glory.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   But I think, Tony, that Marilyn Robinson is right that we have a great Troy in redemptive
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   history, and God will see to it that all the mighty works of grace done in the thousands
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   of years leading up to the second coming will not be forgotten.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   And yes, she's probably right that piety should prevent us from wanting it to be forgotten.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   Yes. Thank you, Pastor John.
