[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600]   Automating parts of your machine learning workflow
[00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.040]   allows you to ship faster and build more robust products.
[00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.760]   You may have heard of CI/CD tools,
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.080]   which are popular for automating software development tasks.
[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.840]   But how can you use these tools for ML?
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.000]   I've spent years operationalizing ML
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.920]   in both large and small companies.
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.320]   Through this journey, I have learned when
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.660]   and how to use CI/CD for ML.
[00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.920]   And now I want to share my knowledge with you.
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.960]   In this course, I'll teach you how to determine
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.320]   if CI/CD is right for your project.
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.520]   I'll also teach you how to quickly get started
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.800]   and how to integrate tools like weights and biases
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:34.640]   into your workflow.

[00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.640]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.220]   (upbeat music)
