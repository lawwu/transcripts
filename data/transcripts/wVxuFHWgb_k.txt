[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620]   Welcome to the Bogleheads Chapter Series.
[00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.480]   This episode was jointly hosted by all the Life Stage Chapters and recorded February
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.360]   4th, 2025.
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.980]   It features Adam Cordova, a specialist in collaborative family law, presenting the topic,
[00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.160]   how to use prenuptial and postnuptial agreements as financial planning tools.
[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.960]   Bogleheads are investors who follow John Bogle's philosophy for attaining financial independence.
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.640]   This recording is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as personalized
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.640]   investment or legal advice.
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.640]   So hello everyone.
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.480]   I'm Alan, one of the coordinators for the Retired Life Stage Chapter, but tonight's
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.720]   topic will be relevant for many Bogleheads, regardless of life stage.
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:50.640]   Statistically, over 40% of first marriages and 60% of second marriages end in divorce,
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.520]   often with significant financial impact to all involved.
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.080]   Unfortunately, the potential role for pre- and postnuptial agreements as financial planning
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.480]   tools remains somewhat taboo in everyday conversation, and is only occasionally discussed in the
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.560]   forum with virtually no mention, actually, in the Bogleheads Wiki.
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.560]   For that reason, we scheduled this meeting to provide a current overview of the topic.
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.760]   And we're very fortunate to have our guest presenter this evening, Adam Cordova, who's
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:21.860]   a Boglehead and a Florida-based lawyer specializing in collaborative family law and an expert
[00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.000]   on the topic.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.280]   Rather than me muddling up his bio, I'll let Adam introduce himself and proceed with his
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.520]   presentation and questions and answers.
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.520]   Thank you very much, Adam.
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.280]   I'll turn the mic over to you.
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.400]   Well, Alan, thank you so much.
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:50.520]   Let me share my screen and, okay, so Alan, can you see the screen?
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.520]   Yes.
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.760]   Everybody else can see it?
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:54.760]   Right.
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.120]   All right, perfect.
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:02.120]   So, we're going to be talking today about how to use prenuptial and postnuptial agreements
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.280]   as financial planning tools.
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.040]   But before we do, I'd like to provide just a few disclaimers.
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.280]   Disclaimer number one, I'm a lawyer.
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.920]   I like disclaimers.
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.160]   If you don't like it, well, sue me.
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.500]   And disclaimer number two, please don't sue me.
[00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.980]   You see, Alan, that's what we in the industry call a lawyer joke, okay?
[00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.440]   I just want to make sure.
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.440]   Okay.
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:36.400]   Anyways, disclaimer number three, I am a lawyer, but I am not your lawyer.
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.780]   As Alan mentioned before the recording, this is not legal, financial, or tax advice.
[00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.960]   This is for educational purposes only.
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.320]   And disclaimer number four, I am only licensed in Florida.
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.960]   So, I hope to make this broad enough to be generally applicable and I think regardless
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.720]   of where you actually live, you'll find something that could be helpful.
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.920]   But just please keep in mind, if you don't have pythons swallowing alligators and iguanas
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.840]   falling out of the sky nearby, I don't know your state's laws.
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.640]   So, a little bit about me.
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.720]   My name is Adam Cordova, as Alan mentioned.
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.680]   I'm the Managing Attorney at Family Diplomacy, a collaborative law firm.
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.640]   We're a Florida-based law firm with offices in Tampa, St. Petersburg, and Sarasota, and
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.280]   we represent clients virtually throughout the state of Florida.
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.400]   Our website is FamilyDiplomacy.com.
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.560]   Few other things about me, I practice exclusively in out-of-court dispute resolution.
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.500]   I stopped taking court cases in 2015 because I found that for the most part, we were pitting
[00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.900]   husband versus wife and parent versus parent.
[00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.200]   That didn't align with my values, so I stopped litigating in 2015.
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.600]   We've actually grown our practice quite a bit since then.
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:57.440]   I'm the co-editor and co-author with an LA attorney known as Forrest "Woody" Mosten,
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.120]   building a book called Building a Successful Collaborative Family Law Practice, published
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.720]   by the American Bar Association in 2018.
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.800]   I'm also the recipient of the Florida Academy of Collaborative Professionals Inaugural Visionary
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.400]   Award for establishing their Leadership Institute.
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:19.120]   But probably more pertinently, I started reading Dave Ramsey books a few years ago, probably
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.900]   like many of you all, to get rid of my damn student loans.
[00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:28.960]   But that led me down a course of reading JL Collins' Simple Path to Wealth, of listening
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:35.440]   to a few podcasts, Choose FI, White Coat Investor, and Sound Investing, and finally to some Boglehead
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.920]   YouTube videos, where I got a little bit more familiar with Rick Ferry and the conferences.
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:45.240]   And that led me to joining the Tampa Bay Bogleheads chapter last year.
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.960]   That's how I got to know, that's how I met Alan.
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.040]   So let's start off with a question for you all.
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.880]   When you hear the term prenup, what is the first thing that comes to mind?
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:05.940]   I ask that you please write your answer down in the chat or feel free to feel free to raise
[00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.560]   your hand.
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:24.200]   So when you hear the term prenup, what is the first thing to that comes to mind?
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.280]   Protect money, finances, okay, good, yeah.
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.280]   What else?
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.600]   My partner loves their money more than they love me for our first marriage.
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:32.600]   Sure.
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.200]   Yeah, I've heard that.
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.200]   Protect yourself and your children.
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.760]   Someone is not going to like it.
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.400]   That can oftentimes be the case.
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.400]   Yeah.
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.120]   We'll talk about ways that we can help deal with with that.
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.120]   Good.
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.120]   Good.
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.880]   Agreement before marriage.
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:53.440]   Yeah, I'd say that that's a pretty good definition of a prenup.
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:59.720]   And I'll give a definition in just a moment and also protect your assets, potentially
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.320]   an unromantic conversation.
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:08.320]   Gosh, I'd love to have a candlelit dinner over prenups and postnup, wouldn't you?
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:12.560]   I mean, anyways, well, I'd say that's that's probably fair.
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:18.560]   Let me pull my screen back up.
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:23.240]   So so let's just talk, run through what we're going to be talking about today, and maybe
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:28.480]   we can answer some of those ideas, those those questions that were in the chat.
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:33.000]   First off, we're going to be providing some definitions talking about what is a prenup
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.640]   and a postnup.
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:39.840]   How can they say how can they serve as financial planning tools?
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:44.220]   Who would most benefit from a prenup or postnup?
[00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:48.800]   Are there ways to make them more binding in case you need to enforce them?
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:54.520]   And is there a way to make it a better or more fair experience or maybe as some people
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:59.000]   would like to think who wrote in the chat, is there a way we can make the experience
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.240]   suck a little less?
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.440]   We'll talk about that.
[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:06.920]   Here's here's the thing to know, though.
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.960]   Not everyone needs a prenup.
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:15.600]   As the guys on ChooseFI like to say, this is just another tool for your toolbox, another
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.140]   lever for you to pull.
[00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:22.860]   Some of this stuff you may find really interesting and applicable to you, and if so, you should
[00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:24.140]   explore it more.
[00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:26.420]   And if not, that's OK, too.
[00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:27.420]   Not everybody needs one.
[00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:32.180]   We're going to talk about who it may be best for, but in some circumstances, who may not
[00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:35.460]   need the prenup.
[00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:40.900]   Here's one thing to know, a prenup is not a new idea.
[00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:45.660]   There's the Jewish concept of a ketubah, which is a Jewish marriage contract.
[00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:49.700]   It's a practice that has existed for over two millennia.
[00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:54.320]   And similarly, in the Islamic faith, there's the nikah, which is said to be traceable back
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.460]   to the Prophet Muhammad.
[00:07:56.460 --> 00:08:02.380]   Both are contracts that address property rights in the event of during a marriage.
[00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:07.540]   And also, both of them address, oftentimes, what happens if a marriage ends.
[00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:12.900]   So this is, again, not a new or novel concept.
[00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:18.100]   I want to briefly, before we go into other topics, just kind of talk about the various
[00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:21.060]   different types of agreements that you may hear.
[00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:26.680]   And first off, there's the prenuptial agreement, and here's how I like to define it.
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:34.380]   It's a written and binding plan signed by a couple before a marriage that usually addresses
[00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:39.320]   how they want to manage their finances during and after a marriage.
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:46.080]   And we know that marriages tend to end one way or the other, either by divorce or slightly
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.320]   more hopefully by death.
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:51.920]   So just something to keep in mind.
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:55.600]   Prenuptial agreement is actually known by a few different things.
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:59.880]   Your jurisdiction may call it one of several different things.
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:08.080]   It can be known as a prenup, a premarital agreement, an anti-nuptial agreement, and
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:10.720]   an anti-marital agreement.
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:14.720]   And I just bolded A-N-T-E.
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:20.760]   It's not A-N-T-I, which would mean against nuptials or against marital, but A-N-T-E,
[00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:25.880]   which means before the nuptials, before the marriage.
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:29.400]   But we do come across some agreements that have those as their titles.
[00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:33.920]   So they're all the same thing, means the same thing.
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:40.720]   It's just something to know is that Florida and 27 other states and the District of Columbia
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:46.760]   have adopted what's known as the Uniform Premarital Agreement Act, which is just a uniform way
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:50.760]   of discussing, accepting, and interpreting agreements.
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:59.240]   I'll leave that screen on for just a moment so you can see if your state is on there.
[00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:04.040]   Even if your state is not on there, that does not mean that your state does not allow prenups
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:05.040]   or post-nups.
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:10.720]   It just hasn't adapted or adopted a form of the UPAA.
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:15.560]   I'd say that some of the discussion here is probably going to be most relevant to the
[00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:22.080]   UPAA states, but as I said, even if your state has not adopted this Act, I think you're going
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:26.560]   to find some things that will be relevant anyways.
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:31.460]   Then there's the idea of a post-nuptial agreement, and the truth is it's pretty much the same
[00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:37.480]   thing as a prenuptial agreement, but it's signed during a marriage, and it also can
[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:41.080]   be called a post-nup or a post-marital agreement.
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:45.560]   We're actually going to be talking a little bit later in this presentation about times
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:52.360]   where it actually may make more sense to enter into a post-nuptial agreement and may actually
[00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:59.080]   be more binding to enter into a post-nuptial agreement as opposed to a prenuptial agreement.
[00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:03.840]   There's three other agreements I just want to very briefly mention, although I'm not
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:06.360]   going to spend too much time on them.
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:13.040]   There's the Cohabitation Agreement, also known in some cases as a domestic partnership agreement.
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:19.560]   This is simply an agreement that establishes contractual rights between unmarried people
[00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:24.880]   for quite some time before marriage was legal between people of the same sex.
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:30.240]   Instead of having rights that were allowed by statute by their states, instead they created
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:34.040]   contractual rights by these types of agreements.
[00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:41.920]   So it hasn't only been used for folks who are in the LGBTQ+ community.
[00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:52.040]   I had a client who was going to marry their fiancee in a religious ceremony, but for whatever
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:55.960]   reason, they did not want to actually go through a civil ceremony.
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:59.800]   They just didn't want to have anything to do with the state, with registration, anything
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:00.980]   like that.
[00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:08.360]   So instead of doing a prenup, we did a domestic partnership agreement, which laid out all
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:12.880]   of the rights and even said that in the event that at some point they did get married, this
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:17.840]   agreement would convert into a prenuptial agreement.
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:21.360]   There's also a Marital Settlement Agreement.
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:25.880]   This is an agreement that is entered at the time of divorce.
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:30.480]   I'm going to be providing a few different tips throughout this presentation.
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:32.660]   So here's tip number one.
[00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:38.380]   It's usually better to address financial issues before you are angry at each other.
[00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:45.160]   So this can be in a prenup or a postnup, but just something to keep in mind.
[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:49.720]   Finally, there's a topic known as a Collaborative Marriage Planning Agreement.
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:55.400]   So this is actually a very, very, not many people know about it, not even many attorneys
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:56.400]   know about it.
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:00.400]   This is a very novel approach, which I've helped develop.
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:06.120]   It's a new type of agreement, some elements of which are binding and some not, and they
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:11.680]   help couples create three to five year strategic plans for their marriage.
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:17.400]   When I say some parts are binding and some parts are not, some parts of the agreement
[00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:22.240]   can actually serve as a binding prenuptial agreement, but other parts may delve into
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:29.480]   areas that can't be enforced by an agreement, like what are your parenting styles?
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:37.360]   What are your views on how you want to eventually leave money for children and grandchildren
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.840]   that may not be there?
[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:49.080]   So it really takes a holistic view of planning your marriage, and this can be something that
[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:54.960]   supplements marriage counseling or financial counseling, and just if anybody has interest
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:59.560]   in it or they know of an attorney who'd like to learn more, I wrote a chapter about it
[00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:04.760]   or I have a chapter about it in my book, Building a Successful Collaborative Family Law Practice,
[00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:06.400]   published by the American Bar Association.
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:15.620]   So enough about that, because this discussion will focus primarily on prenups and postnups.
[00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:24.240]   So this section, we're going to focus on how can prenups and postnups serve as financial
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:25.240]   planning tools?
[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:30.920]   Of course, that's the main topic of our discussion, and we're going to really examine five different
[00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:31.920]   ways.
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:40.640]   First off, how they can be used for divorce prevention, for asset protection, for asset
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:47.640]   management, debt responsibilities, and for inheritance planning.
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:55.640]   Before I continue on, let me just mention that I have provided a copy of these slides
[00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:56.640]   to Alan.
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:02.380]   I understand Alan is going, or somebody is going to send them out to everybody who registered.
[00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:07.280]   So these are yours for free, so you don't need to take vigorous notes if you don't want
[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:08.280]   to.
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:09.280]   Okay.
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:16.600]   Let me just clarify, what I'll do is have Lady Geek post a link on the forum, and there's
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:19.780]   a Boglehead file repository.
[00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:26.800]   We can't email it, or I don't have a list of who registered, but we'll make it available.
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:27.800]   Thank you, Alan.
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:31.960]   Thank you for that clarification, and actually, before I continue, because we went through
[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:38.360]   a bunch of definitions, I just wanted to check in to see if there were any questions, and
[00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:47.520]   if there was anything in the chat, or if anybody wanted to have any questions yet.
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:48.520]   I don't think so.
[00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:52.440]   I haven't seen anything, but Alan, this is going to be recorded and put out on Boglehead's
[00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:54.160]   YouTube also, correct?
[00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:55.160]   Okay.
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:56.160]   All right.
[00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:57.160]   Sounds good.
[00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:01.200]   It'll be on YouTube, Alan, or Adam.
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:02.200]   Okay.
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:12.040]   I've been called a lot worse things, Miriam, so, all right, Alan and Miriam, sounds good.
[00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:17.280]   Let's talk about divorce prevention.
[00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:19.800]   Here's just a fact.
[00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:23.560]   Divorce is one of the biggest financial challenges that you can face.
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:29.720]   In fact, I tell families all the time, even though that's a big part of my practice, collaborative
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:34.000]   divorce, even in the best of circumstances, even in collaborative divorce, a process I
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:41.360]   very much believe in, divorce is very tough, and if you can avoid it, you should.
[00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:49.800]   If that means by a therapist, by speaking together with a friend, with a minister, please
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:59.400]   do so, and really, divorce should be a last result, but prenuptials and post-nuptial agreements
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:00.400]   can help.
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:09.240]   We'll talk about some ways that they can help, but it's important to know, Alan cited a statistic.
[00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:16.680]   What I know or what I've heard is that nearly 50% of divorces or 50% of marriages end in
[00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:24.280]   divorce, and so here's a question, and again, feel free to put the answer down in the chat
[00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:30.340]   or feel free to raise your hand or just shout out the answer if you know it.
[00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:38.580]   What is one of the biggest causes of divorce?
[00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:40.920]   What is one of the biggest causes?
[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:50.920]   Yeah, I think Jeannie and JC and Mohammed got it right away, money problems, money issues,
[00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:53.360]   finances, absolutely.
[00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:57.920]   Here's one thing about prenups and Monique as well.
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:05.400]   Prenups and post-nups require financial disclosure, so from the very beginning, you get to know
[00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:12.440]   each other's finances, so there's a bit of transparency that is actually a requirement
[00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:20.120]   for an enforceable prenup or post-nup, and both of you get the opportunity to see each
[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:29.320]   other's finances, so that at least starts the base of an important conversation.
[00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:35.560]   Prenups and post-nups, in my opinion, should provide an opportunity for challenging but
[00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:42.000]   necessary conversations, and here's a few that I suggest, that I suggest that even before
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:50.020]   we start drafting anything, that my client engage with their spouse with my help as needed.
[00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:56.260]   What is each of your histories on saving, spending, and investing?
[00:18:56.260 --> 00:19:00.520]   What are your current views on these?
[00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:08.320]   During the marriage, to what extent do you want financial integration or financial independence,
[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:13.400]   and the truth is that most people are on somewhat of a spectrum.
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:18.580]   Yes, there are some people who want total financial integration, and there are others
[00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:24.080]   who want total financial independence, but most people fall somewhere in the middle,
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:28.360]   and if you can have these conversations up front, especially before the marriage for
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:35.420]   a prenuptial agreement, you'll be setting yourself up for a stronger marriage, in my
[00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:45.160]   opinion, and by the way, if both of you say that really you don't want any financial independence
[00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:50.440]   whatsoever, that both of you are on the end of the spectrum where you both want total
[00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:55.180]   financial integration, you may not need a prenuptial agreement.
[00:19:55.180 --> 00:20:02.080]   There may not be things that you need to separate out, so just something to keep in mind.
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:06.520]   What does financial security mean for you?
[00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:11.120]   How can it be achieved?
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:19.200]   And one thing, and by the way, financial security means different things for different people.
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:24.940]   One of the things that I suggest, because obviously there's a lot of focus on alimony,
[00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:29.800]   how much is it going to be, is it being waived, what types of it, all these sorts of things
[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:35.680]   that are on people's minds, but I like to generally ask first off, well, why?
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:36.800]   Why are you asking that?
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:42.520]   Because I'm truly curious, and usually that gets down to what is financial security for
[00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:43.520]   you?
[00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:48.520]   And here's just another tip, a clause that I do tend to put in prenups and postnups during
[00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:56.880]   the times where a client may be totally against any type of alimony.
[00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:04.120]   Something that I may suggest is to fund separate Roth IRAs and HSAs as an alimony alternative.
[00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:07.840]   If there's one spouse who just says, I want a total and absolute waiver.
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:11.560]   By the way, we're going to talk later about why that may not be the best idea to have
[00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:16.360]   an enforceable agreement, but if that's the case, here at least is an option that you
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:19.880]   all can consider.
[00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:27.080]   I want to talk about another way that a postnuptial agreement especially can serve as a divorce
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:29.640]   preventative.
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:35.560]   There are times, interestingly enough, I was actually listening earlier to one of the White
[00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:40.760]   Coat Investor podcasts, it happened soon after COVID, I think in May 2020, and they were
[00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:48.800]   talking about financial infidelity and somebody just had a terrible experience and they ended
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:55.160]   up getting divorced.
[00:21:55.160 --> 00:22:00.240]   I see cases like this a lot, where there is some sort of financial infidelity.
[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:07.440]   What I mean by that is either gambling or having an affair and spending finances on
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:08.440]   that affair.
[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:12.760]   It could be not just a financial infidelity, it could be physical, romantic infidelity
[00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:20.160]   as well, where people are just on the brink of getting divorced and they just can't think
[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:23.120]   of any alternative.
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:29.360]   One thing that I suggest to them is that a postnuptial agreement could be an alternative
[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:30.360]   to divorce.
[00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:33.240]   Here's why I say that.
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:41.200]   In many of those cases, especially with financial infidelity, one of the big issues is a total
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:43.160]   lack of financial trust.
[00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:49.520]   Again, as part of this, the process requires financial disclosure and it can help bring
[00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:55.440]   about a binding agreement that allows for financial security and it can put that in
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:23:00.360]   place and have it ready in the event that there is a divorce.
[00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:06.880]   I find that a lot of times, once these challenging conversations, and yeah, they are challenging
[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:13.120]   conversations, once they're over, there can be a bit of relief on the shoulders of both
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:20.320]   of their clients and that may just open up the space for then the folks to engage in
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:29.040]   therapy or again, go to a rabbi or imam or priest or minister and see if they can repair
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:30.040]   their marriage.
[00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:34.760]   So, just an option that is different than divorce.
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:39.840]   Again, I do divorce, that's most of my practice actually, but I want to make sure that people
[00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:44.400]   know that post-nups can be an alternative.
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:49.920]   Okay, so we talked about divorce prevention.
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:54.400]   Let's talk about how the tools can be used for asset protection.
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:24:05.600]   Just a few concepts, this applies in Florida, but it applies, I understand, in most other
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:06.880]   jurisdictions as well.
[00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:13.240]   There's usually a division between premarital assets and marital assets and premarital assets
[00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:19.600]   are generally separate things that are purchased or acquired prior to the marriage.
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:25.840]   Marital assets, at least in Florida, and again, in many other jurisdictions as well, are assets
[00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:32.280]   that are purchased or acquired during the marriage, regardless of who purchased or acquired
[00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:35.360]   it, regardless of whose name is on titling.
[00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:42.000]   And so, these are the definitions that apply by default without an agreement.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:47.680]   But some people run into issues and don't recognize that there can be a premarital asset
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:55.880]   that can be converted or even have a portion become a marital asset.
[00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:58.600]   And so, here's a couple examples, a home.
[00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:02.920]   Let's say somebody purchased a home before the marriage and titled it solely in their
[00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:07.520]   name and the mortgage was also solely in their name.
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:15.080]   Well, to the extent that they pay off the mortgage during the marriage, without a post-nuptial
[00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:21.480]   or pre-nuptial agreement, that creates a marital portion of a premarital home.
[00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:25.320]   And again, people are just shocked to hear this.
[00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:30.320]   When they come to me for divorce services, they think just because it was titled separately,
[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:33.160]   it would be totally their premarital assets.
[00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:35.560]   That's just not the case.
[00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:41.040]   Similarly, without a pre-nuptial or post-nuptial agreement, if you have a brokerage account
[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:50.080]   or 401(k) or really any account that was acquired and funded prior to the marriage, but you
[00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:57.640]   contribute to it during the marriage, then there will be at least a marital portion of
[00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:03.920]   that separate 401(k) or brokerage account or depending on your state, it could convert
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:13.800]   the entire account to a marital brokerage or 401(k) account.
[00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:17.360]   There are some other assets that may be worth protecting.
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:27.440]   For example, if you get an inheritance during the marriage, if it's kept separate and it's
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:33.080]   left alone, it would be considered separate property in most states.
[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:39.680]   Similarly, a gift from family that you received during the marriage, if it was kept separate
[00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:40.680]   and not touched.
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:44.480]   And when I say kept separate, meaning like if it were funds in a separate account or
[00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:50.560]   separately titled and not touched, then it could be considered completely separate and
[00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:54.260]   you may not need a pre-nup or post-nuptial agreement.
[00:26:54.260 --> 00:27:02.240]   But there are things that can be done which could convert a premarital account or inheritance
[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:09.320]   or gift to a marital inheritance or gift, so co-mingling.
[00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:16.080]   If you earn funds during the marriage and you place it in an account that includes an
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:21.980]   inheritance or includes funds from a family and you don't have a pre-nup or post-nup,
[00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:30.480]   that could convert a portion or the entire account to marital.
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:31.480]   Is that?
[00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:32.480]   Is that?
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:33.480]   Yeah, Alan.
[00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:35.060]   >> No, I'm curious.
[00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:42.620]   So if you have an account, you receive an inheritance, child receives an inheritance,
[00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:51.360]   they're married, but they have a pre-nup that specifies that that inheritance is left.
[00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:55.080]   It's left or intended for that one individual.
[00:27:55.080 --> 00:28:00.320]   If they subsequently co-mingle monies in that same account, is that still fully protective
[00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:04.400]   of at least the initial balance from that inheritance legally?
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:08.120]   >> Yeah, great, great question.
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:13.800]   So I was just talking about what happens if there's not a pre-nup or post-nup.
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:19.600]   Most pre-nuptial agreements or post-nuptial agreements will address that if funds go into
[00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:25.320]   the account, whether or not it would be those funds that were put into the account, whether
[00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:28.140]   the account itself would be affected.
[00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:34.040]   So that's definitely something to speak with a lawyer about that particular thing.
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:42.060]   Some agreements are pretty comprehensive and include not just titling and what goes in
[00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:48.320]   or out of that account, but also address whether income earned during the marriage, if earned
[00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:53.360]   by one person, whether all or a portion of that would be considered marital or non-marital.
[00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:57.360]   By default, without a pre-nuptial or post-nuptial agreement, it all would be considered marital.
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:02.520]   But some agreements say, look, if I have an income during the marriage and put it into
[00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:08.480]   an account that is titled separately in my name, that will remain separate.
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:19.360]   And something else, in the event that you didn't have a pre-nup or post-nup and you
[00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:29.840]   used separate funds for marital purposes, so let's say your grandma Sadie ended up leaving
[00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:36.440]   you a nice chunk of money during the marriage and you kept it separate, but you ended up
[00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:45.360]   using those funds to pay for your expenses throughout the marriage, that very act, depending
[00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:51.920]   on your state, without a pre-nuptial or post-nuptial agreement can convert a portion or the entire
[00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:56.320]   account into a marital account.
[00:29:56.320 --> 00:30:02.200]   So again, the pre-nup and post-nup can help prevent those types of issues from happening.
[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:07.440]   So a lot of the folks that we see are folks who have extensive gifts from families or
[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:14.360]   inheritance, or as we discussed before, pre-marital assets.
[00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:21.480]   A few other things about asset protection that pre-nups and post-nups can help.
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:28.400]   Private businesses, most people don't realize that without a pre-nup or a post-nup, a business
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:33.360]   that is established during the marriage is actually a marital asset.
[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:38.760]   And even if you're a one-man shop and don't have an inventory things, maybe you're in
[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:43.320]   the service industry, you may be wondering, well, how the heck could my business be considered
[00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:44.320]   an asset?
[00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:45.480]   How would it even be valued?
[00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:50.000]   Well, there's an entire industry of folks who value businesses of all kinds.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:57.300]   There's even a designation of it, accreditation and business valuation.
[00:30:57.300 --> 00:31:00.320]   So that's something to keep in mind.
[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:08.320]   Using a pre-nup or post-nup can prevent a business from being considered marital and
[00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:10.200]   keep it as separate.
[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:17.560]   Similarly, and we kind of similar to the discussion on the houses or the accounts.
[00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:24.000]   If you have a business that is established before the marriage, but it grows during the
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:29.080]   marriage, and again, this depends on your jurisdiction and without a pre-nup or post-nuptial
[00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:37.760]   agreement, that growth can create a marital portion of your pre-marital business.
[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:44.760]   So that's something to keep in mind, the pre-nup or post-nup can prevent that.
[00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:49.280]   Alan, I see your hands up.
[00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:53.800]   - Yeah, there's JC posted a question in the chat.
[00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:59.600]   If one party has an investment property acquired prior to the marriage and a brokerage account
[00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:04.760]   funded prior to the marriage, and during the marriage pays the mortgage and upkeep of the
[00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:09.720]   investment property only from that previously funded brokerage, does the other party have
[00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:12.600]   any ownership of the investment property?
[00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:16.640]   - Yeah, so that's a great question.
[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:23.600]   And so I'm gonna give you the ultimate lawyer answer, which is, it depends.
[00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:30.840]   It depends totally on your jurisdiction, 'cause one state may treat that scenario very, very
[00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:34.440]   differently than any other state.
[00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:38.920]   But what I can tell you is in most states, you can have a pre-nuptial or post-nuptial
[00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:41.800]   agreement that addresses that very scenario.
[00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:44.040]   All right.
[00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:45.040]   But good question.
[00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:51.800]   I'm sorry I couldn't be any more specific than that.
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:33:00.960]   For retirement or deferred compensation, again, sometimes people think because they have income
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:10.160]   that's not part of their regular income, that that income doesn't necessarily count when,
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:13.760]   in the event that they go through divorce and they don't have a pre-nuptial agreement,
[00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:19.320]   and things such as alimony or child support are being calculated, deferred compensation
[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:26.400]   and sometimes even retirement can count as income for those purposes.
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:31.680]   Pre-nup or post-nup can carve those out so that in the event of a divorce, those types
[00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:35.200]   of things may not be included.
[00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:42.320]   So we kind of talked about those situations where you may wanna protect assets as being
[00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:47.120]   separate rather than joint, but I think there are situations that are kind of the opposite
[00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:52.840]   of that, where you may wanna designate some assets where by default under your state,
[00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:54.600]   they would be considered separate.
[00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:59.040]   You both may decide that you want them counted as joint.
[00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:13.620]   And so an example of that might be because of, say, a credit issue or other issues.
[00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:20.280]   A couple before the marriage decides to purchase a house together, but only titles it in one
[00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:26.040]   person's name and the mortgage is only in one person's name, but during the marriage,
[00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:31.240]   they plan on moving together and for all intents and purposes, they just both consider it marital
[00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:34.880]   property even though it's titled in one person's name.
[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:39.860]   A pre-nuptial or post-nuptial agreement can actually say, you know what, even though that's
[00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:45.080]   titled separately, in the event anything should happen, that should be considered a marital
[00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:51.320]   asset for all intents and purposes.
[00:34:51.320 --> 00:35:02.640]   I did wanna actually go back just for a moment on something that I mentioned in terms of
[00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:08.480]   brokerage accounts and commingling in 401(k)s, and this may be especially relevant to this
[00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:09.480]   group.
[00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:17.000]   You may have heard the concept of tax loss harvesting, and that's just an idea, a way
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:28.960]   of saving on taxes if the market goes down and let's say that VTSAX is worth less than
[00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:30.560]   what you initially purchased for.
[00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:37.960]   You may decide to sell VTSAX to get a loss and to be able to save on taxes, possibly
[00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:44.260]   for this year, possibly for future years, and then purchase something else that's kind
[00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:50.120]   of similar but not the same thing, let's say VOO, which is the S&P 500.
[00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:56.520]   So you sold VTSAX, which was the total stock market, and then you purchased VOO, which
[00:35:56.520 --> 00:36:04.100]   is the S&P 500, and a lot of folks know that those kind of go on similar trajectories,
[00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:08.520]   so you're basically having pretty much the same thing, but you're able to get some tax
[00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:10.360]   advantages for doing that.
[00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:17.660]   The thing to know, if you did that in a premarital taxable brokerage account, just that active
[00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:26.380]   trading could convert a portion of that premarital account into a marital account.
[00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:31.000]   So I just wanted to mention that, that just came to mind for those who might be engaging
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.060]   in tax loss harvesting.
[00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:36.620]   Yeah, Alan.
[00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:42.620]   Yeah, there's another question from Monique asking, "If someone inherits money from a
[00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:48.020]   parent who dies during a marriage, I presume they inherit, like the spouse dies during
[00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:53.420]   the marriage, how does that affect the assets and who do they belong to?"
[00:36:53.420 --> 00:37:06.500]   Yeah, another really great question, and I've got to put my phone down, so I'm going to
[00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:15.860]   put my lawyer hat on again, and say it really depends, it really depends which jurisdiction
[00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:27.100]   that you're in, and what I can tell you is that in my home state of Florida, what happens
[00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:33.140]   is that if it's kept in a separate account, and not touched, not actively traded, not
[00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:38.980]   really used for any purposes, just kind of allowed to sit and grow and kept separate,
[00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:43.580]   then it would remain separate property, you know, even if you don't have a prenup or post
[00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:48.300]   nuptial agreement, but as we discussed, at least in Florida, and I think in a lot of
[00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:53.420]   other jurisdictions as well, if you start doing things by putting it in different names
[00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:58.340]   or using it for different purposes or actively trading it, that could create portions that
[00:37:58.340 --> 00:38:09.260]   may be marital, and again, whether or not it's joint property depends on the state,
[00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:17.580]   in the state of Florida, if somebody receives an inheritance, and it's an inheritance just
[00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:22.980]   to that one particular person, then it's considered that person's separate property, if it's an
[00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:29.340]   inheritance or something to both of you, then it would be considered joint or marital property,
[00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:34.180]   but if somebody did something like put an inheritance into a joint account, or put the
[00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:39.100]   inheritance into an account owned by the other person, or put that inheritance in an account
[00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:43.580]   that is their own separate account, but it's generally used for marital purposes, then
[00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:50.420]   that can change the entire nature of that inheritance from premarital, or sorry, from
[00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:53.100]   non-marital to marital.
[00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:59.580]   So again, it really just depends on your jurisdiction.
[00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:06.900]   And so, this asset purchase together before the marriage, this can also be used in situation
[00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:15.900]   where there's longtime partners, and again, I've mostly seen this in same-sex couples,
[00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:22.620]   I believe it was 2015, where the right to marry was established throughout the United
[00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:31.140]   States, and so there are people who've been together for many, many years, but only married
[00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:37.860]   in 2015, and so without a prenup or postnuptial agreement, the court will only look at what
[00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:43.780]   happened during the marriage, but with that prenup or postnuptial agreement, you can count
[00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:49.340]   all of the time that you were together as marital time and marital property for all
[00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:54.780]   purposes, for calculating alimony in case that's an event, but also for establishing
[00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:59.580]   which property should be considered joint and which property should be considered separate.
[00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:05.380]   Again, depending on which jurisdiction that you're in.
[00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:14.220]   So we talked about divorce prevention, we talked about asset protection, there's also,
[00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:17.780]   briefly I'll touch on asset management.
[00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:24.140]   Without an agreement, your state may limit how you manage your assets.
[00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:29.580]   Maybe that you need to title things a certain way, or that you can only have certain beneficiary
[00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:35.620]   designations on different types of policies or different types of accounts, and many of
[00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:42.420]   these states allow you to change that if you have a prenuptial agreement or a postnuptial
[00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:47.260]   agreement that says so, and I'm going to get a little further into this a little bit more
[00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:55.180]   in depth when we talk about inheritance planning, but I just wanted to mention that these agreements
[00:40:55.180 --> 00:41:01.500]   can help you title things or designate beneficiaries in a way that you would prefer that might
[00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:06.300]   not otherwise be allowed in your particular state.
[00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:11.820]   So now let's talk about debt responsibilities.
[00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:21.500]   So here's something to know, in many states, without an agreement, any debt incurred during
[00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:27.780]   the marriage is the responsibility of both spouses, and this is regardless of who, excuse
[00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:34.180]   me, who incurred the debt, who knew about the debt, whether it was in joint names or
[00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:40.220]   separate names, it doesn't matter if a debt was incurred in many states, then both of
[00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:43.880]   you are responsible for that debt.
[00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:49.660]   So prenups and postnups allow you to address a few different things.
[00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:55.180]   It allows you to address, first off, what happens to debts associated with premarital
[00:41:55.180 --> 00:42:01.060]   property, and a lot of people think that, hey, if it's premarital property and we take
[00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:05.860]   out a debt, so for example, if there's a premarital house and you take out a home equity line
[00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:12.260]   of credit or a second mortgage, that because it is associated with the premarital property,
[00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:18.300]   that it should be considered a premarital or separate debt as well.
[00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:23.660]   And so a prenuptial or postnuptial agreement will allow you to designate that.
[00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:31.460]   Debts associated with private businesses, similarly, if somebody has a business that
[00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:36.740]   they are owning and managing during a marriage, the debt incurred in that, even if it was
[00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:41.020]   a premarital business, the debt could be considered marital.
[00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:47.260]   And so a prenup or postnup allows you to designate that as solely that one spouse's responsibility,
[00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:51.860]   whoever is associated with that business.
[00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:55.900]   Agreements can also include any knowledge or notification requirements, and I see this
[00:42:55.900 --> 00:43:02.740]   quite common, that the only way that a debt could be considered marital or joint during
[00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:08.180]   the marriage is either if both people are knowledgeable about it or both people consent
[00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:14.740]   to it, or there's at least some sort of notification that the debt was being incurred.
[00:43:14.740 --> 00:43:18.220]   Again, without these agreements, it doesn't matter if you knew about it or not, if it
[00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:22.820]   was incurred during the marriage, in a lot of states, it would be considered marital
[00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:24.420]   debt.
[00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:32.500]   And then also debts incurred together prior to the marriage, you know, depending on your
[00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:33.500]   state.
[00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:37.620]   For example, you know, I talked about my, you know, I got into this whole thing in the
[00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:42.980]   first place because of my own student loans, student loans can be a big part of people's
[00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:43.980]   debt base.
[00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:51.220]   And so a prenup or postnup can help specify in your particular state, whether those debts
[00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:56.660]   should be considered marital or premarital, or if one spouse pays the other spouse's debt
[00:43:56.660 --> 00:44:04.220]   off, whether there should be some sort of credit for that or not.
[00:44:04.220 --> 00:44:10.580]   Now let's talk about inheritance planning.
[00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:18.540]   So with an agreement, your state may limit how you distribute your assets when you pass.
[00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:27.340]   So for example, in my home state of Florida, you are required to pass at least a certain
[00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:34.700]   percentage of your estate, and this is calculated in ways that are too complicated to address
[00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:35.700]   right now.
[00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:45.100]   But you're required to provide a certain percentage of your estate to your spouse and provide
[00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:48.740]   certain other rights to your spouse.
[00:44:48.740 --> 00:44:54.740]   Even if you write them out of your will, it doesn't matter that writing out would be considered
[00:44:54.740 --> 00:45:00.900]   null and void and your estate when you did pass would still have to provide certain minimum
[00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:01.900]   things to your spouse.
[00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:04.660]   And you may think to yourself, well, yeah, that makes sense.
[00:45:04.660 --> 00:45:07.740]   You don't want to write your spouse out of your will.
[00:45:07.740 --> 00:45:09.420]   And that offers a lot of protections.
[00:45:09.420 --> 00:45:14.180]   And for the most part, I absolutely agree with you in most situations.
[00:45:14.180 --> 00:45:19.260]   But there are certain situations where that may not make certain sense.
[00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:21.340]   And let me give you an example.
[00:45:21.340 --> 00:45:26.940]   I had a client who was in his late 70s.
[00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:33.500]   He actually had married his spouse 25 years ago.
[00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:40.740]   So it's a long-term marriage, but it was also a second marriage for both of them.
[00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:47.300]   And my client was independently financially secure and his wife was also independently
[00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:49.900]   financially secure.
[00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:53.980]   But you know who was not independently financially secure?
[00:45:53.980 --> 00:46:00.340]   Each of their children, their adult children, were not independently financially secure.
[00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:06.760]   And so what they decided upon is that neither of them really needed those minimum requirements
[00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:08.820]   under Florida law.
[00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:14.100]   And so they both decided that they wanted their inheritances not to go to each other,
[00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:17.820]   but to their respective children.
[00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:22.940]   And with a prenup or postnuptial agreement, you can waive those requirements that are
[00:46:22.940 --> 00:46:25.340]   otherwise binding under Florida law.
[00:46:25.340 --> 00:46:32.620]   And again, you may be able to do this in your jurisdiction as well and provide things the
[00:46:32.620 --> 00:46:36.140]   way that you want for inheritance planning purposes.
[00:46:36.140 --> 00:46:41.140]   Now keep in mind, this agreement is not going to address the specifics about what happens
[00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:42.660]   to your inheritance.
[00:46:42.660 --> 00:46:48.840]   You still need Will's Trust and other documents for that, but at least this can waive the
[00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:54.820]   rights or waive the requirements under your specific jurisdiction's laws.
[00:46:54.820 --> 00:47:00.780]   So with an agreement, you can decide to what extent your state's limitations may make sense
[00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:06.500]   or not, given your particular circumstances, whether and how to protect children from a
[00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:08.980]   prior marriage or relationship.
[00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:14.140]   And also, and this may be a good tip, if you are having a prenup or postnup, whether your
[00:47:14.140 --> 00:47:18.100]   agreement should include a life insurance requirement, and again, it's going to that
[00:47:18.100 --> 00:47:24.340]   interest of financial security, and this may be a way to enhance the financial security
[00:47:24.340 --> 00:47:27.700]   for all involved by including life insurance.
[00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:28.700]   Alan?
[00:47:28.700 --> 00:47:34.860]   >> Yes, regarding the last comment you made about the states, I saw a video once that
[00:47:34.860 --> 00:47:40.900]   was interesting, a comment whereby he said that every marriage has a prenup, either the
[00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:46.500]   one that you craft yourself as a partner or the one that the state crafts for you.
[00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:51.700]   >> Yeah, yeah, no, I think that's very well put.
[00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:57.620]   Thank you so much, Alan, for sharing that, and it's true, whether you like it or not,
[00:47:57.620 --> 00:48:05.060]   there's a default, and in essence, your state's default law can be considered your prenup,
[00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:08.740]   and part of the question may be do you want to be a little more proactive in making your
[00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:15.940]   own prenup rather than the default law, so thank you for sharing.
[00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:21.980]   So let's talk a moment for who would most benefit from a prenup or postnup.
[00:48:21.980 --> 00:48:28.380]   So first off, people who are already established or older couples, again, who are financially
[00:48:28.380 --> 00:48:35.780]   independent and indultant are not necessarily relying on the assets or income from the other
[00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:37.060]   spouse.
[00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:41.780]   People who are in second marriages or blended family, especially those with children or
[00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:51.540]   adult children, I had a case where I represented a client in his collaborative divorce, and
[00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:59.980]   then afterwards, he ended up getting engaged.
[00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:03.380]   There wasn't any affair during the marriage or anything like that, it's just that's kind
[00:49:03.380 --> 00:49:11.500]   of how things progress, but he had an adult son who had severe anxiety disorder, and the
[00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:21.260]   son was really, really worried about what would happen to not just the father, but also
[00:49:21.260 --> 00:49:29.860]   the son himself in the event things kind of went sideways, and so in this situation, I
[00:49:29.860 --> 00:49:35.580]   represented this former collaborative divorce client as a new prenuptial client to help
[00:49:35.580 --> 00:49:42.260]   create a prenuptial agreement to, if nothing else, soothe the anxieties of the son and
[00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:47.240]   to help make my client's life a whole lot easier.
[00:49:47.240 --> 00:49:53.480]   These owners, we discussed the protections that private businesses can have with a prenup
[00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:58.480]   or postnuptial agreement, those with large inheritances, again, there's different unique
[00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:04.280]   reasons why LGBTQ+ families, that's lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer and other
[00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:11.960]   families who may need a prenup or postnup, and going to Alan's point, people want to
[00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:18.280]   make their own rules and not just go by the "default" prenup.
[00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:23.880]   There's also, I think more and more these days, a healthy skepticism towards people
[00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:28.320]   in black robes and those otherwise in authority, and so rather than leave it up to them, people
[00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:33.800]   want to make their own rules, and similarly, there are those who want to put a premium
[00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:43.900]   on privacy, and so if you can have some touchy issues addressed ahead of time and make it
[00:50:43.900 --> 00:50:49.040]   less likely to have to have these issues resolved in court in the future, you're going to have
[00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:51.920]   a lot more privacy protections.
[00:50:51.920 --> 00:51:05.240]   Okay, all right, so here, this next topic is on how to make your prenups and postnups
[00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:13.360]   more binding, and just a tip, one thing to know, prenups and postnups are found unenforceable
[00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:21.980]   all of the time when not done properly, and one of the things that I like to tell clients
[00:51:21.980 --> 00:51:30.480]   is don't think of a prenup or postnup as a document, that's how people naturally think
[00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:33.040]   about it, it's agreement, it's just a document.
[00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:37.000]   Don't think about it as a document, because the document may not be worth the paper it's
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:43.560]   written on, if not done properly, think of it as a process, make sure that you are meeting
[00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:54.000]   every step of the process, and I'll talk about some particular steps in a moment.
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:52:02.560]   So if you have a prenuptial agreement, I advise clients to begin the process four to six months
[00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:08.360]   prior to the wedding, and the reason that I say this is a lot of prenups or postnups
[00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:15.480]   get thrown out because a court finds that it was negotiated and/or executed way too
[00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:24.320]   close to the wedding, and that leads to the idea that it was signed under duress or without
[00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:31.600]   fully understanding each of your rights, and so if you are at the point where you realize
[00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:36.160]   that you do need a prenup or postnup, but you're getting close to the wedding, one thing
[00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:40.840]   that I tell clients all the time is that a postnuptial agreement may be a much better
[00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:47.720]   idea and may be much more binding than going through with a prenup, because a lot of times
[00:52:47.720 --> 00:52:53.480]   people feel in a rush, they're like, "Oh, I need to get this done before the marriage,"
[00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:57.840]   you don't need to get it done before the marriage, you can wait, and in fact, it may be more
[00:52:57.840 --> 00:53:00.200]   binding if you do it.
[00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:05.920]   So let's talk just for a moment, well, what if you don't wait?
[00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:08.260]   And what if it is too close to the wedding?
[00:53:08.260 --> 00:53:13.160]   Is there something that you do afterwards to then make it binding?
[00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:18.440]   And yeah, there is something that you can do, again, it's jurisdiction dependent, but
[00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:25.720]   I think in many jurisdictions, what you can do is sign something known as a reaffirmation
[00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:29.960]   after the wedding is over, after the honeymoon is over, after you've had a little time to
[00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:35.200]   think, and the reaffirmation generally says something like, "We've now had sufficient
[00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:41.760]   amount of time to think it through, and we reaffirm that we want to be bound by all of
[00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:49.880]   the terms of the prenuptial agreement," and generally that should be done using the same
[00:53:49.880 --> 00:53:55.080]   thing to, the same way to execute that would be the same way that you executed a prenup
[00:53:55.080 --> 00:54:02.480]   or postnup, and we'll talk about how a prenup or postnup should be executed, at least in
[00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:03.480]   many jurisdictions.
[00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:05.920]   So, Alan, I see your hands up.
[00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:07.960]   Yeah, sorry to interrupt again.
[00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:13.120]   If somebody is in fact signing a prenup, yeah, somebody in a couple decides they do want
[00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:17.040]   to proceed with the prenup, but it's close to the time of the wedding, is there any utility
[00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:23.480]   in having it assigned with a video affirmation at that time, showing that they are not, neither
[00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:25.500]   party is acting under duress?
[00:54:25.500 --> 00:54:32.480]   I saw that suggested in an actual Boglehead's thread that's currently active.
[00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:40.880]   So, you are just a few points ahead of me, and so I will, I promise you I will address
[00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:41.880]   that, Alan.
[00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:44.000]   Great, great question.
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:53.520]   So just one other thing on, actually there's a few different points here, gives both spouses
[00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:56.040]   a reason to want it to be binding.
[00:54:56.040 --> 00:55:05.400]   Again, if there's a situation where one spouse is insistent on no alimony, is insistent on
[00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:11.440]   separate all, and especially if they're the higher earning spouse, of wanting everything
[00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:17.220]   that is earned during the marriage to be their separate property, to have essentially almost
[00:55:17.220 --> 00:55:23.920]   all the assets be their own separate assets, then that causes a few different problems.
[00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:31.680]   Number one, a court may find that it is unenforceable, especially if it goes against the public policy
[00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:36.040]   of your particular state, and let me give you an example in the state of Florida, it
[00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:41.320]   would be against the public policy if due to a prenuptial agreement, one spouse were
[00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:46.200]   to end up with all of the assets and with all of the income, and the other spouse were
[00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:50.320]   to end up on government assistance or welfare.
[00:55:50.320 --> 00:55:57.240]   The courts would essentially throw out the prenuptial agreement, and they would say,
[00:55:57.240 --> 00:56:02.240]   all right, it's better that you pay rather than the state pay and order alimony even
[00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:03.240]   though it was waived.
[00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:11.120]   So that's one thing, but another thing as well, a practical point is you want to give
[00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:16.920]   your spouse a reason not to fight it in the event that it needs to be enforced in the
[00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:17.920]   future.
[00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:25.880]   And so a tip for how to make that happen is to provide for some amount of immediate payout
[00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:33.920]   of lump sum alimony, or for some immediate division of property that goes to them.
[00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:41.600]   And once that is done, in many states, that will basically be seen as an acceptance of
[00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:46.720]   the terms of the agreement, another reaffirmation of the terms of the agreement, and prevent
[00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:50.000]   them from later on trying to get it thrown out.
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:57.560]   So you want to give your fiance or spouse a reason for it to be binding.
[00:56:57.560 --> 00:57:00.440]   Don't let it be a totally one-sided agreement.
[00:57:00.440 --> 00:57:04.960]   I also think that's just a terrible way to start a marriage if it's completely one-sided.
[00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:11.960]   Similarly, don't expect a take it or leave it agreement.
[00:57:11.960 --> 00:57:18.520]   In fact, when I'm reviewing agreements for a client that their spouse's attorney has
[00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:22.960]   received, has provided them agreement, or their fiance's attorney has provided with
[00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:28.400]   them agreement, the first thing I tell them is these agreements are rarely, if ever, take
[00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:34.400]   it or leave it, and your attorney probably told your fiance to expect some suggested
[00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:36.840]   changes.
[00:57:36.840 --> 00:57:42.480]   And I don't want you to be afraid if you receive a prenuptial agreement to say, to think to
[00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:44.800]   yourself, "Well, it's in writing, so I have to sign it."
[00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:47.000]   You don't have to sign it as is.
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:48.720]   It can be negotiated.
[00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:50.120]   In fact, it should be negotiated.
[00:57:50.120 --> 00:57:55.760]   In fact, the spouse who wants it done in the first place should want it to be negotiated
[00:57:55.760 --> 00:58:02.120]   because if it's negotiated, it shows that it was less likely to have been done by duress.
[00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:08.880]   And so it makes it less likely to be thrown out.
[00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:14.520]   Another way to make it binding is to hire a separate lawyer for each fiance or each
[00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:16.720]   spouse.
[00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:24.800]   I know there are jurisdictions that may allow one attorney to write a prenuptial or post-nuptial
[00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:25.800]   agreement for both spouses.
[00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:28.360]   I just don't think that's a great idea.
[00:58:28.360 --> 00:58:34.120]   In fact, there are states, including my own state of Florida, which say that that is strictly
[00:58:34.120 --> 00:58:38.080]   prohibited for one attorney to do that.
[00:58:38.080 --> 00:58:44.280]   And the reasoning behind that is because they want to make sure that each spouse gets independent
[00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:52.480]   legal advice and make sure that each spouse or fiance's interests are being independently
[00:58:52.480 --> 00:58:55.880]   looked after and represented.
[00:58:55.880 --> 00:59:01.080]   And you just can't do that with one single lawyer.
[00:59:01.080 --> 00:59:02.980]   But here's also one thing as well.
[00:59:02.980 --> 00:59:09.480]   You may have a lawyer who is used to doing wills, trusts, and other estate planning,
[00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:14.360]   and you may be used to doing documents with them together.
[00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:18.080]   And so there are many estate planning lawyers who will do wills for both spouses or do a
[00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:20.240]   trust for both spouses.
[00:59:20.240 --> 00:59:24.080]   And that's great, and that works for those types of documents.
[00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:31.120]   But then sometimes the client will ask that same lawyer to then do a prenup or post-nup,
[00:59:31.120 --> 00:59:38.300]   which as we've seen, does have some touches on estate planning, on inheritance planning.
[00:59:38.300 --> 00:59:46.820]   But especially if it's an attorney who doesn't know what they're doing and says yes, if it's
[00:59:46.820 --> 00:59:51.320]   one attorney who's doing that for both spouses, depending on your jurisdiction, it just may
[00:59:51.320 --> 00:59:58.740]   de facto be thrown out without question if one attorney tried to do it for both.
[00:59:58.740 --> 01:00:05.640]   So it's just something to keep in mind.
[01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:11.340]   So you must have full financial disclosure in most jurisdictions for it to be binding.
[01:00:11.340 --> 01:00:18.220]   So that generally means you must totally disclose your income, your expenses, your assets, and
[01:00:18.220 --> 01:00:19.360]   your debts.
[01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:25.820]   And you also generally must disclose, again, depending on your jurisdiction, major financial
[01:00:25.820 --> 01:00:35.280]   documents like tax returns, pay stubs, statements for brokerage accounts, 401(k)s, HSAs, IRAs.
[01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:37.260]   Pretty much all of it.
[01:00:37.260 --> 01:00:41.860]   And so it is a total pain in the ass to go through all of that financial disclosure.
[01:00:41.860 --> 01:00:47.460]   I will admit that up front, but again, what I generally suggest is that it can be used
[01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:52.300]   as an opportunity to open up the conversation, to get to know each other's finances and to
[01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:55.780]   talk about how you want to plan for each other.
[01:00:55.780 --> 01:01:02.540]   And something else as well, this may not apply to Bobo Heads as much, but if you are dependent
[01:01:02.540 --> 01:01:08.420]   on a financial advisor, for example, then one good thing about having a financial advisor
[01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:12.900]   is that they may be able to disclose or provide a lot of those documents so that you don't
[01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:13.900]   have to.
[01:01:13.900 --> 01:01:17.700]   Separately, some people are more dependent on a CPA, especially if you've got a private
[01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:18.800]   business.
[01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:23.180]   So your attorney may be able to communicate with that CPA and just get a bunch of the
[01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:30.860]   documents from them to lessen the stress on you as you're trying to put all of this together.
[01:01:30.860 --> 01:01:41.420]   There's something else, again, I very much believe in a collaborative process and specifically
[01:01:41.420 --> 01:01:43.860]   an interdisciplinary collaborative process.
[01:01:43.860 --> 01:01:50.060]   And that means using experts, not just from the legal field, but also from other fields
[01:01:50.060 --> 01:01:51.380]   that may be helpful.
[01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:55.820]   And when doing a prenup or postnup, it actually is helpful to have somebody who has a financial
[01:01:55.820 --> 01:01:58.780]   background or a mental health background.
[01:01:58.780 --> 01:02:04.860]   So in this interdisciplinary collaborative team approach to prenups and postnups, each
[01:02:04.860 --> 01:02:10.900]   spouse has their own separate collaborative lawyer who can't be hired to litigate in the
[01:02:10.900 --> 01:02:13.180]   future in case something happens to each other.
[01:02:13.180 --> 01:02:18.260]   So they don't have an incentive to put all these things in play in the hopes that in
[01:02:18.260 --> 01:02:22.140]   the future, they're going to create a lot of issues, a lot of problems for the clients
[01:02:22.140 --> 01:02:27.860]   then be able to make a lot of money in trial work later on.
[01:02:27.860 --> 01:02:35.020]   So there's that, there's oftentimes the use of a financial neutral for financial education
[01:02:35.020 --> 01:02:38.980]   and to ensure and document financial disclosure.
[01:02:38.980 --> 01:02:49.380]   Financial neutral is usually a collaboratively trained CPA or sometimes a financial advisor.
[01:02:49.380 --> 01:02:56.980]   And again, their purpose is to help level the playing field in many relationships, both
[01:02:56.980 --> 01:02:59.060]   before marriage and during a marriage.
[01:02:59.060 --> 01:03:06.180]   There's oftentimes a big gap between the understanding of finances from one spouse to the other.
[01:03:06.180 --> 01:03:12.220]   So this person can help level the playing field and also help to make your agreement
[01:03:12.220 --> 01:03:17.420]   more enforceable because they can document all of the financial disclosure and they can
[01:03:17.420 --> 01:03:22.380]   document all of the financial education and show that both were actively participating
[01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:27.340]   in the prenuptial or post-nuptial drafting process.
[01:03:27.340 --> 01:03:33.620]   And finally, like this, the use of a neutral facilitator.
[01:03:33.620 --> 01:03:36.300]   And in your jurisdiction, it's called different things.
[01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:41.140]   It's sometimes called the collaborative coach or neutral mental health professional.
[01:03:41.140 --> 01:03:45.020]   It's somebody who is a licensed mental health professional, although they're not actually
[01:03:45.020 --> 01:03:47.900]   doing therapy as part of the process.
[01:03:47.900 --> 01:03:53.980]   They're there to help ensure that both fiancees or spouses voices are heard during the prenuptial
[01:03:53.980 --> 01:03:56.060]   and post-nuptial process.
[01:03:56.060 --> 01:04:02.300]   And from an enforcement perspective, they can help document that there was no duress
[01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:05.740]   as part of it and both people were actively participating.
[01:04:05.740 --> 01:04:15.100]   I do see JC has a question in the chat.
[01:04:15.100 --> 01:04:18.020]   How much do these sorts of collaborative processes cost?
[01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:19.020]   All right.
[01:04:19.020 --> 01:04:21.620]   Again, everybody can now repeat it with me.
[01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:23.300]   Use the lawyer answer.
[01:04:23.300 --> 01:04:24.300]   It depends.
[01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:25.300]   Yep.
[01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:26.300]   That's right.
[01:04:26.300 --> 01:04:27.300]   It depends.
[01:04:27.300 --> 01:04:30.860]   It depends very widely where you are.
[01:04:30.860 --> 01:04:38.420]   It's going to be a lot more expensive to do this in a higher cost of living area than
[01:04:38.420 --> 01:04:46.060]   a lower cost of living area because lawyers tend to charge a lot more in those higher
[01:04:46.060 --> 01:04:50.260]   costs and opposite on those lower costs.
[01:04:50.260 --> 01:04:53.740]   So it really just depends.
[01:04:53.740 --> 01:04:59.700]   I can say that it probably will cost you a bit more than having the lawyers do it up
[01:04:59.700 --> 01:05:06.020]   front and just having lawyers do it because you are paying not just for the lawyers, but
[01:05:06.020 --> 01:05:13.420]   for the financial neutrals involvement and the neutral facilitators involvement as well.
[01:05:13.420 --> 01:05:19.900]   So it could cost more up front, but it could save you a whole lot of money down the line
[01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:22.240]   and it could save your marriage as well.
[01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:25.700]   So just something to keep in mind.
[01:05:25.700 --> 01:05:26.700]   Allen.
[01:05:26.700 --> 01:05:27.700]   Yes.
[01:05:27.700 --> 01:05:35.980]   Are you inferring that most collaborative lawyers doing prenups will advocate for the
[01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:43.700]   use of a financial neutral and a facilitator versus just a couple of lawyers basically
[01:05:43.700 --> 01:05:48.700]   representing each of the potential clients or spouses?
[01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:50.020]   Yeah.
[01:05:50.020 --> 01:05:51.260]   Great question.
[01:05:51.260 --> 01:05:56.780]   So typically they will maybe not advocate, but provide the option or maybe depending
[01:05:56.780 --> 01:06:06.380]   on the circumstances, they may advocate strongly, especially if there are a lot of assets and
[01:06:06.380 --> 01:06:13.940]   there's a very clear gap in knowledge or some other issues as well.
[01:06:13.940 --> 01:06:19.140]   Or it may be that it's done not in an interdisciplinary collaborative team, but just through the
[01:06:19.140 --> 01:06:20.140]   collaborative lawyer.
[01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:21.700]   So that's an option as well.
[01:06:21.700 --> 01:06:31.060]   I do it both ways, but I do make sure to provide those options and some take me up on it.
[01:06:31.060 --> 01:06:41.820]   Some don't, but especially when it's a lot of money that we're dealing with.
[01:06:41.820 --> 01:06:50.260]   And so a lot of protections and also big gaps in education, I then really highly recommend
[01:06:50.260 --> 01:06:51.260]   it.
[01:06:51.260 --> 01:06:52.260]   Especially it's up to the clients.
[01:06:52.260 --> 01:06:53.260]   Yeah.
[01:06:53.260 --> 01:06:58.100]   I would think in some cases the collaborative approach might be cheaper because it's not
[01:06:58.100 --> 01:07:05.140]   basically confrontational that you might have more of a straightforward give and take, whereas
[01:07:05.140 --> 01:07:10.020]   if you have two typical lawyers who are very confrontational in their style, they could
[01:07:10.020 --> 01:07:17.540]   drive the cost up in the time spent negotiating back and forth ad nauseum.
[01:07:17.540 --> 01:07:19.060]   You are absolutely correct.
[01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:24.180]   And actually I'm going to touch on that a little bit more in just a moment, talking
[01:07:24.180 --> 01:07:26.060]   about the process.
[01:07:26.060 --> 01:07:27.900]   But that's absolutely correct.
[01:07:27.900 --> 01:07:34.860]   And I'll do a little bit of a comparison in a collaborative approach as compared to maybe
[01:07:34.860 --> 01:07:40.260]   the traditional approach to pre-nuptial and post-nuptial agreements.
[01:07:40.260 --> 01:07:45.860]   And then actually, Alan, to something that you said earlier, one of the things that we
[01:07:45.860 --> 01:07:52.620]   strongly recommend to help it be more likely to be binding is to have a signing meeting
[01:07:52.620 --> 01:07:56.700]   in person or possibly via video conferencing.
[01:07:56.700 --> 01:07:57.940]   It really depends on your state.
[01:07:57.940 --> 01:08:02.660]   Some states allow it to be done by video conferencing.
[01:08:02.660 --> 01:08:08.700]   Some states would require a wet signature or physical signature with ink.
[01:08:08.700 --> 01:08:13.260]   But either way, I would suggest that it be recorded.
[01:08:13.260 --> 01:08:18.420]   Some lawyers go far as saying it should not only be recorded, but it also should be transcribed
[01:08:18.420 --> 01:08:22.740]   by a court reporter.
[01:08:22.740 --> 01:08:31.100]   I think that may be a little bit overkill, so long as it's being recorded by video.
[01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:35.700]   And during this, it's not just a recording of the signing.
[01:08:35.700 --> 01:08:41.560]   There's usually some things that happen beforehand.
[01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:48.100]   So typically, we'll have a notary or somebody else who is able to put the clients under
[01:08:48.100 --> 01:08:50.220]   oath, put them under oath.
[01:08:50.220 --> 01:08:55.300]   And a lot of times, it'll sound just like you hear on Judge Judy or the People's Court.
[01:08:55.300 --> 01:08:58.140]   You swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.
[01:08:58.140 --> 01:09:05.580]   And depending on your jurisdiction, so help you God.
[01:09:05.580 --> 01:09:11.760]   And then there will oftentimes be some questions asked of the clients.
[01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:17.040]   And if you've got a good lawyer, they'll prepare you ahead of time for all these questions.
[01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:22.440]   But there'll be things like, first off, have you read the agreement?
[01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:24.400]   Okay, good.
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:26.820]   Do you understand the agreement?
[01:09:26.820 --> 01:09:30.680]   Have you had the opportunity to review the agreement with your lawyer?
[01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:34.680]   Have all of your questions been answered on the agreement?
[01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:38.840]   And oh, by the way, did you have anything to drink this morning?
[01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:43.360]   Did you have anything or do anything which would impair your judgment or impair your
[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:48.600]   ability to enter into a legally enforceable agreement?
[01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:52.240]   And so all of that goes towards in the future.
[01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:55.800]   If there are any of these questions, are you entering, are you signing this agreement freely
[01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:58.880]   and voluntarily with the intent to be bound by it?
[01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:02.360]   All of these questions go towards the binding nature.
[01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:09.200]   So going back, Alan, to the question that you asked earlier, what if it's like really
[01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:16.640]   close to the wedding and you didn't start the four to six months, but you had it, you
[01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:20.520]   know, recorded it and you had all these questions answered?
[01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:30.600]   I would still, even if you did that, I would still recommend to my clients to get a reaffirmation
[01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:36.880]   afterwards after the wedding, after, you know, after time has gone by and after they've had
[01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:43.760]   time to reflect on it, after the craziness of the wedding is over with, to just reaffirm
[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:50.920]   that they still want to be bound by that prenuptial agreement, just to be safe.
[01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:55.320]   It may be binding, but if people are going through the trouble of getting it done and
[01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:58.440]   through the expense of getting it done, you really want to make sure it's binding.
[01:10:58.440 --> 01:11:12.080]   A few, a few other suggestions, place the fully executed agreement, financial disclosure
[01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:20.600]   and the recording of the signing meeting in a safety deposit box or other safe place.
[01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:27.520]   Just in case you need it in the future, you know, a lot of people don't do this and then
[01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:33.960]   they hope that their attorney keeps a copy and most attorneys will keep a copy, but things
[01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:34.960]   happened.
[01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:40.760]   You know, before this recording, we were talking about hurricanes, you know, there are some
[01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:46.200]   people who are affected by the wildfires out in California.
[01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:54.240]   There may be old agreements that got destroyed because of natural disasters or, you know,
[01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:59.120]   even if they're done electronically, glitches happen to systems.
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:05.760]   So I would make sure to keep a printed copy, digital copy, all of your financial disclosure,
[01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:10.920]   all of your recordings and put it in a safety deposit box or something someplace else that's
[01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:19.400]   really safe and someplace where you can access it in case you ever needed it.
[01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:25.840]   Something else I like to do in pre-nups and post-nups is include a clause for periodically
[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:35.020]   reviewing it, periodically revisiting the agreement to see if changes are needed.
[01:12:35.020 --> 01:12:41.920]   Circumstances change and it may be that what you thought was important before the marriage
[01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:46.840]   turns out 10 years later is not so important, or maybe that you've got a different view
[01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:48.680]   on how you want to do things.
[01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:53.880]   So I'll oftentimes put a clause that if one of the spouses wants, you know, and sometimes
[01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:59.680]   it's, there's a time, you know, every five years or every 10 years, sometimes it's, you
[01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:04.560]   know, some sort of incident that happens.
[01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:10.800]   So, you know, once a child is born or once a wedding happens or, you know, any different
[01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:15.800]   things you may want to revisit it and see if your priorities are the same as when the
[01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:20.200]   agreement was initially signed.
[01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:31.840]   In addition, if you move to a different jurisdiction, if you're in one of those jurisdictions that
[01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:37.840]   we discussed before have signed a version of the UPAA, the Uniform Premarital Agreement
[01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:43.600]   Act, then in all likelihood that agreement will be honored.
[01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:49.740]   If you're not in one of those jurisdictions, it may or may not be honored.
[01:13:49.740 --> 01:13:58.600]   But either way, regardless of your, regardless if you move to another UPAA jurisdiction,
[01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:03.120]   I would still have it reviewed by a local lawyer because even if it's honored, it may
[01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:09.100]   be interpreted very differently than you both had intended and very differently than how
[01:14:09.100 --> 01:14:16.920]   the lawyers explained under the law of the state where you initially signed it and had
[01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:17.920]   it developed.
[01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:26.620]   Now, in my agreements, I typically put in there that the agreement was signed in Florida,
[01:14:26.620 --> 01:14:32.100]   that in the event of any issue in the future, that it will be legally binding and it will
[01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:38.620]   be interpreted regardless of where the clients live by the laws and by the interpretation
[01:14:38.620 --> 01:14:41.060]   of the state of Florida.
[01:14:41.060 --> 01:14:45.180]   The only challenge with something like that is that if you go to some place and ultimately
[01:14:45.180 --> 01:14:50.740]   you need it, you need to enforce it in a different state, they may not know what that means or
[01:14:50.740 --> 01:14:53.060]   they may not know how to interpret it.
[01:14:53.060 --> 01:14:57.180]   So one of a few things will happen, either they totally ignore it and they just interpret
[01:14:57.180 --> 01:15:06.220]   it by whatever the state that you're in, which may or may not be appealable error in your
[01:15:06.220 --> 01:15:16.380]   jurisdiction, or they, you know, alternatively, you can bring in an expert, somebody from
[01:15:16.380 --> 01:15:20.620]   Florida who knows how it would be interpreted in Florida, but that could create an additional
[01:15:20.620 --> 01:15:22.580]   expense later down the line.
[01:15:22.580 --> 01:15:27.300]   So you may decide that you want to just review it with a local lawyer and see if there are
[01:15:27.300 --> 01:15:32.340]   any changes that need to be made for that new jurisdiction.
[01:15:32.340 --> 01:15:44.460]   Okay, so now we go to the next, and this is heading towards the final agenda item of the
[01:15:44.460 --> 01:15:45.460]   process.
[01:15:45.460 --> 01:15:50.340]   Can the prenup or post-snuff process suck a little less?
[01:15:50.340 --> 01:15:52.900]   And I hope to tell you, yes, it can.
[01:15:52.900 --> 01:15:56.500]   Again, there are going to be challenging conversations.
[01:15:56.500 --> 01:16:01.900]   So I don't want to make, even if I use terms like collaborative, collaborative doesn't
[01:16:01.900 --> 01:16:03.580]   mean easy.
[01:16:03.580 --> 01:16:05.240]   Collaborative doesn't mean wonderful.
[01:16:05.240 --> 01:16:13.140]   It just is a different method of going about things where your professionals especially
[01:16:13.140 --> 01:16:19.260]   have a very different attitude than what traditional family law professionals may have in different
[01:16:19.260 --> 01:16:21.080]   training as well.
[01:16:21.080 --> 01:16:29.940]   So kind of going to what Alan was saying, here's one suggestion.
[01:16:29.940 --> 01:16:35.860]   Don't hire divorce trial lawyers to draft your prenuptial agreement.
[01:16:35.860 --> 01:16:42.580]   Hire collaborative family lawyers, and this is for a very simple, practical reason.
[01:16:42.580 --> 01:16:48.460]   Trial lawyers are used to working within an adversarial system, and again, as we were
[01:16:48.460 --> 01:16:56.260]   discussing before, it is a system that by its very nature, by its very design pits parent
[01:16:56.260 --> 01:16:59.420]   versus parent, spouse versus spouse.
[01:16:59.420 --> 01:17:04.900]   This is what the trial lawyers are used to working in, and by the way, it's well-intended.
[01:17:04.900 --> 01:17:08.540]   It's not like these are bad books.
[01:17:08.540 --> 01:17:13.980]   There's actually a reason why it's an adversarial system, and it goes way back into ancient
[01:17:13.980 --> 01:17:14.980]   history.
[01:17:14.980 --> 01:17:20.420]   The idea that in order to find the truth of something, you needed to hear all different
[01:17:20.420 --> 01:17:26.780]   perspectives, and so you'd hear, if you hear the husband's perspective, then you hear the
[01:17:26.780 --> 01:17:31.060]   wife's perspective, well, then you'll come to the ultimate truth, and the idea behind
[01:17:31.060 --> 01:17:33.900]   that is the judge will come to the ultimate truth.
[01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:40.140]   But how it's done in practice is oftentimes it's, all right, let me tell you why I'm right.
[01:17:40.140 --> 01:17:45.420]   For example, let me tell you why I'm the most wonderful father in the world, and why there
[01:17:45.420 --> 01:17:50.980]   should be no alimony, and let me also tell you why they're the worst possible parent
[01:17:50.980 --> 01:17:56.900]   in the world, and why even if they had alimony, they would frivolously spend it because that's
[01:17:56.900 --> 01:17:58.500]   the type of person they are.
[01:17:58.500 --> 01:18:07.700]   So that's kind of the adversarial nature of trial work and of the type of system within
[01:18:07.700 --> 01:18:11.380]   which trial lawyers are used to working.
[01:18:11.380 --> 01:18:15.800]   In contrast, collaborative family lawyers are used to helping people reach agreements
[01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:19.220]   without the threat of trial.
[01:18:19.220 --> 01:18:25.500]   In fact, once what's known as a collaborative participation agreement is signed, those collaborative
[01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:31.820]   family lawyers are prohibited, depending on your state, either by law or by contract,
[01:18:31.820 --> 01:18:37.880]   from ever engaging again in any type of trial work involving the client.
[01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:43.700]   So their incentive is to help the clients reach an agreement, because in the divorce
[01:18:43.700 --> 01:18:49.580]   process, if they don't reach an agreement, and one of the spouses decide to then go to
[01:18:49.580 --> 01:18:53.380]   trial, then both of the collaborative lawyers are fired.
[01:18:53.380 --> 01:18:57.260]   And yeah, we may be lawyers, but we're also people, and we don't like to be fired.
[01:18:57.260 --> 01:19:01.660]   So we're used to helping people reach agreements without the threat of trial.
[01:19:01.660 --> 01:19:12.100]   So I used to be a member of the board of the International Academy of Collaborative Professionals.
[01:19:12.100 --> 01:19:15.980]   There's pretty much, there are collaborative lawyers in pretty much all jurisdictions.
[01:19:15.980 --> 01:19:22.100]   You can find a collaborative lawyer near you by going to collaborativepractice.com, which
[01:19:22.100 --> 01:19:26.220]   is the website of the International Academy of Collaborative Professionals.
[01:19:26.220 --> 01:19:33.300]   And similarly, within the collaborative method, this will oftentimes work with an interdisciplinary
[01:19:33.300 --> 01:19:34.300]   team.
[01:19:34.300 --> 01:19:40.300]   And let me tell you, when you bring on a mental health professional to deal with these tough
[01:19:40.300 --> 01:19:45.020]   conversations, this is true in divorce, but this is also very true when dealing with those
[01:19:45.020 --> 01:19:49.300]   challenging financial conversations with prenups or post-nups.
[01:19:49.300 --> 01:19:58.300]   It makes the process so much more palatable, I would even say so much easier to go through
[01:19:58.300 --> 01:20:04.860]   from the client perspective, I have to say from the lawyer perspective as well.
[01:20:04.860 --> 01:20:11.940]   And as Alan was alluding to, it also makes it a lot less likely that there's going to
[01:20:11.940 --> 01:20:17.980]   be so much back and forth and so much fighting, and that can actually save you some money
[01:20:17.980 --> 01:20:20.500]   and also save you some frustration.
[01:20:20.500 --> 01:20:25.020]   But these agreements, rather than being done the traditional way, which is one person writes
[01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:30.140]   up a prenuptial agreement oftentimes that is so one-sided and then sends it to the other
[01:20:30.140 --> 01:20:34.020]   person, their attorney, and their attorney then creates a whole bunch of red lines, which
[01:20:34.020 --> 01:20:38.380]   then may be one-sided to the other spouse, and they keep on going back and forth, and
[01:20:38.380 --> 01:20:41.300]   that can be quite an expense.
[01:20:41.300 --> 01:20:46.460]   This process oftentimes, it's done through a series of meetings so the clients can have
[01:20:46.460 --> 01:20:50.740]   open discussions about what exactly it is they're looking to do, and both of their voices
[01:20:50.740 --> 01:20:54.060]   can be heard.
[01:20:54.060 --> 01:21:02.300]   And so, again, I just personally think it's a better process.
[01:21:02.300 --> 01:21:04.860]   Just a few other items.
[01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:09.180]   Focus on interests rather than positions.
[01:21:09.180 --> 01:21:10.580]   Listen to your fiance's spouse's concerns.
[01:21:10.580 --> 01:21:15.340]   And by the way, this is coming right out of the Harvard Negotiation Playbook.
[01:21:15.340 --> 01:21:23.820]   You may have heard of Getting to Yes, and the difference between interests and positions.
[01:21:23.820 --> 01:21:28.500]   Very briefly, positions are what you're looking for.
[01:21:28.500 --> 01:21:33.140]   Positions are why you're looking for those things.
[01:21:33.140 --> 01:21:40.860]   So if you have a fiance that says, "Look, if something happens, I just want $10,000
[01:21:40.860 --> 01:21:45.300]   a month in alimony," that's a position.
[01:21:45.300 --> 01:21:51.700]   And if I have a client who's saying that, and the other client is saying, "Well, I don't
[01:21:51.700 --> 01:21:58.440]   want to have to pay any alimony whatsoever," well, it's very possible that you're going
[01:21:58.440 --> 01:22:04.040]   to reach an impasse and this is going to blow up your marriage.
[01:22:04.040 --> 01:22:10.940]   And so rather than focus on those positions, we highly suggest that you focus on interests.
[01:22:10.940 --> 01:22:16.700]   And so how we do that is ask the question with curiosity, "Why?"
[01:22:16.700 --> 01:22:23.900]   So if I have a client who says, "Well, I need $10,000 in alimony per month," then the question
[01:22:23.900 --> 01:22:33.940]   may be, "Why?" and the answer may be, "Well, because that's what I spent," and then the
[01:22:33.940 --> 01:22:36.820]   question may be, "Why on that?"
[01:22:36.820 --> 01:22:41.740]   And just kind of digging further and further, what you may soon realize is it's not that
[01:22:41.740 --> 01:22:47.720]   particular amount that they're looking for, but it's some financial security that they're
[01:22:47.720 --> 01:22:52.540]   afraid that if something should happen, they're not going to be able to pay their bills.
[01:22:52.540 --> 01:22:57.960]   So once you know that, then you open up the possibility of options that you can then explore
[01:22:57.960 --> 01:23:03.060]   that go beyond just no alimony or the $10,000 a month in alimony.
[01:23:03.060 --> 01:23:08.360]   As I said before, I gave an example of what might be an option in that scenario, which
[01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:14.540]   may be, well, as financial security, it may be that you have a life insurance policy,
[01:23:14.540 --> 01:23:22.560]   or it may be that you have a disability policy, or it may be that you have the other person
[01:23:22.560 --> 01:23:29.840]   pay for a separate brokerage account or HSA or Roth IRA or other type of account for you,
[01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:33.580]   or maybe a certain alimony combined with one of these ideas.
[01:23:33.580 --> 01:23:38.760]   So it just opens up some options.
[01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:46.240]   And again, rather than thinking of it as a terrible process, I hope that I've kind of
[01:23:46.240 --> 01:23:54.640]   shown that it can be used as an opportunity to have those challenging but necessary conversations
[01:23:54.640 --> 01:24:01.620]   to head off future problems, to learn about each other's views on spending, saving, and
[01:24:01.620 --> 01:24:08.000]   investing, and to create a better future for your family.
[01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:15.440]   So let me just open up the floor and see if there are any questions.
[01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:24.840]   Thank you, Adam, for covering such a broad and difficult subject and really giving us
[01:24:24.840 --> 01:24:30.560]   a lot of insight into the positive aspects of approaching this difficult subject.
[01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:34.280]   It was fascinating.
[01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:40.340]   If people want to raise their hand, use the raised hand icon to ask a question on camera
[01:24:40.340 --> 01:24:44.840]   or submit a question via the chat.
[01:24:44.840 --> 01:24:53.080]   We'll take them in chronologic order.
[01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:54.840]   I have one to start, Adam.
[01:24:54.840 --> 01:25:01.800]   I'm curious, if you recommend, should parents, especially for those of us who are older,
[01:25:01.800 --> 01:25:06.320]   maybe in the pre or early retired life stage, the retired life stage with children getting
[01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:12.480]   married, is it appropriate for us to bring up the topic of a possible prenup to our adult
[01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:15.680]   children when they get engaged?
[01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:18.840]   Yeah, great question.
[01:25:18.840 --> 01:25:24.200]   So whether or not it is appropriate, it happens.
[01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:28.720]   It happens quite a bit.
[01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:35.980]   And so I think a lot of folks do come to us because a parent says something.
[01:25:35.980 --> 01:25:41.080]   And so it's not really for me to judge whether or not it is appropriate because everybody
[01:25:41.080 --> 01:25:44.400]   has different family dynamics.
[01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:52.440]   And so there may be a problem in a particular family where it's totally natural.
[01:25:52.440 --> 01:26:02.840]   Or look, and there are parents out there who just have a true concern about their child
[01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:04.680]   and want to bring it up.
[01:26:04.680 --> 01:26:09.600]   Or there may be a family business or something where it makes sense to bring it up.
[01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:15.920]   So whether or not it's appropriate, Alan, it happens.
[01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:20.120]   And so sometimes it's a good thing.
[01:26:20.120 --> 01:26:26.520]   And in fact, there are times where I will have a parent with an adult child who's coming
[01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:29.880]   to me in the first place just because the parent wants to know kind of what's going
[01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:33.120]   to happen and how it's going to work.
[01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:40.000]   And if the adult child is okay with that, then I'm okay with that.
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.240]   Just so that all questions can be answered.
[01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:46.800]   And quite frankly, a lot of the times, especially if we're talking about younger adult children,
[01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:49.400]   they just don't know what questions to ask.
[01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:53.420]   And they may find comfort in their parent being there who's had a little bit more life
[01:26:53.420 --> 01:26:59.260]   experience to be able to ask, especially those questions which the child may feel challenging
[01:26:59.260 --> 01:27:00.260]   even to articulate.
[01:27:00.260 --> 01:27:09.000]   Sarah, I do see that your hand is up and then we'll go back, Alan, to some additional questions.
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:15.320]   So Sarah, if you want to unmute yourself, I'd love to hear your question.
[01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:20.160]   Sarah, you're still muted?
[01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:21.160]   Sorry about that.
[01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:26.120]   It's only been five years since the pandemic, I'm still getting used to the computer.
[01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:32.160]   So I wondered, first of all, thanks so much, it was a terrific, terrific presentation and
[01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:37.480]   grateful to you, Alan, too, for hosting this.
[01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:41.960]   My question is, in your experience, Adam, are there different sets of advice that you
[01:27:41.960 --> 01:27:47.960]   give for widows and widowers in this process here?
[01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:55.640]   And I say that just because I'm not looking to get married anytime soon, but I have experienced
[01:27:55.640 --> 01:28:03.160]   just that vulnerability and I've had kind of a predatory situation that fortunately
[01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:08.680]   worked out OK, but there's a vulnerability that I think widows and widowers have that
[01:28:08.680 --> 01:28:10.060]   maybe GenPOP doesn't.
[01:28:10.060 --> 01:28:13.400]   And I wonder if you calibrate your advice differently.
[01:28:13.400 --> 01:28:21.120]   So I think that's a great question, and thank you, by the way, for being so open to sharing.
[01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:27.680]   I mean, that's because hopefully other folks can learn a little bit from that.
[01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:35.080]   And what I would say is that in some ways, I'll give the attorney answer, it depends.
[01:28:35.080 --> 01:28:43.880]   But some of the different factors that I would look at is, was there a significant inheritance
[01:28:43.880 --> 01:28:45.640]   that was received?
[01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:52.440]   And is there a desire to keep that inheritance separate not only for the widow or widower
[01:28:52.440 --> 01:28:59.920]   themselves, but also for any children that might be there if children were in there.
[01:28:59.920 --> 01:29:09.760]   So in that case, I might suggest that they have a prenup or postnup, if nothing else,
[01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:12.300]   make sure that that is protected.
[01:29:12.300 --> 01:29:20.220]   But also what I might suggest in any situation, especially if there has been a history or
[01:29:20.220 --> 01:29:25.440]   just out of curiosity, it's worth going and paying for a consultation with an attorney
[01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:32.920]   just to know about the laws in your particular state, to learn a bit about, you know, I was
[01:29:32.920 --> 01:29:38.760]   talking about really from my experience, though it might be broadly applicable, you know,
[01:29:38.760 --> 01:29:45.040]   I really only know Florida's laws, and I can, you know, I discuss with clients and answer
[01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:52.060]   particular questions for them, if they, you know, if they come and we have a consultation
[01:29:52.060 --> 01:29:57.360]   and answer their questions, and they may ultimately decide, and in fact, I may even tell them,
[01:29:57.360 --> 01:30:01.160]   hey, you really don't need a prenup given those circumstances, or postnup given those
[01:30:01.160 --> 01:30:05.960]   circumstances, but still, hopefully, it was helpful that you at least learned, you know,
[01:30:05.960 --> 01:30:09.200]   depending on what happens, what the law says.
[01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:10.200]   >> Gotcha.
[01:30:10.200 --> 01:30:11.200]   Great.
[01:30:11.200 --> 01:30:12.200]   Thank you so much.
[01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:13.200]   >> You bet.
[01:30:13.200 --> 01:30:14.200]   You bet.
[01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:15.200]   Thank you.
[01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:16.200]   >> Thank you.
[01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:17.200]   Great question.
[01:30:17.200 --> 01:30:18.200]   >> Thanks.
[01:30:18.200 --> 01:30:19.200]   >> Allen?
[01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:22.360]   >> Oh, actually, let me ask a question that had been submitted, pre-submitted from the
[01:30:22.360 --> 01:30:24.600]   Google form.
[01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:29.820]   Are there differences in how pre- and postnup arrangements should be approached between couples
[01:30:29.820 --> 01:30:34.040]   of similar versus disparate net worths?
[01:30:34.040 --> 01:30:38.360]   Is the approach different in that situation?
[01:30:38.360 --> 01:30:40.000]   >> Sure.
[01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:43.840]   So good question.
[01:30:43.840 --> 01:30:49.800]   I think it is, so there's a lot of different scenarios.
[01:30:49.800 --> 01:30:57.000]   I think the outcome may be different depending on the disparity, depending on who's asking
[01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:00.480]   for the prenup and why they're asking for a prenup.
[01:31:00.480 --> 01:31:09.240]   I'd say, you know, a lot of the times, it's because there is, because there's a private
[01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:18.000]   business, for example, and just if there's an issue, people want to make sure that the
[01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:23.400]   business isn't affected should something happen to the relationship, which could have a very
[01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:29.880]   big effect on personal finances or if there is a large inheritance.
[01:31:29.880 --> 01:31:36.800]   If, on the other hand, there's a situation where both people are pretty financially secure,
[01:31:36.800 --> 01:31:42.360]   but they're looking to do it, for example, in the situation where I had a couple, a client
[01:31:42.360 --> 01:31:48.280]   in their 70s, and they were financially secure, and the other spouse was also financially
[01:31:48.280 --> 01:31:53.400]   secure, that prenup or postnup is going to look very different than when, you know, only
[01:31:53.400 --> 01:31:57.100]   one spouse really is looking to protect inheritance or protecting a gift.
[01:31:57.100 --> 01:32:02.080]   So I think the approach, the outcome may be a bit different, but at the end of the day,
[01:32:02.080 --> 01:32:04.320]   you know, it all comes down to the question of why.
[01:32:04.320 --> 01:32:06.160]   Why are you looking to do this?
[01:32:06.160 --> 01:32:08.160]   What are you looking to protect?
[01:32:08.160 --> 01:32:10.880]   What are you hoping to happen as a result?
[01:32:10.880 --> 01:32:15.600]   And then develop something that meets their particular goals.
[01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:19.080]   All right.
[01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:24.240]   We have more questions, either via the raised hand or chat.
[01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:27.440]   Yes, JC.
[01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:39.000]   So my question is that I understand that question about, like, commingling, where if
[01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:47.040]   you have a separate account, but then you put in money that you earned during the marriage,
[01:32:47.040 --> 01:32:51.000]   like, into that account, like, if you continue to invest in your retirement account or your
[01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:57.600]   brokerage account with marital assets, your income during the marriage, it at least, unfortunately,
[01:32:57.600 --> 01:32:59.000]   becomes commingled.
[01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:00.360]   What about for debt?
[01:33:00.360 --> 01:33:08.200]   Like, if one partner has debt that was acquired prior to the marriage, if the other partner
[01:33:08.200 --> 01:33:17.280]   is using marital assets to help pay that down, does the rest of the debt become their responsibility
[01:33:17.280 --> 01:33:18.280]   as well?
[01:33:18.280 --> 01:33:19.280]   Yeah.
[01:33:19.280 --> 01:33:21.800]   So, great, great question.
[01:33:21.800 --> 01:33:28.880]   It probably would really depend on your state and the laws in your particular state.
[01:33:28.880 --> 01:33:36.160]   And in some states, it would be considered basically a gift to that person or a gift
[01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:37.160]   to the marriage.
[01:33:37.160 --> 01:33:42.080]   And just, you know, if debt gets paid down, well, in the event of divorce, then that debt
[01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:47.700]   is no longer there, nobody gets any credit, and it's just dealt with.
[01:33:47.700 --> 01:33:49.860]   There's nothing to do.
[01:33:49.860 --> 01:33:56.840]   In other states, it may be that if you paid off the other spouse's premarital debt, that
[01:33:56.840 --> 01:34:02.880]   at the end of the day, you get some sort of credit for that or some sort of reimbursement
[01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:06.480]   when otherwise dividing up assets and debts or some sort of special consideration.
[01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:10.440]   So, it really just depends on the specific laws of your state.
[01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:17.940]   The only way to really know that for sure, well, I guess two ways would be to speak with
[01:34:17.940 --> 01:34:19.220]   a lawyer in your jurisdiction.
[01:34:19.220 --> 01:34:26.700]   But if you want to have control over the outcome, would be to get an agreement that addresses
[01:34:26.700 --> 01:34:29.300]   those particular circumstances.
[01:34:29.300 --> 01:34:33.020]   Miriam, did I see your hand up before?
[01:34:33.020 --> 01:34:34.020]   Yes.
[01:34:34.020 --> 01:34:38.260]   I have a question on retirement assets.
[01:34:38.260 --> 01:34:45.000]   Since they are individually owned, they are individual assets, and there are beneficiaries
[01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:59.140]   for when the person passes away, but in a divorce, even before the retiree can access
[01:34:59.140 --> 01:35:04.360]   his own retirement accounts, because there would be a penalty to access it before that,
[01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:13.640]   how would you put that into a divorce or into a prenuptial ahead of time passing of retirement
[01:35:13.640 --> 01:35:14.640]   assets?
[01:35:14.640 --> 01:35:22.620]   Your 401(k) is yours, paid for out of your employment assets.
[01:35:22.620 --> 01:35:34.000]   Your traditional IRA is yours also, funded by your employment, you have to have employment.
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:37.920]   The actual money can come from somewhere else, but you have to have the employment that justifies
[01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:38.920]   it.
[01:35:38.920 --> 01:35:42.880]   With the Roth, you never have to take money out of it, ever.
[01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:48.380]   How does this, it like forces you to do things, is that what it is?
[01:35:48.380 --> 01:35:57.080]   So great question, and very insightful that, for example, that alimony alternative where
[01:35:57.080 --> 01:36:03.200]   you might be paying a Roth IRA, of course, that's dependent on the other spouse actually
[01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:09.420]   getting, receiving income and being eligible for a Roth IRA on the one hand.
[01:36:09.420 --> 01:36:15.600]   So I think that's a fair point, and I think it may be that part of that, and oftentimes
[01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:22.740]   arrangements like that, there is a private business or something like that, which may
[01:36:22.740 --> 01:36:28.160]   be required as well to provide some sort of income to that spouse so that they can then
[01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:29.440]   go and have an IRA.
[01:36:29.440 --> 01:36:34.440]   So it's really, it's just a situation dependent, but I know that your question was also more
[01:36:34.440 --> 01:36:42.760]   broad than that about what happens in the event of a divorce to IRAs, to 401ks, there
[01:36:42.760 --> 01:36:48.080]   are other things that kind of go in that category as well, military pensions, for example, or
[01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:56.060]   other things, which if you withdrew from it early, that you may be subject to a penalty.
[01:36:56.060 --> 01:37:05.140]   So I know based on Florida law, and I think pretty much all other states do it this way
[01:37:05.140 --> 01:37:14.180]   as well, but you need to speak with a lawyer in your particular jurisdiction, that there's
[01:37:14.180 --> 01:37:22.680]   an exception for tax penalties for most assets when you are dividing it pursuant to a divorce.
[01:37:22.680 --> 01:37:31.660]   So for example, with an IRA or a Roth IRA, that that can be divided, put from money from
[01:37:31.660 --> 01:37:40.260]   one person, one person's IRA into an, it can be rolled over into another person's IRA,
[01:37:40.260 --> 01:37:46.300]   or on the Roth side, a Roth IRA rolled over into the other person's Roth IRA pursuant
[01:37:46.300 --> 01:37:51.260]   to a divorce without getting penalized for it.
[01:37:51.260 --> 01:37:56.580]   Now, there are certain retirement accounts where it's a little bit more complicated than
[01:37:56.580 --> 01:37:57.580]   that.
[01:37:57.580 --> 01:38:03.540]   So for example, when we're talking about most employment based retirement accounts, a 401k,
[01:38:03.540 --> 01:38:13.140]   I think it's applicable to a 403b, a 457, and it's also similarly applicable to military
[01:38:13.140 --> 01:38:16.020]   pensions and other types of pensions.
[01:38:16.020 --> 01:38:23.460]   There's a special type of order when you get divorced that you need to make sure is
[01:38:23.460 --> 01:38:28.140]   drafted so that these accounts can be split.
[01:38:28.140 --> 01:38:34.420]   In general, it's known as a qualified domestic relations order.
[01:38:34.420 --> 01:38:48.540]   Q, it's acronym is QDRO, it's known as QUADRO by those in the divorce profession and it
[01:38:48.540 --> 01:38:57.780]   basically says that those qualified plans can be divided without penalty if you go through
[01:38:57.780 --> 01:39:03.900]   a process and that process usually includes, first off, making sure that the plan is a
[01:39:03.900 --> 01:39:11.940]   qualified plan and there's a whole definition of what that means in the IRS code and then
[01:39:11.940 --> 01:39:16.820]   sending a proposed order splitting that to a plan administrator just to make sure that
[01:39:16.820 --> 01:39:20.700]   it can be split and then having a judge sign it off.
[01:39:20.700 --> 01:39:27.020]   And so this is actually a very challenging, somewhat tedious process and you have to be
[01:39:27.020 --> 01:39:31.780]   very specific because the last thing you want to do is screw up the split of a 401k or other
[01:39:31.780 --> 01:39:34.460]   big thing, especially if you saved a lot of money in it.
[01:39:34.460 --> 01:39:41.700]   And so even though I do a lot of divorce work, I actually don't draft QUADROs.
[01:39:41.700 --> 01:39:48.500]   There are specific attorneys day in and day out who all they do is QUADROs.
[01:39:48.500 --> 01:39:52.340]   Now that sounds like the most boring job in the world for me, but they, I guess, make
[01:39:52.340 --> 01:39:57.500]   some good money doing it or I guess they get some kick out of it.
[01:39:57.500 --> 01:39:59.500]   So that's what they do.
[01:39:59.500 --> 01:40:05.740]   And then there are orders that aren't exactly QUADROs but are basically the same concept
[01:40:05.740 --> 01:40:10.940]   for some other assets like military pensions.
[01:40:10.940 --> 01:40:16.380]   It's usually called a military retirement order or something similar to that.
[01:40:16.380 --> 01:40:20.940]   There are certain other pensions, again, it just depends on your jurisdiction, but I know
[01:40:20.940 --> 01:40:25.940]   here in Florida, like there's certain municipal pensions that regardless of what you agreed
[01:40:25.940 --> 01:40:28.180]   upon, it just can't be divided.
[01:40:28.180 --> 01:40:34.600]   And so rather than do that, oftentimes there may be some sort of buyout or some other way,
[01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:40.720]   some thing where, well, once the spouse receives the pension, then they're responsible for
[01:40:40.720 --> 01:40:44.420]   providing a portion of it to the other spouse.
[01:40:44.420 --> 01:40:48.260]   So again, attorney answer, it depends, but great question.
[01:40:48.260 --> 01:40:49.260]   Thank you.
[01:40:49.260 --> 01:40:50.260]   Thank you.
[01:40:50.260 --> 01:40:51.260]   Nice answer.
[01:40:51.260 --> 01:40:52.260]   Thank you.
[01:40:52.260 --> 01:40:58.600]   So is that sort of thing, the QUADRO and similar type division of retirement assets or other
[01:40:58.600 --> 01:41:04.940]   assets would not necessarily be addressed in a prenup, perhaps in a post-nup, but is
[01:41:04.940 --> 01:41:09.860]   that the sort of thing you would actually anticipate and build into a prenup or post-nup
[01:41:09.860 --> 01:41:14.020]   or would that be something that basically is dealt with during an actual divorce?
[01:41:14.020 --> 01:41:15.020]   Yeah.
[01:41:15.020 --> 01:41:20.780]   You know, I'd say the majority of the time it's usually dealt with at the time of an
[01:41:20.780 --> 01:41:26.900]   actual divorce in an agreement, reaffirming the prenup or post-nup, but there've been
[01:41:26.900 --> 01:41:33.520]   times where I've added it in because you just want to make sure that there are discussions
[01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:39.180]   not only about, you know, that both, even if they're at the point of divorce, even if
[01:41:39.180 --> 01:41:43.740]   they're angry at each other, make it binding that they're going to cooperate for all of
[01:41:43.740 --> 01:41:46.300]   the steps that are needed to complete that process.
[01:41:46.300 --> 01:41:51.620]   And sometimes you also want to address how that QUADRO or other order will be paid for.
[01:41:51.620 --> 01:41:53.820]   So that, that can also be addressed in a prenup or post-nup.
[01:41:53.820 --> 01:41:54.820]   Any other questions?
[01:41:54.820 --> 01:42:03.180]   It would seem to me in the prenup, it might be there, I don't want to say accidentally,
[01:42:03.180 --> 01:42:08.300]   but it might be that all funds, all of our accounts, all of our retirement accounts might
[01:42:08.300 --> 01:42:13.300]   be put in as a general expression by an attorney, and then they didn't realize that they were
[01:42:13.300 --> 01:42:16.300]   including retirement assets.
[01:42:16.300 --> 01:42:19.300]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:42:19.300 --> 01:42:26.100]   And you want to make sure that it's done clearly and so sometimes it's helpful to address those
[01:42:26.100 --> 01:42:31.300]   items from the top, from the front end.
[01:42:31.300 --> 01:42:36.220]   Yeah, especially since some retirement assets, I'm sorry, some retirement assets could be
[01:42:36.220 --> 01:42:46.420]   put if the, if the person had, had, you know, megabath, you know, different, a certain kind
[01:42:46.420 --> 01:42:49.860]   of job where they could put a lot of money into the retirement accounts.
[01:42:49.860 --> 01:42:56.660]   Yeah, yeah, I think it sounded like you were referencing if you have the option of a megabath
[01:42:56.660 --> 01:43:03.340]   door Roth IRA, which may, you know, for some of those, you may know that may be a way to
[01:43:03.340 --> 01:43:05.140]   have more than the typical limits.
[01:43:05.140 --> 01:43:15.880]   I think right now the, I think this year the limits for your regular 401k is $23,500 and
[01:43:15.880 --> 01:43:20.740]   there are certain retirement plans that allow for a larger amount.
[01:43:20.740 --> 01:43:27.500]   I think maybe what $69,000 or $72,000 total, something like that.
[01:43:27.500 --> 01:43:31.580]   So yeah, that it may especially be a concern in those situations, but there is so much
[01:43:31.580 --> 01:43:35.120]   money that's saved up in a 401k.
[01:43:35.120 --> 01:43:36.120]   Thank you.
[01:43:36.120 --> 01:43:37.120]   Yeah.
[01:43:37.120 --> 01:43:38.120]   Allen.
[01:43:38.120 --> 01:43:39.120]   Yes.
[01:43:39.120 --> 01:43:44.100]   I was going to say one thing I want to emphasize a couple of points is that I think in the
[01:43:44.100 --> 01:43:50.020]   past, I think most people viewed the concept of conversation of prenup kind of in a negative
[01:43:50.020 --> 01:43:53.340]   manner that somebody is trying to control the future of the marriage.
[01:43:53.340 --> 01:43:59.060]   But I think it's important that by opening the conversation amongst the betrothed couple,
[01:43:59.060 --> 01:44:05.060]   that it actually is setting them up on a better foundation with having their transparent finances
[01:44:05.060 --> 01:44:06.980]   in a shared vision for their future.
[01:44:06.980 --> 01:44:12.620]   And I wish and hope that over time that society will view it more in a collaborative fashion
[01:44:12.620 --> 01:44:18.020]   and building for the future and minimizing the risk of divorce certainly and getting
[01:44:18.020 --> 01:44:21.580]   them off on a stronger foundation.
[01:44:21.580 --> 01:44:25.980]   As somebody who is in a blended family in a second marriage myself, I found that to
[01:44:25.980 --> 01:44:26.980]   be the case.
[01:44:26.980 --> 01:44:31.860]   And actually I did, we did get a prenup, not the first time around, but the second time
[01:44:31.860 --> 01:44:32.860]   around.
[01:44:32.860 --> 01:44:38.020]   And that opened up a lot of difficult conversations, but allowed us to share our perspectives,
[01:44:38.020 --> 01:44:41.260]   especially with a blended family with each of our own children.
[01:44:41.260 --> 01:44:45.700]   And the process generally was helpful and positive.
[01:44:45.700 --> 01:44:49.060]   And I've been married happily for 25 years, I might add.
[01:44:49.060 --> 01:44:54.900]   Another thing I might add peripherally as having a daughter who's now engaged.
[01:44:54.900 --> 01:44:58.340]   One of the things I didn't want to bring up, I asked that question earlier about possibly
[01:44:58.340 --> 01:45:01.900]   bringing up the topic of a prenup to an engaged couple.
[01:45:01.900 --> 01:45:07.260]   But one thing I did is tell my daughter and her fiance that I would gladly pay for them
[01:45:07.260 --> 01:45:13.380]   to meet with an independent financial advisor, fee only, to get themselves off on a solid
[01:45:13.380 --> 01:45:19.420]   financial planning life together and to build some of that transparency and understanding
[01:45:19.420 --> 01:45:21.220]   in before they get married.
[01:45:21.220 --> 01:45:22.340]   And they took me up on the offer.
[01:45:22.340 --> 01:45:25.200]   I was happy to pay for it and they found it very helpful.
[01:45:25.200 --> 01:45:30.380]   And that's something that I think is another avenue with certainly with considering marriage
[01:45:30.380 --> 01:45:36.860]   yourself to approach your fiance, your future partner, about the sharing that process.
[01:45:36.860 --> 01:45:40.660]   Or as a parent of adult children that are getting married, to suggest that.
[01:45:40.660 --> 01:45:47.060]   Not to force them, nor coerce them, but it's just something else to consider in having
[01:45:47.060 --> 01:45:50.060]   that transparency and planning together.
[01:45:50.060 --> 01:45:55.780]   Yeah, that's great, Alan, thank you so much for sharing that.
[01:45:55.780 --> 01:46:01.660]   And I think I'm glad to hear that it was a more positive experience.
[01:46:01.660 --> 01:46:08.660]   And again, I think it's got a very negative connotation again.
[01:46:08.660 --> 01:46:15.580]   I think probably deservedly so, because I think people have seen kind of the worst of
[01:46:15.580 --> 01:46:17.620]   how it can be done.
[01:46:17.620 --> 01:46:23.940]   And so I hope to show that there are alternative ways in how it can be done, but also how it
[01:46:23.940 --> 01:46:26.340]   can be thought of in the first place.
[01:46:26.340 --> 01:46:29.820]   So just opening up the conversations.
[01:46:29.820 --> 01:46:37.780]   I also like to tell clients, I hope that this is helpful enough that this becomes the most
[01:46:37.780 --> 01:46:41.740]   useless document that you're ever going to sign.
[01:46:41.740 --> 01:46:51.500]   And that you all have a lovely and wonderful future together with each other.
[01:46:51.500 --> 01:46:59.060]   And hopefully having these challenging conversations up front will allow you to do that.
[01:46:59.060 --> 01:47:00.700]   All righty.
[01:47:00.700 --> 01:47:06.380]   Any final questions, folks?
[01:47:06.380 --> 01:47:09.100]   If not, let me thank you, Adam, for a wonderful presentation.
[01:47:09.100 --> 01:47:15.580]   Really opened up our eyes to all the aspects of this for consideration, and certainly familiarizing
[01:47:15.580 --> 01:47:19.900]   us all with the collaborative process, which many of us were not previously familiar with.
[01:47:19.900 --> 01:47:24.940]   Thank you, Miriam, for helping out as a moderator, and for everybody for participating.
[01:47:24.940 --> 01:47:30.580]   In a moment, I'm going to end the recording, but after I end the recording, I want to do
[01:47:30.580 --> 01:47:33.500]   an exit poll just to get feedback from everybody.
[01:47:33.500 --> 01:47:38.020]   And I also want to encourage everybody to check with your local Boglehead chapters,
[01:47:38.020 --> 01:47:44.620]   as well as checking with the online in the blog on the Boglehead's website is the calendar
[01:47:44.620 --> 01:47:50.620]   of events for both other live stage and local chapter meetings that are upcoming.
[01:47:50.620 --> 01:47:56.280]   And if you don't have a local Boglehead's chapter in your area, consider starting one.
[01:47:56.280 --> 01:47:57.280]   So thank you again, Adam.
[01:47:57.280 --> 01:47:58.280]   That was fantastic.
[01:47:58.280 --> 01:48:25.960]   And we'll make arrangements to share his slide deck in one fashion or another.
