[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   A podcast listener named Louis writes in to ask this, "Hello Pastor John, in Romans 8.13
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.760]   Paul is addressing believers saying that if they live according to the flesh they will die.
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:20.920]   What does Paul mean by saying to believers that they will die if they continue living according to the flesh after having been sealed
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.600]   by the Spirit?"
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.160]   So Louis and I agree that when a person is born again and
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.160]   receives eternal life
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:39.640]   and is sealed by the Spirit, united to Christ, adopted into God's family, justified, this person will never perish.
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.320]   I think he's assuming that, I'm assuming that.
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:50.760]   He will be kept by God. He is eternally secure. He'll never be lost. He may backslide,
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.840]   but not indefinitely and forever. God will hold on to him and cause him to return.
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.840]   And we believe it because of
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:06.000]   Romans 8.30, "Those whom he predestined he called and those we called he justified and those we justified he glorified." No dropouts
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:15.600]   between predestination and glorification. Or Philippians 1.6, "He who began a good work in you will complete it." Or 1 Corinthians 1.8,
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.680]   "He will sustain you to the end, guiltless in the day of Christ." So,
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.800]   yes, we're on the same page when it comes to the perseverance of the saints or
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:34.560]   eternal security. Question then, well, what do the warnings of the New Testament mean when believers are addressed with
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.360]   threats that say they could perish? What in the world does that mean?
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.880]   So Romans 8.12,
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.240]   "So then,
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:51.120]   brothers, we are debtors not to the flesh to live according to the flesh. For if you live according to the flesh, you will die.
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.520]   But if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live.
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.440]   For all who are led by the Spirit of God are the sons of God."
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:05.920]   Now that last phrase is crucial because what he's saying is the reason you will live
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:14.440]   if you put to death the deeds of the body by the Spirit is that you will show yourself to be led by
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.080]   God and thus a son of God.
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.480]   Those who are led by the Spirit to put to death the deeds of the body by the Spirit are
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.600]   the sons of God. And the sons of God cannot die, but if you're not a son of God,
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.800]   you will die. And so I think the warning there is not that
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:36.720]   believers can perish, but that so-called believers can show that they're not sons of God.
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.480]   They may not be what they
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.920]   say or think they are.
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.720]   Here it is again in Galatians 5.18,
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:52.480]   "But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law." And then comes this warning
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.360]   after a list of the works of the flesh.
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.040]   "I warn you, I warn you." She's talking to the church.
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.200]   "I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.040]   will not inherit the kingdom of God."
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.920]   So the point is the same as Romans 8.13.
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:15.200]   If you are led by the Spirit to make war on the works of the flesh,
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.320]   or you surrender to the work of the flesh,
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.920]   you're gonna go in opposite directions.
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:29.920]   If you surrender to God and make war on the works of the flesh by the power of the Spirit,
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.760]   you won't perish. You will go into the kingdom of
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.320]   heaven. But if you
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.640]   surrender to the works of the flesh, don't make war on them. Make peace with sin.
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.360]   You will show that you are not born of God and you will
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:51.960]   be destroyed. You will not enter into the kingdom of heaven. Same thing again in 1 Corinthians 6.8,
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.120]   "You yourselves wrong and defraud even your brothers," he says.
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.960]   So he's pointing to a real problem in the church and then he says, "Don't you know that the
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.160]   unrighteous won't inherit the kingdom of God?"
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:09.600]   Then he lists a whole bunch of them, including thieves and greedy and drunkards, and says
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:15.920]   they will not inherit the kingdom of God. So he's saying to them, "Look, you are starting to act
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:21.560]   like people who won't inherit the kingdom. If you go on in this way, you will prove yourself to be
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.040]   false to the faith." Now, the reason I feel free
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:31.200]   to draw out that kind of interpretation is because in 1 John 2.19,
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.800]   it says, "They went out from us because they were not of us.
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.640]   For if they had been of us, they would have continued with us." In other words,
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:46.800]   if you're truly a Christian, you persevere. But they went out that it might be complained that they were not of us.
[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.680]   So the warnings are given to the whole church as a church
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:59.000]   with the assumption that those who are truly born of God will take heed to the warnings, apply them to their lives, and
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   prove that they are part of Christ rather than part of the world. And here's one last
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:13.760]   confirmation of this in Hebrews 13.12, following, "Take care, brothers, lest there be in any of you an evil, unbelieving heart,
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:20.080]   leading you to fall away from the living God. But exhort one another every day, as long as it is called today,
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:25.240]   that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin."
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.800]   So he's addressing the whole church as a body saying, "Watch out.
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:37.040]   You can be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin, and you can drift and fall away from God." Now, does that mean
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.720]   believers can lose their salvation?
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:47.200]   Here's what verse 14 says, so crucial, one of the most important verses in Hebrews, I think, maybe in the New Testament. Verse 14,
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.120]   "For
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.240]   we have come to share in Christ if
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:59.320]   indeed we hold our original confidence firm to the end."
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:04.360]   We have come, we have come to share in Christ if
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:10.320]   we hold fast. That is, if we fight sin, if we resist hardening. It does not say
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:18.440]   we will come to share in Christ if we hold fast. It says you're holding fast to the end.
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:26.360]   You're fighting the fight of faith. You're putting to death the deeds of the body by the Spirit. All of them show that you have
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.920]   come to share in
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:35.080]   Christ, not that you will. So all of our labors and works in the Christian life are
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.720]   evidences that we are
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.160]   real, and when they are missing,
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.880]   it's not that we cease to become born again,
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:47.840]   but that when we end this life in that condition,
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:54.920]   having turned on God, having not fought the fight of faith, you will be shown not to be part of Christ.
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:58.560]   So my word is take up the sword of the Spirit and
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:02.480]   put to death the sinful deeds of the body with the confidence that
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:09.440]   Christ is in you and will fight for you and will never ever let you go. Yes, amen.
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:16.360]   Thank you, Pastor John, for that. And on a related note, see episode number 223, "Does John 15 Defy Calvinism?" and
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:22.920]   episode number 102, "Can a Born-Again Christian Lose Salvation?" You can find both those episodes in the podcast archive.
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.000]   Those are episodes number 223 and
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:32.040]   102. And speaking of hard topics, tomorrow a podcast listener writes in to ask if God, in his wisdom,
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:38.840]   predestines sinners to hell. We'll be back tomorrow with that. I'm your host Tony Reinke. Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
