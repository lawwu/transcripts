[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160]   What's up everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai and in this episode I want to talk
[00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:10.120]   about two retirement philosophies that will determine your safe withdrawal rate.
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:15.040]   I'm very focused on re-retiring right now because I'm so damn tired.
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:21.040]   I gotta say man, every day I wake up it just seems a little bit harder.
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.760]   Are any of you guys experiencing the same thing?
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.120]   You know in the past I would write a post, you know, starting at like 9 p.m. and get
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:33.400]   it done by 11 p.m., schedule it for the next morning and then boom, ready to go.
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.240]   Now after about 8.30 p.m. it's a long day raising kids.
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.840]   I'm just thinking well you know I'm gonna watch some Netflix, watch my favorite show,
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.040]   I'm watching The Sinner now, it's kind of crazy but it's kind of worth it if you like
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:51.480]   thrillers and just going to bed and waking up when I wake up, which is whenever I wake
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.240]   up because I don't have an alarm, and then start writing.
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.000]   So that's why you're seeing a lot of these posts come out later and later because I'm
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.600]   thinking man I just need a break, I need to sleep.
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.080]   And at the same time I'm still able to publish three times a week, it's just not coming out
[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.720]   at three in the morning, it's coming out maybe midday.
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.460]   So if you've been wondering why I haven't been recording more podcasts and writing more
[00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.560]   posts and publishing them earlier, it's because I'm burned out.
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.120]   And I've got to believe some of you guys are burned out as well, but we've just got to
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:28.200]   keep on going, we've got to keep on going because that's what life is about.
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.600]   When your back's against the wall you just got to keep focused, focus, focus, focus,
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.600]   and stay committed.
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.440]   So let's talk about the two different retirement philosophies.
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:42.960]   A while ago I proposed a new safe withdrawal rate rule or guide.
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.240]   It's basically whatever the 10-year bond yield is times 80%.
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:55.120]   So currently the 10-year bond yield is around 1.5%, therefore times that by 80% and the
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.000]   withdrawal rate will be about 1.2%.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.200]   So if you withdraw at a 1.2% rate, you're probably going to be very safe and you're
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.200]   probably going to have enough capital left over to actually donate to people and help
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.840]   other people out after you pass.
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.560]   And I think that's a great thing.
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.060]   But that's not what everybody thinks when they think about retirement and when they
[00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.260]   think about dying.
[00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.780]   That's why there's two different retirement philosophies.
[00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.960]   The first retirement philosophy is to spend all your money before you die.
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:28.560]   In other words, you wish to accomplish complete portfolio depletion or very close to it upon
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.840]   your death.
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.360]   Your money which you earned is mainly there for you to spend.
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.120]   Very logical, very reasonable.
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.440]   And since you can't take your money with you, you might as well spend it all while
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.440]   alive.
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:46.240]   So let's call this the YOLO retirement philosophy, the you only live once retirement philosophy.
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.840]   The second retirement philosophy is to leave a legacy with your estate which will survive
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.860]   long after you're gone.
[00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.120]   Your legacy may involve providing a perpetual giving machine to charities you care about
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.240]   or taking care of your kids, even if they're adults.
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.120]   It may also include an ongoing donation to your college alma mater or steps to ensure
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.040]   your family business continues to run for years into the future after you're gone.
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.380]   Let's call this the legacy retirement philosophy.
[00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.920]   So YOLO retirement philosophy and legacy retirement philosophy.
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.800]   I think most people are likely somewhere in between the spectrum.
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.780]   However, the people who closely adopt the first retirement philosophy of spending everything
[00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:34.800]   they have before they die seem to be the main critics of the financial samurai safe withdrawal
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.760]   rate formula of 10 year bond yield times 80%.
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.840]   Now in case you're wondering how I came up with this formula, well, it's kind of a back
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.280]   of the envelope calculation.
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:51.440]   Back in the late 1990s, when the 4% rule was introduced and popularized by the Trinity
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.240]   study, the 10 year bond yield was about 5%.
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:01.640]   So therefore 4% is a safe withdrawal rate is 80% of 5%.
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.640]   It's a very simple rule guys.
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:09.200]   But my logic was, hey, it's not rocket science to say, hey, if you withdraw at a 4% safe
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.360]   withdrawal rate, while the risk free rate of return is 5%, you're going to be just fine
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.360]   in retirement.
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.360]   I mean, come on.
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.320]   I mean, do you really need a PhD and lots of funding and doing massive amounts of research
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.240]   to come up with that conclusion?
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.920]   So my financial samurai safe withdrawal rate rule is a play on that.
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.320]   And you can obviously withdraw at a higher rate if you want.
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.960]   2% is fine, 3% is fine, 4% is fine.
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.640]   You can go higher than 4% if you want, but probably not for years and years and years
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:44.680]   because you will probably run out of money or get close to a point where you'll feel
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.360]   uncomfortable.
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.940]   And deciding how much to withdraw is really going to be up to you.
[00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:56.120]   You won't really know how much you are comfortable withdrawing in retirement until you are retired.
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.940]   Now I went through a one year period of retirement from 2012 to 2013.
[00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.480]   And I was uncomfortable withdrawing anything.
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:08.560]   I didn't touch principal at all, because I had been saving aggressively and investing
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.920]   aggressively since I graduated college in 1999.
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.600]   You might be different after 30 years of saving and investing.
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.460]   You'd be like, well, I got to spend my money and what's the point?
[00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.240]   But again, be flexible in your thought.
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.240]   You won't really know until you get there.
[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:29.280]   At my high school graduation ceremony, I remember James Carville, a political strategist, came
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.660]   to speak to us.
[00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:35.240]   He concluded his speech by saying, "Leave each place better than you found it."
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.280]   And that made a big impression on me at 18 years old.
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.680]   It really made me care about the environment more and the people I worked with.
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:48.920]   Instead of giving your two weeks notice and quitting, for example, give a much longer
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:51.060]   notice so you can train your replacement.
[00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:55.240]   Right now, quitting your job, you might leave your manager in a lurch and he or she might
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.320]   not really appreciate it.
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:01.480]   But if you can find ways to come up with a replacement and a smooth transition, you have
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.240]   a better chance of negotiating a severance.
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.520]   When you're running up and down the public steps for exercise and you see litter on the
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.880]   streets, maybe pick it up and throw it away.
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:16.440]   This is kind of the philosophy of leaving each place better than you found it.
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:20.560]   And the more you think about this type of attitude, the more I think you're going to
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.940]   align with the legacy retirement philosophy.
[00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:30.880]   And the stronger you adopt the legacy retirement philosophy, the lower your safe withdrawal
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:35.720]   rate will be in retirement because you want to leave more money to other people, to help
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.200]   other people, institutions and so forth.
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:42.960]   And frankly, the more you don't give a damn about other people, I think the more you're
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:47.760]   going to focus on the YOLO retirement philosophy and you're going to spend your money as you
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:52.400]   see fit, which I cannot blame you for doing.
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.280]   We should all be doing that.
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:07:00.600]   Aligning with mega millions or billions is simply inefficient way of spending capital
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.040]   over your lifetime.
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:08.660]   But given there's so much poverty out there, so many people who need help, spending all
[00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:12.960]   your money on yourself is not the most magnanimous way to go.
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:17.960]   Now of course, you can dedicate your life and your money to helping other people while
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.980]   living and that is a great way to go.
[00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:27.680]   So again, we're probably in between the two bookends, YOLO or legacy.
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:32.880]   And personally, I want to be closer to the legacy retirement because as you get older,
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:38.720]   you just naturally think about what you are contributing to society and what you can continue
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.680]   to contribute to society after you're dead.
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:47.880]   I think it's just a natural evolutionary way we think about life and death.
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:53.200]   I mean, this is the way we can help subsequent generations hopefully get better.
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:57.580]   If there was no thoughts about legacy as we get older and wealthier, then why would there
[00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:02.320]   be these billionaires and very wealthy people donating tons of money to their alma maters
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:04.280]   to name a wing after them?
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:10.560]   Why are these very rich people donating tons of money to get anything named after them?
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:12.680]   It's probably due to legacy.
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:18.760]   Why do parents name their kids Junior or John the second, third, fourth, fifth?
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.620]   It's due to legacy.
[00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:23.780]   And in that regard, ironically, it's a little bit selfish, right?
[00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:29.640]   If you're using your money for your legacy, that's by definition focusing on yourself.
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:33.460]   In terms of legacy, you got to ask yourself what you're doing with your life, what is
[00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:38.660]   your job and will it mean anything after you're gone or once you're retired?
[00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:43.920]   When I was working in finance, I didn't feel much legacy generation at all.
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:48.120]   It was really more about building a career, making and saving as much money as possible
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.940]   so I could do something else.
[00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:54.740]   But now with Financial Samurai, I feel like I'm creating a legacy because the internet
[00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:55.740]   is forever.
[00:08:55.740 --> 00:09:00.180]   The writing will be forever so long as I pay my server dues and renew the domain every
[00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:02.660]   whatever it is, five, ten years.
[00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:07.640]   And you can also see how my writing has changed from 2009 to now.
[00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:13.520]   Back then, I was much, much, much more opinionated and maybe a little bit inflammatory, maybe
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:14.520]   a little bit offensive.
[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:15.900]   I don't know.
[00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:20.600]   But now I think I'm much more moderate and I definitely want to include as many people
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.640]   as possible and see all sides.
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:27.220]   And part of it is because I know one day my kids will listen to these podcasts and read
[00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:30.300]   my writing and I don't want to come across as a jerk, right?
[00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:35.020]   Of course, I'm still going to have my strong opinions on various topics, which I strongly
[00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:38.260]   believe in, such as safe withdrawal rate.
[00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.060]   I don't think should be 4%.
[00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:41.060]   No way.
[00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:46.060]   But I'm going to make the arguments in a respectful manner to try to see all sides of the equation.
[00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:47.900]   So I'd love to hear from all of you.
[00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:53.220]   Are you closer to the YOLO retirement philosophy of spending everything you have and leaving
[00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:54.660]   nothing behind?
[00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:58.060]   Or are you closer to the legacy retirement philosophy?
[00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:01.180]   Leave a comment in the post, shoot me an email.
[00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:02.340]   I'd love to hear from you.
[00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:07.620]   And if you enjoyed this podcast, I'd appreciate a positive review and stay safe, everyone.
[00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:09.460]   Summer is here.
[00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:10.460]   Summer is here.
[00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:11.460]   Thank goodness.
[00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:13.740]   And I'm planning on taking things down a notch.
