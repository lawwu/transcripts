[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.620]   Stomach acid literally kills pathogens.
[00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:07.240]   So there was a study that was done in 2021, and it showed that people who are blocking
[00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:13.120]   stomach acid with these potent drugs called proton pump inhibitors, those people had a
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.580]   two to four fold increased risk of getting sick with COVID when they were exposed to
[00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:18.020]   the virus.
[00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.280]   Because normally when you have intact stomach acid, you swallow SARS-CoV-2, you can breathe
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.560]   it in, but you can also swallow it.
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.800]   And then that stomach acid unravels a viral protein and inactivates it.
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.980]   And it does it for all kinds of different viruses.
[00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.920]   It can protect you from polio virus and from different bacteria.
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:40.060]   And when I say protect lower incidence compared to not like I'm bulletproof, I have stomach
[00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.860]   acid, viruses can't make me sick.
