[00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.980]   Today on Radical Personal Finance, it's a live Q&A.
[00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:48.980]   [music]
[00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.040]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.840]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.640]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:59.640]   My name is Joshua Sheets.
[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.640]   I am your host.
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:07.760]   Today is Friday, May 10, 2024, and on this Friday, as I do on any Friday in which I can
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.320]   arrange the appropriate technology to record, we do live Q&A.
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.640]   You set the agenda for these shows.
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.640]   It's all up to you.
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:21.920]   [music]
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.200]   Here on Radical Personal Finance, Friday is open line Friday.
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.680]   You can call in, talk about anything that you want, raise any topic that you want, ask
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.680]   any questions that you want.
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.680]   It can be personal in nature.
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.440]   We can talk about your situation.
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:33.600]   It can be general in nature.
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.320]   We can talk about any theory, any philosophy that you have, any questions.
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.840]   You're welcome to raise any beefs you have with me, any points of disagreement.
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:41.840]   I enjoy that.
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.280]   I think that good interaction provides us with a good opportunity to get closer and
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.720]   closer to truth in our society, and so I love it when you guys do that.
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.480]   If you would like to join me for one of these Friday Q&A shows, you can do that by going
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:02:00.920]   to patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance, patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance, sign up, support the show on Patreon, and that will gain access
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.080]   for you to one of our Friday Q&A shows, and then you'll be able to join me next week.
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.880]   We begin today with Shaw in Ohio.
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:08.880]   Shaw, welcome to the show.
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:09.880]   How can I serve you today?
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:10.880]   Hey, Joshua.
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.080]   Thanks so much.
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.480]   I have two questions, if we can get to both, but one is more pressing.
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.360]   My wife and I recently welcomed our baby girl.
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.360]   Congratulations.
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.360]   Thank you.
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.360]   Thank you.
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.800]   The baby came early, so she came in 26 weeks, and we're dealing with some NICU stuff.
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.680]   Not the home birth that we were anticipating, but certainly grateful for the care that we're
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.800]   getting.
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:45.400]   One thing that has come up is that we were trying to avoid giving the baby a […] for
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.400]   various reasons.
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.400]   Hold on.
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.400]   Hang on just a moment.
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.160]   You broke up right when you were saying we're trying to avoid giving the baby a […] Hang
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.160]   on one second.
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.160]   Let's get synced up.
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.360]   You're trying to avoid.
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.360]   Hold on.
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.360]   Hold on.
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.360]   You're trying to avoid.
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.560]   Start from there, please.
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.800]   We were trying to avoid giving the baby a social security number, but through human
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:12.000]   error, the paperwork got filed, and the hospital admitted their error to us.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.480]   My question is about these sorts of matters.
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.480]   There are various reasons to avoid having a social security number, but I don't know
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:29.880]   if you […] the number deleted or voided.
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.320]   Apparently, those could be options for us.
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:40.000]   We are aware that we could get passport information for the baby just using the birth certificate,
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.120]   and that was our intention originally.
[00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.200]   I don't know, from an international escape standpoint, if having a voided or deleted
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.420]   social security number shows up in a system in any way that would make a border crossing
[00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.880]   any more onerous than it needs to be.
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.680]   Wow.
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.600]   First of all, how's your baby doing?
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.600]   Is she recovering?
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:03.600]   Is she growing?
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.320]   Is everything on the right track?
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:07.320]   For the most part, yes.
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.680]   She was growing really well.
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.640]   It looks like she is dealing with a little bit of an infection, but she's responding
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:19.680]   to the treatment, and so, you know, continued prayers to God for God's grace and for the
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.600]   excellent medical staff and all of that sort of thing.
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:28.600]   I am enormous for all of the commentary and things that I have to say and try to encourage
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:34.440]   people and as you were undoubtedly hoping for a wonderful, easy, smooth, natural birth.
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:40.520]   I tell you what, we need to thank God continually for the miracle of cesarean delivery.
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:46.120]   We need to thank God continually for the doctors and the nurses and the technology that has
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.120]   been developed.
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.320]   The fact that you could have a baby at 26 weeks and the baby could generally be doing
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.440]   pretty well is absolutely amazing.
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:59.680]   With regard to social security, your specific question, the short answer is I don't really
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.600]   have any idea.
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.400]   I would love, let me answer your question first, and then I'd love you to tell me and
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:11.800]   the audience just a little bit more of what you are hoping to accomplish by the baby not
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:16.800]   having a social security number because that's not something I have talked about publicly,
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.300]   but I think it'd be interesting to hear your perspective.
[00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:24.800]   With regard to the question, I don't know the process of deleting it from the system.
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.200]   I have not been through that.
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.560]   I don't know how it's done.
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.480]   I don't know if it's done.
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.800]   I don't know any of those details.
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.800]   In terms of international border crossings, I don't think it would make any difference
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.080]   with regard to international border crossings whatsoever.
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:45.440]   I've never been asked for a social security number, and I'm not aware of any way that
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:52.500]   that particular number exists in any kind of international context.
[00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:58.040]   So if you are able to successfully suppress and delete the number from the social security
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:05.160]   system, and if subsequently you can have a passport issued for your daughter, I don't
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:09.160]   think you would have any problem from an international perspective.
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.700]   It's just not a number.
[00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:16.160]   It's purely a tax identification number that the United States uses to classify and to
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:22.600]   track people, and it's always used in domestic affairs, but I'm not aware of any use of it
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.560]   on an international basis.
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.440]   So that's the best I can give you, not having gone through the process and not having any
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.440]   more inside information.
[00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:35.280]   Tell us more, though, about what you've learned and what you were hoping to do in terms of
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.480]   avoiding the issuance of a social security number at all.
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:44.960]   Well, I have to admit I'm not entirely clear all of the reasons.
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:51.360]   Some of this comes from being in various sort of freedom communities, where at times people
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.920]   even avoid having birth certificates for their kids.
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:07:00.080]   My best understanding about it is that perhaps it makes a difference if at some point in
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:07.680]   the future you are trying to renounce your citizenship, and it generally just kind of
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:14.640]   falls under the category of trying to provide as little data to a system that we feel is
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:21.760]   really corrupt and does not deserve our data and is not a good steward of our data.
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:36.080]   I would also mention we talked with our CPA, and our credit is minimal from the standpoint
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:40.360]   that some people have said you would need a social security number to claim your child
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:41.960]   as a dependent.
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.600]   But it's not clear that we would really be getting much financial benefit from doing
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:46.600]   that.
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:47.600]   Right.
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.840]   Let me just give you my thoughts.
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:55.440]   If you were calling me up and you were just asking me the question to say, "Hey, Joshua,
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:58.440]   should I get my child a social security number or not?"
[00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:02.920]   Let me just give you what I have thought about on that subject, and you can factor it in
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.880]   to any other research that you have done.
[00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:09.280]   When I had my first child, I hadn't really thought about this, and so I just went down
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.440]   kind of the standard route.
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:15.080]   I assumed that what you should do for children is get their social security numbers.
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:20.160]   I assumed that that was the right thing to do, and that was, of course, the normal path.
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.780]   As always, the normal path is always the easiest path.
[00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:25.760]   Then I started looking into it.
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:28.360]   I can't remember which child it was.
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:33.600]   I realized, "Oh, it is possible to not have a social security identification number for
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:34.600]   a child.
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.600]   It is possible."
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:42.040]   At the end of my inquiries some years ago, though, I came to the conclusion that it is
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:47.200]   possible, but it makes everything continually difficult.
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:52.640]   You need to be very committed to it in order for it to work.
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:58.240]   I respect any person who is so committed to his values and his ideology that he's willing
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.720]   to do extra work.
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:04.120]   You'll always find me a friend in your corner to say, "Good for you for doing it."
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:08.600]   It is important going in that you understand that it is challenging and difficult.
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:14.920]   I would love to see the entire use of the social security number disbanded.
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:20.920]   I think that would be in the spirit of what it means to be an American.
[00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:26.320]   Americans traditionally have famously been suspicious of any kind of national identification
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.320]   number.
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:35.020]   The social security number is a cultural aberration in the broad scale of history of the United
[00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:36.020]   States.
[00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:40.860]   It is a federally issued identification number that's done on a federal basis, that's used
[00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:44.260]   for tracking, that's used for all kinds of purposes.
[00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:49.700]   What I've noticed, however, over the years is that it was a backdoor program.
[00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:55.600]   My social security card says very clearly on it, "This document is not to be used for
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:56.920]   identification purposes.
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:01.500]   It's exclusively for basically interaction with the Social Security Administration."
[00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:05.740]   If my memory is correct, my children's cards, they've removed all of that.
[00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:11.980]   So all of the skepticism that Americans formerly had about the issuing of national identification
[00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:14.900]   numbers seems to have broadly disappeared.
[00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:20.260]   And now most people seem to be pretty accepting of national identification numbers.
[00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:26.200]   And the social security number itself is used as a form of identification that many people
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.200]   request.
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.620]   As you well know, you go to the doctor, you go to the dentist, you go to all kinds of
[00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:33.280]   places, they ask for your social security number.
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:39.220]   So from a freedom governmental perspective, my question is just, does it really matter?
[00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:41.700]   So, first of all, does it really matter?
[00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:45.220]   And number two, is it the most effective approach?
[00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:47.780]   So speaking to does it really matter?
[00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:48.780]   It might.
[00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:52.100]   And again, I'm firmly in favor of anybody who says, "This is my conviction and I'm going
[00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:53.440]   to follow through on it."
[00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:58.620]   It might ultimately matter, but I'm not convinced that it's going to be that big a deal in the
[00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:00.060]   fullness of time.
[00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:03.560]   Whether you're registered with a social security number or not, whether you're registered with
[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:10.280]   a name or not, there's going to be some form of file or identification that's associated
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:11.360]   with you.
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:16.840]   And it's not that hard for an intrusive government to create some tracking mechanism.
[00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:20.920]   Now you can certainly make it a lot easier on them by giving them a social security number
[00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:24.660]   and registering everyone dually, but it's totally doable.
[00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:32.200]   And I think that we're probably with the continual collection of biometrics, we're probably...
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:38.040]   The nightmare dystopian scenario is that it's largely done based on biometrics rather than
[00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:39.700]   anything else.
[00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:44.540]   And any time you interact with the government, if you don't have the social security number,
[00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:49.040]   it makes your interactions more difficult and you could argue that it raises your profile.
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:54.600]   I tried to do a passport application for one of my children born abroad without the
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:58.520]   issuance of a social security number and I found it very difficult.
[00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:04.800]   And ultimately I wound up getting a social security number and registering on that basis.
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:08.800]   Now I wasn't committed, so it's possible that it could have been done by somebody who was
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:13.160]   more committed than I was, but I just found it very difficult and I think that it raises
[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:14.360]   your profile.
[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:20.320]   And with the advanced integration of biometrics, I think that that's probably a bigger concern
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:23.640]   than something like a social security number.
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:30.320]   From a day-to-day basis, I think that your child would face, not having a social security
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:33.280]   number, your child will face many, many challenges.
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:38.160]   Now if you could get a passport issued without a social security number, that would be helpful.
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:41.800]   I don't think you're gonna get a passport issued without a birth certificate, so that
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:43.920]   would seem to be extreme.
[00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:51.240]   And if you wanted to live the kind of lifestyle in which you were totally off the grid, living
[00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:56.480]   within the borders of the United States, but not engaging in kind of the normal things,
[00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:00.560]   flying, going abroad, then I think I would guess that you could do that.
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:05.160]   But I don't think you could do it without, I don't know that you could get a passport
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.640]   without a birth certificate.
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:10.920]   I think the biggest challenge you'll face is the new REAL ID requirements.
[00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:16.520]   I'm personally persuaded that, so if you look at the history of a national identification
[00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:21.120]   number, Americans voted against it time and time and time again.
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:27.880]   I'm convinced the REAL ID Act was basically a backdoor pathway to a national identification
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:33.160]   number, is that after failing many times at establishing a national database where each
[00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:37.680]   citizen of the United States is numbered and counted on a national basis, that the REAL
[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:40.380]   ID was basically the way of getting at that.
[00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:45.780]   And I have not observed, since the implementation of REAL ID, I have not observed any cultural
[00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:47.200]   pushback against that.
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:50.680]   Most people don't seem to realize, they don't seem to care.
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:53.880]   Basically everybody has become REAL ID compliant.
[00:13:53.880 --> 00:14:00.240]   And if you look at kind of the broad acceptance of biometrics, it's pretty astonishing.
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:05.800]   Just as a sake of example, I always refuse biometrics when leaving the United States.
[00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:12.060]   The United States has now integrated an automated biometric camera-based system for leaving
[00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:13.840]   the United States on an airplane.
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:16.100]   You've seen this at the airport when you go to get on an airplane.
[00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:21.220]   I always refuse, and that refusal has been easier in the past.
[00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:25.980]   They specifically state, "Hey, you can refuse," and that refusal was easier in the past.
[00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:30.540]   This last time that I refused, I stood at the gate.
[00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:35.940]   I was the first one in line for boarding my flight with my wife and children, and I refused
[00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:36.940]   biometrics.
[00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:41.380]   Normally when you refuse biometrics, the airline staff comes over and threatens that they need
[00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:45.140]   to call Border Patrol and that they're going to send an agent over, and then you say, "Look,
[00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:49.180]   I'm a U.S. citizen," and frequently they check your passport, and you're through a couple
[00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:50.180]   minutes later.
[00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:55.620]   I stood there for 45 minutes with my wife and children right next to the line because
[00:14:55.620 --> 00:15:03.260]   they refused to let me board without sending a Border Patrol officer to manually inspect
[00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:07.220]   my passport so that we could board without biometric identification.
[00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:10.300]   I stood there, and they threatened in multiple ways.
[00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:13.940]   The airline agent said, "You're probably going to miss this flight because Border Patrol
[00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:17.060]   can't come very quickly, and we're not going to let you board unless you do that," and
[00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:18.860]   I said, "Listen, I was here at the very first.
[00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:19.860]   I'm on time.
[00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:21.460]   I don't know what my rights and rules are, but I'm here.
[00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:22.580]   I'm ready to go.
[00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:23.860]   I've got everything lined up.
[00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:25.740]   I'm simply refusing biometrics."
[00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:26.780]   We went back and forth.
[00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:29.540]   They called Border Patrol, went back and forth, looked at my passport.
[00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:33.220]   Finally, after 45 minutes of intimidation, they finally let me on the airplane.
[00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:38.460]   In the meantime, I got to sit there and watch the entire flight board, and I was the only
[00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:45.020]   one—I and my family—we were the only ones who refused biometrics.
[00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:48.100]   The counter-argument, someone would say, "Well, look, Border Patrol deletes the information
[00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:51.740]   very quickly for U.S. citizens and somewhat more slowly for non-U.S. citizens."
[00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:53.660]   All right, maybe all that's true.
[00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:58.820]   Maybe people have just accepted it, but it's pretty obvious to me that if we've got a plane
[00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:05.620]   of 150 people, and I'm the only one out of 150 people who refuses biometrics, it's pretty
[00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:14.580]   obvious to me that this perspective of opting out is not culturally possible.
[00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:16.360]   It's not culturally strong.
[00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:22.380]   Not many people are—I'm in a very, very small minority, and you, trying to avoid the
[00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:26.900]   issuance of a Social Security number for your child, you're in a very, very small minority.
[00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:31.540]   The question is, is this actually the best solution?
[00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:39.580]   I've pretty well decided that it doesn't make sense to try to live off the grid because
[00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:42.260]   it's not really doable.
[00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:47.140]   It's not really plausibly doable in today's world.
[00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:52.220]   When you do it, because you're so culturally out of place that you probably have a higher
[00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:55.940]   profile than if you don't do it.
[00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:58.060]   I have two arguments.
[00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:04.060]   Number one, that when more data is created, that doesn't necessarily mean that the individual
[00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:09.700]   risk is higher, because now there's so much data being created that more and more stuff
[00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:12.420]   can fall through the cracks.
[00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:17.820]   I don't know that just because they're collecting more data, just because people are all being
[00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:21.980]   issued with Social Security numbers basically automatically, I'm not sure that that's the
[00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:50.260]   great danger for freedom and liberty as some people think it is.
[00:17:50.260 --> 00:18:04.820]   But more importantly, I think that the best form of defense against this is not to try
[00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:08.940]   to be the individual going up against the government, but rather to go and get another
[00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:12.860]   government on your side and to get your governments going at each other.
[00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:17.540]   And so the problem, especially if you didn't have a birth certificate issued, is that you
[00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:22.020]   may be able to live in the United States, but you will never be able to get another
[00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:24.780]   citizenship without that birth certificate from the United States.
[00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:29.280]   You'll never be able to get a third citizenship, a fourth citizenship.
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:32.340]   You'll never be able to get multiple governments on your side.
[00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:35.580]   And I think that that's the reason I have emphasized so much what I've emphasized in
[00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:44.460]   international escape plan stuff, is that I'm pretty persuaded that governments do not respect
[00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:47.220]   citizens, they only respect other governments.
[00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:53.260]   And so the most important thing is to get other governments on your side, not to try
[00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:58.620]   to be the person going up against the government, especially when you're one out of 500, one
[00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:04.680]   out of 1,000 perhaps, maybe that's too much, maybe it's one out of 500 or one out of 300
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:06.980]   in terms of you against them.
[00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:14.780]   Because almost any kind of attack track that you take, almost any path of resistance that
[00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:21.100]   you take against tyranny, if you're one out of 100, then all of the fellow citizens are
[00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:25.460]   going to line up and do everything they can to help the government squash you.
[00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:31.300]   And so I just don't think – what I decided on is that that pathway of resistance, while
[00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:36.700]   I respect you and anyone else who does it for doing it, I don't think that pathway
[00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:41.340]   of resistance is the most fruitful, which is why I've not kind of encouraged it.
[00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:44.100]   So those are just some thoughts for you to think about.
[00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:46.500]   As I say, I don't know the answer to your specific question.
[00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:50.220]   Go ahead and give your thought, your response, and then go with your second question, please.
[00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:51.220]   Yeah.
[00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:52.220]   Thank you.
[00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:53.220]   I appreciate your thoughts.
[00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:55.420]   And it's a lot to think about.
[00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:58.060]   And I think I tend to agree with you.
[00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:02.300]   The second question was about a whole life insurance policy.
[00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:08.520]   And I think it probably would suit more of like a consultation call sometime.
[00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:16.020]   So the one question I have instead is, didn't you do a podcast about men's values, and
[00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:17.020]   is that still available?
[00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:22.460]   Is that something that's still out there?
[00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:25.740]   Was it with your father or with somebody in your family?
[00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:26.740]   Right.
[00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:27.740]   I did.
[00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:28.740]   Yes.
[00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:29.740]   Encouraging Christian Fathers is what that is called.
[00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:33.860]   It's a podcast that I did for quite a while with my own father.
[00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:37.760]   And I haven't updated it in several years, but I'm intending to update it again soon.
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:39.860]   But it's still available wherever you listen to podcasts.
[00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:41.420]   It's called Encouraging Christian Fathers.
[00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:42.420]   Great.
[00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:43.420]   I will check it out.
[00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:44.420]   All right.
[00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:45.420]   That's it.
[00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:46.420]   Thank you so much.
[00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:47.420]   Thanks.
[00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:48.420]   It was good to hear from you.
[00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:51.620]   And may you have strength and courage and wisdom as you continue to fight for your daughter's
[00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:52.620]   life.
[00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:53.620]   Jason in Kentucky.
[00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:54.620]   Welcome to the show.
[00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:55.620]   How can I serve you today?
[00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:56.620]   Hi, Joshua.
[00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:57.620]   Greetings.
[00:20:57.620 --> 00:20:58.620]   So we arrived at the family camp.
[00:20:58.620 --> 00:20:59.620]   Wonderful.
[00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:08.280]   And you asked me to call in with my question.
[00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:09.280]   Yes.
[00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:12.980]   So I got a chance today to do that.
[00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:17.960]   So kind of a spinning off of the first caller's concern about receiving a social security
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:18.960]   number at birth.
[00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:29.100]   So I'm actually calling about, you kind of surprised me a few episodes back about UTMA.
[00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:37.160]   And we started having this conversation about how I actually feel like UTMAs are, I think,
[00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:40.080]   just greatly overlooked, really undervalued.
[00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:48.400]   And that there is a lot that parents, if they're engaged in it, can do with the UTMA.
[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:52.920]   And maybe for context for those who don't know, that being like a universal transfer
[00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:59.460]   to minors, where that account belongs to the child, but there needs to be a custodian who
[00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:04.840]   sees it as a parent who's legally kind of running that account, administering the account
[00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:09.400]   until the owner becomes a majority.
[00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:17.600]   And so, yeah, I wanted to make my case for why I am enthusiastic about it and kind of
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:18.600]   see what you think.
[00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:19.600]   I'm so glad that you called in.
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:22.840]   So let me just state what I have said previously for context.
[00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:25.360]   And then I want to hear your counter case.
[00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:32.120]   So the UTMA account, Uniform Transfer to Minors Act and UGMA accounts, is a custodial account
[00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:38.000]   that an individual can put money into for the benefit of a minor.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.600]   And then that allows the minor to receive money.
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:43.680]   And there's generally no tax consequences to it.
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:49.160]   It just sits in the account for them until they are a legal adult, which is usually 18
[00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:50.560]   years old.
[00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:54.320]   And then at the age of 18, they now can use the money, they can do whatever they want
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:56.960]   with the money, and it's freely theirs.
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:02.520]   And what I stated, as far as my position, is that I'm skeptical of UTMA accounts.
[00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:07.320]   While I think I could design a circumstance in which I think they're the best they are,
[00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:12.600]   I could probably design something where they're useful, especially if we get into ownership
[00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:19.800]   rules and we have very specific needs from a tax and ownership perspective, then it could
[00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:20.800]   be useful.
[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:29.000]   But my big concern is that it doesn't allow the giver of assets to control the money once
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.400]   the child is an adult.
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:37.840]   And so you've got a drug addict, loser son who turns 18 and all of a sudden has full
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:42.160]   control of the money, and he can do whatever he wants with it now, and it's enabling bad
[00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:44.440]   decisions.
[00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:48.320]   And the rebuttal that people usually give is, "Well, that's only if he knows about it."
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:53.160]   And my point is that you have a fiduciary duty to inform him about it, and so now you're
[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:57.840]   creating a scenario in which the minor knows that, "I'm going to have access to money,"
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:23:59.960]   and you don't have the ability to pull it back.
[00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:04.160]   So that was the basic argument that I present generally when I'm asked about it, and now
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:05.640]   I want to hear your rebuttal.
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:09.920]   Tell us kind of what you love about the UTMA and why you think it's so useful.
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:22.720]   Yeah, and I agree that it's definitely a risk, and for that reason, I would discourage someone
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:30.160]   from having like $100,000 in the UTMA or some amount of money of substantial value because
[00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:32.240]   that risk is too great.
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:37.480]   But basically what I've done with our kids, I mentioned the social security number because
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:42.440]   as soon as they were born and we got the social security card in the mail, the first thing
[00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:49.600]   I did was open UTMA accounts for each of them and put in a little bit of money and bought
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:51.280]   a few stocks for them.
[00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:57.440]   And so they're one month old and can't talk, but they already own some assets.
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:04.440]   And for me, it's not about trying to pick the greatest stocks in the world or to make
[00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:08.400]   them millionaires before they actually do not want them to be millionaires before they
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:14.780]   turn 18, unless they earn it themselves, but it's just about kind of instilling the value
[00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:22.360]   of ownership and for them to, as they grow up and as they become capable of understanding
[00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:30.120]   a little bit of what does it mean to own something, what does it mean to, what do companies do?
[00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:36.720]   For example, if it could be an easy choice of things like gaming companies or things
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:42.960]   that kids are involved in, they engage with, that they can relate to it.
[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:49.200]   And as they get older to kind of teach them, okay, here's what you own, here's what that
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:55.600]   does and what that means, and here's how that can benefit you in the future.
[00:25:55.600 --> 00:26:02.320]   And then, of course, especially when you get into those years, like around 10 to 12 years
[00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:07.240]   of age where they can start to, when they start to have interest and they start to emerge
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:13.800]   with their talent to say, okay, here's some funds that so far have just been invested
[00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:20.640]   in stocks and that's fine, but we can take this and I can help you as the responsible
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:26.240]   party and to say, what would you like to do, what are some things you could explore?
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:30.580]   And it might be spending it on a plane ticket to go to a certain country they would love
[00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:36.040]   to see, or it might be starting a business that might be, we'll see what it is as their
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:39.960]   interests emerge, but to kind of use it as something that's kind of like the opportunity
[00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:40.960]   file.
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:46.680]   And I envision something like between five to 10,000, as far as like a dollar amount
[00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:48.200]   in my head.
[00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:54.960]   And it's enough to do something really cool with, but it's not too much money.
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:27:01.400]   And then, and essentially the goal is to use it well before they reach age of majority.
[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:07.840]   So we never worry about them being irresponsible with it, that then it gets used probably before
[00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:15.080]   they even start to drive, and so that's kind of the goal, the game plan.
[00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:19.880]   And that's kind of where I see the radical side of it, that it kind of becomes the opportunity
[00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:24.440]   file where I have a reason to teach them about those things because they have that.
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:29.920]   And it really is theirs, it legally is theirs, but then we can transform it into something
[00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:36.800]   even more valuable with those experiences they have, if it goes the way I envision it.
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:39.440]   So I'm curious what your thoughts are.
[00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:42.640]   I can see the argument, and I think it's a good one.
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:50.320]   And so the first distinction I would make is there's a couple reasons why the UTMA,
[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:56.560]   in what you're describing, why the UTMA is an appropriate scenario.
[00:27:56.560 --> 00:28:03.720]   First, in what you're describing, you're not trying to accumulate significant assets.
[00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:10.080]   You're not trying to accumulate $150,000 for a college education and do that in a UTMA
[00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:11.080]   account.
[00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:16.320]   And so if we compare the UTMA against something like a 529 account, if somebody's goal is
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:23.800]   to accumulate a six-figure sum for the child's future benefit, I would say a 529 account
[00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:32.920]   is usually going to be a superior choice because what it allows the parent to do is to retain
[00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:37.480]   control over the money, and it is tax-advantaged.
[00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:41.760]   One of the downsides of the UTMA account is it's subject to the kiddie tax.
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:49.640]   So any taxable earnings in the account are taxed, the first, what is it, $2,500, I think?
[00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:56.840]   First $2,500 go to the child and normally would have a 0% tax rate.
[00:28:56.840 --> 00:29:03.120]   But beyond $2,500 of taxable income in the account, unearned income, that's taxed at
[00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:06.740]   the parent's marginal tax bracket.
[00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:10.800]   So due to the kiddie tax rules, that's why UTMA accounts are not appropriate tax shelters
[00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:15.160]   for wealthy parents who are trying to transfer assets to their child to get them out of the
[00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:19.200]   parent's taxable assets to lower the tax rate.
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:23.520]   You can't because the assets are going to be taxed at the parent's highest marginal
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:24.520]   rate.
[00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:28.640]   I would argue that at least be the child's money that's paying the tax, but anyway, ignore
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:29.640]   that.
[00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:36.000]   So for significant funds, for a six-figure sum, a 529 account would be generally a superior
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   account.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:42.440]   Then the other account that we would usually look to would be something like a Roth account.
[00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:51.200]   And so a Roth account could accomplish a similar benefit of a sense of ownership and a similar
[00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:55.440]   benefit to a sense of ownership, but the Roth account requires earned income in order to
[00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:56.440]   start.
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:30:00.960]   And you're not going to be generating absent baby modeling, genuine baby modeling.
[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:03.820]   You're not generating earned income for a one-year-old.
[00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:09.440]   So the Roth account really can't be started until a later time in the child's name.
[00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:11.360]   So you're not getting those same benefits.
[00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:16.200]   Plus the downside of a Roth account is you're teaching the child that this is for your retirement
[00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:20.520]   and you're not getting any of those current benefits of, "Hey, I'm really into gaming
[00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:24.000]   right now, so I'm going to buy these game stocks and I'm going to spend the money on
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.600]   a really great trip abroad."
[00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:31.560]   You can do all of that with a UTMA account when the child is a minor, but you can't do
[00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:37.720]   that with a Roth IRA because it's a retirement account that's generally seen for retirement.
[00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:42.000]   And then the other important thing is that you're not just doing this with physical money
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:47.920]   or with a simple – you're not doing this with physical money or physical assets.
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:50.800]   You're trying to establish the ownership of securities.
[00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:54.840]   And so if you're going to establish ownership of securities, you need an actual legal title
[00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:59.920]   to put on the account, unlike just money that can be earned from flipping bicycles and selling
[00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:01.920]   lemonade and those kinds of things.
[00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:05.640]   And then finally, you're trying to genuinely instill a sense of ownership and you're trying
[00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:07.480]   to say, "This is your money.
[00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:11.180]   I may have seeded the account for you, but this is your money.
[00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:13.520]   This is your money that you control.
[00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:17.880]   I'm just the custodian on it, but you're the one who makes the decisions and you can gain
[00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:19.200]   access to this money.
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:24.120]   And so if you can invest effectively and grow the balance, you can go ahead and use this
[00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:25.120]   money.
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:28.240]   This is your money and you can do whatever you want with it, but – and it's legally
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:33.440]   your money, genuinely legally your money, but it's not constrained in a retirement account
[00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:36.920]   and it's available to you without any restrictions.
[00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:40.160]   So I think that with that line of thinking, I believe you're absolutely correct.
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:43.440]   The UTMA account is your superior option for that.
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:44.440]   Yeah.
[00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:49.240]   I especially think about some of these founders and people have been really – you think
[00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:54.680]   about almost anybody, like a Bill Gates type of person who sees jobs, a lot of their skills
[00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:55.680]   emerged in teenagehood.
[00:31:55.680 --> 00:32:02.800]   I think that's probably true for a lot of regular folks too, and so that's kind of
[00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:08.560]   a – when I think about generational planning, that's kind of what I have in my head, empowering
[00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:09.560]   that to some degree.
[00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:10.560]   Right.
[00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:13.680]   Or maybe using it for a Roth IRA, if they want to do that.
[00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:14.680]   Totally.
[00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:15.680]   Totally.
[00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:20.400]   And what I'm emphasizing, and I think you're agreeing with, is this is being used as a
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:27.000]   training tool, not as a financial, exclusively financial tool.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.600]   So we're not trying to reduce taxes.
[00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:32.220]   We're not trying to move assets, move ownership.
[00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:38.400]   We're trying to use the laws that exist to establish ownership for a minor so that he
[00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:46.440]   can trade stocks or some variation of that and know that it's his money that he has
[00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:52.200]   full control over, that he gets full access to prior to 18 with your approval, and full
[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:56.040]   access to whether he has your approval or not after the age of 18.
[00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:59.100]   And it's not primarily a tax tool.
[00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:04.100]   It's a training tool investing into the child's sense of ownership so that he'll take interest
[00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:06.280]   in the companies that he interacts with.
[00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:07.280]   Yeah.
[00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:08.280]   Yeah.
[00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:09.280]   Yeah.
[00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:10.280]   You're exactly right.
[00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:11.280]   Yeah.
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:12.280]   Yeah.
[00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:13.280]   All right.
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:14.280]   You've persuaded me.
[00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:15.280]   I agree.
[00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:16.640]   I think that your use case is ideal, and I agree.
[00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:17.880]   I think that...
[00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:21.880]   Look out for Asian majority, be careful with that.
[00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:22.880]   Right.
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:23.880]   Right.
[00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:27.840]   I think that what's evident to me from talking it through with you is that my brain automatically
[00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:30.860]   reverts to large numbers.
[00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:34.640]   And I need to be careful when I'm answering a question about a UTMA account, I need to
[00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:39.920]   be careful to specify what amount of money are we talking about here?
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:45.760]   Because when someone says, "I want to set aside money for my child," I'm automatically
[00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:52.120]   mentally interpreting that to mean, "I want to set aside $100,000 to $250,000 for a child's
[00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:53.800]   education."
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:34:00.160]   And I'm saying, "Well, this is an inferior option when compared to a 529 account, or
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:04.720]   a Roth IRA account for the long-term, this is an inferior option for that."
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:09.160]   But what I should do is I should be more careful to say, "What amount of money are we talking
[00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:10.520]   about and what's the goal?"
[00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:16.320]   Because the two factors that you've described of, "Hey, we're talking $3,000 or $9,000,
[00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:20.800]   whatever it grows to, we're talking modest amounts, and we want the child to have the
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:26.040]   confidence of ownership, and we just need some way of titling the account so that he
[00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:30.720]   can actually buy and sell and trade and do all that stuff on a brokerage account or other
[00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:35.440]   exchange in some way," then I think that that makes absolute sense.
[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:41.880]   And I need to be careful that I don't automatically just substitute six-figure sums when somebody
[00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:43.440]   may not be intending that.
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:44.440]   Yeah.
[00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:50.360]   And that's kind of what surprised me a little bit, yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
[00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:57.560]   So, it's good to reconcile our definition of terms, right?
[00:34:57.560 --> 00:34:58.560]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:34:58.560 --> 00:34:59.560]   Well, awesome.
[00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:00.560]   I love that you called in.
[00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:02.800]   Anything else you want to cover, Jason, before I go on to the next caller?
[00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:04.960]   That's everything for today.
[00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:05.960]   Awesome.
[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:07.720]   Well, I thank you again for coming to the family camp.
[00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:12.120]   I loved interacting with you there, and look forward to connecting with you again soon.
[00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:16.680]   It's great to be able to put names to faces, to voices on the phone.
[00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:17.680]   Lauren in Illinois.
[00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:18.680]   Welcome to the show.
[00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:19.680]   How can I serve you today, Lauren?
[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:20.680]   Hi, Joshua.
[00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:21.680]   Thanks for taking my call.
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:22.680]   My pleasure.
[00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:29.520]   Well, first, I wanted to just share an impact that your podcast has had on me.
[00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:38.440]   I was just looking it up, and you released the Friday Q&A last year, March 6, 2023, about
[00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:47.560]   birth tourism, and you talked a lot about just the physical explanation of birthing
[00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:55.360]   and utilizing midwives and just different, you know, you just explained very well what
[00:35:55.360 --> 00:36:01.320]   the process of birthing was like, and it got me thinking, and I actually got pregnant later
[00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:07.600]   on last year and ended up giving birth at a birthing center with midwives.
[00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:12.520]   It was, like, the most beautiful experience, and I just wanted to say thank you, because
[00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:15.320]   I don't think I would have gone down the route that I did.
[00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:19.520]   I probably would have entertained using midwives, but would have probably done so in a more
[00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:24.040]   clinical setting, like at a hospital or something like that, and instead I went with a birthing
[00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:28.960]   center that had a lot less intervention, and it was just, it was amazing, and I wanted
[00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:35.160]   to share it because I know that positive birth stories are few and far between when it comes
[00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:36.160]   to media.
[00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:37.160]   Yes.
[00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:42.520]   Because the media likes to share the scary stuff, all the unknowns, and I think, especially
[00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:48.440]   as a first-time mom going into it, there were a lot of unknowns, but having gone through
[00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:53.280]   it now, it was just, like, the most beautiful experience, and I know that it was the case
[00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:58.920]   because there were less interventions, there was just, you know, there were medical professionals
[00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:04.600]   involved, but they were there to do it in the most natural route possible, and I was
[00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:05.600]   just so thankful for it.
[00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:06.600]   So I wanted to share that with you first.
[00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:07.600]   I am thrilled that you...
[00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:08.600]   Are you ready for some hot stuff?
[00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:09.600]   Oh yeah.
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:10.600]   The WNBA is back on ION.
[00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:11.600]   The action is on Friday night.
[00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:12.600]   Fakes the pass and scores.
[00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:13.600]   The spotlight is on the players.
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:14.600]   Back to back buckets.
[00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:15.600]   A bona fide star.
[00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:16.600]   And the crowd is on edge.
[00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:17.600]   This game is on fire.
[00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:18.600]   You can't ask for more than that.
[00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:19.600]   The WNBA is on Friday night, starting May 17th.
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:20.120]   Find out more at WNBA.com.
[00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:44.560]   First of all, you've shared that, and that you've had that experience, and I love hearing
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:49.520]   just a few murmurs in the background of your little baby, and it makes all the difference
[00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:50.520]   in the world.
[00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:56.200]   So I'll just comment on what you said, just to say thank you for that.
[00:37:56.200 --> 00:38:04.940]   And it's important, because one of my goals, one of my current life goals, is to do anything
[00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:13.160]   possible to equip mothers and fathers to have as many children as they want to have.
[00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:18.740]   And I think that that's something that we can change, especially if we approach it holistically.
[00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:23.300]   And while it's not particularly common for a financial planner to talk about birthing,
[00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:27.800]   I think that there's some things, some of the reasons I do it is because I think there's
[00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:31.000]   some things that we can improve about it.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:36.920]   And our culture has always, not always, but our culture has isolated birthing, and it
[00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:49.100]   has created fear in the hearts of women and prospective mothers all across the culture.
[00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:55.300]   And I'm convinced that that's largely a psychiatric condition that is unnecessary.
[00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:57.740]   It doesn't have to be that way.
[00:38:57.740 --> 00:39:03.820]   And if you listen to experienced midwives who have crossed the globe, there are cultures
[00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:09.180]   in which giving birth is just perceived as totally normal, generally considered to be
[00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:12.820]   broadly painless, straightforward, all of that.
[00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:16.100]   And so I think that we want to hold two things really carefully.
[00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:19.980]   We want to hold that birthing is a normal and natural process.
[00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:22.220]   Being pregnant is not a disease.
[00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:27.340]   And then simultaneously, even as with the first caller, before you jumped on, simultaneously
[00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:32.220]   recognize that we need to be grateful for the incredible medical technology that we
[00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:36.980]   have that saves the lives of countless mothers and babies all in.
[00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:40.980]   And before you jumped on, the first caller, they had been planning on the birth of their
[00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:46.140]   first baby and planning for a natural birth, and the baby came at 26 weeks.
[00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:49.420]   And the baby's in the NICU, she's doing okay, but she came at 26 weeks.
[00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:54.160]   And so I love that we have both of these calls on here because both of them are important.
[00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:57.340]   We want to have good medical supervision.
[00:39:57.340 --> 00:40:04.180]   We want to have good, modern, informed, highly qualified medical care.
[00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:08.900]   And we want to do it in a human context that recognizes that the needs of the mother are
[00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:11.060]   really, really important.
[00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:17.500]   And as you are describing from the words that if a mother's birthing experience, especially
[00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:26.820]   her first baby, if a mother's first baby birthing experience can be a beautiful, treasured
[00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:36.420]   memory for her, it transforms her initial days with her new baby, and it transforms
[00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:44.380]   the family's experience of childbirth in an enormous way based upon that first initial
[00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:46.820]   experience being beautiful.
[00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:49.440]   And there are being something that's treasured.
[00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:53.920]   And that's what I try to encourage people, like for my wife and me, probably our most
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:41:03.820]   intimate moments together as a couple have been the births of our five children, because
[00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:05.920]   they were beautiful and it was just us.
[00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:10.580]   It's an intense emotional experience that is beautiful and rewarding.
[00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:18.660]   And so I wouldn't trade that for, unless it was necessary for the medical needs of a child
[00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:22.180]   or my wife, I wouldn't trade that for anything.
[00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:27.700]   And yet those outcomes are much more probable when you're in an environment where that's
[00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:35.700]   seen as a goal that's worthy of care to be held alongside proper medical care.
[00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:37.180]   And midwives are highly trained.
[00:41:37.180 --> 00:41:39.140]   They're highly trained to what to watch out for.
[00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:44.140]   They're there to do a job, and that frees you in order to focus on the experience and
[00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:45.420]   you can have great outcomes.
[00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:49.380]   And so I want to increase birth rates in the world.
[00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:56.340]   And there's a good friend of mine that I just consider as almost a perfect foil to this,
[00:41:56.340 --> 00:42:01.700]   that good friend of mine, both he and she wanted to have lots of babies.
[00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:04.280]   And they got married, they had their first baby.
[00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:07.140]   They always thought they would have lots and lots of children.
[00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:09.540]   Her pregnancy was so difficult.
[00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:11.720]   She was so enormously sick.
[00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:16.980]   And then the childbirth experience was so brutal for her that they said, "That's it.
[00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:17.980]   We're done.
[00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:18.980]   One child and done."
[00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:23.480]   And I don't think in her case that there's any...
[00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:27.980]   I'm not arguing that anything could have been done differently in her case that would have
[00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:28.980]   made it different.
[00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:30.220]   So that's not what I'm saying.
[00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:36.180]   I'm using it as an example to say that if mothers can have birthing experiences that
[00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:41.260]   are gentle and that are warm and that are fulfilling and that are intimate and that
[00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:47.860]   create precious memories while they do the hard work of birthing the baby, then it can
[00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:55.900]   completely transform their attitudes towards motherhood, our societies, we can do it better.
[00:42:55.900 --> 00:43:05.540]   And we can do it better while holding on to the twin necessaries of a world-class experience
[00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:10.660]   for the mother and for the baby and for the father, as well as proper up-to-date medical
[00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:11.660]   care.
[00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:12.660]   So that's why I care about it.
[00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:14.900]   And it thrills my heart to no end to hear your story.
[00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:15.900]   Thank you.
[00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:17.460]   Yeah, of course.
[00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:18.660]   And thank you for sharing all that.
[00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:19.660]   And I totally agree.
[00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:21.740]   And we'll just call out for the other listeners.
[00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:27.340]   One of the things that we look for in our medical care was that our midwives...
[00:43:27.340 --> 00:43:31.540]   My husband's perspective was that he was, of course, most worried about me and wanted
[00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:36.420]   to be comfortable that I could get the appropriate medical care as needed.
[00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:40.980]   And so one of the things that comforted him was our birthing center had done test drills
[00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:41.980]   to the hospital.
[00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:45.100]   It was six minutes door to door.
[00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:49.220]   There were certain birth situations in which they would not deliver, but they had practicing
[00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:50.620]   rights at a local hospital.
[00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:56.700]   So if necessary, they could be our medical care at the hospital.
[00:43:56.700 --> 00:44:02.500]   And we would also have all the other equipment and doctors around that were necessary.
[00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:04.300]   So that was super helpful.
[00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:09.020]   And then I'll call out with regards to the increasing birth rate.
[00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:12.740]   One of the comments my husband made when we were younger was just that he wanted to have
[00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:17.420]   three children and his reason being was that it was above the national average.
[00:44:17.420 --> 00:44:19.580]   And I just kind of discounted that at the time.
[00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:25.140]   But through listening to your podcast, I've actually bought into it and seen that perspective
[00:44:25.140 --> 00:44:29.780]   a little bit more and have truly considered it also in addition to having a very positive
[00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:30.780]   birth experience.
[00:44:30.780 --> 00:44:31.780]   Good.
[00:44:31.780 --> 00:44:34.820]   Take them one at a time, one at a time, and then work it out between you guys.
[00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:35.820]   But that's amazing.
[00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:36.820]   Exactly.
[00:44:36.820 --> 00:44:37.820]   How else can I serve you today?
[00:44:37.820 --> 00:44:45.300]   So I did have a financial question, and this is pretty laughable, but I interviewed for
[00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:48.740]   a position two weeks postpartum.
[00:44:48.740 --> 00:44:54.820]   You are a warrior, warrior through and through.
[00:44:54.820 --> 00:45:02.300]   It was definitely a God thing, and I got a job offer, have accepted it.
[00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:05.700]   And so we're going to be moving to Florida.
[00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:11.100]   I currently live in Texas with my husband and our now six-week-old.
[00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:17.340]   And we are considering whether or not we should sell our house or rent it out.
[00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:20.900]   And I just wanted to get some thoughts and your perspective on it.
[00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:26.940]   So the reason why we're considering renting the house out is we have a really fantastic
[00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:28.340]   interest rate on our mortgage.
[00:45:28.340 --> 00:45:31.980]   We went into it, we got a 15-year mortgage.
[00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:39.700]   This is back in 2017, and we've paid off a decent chunk, I think, like 40% of the mortgage
[00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:45.060]   is paid off, or 40% of the house value when we bought it was paid off.
[00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:48.660]   So we have 11 more years on it.
[00:45:48.660 --> 00:45:54.180]   I'm sorry, we refinanced, so that wouldn't make sense unless I told you that we refinanced.
[00:45:54.180 --> 00:46:00.420]   But we have 11 more years on our mortgage, 60% more to pay off.
[00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:03.960]   Considering renting it out, it is a large house.
[00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:09.980]   We bought a forever home and expected to stay here and be in it for a while, so it's quite
[00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:10.980]   large.
[00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:14.060]   We'd have to rent it out for a lot of money because it's a six-bedroom home.
[00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:18.700]   We would probably need to rent it out for at least $4,500 to break even.
[00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:25.700]   We're looking at, I think the ideal number would be $6,000 versus selling our home and
[00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:30.540]   then either renting or buying in the market in Florida.
[00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:35.420]   And of course, we have a really high interest rate that we'd be picking up, so probably
[00:46:35.420 --> 00:46:36.420]   in the 7% range.
[00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:40.100]   So I just wanted to get your thoughts and things to consider.
[00:46:40.100 --> 00:46:45.220]   We've done a lot of math and spreadsheets and all the things behind it, and we can make
[00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:48.180]   a case based off of assumptions towards either.
[00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:49.180]   Okay.
[00:46:49.180 --> 00:46:54.340]   So just to clarify, given your expected income in Florida, given the costs of buying a house
[00:46:54.340 --> 00:46:59.580]   that's appropriate for you, you think that you could afford to keep the house in Texas,
[00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:04.540]   rent it out and simultaneously purchase another house to live in in Florida, is that right?
[00:47:04.540 --> 00:47:05.540]   Yeah.
[00:47:05.540 --> 00:47:06.540]   Okay.
[00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:11.900]   Well, then if that's the case, then it's fairly simple and straightforward.
[00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:24.700]   And it comes down to how your experience is as a landlord of the benefits as compared
[00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:31.660]   to the frustration and difficulty and how much you bristle at the extra work.
[00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:38.940]   The more property that you own and control, the more potential wealth you have in the
[00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:45.900]   long run based upon increases in property value and based upon the fact that your tenant
[00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:48.200]   can pay off your mortgage for you.
[00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:56.340]   So from a purely financial perspective, everyone who wants to be rich should go out as quickly
[00:47:56.340 --> 00:48:03.280]   as possible, purchase as much property as you can finance, get people in place to pay
[00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:09.140]   off your mortgages for you, and then sit back and hold that for a very long time.
[00:48:09.140 --> 00:48:13.540]   The fastest way to become a millionaire in the United States with real estate is just
[00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:17.380]   go borrow a million dollars and get your tenants to pay it off for you.
[00:48:17.380 --> 00:48:23.380]   And so that's what you would do if you go ahead and purchase an additional home in Florida
[00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:26.340]   for you to live in and keep your Texas property.
[00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:33.160]   And that is that you're always going to be better off because of owning more property.
[00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:40.000]   Let's say the house in Texas is $400,000 and the house in Florida is $600,000.
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:44.160]   So if you own both of those and you have a million dollars worth of property and the
[00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:51.120]   property increases in value by 10%, there's an increase in your net worth of $100,000
[00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:55.800]   as compared to if you only own a $600,000 house in Florida and there's an increase in
[00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:58.720]   your net worth of $60,000.
[00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:06.060]   So conceptually, for those who want to build wealth quickly, you should set a goal of purchasing
[00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:11.320]   as much property as possible, as quickly as possible, and then fill that property with
[00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:15.200]   tenants and setting those tenants up to pay off your property for you.
[00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:18.880]   I've talked about this in doing it in a strategic way.
[00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:23.160]   So let's say that you're very strategic about building wealth with real estate.
[00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:24.160]   What would you do?
[00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:28.560]   Well, at 18 years old, you would go out, you would have a job, you would be financeable,
[00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:32.860]   and you would go and purchase a house.
[00:49:32.860 --> 00:49:37.880]   You would fill the house with tenants, roommates, to pay your mortgage payment.
[00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:41.160]   You would repeat it at 20, and you would fill the house with roommates to pay your mortgage
[00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:42.160]   tenant.
[00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:44.200]   So now you've moved on to the second house.
[00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:45.680]   You would repeat it at 23.
[00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:46.680]   You go and buy a house.
[00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:49.760]   This time you go ahead and live in it for a year yourself.
[00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:53.520]   Your first two houses are rented out to multiple tenants, college students.
[00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:55.720]   Then your third house, you put another tenant in it.
[00:49:55.720 --> 00:49:59.040]   And by 25, if you could own five houses, that'd be amazing.
[00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:03.640]   Then you go ahead and move into your forever house, and you just make sure that those tenants
[00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:06.920]   are continually paying down your mortgages for you until all the houses are own debt
[00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:10.360]   free and you're a multimillionaire with real estate.
[00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:12.160]   That's a perfectly viable plan.
[00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:13.160]   All right.
[00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:16.400]   So now that we've extolled the virtues of the plan, what is the downside?
[00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:21.400]   Well, the downside is simply that it takes work to deal with houses.
[00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:28.680]   It takes work to deal with tenants, and that work is not always fun or even palatable for
[00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:30.280]   many people.
[00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:32.800]   Many people don't want to deal with it.
[00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:35.800]   They don't want to deal with dealing with tenants.
[00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:40.600]   They don't want to deal with fixing the house up when the previous tenant trashes the kitchen
[00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:42.600]   and fixing all the stuff.
[00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:48.720]   Now you might have a big advantage that if you could rent this house fairly easily, you
[00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:53.560]   would be dealing with a higher end tenant, and that may be an advantage for you that
[00:50:53.560 --> 00:50:55.120]   perhaps that tenant is better.
[00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:56.200]   I don't know.
[00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:59.800]   The point is simply that real estate tenants are not time free.
[00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:04.200]   So if you can do it and you're willing to do it, or you can try it and see what your
[00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:10.800]   experience is, then it's probably better for you to keep both houses and try it.
[00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:17.240]   If you find that it's not working for you, you don't like managing the tenants, or this
[00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:22.080]   house just doesn't rent well, you have so many vacancies that you can never recoup your
[00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:26.600]   money, or it's going to sink you financially because of those vacancies, then you would
[00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:27.600]   say, "You know what?
[00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:31.240]   I need to go ahead and not pursue this path anymore."
[00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:33.880]   But basically as I see it, it's as simple as that.
[00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:38.840]   All the rest of the stuff with interest rates and expected returns and all of that, it's
[00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:45.600]   all interesting and it could be factored in, but at its core, I think those two things
[00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:51.280]   I've said, the pro and the con, cover 80% of the decision.
[00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:56.840]   The pro is if you want to build wealth, a good way to build wealth is to acquire as
[00:51:56.840 --> 00:52:01.400]   much property as you can finance, and then make your tenants pay it off for you.
[00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:06.360]   And the con is it's not time free, and it could sink you financially if you don't have
[00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:07.520]   enough margin.
[00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:11.200]   It does take time and energy to deal with tenants, and it's got to be worth it to you
[00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:13.640]   in the long run to put that time and energy in.
[00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:16.520]   But if you're willing to do it, and you find that, "Hey, we can rent this house okay.
[00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:17.520]   We can get good tenants.
[00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:20.920]   It's not vacant too much," then yeah, you're better off keeping both houses as far as I'm
[00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:21.920]   concerned.
[00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:22.920]   Alright.
[00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:23.920]   Awesome.
[00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:24.920]   I really appreciate that.
[00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:25.920]   Yeah.
[00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:26.920]   Definitely a lot of things to consider.
[00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:27.920]   Right.
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:33.560]   It's the challenge of whether or not the vacancies will be the make or break of the decision.
[00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:39.200]   But one of the things I had shared with my husband is at least trying to rent is not
[00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:43.200]   a permanent decision versus selling that's very permanent, "We're never going to get
[00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:48.560]   this house back," so something to continue to discuss and consider.
[00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:52.320]   And I think that if the money works based upon your income, your savings, and all that
[00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:55.880]   stuff for you to keep both houses, I think it'll be a nice thing for you to have too
[00:52:55.880 --> 00:52:57.340]   as a backup plan.
[00:52:57.340 --> 00:53:00.800]   You may get to Florida, this job is great for the first six months, and then it just
[00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:02.440]   isn't great after that.
[00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:05.880]   And so being able to turn around and go back to the house that you know you love, the forever
[00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:11.200]   home that you have in Texas, that could be a great nice thing to have available to you
[00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:13.080]   as an option as well.
[00:53:13.080 --> 00:53:18.600]   And the good thing is that both of these areas are in high growth areas, good economic growth,
[00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:22.920]   good reasons to expect that real estate is good, good reasons to expect that you'd be
[00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:26.520]   able to find tenants who want to rent the property, and it's just going to come down
[00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:32.000]   to does this property rent easily enough that we can find tenants that we don't have too
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:33.000]   many vacancies.
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:34.680]   And I don't know, right?
[00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:41.400]   Higher end, I mean $6,000 a month is not super high end but it's certainly high end.
[00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:46.220]   It could be, it can be better and it can be worse depending on what the local market provides
[00:53:46.220 --> 00:53:47.440]   and what the competition is.
[00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:49.720]   So try it out, see what see what happens.
[00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:53.000]   Thanks, I'll report back.
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:54.000]   I love that you do.
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:55.920]   Thank you so much.
[00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:58.760]   And with that, we conclude our Friday Q&A show.
[00:53:58.760 --> 00:54:00.560]   Thank you guys very much for listening.
[00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:04.520]   I love that you love it when you guys call in and update us on situations.
[00:54:04.520 --> 00:54:09.400]   So we had, I think, two callers there that talking about past commentary and I love it.
[00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:12.440]   If you'd like to join me on one of these shows next week, you can do that by going
