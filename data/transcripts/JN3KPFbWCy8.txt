[00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:53.640]   This is a civilizational threat. Right now, I could be wrong, but I think the current probability of nuclear war is quite low. But there are a lot of nukes pointed at us. And we have a lot of nukes pointed at other people. They're still there. Nobody's put their guns away.

They left in the middle of winter with no coats and ran like ever no food no coast no water and just ran like hell and ran west and by sure like they his brother found like a bicycle or something and and then just cycled west as fast as he could and found a US patrol.

[00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:31.940]  ..
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:39:02.300]  æ‰‹ I think it could push towards that direction almost like theoretical physics discoveries. If an AI cannot figure out new physics, it's clearly not equal to humans, let alone nor has surpassed humans, because humans have figured out new physics. Physics is just understanding, you know, deepening one's insight into how reality works. And then, then there's engineering, which is inventing things that have never existed. Now, the
[00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:02.300]   The range of possible discoveries is a lot longer than that.
[00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:31.820]   - The range of possibilities for engineering is far greater than for physics. Because, you know, once you figure out the rules of the universe, that's it, you've discovered things that already existed. But from that, you can then build technologies that are really almost limitless in the variety and, you know, once you understand the rules of the game properly. And we do, you know, current physics, we do, at least at a local level, understand how physics works very well.
[00:39:31.820 --> 00:40:01.340]   and how we can develop new technologies, and we do, you know, learn new things that are really almost limitless in the variety and, you know, learn new things that are really almost limitless in the variety and, you know, learn new things that are really almost limitless in the variety and, you know, learn new things that are really almost limitless in the variety and, you know, learn new things that are really almost limitless in the variety and, you know, learn new things that are really good, the degree to predict things is incredibly good. But quantum mechanics is the degree to which quantum mechanics can predict outcomes is incredible. That was my hardest class in college by the way. My senior quantum mechanics class was harder than all of my other classes put together. To get an AI system a large language model to reliably be as quantum mechanics is very difficult.

[00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:20.040]   and maybe AI can pave the path to the discovery of what whatever the hell that thing is. Yeah, what is consciousness? Like what? When you put the atoms in a particular shape? Why are they able to form thoughts and take actions that feelings? And even if it is an illusion? Why is this illusion so compelling? Yeah. Like, how do you why does this illusion exist? Yeah. On what plane does this? This illusion exists?

[00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:17.560]   I'm going to ask you a question.
[00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:46.000]   and you know that you're not, I think, I think, but I probably prefer to at least have seen some archaeological evidence of aliens. But to the best of my knowledge, there is no.
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:46:02.440]   I'm not aware of any evidence of aliens. If they're out there, they're very subtle. We might just be the only consciousness, at least in the galaxy.
[00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:03.440]   And if you look at the history of Earth, for the archaeological record, Earth is about 4.5 billion years old.
[00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:03.440]   If you look at the history of the archaeological record, Earth is about 4.5 billion years old.
[00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:03.440]   Civilization as measured from the first writing is only about 5,000 years old.
[00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:03.440]   civilization as measured from the first writing is only about 5000 years old.
[00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:03.520]   If you look at the history of the history of the ancient Sumerians who aren't around anymore.
[00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:15.520]   We have to give some credit there to the ancient Sumerians who aren't around anymore.
[00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:15.520]   I think it's not around anymore.
[00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:15.520]   I think it's not the history of the ancient Sumerians who aren't around anymore.
[00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:16.000]   I think it's not the ancient Sumerans anymore.
[00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:20.600]   The archaic pre-cuneiform was the first actual symbolic representation, but only about 5000 years ago.
[00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:23.720]   The archaic pre-cuneiform was the first actual symbolic representation, but only about 5000 years ago.
[00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:24.040]   I think that's a good date for when civilization started.
[00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:25.000]   I think that's a good date for when civilization started.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:29.640]   I think that's a good date for when civilization started.
[00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:29.720]   That's one millionth of Earth's existence.
[00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:33.880]   That's one millionth of Earth's existence.

[00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:46.000]   and why we're not aware of it.
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   We're not aware of the information.

[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   Why did it take so long?
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   For one and a half billion years, for the vast majority of the time, there was no life.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   For one and a half billion years, for the vast majority of the time, there was no life.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   There was archaic bacteria for a very long time.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   There was archaic bacteria for a very long time.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   Then mitochondria could capture multicellular life.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   Then mitochondria could capture multicellular life.

[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   Then differentiated the cell cells.

So maybe an interesting answer to the question of determinism versus free will is that if we are in a simulation, the reason that these higher beings would hold the simulation is to see what happens. So they don't know what happens. Otherwise they wouldn't hold the simulation.
[00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:24.320]   Mm-hmm.
[00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:24.320]   So when humans create simulations so that they can see what happens, they don't know what happens. Otherwise they wouldn't hold the simulation.

[00:55:25.620 --> 00:55:27.860]   maybe Diablo was created to see if a

[01:05:30.800 --> 01:06:00.800]   it's not something to take if you're planning on operating, having machinery or trying to solve complex math equations, and it goes on and on. In conclusion, so much a drug, but they can be helpful for those dealing with muscle pain, but it's not without its risks. Pretty good.
[01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:00.800]   It's a muscle relaxant that's been around since the 1950s. It's used to treat muscle pain and discomfort, and it does this by altering the activity between neurons and the spinal cord. Now, so much isn't just a pain reliever. It's also a bit of a sedative. It can make you feel a bit drowsy, so it's not something to take if you're planning on operating, having machinery or trying to solve complex math equations, and it goes on and on. In conclusion, so much a drug, but they can be helpful for those dealing with muscle pain, but it's not without its risks. Pretty good.
[01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:30.820]  , and of course the fun is always use it responsibly in accordance with the advice of a healthcare professional and remember in the end the universe is probably just a giant computer simulation so don't take anything too seriously I love it I love it I love it I love it I love it yeah so it also really nicely includes like the tweets posts on X that are relevant to this which is really cool
[01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:38.840]   it like integrates everything together yeah like the interface is one of the really cool things here yeah it's a great job

[01:18:15.420 --> 01:18:19.020]   I think over 100 regulatory agencies, domestically and internationally. It's a lot. You could fill this room with all the regulations that Tesla has to adhere to for automotive. Same is true for rockets and for, you know, currently the limiting factor for SpaceX for Starship launch is regulatory approval. The FAA has actually given their approval, but we're waiting for Fish and Wildlife to finish their analysis and give their approval.
[01:18:19.060 --> 01:18:35.860]  obedient.
[01:18:35.860 --> 01:18:37.660]   That's why I posted, I want to buy a fish license on.
[01:18:37.660 --> 01:18:38.660]   Which also refers to the Monty Python sketch.
[01:18:38.660 --> 01:18:41.660]   Like, why do you need a license for your fish? I don't know. According to the rules, I'm told you need some sort of fish license or something. We effectively need a fish license to launch a rocket.
[01:18:41.660 --> 01:18:47.660]   And I'm like, wait a second. How did the fish come into this picture?
[01:18:47.660 --> 01:18:47.660]   Yeah.
[01:18:47.660 --> 01:18:47.660]   So, I think that's a big deal.
[01:18:47.660 --> 01:18:47.660]   I think that's a big deal.
[01:18:47.660 --> 01:19:16.300]   I think that's a big deal.

[01:20:12.860 --> 01:20:42.000]  !", that cares about whether you, we would potentially hit a whale in international waters. Now again, you look at the surface of the, like, look at the Pacific and say, what percentage of the Pacific consists of whale? Like, I'll give you a big picture and, like, point out all the whales in this picture. I was like, "I don't see any whales." It's like, basically 0%. And if our rocket does hit a whale, it's extremely unlikely, beyond all belief, that is the, the, fate
[01:20:42.020 --> 01:21:11.180]   fate had it as, as a, a whale has some seriously bad luck. You know, it's the least lucky whale ever. And, I mean, this is quite absurd. The bureaucracy, the bureaucracy of this, however it emerged. Yes, well, I mean, one of the things that's pretty wild is, for launching out of Vandenberg in California, we had to, they were worried about seal procreation, whether the seals would be dismayed by the
[01:21:11.180 --> 01:21:11.180]   Sonic booms.
[01:21:11.220 --> 01:21:40.460]  ,
[01:21:40.460 --> 01:21:41.160]   Now, there have been a lot of rockets launched out of Vandenberg, and the seal population has steadily increased.
[01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:41.160]   So, if anything, rocket booms are an aphrodisiac, based on the evidence, if you correlate rocket launches with seal population. Nonetheless, we were forced to kidnap a seal, strap it to a board, put headphones on the seal, and play sonic booms sounds to it to see if it would be distressed.
[01:21:41.160 --> 01:22:03.240]  ,
[01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:03.340]   I would love to see this. Yeah, I mean, I'm sorry, there's a seal with headphones.
[01:22:03.340 --> 01:22:03.340]   Yes, it's a seal with headphones strapped to a board. And, and like, okay, the amazing part is how calm the seal was.
[01:22:03.340 --> 01:22:03.340]   Yeah, because if I was a seal, I'd be like, this is the end.
[01:22:03.340 --> 01:22:03.340]   Yeah, because if I was a seal, I'd be like, this is the end.
[01:22:03.340 --> 01:22:03.540]   They're definitely gonna eat me.

[01:36:26.020 --> 01:36:28.020]   The whole point is 'cause it funds things.
[01:36:28.020 --> 01:36:31.020]   Like an advertisement that you actually want to see is a big success.
[01:36:31.020 --> 01:36:32.020]   Absolutely.
[01:36:32.020 --> 01:36:41.020]   You, you, you want ads that are, advertising that is, um, if, if, if it's for a product or service that you, that you actually need,

[01:36:41.020 --> 01:37:11.060]   - - -and you need it, it's content.
[01:37:11.060 --> 01:37:11.060]   And then even if it's not something that you need when you need it, if it's at least aesthetically pleasing and entertaining, it could be like a Coca-Cola ad, like, you know, they do, they actually run a lot of great ads on the, on the ex system. And McDonald's does too and, and, you know, so they can do, you can do something that's like, well, this is, this is just a cool thing. And, you know, so, you know, basically the question is just
[01:37:11.060 --> 01:37:11.060]   You know, it's just a question is just a question.
[01:37:11.080 --> 01:37:13.100]   Do you regret seeing it or not?
[01:37:13.100 --> 01:37:14.100]   And if you don't regret seeing it, it's a win.
[01:37:14.100 --> 01:37:26.100]   How do you, so there's a bunch of signals that are incorporated, hearts and reposts, and maybe number of seconds you linger on a post or something like this.
[01:37:26.100 --> 01:37:27.100]   Yeah.
[01:37:27.100 --> 01:37:28.100]   Attention is a big, a big factor.
[01:37:28.100 --> 01:37:29.100]   Attention.
[01:37:29.100 --> 01:37:41.100]   So that's, that's why it's like, it's, it's, it is actually better to do things that are, uh, long form on the system because it's, it's basically telling up how many user seconds.

[01:48:06.060 --> 01:48:09.680]   First off, let's talk about the infamous funding secured tweet.
[01:48:09.680 --> 01:48:13.860]   This is actually different than what he gave me before, which is a bullet point list.
[01:48:13.860 --> 01:48:15.860]   Here is more narrative structure.
[01:48:15.860 --> 01:48:19.900]   "Cybertruck unveiling where he supposedly unbreakable windows."
[01:48:19.900 --> 01:48:19.940]   That's not correct.
[01:48:19.940 --> 01:48:20.040]   That's not correct.
[01:48:20.040 --> 01:48:20.780]   That's not correct. Which part?
[01:48:20.780 --> 01:48:20.860]   Which part?
[01:48:20.860 --> 01:48:20.860]   Which part? Well, the first part, I did actually have the funding secured, and there was a big trial in San Francisco, a big civil trial.
[01:48:20.860 --> 01:48:30.820]   Which part? Well, the first part, I did actually have the funding secured, and there was a big trial in San Francisco a big civil trial.
[01:48:30.820 --> 01:48:30.840]   Well, the first part, I did actually have the funding secured, and there was a big trial in San Francisco, a big civil trial.
[01:48:30.980 --> 01:49:00.040]   And the jury found me not guilty. Unanimous finding of a San Francisco jury.
[01:49:00.040 --> 01:49:00.100]   And here it's kind of implying that it was not in fact secured.
[01:49:00.100 --> 01:49:00.100]   And here it's kind of implying that it was not in fact secured.
[01:49:00.100 --> 01:49:00.100]   I think it was taking things from the press. Yeah, that is not correct.
[01:49:00.100 --> 01:49:00.140]   I think it was taking things from the press. Yeah, that is not correct.
[01:49:00.140 --> 01:49:00.180]   The reason I agreed to the fine for the SEC is not because the SEC was correct.
[01:49:00.180 --> 01:49:00.200]   The reason I agreed to the fine for the SEC is not because the SEC was correct.
[01:49:00.200 --> 01:49:00.240]   The reason I agreed to the fine for the SEC was not because the SEC was correct.
[01:49:00.240 --> 01:49:00.340]   That was extremely bad behavior by the SEC.
[01:49:00.340 --> 01:49:00.380]   That was extremely bad behavior by the SEC.
[01:49:00.380 --> 01:49:00.400]   And then it was extremely bad behavior by the SEC corruption, frankly.
[01:49:00.400 --> 01:49:00.420]   And the SEC was not correct.
[01:49:00.420 --> 01:49:00.820]   And that was extremely bad behavior by the SEC.
[01:49:00.840 --> 01:49:07.940]   But if I did not agree to pay the fine, Tesla would have gone bankrupt immediately.
[01:49:07.940 --> 01:49:07.980]   But if I did not agree to pay the fine, Tesla would have gone bankrupt immediately.
[01:49:07.980 --> 01:49:07.980]   So I was told by our CFO that the banks would immediately suspend our lines of credit.
[01:49:07.980 --> 01:49:14.480]   So I was told by our CFO that the banks would immediately suspend our lines of credit.
[01:49:14.480 --> 01:49:14.500]   And if they suspend our lines of credit at that time, we would have gone bankrupt instantly.
[01:49:14.500 --> 01:49:18.480]   And if they suspend our lines of credit at that time, we would have gone bankrupt instantly.
[01:49:18.480 --> 01:49:20.260]   So there would never have been an opportunity for a trial because Tesla would be dead.
[01:49:20.260 --> 01:49:22.420]   So there would never have been an opportunity for a trial because Tesla would be dead.
[01:49:22.420 --> 01:49:24.380]   So really, this is like someone holding a gun to your kid's head and saying pay $20 million.
[01:49:24.380 --> 01:49:30.360]   So really, this is like someone holding a gun to your kid's head and saying pay $20 million.
[01:49:30.400 --> 01:50:00.340]  , and admitting it.
[01:50:00.340 --> 01:50:00.360]   There's like hostage negotiation.
[01:50:00.360 --> 01:50:00.360]   Was that story fully told?
[01:50:00.360 --> 01:50:00.380]   I mean, SEC in its best form could be a force for good.
[01:50:00.380 --> 01:50:00.380]   It should be.
[01:50:00.380 --> 01:50:00.380]   But not once did the SEC go after any of the hedge funds who were nonstop shorting and distorting Tesla.
[01:50:00.380 --> 01:50:00.380]   Not once. The hedge funds would lie flat out on TV for their own gain at the expense of retail investors.
[01:50:00.380 --> 01:50:00.380]   And not once did the SEC go after any of the hedge funds who were nonstop shorting and distorting Tesla.
[01:50:00.380 --> 01:50:00.380]   and not once did the hedge funds would lie flat out on TV for their own gain at the expense of retail investors.
[01:50:00.380 --> 01:50:00.380]  , and not once did the hedge funds would lie flat out on TV for their own gain at the expense of retail investors.
[01:50:00.400 --> 01:50:02.420]   literally a thousand times.
[01:50:02.420 --> 01:50:03.420]   not once did the SEC pursue them.
[01:50:03.420 --> 01:50:04.420]   How do you explain this failure in the SEC?
[01:50:04.420 --> 01:50:05.420]   The incentive structure is messed up.
[01:50:05.420 --> 01:50:06.420]   Because the lawyers at the SEC are not paid well.
[01:50:06.420 --> 01:50:07.420]   It's a fairly low-paying job.
[01:50:07.420 --> 01:50:08.420]   But what they're looking for is a trophy.
[01:50:08.420 --> 01:50:09.420]   From the SEC, they're looking for something they put on, basically, their LinkedIn.
[01:50:09.420 --> 01:50:10.420]   From that, they can get a job at a high-paying law firm.
[01:50:10.420 --> 01:50:11.420]   And they're looking for something that they can put on, basically, their LinkedIn.
[01:50:11.420 --> 01:50:12.420]   From that, they can get a job at a high-paying law firm.
[01:50:12.420 --> 01:50:13.420]   And they're looking for something that they can put on, basically, their LinkedIn.
[01:50:13.420 --> 01:50:14.420]   And they're looking for something that they can put on, basically, their LinkedIn.
[01:50:14.420 --> 01:50:15.420]   And they're looking for something that they can put on, basically, their LinkedIn.
[01:50:15.440 --> 01:50:33.460]   That's exactly what the lawyer here did.
[01:50:33.460 --> 01:50:37.460]   And the reason they don't attack the hedge funds is because those hedge funds employ
[01:50:37.460 --> 01:50:38.460]   those law firms.
[01:50:38.460 --> 01:50:39.460]   And they know if they attack the hedge funds, they're going to be in trouble.
[01:50:39.460 --> 01:50:40.460]   And they're looking for something that they can put on, basically, their LinkedIn.
[01:50:40.460 --> 01:50:41.460]   And they're looking for something that they can put on, basically, their LinkedIn.

[01:51:25.600 --> 01:51:45.000]   .. anyhow. And,
[01:51:45.560 --> 01:52:00.960]   ìž¬ë "There was a time where Elon called the British cave diver a "pedo guy". After the diver criticized Musk's plan to rescue a group of boys trapped in a Thai cave, that little outburst earned him another lawsuit, and he had to apologize and pay the assettlement.
[01:52:00.960 --> 01:52:15.540]   That's false. There was no assettlement. There was a court case, which the guy who was not a cave diver, and was not part of the rescue team, filed a lawsuit against me.
[01:52:15.540 --> 01:52:15.540]   The court case was not a cave diver, and I played it was not part of the rescue team, file a lawsuit against me, and the lawyer filed a lawsuit against me, and the lawyer filed a lawsuit against me.
[01:52:15.560 --> 01:52:45.560]   lost, and he received nothing. So in this case it is wrong. It is also, I guess, taken this from the conventional media.
[01:52:45.560 --> 01:52:45.560]   The SEC civil case, where the civil complaints on the SEC guys lost unanimous jury verdict in San Francisco. They picked San Francisco because they thought it was the place I was most likely to lose, and a unanimous verdict in my favor.
[01:52:45.560 --> 01:52:45.560]   They picked San Francisco because they thought it was the place I was most likely to lose, and a unanimous verdict in my favor.

[01:53:15.580 --> 01:53:15.580]   There's an interesting question here. There seems to be a lot more clicks if a journalistic organization writes a negative article about you, Elon Musk. That's like one of the best ways to get clicks.
