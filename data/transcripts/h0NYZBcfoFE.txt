[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Good Monday morning, and thank you for listening.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.360]   Today we begin the week with a really sharp and robust question from a listener named
[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.360]   Arnaldo.
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:14.360]   Here it is.
[00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.000]   "Hello Tony and Pastor John.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.680]   Thank you for your labors in this podcast.
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.920]   My question is one that I've struggled with for over two decades now.
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.540]   It's this.
[00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.380]   How can I live with a good conscience?
[00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.340]   The Apostle Paul often talks about the conscience and how specifically a good conscience is
[00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.940]   something he always lived with, apparently even before he became a Christian."
[00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.700]   Acts 23 1 and Acts 24 16.
[00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:48.720]   We also see that a good conscience is a qualification for Christian leaders in 1 Timothy 3 9.
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:54.040]   And having a good conscience is an important goal of the Christian life for all believers,
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.800]   according to 1 Timothy 1 5 19.
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.420]   When I read the way Paul uses the word conscience in these contexts, it seems like he's saying
[00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:10.160]   it means to be presently walking in obedience to everything God has revealed to him.
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.660]   He does not seem to mean that he's trusting in Christ's blood to cover over his indwelling
[00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:15.660]   sin.
[00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:22.140]   I believe in both the doctrine of indwelling sin and of progressive sanctification, according
[00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.980]   to texts like Proverbs 4 18 and Romans 7 verses 21 to 23.
[00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:34.300]   God is always revealing to me new areas and sometimes old areas where I need to grow in
[00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.860]   holiness.
[00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.540]   These are very real sin issues that I can't simply stop doing, like turning off a light
[00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:41.800]   switch.
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:48.540]   These are ones in which I am engaged in a long-term, ongoing struggle and fight.
[00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:56.380]   So I pray for daily forgiveness, according to 1 John 1 verses 8 to 10 and Matthew 6 12.
[00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.060]   All this means that I literally never have a good conscience.
[00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.780]   I am always aware of important ways in which I presently need to repent and become more
[00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.080]   holy.
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:14.060]   So if a good conscience is a basic Christian issue, and Paul always had one, yet I will
[00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:20.900]   always know of sin areas in my life, and if I have to pray daily for forgiveness, how
[00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:27.780]   could I, or any Christian for that matter, ever attain to a good conscience?
[00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:34.420]   Well, Arnaldo has done his homework.
[00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:54.580]   He laid out texts in that question, as I hear it, that contain all the pieces.
[00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:01.340]   If there's a solution, and I do believe there is, it's probably found inside those texts
[00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:08.260]   that he was just commenting on, but maybe drawing some inferences from them that were
[00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.180]   not necessarily accurate.
[00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.980]   I feel the force of the question.
[00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:21.300]   Experientially, walking in a good conscience is not easy for me, since I share Arnaldo's
[00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:32.940]   deep awareness of my ongoing indwelling sin—that's Paul's term in Romans 7 17, 7 20, 7 23, that's
[00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.100]   his term.
[00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:41.540]   We all have remaining corruption and indwelling sin, and so the more keenly you are aware
[00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:48.340]   of that, the more you will feel embattled at the level of needing a good conscience.
[00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:49.340]   So I get it.
[00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.420]   I mean, I think that's a serious question.
[00:03:53.420 --> 00:04:02.500]   The whole New Testament does assume that in this life nobody attains sinless perfection.
[00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:03.860]   We need to just settle that.
[00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.020]   That's one of the premises.
[00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.860]   Nobody attains sinless perfection in this life.
[00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.660]   Jesus said that we would pray, "Forgive us our sins right after, give us this day
[00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:15.820]   our daily bread."
[00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.180]   They go together every day.
[00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.620]   Say both of those.
[00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:26.260]   Paul said that I have not already attained perfection, but I press on to make it my own.
[00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:32.340]   He referred to the sin that dwells in him and cried out in dismay, "Who will deliver
[00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.980]   me from this body of death?"
[00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.700]   Romans 7 24.
[00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:43.460]   Jesus pointed to the publican who said, "God, be merciful to me, a sinner," over against
[00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:49.780]   the Pharisee who was thanking God that he had such a clear conscience, and said that
[00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:55.580]   the one who cried out for mercy about his sin went down to his house justified.
[00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:00.580]   So it was good for him to own his sinfulness, not say, "Oh, it doesn't exist.
[00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:01.580]   I've got a clear conscience.
[00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.800]   I don't have any sin to repent of."
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.660]   So we feel the force.
[00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:16.220]   Now I think 1 John 1 is not only especially illuminating, but gives us a category alongside
[00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:21.260]   good conscience that may provide the solution.
[00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:26.220]   So here's my reading of 1 John 1 6-10.
[00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:33.900]   If we say we have fellowship with God while we walk in darkness, we lie.
[00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.780]   We do not practice the truth.
[00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:45.820]   But if we walk in the light as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another,
[00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:50.740]   and the blood of Jesus, his Son, cleanses us from all sin.
[00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.600]   Now that is staggeringly amazing.
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.580]   If we walk in the light, the blood of Jesus cleanses us.
[00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:58.580]   Wow.
[00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.020]   Here's verse 8.
[00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:08.140]   If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
[00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:12.380]   So now he's reeling it back in and saying, "Oh, whoa, whoa.
[00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:16.020]   Don't assume that when I say walk in the light, I mean sinlessness."
[00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.100]   Huh.
[00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.740]   Verse 9.
[00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:24.660]   If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse
[00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.040]   us from all unrighteousness.
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:32.460]   If we say we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and the word is not in us.
[00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:38.860]   Now what's amazing about this passage—there are a bunch of amazing things about this passage—but
[00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:45.060]   what's amazing about this passage is that it says we must be walking in the light for
[00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:48.860]   the blood of Jesus to cleanse us from our sins.
[00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:53.780]   But then he says that this walking in the light doesn't mean sinlessness.
[00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:57.980]   We are liars if we say it does.
[00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:06.220]   Then he explains, "When we walk in the light, we see clearly enough"—we have light—"see
[00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:09.460]   clearly enough to know sin."
[00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:17.260]   See sin as what it is and hate it and confess it, and then we enjoy ongoing cleansing and
[00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.360]   forgiveness.
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:26.760]   So here's what I would draw from this if I use the category of conscience to explain
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.360]   this passage.
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:35.840]   A good conscience is virtually the same as walking in the light.
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:43.920]   Christians should be able to say, "I'm walking in the light," and mean it, and mean by that,
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:52.800]   "I'm walking in a good conscience," which means I don't think we should equate having
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:56.520]   a bad conscience with having indwelling sin.
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:00.280]   That may be the most important thing I say, Tony, so let me say it again.
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:11.000]   So I'm inferring from what I've said from 1 John 1 that having a bad conscience is not
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.480]   the same as having indwelling sin.
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:17.400]   They're not the same.
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:20.080]   That's my basic answer to Arnaldo's question.
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:28.120]   He feels that as long as he is aware of the reality of indwelling sin, as in Romans 7,
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.760]   he cannot have a good conscience.
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:36.480]   Now, if that were true, I don't think Paul could ever have a good conscience, but he
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:39.400]   clearly says he does have a good conscience.
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:46.200]   In 1 Timothy 1.3, "I thank God whom I serve, as did my ancestors, with a clear conscience."
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:49.240]   And he expects the elders of the church to do the same.
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:55.520]   1 Timothy 3.9, "They must hold the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience."
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:58.840]   And that's the goal for all Christians, according to 1 Timothy 1.5.
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:04.440]   "The aim of our charge is love that issues from a pure heart and a good conscience and
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.440]   sincere faith."
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:14.840]   So I don't think we should equate good conscience with sinless perfection in this life, nor
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:23.120]   equate bad conscience with the presence of indwelling sin or remaining corruption.
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:30.520]   Rather, a clear or a good conscience is like walking in the light.
[00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:37.400]   In 1 John 1, "If we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:42.120]   one another, and the blood of Jesus cleanses us from all sin."
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:49.160]   If we say we have no sin—in other words, if we interpret walking in the light as sinless
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:54.060]   perfection—we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
[00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:59.200]   If we confess our sins, he's faithful and just to forgive our sins and cleanse us from
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:01.280]   all unrighteousness.
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:10.640]   I think both Paul and John inherited this conception of ongoing, indwelling sin that
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:18.120]   nevertheless coexists with a good conscience from the Psalms in the Old Testament.
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:25.920]   For example, in Psalm 25, David confesses three times that he's a sinner.
[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:29.700]   Verse 8, "God instructs sinners in the way."
[00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:33.180]   Verse 11, "Pardon my guilt, for it is great."
[00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:37.300]   Verse 18, "Forgive all my sins."
[00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:44.920]   But the Psalm comes to an end in verse 21 like this, "May integrity and uprightness
[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:48.800]   preserve me, for I wait for you."
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:54.760]   So in David's mind—and he's writing under God's inspiration, and this is not the only
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:11:00.840]   place in the Psalms—there's a lot of Psalms that distinguish the righteous and the wicked.
[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:02.480]   And the righteous are really righteous.
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:03.480]   They're walking in the light.
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:06.200]   They have a good conscience.
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:14.240]   In David's mind, there is an integrity and an uprightness that is aware of indwelling
[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:23.200]   corruption that breaks out at times in sins—it does—and that ongoing reality of indwelling
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:31.200]   sin does not nullify what David calls his integrity and his uprightness.
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:34.280]   I think Paul and John saw that.
[00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:40.240]   They were immersed in the Old Testament and used language that way.
[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:45.080]   John used the language of walking in the light, though we are imperfect.
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:53.120]   Paul used the language of walking in a good conscience, though we are imperfect.
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:12:00.120]   And I think for all of them—David, Paul, John—the key that enabled them to think
[00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:10.920]   this way is that they all knew God had made a way for all their sins to be passed over—namely,
[00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:14.320]   the blood of the Lamb, Jesus Christ.
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:18.840]   David knew this was coming, and Paul and John knew it had come.
[00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:28.800]   I do think Arnaldo is right to say that justification by faith is not the same as walking in a good
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:32.880]   conscience or walking in the light or having integrity.
[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:37.720]   Those are real character traits, not imputed righteousness.
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:46.480]   Nevertheless, it's the covering of all their sins by the blood of Jesus that enables them
[00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:55.280]   to look upon their conscience and walking and integrity with thankfulness and confidence
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:13:03.240]   that it really will be accepted by God as good, though imperfect.
[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:04.840]   Here's one last implication.
[00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:08.840]   People might think, "Well, what does this really—how does this matter?"
[00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:13.800]   Here's a concrete illustration of how it matters.
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:21.040]   Suppose a pastor is accused falsely of being unfaithful to his wife, and the reason he's
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:29.000]   accused is because someone in the congregation hates him and wants him to be dismissed.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:35.480]   And when he comes before the church or the elders to state the truth with his children
[00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:46.520]   present and his wife looking on, that is not the time for him to say to the church, "Well,
[00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:50.480]   yes, I am a sinner like everybody else.
[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:55.600]   I'm no better than adulterers.
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:14:01.480]   Everyone has indwelling sin that crops out from time to time, and I shouldn't be put
[00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:02.480]   on a pedestal.
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.600]   I'm no better than anyone else."
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:05.600]   No!
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:07.600]   No, no, no.
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:12.040]   That is not the time to say that with your kids listening and your wife listening and
[00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:14.080]   the whole church wondering.
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:19.360]   What you need to say at that moment is this, "My conscience is clear.
[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:22.160]   I am a man of integrity.
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:24.480]   I have walked in the light.
[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:32.320]   I have never touched that woman or any woman sexually besides my wife, and this accusation
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:35.320]   is not true."
[00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:42.360]   So I think that is one of the implications of what Paul is saying when he says to the
[00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:49.000]   elders and to the rest of us that we should walk in a good conscience, or as John would
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.400]   say, walk in the light.
[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:52.400]   Bingo.
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:56.240]   That is a great point, especially in 1 John 1, verses 7 to 10.
[00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:00.920]   "Walking in the light is not a life of sinless perfection."
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:01.920]   That's a profound connection.
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:02.920]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:04.480]   And thank you for joining us today.
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:08.600]   Ask a question of your own, like Arnaldo did today, or search our archive or subscribe
[00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:11.360]   to the podcast hall at AskPastorJohn.com.
[00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:20.500]   Well, I love to find sermon clips where Pastor John pastors his congregation by illustrating
[00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:24.360]   how he does certain things in the Christian life.
[00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:28.400]   From the pulpit, he will sometimes break into an example of, say, what it looks like for
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:33.400]   him when he meditates on the Word or focuses his heart on Christ.
[00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:36.080]   And I just found another example of him doing this very thing.
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:37.960]   I'll share it with you next time.
[00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:41.960]   I'm your host Tony Reinke, and we'll see you back here on Wednesday.
[00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:42.460]   See you then.
[00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:47.460]   [END]
