[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.320]   Welcome to Huberman Lab Essentials,
[00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.080]   where we revisit past episodes
[00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.260]   for the most potent and actionable science-based tools
[00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.040]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.040]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Anna Lemke.
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.640]   I and many listeners of this podcast
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.540]   are obsessed with dopamine.
[00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.080]   What is dopamine?
[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.180]   And what are maybe some things about dopamine
[00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.860]   that most people don't know?
[00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.900]   And probably that I don't know either.
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.020]   So dopamine is a neurotransmitter,
[00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.120]   and neurotransmitters are those molecules
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.100]   that bridge the gap between two neurons.
[00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.840]   So they essentially allow one neuron,
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.120]   the presynaptic neuron,
[00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.640]   to communicate with the postsynaptic neuron.
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.980]   Dopamine is intimately associated
[00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.980]   with the experience of reward,
[00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.700]   but also with movement,
[00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.100]   which I think is really interesting
[00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.440]   because movement and reward are linked, right?
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.180]   If you think about, you know, early humans,
[00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.460]   you had to move in order to go seek out the water
[00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.960]   or the meat or whatever it was.
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.820]   So dopamine is this really powerful,
[00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.820]   important molecule in the brain
[00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.640]   that helps us experience pleasure.
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.420]   It's not the only neurotransmitter involved in pleasure,
[00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.040]   but it's a really, really important one.
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.700]   And if you want to think about something
[00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.520]   that most people don't know about dopamine,
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.000]   which I think is really interesting,
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.020]   is that we are always releasing dopamine
[00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.860]   at a kind of tonic baseline rate.
[00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.260]   And it's really the deviation from that baseline
[00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.260]   rather than like hits of dopamine in a vacuum
[00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:42.120]   that make a difference.
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.100]   So when we experience pleasure,
[00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.140]   our dopamine release goes above baseline.
[00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.080]   And likewise, dopamine can go below that tonic baseline.
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.800]   And then we experience a kind of pain.
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:54.680]   Interesting.
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.140]   So is it fair to say that one's baseline levels of dopamine,
[00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.620]   how frequently we are releasing dopamine
[00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.920]   in the absence of some, I don't know,
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.800]   drug or food or experience,
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.700]   just sitting, being,
[00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.620]   is that associated with how happy somebody is,
[00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:13.900]   their kind of baseline of happiness
[00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.200]   or level of depression?
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.900]   There is evidence that shows
[00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.500]   that people who are depressed
[00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.260]   may indeed have lower tonic levels of dopamine.
[00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.140]   So that's a really reasonable thought.
[00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.180]   And there is some evidence to suggest
[00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.440]   that that may be true.
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.120]   The other thing that we know
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.260]   is that if we expose ourselves chronically
[00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.100]   to substances or behaviors
[00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.180]   that repeatedly release large amounts of dopamine
[00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.980]   in our brain's reward pathway,
[00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.120]   that we can change our tonic baseline
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.120]   and actually lower it over time
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.240]   as our brain tries to compensate
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.180]   for all of that dopamine,
[00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.740]   which is more really than we were designed to experience.
[00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:00.640]   Interesting.
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.040]   And is it the case
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.860]   that our baseline levels of dopamine
[00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.520]   are set by our genetics,
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.400]   by our heredity?
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.400]   Well, I think, you know,
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.280]   if you think about sort of, you know,
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.300]   the early stages of development in infancy,
[00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.920]   certainly that is true.
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.300]   You're kind of, you know,
[00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.300]   born with probably whatever is your baseline level,
[00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.120]   but obviously your experiences
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.240]   can have a huge impact
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:28.580]   on where your dopamine level ultimately settles out.
[00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.160]   Do you think that's a set in terms of our parents
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.480]   and obviously nature and nurture interact,
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.440]   but is dopamine at the core of our temperament?
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.740]   I don't really think we know the answer to that,
[00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.260]   but I will say that
[00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.740]   people are definitely born with different temperaments,
[00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.880]   and those temperaments do affect
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.620]   their ability to experience joy.
[00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.720]   And, you know, we've known that for a long time
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.940]   and we describe that in many different ways.
[00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.500]   One of the ways that we describe that in the modern era
[00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.920]   is to use psychiatric nomenclature,
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.460]   like this person has a dysthymic temperament
[00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:09.300]   or, you know,
[00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.080]   this person has chronic major depressive disorder.
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.980]   In terms of looking specifically
[00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.100]   at who's vulnerable to addiction,
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.500]   that's an interesting sort of mixed bag
[00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.940]   because when you look at the research
[00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.920]   on risk factors for addictions
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.700]   or what kind of temperament of a person
[00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.360]   makes them more vulnerable to addiction,
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.980]   you see some interesting findings.
[00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.140]   First, you see that people who are more impulsive,
[00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.620]   who have a thought to do something
[00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.560]   and just do it impulsively,
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.400]   are people who are more vulnerable to addiction.
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.500]   What we now conceptualize in our current ecosystem
[00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.000]   as mental illness
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.760]   are actually traits that in another ecosystem
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.820]   might be very advantageous.
[00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.740]   They're just not advantageous right now
[00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.720]   because of the world that we live in.
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.500]   And I think, you know,
[00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.360]   impulsivity is potentially one of those, right?
[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.940]   Because we live in this world
[00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.560]   that's such a sensory rich environment, right?
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.860]   That we're being bombarded
[00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.380]   with all of these opportunities,
[00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:12.540]   these sensory opportunities,
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.980]   and we have to constantly check ourselves.
[00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.460]   And so impulsivity is something that right now
[00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.960]   can be a difficult trait,
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.940]   but isn't in and of itself a bad thing.
[00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.720]   In a previous conversation we had,
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.340]   you said something that really rung in my mind,
[00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.980]   which is that many people who become addicted to things
[00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.740]   have this feeling that normal life
[00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.440]   isn't interesting enough.
[00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:39.080]   Maybe you could just tell us a little bit about your experience
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.880]   with this association,
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:41.960]   if it really exists,
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.920]   between people's sense of the normalcy
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.340]   or maybe even how boring life can be
[00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.120]   and their tendency to become addicts of some sort.
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:55.620]   I think that life for humans has always been hard,
[00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:01.280]   but I think that now it's harder in unprecedented ways.
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:05.520]   And I think that the way that life is really hard now
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.620]   is that it actually is really boring.
[00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.140]   All of our survival needs are met.
[00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.060]   We don't even have to leave our homes
[00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.440]   to meet every single physical need.
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.980]   You know, as long as you're of a certain level
[00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:18.960]   of financial well-being,
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.060]   which frankly, you know,
[00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:24.120]   we talk so much about, you know, the income gap,
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.940]   and certainly there is this enormous gap
[00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:26.780]   between rich and poor,
[00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.540]   but that gap is smaller than it's ever been
[00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:31.460]   in like the history of humans.
[00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.740]   We don't really have anything that we have to do.
[00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:38.300]   So we're all forced to make stuff up,
[00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.920]   you know, whether it's being a scientist
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:45.980]   or being a doctor or being an Olympic athlete
[00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:49.140]   or, you know, climbing Mount Everest.
[00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:54.140]   And people really vary in their need for friction.
[00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:56.840]   And some people need a lot more than others.
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.220]   And if they don't have it,
[00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:00.000]   they're really, really unhappy.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.360]   And I do think that a lot of the people
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.000]   that I see with addiction
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.600]   and other forms of mental illness
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.900]   are people who need more friction.
[00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.040]   Like they're unhappy,
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.600]   not necessarily because there's something wrong
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.280]   with their brain,
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:17.520]   but because their brain is not suited to this world.
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.540]   Let's talk about the pleasure-pain balance
[00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:21.520]   and addiction.
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.920]   And I've heard you use this seesaw
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:27.180]   or balance scale analogy before.
[00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:28.560]   And I think it's a wonderful one.
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:29.580]   Yeah.
[00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:31.780]   So to me, one of the most significant findings
[00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:33.980]   in neuroscience in the last 75 years
[00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:36.740]   is that pleasure and pain are co-located,
[00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:38.740]   which means the same parts of the brain
[00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:41.560]   that process pleasure also process pain.
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.360]   And they work like a balance.
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.820]   So when we feel pleasure,
[00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:46.320]   our balance tips one way.
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:47.140]   When we feel pain,
[00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:49.040]   it tips in the opposite direction.
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:51.560]   And one of the overriding rules
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:52.580]   governing this balance
[00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:54.140]   is that it wants to stay level.
[00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.020]   So it doesn't want to remain tipped very long
[00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:57.380]   to pleasure or to pain.
[00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:00.040]   And with any deviation from neutrality,
[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:01.560]   the brain will work very hard
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.140]   to restore a level balance
[00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:05.780]   or what scientists call homeostasis.
[00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:07.920]   And the way the brain does that
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.560]   is with any stimulus to one side,
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:12.140]   there will be a tip
[00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:13.940]   in equal and opposite amount
[00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:15.260]   to the other side.
[00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:15.860]   It's like they have
[00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:17.280]   principal laws of physics.
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.680]   Yes, right, right.
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.840]   So like I like to watch YouTube videos.
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.160]   When I watch YouTube videos
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.120]   of American Idol,
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:23.920]   you know,
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.240]   it tips to the side of pleasure.
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:27.920]   And then when I stop watching it,
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:29.940]   I have a come down, right,
[00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:31.700]   which is a tip to the equal
[00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:32.540]   and opposite amount
[00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:34.260]   on the other side.
[00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:35.160]   And that's that moment
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:36.080]   of wanting to watch
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.580]   one more YouTube video, right?
[00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:38.340]   It's not something
[00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:39.840]   that consciously happens
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.340]   or that we're aware of
[00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:43.040]   unless we really begin
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:44.100]   to pay attention.
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:45.240]   And of course,
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.700]   one way to combat that
[00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:48.500]   is to do it more, right?
[00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:49.720]   And more and more and more.
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.800]   So I think that is really
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:52.800]   what I want people
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:53.660]   to tune into
[00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:55.620]   and get an awareness around
[00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:57.000]   because once you tune into it,
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.080]   you can see it a lot.
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.320]   And if you, you know,
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:08:59.980]   keep the model
[00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:00.960]   of the balance in mind,
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:02.840]   I think it gives people
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:04.560]   kind of a way
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:05.680]   to imagine
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.800]   what they're experiencing
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.540]   on a neurobiological level
[00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:10.780]   and understand it.
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:12.460]   and in that understanding,
[00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:14.040]   get some mastery over it,
[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:14.580]   which is really
[00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:15.700]   what this is all about.
[00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:16.860]   Because ultimately,
[00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:19.380]   we do need to disengage, right?
[00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:22.080]   We can't live in that space
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.480]   all the time, right?
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:24.420]   We have other things
[00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:25.240]   we need to do.
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:26.320]   And there are also
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.660]   serious consequences
[00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:28.740]   that come with
[00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:30.060]   trying to repeat
[00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:32.520]   and continue that experience
[00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:33.240]   or that feeling.
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.720]   Yeah, so if I understand
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:35.360]   this correctly,
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:37.240]   when we find something
[00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:39.200]   that we enjoy
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.480]   that feels pleasurable,
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:41.940]   social media,
[00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:43.400]   food, sex,
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:44.660]   gambling,
[00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:45.800]   whatever happens to be,
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.500]   there's some dopamine release
[00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:48.160]   when we engage
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:48.860]   in that behavior.
[00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:51.180]   And then what you're telling me
[00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:52.420]   is that very quickly
[00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:53.920]   and beneath
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:54.980]   my conscious awareness,
[00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:57.560]   there's a tilting back
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:58.260]   of the scale
[00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.280]   where pleasure is reduced
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:02.340]   by way of increasing pain.
[00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:02.780]   Right.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.260]   And I've heard you say before
[00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.520]   that the pain mechanism
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:10.800]   has some competitive advantages
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.900]   over the pleasure mechanism
[00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:14.320]   such that it doesn't just
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.640]   bring the scale back to level.
[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:17.380]   It actually brings pain
[00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:19.000]   higher than pleasure.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.120]   What happens right after
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:21.720]   I do something
[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:22.920]   that is really pleasurable
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:23.900]   and releases a lot of dopamine
[00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:24.660]   is, again,
[00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:25.860]   my brain is going to
[00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:27.000]   immediately compensate
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.620]   by down-regulating
[00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:29.660]   my own dopamine receptors,
[00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:30.840]   my own dopamine transmission
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:32.600]   to compensate for that.
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:32.960]   Okay.
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:35.640]   And that's that come down
[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:36.500]   or the hangover
[00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:37.420]   or that after effect,
[00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:38.180]   that moment of wanting
[00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:38.760]   to do it more.
[00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:40.620]   Now, if I just wait
[00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:42.420]   for that feeling to pass,
[00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:43.700]   then my dopamine
[00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:44.760]   will re-regulate itself
[00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:45.240]   and I'll go back
[00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:46.760]   to whatever my chronic baseline is.
[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:47.960]   But if I don't wait,
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:48.920]   and here's really the key,
[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:49.840]   if I keep indulging
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:51.400]   again and again and again,
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:52.380]   ultimately,
[00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:54.860]   I have so much
[00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:56.480]   on the pain side,
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:56.960]   right,
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:57.700]   that I've essentially
[00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:59.220]   reset my brain
[00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:00.460]   to what we call
[00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:01.760]   like an anhedonic
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.200]   or lacking in joy
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:04.500]   type of state,
[00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:05.800]   which is a dopamine
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:07.040]   deficit state.
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:07.760]   So that's really
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:09.460]   the way in which
[00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:11.040]   pain can become
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:11.780]   the main driver
[00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:13.420]   is because I've indulged
[00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:14.380]   so much in these
[00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:15.500]   high-reward behaviors
[00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:16.580]   or substances
[00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:17.900]   that my brain
[00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:18.960]   has had to compensate
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.800]   by way down-regulating
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:21.620]   my own dopamine
[00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:22.440]   such that
[00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:23.580]   even when I'm not
[00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:24.760]   doing that drug,
[00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:26.040]   I'm in a dopamine
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:26.700]   deficit state
[00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:27.220]   which is akin
[00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:28.340]   to a clinical depression.
[00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:29.520]   I have anxiety,
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:30.180]   irritability,
[00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:31.160]   insomnia, dysphoria,
[00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:32.320]   and a lot of mental
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:33.080]   preoccupation
[00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:34.100]   with using again
[00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:35.040]   or getting the drug.
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:36.240]   So in general,
[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:37.000]   what we want
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.340]   is some kind
[00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:39.540]   of flexibility
[00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:40.940]   in that balance
[00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:41.620]   and the ability
[00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:42.700]   to easily
[00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:44.080]   reassert homeostasis.
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:44.600]   We don't want
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:45.720]   to break our balance,
[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:46.900]   which is possible
[00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:48.260]   if we overindulge
[00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:49.140]   for enough period
[00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:49.540]   of time
[00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:50.460]   and end up
[00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:51.000]   with a balance
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:51.900]   tipped to the side
[00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:52.300]   of pain,
[00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:52.860]   this dopamine
[00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:53.580]   deficit state
[00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:54.440]   we've been talking about.
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:56.380]   We want a flexible,
[00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:57.960]   resilient balance,
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:58.280]   right,
[00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:59.540]   which can be sensitive
[00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:00.580]   to things going on
[00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:01.200]   in the environment,
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.280]   which can experience
[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:04.040]   pleasure and approach,
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:05.300]   which can experience
[00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:06.720]   pain and recoil,
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:07.260]   right,
[00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:08.280]   this is all adaptive
[00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:08.940]   and healthy
[00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:09.680]   and necessary
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:10.460]   and good.
[00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:11.560]   We would never want
[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:12.000]   a balance
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.180]   that doesn't tilt.
[00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:13.600]   Right.
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:14.640]   That would be a disaster.
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:14.900]   Right.
[00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:15.800]   We wouldn't be human.
[00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:17.220]   And we wouldn't want that.
[00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:17.700]   It would be really,
[00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:18.380]   really boring.
[00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:19.700]   On the other hand,
[00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:20.780]   what people in recovery
[00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:21.520]   from addiction
[00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:22.820]   talk about is
[00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:24.080]   to some extent
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.140]   having to learn
[00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:26.120]   to live with
[00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.440]   things being a little boring
[00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:29.760]   a lot of the time,
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:30.120]   right?
[00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:31.920]   So trying to avoid
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:33.180]   some of this intensity
[00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:34.700]   and thrill-seeking
[00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:36.140]   and escapism
[00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:36.780]   that really is
[00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:37.440]   at the core
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:38.680]   of addictive tendencies.
[00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:40.840]   So along those lines,
[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:42.020]   I've heard you say
[00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:43.460]   that in order to reset
[00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:44.600]   the dopamine system,
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.560]   essentially in order
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:47.600]   to break an addictive
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:48.560]   pattern,
[00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:49.880]   30 days
[00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:52.360]   of zero interaction
[00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:53.620]   with that substance,
[00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:54.460]   that person,
[00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:55.220]   et cetera.
[00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:55.640]   Right.
[00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:56.280]   Is that correct?
[00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:57.040]   Yeah.
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:58.240]   And 30 days
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:59.780]   is in my clinical experience
[00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:00.640]   the average amount
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:01.680]   of time it takes
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:02.140]   for the brain
[00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:02.740]   to reset,
[00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:03.680]   reward pathways,
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:04.940]   for dopamine transmission
[00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:06.340]   to regenerate itself.
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:08.100]   by depriving ourselves
[00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:09.700]   of this high dopamine,
[00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:11.440]   high reward substance
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.180]   or behavior,
[00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:13.560]   we allow our brains
[00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:14.320]   to regenerate
[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:14.980]   its own dopamine
[00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:15.840]   for the balance
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:16.620]   to really equilibrate
[00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:18.080]   and then we're in a place
[00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:19.080]   where we can sort of
[00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:20.540]   enjoy other things.
[00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:21.740]   So I'd like to
[00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:22.760]   dissect out
[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:23.520]   that 30 days
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:24.080]   a little more
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:24.640]   finally.
[00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:26.700]   So days 1 through 10
[00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:27.860]   I would imagine
[00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:29.300]   will be very uncomfortable.
[00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:29.800]   Yes.
[00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:30.720]   Anxiety,
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:31.840]   trouble sleeping,
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:34.140]   physical agitation
[00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:34.800]   and to the point
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:35.120]   where,
[00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:36.420]   you know,
[00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:37.620]   maybe impulsive,
[00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:38.300]   angry.
[00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:40.100]   Should one expect
[00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:40.740]   all of that?
[00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:41.180]   Should the...
[00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:41.460]   Yeah.
[00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:42.520]   So what I say
[00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:43.080]   to patients
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:44.500]   and it's a really important
[00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:46.020]   piece of this intervention
[00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:47.700]   is that you will feel worse
[00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:49.020]   before you feel better.
[00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:49.940]   For how long?
[00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:50.260]   Yeah.
[00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:50.740]   This is probably
[00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:51.440]   the first question
[00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:52.140]   they ask, right?
[00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:53.520]   And I say usually
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:55.060]   in my clinical experience
[00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:56.520]   you'll feel worse
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:57.320]   for two weeks
[00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:58.500]   but if you can make it
[00:13:58.500 --> 00:13:59.800]   through those first two weeks
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:01.220]   the sun will start
[00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:01.920]   to come out
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:02.740]   in week three
[00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:03.840]   and by week four
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:05.400]   most people are feeling
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:06.600]   a whole lot better
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:07.260]   than they were
[00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:08.280]   before they stopped
[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:09.160]   using their substance.
[00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:10.440]   So it's a hard thing
[00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:11.540]   like you have to sign up
[00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:12.020]   for it.
[00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:14.600]   Then days 21 through 30
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:16.020]   dopamine is starting
[00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:16.640]   to be released
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:17.600]   in response to
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:18.860]   the taste of a really
[00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:19.880]   good cup of coffee
[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:20.480]   for instance.
[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:21.160]   Yes, exactly.
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:22.220]   whereas before
[00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:23.400]   it was only to
[00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:24.820]   insert
[00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:25.400]   you know
[00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:26.080]   addictive behavior.
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:26.360]   Right.
[00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:27.260]   One thing I've seen
[00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:28.360]   over and over again
[00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:29.080]   sadly
[00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:30.700]   often in the same individuals
[00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:31.200]   is
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:33.440]   they get sober
[00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:34.940]   from whatever
[00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:36.900]   they're doing great
[00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:38.080]   and then
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:38.860]   all of a sudden
[00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:40.020]   you get this call
[00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:41.180]   so and so's
[00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:43.080]   back in jail
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:44.080]   so and so's
[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:45.220]   wife is gonna leave him
[00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:45.980]   because he
[00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:47.460]   drank two bottles
[00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:48.440]   of wine
[00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:49.480]   and took a Xanax
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:50.360]   at 7am
[00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:51.840]   crashed his truck
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:52.460]   into a pole
[00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:53.600]   it's got two beautiful kids
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:54.340]   like how
[00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:56.160]   did this happen
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:56.640]   again
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:57.520]   to the point
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:58.420]   where by the fourth
[00:14:58.420 --> 00:14:59.180]   and fifth time
[00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:00.620]   people are just
[00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:01.780]   done
[00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:03.140]   and so what I'd like
[00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:03.740]   to talk about
[00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:04.460]   in this context
[00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:05.760]   is what sorts
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:06.320]   of things
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:07.060]   help
[00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:08.360]   other people
[00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:08.880]   that we know
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:09.520]   that are addicted
[00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:10.940]   what really helps
[00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:11.840]   and
[00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:12.880]   are there
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:13.640]   certain people
[00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:14.420]   for whom
[00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:15.940]   it's hopeless
[00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:16.580]   yeah
[00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:17.240]   so there
[00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:18.440]   there are people
[00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:19.720]   who will die
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:20.680]   of their disease
[00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:21.180]   of addiction
[00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:21.660]   you know
[00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:22.020]   and I think
[00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:23.040]   conceptualizing it
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:23.720]   as a disease
[00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:25.420]   is a helpful frame
[00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:26.760]   there are other frames
[00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:27.880]   that we could use
[00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:28.620]   but I do think
[00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:29.900]   given the
[00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:31.540]   brain physiologic
[00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:32.060]   changes
[00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:32.780]   that occur
[00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:34.480]   with sustained
[00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:36.100]   heavy drug use
[00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:37.480]   and what we know
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:38.600]   happens to the brain
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:40.420]   it is really
[00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:41.180]   reasonable
[00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:42.000]   to think of it
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   as a brain disease
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.220]   and for me
[00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:47.200]   the real window
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:48.320]   of let's say
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:49.740]   being able to access
[00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:50.660]   my compassion
[00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:52.080]   around people
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:53.080]   who are repeat
[00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:53.760]   relapsers
[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:54.660]   even when their life
[00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:55.500]   is so much better
[00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:56.600]   when they're in recovery
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:57.120]   yeah it's like
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:58.020]   it's like a no brainer
[00:15:58.020 --> 00:15:58.280]   right
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:00.840]   is to conceptualize
[00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:01.540]   this balance
[00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:02.200]   and the dopamine
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:02.980]   deficit state
[00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:03.580]   and a balance
[00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:04.780]   tilted to the side
[00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:05.260]   of pain
[00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:06.800]   and to imagine
[00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:08.100]   that for some
[00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:08.580]   people
[00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:10.240]   after a month
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:11.200]   or six months
[00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:11.900]   or maybe even
[00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:12.680]   six years
[00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:13.780]   their balance
[00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:14.800]   is still
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:15.880]   tipped to the side
[00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:16.280]   of pain
[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:17.220]   that on some level
[00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:18.200]   that balance
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:18.960]   has lost
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:20.080]   its resilience
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:21.040]   and its ability
[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:22.700]   to restore homeostasis
[00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:23.200]   it's almost like
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:23.980]   the hinge on that
[00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:25.060]   balance is messed up
[00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:25.440]   exactly
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:27.060]   imagine that
[00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:28.420]   you had an itch
[00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:29.620]   somewhere on your body
[00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:30.020]   okay
[00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:30.600]   I mean we've all
[00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:31.020]   had that
[00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:31.620]   like you know
[00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:32.920]   whatever the source
[00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:33.640]   you know
[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:34.700]   if you really focus
[00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:35.920]   you could go for
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:37.200]   a pretty good
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:37.860]   amount of time
[00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:38.600]   not scratching
[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:38.900]   it
[00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:40.340]   but the moment
[00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:41.020]   you stopped
[00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:42.040]   focusing on
[00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:42.860]   not scratching
[00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:43.160]   it
[00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:44.360]   you would scratch
[00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:44.500]   it
[00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:44.860]   and maybe
[00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:45.260]   you would do
[00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:45.720]   it while you
[00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:46.300]   were asleep
[00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:46.720]   right
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:48.780]   and that is
[00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:50.020]   what happens
[00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:50.640]   to people
[00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:51.740]   with severe
[00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:52.380]   addiction
[00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:53.640]   that balance
[00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:54.420]   is essentially
[00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:55.100]   broken
[00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:56.100]   homeostasis
[00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:56.720]   does not
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:57.320]   get restored
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:57.900]   despite
[00:16:57.900 --> 00:16:59.640]   sustained abstinence
[00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:00.540]   they're living
[00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:01.520]   with that
[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:02.380]   constant
[00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:03.220]   specter
[00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:04.120]   of that pull
[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:05.180]   it never
[00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:05.880]   goes away
[00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:06.540]   so let me say
[00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:07.040]   there are lots
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:07.320]   of people
[00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:07.700]   with addiction
[00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:08.040]   for whom
[00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:08.480]   that does
[00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:08.940]   go away
[00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:09.340]   and it goes
[00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:09.940]   away at four
[00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:10.260]   weeks
[00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:10.700]   for many
[00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:10.980]   of them
[00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:11.700]   but in
[00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:12.640]   severe cases
[00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:14.020]   that's always
[00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:14.720]   there
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:15.200]   and it's
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:15.660]   lingering
[00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:16.820]   and it's
[00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:17.320]   the moment
[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:17.740]   when they're
[00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:18.760]   not focusing
[00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:19.360]   on not
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:19.780]   using
[00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:20.520]   it's like
[00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:21.040]   a reflex
[00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:21.920]   they fall
[00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:22.680]   back into it
[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:23.240]   it's not
[00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:23.900]   purposeful
[00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:24.560]   it's not
[00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:25.060]   because they
[00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:25.520]   want to get
[00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:25.940]   high
[00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:26.600]   it's not
[00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:27.060]   because they
[00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:27.700]   value using
[00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:28.200]   drugs more
[00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:28.640]   than they do
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:29.360]   their family
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:30.360]   none of that
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:30.860]   it's that
[00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:31.580]   really
[00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:32.000]   they
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.100]   cannot
[00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:34.920]   not
[00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:35.500]   do it
[00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:36.060]   when given
[00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:37.320]   the opportunity
[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:38.440]   and that moment
[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:38.860]   when they're
[00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:39.300]   not thinking
[00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:39.840]   about it
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:40.320]   does that
[00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:40.680]   make sense
[00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:41.240]   that's a great
[00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:41.700]   description
[00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:42.280]   and actually
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:43.280]   in that description
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:44.560]   I can feel
[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:45.100]   a bit
[00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:45.680]   of empathy
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:46.460]   because
[00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:47.420]   the way
[00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:47.860]   you describe
[00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:48.460]   scratching an
[00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:48.860]   itch in your
[00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:49.300]   sleep
[00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:49.820]   yeah
[00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:50.380]   you know
[00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:51.120]   I've done
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:51.420]   that with
[00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:52.020]   mosquito bites
[00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:52.420]   in summer
[00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:53.000]   you're scratching
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.020]   you wake up
[00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:54.800]   scratching that
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:56.460]   mosquito bite
[00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:58.340]   and I also
[00:17:58.340 --> 00:17:59.700]   have to
[00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:00.660]   admit that
[00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:02.220]   I've experienced
[00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:03.280]   not feeling
[00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:03.760]   like I want
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:04.140]   to pick up
[00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:04.580]   my phone
[00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:05.000]   because it's
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:05.660]   so rewarding
[00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:06.280]   but just
[00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:07.240]   finding myself
[00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:07.800]   doing it
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:08.620]   yes of course
[00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:09.060]   like I'm not
[00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:09.480]   going to use
[00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:09.720]   this thing
[00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:09.960]   I'm not
[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:10.240]   going to use
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:10.620]   this thing
[00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:11.440]   and then
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:11.980]   just finding
[00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:12.340]   myself
[00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:12.680]   doing it
[00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:13.020]   like what
[00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:13.440]   am I doing
[00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:13.660]   here
[00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:14.480]   sort of
[00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:14.960]   the how
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:15.260]   did I
[00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:15.660]   get back
[00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:16.240]   here again
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:17.420]   and I
[00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:18.280]   know enough
[00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:19.000]   about brain
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:19.360]   function
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:20.320]   to understand
[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:20.740]   that we
[00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:21.120]   have
[00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:22.040]   circuits
[00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:22.540]   that
[00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:23.560]   generate
[00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:23.960]   deliberate
[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:24.420]   behavior
[00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:24.700]   and we
[00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:25.080]   have circuits
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:25.580]   that generate
[00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:26.100]   reflexive
[00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:26.420]   behavior
[00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:26.980]   and one
[00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:27.420]   of the
[00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:28.040]   goals
[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:28.380]   of the
[00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:28.640]   nervous
[00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:29.040]   system
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:29.740]   is to
[00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:30.160]   make
[00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:30.580]   the
[00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:30.900]   deliberate
[00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:31.280]   stuff
[00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:31.980]   reflexive
[00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:32.380]   so you
[00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:32.660]   don't have
[00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:32.880]   to make
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:33.340]   the decision
[00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:33.600]   because
[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:33.980]   decision
[00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:34.280]   making
[00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:34.640]   is a
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:35.700]   very costly
[00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:36.440]   thing
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:36.760]   to do
[00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:37.440]   decision
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:37.740]   making
[00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:38.100]   of any
[00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:38.360]   kind
[00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:39.540]   why is
[00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:39.900]   it then
[00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:40.520]   that people
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:41.800]   will relapse
[00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:42.400]   not just
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:43.240]   after getting
[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:43.680]   fired from
[00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:44.100]   a job
[00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:44.400]   or their
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:44.700]   spouse
[00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:44.980]   leaving
[00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:45.120]   them
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:45.460]   but when
[00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:45.780]   things
[00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:46.280]   are going
[00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:46.740]   really
[00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:47.140]   well
[00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:47.560]   is it
[00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:47.820]   this
[00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:48.760]   unconscious
[00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:49.580]   mechanism
[00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:50.200]   because I've
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:50.520]   seen this
[00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:50.940]   before
[00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:51.440]   is
[00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:52.560]   they have
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:52.860]   a great
[00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:53.140]   win
[00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:53.360]   I have
[00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:53.700]   a friend
[00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:53.980]   who's
[00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:54.160]   a
[00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:55.020]   really
[00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:55.500]   impressive
[00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:56.100]   creative
[00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:57.120]   I don't
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:57.600]   want to reveal
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:58.020]   any more
[00:18:58.020 --> 00:18:58.460]   than that
[00:18:58.460 --> 00:18:58.700]   but
[00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:00.700]   and relapsed
[00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:01.880]   upon getting
[00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:02.460]   another
[00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:03.240]   really
[00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:03.820]   terrific
[00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:04.460]   opportunity
[00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:05.080]   to create
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:05.460]   for the
[00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:05.820]   entire
[00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:06.240]   world
[00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:07.200]   and I was
[00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:07.320]   like
[00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:07.740]   how can
[00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:07.900]   that
[00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:08.240]   happen
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:08.880]   but now
[00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:09.040]   I'm
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:09.220]   beginning
[00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:09.600]   to wonder
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:10.020]   was it
[00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:10.500]   the dopamine
[00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:11.060]   associated
[00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:11.520]   with that
[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:11.800]   win
[00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:12.620]   that
[00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:13.440]   opened
[00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:13.980]   the spigot
[00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:14.280]   on this
[00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:14.620]   dopamine
[00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:15.080]   system
[00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:16.280]   because
[00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:17.540]   it
[00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:17.920]   happened
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:18.220]   in a
[00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:18.520]   phase
[00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:19.160]   of a
[00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:19.660]   really
[00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:20.120]   great
[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:20.580]   stretch
[00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:21.300]   of life
[00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:21.780]   yeah
[00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:22.380]   triggers
[00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:22.900]   are things
[00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:23.400]   that
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:24.300]   make us
[00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:25.120]   want to
[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:25.680]   go back
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:26.140]   to using
[00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:26.720]   our drug
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:27.400]   and the
[00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:27.800]   key thing
[00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:28.040]   about
[00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:28.440]   triggers
[00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:28.720]   whatever
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:29.160]   they are
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:29.560]   is they
[00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:30.240]   also
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:30.800]   release
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:31.320]   a little
[00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:31.580]   bit
[00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:31.760]   of
[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:32.180]   dopamine
[00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:32.860]   right
[00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:33.400]   so just
[00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:34.000]   thinking
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:34.660]   about
[00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:36.220]   whatever
[00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:36.480]   the
[00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:36.760]   trigger
[00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:37.140]   is
[00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:37.320]   that
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:37.480]   we
[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:37.860]   associate
[00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:38.160]   with
[00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:38.420]   drug
[00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:38.840]   use
[00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:39.240]   or
[00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:39.460]   just
[00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:39.780]   thinking
[00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:40.100]   about
[00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:40.400]   drug
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:40.800]   use
[00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:41.340]   can
[00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:41.980]   already
[00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:42.420]   release
[00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:42.620]   this
[00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:43.440]   anticipatory
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:43.800]   dopamine
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:44.380]   this little
[00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:45.020]   mini spike
[00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:45.520]   but here's
[00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:45.840]   the part
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:46.280]   that I think
[00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:46.600]   is really
[00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:47.120]   fascinating
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:48.240]   that mini
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:48.640]   spike
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:49.140]   is followed
[00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:49.520]   by a
[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:50.000]   mini
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:50.560]   deficit
[00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:51.020]   state
[00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:51.380]   so it
[00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:51.600]   goes
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:51.920]   up
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:52.420]   and then
[00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:52.520]   it
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:52.780]   doesn't
[00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:53.140]   go back
[00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:53.320]   down
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:53.400]   to
[00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:53.600]   baseline
[00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:53.740]   it
[00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:53.960]   goes
[00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:54.620]   below
[00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:55.360]   baseline
[00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:55.800]   tonic
[00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:56.160]   levels
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:57.020]   and that's
[00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:57.380]   craving
[00:19:57.380 --> 00:19:57.940]   right
[00:19:57.940 --> 00:19:59.220]   so that
[00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:00.000]   anticipation
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.180]   is
[00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:01.740]   immediately
[00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:02.300]   followed
[00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:02.860]   by
[00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:04.320]   wanting
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:04.640]   the
[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:04.960]   drug
[00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:05.400]   and it's
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:05.580]   that
[00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:05.960]   dopamine
[00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:06.320]   deficit
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:06.700]   state
[00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:06.960]   that
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:07.980]   drives
[00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:08.360]   the
[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:09.020]   motivation
[00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:09.780]   to go
[00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:10.200]   and get
[00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:10.400]   the
[00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:10.620]   drug
[00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:10.920]   so many
[00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:11.140]   people
[00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:11.540]   talk about
[00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:11.840]   dopamine
[00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:12.160]   is not
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:12.680]   really about
[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:13.100]   pleasure
[00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:13.940]   but about
[00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:14.620]   wanting
[00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:15.120]   and about
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:15.720]   motivation
[00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:16.720]   and so
[00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:17.080]   it is
[00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:17.280]   that
[00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:17.800]   deficit
[00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:18.260]   state
[00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:18.740]   that then
[00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:19.320]   drives
[00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:19.480]   the
[00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:20.000]   locomotion
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:20.520]   to get
[00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:20.660]   it
[00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:21.320]   and earlier
[00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:21.620]   your
[00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:22.040]   description
[00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:22.240]   of
[00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:22.560]   dopamine
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:22.840]   being
[00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:23.220]   involved
[00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:23.520]   in the
[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:23.900]   desire
[00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:24.480]   for more
[00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:25.120]   giving
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:25.480]   the sense
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:25.820]   of reward
[00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:26.200]   but also
[00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:26.860]   movement
[00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:27.460]   right
[00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:27.800]   I have
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:28.220]   to assume
[00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:28.580]   that those
[00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:28.940]   things are
[00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:29.240]   braided
[00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:29.600]   together
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:29.980]   in our
[00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:30.260]   nervous
[00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:30.620]   system
[00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:31.160]   for the
[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:31.500]   specific
[00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:31.900]   intention
[00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:32.280]   of when
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:32.660]   you feel
[00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:33.120]   something
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.060]   good
[00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:34.820]   then you
[00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:35.100]   feel the
[00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:35.660]   pain
[00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:36.480]   maybe you
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:36.640]   don't
[00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:36.960]   notice
[00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:37.140]   it
[00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:37.480]   and then
[00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:37.760]   the next
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:37.880]   thing
[00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:38.080]   you know
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:38.360]   you're
[00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:38.720]   pursuing
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:39.180]   more
[00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:39.480]   of the
[00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:39.840]   thing
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:40.040]   that
[00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:40.200]   can
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:40.440]   deliver
[00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:40.740]   pleasure
[00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:40.900]   you use
[00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:41.160]   the word
[00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:41.420]   braided
[00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:41.720]   together
[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:42.040]   that's
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:42.360]   beautiful
[00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:42.940]   there are
[00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:43.260]   people
[00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:43.900]   for whom
[00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:44.580]   bad
[00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:44.980]   life
[00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:45.740]   experiences
[00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:46.540]   loss
[00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:47.220]   you know
[00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:47.740]   in any
[00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:48.300]   form
[00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:48.980]   stress
[00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:49.520]   in many
[00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:49.800]   different
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:50.140]   forms
[00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:50.840]   that's
[00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:51.140]   a trigger
[00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:51.600]   but there
[00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:51.900]   are
[00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:52.520]   absolutely
[00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:53.240]   people
[00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:53.800]   for whom
[00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:54.900]   the trigger
[00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:55.600]   is things
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:56.460]   going well
[00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:57.380]   and the
[00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:57.960]   things going
[00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:58.420]   well
[00:20:58.420 --> 00:20:59.300]   can be like
[00:20:59.300 --> 00:20:59.840]   the reward
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:00.140]   of the things
[00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:00.540]   going well
[00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:00.980]   but very
[00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:01.420]   often
[00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:02.120]   what it
[00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:02.460]   is
[00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:02.880]   is the
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:03.320]   removal
[00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:03.860]   of the
[00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:04.720]   hypervigilant
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:05.260]   state
[00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:05.960]   that's
[00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:06.480]   required
[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:07.260]   to keep
[00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:07.860]   their use
[00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:08.340]   in check
[00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:08.720]   so it's
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:09.200]   this sense
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:09.420]   of
[00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:10.360]   I want
[00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:10.900]   to celebrate
[00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:11.520]   you know
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:12.180]   or I want
[00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:12.260]   to
[00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:13.280]   this reward
[00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:13.660]   happened
[00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:14.240]   I want
[00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:14.700]   to put
[00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:15.080]   more
[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:15.620]   reward
[00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:16.180]   on there
[00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:17.000]   and it's
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:17.420]   really
[00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:17.680]   really
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:18.120]   fascinating
[00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:18.520]   because
[00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:19.300]   when people
[00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:19.780]   come to
[00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:19.980]   that
[00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:20.720]   realization
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:21.480]   about
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:22.040]   themselves
[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:22.680]   that
[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:22.880]   they're
[00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:23.420]   most
[00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:24.020]   vulnerable
[00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:24.680]   when
[00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:24.980]   things
[00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:25.100]   are
[00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:25.360]   going
[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:25.940]   well
[00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:27.360]   that's
[00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:27.660]   really
[00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:28.300]   a valuable
[00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:28.720]   insight
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:28.980]   because
[00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:29.240]   then they
[00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:29.560]   can put
[00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:29.820]   some
[00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:30.320]   things
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:30.800]   in place
[00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:31.240]   or barriers
[00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:31.720]   in place
[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:31.980]   or go
[00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:32.340]   to more
[00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:33.040]   meetings
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:33.460]   or whatever
[00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:33.820]   it is
[00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:34.220]   that they
[00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:34.620]   do
[00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:35.640]   to protect
[00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:36.220]   themselves
[00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:37.540]   I wanted
[00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:38.620]   to just
[00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:39.120]   touch on
[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:39.840]   something
[00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:40.280]   that you
[00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:40.620]   mentioned
[00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:41.080]   which is
[00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:41.780]   the shame
[00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:42.880]   I heard
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:43.480]   you say
[00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:44.340]   in an
[00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:44.600]   interview
[00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:44.900]   with
[00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:45.320]   somebody
[00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:45.540]   else
[00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:45.960]   recently
[00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:46.860]   that
[00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:48.240]   truth
[00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:48.640]   telling
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:49.780]   and secrets
[00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:51.060]   are sort
[00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:51.400]   of at the
[00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:51.760]   core
[00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:52.660]   of recovery
[00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:53.960]   and
[00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:55.480]   tell us
[00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:55.920]   more about
[00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:56.280]   that
[00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:57.160]   yeah
[00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:57.680]   so one
[00:21:57.680 --> 00:21:57.920]   of the
[00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:58.140]   things
[00:21:58.140 --> 00:21:58.540]   that I
[00:21:58.540 --> 00:21:59.020]   found
[00:21:59.020 --> 00:21:59.580]   really
[00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:00.540]   fascinating
[00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:00.940]   about
[00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:01.400]   working
[00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:01.840]   with people
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:02.420]   in recovery
[00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:03.060]   was how
[00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:04.300]   telling the
[00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:04.700]   truth
[00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:05.340]   even about
[00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:06.060]   the merest
[00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:06.540]   detail
[00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:06.900]   of their
[00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:07.360]   lives
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:08.320]   was central
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:08.680]   to their
[00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:09.140]   recovery
[00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:09.920]   it's not
[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:10.480]   even just
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:11.140]   not lying
[00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:11.700]   about using
[00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:12.040]   drugs
[00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:12.920]   I have to
[00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:13.420]   not lie
[00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:13.720]   about
[00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:14.240]   anything
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:15.200]   I can't
[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:15.740]   lie about
[00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:16.280]   why I was
[00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:16.680]   late to
[00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:17.080]   work this
[00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:17.240]   morning
[00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:17.540]   which we
[00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:17.980]   all do
[00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:18.580]   oh I hit
[00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:18.900]   traffic
[00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:19.260]   no I
[00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:19.400]   didn't
[00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:19.560]   hit
[00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:19.880]   traffic
[00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:20.240]   I wanted
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:20.580]   to spend
[00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:20.980]   two more
[00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:21.260]   minutes
[00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:21.900]   reading the
[00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:22.140]   paper
[00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:22.480]   and drinking
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:23.140]   my coffee
[00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:23.460]   right
[00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:24.500]   so people
[00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:24.980]   with addiction
[00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:25.280]   will get
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:25.940]   into you know
[00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:26.440]   the lying
[00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:26.720]   habit
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:27.060]   where they're
[00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:27.580]   lying about
[00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:28.220]   random stuff
[00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:28.660]   because they're
[00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:29.120]   sort of in
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:29.520]   the habit
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:30.080]   of lying
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:31.180]   and how
[00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:31.660]   recovery
[00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:32.240]   is really
[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:32.840]   about
[00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:33.280]   telling the
[00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:33.540]   truth
[00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:34.080]   and there's
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:34.360]   really
[00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:34.860]   interesting
[00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:35.340]   neuroscience
[00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:36.480]   behind it
[00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:37.500]   that suggests
[00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:38.340]   that when we
[00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:38.940]   tell the
[00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:39.480]   truth
[00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:40.480]   we actually
[00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:41.140]   potentially
[00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:42.420]   strengthen our
[00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:43.060]   prefrontal
[00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:44.260]   cortical circuits
[00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:45.360]   and their
[00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:46.200]   connections to
[00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:46.740]   our limbic
[00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:47.160]   brain and
[00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:47.740]   our reward
[00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:48.060]   brain
[00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:48.840]   and of course
[00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:49.320]   these are the
[00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:49.860]   circuits that
[00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:50.560]   get disconnected
[00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:51.040]   when we're in
[00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:51.540]   our addiction
[00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:52.120]   right
[00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:53.020]   our balance
[00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:53.400]   in our
[00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:53.700]   reward
[00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:54.060]   pathway
[00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:54.560]   our limbic
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:54.800]   brain
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:55.280]   our emotion
[00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:55.500]   brain
[00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:55.800]   is doing
[00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:56.340]   one thing
[00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:57.140]   and our
[00:22:57.140 --> 00:22:57.920]   cortical circuits
[00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:58.580]   are completely
[00:22:58.580 --> 00:22:59.300]   disengaged
[00:22:59.300 --> 00:22:59.680]   from that
[00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:00.140]   ignoring
[00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:00.440]   what's
[00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:00.680]   happening
[00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:01.040]   which is
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:01.480]   easy to
[00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:01.660]   do
[00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:01.900]   because
[00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:02.100]   it's
[00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:02.680]   reflexive
[00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:03.120]   we don't
[00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:03.680]   need to
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:04.280]   think about
[00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:04.960]   that balance
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:05.220]   for the
[00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:05.520]   balance
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:05.780]   to be
[00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:06.140]   happening
[00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:07.420]   but we
[00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:07.900]   have to
[00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:08.540]   re-engage
[00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:09.280]   those circuits
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:09.940]   anticipate
[00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:10.440]   future
[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:11.100]   consequences
[00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:12.280]   think through
[00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:12.840]   the drink
[00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:13.260]   you know
[00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:14.020]   not just
[00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:14.400]   how am I
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:14.620]   going to
[00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:14.880]   feel
[00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:15.360]   now
[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:15.820]   if I
[00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:16.260]   use
[00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:16.640]   but how
[00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:16.780]   am I
[00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:16.900]   going to
[00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:17.040]   feel
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:17.520]   tomorrow
[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:18.060]   or six
[00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:18.320]   months
[00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:18.720]   from now
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:19.520]   and that
[00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:19.920]   telling
[00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:20.500]   the truth
[00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:20.860]   is in
[00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:21.280]   fact a
[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:21.560]   way
[00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:22.340]   to do
[00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:22.660]   that
[00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:23.160]   to make
[00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:23.440]   these
[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:23.980]   connections
[00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:24.600]   stronger
[00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:24.880]   and there
[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:25.240]   I talk
[00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:25.620]   about some
[00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:26.040]   studies in
[00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:26.320]   my book
[00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:26.540]   that
[00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:27.480]   kind of
[00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:28.000]   indirectly
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:28.760]   show that
[00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:29.340]   so I
[00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:29.720]   find that
[00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:29.900]   really
[00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:30.280]   fascinating
[00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:30.840]   plus
[00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:32.280]   just that
[00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:32.760]   like being
[00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:33.260]   open and
[00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:33.700]   honest with
[00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:34.120]   people
[00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:35.520]   really does
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:36.860]   create very
[00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:37.460]   intimate
[00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:38.460]   connections
[00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:39.440]   and those
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:39.780]   intimate
[00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:40.420]   connections
[00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:41.200]   create
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:41.560]   dopamine
[00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:42.340]   you think
[00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:42.740]   people are
[00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:43.080]   going to run
[00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:43.520]   away from
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:43.960]   you if you
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:44.300]   tell them
[00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:44.720]   about all
[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:45.100]   like your
[00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:45.380]   weird
[00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:45.720]   neuroses
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:46.180]   but really
[00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:47.080]   they don't
[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:47.480]   what they're
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:47.740]   like is
[00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:48.040]   oh thank
[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:48.320]   god
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:48.960]   I'm not
[00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:49.260]   the only
[00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:49.660]   one
[00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:50.080]   right
[00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:50.740]   I love
[00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:51.080]   that there's
[00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:51.580]   neuroscience
[00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:52.520]   being done
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:53.080]   on truth
[00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:53.400]   telling
[00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:53.920]   and the
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:54.280]   value
[00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:54.640]   of truth
[00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:54.840]   telling
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:55.560]   I think
[00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:56.020]   I hope
[00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:56.480]   they'll
[00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:56.820]   continue
[00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:57.060]   to do
[00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:57.260]   more
[00:23:57.260 --> 00:23:57.420]   work
[00:23:57.420 --> 00:23:58.720]   I want
[00:23:58.720 --> 00:23:58.980]   to ask
[00:23:58.980 --> 00:23:59.500]   you about
[00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:00.880]   using drugs
[00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:01.580]   to treat
[00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:02.200]   drug addiction
[00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:03.520]   this is a
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:04.460]   vast area
[00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:04.840]   right
[00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:05.180]   different
[00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:05.700]   chemistries
[00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:06.120]   for different
[00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:06.560]   drugs
[00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:07.200]   and different
[00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:07.560]   purposes
[00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:08.060]   but the
[00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:08.980]   rationale
[00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:09.580]   as I
[00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:10.000]   understand
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:10.480]   it
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:11.320]   is
[00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:12.160]   take
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:12.500]   people
[00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:12.960]   who are
[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:13.560]   in a
[00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:13.980]   pattern
[00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:14.180]   of
[00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:14.540]   addiction
[00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:16.300]   launch
[00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:16.520]   them
[00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:16.900]   into
[00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:17.300]   a
[00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:18.540]   experience
[00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:19.460]   that's
[00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:19.720]   also
[00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:20.200]   chemical
[00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:20.580]   and

[00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:37.600]   but a lot
[00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:38.780]   and then
[00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:39.220]   somehow
[00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:40.180]   that extreme

[00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:48.460]   something
[00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:48.660]   with

[00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:56.060]   use
[00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:56.880]   isn't
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:58.140]   as much
[00:24:58.140 --> 00:24:58.660]   of interest
[00:24:58.660 --> 00:24:59.300]   this
[00:24:59.300 --> 00:24:59.780]   violates
[00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:00.360]   everything
[00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:00.980]   we've talked
[00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:01.360]   about in
[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:01.700]   terms of
[00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:02.000]   dopamine
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:02.560]   biology
[00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:03.680]   it would
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:04.580]   if this
[00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:05.300]   arrangement
[00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:06.060]   is the way
[00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:06.480]   I described
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:06.840]   it
[00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:08.680]   cause
[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:09.140]   more
[00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:09.460]   addiction
[00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:10.100]   is anything
[00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:10.520]   but a
[00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:10.860]   dopamine
[00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:11.260]   fast
[00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:11.600]   it's a
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:11.920]   dopamine
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:12.560]   feast
[00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:14.040]   so
[00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:15.100]   we hear
[00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:15.420]   about
[00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:15.980]   successful
[00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:16.940]   transitions
[00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:17.260]   through
[00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:17.540]   this
[00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:17.940]   at least
[00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:18.860]   anecdotally
[00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:19.200]   and may
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:20.040]   maybe
[00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:20.740]   say
[00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:21.320]   what
[00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:21.980]   is
[00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:22.300]   going
[00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:22.760]   on
[00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:24.440]   what
[00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:24.640]   is
[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:24.880]   going
[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:25.200]   on
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:25.580]   doesn't
[00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:25.720]   make
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:25.960]   any
[00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:26.240]   sense
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:26.680]   to me
[00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:27.420]   yeah
[00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:28.160]   so
[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:28.700]   I think
[00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:29.060]   it's
[00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:29.280]   good
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:29.500]   that
[00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:29.720]   you're
[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:30.220]   skeptical
[00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:31.140]   I think
[00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:31.540]   we all
[00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:31.780]   should
[00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:31.980]   be
[00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:32.480]   skeptical
[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:33.520]   having
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:33.900]   said
[00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:34.420]   that
[00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:35.580]   there
[00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:36.000]   are
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:36.520]   clinical
[00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:37.220]   studies

[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:39.800]   and these
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:40.200]   are small
[00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:40.620]   studies
[00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:40.960]   and they're
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:41.200]   short
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:41.680]   duration
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:42.380]   small

[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:44.760]   you know
[00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:45.020]   taking
[00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:45.320]   people
[00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:45.780]   for example
[00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:46.360]   who are
[00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:47.160]   addicted

[00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:48.840]   and then
[00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:49.340]   having
[00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:49.600]   them
[00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:49.980]   have
[00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:50.460]   this
[00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:50.980]   let's
[00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:51.100]   say
[00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:51.680]   psychedelic
[00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:52.140]   experience

[00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:54.480]   setting
[00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:54.680]   so
[00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:54.860]   either
[00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:55.320]   typically
[00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:55.580]   it's
[00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:55.720]   a

[00:25:57.860 --> 00:25:58.440]   as I
[00:25:58.440 --> 00:25:58.820]   saw it
[00:25:58.820 --> 00:25:59.160]   for the

[00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:03.340]   to be

[00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:07.000]   but
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:07.160]   the
[00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:07.440]   thing
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:07.660]   to
[00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:07.920]   really
[00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:08.220]   keep
[00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:08.400]   in
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:08.700]   mind
[00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:09.000]   is
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:09.320]   that
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:09.680]   this
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:09.920]   is
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:10.720]   completely
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:11.720]   interwoven
[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:12.580]   with
[00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:13.300]   regular
[00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:14.240]   psychotherapy
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:15.120]   and that
[00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:15.480]   these are
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:15.980]   highly
[00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:16.660]   selected
[00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:17.420]   individuals
[00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:17.840]   and
[00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:18.200]   clinical
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:18.620]   trials
[00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:18.880]   right
[00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:19.100]   right
[00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:21.820]   when it
[00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:22.380]   works
[00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:23.020]   it's
[00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:23.320]   a
[00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:24.280]   transformational
[00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:24.900]   experience
[00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:25.320]   because
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:26.460]   it
[00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:26.900]   gives
[00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:27.480]   the
[00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:27.880]   person
[00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:28.620]   another
[00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:29.420]   lens
[00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:30.480]   to view
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:30.680]   their
[00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:31.200]   lives
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:32.800]   which
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:33.200]   I
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:33.560]   think
[00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:34.200]   for
[00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:34.480]   some
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:34.800]   people
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:35.080]   is
[00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:35.520]   positive
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:35.720]   and
[00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:36.140]   powerful
[00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:37.000]   because
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:37.200]   they
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:37.380]   can
[00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:37.820]   come back
[00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:38.120]   from that
[00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:38.360]   and be
[00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:38.640]   like
[00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:39.580]   oh my
[00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:40.020]   gosh
[00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:40.640]   I
[00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:41.260]   care
[00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:41.880]   about
[00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:42.120]   my
[00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:42.560]   family
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:43.400]   and I
[00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:44.060]   don't
[00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:44.520]   I want
[00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:44.980]   X Y
[00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:45.240]   or Z
[00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:45.620]   for them
[00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:45.860]   and I
[00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:46.140]   realize
[00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:46.520]   that my
[00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:46.920]   continuing
[00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:47.400]   to drink
[00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:47.840]   is not
[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:48.720]   going to
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:50.100]   achieve that
[00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:51.160]   so it's
[00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:51.780]   almost like
[00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:52.560]   a spiritual
[00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:53.800]   or values
[00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:54.300]   based
[00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:55.260]   so I think
[00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:56.000]   it can be
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:56.500]   very powerful
[00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:57.180]   but having
[00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:57.720]   said that
[00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:58.760]   I truly
[00:26:58.760 --> 00:26:59.260]   am quite
[00:26:59.260 --> 00:26:59.780]   skeptical
[00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:00.920]   because
[00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:02.100]   you know
[00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:02.500]   addiction
[00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:02.940]   is a
[00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:03.280]   chronic
[00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:03.920]   relapsing
[00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:04.300]   and remitting
[00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:04.760]   problem
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:05.200]   it's hard
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:05.420]   for me
[00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:05.800]   to imagine
[00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:06.640]   that there's
[00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:07.240]   something that
[00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:07.940]   works very
[00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:08.660]   quickly short
[00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:09.020]   term
[00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:09.780]   that's going
[00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:10.200]   to work
[00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:11.380]   for a
[00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:11.740]   disease
[00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:12.140]   that's
[00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:12.440]   really
[00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:12.820]   long
[00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:13.380]   lasting
[00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:13.860]   yeah
[00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:14.220]   the two
[00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:14.660]   addicts
[00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:15.000]   I know
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:15.760]   that did
[00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:16.320]   MDMA
[00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:17.440]   assisted
[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:18.140]   psychotherapy
[00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:18.520]   as part
[00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:19.620]   of this
[00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:20.160]   thing
[00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:20.660]   both got
[00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:21.140]   worse
[00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:21.760]   yeah
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:23.360]   but the
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:23.740]   people I
[00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:23.960]   know
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:24.660]   who had
[00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:25.160]   severe
[00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:25.700]   trauma
[00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:26.860]   who did
[00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:27.180]   this
[00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:27.640]   who took
[00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:27.820]   this
[00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:28.220]   approach
[00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:29.120]   seem to
[00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:29.460]   be doing
[00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:29.820]   better
[00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:30.180]   okay
[00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:31.120]   and so
[00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:31.400]   I
[00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:32.920]   I think
[00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:33.120]   that
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:33.820]   the
[00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:34.260]   discussion
[00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:34.740]   as we
[00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:35.020]   hear it
[00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:35.260]   now
[00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:35.540]   is just
[00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:35.840]   sort of
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:36.600]   psychedelics
[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:37.220]   which is
[00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:37.580]   a huge
[00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:38.120]   category
[00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:38.900]   that includes
[00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:39.680]   many different
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:40.400]   drugs and
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:40.820]   compounds
[00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:41.160]   with different
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:41.440]   effects
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:42.980]   and we
[00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:43.520]   hear about
[00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:44.100]   trauma and
[00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:44.500]   addiction
[00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:45.080]   lumped
[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:45.500]   together
[00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:46.380]   and I
[00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:46.740]   think it's
[00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:47.020]   going to be
[00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:47.700]   important
[00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:48.580]   for people
[00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:49.460]   to know
[00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:50.500]   that this
[00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:51.060]   is definitely
[00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:52.580]   not a
[00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:53.680]   one-size-fits-all
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:55.040]   kind of thing
[00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:55.680]   but it sounds
[00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:56.180]   like it may
[00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:56.600]   have some
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:57.440]   utility under
[00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:58.460]   certain conditions
[00:27:58.460 --> 00:27:59.380]   yeah I think
[00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:00.220]   so I think
[00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:01.120]   we I'm trying
[00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:01.560]   to be very
[00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:02.180]   open-minded
[00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:02.780]   about its
[00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:03.760]   potential utility
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:04.520]   for certain
[00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:05.020]   individuals
[00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:06.320]   but I can tell
[00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:06.760]   you in my
[00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:07.400]   clinical work
[00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:08.000]   what is a
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:08.920]   very concerning
[00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:10.040]   unintended
[00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:11.220]   consequence of
[00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:12.080]   this narrative
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:13.440]   is I have a
[00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:14.100]   lot of people
[00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:14.960]   who are looking
[00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:15.560]   for some kind
[00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:16.080]   of spiritual
[00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:16.520]   awakening
[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:17.140]   who on
[00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:17.800]   their own
[00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:18.560]   not in the
[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:19.340]   context of any
[00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:19.700]   kind of
[00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:20.220]   therapeutic
[00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:21.120]   psychological
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:21.520]   work
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:22.080]   you know
[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:23.080]   microdose
[00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:24.120]   or want
[00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:24.680]   to try
[00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:25.000]   you know
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:25.740]   psilocybin
[00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:26.660]   or MDMA
[00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:27.920]   with a friend
[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:28.520]   or wherever
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:28.940]   so they can
[00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:29.340]   have this
[00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:29.620]   you know
[00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:30.120]   spiritual
[00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:30.700]   experience
[00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:30.940]   that they
[00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:31.320]   can figure
[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:31.660]   out their
[00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:31.940]   lives
[00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:33.000]   that's a
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:33.480]   disaster
[00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:34.580]   and almost
[00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:35.560]   never works
[00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:36.080]   out well
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:36.580]   and I can
[00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:37.120]   just tell you
[00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:37.500]   that the
[00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:38.180]   downstream
[00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:39.580]   effect for
[00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:40.340]   the average
[00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:40.940]   person
[00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:41.900]   is that
[00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:42.280]   they've
[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:43.580]   misconstrued
[00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:44.420]   the data
[00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:45.900]   on the use
[00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:46.840]   of psychedelics
[00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:47.460]   for mental
[00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:47.700]   health
[00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:48.180]   conditions
[00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:49.820]   to this
[00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:50.500]   idea that
[00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:51.400]   they're safe
[00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:51.740]   or that
[00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:52.300]   anybody can
[00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:52.640]   take them
[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:52.900]   in any
[00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:53.360]   circumstance
[00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:54.020]   and have
[00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:54.800]   this kind
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:55.340]   of awakening
[00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:56.660]   and that
[00:28:56.660 --> 00:28:57.120]   that's not
[00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:57.400]   what the
[00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:58.260]   data show
[00:28:58.260 --> 00:28:58.520]   right
[00:28:58.520 --> 00:28:58.880]   the data
[00:28:58.880 --> 00:28:59.240]   are these
[00:28:59.240 --> 00:28:59.860]   highly
[00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:00.480]   controlled
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:01.120]   settings
[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:02.120]   there are
[00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:02.440]   a couple
[00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:03.080]   other things
[00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:03.500]   I just want
[00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:03.980]   to touch
[00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:04.360]   on
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:05.960]   but they
[00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:06.460]   all relate
[00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:06.960]   to social
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:07.300]   media
[00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:07.780]   okay
[00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:08.560]   I have
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:08.980]   to imagine
[00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:09.760]   that we
[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:10.260]   need to
[00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:10.760]   regulate
[00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:11.380]   not
[00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:12.080]   necessarily
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:12.740]   eliminate
[00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:13.500]   this
[00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:13.960]   behavior
[00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:14.520]   how
[00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:15.040]   addicting
[00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:15.720]   is it
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:16.320]   and
[00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:17.400]   what
[00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:18.020]   is
[00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:18.480]   healthy
[00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:18.960]   social
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:19.240]   media
[00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:19.720]   behavior
[00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:20.380]   the
[00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:21.020]   first
[00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:22.380]   message
[00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:22.800]   I would
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:23.080]   want to
[00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:23.560]   get across
[00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:24.140]   about social
[00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:24.420]   media
[00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:24.900]   is that
[00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:25.140]   it
[00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:25.560]   really
[00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:26.260]   is a
[00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:26.560]   drug
[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:27.300]   and it's
[00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:27.640]   engineered
[00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:28.020]   to be
[00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:28.400]   a drug
[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:28.900]   which
[00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:29.460]   doesn't
[00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:29.740]   mean
[00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:30.060]   that
[00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:30.380]   we
[00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:30.840]   can't
[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:31.200]   use
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:31.520]   it
[00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:32.100]   but
[00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:32.280]   we
[00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:32.500]   need
[00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:32.640]   to
[00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:32.780]   be
[00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:33.020]   very
[00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:33.520]   thoughtful
[00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:33.860]   about
[00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:34.020]   the
[00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:34.180]   way
[00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:34.620]   we
[00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:35.120]   use
[00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:35.240]   it
[00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:35.500]   and
[00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:35.680]   so
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:35.900]   that
[00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:36.360]   means
[00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:36.880]   with
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:37.440]   intention

[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:40.580]   use
[00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:41.220]   right
[00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:41.460]   and
[00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:41.780]   trying
[00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:42.020]   to
[00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:42.280]   use
[00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:42.680]   it
[00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:43.180]   as
[00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:43.600]   a
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:44.300]   really
[00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:45.000]   awesome
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:45.780]   tool
[00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:46.360]   to

[00:29:58.760 --> 00:29:59.540]   something
[00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:00.420]   that's
[00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:00.660]   you know
[00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:00.860]   going to
[00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:01.200]   be good
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:01.640]   for us
[00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:02.160]   and not
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:02.580]   ultimately
[00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:03.120]   harmful
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:03.680]   as
[00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:04.100]   more
[00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:04.420]   and more
[00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:04.900]   of us
[00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:05.040]   are
[00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:05.360]   spending
[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:05.700]   more
[00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:05.920]   and more
[00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:06.220]   time
[00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:06.400]   on
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:06.700]   social
[00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:07.040]   media
[00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:07.780]   we're
[00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:08.540]   divesting
[00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:08.980]   our
[00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:09.680]   libidness
[00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:10.220]   energies
[00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:10.860]   etc
[00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:11.760]   from
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:12.200]   real
[00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:12.440]   life
[00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:13.000]   interactions
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:13.660]   so I
[00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:13.920]   think
[00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:14.160]   our
[00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:14.720]   collective
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:15.760]   challenge
[00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:16.500]   and it
[00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:16.860]   should be
[00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:17.240]   our
[00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:17.860]   mission
[00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:18.780]   is to
[00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:19.500]   make sure
[00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:20.460]   that we
[00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:20.680]   are
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:21.300]   preserving
[00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:21.820]   and
[00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:22.320]   maintaining
[00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:23.720]   offline
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:24.900]   ways to
[00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:25.300]   connect
[00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:25.840]   with each
[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:26.140]   other
[00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:26.640]   so this
[00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:26.980]   is the
[00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:27.200]   key
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:27.620]   you have
[00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:27.840]   to
[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:28.260]   with
[00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:28.820]   intention
[00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:29.980]   prior to
[00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:30.400]   being in
[00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:30.580]   that
[00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:31.140]   situation
[00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:31.880]   think
[00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:31.880]   think
[00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:31.900]   think
[00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:32.220]   of
[00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:32.880]   literal
[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:33.460]   physical
[00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:33.720]   and
[00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:34.360]   metacognitive
[00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:34.900]   barriers
[00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:35.260]   that you
[00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:35.640]   can put
[00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:36.000]   between
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:36.480]   yourself
[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:37.620]   and your
[00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:38.200]   phone
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:38.660]   or whatever
[00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:39.440]   your drug
[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:39.740]   is
[00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:40.580]   to create
[00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:41.060]   these
[00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:41.860]   intentional
[00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:42.440]   spaces
[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:42.820]   where you're
[00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:43.080]   not
[00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:43.960]   constantly
[00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:45.080]   interrupting
[00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:45.580]   yourself
[00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:46.060]   essentially
[00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:46.760]   and distracting
[00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:47.120]   yourself
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:47.460]   because I
[00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:47.840]   really do
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:48.160]   think
[00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:48.480]   we're
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:48.820]   losing
[00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:49.460]   the ability
[00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:50.080]   to have
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:51.040]   a sustained
[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:51.760]   thought
[00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:52.400]   right
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:52.620]   I mean
[00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:53.080]   we get
[00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:53.780]   so far
[00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:54.320]   and then
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:55.240]   then you
[00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:55.520]   get to
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:56.020]   that point
[00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:56.440]   in the
[00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:56.760]   thought
[00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:57.180]   where
[00:30:57.180 --> 00:30:58.280]   it's a
[00:30:58.280 --> 00:30:58.600]   little bit
[00:30:58.600 --> 00:30:59.120]   hard to
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:30:59.500]   know what's
[00:30:59.500 --> 00:30:59.720]   coming
[00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:00.140]   next
[00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:00.660]   and it's
[00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:01.400]   very easy
[00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:01.800]   to
[00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:02.920]   check your
[00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:03.240]   phone
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:03.900]   or check
[00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:04.320]   your email
[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:05.420]   or look
[00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:05.960]   something up
[00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:06.580]   on you
[00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:06.820]   know the
[00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:07.160]   internet
[00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:08.540]   and then
[00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:09.100]   you never
[00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:09.660]   get that
[00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:10.240]   opportunity
[00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:11.560]   to finish
[00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:12.200]   that thought
[00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:12.520]   which is
[00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:13.040]   really the
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:13.660]   source of
[00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:14.500]   creative energy
[00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:15.220]   and an
[00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:16.100]   original thought
[00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:16.340]   right
[00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:16.580]   you're not
[00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:17.300]   just reacting
[00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:17.760]   to
[00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:18.140]   right
[00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:18.700]   and something
[00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:19.100]   that could
[00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:19.460]   contribute
[00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:19.820]   to the
[00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:20.060]   world
[00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:20.720]   I know
[00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:21.020]   a number

[00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:21.460]   are going
[00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:21.700]   to have
[00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:22.260]   questions
[00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:22.560]   and want
[00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:22.760]   to get
[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:23.240]   in contact
[00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:23.800]   with you
[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:24.240]   you are
[00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:24.780]   not on
[00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:25.440]   social media
[00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:26.280]   that's
