[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.340]   - For me, the most anticipated message of the year
[00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.420]   from John Piper comes in his annual message
[00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.060]   at the Passion Conference in early January.
[00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.220]   And this year in Atlanta, he preached on Revelation 13
[00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:16.400]   in a message titled,
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.200]   "The Beast, the Book, and the Beauty of the Lamb."
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.040]   He did not disappoint.
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.080]   And we talked about it a little bit last Wednesday.
[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.960]   But the entire message is worth listening to,
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.560]   and you can find it on our site, of course.
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.000]   But here's a clip of him explaining his greatest fear,
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.840]   his greatest hope, and his greatest delight.
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.720]   It's all in the context of understanding what it means
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.020]   that Christ died for us,
[00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.980]   and that our names are found in the book of life.
[00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.740]   Here's Pastor John.
[00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.360]   - There are three purposes.
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.280]   What does it mean for you personally?
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.080]   Did you see yourself there?
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.040]   What does it mean for you that the Lamb was slain
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.920]   in the mind of God in eternity past?
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.440]   What does it mean for you that you were purchased
[00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.280]   in the center of history?
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.480]   And what does it mean for you that you'll be singing
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.980]   if your names are in the book?
[00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.080]   Three things.
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.280]   Number one, your name is in the book
[00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.960]   so that you will see the glory of the Lamb.
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.240]   Seeing the Lamb as beautiful
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.980]   is the great vocation of the Christian.
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.960]   This is the fountain of all the godliness in your life,
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.840]   seeing the Lamb as supremely beautiful
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.100]   and satisfying and compelling.
[00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.640]   The devil knows this.
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.920]   And that's why Paul said in 2 Corinthians 4:4,
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.280]   "Satan has blinded the minds of unbelievers
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.700]   "to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel
[00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.960]   "of the glory of Christ."
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.240]   (audience laughing)
[00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.600]   This is the most terrifying thing in the world to me,
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:07.040]   that people I love or myself may be so blinded
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.400]   by the devil that they look at Jesus
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.840]   and he is not beautiful.
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.160]   He's not their treasure.
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.280]   Money is their treasure.
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.700]   Videos are their treasure.
[00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.320]   Making grades are their treasure.
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.040]   The boyfriend is their treasure.
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.960]   That to me is the most terrifying thing in the world.
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.380]   Death is not terrifying.
[00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.180]   To be so deceived that you can't see Jesus
[00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.240]   as the treasure of your life,
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.480]   that's the most terrifying thing.
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.480]   The great, first, decisive result of being in the book
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:51.580]   is that Jesus is beautiful to you.
[00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.460]   You see him for who he is.
[00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.160]   That's the effect of being in the book.
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:07.780]   So the risen lamb says to us in Revelation 1:18,
[00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.560]   "I died and see, I am alive forevermore.
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.280]   "See."
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.340]   It's a command.
[00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.980]   Revelation 5:5, the elder says to John,
[00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.180]   "Weep no more.
[00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.100]   "See, the lion of the tribe of Judah has conquered."
[00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.500]   Revelation 22, seven, the lamb says,
[00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.280]   "See, I am coming soon.
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.740]   "See, I'm alive.
[00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.160]   "See, I conquered.
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.620]   "See, I'm coming."
[00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:39.460]   Do you?
[00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.100]   Do you see?
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.860]   To be in the book is to see.
[00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:58.300]   And then in chapter one, he tells us what he saw
[00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.880]   when he looked at the risen lamb.
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.300]   His eyes were like a flame of fire.
[00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:10.100]   His feet were like burnished bronze, refined in a furnace.
[00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.100]   His voice was like the roar of many waters.
[00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.380]   In his right hand, he held seven stars.
[00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.140]   From his mouth came a sharp two-edged sword,
[00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:27.140]   and his face was like the sun, shining in full strength.
[00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:34.320]   The first and decisive effect of being
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.460]   in the book of life of the lamb that was slain
[00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.460]   is that you see the lamb as supremely precious.
[00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:44.660]   Precious.
[00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.940]   More than anything else in your life.
[00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.060]   Do you?
[00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:56.220]   Second, this means that since your name is in the book,
[00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:02.860]   you will live and die humbly and happily
[00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.540]   to show that Jesus is more precious than life.
[00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.660]   So I'm moving from seeing to showing.
[00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.620]   First effect of being in the book is you see.
[00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.460]   Second effect of being in the book is that you live
[00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:23.420]   and you die humbly and happily
[00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:28.680]   in order to show Jesus is more precious than life.
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.780]   If your name is in the book,
[00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:36.340]   your calling is not to stay alive, but to stay in love.
[00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:40.660]   Death is a small thing compared to hell,
[00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.000]   a very small thing.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.140]   So many today that are trying to figure out ways,
[00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:53.340]   we're gonna keep ourselves alive, gonna take them out.
[00:05:53.340 --> 00:06:02.380]   If you're in the book, that's not your goal.
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:09.680]   The purpose of being in the book,
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:14.680]   of being known, appointed, loved, purchased, singing,
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:19.120]   the point is not to keep yourself alive,
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.800]   but to keep yourself in love with Jesus,
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.080]   to love Jesus so much, nothing, not even death,
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.520]   will stop it.
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:32.640]   This is the spirit that must run in our day.
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.440]   We're ready to die for the world.
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:39.000]   We don't kill for the world, we die for the world.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.780]   That's what Christians do.
[00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:46.180]   We keep ourselves in love, we don't keep ourselves alive.
[00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:52.920]   And by your life, humble, happy,
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.620]   by your death, humble, happy,
[00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:00.620]   the lamb is seen to be more precious than anything.
[00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.720]   Isn't that the way it works?
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:06.960]   If you can die happily in fellowship and security
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:11.720]   with Jesus, you make him look really good, really precious.
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:15.920]   But if you are, at any cost, you're not killing me,
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.320]   what does that show?
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:21.000]   Like, you're just like everybody, that's what it shows.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.280]   The world will not rise up and say,
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.360]   tell me the reason for the hope that is in you.
[00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:28.760]   They'll know where the hope that is in you,
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.400]   it's in your holster, that's where it is.
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.520]   - Yes, such a great clip from a message
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:34.560]   you don't wanna miss, titled,
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.800]   The Beast, the Book, and the Beauty of the Lamb,
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.240]   based on Revelation chapter 13, verses one to 10,
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:42.380]   and preached on January 3rd at the Passion Conference
[00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:44.460]   in Atlanta, Georgia.
[00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:45.880]   The entire message, audio, and video
[00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:49.440]   can be found right now at DesiringGod.org.
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:52.200]   Well, Paul says that God's invisible attributes
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.800]   are made plain and obvious to everyone,
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.880]   so what exactly does that mean?
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:57.920]   That question is on the table
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:00.400]   as John Piper joins us again tomorrow.
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.640]   For everything you need to know related to this podcast,

[00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:14.760]   (upbeat music)
