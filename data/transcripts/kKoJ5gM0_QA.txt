[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.640]   - Let's talk about the conversation
[00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.060]   around money and your partner.
[00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.320]   We've already covered the emotional side of it
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.080]   in my conversation with Ramit,
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.960]   but I haven't had any conversation on this show ever
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.240]   about pre-nups and post-nups and that whole can of worms.
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.120]   And I know you have and have lots of opinions.
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.160]   So for anyone who's either in that situation,
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.120]   will be in it, regrets not having been in it,
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.560]   what advice do you have for people to think about?
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.960]   - Man, we need to stop making the pre-nup a big deal.
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.400]   That is my first and foremost soapbox on this topic
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.880]   is that pre-nups are one of the biggest remaining taboos,
[00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.900]   I feel, when it comes to money conversations.
[00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.560]   Because to just say the word, like people are like,
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.040]   cursed, how dare you get a pre-nup?
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.100]   Your marriage is gonna fail.
[00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.320]   You do not trust and love your spouse
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.120]   if you want a pre-nup.
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.680]   - All right, here's my multi-prong attack
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.560]   on people who are currently listening to this
[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.360]   and feeling that way.
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.920]   First and foremost, as my pre-nup attorney said to me,
[00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.720]   because yes, I do indeed have a pre-nup,
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.960]   is that everyone has a pre-nup,
[00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.000]   it's just the default laws of your state.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.240]   What a great reframe.
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.120]   So technically, there is a pre-nup in place for you
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.320]   if you didn't get one yourself,
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.240]   and it's just based on how your state
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.760]   would divide assets in the case of a divorce.
[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.100]   All right, fair enough.
[00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.700]   You should look at those state laws
[00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.340]   prior to getting married to see if that feels fair to you
[00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.160]   and the ecosystem of your relationship.
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.780]   And if it doesn't, you should get a pre-nup,
[00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.900]   because that'll account for what actually feels fair to you
[00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.340]   within reason.
[00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.180]   You can't just do like anything you want in a pre-nup.
[00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.200]   There are rules and stipulations.
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.240]   But within reason, you can take back some level of control.
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.220]   The other thing is,
[00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.340]   I really just think of it as marital insurance.
[00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.740]   And I think of it that way because again,
[00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.040]   a lot of times people will say like,
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.040]   oh, if you get a pre-nup,
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.840]   it means that you don't love or trust your partner.
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.240]   Well, I don't have renter's insurance
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.560]   because I think that I'm gonna get burglarized.
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.760]   I don't have car insurance
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:12.000]   because I think I'm gonna get into an accident.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   I have those things just in case the bad thing does happen,
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.320]   then I'm protected.
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.120]   So again, I kind of think of pre-nups in a very similar way,
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.840]   that it is an insurance policy on my marriage.
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.840]   I didn't get married thinking,
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.440]   well, this could go sideways and we could get divorced.
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.680]   I got married thinking this is my person forever,
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.120]   but life is long.
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.840]   And if something happens
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.400]   and we're no longer happy being married,
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.760]   then I have an insurance policy
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.280]   that will make it much easier to get divorced.
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.640]   And we will have made decisions
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.400]   about what feels fair and equitable
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.880]   at a point where we're very much in love
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.080]   and we'll have been kind to each other.
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.600]   And it will save so much money on the cost of a divorce.
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.440]   Divorce can be so expensive.
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.080]   And also no one talks about that part.
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.160]   And then finally, for those of you listening
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.280]   who are thinking, well, I just never leave my spouse.
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.360]   Listen, people think that for myriad reasons.
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.960]   It could be religiously, societal pressure,
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.240]   cultural pressure, personal feelings.
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.520]   You just would never leave this person
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.320]   no matter what happened.
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.760]   Well, you can't control what they will do.
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.160]   They could leave you.
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.040]   And that's always really hard to hear.
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.480]   But again, to have a document in place
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.640]   that stipulates what feels fair to you is important.
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.880]   Because finally, everyone listening here
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.880]   would not sign a contract for a business agreement
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.880]   or anything in the business realm.
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.600]   You would never join a partnership with a friend
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.920]   without having a contract about what feels fair
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.280]   and deciding what would also happen
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.960]   if things were to go south.
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.640]   Why are we all signing this very legally binding agreement
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.720]   that has huge financial implications
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.480]   without reading the fine print?
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.560]   And that is one thing too
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.000]   that I think about a marriage license
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.280]   is that's one of the biggest financial decisions
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.240]   you might ever make in your life.
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.720]   Why are we not knowing the terms and conditions
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.080]   prior to signing?
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.280]   - One thing that never crossed my mind
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.880]   with what you just said was that,
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.560]   I have at least a few friends now
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.880]   that have gone through the process of divorce.
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.720]   And even when amicable, it is very expensive.
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.720]   And I've always just put prenups in the light of
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.800]   this is a thing to make sure that you protect money
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.600]   in a situation where one person has more
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.960]   or might have more or something.
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.960]   That's the idea.
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.040]   But is there a world where someone could say,
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.520]   "Look, I believe that if we ever get divorced,
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.360]   "we should split everything 50/50,
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.480]   "but we should still have a prenup
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.160]   "so that if it happens, it just is a simple process."
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.840]   In the way that an estate plan might avoid
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.280]   the messy process of probate,
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.000]   but it might not change,
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.680]   you could decide how things get affected.
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.760]   Could a prenup just be something that adheres
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.360]   to the same process as what you'd thought
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.320]   what the state would do,
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.480]   but just does it more efficiently
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.880]   and saves you on attorney fees?
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.640]   - I would talk to an attorney about that before.
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.200]   I'm gonna be like, "Yeah, absolutely."
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.840]   'Cause again, so much varies by state.
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.920]   If you live in a community property state,
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.800]   your divorce might actually be easier
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.160]   if you're not gonna contest anything
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.240]   'cause they're usually just like,
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.360]   "50/50, down the middle, let's go.
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.080]   "It doesn't matter why."
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.120]   So again, knowing the laws of the land
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.160]   could impact whether or not you need one
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.040]   in the first place, if it feels super fair,
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.600]   and you also can see a world
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.480]   where you can get through a divorce quick and easy
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.880]   with minimal amount of pain and suffering financially.
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.440]   'Cause if that stuff drags out,
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.360]   it is so expensive.
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.280]   But the other part, I sometimes feel like
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.400]   it's a bit of a misconception
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.800]   that a prenup is just to protect the one person
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.360]   who brings in all of the assets.
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.800]   Yes, obviously, if you come from wealth
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.480]   or you've already created wealth,
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.120]   those are two key reasons that you would want a prenup.
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.880]   A third being if you have a child
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.120]   from a preexisting relationship,
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.840]   that's another good reason to have a prenup,
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.040]   to protect the financial interests of your child.
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.760]   But it also can be about
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.400]   what would happen to, let's say, retirement accounts.
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.920]   Those are often forgotten about in these conversations.
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.960]   So even if you haven't accumulated
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.040]   a bunch of assets going in,
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.360]   if you have one that you know has the potential
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.760]   to get pretty significant over, let's say,
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.520]   10, 15, 20 years of a marriage,
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.320]   those are often some of the first assets
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.000]   to get completely gouged in a divorce.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.480]   So even just having a prenup
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.960]   that might be as simple as
[00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.920]   we're protecting our retirement accounts,
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.280]   we each just have the right to our own retirement account,
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.440]   we don't have rights to each other,
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.040]   that might be something that saves you
[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.560]   a ton of money in the future.
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.560]   Now, a prenup isn't cheap.
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.120]   I look at it as an upfront lump sum
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.960]   on an insurance policy.
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.040]   So again, that amount of money
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.240]   might not feel good to you for doing something
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:01.320]   just like exclusively protecting a retirement plan.
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.840]   But if we wanna talk post-nups,
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.360]   this also might be an opportunity
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.520]   to bring that up with a spouse
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.600]   and post-nups are a really hard sell
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:13.920]   if you have not previously had the prenup conversation.
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.640]   I actually know a couple of people
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:17.160]   who wanted to have a prenup,
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.360]   just kind of ran the clock down on getting it done
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.960]   and then got married and had a post-nup instead.
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.960]   That's an easier pitch.
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.160]   You know, if you're 10, 15 years into your marriage
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.000]   and all of a sudden you're like,
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.520]   "Oh, post-nup sounds like a great plan,"
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.520]   and you pitch that to your spouse,
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.560]   it might sound like you're preparing to divorce them.
[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.360]   So it's a much harder sell to be like,
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.560]   "Let's have a post-nuptial agreement."
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.480]   - But I guess conceptually you can make these changes
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.280]   at any point in time, it sounds like.
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.240]   It doesn't have to be done before marriage.
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:46.080]   - You can.
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:49.400]   And honestly, a lot of prenups should, again,
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:52.400]   like all the documents we've been talking about already,
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.520]   you should check in on that from time to time
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:55.560]   just in the sense of,
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:59.760]   has something big shifted in your marriage?
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:02.280]   So if you had outlined something in the prenup
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:03.880]   that now no longer feels fair
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:06.640]   based on the current ecosystem of your relationship,
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:08.440]   it might be time for a post-nup.
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:09.920]   And that could be something like,
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:13.560]   hey, if the two of you waived alimony in your prenup,
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:16.400]   but you're 10 years in, you've had two kids,
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.960]   and one of you has left the workforce
[00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:19.520]   for an extended period of time,
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.320]   that doesn't feel so fair anymore
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:23.320]   that you waived alimony in the prenup.
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.720]   So it might warrant having a post-nup
[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.400]   to compensate for that.
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:30.760]   Or maybe you had kids and now you feel like the finances
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.840]   are a little bit of a different conversation,
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:34.920]   or maybe somebody, Bill Perkins style,
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:37.360]   received a lump sum inheritance early,
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:38.800]   and you bought property with it,
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.240]   and you wanna have a post-nup that accounts for
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:44.280]   who has rights to that property in the case of a divorce.
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:46.680]   - I know some people whose parents have asked
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:50.680]   to set up a post-nup as part of pre-inheritance.
[00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:52.560]   But a situation that you just alluded to
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.600]   that I thought was something that
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:57.360]   I'd never really thought about a prenup in this perspective
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.480]   was someone, one of the spouses
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:00.600]   was going to leave the workforce
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.520]   to take care of kids full time.
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:05.480]   And that would, in the future,
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:08.000]   kind of hinder their ability to earn income, right?
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.320]   They'd be out of the workforce maybe five, 10 years,
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.320]   they would be out of their career track.
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.320]   And so at that point in time,
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:15.920]   they actually talked about,
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:17.720]   can we set up something different?
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:20.400]   Because my ability, were we to get divorced,
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.280]   to go get a job is different going forward than it is now.
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:26.360]   So that was a point in time where someone brought that up,
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:28.480]   where it felt a little more natural
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:29.800]   than just out of the blue.
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:33.320]   - I haven't thought or done any of this stuff.
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.920]   Just, you know, we've never crossed our minds.
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.720]   And now, you know, it's something,
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.280]   I don't even know how I'm gonna think about it.
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.040]   Like you just threw this at me,
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:43.240]   like you're crazy to have not done something.
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:45.760]   I respect your opinion and I haven't done it.
[00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:48.600]   And I'm still have this like weird undertone of like,
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:49.440]   why would I do it?
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.280]   That seems crazy.
[00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:51.840]   I trust, you know, like,
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:53.200]   so it's just so funny. - I get it.
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.960]   - I'm trying to have this rational conversation
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.200]   and those emotions, I still see them.
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.480]   - Oh, listen, I have,
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:03.840]   I'm gonna say 85% of people react to this soapbox
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:06.040]   that I have in that way.
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:09.320]   You know, even if they see from like a very rational side
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:10.840]   of things that it makes a lot of sense,
[00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:14.600]   a lot of people still feel, yeah, it's not romantic.
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:15.440]   I get it.
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:19.120]   There's nothing about that process that is romantic.
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:22.400]   But even if you're not gonna sign on the dotted line,
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:25.680]   to have the conversations that are required of you
[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:27.800]   when going through the prenup process,
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:31.160]   that is some of the best pre-marriage conversations
[00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.080]   that I could ever recommend somebody having.
[00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:35.000]   And even if you're not going to get married,
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.360]   but if you're in a long-term committed relationship,
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:41.080]   it is such helpful conversation to be having,
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:43.560]   'cause it really digs into not only how each of you
[00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:45.720]   react to money, let me tell you,
[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.240]   you'll be surprised what triggers you
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:48.480]   during the prenup process.
[00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:49.360]   You know, you might be like,
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:52.200]   wow, I did not expect to react that way to something,
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.360]   but you will.
[00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:56.600]   And it also gets into how each of you
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:57.680]   personally feels about money,
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.360]   how you wanna handle money in a marriage,
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:00.680]   what feels fair to you.
[00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:03.120]   And then, yeah, if certain things come up,
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.560]   what feels fair to you at that time?
[00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:08.520]   And again, that's gonna be an evolving conversation.
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.560]   What felt fair six years ago
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.120]   when my husband and I were working on this
[00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.600]   probably feels a little different than right now
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:17.320]   at this phase in our relationship and marriage.
[00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.600]   - Yeah, and I think the last thing I'll say on this
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:22.640]   is that if you had asked me a month ago,
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:26.000]   so I just, I binged part of Ramit's show,
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.600]   and I've listened to his podcast,
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:30.600]   it still amazes me,
[00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.200]   just given the way that my wife and I manage our finances,
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.760]   that there are couples where you can get married
[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:39.080]   and find out later that one spouse has a lot of debt
[00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:40.440]   and the other one doesn't.
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:44.120]   It seems crazy that you could sign a contract
[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.880]   that would require you to be equally liable
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:49.680]   for a financial situation in some ways
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:53.120]   without actually understanding that situation
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.480]   before going in.
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.080]   I know you have a few things to say here,
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:58.480]   so I'm just gonna leave that as an open door
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:02.640]   when it comes to if either spouse has student loans
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:04.560]   or credit card debt or anything like that,
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:07.800]   does that play into this situation and change anything?
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.360]   - It should.
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:12.480]   If your spouse has debt, first of all,
[00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:14.760]   again, know the rules of your state.
[00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:16.600]   Is there any possibility for you
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:19.620]   to become legally obligated to that debt
[00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:21.760]   as a byproduct of getting married?
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.960]   Oftentimes the answer is no,
[00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:26.960]   unless you accumulated it together in the marriage
[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:30.960]   or they accumulated it unbeknownst to you in the marriage,
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:32.360]   it still could impact you,
[00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:34.200]   so that's an important thing to know.
[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:37.880]   But student loans obviously being a big thing for millennials
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:40.600]   outside of you co-signing on it,
[00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:44.760]   typically you are not legally connected to that debt
[00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:46.200]   in the case of a divorce.
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:50.120]   Now, what happens if you get married
[00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:53.640]   and you graciously, aggressively help your spouse
[00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:55.880]   pay off the student loans
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:57.760]   and then your marriage goes down the tubes
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:59.800]   a year or two later?
[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:01.640]   I've seen this on Reddit a few times.
[00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:03.360]   (laughs)
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:06.760]   And all of a sudden, you had paid tens of thousands of
[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:08.720]   dollars to help your spouse get out of debt
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:11.440]   and they're like, "Okay, I'm out."
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.620]   A prenup actually could solve for that problem.
[00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:16.100]   You could, there's all sorts of different strategies
[00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:17.040]   that you could put in,
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:19.720]   but you could have kind of like a vesting period
[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:21.960]   for what they would owe you back
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:24.920]   if you came in and paid off a huge amount of their debt
[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:26.320]   and then the marriage dissolved
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:28.320]   in a certain period of time.
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:31.360]   Again, is that a romantic thing to be talking about
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:32.680]   when you're planning your wedding?
[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:34.440]   Absolutely not.
[00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:36.980]   Does it sometimes sound like you don't trust your partner?
[00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:41.120]   It might, but that is an important conversation to be having
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:44.520]   'cause again, you just don't know what could happen.
[00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:46.720]   And particularly if you have worked very hard
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:50.200]   to set up a solid financial life for yourself,
[00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:52.120]   you don't want something like a divorce
[00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:54.520]   to completely undo all of that work.
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:56.040]   But it sounds like even if you're four or five years
[00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:57.020]   into a marriage and you're like,
[00:13:57.020 --> 00:14:00.340]   "Let's use our savings to pay off your student loans,"
[00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:01.520]   that could be a time where you say,
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:03.840]   "Well, could we set up a very specific post-up
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:05.240]   for this situation?"
[00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:07.640]   And that, the thing that I never really considered is like,
[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:10.640]   it doesn't necessarily have to change
[00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:13.300]   some of the default state rules, right?
[00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:15.920]   You can get a post-up, I assume, that says,
[00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:18.080]   "Hey, you're gonna have to pay back the student loans."
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:20.280]   But we still split all of our assets.
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:23.440]   You don't have to rewrite everything
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:26.900]   and kind of do it in a way that's like protecting your money
[00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:28.520]   and make sure no one ever gets it.
[00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:30.560]   It doesn't have to have all those stipulations.
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:34.280]   And it doesn't need to be adversarial truly at any point.
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:37.380]   That is the one beauty I see of doing it
[00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:39.760]   at what hopefully is sort of like a peak time
[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:41.600]   of your love bubble when you're engaged
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.040]   and you're getting excited to be married
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.740]   and start this life together,
[00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:47.320]   that you will be kind and fair and generous with each other
[00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:49.820]   'cause there's a reason you're marrying this person.
[00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:53.200]   And also depending on work situations,
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.760]   that person might've helped you
[00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:56.880]   get where you are financially.
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:00.340]   Like I know a lot of my career is owed to my husband
[00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:02.640]   handling a lot of things behind the scenes
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:06.120]   and being supportive and doing a lot for my household too.
[00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:08.800]   So yeah, he deserves some of the money.
