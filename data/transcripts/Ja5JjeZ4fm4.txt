[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.840]   - Today begins our 12th National Conference,
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.280]   and today we're here at the Minneapolis Convention Center.
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.400]   It's also our final National Conference,
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.020]   so it's pretty bittersweet.
[00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:15.100]   We've had a great response,
[00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.960]   and every hotel in downtown Minneapolis is filled up,
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.560]   so it should be a really wonderful weekend together.
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:21.440]   The conference is titled,
[00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.480]   "Look at the Book, Reading the Bible for Yourself."
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.980]   The fun begins this afternoon
[00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.700]   with seminars from Jerry Bridges, Nancy Guthrie,
[00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.200]   Ben Stewart, John Bloom, Jason Meyer, and others.
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.200]   And this evening, Pastor John,
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.000]   you will deliver a message titled,
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.360]   "Scripture, the Kindling of Christian Hedonism."
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.200]   And for those of you who are listening
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.420]   who can't make it to Minneapolis,
[00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.720]   the conference will be live-streamed as well.
[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.400]   Speaking of reading the Bible for ourselves,
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.000]   we have a question from a frustrated podcast listener
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.800]   who asks, "Pastor John, I've read the Bible,
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.140]   "and a lot of it just doesn't make sense to me.
[00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.520]   "Why should I keep reading if I don't feel
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.560]   "like I know enough to understand it?"
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.660]   What would you say, Pastor John?
[00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:59.940]   - Well, I don't want this person
[00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.060]   to go on reading without understanding, so I resonate.
[00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.900]   I love poetry, and I buy volumes of poetry,
[00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.380]   and I go online and read poets.
[00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.140]   But if I pick up a new author that I've not read before,
[00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.860]   and I've done this maybe three times
[00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.380]   in the last six months, and I try about 10 poems,
[00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.220]   and none of them makes any sense to me at all,
[00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.860]   I'm gonna lay the book down.
[00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:24.980]   I am, I get it.
[00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.300]   I get this.
[00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.160]   I'm not gonna keep reading the book.
[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.460]   You know, for poem after poem after poem,
[00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.740]   that is meaningless to me.
[00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.980]   But something else might happen, right?
[00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.020]   Someone who knows this author way better than I do
[00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.420]   might come along and say, "Oh, you read those 10?
[00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.640]   "Mm, don't start there.
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.200]   "Those are the most obscure,
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.460]   "the most difficult poems he ever wrote."
[00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.700]   There's a whole world of poems that he has written
[00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.460]   that are clear and really interesting and really helpful.
[00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.700]   Here, start here, and maybe you'll even catch on
[00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.940]   to the way he uses language,
[00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.340]   and maybe someday those poems will make sense.
[00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.780]   In other words, someone might rescue me
[00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.900]   from throwing away a great poet
[00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.380]   because I stepped into the deep end of the pool
[00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.580]   and went over my head right away.
[00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.060]   So what I'd like to do is help this person
[00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.700]   get over the hump of feeling like the Bible
[00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.740]   is over their head or from another planet
[00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.420]   or just totally irrelevant.
[00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.460]   And the real answer to the question
[00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:43.040]   of why press on is it's worth it.
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.660]   The Bible has so much to give,
[00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.660]   and what it has to give only can be found in the Bible.
[00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.680]   If you turn away from it, it can't be found anywhere else,
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.060]   and nothing can compare to it.
[00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.420]   So that Psalm 19 really is true.
[00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.260]   "More to be desired are they than gold,
[00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.360]   "even much fine gold,
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.080]   "sweeter also than honey
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.360]   "and drippings from the honeycomb.
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.020]   "Moreover, by them is your servant warned,
[00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.580]   "and in keeping them there is great reward."
[00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.460]   That's what I want for everybody who looks at the Bible
[00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.860]   and finds it to be too hard or confusing or irrelevant.
[00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:28.900]   That's not true.
[00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.700]   It is better than gold, better than silver,
[00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.740]   better than honey, great reward.
[00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:37.340]   And so I want people to hang in there
[00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.480]   because in the Bible, we find truth
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.040]   that will save us eternally.
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.060]   First Timothy 4:16,
[00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:49.060]   we find truth that liberates us from sin and satan
[00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.060]   we find truth that gives peace with God.
[00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.500]   We find truth that empowers holiness and love,
[00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.700]   truth that sustains in the hardest times.
[00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.940]   It really is the greatest book in the world
[00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.460]   because it's the only book inspired by God Almighty,
[00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.340]   the creator of the universe,
[00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.540]   and the only one that can make us wise
[00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.740]   unto everlasting life.
[00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.100]   So here's my encouragement.
[00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.020]   I want to give six simple steps
[00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:23.340]   for this discouraged Bible reader to try.
[00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.460]   Number one, make sure you have a modern translation
[00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.460]   that's readable, like the ESV or the NIV.
[00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.220]   Number two, make sure you are in a church
[00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.440]   where the pastor explains passages
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.300]   from the Bible every Sunday.
[00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.120]   That's what preaching is, it should be.
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.820]   If you're not in a church where the Bible is explained,
[00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.980]   probably need another church.
[00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.420]   And where you can be in a small group
[00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.260]   where folks talk about these things
[00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.820]   and you can ask all your questions about the Bible.
[00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.820]   Number three, get a good study Bible,
[00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.580]   like the ESV study Bible.
[00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:58.840]   'Cause in a study Bible,
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.220]   there are these notes at the bottom of the page
[00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.500]   that answer a lot of your puzzling questions
[00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.460]   and give guidance for newcomers
[00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.460]   who aren't making sense out of it right away.
[00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.060]   Number four, read carefully and slowly,
[00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.900]   trying even maybe to write the passage.
[00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.540]   And I don't mean write out the long stories
[00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:18.380]   in the Old Testament.
[00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:21.340]   I mean, if you're stumbling over verses or a paragraph
[00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.420]   in the letters or in the gospels, try writing it down.
[00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:29.060]   Number five, a little self-advertisement here.
[00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.700]   Join us online at Look at the Book,
[00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.060]   episodes that are gonna go public
[00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.100]   at our national conference and be online
[00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.780]   at least by October 1, I'm not sure exact date.
[00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:44.020]   And there'll be there for me to help guide you
[00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.140]   through texts that I hope will instill habits
[00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:50.300]   of reading in you that will make the Bible live
[00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:51.840]   and make it understandable for you.
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.540]   And the last thing would be pray.
[00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.620]   Pray for God to give you light.
[00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:00.140]   God loves to make his son known.
[00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:03.580]   He sent him into the world at the cost of his life
[00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.900]   so that he could be known and loved.
[00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:09.780]   He's not interested in holding back from you
[00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:13.500]   the light that he gave with his son and gave with his word.
[00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.220]   Amen.
[00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:16.040]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.460]   And watch for more information about those
[00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.020]   Look at the Book video lessons by following us online
[00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.180]   at desiringgod.org/blog.
[00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:24.900]   And if you're on your way to Minneapolis,
[00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.940]   we look forward to seeing you at the conference later today.
[00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:29.040]   If you can't make it, the conference will be live-streamed
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.020]   at desiringgod.org/live.
[00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:33.540]   Be sure to check out the schedule there
[00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:35.660]   to follow the conference remotely.
[00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.420]   Well, we have parenting questions like crazy
[00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.020]   piling up in our email inbox,
[00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:41.780]   and if everything works just right,
[00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:44.800]   we will welcome to the podcast a guest next week.
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.080]   The guest will be Ted Tripp.
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.780]   To answer some of your most perplexing parenting questions,
[00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:51.860]   Tripp is the author of "Shepherding a Child's Heart"
[00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:54.100]   and "Instructing a Child's Heart."
[00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:55.540]   Two wonderful books.
[00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.140]   In either case, we'll be back on Monday.
[00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:58.580]   Until then, I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:59.840]   Enjoy the conference.
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.420]   (upbeat music)
[00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:05.000]   (upbeat music)
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
