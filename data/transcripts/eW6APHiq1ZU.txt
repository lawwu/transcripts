[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.760]   You can tell when Buffett has gotten disengaged with a company based on the number of times he
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.400]   mentions it in his annual letter. I think this Buffett index is a really important one for Apple,
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.720]   which is it went from a forever holding to barely getting mentioned. Unfortunately,
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.960]   it speaks for a very bad next five to 10 years for this company unless they figure something out.
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.280]   If you do not start seeing revenue flow to the bottom line of these companies that are spending
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.240]   $26 billion a quarter, the market cap of Nvidia is not what the market cap of Nvidia should be.
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.240]   And all of these other companies are going to get punished for spending this kind of money.
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.000]   It doesn't all hang together yet. I think the bigger question, though,
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.160]   is if we are on the verge of a real contraction in the economy, even though the stock market for
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.360]   seven companies is hitting all time highs, the stock market for every other company that isn't
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.920]   those seven companies have not. People aren't employed. There is no money. And the question
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.480]   is whether you have some sort of contraction economically that is measured by a recession or not.
