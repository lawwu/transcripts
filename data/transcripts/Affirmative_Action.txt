[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920]   Hello, everybody. It's Sam from the Financial Samurai podcast.
[00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.320]   And in this episode, I want to talk about affirmative action,
[00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:12.360]   because on Thursday, June 29th, 2023, the Supreme Court
[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.040]   invalidated race conscious admissions policies used by Harvard College
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.000]   and the University of North Carolina to diversify their campuses.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.040]   And this decision has enormous consequences
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.440]   not only for higher education, but also for the American workplace,
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.680]   which is the ultimate goal to try to get a good job, to get good pay,
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.320]   to take care of yourself, your friends and your family.
[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.840]   In a six to three decision written by Chief Justice John Roberts,
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.680]   the court held that the policies violated
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.280]   the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.720]   And what's the 14th Amendment?
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.480]   Well, on July 9th, 1868, the 14th Amendment
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.440]   granted citizenship to all persons, quote, born or naturalized
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.400]   in the United States, including formerly enslaved people,
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.360]   and provided all citizens with, quote, equal protection under the laws.
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.040]   The 14th Amendment was adopted after the Civil War.
[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.040]   The amendment was intended to protect the rights of former slaves
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.200]   who were subjected to discriminatory state laws, particularly in the South.
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.400]   During a lengthy oral argument in October 2022,
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.040]   the conservative justices focused on two points.
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.800]   The first point was 2003 precedence,
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.320]   included what some interpreted as an expiration date
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.920]   on the use of race conscious admissions, a line in the majority opinion
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.640]   that signaled a hope that such policies would no longer be needed by 2028.
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.040]   At the time, Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said,
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.360]   We expect that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.680]   will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today.
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.840]   That line suggested the court's acceptance of race
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.600]   conscious admissions wouldn't last forever.
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.320]   And the other point of contention was just how seriously universities
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.480]   are taking the 2003 opinions directive to try race neutral policies.
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.480]   First, the court said that the law requires schools to engage in a, quote,
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.480]   serious good faith consideration of workable race neutral alternatives
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.760]   that will achieve the diversity the university seeks.
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.200]   Before the Supreme Court ruling, nine states, including Washington,
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.120]   Michigan and California, already banned the consideration of race in higher education.
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.160]   So the decision is final now.
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.880]   But what does this mean after affirmative action has been banned?
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.000]   Well, I'm not sure too much will change because I think colleges
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.760]   will just simply do a workaround, private colleges, at least,
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.600]   who want to mold and escape their incoming class how they see fit.
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.320]   I think colleges will just say, well, here's a supplemental
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.640]   essay question that asks about your background.
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.440]   Tell us about who you are, where you come from.
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.600]   What about your heritage, your culture, your ethnicity, your race, your anything?
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.600]   And I think that's the simplest workaround you can have
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.240]   unless the Supreme Court then specifically says you cannot ask in any essay
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.120]   about anything about a background, applicant's background.
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:31.200]   I just don't think it really is going to change the dynamics of private colleges
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.840]   and how they select their incoming class.
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.920]   I also think there's going to be continued momentum going forward
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:44.400]   regarding making SAT and ACT optional or completely application blind.
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.280]   So where colleges don't accept these scores at all.
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:53.440]   And this is another way for colleges to select students based on a more holistic
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.560]   view instead of a more objective view in terms of the test scores.
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.480]   There's still going to be grades involved.
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:06.120]   But as any administrator knows, grades in schools are hard to compare.
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:12.480]   There's different GPA scales, different rigors, but grades will still be involved.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.440]   So for the remainder of this podcast, let's talk about the pros and cons of
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.080]   affirmative action, and I want to share my views as an Asian-American about
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.880]   affirmative action, because I am debating on whether to pay private grade school
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.000]   tuition for 13 years for each of my two children.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.200]   Can you imagine paying $500,000 for 13 years of private grade school tuition
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.240]   only for your child to go to Penn State instead of UPenn?
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.160]   And now no offense to Penn State graduates out there and students, it's
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.680]   a fine, fine university, go Nittany Lions.
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.240]   This was just a headline I read on my Bloomberg terminal back in the 2000s,
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:57.560]   and it has stuck with me ever since, given I think about financial returns all the time.
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:03.320]   As a public high school and public college graduate, my preference is for
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:09.800]   public schools because things have worked out fine for me, but I am only one example.
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.000]   Public schools are where kids interact with a wider range of
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.880]   socioeconomic backgrounds.
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.400]   I think that's a really good thing because the real world is diverse.
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:25.280]   There are also more student conflicts and fights in public schools, which
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.760]   may help toughen a kid up.
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.880]   The most violence I have ever experienced in my life all came
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.800]   from my time at public schools.
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.200]   So if you don't like violence, well, maybe public schools might
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.760]   not be the right path for you.
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.760]   But if you're okay with the occasional conflict, so long as your
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:45.960]   child doesn't get seriously hurt, well, maybe public schools will be fine
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.280]   because if you can survive that type of conflict and violence, I think it
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:51.480]   will toughen you up in the future.
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.920]   Or it could crush your soul.
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.880]   So you've got to figure out what's the best for your child.
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.680]   So first of all, let's talk about the arguments for affirmative
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.120]   action in college admissions.
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.520]   One, promoting diversity.
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.600]   Two, addressing historical disadvantages.
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.040]   Three, ensuring equal opportunity.
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:15.680]   Four, enhancing educational benefits.
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.920]   Five, promoting social mobility.
[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:23.520]   Six, meeting legal and moral obligations.
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:24.960]   Those are the positives.
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:29.280]   Now, arguments against affirmative action in college admissions include
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.800]   one, reverse discrimination.
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:35.080]   Two, undermining meritocracy.
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.920]   Three, stereotype threat.
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:43.040]   Four, it disadvantages non-underrepresented groups.
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:47.360]   Five, lack of individual assessment.
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.560]   Six, there could be unintended consequences.
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:56.760]   Seven, there could be perpetuating division of races.
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:01.160]   The more we talk about race, it seems like the more we divide races.
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.840]   So what are my thoughts on affirmative action when I was a student?
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:10.920]   As someone who came to America as a high school freshman in 1991, I felt I had no
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.560]   say about affirmative action whatsoever.
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:18.760]   I had not suffered or benefited from my race given I grew up in Zambia, the
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:23.800]   Philippines, Japan, Taiwan, and Malaysia because my parents worked at the US
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.160]   Foreign Service.
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:29.360]   I understood my parents were middle class given they worked for the US State
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:29.680]   Department.
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:33.800]   We lived in a modest townhouse and drove an eight-year-old Toyota Camry.
[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:38.960]   Camry was actually an upgrade from the paintless 1976 Datsun we drove in
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.280]   Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:44.320]   I mainly wanted to go to a public university because it was cheaper.
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:50.800]   I felt it was absurd to spend over $20,000 a year on private tuition at the
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.760]   time when we could spend just $2,800 a year.
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:59.360]   It didn't make sense to me how private school could be seven, eight, nine times
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.640]   more expensive.
[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:05.480]   I remember I was working at McDonald's, the local McDonald's in McLean, Virginia
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:06.760]   for $4 an hour.
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:09.520]   Then I got a raise to $4.25 an hour.
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:15.840]   I was on my feet for five, six hours a day flipping those burgers and grilling
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:16.720]   those sausages.
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:17.760]   It was no fun.
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:24.320]   I was thinking to myself, "Man, worst case scenario, if I went to college, I went to
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.920]   the college of William & Mary and I couldn't get a job, I would just always go
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:32.840]   back to McDonald's for hopefully $4.50 an hour at that time or maybe $5 an hour at
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:37.520]   that time and then pay back my parents the $2,800 a year in tuition."
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:43.640]   Virginia had the University of Virginia, William & Mary, Mary Washington, James
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:46.000]   Madison, George Mason and Virginia Tech at the time.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.720]   So based on the college rankings, these were great schools, good enough schools
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:53.200]   for me to attend, especially for the cost.
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:59.240]   And I knew in high school, I knew I was neither gifted academically nor
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:04.600]   athletically to get into a top 20 private college, private university with
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:05.400]   scholarships.
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.360]   So I didn't even bother applying.
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:12.320]   Private college tuition was just simply too much to bear for our household and I
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.560]   wanted to pay my own way eventually.
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:20.000]   And it was when I got to the United States that I start learning more about
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.880]   slavery and other historical injustices against blacks and other minorities in
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:25.360]   America.
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:30.360]   So obviously I became a proponent of affirmative action because who wouldn't
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:33.040]   want to right the wrongs of the past?
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:36.160]   If we have the opportunity to help, we must help.
[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:41.360]   Even though I was waitlisted from a couple of colleges, I never felt like race
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:42.440]   was a deciding factor.
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:49.760]   I felt like my mediocre SAT score and my 3.68 GPA simply weren't good enough to
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:50.160]   get in.
[00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:55.720]   My essays probably didn't sound very natural either since I used a lot of SAT
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:56.800]   vocabulary words.
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.560]   Oh, the irony.
[00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:01.760]   I remember my sister saying, "You sound like a robot."
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:06.600]   But I didn't really change because I thought that's what college admissions
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.000]   officers wanted to hear.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.840]   They wanted to hear kids who could talk about starboard or portside for their yacht
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:15.200]   that they don't own, you know?
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:19.200]   Funny, funny words that I had no idea about, but I just looked it up in the
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:22.680]   dictionary and said, "Okay, this is what they want.
[00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:23.800]   So this is what they're going to get."
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:29.520]   And I never felt some undeserving kid got into a better school than me due to their
[00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:29.920]   race.
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:33.920]   Instead, I was just thankful that I got into the College of William and Mary.
[00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:39.760]   William and Mary and UVA were my two target schools and they were considered two of
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:42.960]   the best schools in Virginia at that affordable price.
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.760]   And yes, I absolutely did experience racism in Virginia.
[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:55.000]   The KKK left flyers at my ex-girlfriend's home one day, maybe because they saw us
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.440]   eat at a greasy spoon diner one day in Abingdon, Virginia.
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:02.680]   And maybe they followed us back and they tried to threaten us.
[00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:07.000]   Yes, I've been called names during high school and college.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.240]   I've experienced all those things.
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:15.120]   But as I said in the beginning, it was due to these experiences that have toughened me
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:22.000]   up, that have made me, well, not wilt like a flower because of name calling, that have
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.920]   made me stand up more for myself to fight for myself and now for my family.
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:30.680]   And you know what happened after each racist experience?
[00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:36.840]   Well, it made me open my eyes even further and lit a fire in me to achieve financial
[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.280]   independence, ASAP.
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:44.280]   And that meant studying hard, networking, getting the best job I could, putting up
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:50.280]   with BS at work, continuing to grind and grind and grind so that one day I could be
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:51.720]   beholden to no one.
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:54.520]   So I appreciate those difficult experiences.
[00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:56.200]   So what now?
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:59.680]   What are my thoughts on affirmative action as a father of two children?
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:03.000]   Over 30 years have passed since I first applied to college.
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:08.240]   And I have been wondering how long affirmative action in college admissions would
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:14.480]   continue. And now I know on June 29th, 2023, that it's supposedly not going to
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:19.480]   continue anymore. I do believe society should still take action to right historical
[00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:24.120]   wrongs. The dilemma, the question is to what degree?
[00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:31.520]   When I see Asian-Americans with 1500 plus SAT scores and 4.0 plus GPAs regularly get
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:37.440]   rejected by top 20 private universities, I feel like there's no hope for my children to
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:39.440]   getting into any of those top universities.
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:45.240]   I don't want them to try really hard during grade school only to be told 13 years
[00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:47.960]   later they aren't good enough because of their identity.
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:51.360]   I think all of us would agree that would really stink.
[00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:57.480]   We also know that many private universities game the system by accepting wealthy,
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:00.200]   underrepresented minorities from outside the U.S.
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:03.160]   to help fulfill their diversity requirements.
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:08.560]   And that's not right since we're trying to help Americans who were screwed over in the
[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:11.040]   past, not people from other countries.
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:16.920]   So today, I feel that affirmative action based on wealth and whether one has a
[00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:19.280]   disability seems like a fair solution.
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:25.440]   If you are poor, you may not have the same family support and resources to do well in
[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:30.240]   school. I didn't grow up poor, but I still had to go to the library or Barnes and Noble
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:35.880]   and flip through those Princeton SAT preparation books that cost like $30 at the
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:38.080]   time. And I couldn't afford to buy those.
[00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:42.560]   I thought I was learning how to be a better test taker by skimming the questions and
[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:48.080]   answers. But in reality, I was fooling myself by just looking at the book and not
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:49.040]   really going deep.
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:54.240]   My rich classmates at McLean High School, on the other hand, had parents who sent them
[00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:57.640]   to $2,500 Princeton Review SAT courses.
[00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:00.200]   Of course, they ended up scoring better than me.
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:05.280]   Well, I don't know. Maybe that's an excuse, but I think there's a high correlation with
[00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:08.920]   paying for those Princeton Review classes and doing better on the SATs.
[00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:11.880]   Otherwise, those classes wouldn't be in business.
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:17.800]   How is a middle class or poor kid supposed to pay $2,500 to take those classes?
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:20.240]   No way. I had wealthy classmates.
[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:25.680]   One guy named Conrad, he went to Columbia and another woman named Maureen, she went to
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:27.440]   Dartmouth. They were rich.
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:28.960]   Their parents were rich.
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:31.400]   It was obvious. And they were able to get ahead.
[00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:38.560]   And like I said earlier, I knew we weren't rich, so I was happy, happy to go to a local
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:39.600]   state university.
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:44.640]   I also strongly, strongly believe we should fight for those with disabilities.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.920]   Roughly 15 percent of the world's population, one in five, has some sort of disability,
[00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:54.560]   minor or major that may make it more difficult to compete.
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:15:00.040]   For example, let's say you have a visual impairment where no matter whether you have
[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:06.840]   contacts or glasses, these things cannot correct your vision to 2020 like most other
[00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:11.920]   people. If this is the case, you may have a more difficult time seeing the chalkboard or
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:13.040]   the whiteboard in class.
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:19.120]   The questions on exam may also be harder to read because the font size is too small.
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:25.320]   As a result, you might zone off or just pretend you can see as a teenager just to fit in.
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:29.720]   At the very least, you may need more time on your exams.
[00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:36.040]   So hopefully the parents or you speak up for yourself in terms of what you need to equal
[00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:41.040]   the playing field. However, if you tend not to speak up or if you don't speak up at all,
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:45.760]   you may fall behind your peers who get to learn in full 2020 vision.
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:51.680]   If you were born with a disability that makes it more difficult or impossible to see, hear,
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:59.840]   move, process, socialize and understand, competing will likely be more difficult.
[00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:05.960]   So why not fight for those who were born with disabilities that make it more difficult for
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:08.360]   them to compete? I think it's a no brainer.
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:10.800]   I think it's a no brainer.
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:17.440]   Over 60 years after affirmative action was introduced, I'd prefer to see economically
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:24.480]   disadvantaged kids from all races and kids with disabilities from all races get more
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:25.600]   help instead.
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:29.440]   In a very big way, I am also an educator.
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:32.160]   Financial samurai should be for everyone.
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:36.760]   When I write my articles on financial samurai or I'm recording podcasts on the
[00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:42.240]   financial samurai podcast, I'm not thinking about race of the reader or the listener.
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:47.920]   I'm thinking about the financial questions or problems the readers and listeners have.
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:52.880]   I'm conscious about people with visual impairments, which is why I've increased the
[00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:55.600]   font size in my latest site redesign.
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:17:02.680]   And I'm recording more podcasts on here on Apple, on Spotify, Google Play to provide
[00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:09.040]   more accessibility, because I don't want anybody to feel left out or be left out from
[00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:13.280]   trying to gain financial freedom sooner rather than later.
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:15.400]   We're all on the set clock here, folks.
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:20.800]   All the content on financial samurai is free, including my weekly newsletter at
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:23.480]   financialsamurai.com/news.
[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:29.680]   And it's free because my main goal is to help educate folks about money.
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:36.240]   I've already got my quote endowment, which consists of our investments that generate
[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:37.480]   livable passive income.
[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:41.720]   So charging a fee to access my content doesn't feel right.
[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:44.360]   It's not my main goal to make money.
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:46.240]   Money will come on the side.
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:51.360]   But really, it's the stories that I hear from you through your emails and your
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:56.920]   comments that say so and so article or so and so podcast episode five or six or seven
[00:17:56.920 --> 00:18:01.240]   years ago helped make a difference because, man, since starting Financial Samurai in
[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:06.120]   2009, so many of our lives have changed and hopefully for the better.
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:09.320]   Right. We became fathers and mothers.
[00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:14.400]   We changed jobs and joined startups or joined big corporations.
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.920]   We got fired, but hopefully we got a severance.
[00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:22.040]   We were able to save and invest for the future and benefit from the bull market.
[00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:28.320]   Our parents passed away, but we were able to manage their estate in an orderly
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:31.680]   manner. Life continues to change and go on.
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:34.160]   And that's why I'm going to continue to write and record.
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:38.760]   I don't want anybody to be excluded from learning about personal finance if they want
[00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:45.640]   to. But maybe some universities do in order to maintain their air of exclusivity.
[00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:50.680]   What I think will be really interesting going forward is whether affirmative action for
[00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:55.720]   legacy students will go away, because if you look at the legacy student data admissions
[00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:58.240]   rates, they are way higher.
[00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:03.280]   We're talking five to eight X higher than the general pool.
[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:08.560]   So if you just happen to be born into a wealthy family where your parents went to these
[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:14.960]   prestigious schools, well, is it fair that you got a, let's say, 33 percent acceptance
[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:18.480]   rate chance versus the general pool of five point nine percent?
[00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:24.880]   If your parents are able to donate 50 million, 100 million dollars to a school wing, is
[00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:30.440]   it fair that you face a 42 percent acceptance rate if you're on the dean's interest
[00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:32.960]   list versus a six percent rate if you're not?
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:39.000]   Or if you're a child of faculty or staff, is it fair that you have a 46.7 percent
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.560]   chance of getting in versus only a six point six percent chance?
[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:44.920]   Maybe it's fair. Maybe it's not.
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:50.640]   But if we're trying to diversify the student body or if we're trying to be fair,
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:55.480]   well, I think legacy admissions probably has to change.
[00:19:55.480 --> 00:20:01.120]   In conclusion, let's agree that the ultimate goal of affirmative action is to provide
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:04.880]   upward mobility for historically disadvantaged people.
[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:10.840]   After generations of discrimination, the compounding effects can be extremely
[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:15.120]   detrimental. We all know the positive compounding effects of
[00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:20.920]   investing and we can see how that really builds over just 10 years, 20 years.
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:25.840]   But if we're talking about getting shut out from opportunities such as housing, jobs,
[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:31.680]   colleges for generations, well, of course, the playing field won't be level.
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:36.240]   And we should do things to help those who have been disadvantaged.
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:41.280]   Unfortunately, affirmative action in college admissions is often perceived as a zero
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:43.880]   sum game. And now it's gone.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:50.480]   So we've got to figure out different ways to move forward, whatever side you're on.
[00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:57.880]   I believe the best policy is to control what you can control, except that society is
[00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:02.640]   the way it is, except the Supreme Court rulings for whatever they may be.
[00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:08.800]   You can do things as a parent and as a student to help ensure that you're going to do
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:12.640]   better in life. Some of the things include spend as much time with your children as
[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:15.200]   possible to educate them about the ways of the world.
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:20.880]   Have a harmonious relationship with your significant other to provide more love and
[00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:25.480]   support at home. Maintain or start a lifestyle business until your kids graduate
[00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:30.120]   college to teach them business and provide career insurance just in case they can't get
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:33.160]   a job. You might want to write multiple books.
[00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:35.040]   Doesn't have to be a traditionally published book.
[00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:39.880]   It can be e-books to set an academic example about the importance of reading and
[00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:42.280]   writing while your kids are in school.
[00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:47.720]   You can teach them a second language to provide them with more opportunities if the
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:49.640]   English world shuts them out.
[00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:54.880]   You can invest and maintain a rental property portfolio so that they have housing
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:56.960]   security just in case.
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:03.240]   You can take out term life insurance policies so that they will be fine if you were to
[00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:04.320]   die prematurely.
[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:10.120]   You can teach them communication skills to help them build a better personality and
[00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:12.760]   better ways to connect with other people.
[00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:18.480]   You can encourage them to try harder and build grit because effort is what they can
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:24.280]   control. And finally, you can teach kids to love who they are to help build their
[00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:26.680]   confidence and self-esteem.
[00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:31.400]   I think spending more time educating our own children is the biggest win.
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:36.120]   We shouldn't outsource all our children's education to schools.
[00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:37.640]   It doesn't make sense.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.080]   I think if we can spend more time on the weekends and the mornings and the evenings
[00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:47.960]   talking about practical education, practical knowledge, I think that's going to go a
[00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:49.760]   long way to helping them succeed.
[00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:54.720]   Where you go to college matters, but whether you go to an accredited four-year
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:57.280]   college or not matters way more.
[00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:01.760]   Either go to a trade school or go to a reputable college that is affordable.
[00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:05.440]   The more affordable education you can get, generally the better.
[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:10.960]   The thing is, most of us aren't attending one of the top 25 private colleges in the
[00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:15.600]   nation. Therefore, affirmative action probably has little to no effect on the
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:20.760]   majority. Schools like Harvard and UNC Chapel Hill, these are elite schools.
[00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:25.480]   And just be frank, most of us can't get into these elite schools.
[00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:30.040]   I know I couldn't, but I still turned out OK because I was able to go to college and
[00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:33.400]   apply my knowledge and learn and build practical skills.
[00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:39.800]   All right, everyone, I hope I provided a balanced view on a very contentious topic.
[00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:44.200]   I know it's not easy, but I hope we can all have an open mind and move forward and
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:49.200]   take action to better our lives and the lives of people around us who we care about.
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:52.680]   If you enjoyed this episode, I'd love a positive review.
