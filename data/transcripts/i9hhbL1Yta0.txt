[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920]   team of scientists in Italy collected samples from patients
[00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.340]   that had plaque removed from the carotid artery. So a total of
[00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.260]   304 patients agreed to have the plaque that was removed from
[00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.800]   their artery submitted for analysis. And then what this
[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.300]   team did is they took that plaque and they studied it to
[00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:20.340]   see how much plastic was found in that plaque microplastics or
[00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.780]   nanoplastics remember are less than five millimeters in size
[00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:27.720]   with a mean level of 21 micrograms per milligram of
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.340]   plaque roughly one per 50 is the ratio of plastic to plaque
[00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.380]   that they found which is really incredible, incredible good or
[00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.700]   incredible bad, incredible bad that these microplastics are
[00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.640]   accumulating in the human body. Now here's the scary part. They
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.820]   then did a follow up 34 months later, the patients that had
[00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.860]   plastic in their blood had a four and a half times higher
[00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.580]   ratio or likelihood of having a heart attack, stroke or death
[00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.540]   from any cause. So all of these major health effects were four
[00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.020]   and a half times elevated in patients that had plastic in their blood.
