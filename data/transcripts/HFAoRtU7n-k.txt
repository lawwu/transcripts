[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   [Music]
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.500]   Peter, a podcast listener from Hong Kong, writes in to ask this.
[00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.100]   Dear Pastor John, Thank you for the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.340]   Your thoughtful answers provide a great help to me.
[00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.380]   My brother, who is a non-believer, says we Christians change the Old Testament commands
[00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.600]   to suit our needs.
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:29.360]   For example, he reiterates that God forbids Israelites to eat pork, while Jesus allows
[00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.600]   Christians to eat pork.
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.600]   Can you offer some pointers on perhaps how we can explain why it is okay for Christians
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.820]   to now eat pork, while God forbid it from the Israelites?
[00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.360]   And how do I explain this change with the Old Testament commands more generally to my
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.160]   non-Christian brother?
[00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:57.520]   It sounds to me like Peter's brother, who's not a believer, hasn't had any serious Christian
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:04.800]   teaching about the basic flow of redemptive history.
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.840]   In other words, how does the Bible work?
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:22.320]   What is God up to in creation, fall, prophecy, fulfillment, redemption, more promise, consummation?
[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.720]   In other words, God, God, there's a history that's flowing from creation to consummation,
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.440]   and there are phases in the history that are designed and built in.
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:43.800]   So it's not arbitrary when we Christians view certain aspects of the Old Testament as not
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:50.400]   binding anymore, because those aspects themselves gave evidence that they were pointing to something
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.740]   that would one day abrogate themselves.
[00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:06.200]   So if the brother of Peter says that we are just making it up as we go along, it might
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.720]   be good for Peter to offer to do a Bible study with him.
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:16.800]   I don't know, maybe he's done that already, but a Bible study, or read a book together,
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.200]   if he's a very thoughtful person, you might take up Tom Shriner's biblical theology, like
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:29.200]   The King and His Beauty, which is a big, weighty sweep of the whole Bible that would help answer
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.200]   some of the things.
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.800]   And if he doesn't want to tackle something that heavy, there are simpler books that give
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.720]   the sweep of the whole Bible.
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:44.480]   Or less intimidating, perhaps, would be simply take a cluster of passages of Scripture, and
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:51.320]   I'll give some here, and study them with him so that he can see, "Oh, you Christians, you
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.120]   aren't bringing this to the Bible.
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.920]   This is coming out of the Bible."
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.880]   So here's the fundamental thing that needs to be grasped.
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:09.780]   When Jesus Christ came into the world, he was the fulfillment of the entire Old Testament.
[00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:17.160]   The Old Testament had looked forward and pointed to the coming Messiah who would bring his
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:24.440]   kingdom, his new kingly rule, and when he did, they knew things would change.
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.600]   There was a new covenant promised where things would be written on the heart, the old covenant
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:35.200]   would pass away, and that was already there in the prophetic writings of the Old Testament.
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:42.760]   And now Jesus, that Messiah, has come, and everything has changed, and he himself gave
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.340]   the pointers to how they changed.
[00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:54.860]   So the key statement that he made is in Matthew 5:17, "Do not think I have come to abolish
[00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.660]   the law or the prophets.
[00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.700]   I have not come to abolish them, but to fulfill them."
[00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:11.220]   In other words, all the precious history and forms and structures and offices in the Old
[00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:20.640]   Testament aren't merely thrown away, they are consummated, they are filled up in Jesus.
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.100]   And then you start getting examples.
[00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.620]   So here's some examples.
[00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:29.100]   Jesus said, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up."
[00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:36.140]   And he meant his body, and John talks about Jesus as the place where we will worship.
[00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:39.660]   So Jesus is the new temple.
[00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.520]   He's the new place where people meet God.
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:50.100]   Or 1 Corinthians 5:7, "Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed."
[00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:56.620]   So now he's the Passover, so that whole celebration, and all the sacrifices go with him.
[00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.940]   Hebrews 5:1, "For every high priest chosen among men is appointed to act on behalf of
[00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:08.460]   men in relation to God, to offer gifts and sacrifices, but we have a great high priest."
[00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:14.980]   So Jesus is now the high priest, and he takes the place of the entire priesthood of the
[00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.260]   Old Testament.
[00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:23.700]   Galatians 3:24, "The law was our guardian until the Messiah came, until Christ came,
[00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.560]   in order that we might be justified by faith."
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:35.600]   So it sounds like Peter's brother is not aware of the built-in progress of redemptive
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:43.860]   history from promise to fulfillment, with Christ himself being the main fulfillment.
[00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.420]   But then there's this as well, and this helps to explain some things.
[00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:56.580]   The new people that Jesus is gathering as his church, this people is no longer defined
[00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:05.860]   by political and ethnic unity, but rather as a people from all nations, all ethnicities,
[00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:12.140]   scattered among all political states, and not identified with any one of them, and unified
[00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.780]   in their connection with Jesus.
[00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:23.180]   Therefore, the laws which dealt with Israel as a state are no longer applied that way,
[00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:26.740]   since the people of God are no longer a political entity.
[00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:33.140]   They aren't a state, but are aliens and sojourners and exiles on the earth.
[00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:38.980]   So for example, the church excommunicates people at the very point where in the Old
[00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:42.660]   Testament they would have been executed, like for adultery.
[00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:49.940]   And so you can see already profound changes have happened in the kinds of structures and
[00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:53.220]   the kinds of guidelines for behavior.
[00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:59.360]   Now that means, for example, and this is the one that Peter asked about, the food laws,
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:07.180]   that the food laws which were created to set Israel off from the nations and symbolize
[00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:11.620]   her purity for God are no longer used that way.
[00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:16.780]   And we see Jesus undoing that in Mark 7, 18.
[00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:24.100]   Do you not see that whatever goes into a person from outside cannot defile him, since it enters
[00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:28.860]   not his heart, but his stomach, and is expelled?
[00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:35.460]   And then Mark adds, "Thus he declared all foods clean."
[00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:36.780]   And then he continues.
[00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:40.380]   He said, "What comes out of a person is what defiles him."
[00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:46.340]   So the reason—here's what Peter can say to his brother—the reason we eat catfish
[00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:56.740]   and pork is because Mark, the inspired spokesman interpreting Jesus' words in Mark 7, 19,
[00:07:56.740 --> 00:08:01.580]   said, "Thus he declared all foods clean."
[00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:09.860]   Meaning those laws which once defined Israel as a people of ethnic, religious, and political
[00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:14.440]   distinction from the world don't function that way anymore.
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:20.060]   So Jesus brought a new covenant into being, which is already promised there in Jeremiah
[00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:27.380]   31, and Hebrews, which is a key book on this topic, said, "In speaking of a new covenant,
[00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:31.180]   he makes the first one obsolete."
[00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:36.060]   And what is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to vanish away.
[00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:41.220]   And Paul put it like this in Romans 7, "My brothers, you have died to the law through
[00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:46.820]   the body of Christ, so that you may belong to another, to him who has been raised from
[00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:50.260]   the dead, in order that we might bear fruit for God."
[00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:54.820]   So we do bear fruit for God, but we don't key off of the law, we key off of Jesus.
[00:08:54.820 --> 00:09:02.020]   Verse 6, "But now we are released from the law, having died to that which held us captive,
[00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:08.060]   so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit," and not the old written code.
[00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:16.620]   So the most basic thing for Peter's brother to see, I think, is that Christ has come and
[00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:24.300]   died and risen, and now we belong to him, not to the law as a way of salvation.
[00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:26.940]   He is our righteousness before God.
[00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:33.700]   He dictates in his person, in his example, in his word, what our lives should look like
[00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:35.020]   in this world.
[00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:36.100]   Wonderful.
[00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:40.780]   This food question is really a sweet invitation to talk about Jesus Christ.
[00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:44.140]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you, Peter, for the question.
[00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:45.740]   Peter, arise and eat.
[00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:51.020]   If you want to send in a question to us, and really, if you want to find anything related
