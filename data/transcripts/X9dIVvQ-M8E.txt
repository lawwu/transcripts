[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.920]   We close the week with an email today from a longtime listener named Pete Spradley. Pete writes in to ask this
[00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:12.440]   Quote I have now listened to every John Piper sermon on desiring God org
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.760]   That is that's quite an achievement Pete and I don't think I have heard my question answered
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:25.200]   Pastor John will we continue to fear God and tremble before him in our perfect glorified state in heaven?
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:31.800]   What would you say pastor John? Well, I don't I don't know if he's heard the answer to that either because I can't remember
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:39.460]   Whether I ever talked about it, maybe not. It's a good question. I think to answer
[00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.000]   The question carefully we have to ask what trembling
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.240]   actually is
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:52.720]   The first thing it is is the movement of the body
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.480]   so the muscles are quivering and
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:02.520]   Today in our scientific age we would say the nerves are
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.600]   Active in an increased way owing to some kind of chemical stimulus
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.520]   so
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.520]   in and of itself
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.480]   Trembling is morally
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.680]   Neutral it's neither a virtue nor a vice
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.400]   the motion of
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.440]   irrational inanimate matter
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.520]   like muscle
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.120]   Cannot be described as virtuous or morally evil
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.840]   but
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:39.120]   Trembling takes on moral dimensions when it is the the overflow of certain
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.040]   spiritual emotions or
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:48.000]   Affections that are either good or evil so we may be trembling
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.600]   Because we are about to be caught red-handed doing something evil
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.320]   or
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.760]   we may be trembling because we can hardly contain ourselves with excitement that
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:10.640]   The husband who has been away at war for two years is about to walk off that plane into the wife's arms
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:17.080]   In other words trembling may be the bodily overflow of something
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.280]   sinful or something good and my guess is that the
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:30.440]   participation of the body by trembling in something very good and very hopeful does not
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.040]   diminish the joy of
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.520]   The experience but intensifies it
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.040]   That may not always be the case, but seems to me sometimes
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.520]   Surely, that's the case all of that to say that trembling
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:52.760]   In and of itself is not something we might want to exclude from our glorified
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:03:01.320]   State in the age to come the question boils down to whether or not God will design our glorified
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:09.080]   resurrection bodies in such a way that trembling attaches to the
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.440]   Experience of joy so as to intensify it
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:21.960]   Now how might we answer that question might God do that or should we expect him to do that and one way to answer?
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.560]   the question
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.040]   would be to examine whether trembling in the Bible is
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.960]   always attached to terror and is only negative and
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.240]   that's clearly not the case as
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.200]   We survey the scriptures several texts
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.280]   mentioned trembling
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.640]   precisely in connection with
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.560]   Good experiences of God not bad experiences of God
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.800]   so for example
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.640]   Psalm 114 7
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:02.760]   tremble o earth at the presence of the Lord at the presence of the God of Jacob who turns the rock into a
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.960]   pool of water and the flint into a spring
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.040]   well, what an occasion for trembling or
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:16.280]   Psalm 96 9 worship the Lord in the splendor of holiness
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.000]   tremble before him all the earth
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.840]   splendor holiness or
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:28.680]   Isaiah 66 1 thus says the Lord heaven is my throne the earth is my footstool
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.560]   What is the house? What is the house that you would build for me?
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:38.380]   What is the place of my rest all these things my hand has made in other words?
[00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:45.080]   I'm the great creator of all things and so all these things came to be declares the Lord
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:50.080]   but this is the one to whom I will look he who is humble and contrite in heart and
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:57.320]   trembles at my word as I am revealed as the creator of all things or
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.320]   Philippians 2 12
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:05.520]   Therefore my beloved as you have always obeyed so now not only in my presence
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.440]   but much more in my absence work out your salvation with fear and
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.040]   trembling and
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.280]   Here's the ground cause
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.680]   fear and trembling
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:22.400]   Because it is God who is at work in you to will and to do his good pleasure
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.800]   There's nothing negative about that at all. There's nothing terrifying about that at all except
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.840]   God is in us
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.560]   What what the creator of the universe is at work in?
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.480]   you
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.520]   If you believe that I mean if you really believe that
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:47.360]   Fear and trembling would be a wonderful response
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:53.280]   Even if you thought he were the most kind loving galactic power in the universe
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:59.160]   so my conclusion would be that we have little reason to think or
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.920]   desire that God's
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.440]   Trembling that that trembling before God
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:12.640]   In our glorified resurrection bodies would be excluded little little reason to think they should be little desire
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.780]   Why should we desire that trembling would be?
[00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.440]   excluded perhaps
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:23.520]   the safest thing to say is if God knows that
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:28.960]   the physical experience of trembling in the glorified body
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:36.520]   Will increase and intensify our enjoyment of him and all that he does and all that he makes
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:41.960]   He will see to it that we are capable of such a wonderful
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:48.960]   Trembling the professor John is a really important connection to our eternal joy and delight in God forever
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:52.520]   Pete thank you for the question and speaking of good questions
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:57.240]   Probably no question is more common this time of year than the question over Santa Claus
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:03.200]   What should Christian parents do with old st. Nick will tackle that on Monday?
