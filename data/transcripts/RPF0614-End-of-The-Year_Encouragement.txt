[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.640]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.120]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.720]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:42.360]   Today, as I record this show, it is the Friday before Christmas 2018.
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.840]   Specifically, it is Friday, December 1, 2018.
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:56.120]   It's 2.20 p.m. as I begin recording this show, in case you need a time stamp.
[00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.160]   As we close out this week, I didn't quite know what I wanted to say to you.
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.760]   I knew I wanted to record a show, and I had a bunch of topics.
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.480]   I've got all kinds of topics going, series going.
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.720]   I have no shortage of ideas.
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:09.720]   I have outlines prepared.
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.640]   I have shows already recorded that I could release to you, and yet it didn't feel right,
[00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:16.640]   most of those things.
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.880]   I thought I was going to do a show today on the deficit and do a, of course, very cheery
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.160]   end of the year show on the trillion dollar deficit in the United States of America this
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.160]   year.
[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.440]   That would be cheery right before the end of the year, but I thought, "This is good.
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.440]   This is useful."
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.040]   It just didn't feel right.
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.760]   I just want to turn on the microphone, just share a few simple thoughts with you to hopefully
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.280]   encourage you.
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.400]   Perhaps you're on an airplane, going to see family.
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.620]   Perhaps you're all alone, sitting in your apartment.
[00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.800]   Perhaps you're working at your desk over the weekend, feeling sorry for yourself.
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.400]   Perhaps you're driving along with your children, sleeping in the backseat.
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.880]   I just thought I wanted to share one simple thought with you.
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.160]   It's this.
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:10.600]   The biggest problems that you and I think about sometimes and worry about have never
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.440]   been more insoluble.
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.720]   They've never been more intractable.
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.680]   They've never been bigger.
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:39.240]   And yet, the real problems that you and I face have never been as soluble, as fixable.
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:45.160]   There's never been so much hope, so many opportunities, so many resources available to solve the things
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.840]   that are in front of us.
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:54.460]   But in order to experience success in solving those things, we have to turn our attention
[00:02:54.460 --> 00:03:00.640]   away from the macro problems that we can't solve and we can't affect to the things that
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.640]   we can.
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.160]   Now, I'm not expressing anything new.
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:11.080]   This concept is well-rooted by and well-talked about, well-preached about by many people.
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.120]   Focus on your circle of influence, not on your circle of concern.
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.120]   Absolutely.
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.040]   I'm not saying anything new.
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.760]   Just struck me in a new way today.
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.720]   I've long struggled with an addiction to the news.
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:32.000]   Perhaps like you, it's something that I have a hard time figuring out what the right way
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   to handle it is.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.600]   Some people say, well, don't ever pay any attention to it.
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:35.760]   Some people say, well, it's really important.
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.880]   And it seems to be a mixture of it.
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.520]   But oftentimes I've been sucked in by goings on and things like that.
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.400]   But thankfully, over past months, I've been free of those grips.
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.120]   I've not paid any attention.
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.520]   I don't, I've stopped reading news on the internet.
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.400]   I don't use social media.
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.240]   I don't have a TV.
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.920]   So very little has made it under my rock and it's been great.
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:00.920]   I felt good.
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:01.920]   I've been productive.
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.280]   It's been wonderful to be freed of that.
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:13.520]   Now I had to be a little hardcore to be freed of all that stuff, but it's been great.
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.400]   And so this afternoon when I wasn't quite sure what to do a show on, I just stopped
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.240]   for a moment and the place where I'm working right now has a TV.
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:29.320]   So I went and turned on the cable news and it was just insane to look at the news of
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:36.560]   the day again, Friday before Christmas and talking about war in Syria and secretary of
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:43.000]   defense, James Mattis resigning and government shutdown and people arguing and flipped around
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   the cable news channels.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.600]   And it was just insane, insane.
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.760]   And of course I had prepared this show outline for today to talk about trillion dollar deficits
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:53.760]   and deficits.
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.360]   And I thought, why don't we actually talk about this instead of, you know, a silly shutdown
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.360]   or a border wall or whatever the news du jour is.
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.160]   Like, why don't we talk about something that matters, this trillion dollar deficit.
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:11.480]   This is unprecedented, unprecedented for the US government to run a trillion dollar deficit
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:20.600]   in without there being a war or an economic recession or a crisis of any kind, unprecedented.
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:26.440]   And yet we're going to argue about other things.
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.960]   Now I understand that that's more important to me because of finances.
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.000]   I'm not saying other things aren't important, but there's the important stuff is, it's just
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   hardly ever talked about.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.240]   And I, anyway, I shut it off and I just, it made me depressed.
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:45.000]   And I thought, how do you, how do you get through this?
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.280]   So here's my observation.
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.800]   We live in an age of paradox.
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:06:01.960]   The paradox is this, in some ways, things have never been worse.
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.480]   In some ways, things have never been better.
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:13.360]   Example, I'm very concerned about much erosion of liberty and freedom, very concerning to
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.360]   me.
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.760]   So in some ways, things have never been worse.
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:22.760]   But on the other hand, in the history of mankind, it has never been easier for you and I to
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:23.760]   live freely.
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.360]   And it is right now.
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:35.880]   What a paradox where there's simultaneously good and bad extremes.
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:41.080]   In some ways, things have never been tougher.
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.920]   Wealth inequality has never been bigger.
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.160]   And yet in some ways, things have never been better.
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.720]   There's never been less poverty than there is right now.
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.860]   What a funny paradox.
[00:06:53.860 --> 00:07:04.600]   In some ways, you have never been more powerless than you are today.
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:08.920]   It's never mattered less whether you opened your mouth and said something.
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:13.120]   There's never mattered less if you cast a vote at a ballot box.
[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:21.920]   And yet in other ways, an individual human has never had more individual power than you
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:25.720]   have today.
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:31.320]   What a paradox.
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:36.560]   And yet what keeps us from making progress in those things that we can control is worry
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.360]   and concern over things we can't control.
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:46.160]   The big problems have never been bigger than they are now, never been more insoluble than
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.080]   they are now.
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:56.320]   And yet you and I have tremendous power to fix the problems in our life.
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:57.320]   I want to be a source of solutions.
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:01.440]   I want to be a source of encouragement, of insight, of education, just like I tell you
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:05.120]   every single day when I start the show.
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:07.000]   But I want to focus on things that you can do.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.720]   It doesn't mean I want to stay away from big picture things.
[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:15.360]   You need to be aware of the problems, but I want to always focus on things that are
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:20.960]   within reach because there's so much that's within reach that will make a big difference
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:24.080]   if you do it and I do it.
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:27.560]   And things are simple many times.
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:31.200]   Now once again, not all the time.
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:37.280]   There's a story that has always struck me and for context, there are a number of trends
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:40.360]   that I watch carefully that I'm very concerned about.
[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:45.480]   And one of the trends that really concerns me is the trend towards suicide in the United
[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:46.680]   States of America.
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:47.960]   It's deeply concerning towards me.
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:56.640]   It's an epidemic and it's a tough one because of course, as with any difficult thing, there
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.520]   are many, many influences for it.
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:03.400]   I was just thinking about suicide and preparing.
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:07.480]   I want to do this show for you, kind of the state of America, the things I've learned
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:11.280]   from traveling around the country for the last five or six months.
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:18.200]   And suicide is, of course, there are many factors involved, right?
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:22.800]   It's complex and yet in some ways it's simple.
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.560]   There's a story that's always haunted me.
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:31.360]   I guess two stories, but there was a famous story about a suicide note, about somebody
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:32.800]   who jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge.
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:38.360]   And a man wrote, when they went and found the suicide note at home, he wrote this.
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:42.200]   He says, "I'm walking to the bridge.
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:47.000]   If one person smiles at me on the way, I will not jump."
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.560]   That was years ago that that happened.
[00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:56.240]   But imagine somebody walking to the Golden Gate Bridge, they wrote a note, said, "I'm
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.840]   walking to the Golden Gate Bridge.
[00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:04.320]   If one person smiles at me on the way, I will not jump."
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:11.920]   Now that man today is dead.
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:14.120]   You figure out why.
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:17.720]   There's another story.
[00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:23.080]   There's a man named Kevin Hines who is one of the only, I think, if this is correct,
[00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:27.640]   anyway, one of only a couple of people who jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge and lived
[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:29.480]   to tell about it.
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:35.760]   And when he tells this story, he jumped off the bridge and he was actually held up by
[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:41.240]   a sea lion in the water until he was eventually rescued because he was severely injured.
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:47.040]   But when he tells this story about wanting to commit suicide, he went to the bridge and
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:54.400]   he stood there on the bridge staring at the railing for about 40 minutes or so, trying
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:57.280]   to decide whether he was going to jump.
[00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:01.320]   And people would walk by him and ignore him.
[00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:04.640]   And when he tells the story, he says, "You know, if someone had smiled and stopped and
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.520]   said, 'Are you okay?'
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:10.760]   All he wanted to do was to beg them for help and tell them what was going on and ask for
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:13.680]   help and he wouldn't have jumped."
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:20.200]   But he didn't feel like he had the courage to just ask for help himself.
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:24.120]   And you know, somebody did come by and ask him for help, but they asked him to take a
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:25.120]   picture for them.
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:29.520]   And they just walked away and he thought, "You know, nobody cares about me."
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:33.240]   And then he jumped off the bridge.
[00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:36.840]   While he was on his way down, he said, "Wait a second, this is crazy.
[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:37.840]   I want to live."
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:40.960]   But of course, he was hurtling through the air.
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.280]   And he was significantly injured.
[00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:46.520]   Today he's a public speaker and he speaks about suicide.
[00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:50.280]   But those stories, do they not haunt you?
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:59.240]   You think, could a life be saved by something as simple as a smile?
[00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:04.040]   In some cases, yes.
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:05.680]   And of course, in many cases, no.
[00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:08.040]   It's far more complex.
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:10.240]   The evil goes far deeper.
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:15.640]   The suicidal tendency has a far greater grip on somebody's life.
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:25.880]   So solutions are not super simple, but many of them are simple.
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:31.960]   I guess in summary, what I want to say is, in the next year, I want to continue to give
[00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:39.300]   you the most useful, actionable advice that I can that will help you.
[00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:43.640]   With the real challenge of building financial freedom in your life.
[00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:49.880]   And if you'll put that advice into practice, and if I'll put my own advice into practice,
[00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:58.600]   then I think you can build up a significantly easier path through the problems that we're
[00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:04.800]   going to face in the next year, the next decade, the next 40, 50 years.
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:08.080]   Those problems are going to be immense.
[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:18.040]   And there are no easy solutions to the big problems, at least that I can find.
[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:20.020]   They probably would have been put in place already.
[00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:23.080]   People are not stupid.
[00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:29.460]   But there are solutions for you.
[00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:34.320]   There are things that you can do.
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:40.520]   So as you go into the Christmas holidays, or you enjoy the time for the new year, don't
[00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:48.120]   miss the opportunities that are in front of you to smile at somebody, to give somebody
[00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:52.440]   a hug, to love somebody, to encourage somebody.
[00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:57.660]   Don't miss the opportunities that are in front of you to pay off your debts, or pay off the
[00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:01.000]   debt of another person.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.700]   Clean up your own mess, fix your income, cut your expenses.
[00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:13.200]   Don't miss the opportunities that are in front of you to invest wisely, avoid catastrophe,
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:16.920]   buy insurance.
[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:18.400]   Those things are doable.
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:22.360]   They're simple, but they're doable.
[00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:25.120]   So don't ignore those things.
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:30.240]   Don't miss the fact that you can reach out to your neighbor, you can reach out to your
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:32.560]   brother, to your sister.
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:38.080]   You can build community where you live so that as the community across the United States
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:47.980]   continues to fracture, segment, balkanize, continues to be torn asunder, your own community
[00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:51.240]   can be brought together.
[00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:54.500]   Don't miss the simple things.
[00:14:54.500 --> 00:15:02.680]   Take action on those, and then as the big problems develop, I think you can be well
[00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:07.960]   protected from those things.
[00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:12.240]   As I considered the emotions of this afternoon, just the things I was thinking about, I often
[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:16.440]   think in terms of songs.
[00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:21.520]   The song that came to me was the song called "Just One Voice."
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:26.080]   The lyrics say, "Just one voice, singing in the darkness.
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:30.240]   All it takes is one voice, singing so they hear what's on your mind.
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:34.160]   When you look around, you'll find there's more than one voice.
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:37.640]   Singing in the darkness, joining with your one voice.
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:41.800]   Each and every note another octave, hands are joined and fear is unlocked.
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:48.800]   If only one voice would start it on its own, we need just one voice facing the unknown.
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:51.440]   And that one voice would never be alone."
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:58.200]   I was thinking about that song and I was reflecting on Christmas and it's a very important holiday
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:02.780]   for billions of people all around the world.
[00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:06.960]   For many reasons, it's especially an important holiday for Christians.
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:12.400]   And I just was thinking about that song and I was thinking about it in light of the Christian
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:13.400]   holiday.
[00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:20.400]   If you ever think about the story of Christianity, it's one of the most improbable stories of
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:23.160]   all time.
[00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:31.440]   It's vanishingly improbable what the world looks like today.
[00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:39.040]   If you were to go back about 4,000 years and you were to look at a group of people who
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:50.280]   come from one relatively small family, a man named Abraham, who had a son named Isaac,
[00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:59.480]   who had a son named Jacob, who married two women and had 12 sons, one of whom was sold
[00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:03.800]   as a slave because his brothers didn't like him.
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:07.520]   Then that son was taken to Egypt.
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:11.200]   He became a servant and then he was accused of sexual assault, falsely accused of sexual
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:12.200]   assault.
[00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:13.200]   He was tossed into prison.
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:19.760]   He was in prison, what was it, 12 years, something like that, 12 years.
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:27.360]   And then the pharaoh of Egypt has a dream in the night that really bothers him, two
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:37.160]   dreams about some fat cows and some skinny cows and a dream about, what was it, the wheat
[00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:38.160]   and corn.
[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:39.960]   I have to go back and look at those dreams.
[00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:46.080]   But he has a dream in the night and nobody can interpret his dreams for him.
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:52.840]   So then a dude who had his dreams previously interpreted for him says, "Hey, guess what?
[00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:57.960]   I knew this guy in prison who interpreted one of my dreams when the cupbearer and I
[00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:03.160]   were there and both of the interpretations, the interpretation for the cupbearer and the
[00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:06.080]   interpretation for the steward, both of those interpretations are right.
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:09.200]   We're dealing with weird stuff, dreams, interpretations."
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:13.280]   So then Pharaoh goes down, sends for this dude in the prison, brings him out, tells
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:17.200]   him the dream and the dude interprets the dream.
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:25.720]   Pharaoh takes this guy and makes him second in command over all of Egypt, thus saving
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:31.200]   the Egyptian people from a time of seven years of starvation.
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:34.760]   And then this dude, his family shows up and he goes and gets his family and brings them
[00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:38.040]   all to Egypt, thus saving his family.
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:41.640]   Improbable enough yet?
[00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:46.960]   Now at this point in time, the people start to grow.
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:51.160]   And I don't know about you, but one of the things that we often have a hard time understanding
[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:56.800]   is what that ancient Egyptian culture was like.
[00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:00.680]   When I went to Egypt years ago, it totally rocked my world.
[00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:10.440]   We have this modern concept that there were primitive civilizations in the past.
[00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:15.240]   And this is based upon the evolutionary mind frame that basically controls almost all historical
[00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:19.020]   interpretation in today's world, that the people of old days were primitive and today
[00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:20.640]   were very modern and advanced.
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:24.640]   Well certainly, that's true in some cases, but it's not true in all cases.
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:31.440]   And we have this concept that past civilizations were just primitive, living in the cave after
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:32.440]   all.
[00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:38.800]   And we don't have any context of how incredibly sophisticated many past civilizations were.
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:45.400]   If you want to be disabused of that idea of primitivism, go to Egypt, stand in the temples,
[00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:47.400]   study the society, it's incredible.
[00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:56.520]   Anyway, so here's this guy, Joseph, and then you have a time where these people, all his
[00:19:56.520 --> 00:20:01.800]   siblings are protected and raised up for a while, and then they become slaves for what
[00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:05.360]   was it, 400 years, I think.
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:14.520]   So for 400 years, the descendants of Jacob and Abraham and Isaac, they're slaves, they're
[00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:16.600]   destroyed, they're beat on, they're slaves.
[00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:24.560]   And for 400 years, God says nothing, God does nothing, God is completely silent.
[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:31.240]   Until all of a sudden, this guy named Moses comes along, who as a baby was going to be
[00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:36.160]   killed until he was found by the princess.
[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:46.560]   And so he comes along and he leads the people, this weak people, out of slavery without fighting.
[00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:48.640]   Fighting a battle themselves.
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:55.320]   And they go from poverty to wealth because the Egyptians are so eager to get rid of them
[00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:58.960]   that when they're asked them for their gold, the Egyptians give it to them.
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:00.520]   That's very interesting.
[00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:07.200]   If you study the debate, the historical debate around the Exodus and the archaeological evidence
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:11.000]   for the Exodus and the lack of evidence for the Exodus, really interesting debate.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   I'll skip that for now.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.240]   But one of the things that is one of the clues that has to be looked into is that particular
[00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:21.560]   fact that you have a bunch of people that go from slaves to having all kinds of wealth
[00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:26.760]   because their slave masters were so eager to get rid of them.
[00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:31.760]   Then you have all of this history from about 1500 BC, you have the growth of the empire,
[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:37.800]   you have all the prophets, you have the growth of the Jewish empire, King David about 1000
[00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:38.800]   BC.
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:42.240]   Then you start to have all of these prophets, then you have these people then become slaves
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:47.120]   again, go into exile.
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:51.140]   And then fast forward through all the prophets, through all the exile, then you have another
[00:21:51.140 --> 00:22:00.880]   time when nothing, nothing, God doesn't do anything for 400 years.
[00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:06.200]   Doesn't speak, doesn't move, there are no recorded miracles.
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:18.560]   Just a group of people who are worshiping a God who is silent.
[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:31.480]   And then in one little place, a tiny little country called Israel, there's a boy born
[00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:40.920]   to a teenage girl and a very ordinary middle class or lower class, I don't know, peasant,
[00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:43.400]   guy named Joseph and Mary.
[00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:50.400]   And you have all of these incredible ideas of angelic visitations coming to Joseph and
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:55.280]   Mary and all of a sudden this guy is born, his name is Jesus.
[00:22:55.280 --> 00:23:03.160]   And for 30 years the man does nothing out of the ordinary.
[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:13.720]   Works in his father's carpentry shop, lives an ordinary life for 30 years.
[00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:18.520]   And then for about three and a half years, three to four years, something like that,
[00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:25.480]   goes on a ministry in one small little area and pursues a ministry of exorcism and healings
[00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:28.480]   and preaching.
[00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:35.840]   Spent the vast majority of his time with 12 men.
[00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:43.800]   In today's world we would call them boys, teenagers, with 12 teenage guys, perhaps one,
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:47.360]   perhaps Peter was almost 20 or somewhere around 20 or so.
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:56.800]   But he spends three years with 12 teenagers and then dies.
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:05.760]   Is put to death as a criminal on a garbage heap between a thief and a murderer.
[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:13.520]   Is put to death under false pretenses because of spouting religious heresy against the government
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:17.920]   control of that time.
[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:20.920]   His entire people are in shambles.
[00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:27.000]   Not even his own family believes in him, his blood brothers, his mom.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.960]   And then three days later something happens.
[00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:38.480]   And those 12 men who were utterly devastated by the death of the person they thought was
[00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:46.280]   going to save them from all of the oppression and the slavery that they were under, everything
[00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:48.720]   changed.
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:51.680]   You know the story from there.
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:58.000]   So then fast forward to today, you look back over the last two millennia of time and the
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:08.720]   world has been on fire since then over the claims and the life and the existence of that
[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:14.040]   one man, Jesus.
[00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:23.720]   You cannot trace the arc of history without reckoning with him.
[00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:27.480]   And yet can you think of a more improbable event?
[00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:31.400]   Can you think of a more unlikely circumstance?
[00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:35.160]   Now there've been a lot of unlikely things that have happened in human history, but for
[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:47.640]   the entire world to be set on fire over the life, the birth, the death, the resurrection
[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:52.760]   of one man from two millennia ago.
[00:25:52.760 --> 00:26:00.240]   And today the debates rage, the scholarship rages, the wars rage, the violence rages,
[00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:08.480]   the love goes and rages, peace, war, everything around the world.
[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:12.260]   The most influential one, that one man.
[00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:17.520]   And then today, of course, Christmas, people remember his birth, one of the most improbable
[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:29.360]   events recorded in history due to the circumstances of that birth, all coalescing around something
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:33.440]   that I'm convinced nobody really knew about during his life.
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:38.800]   Today, you know, the circumstances of the birth of Christ are well known and well documented,
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:40.240]   well discussed all around the world.
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:47.040]   I'm personally persuaded that very few of the disciples knew anything about the circumstances
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:50.240]   of the birth of Jesus.
[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:54.760]   Really the only place that all of the circumstances that today are so well known is recorded in
[00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:56.000]   the book of Luke.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:03.520]   And the book of Luke, of course, was written by someone who never personally knew Jesus,
[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:09.880]   was not one of the 12 disciples, was not even a Jew, but was a Syrian.
[00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:10.880]   How's that word?
[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:13.840]   How's that for today with the US troops pulling out of Syria?
[00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:23.520]   Was a Syrian physician, a Syrian medical doctor who later came and researched all of the details
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:31.440]   surrounding the birth of Jesus, spoke to his mother, spoke to his family members, and then
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:35.000]   recorded all those things and created, as he says, even in the beginning of the book
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.260]   of Luke, an orderly history of the account of the life of Christ, which is where today
[00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:40.720]   we get all that information from.
[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:42.520]   I don't think any, it's my own opinion.
[00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:50.000]   I don't think anybody knew about the birth of Jesus during his lifetime in the sense
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.680]   of they didn't know about the details that today are so commonly referred to as the Christmas
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:55.680]   story.
[00:27:55.680 --> 00:28:00.320]   Now, of course, we do have some of the information recorded in the book of Matthew, so perhaps
[00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:02.240]   I'm wrong about that.
[00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:10.360]   But regardless, the point is, fast forward 2,000 years and in a few days, the majority
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:19.200]   of the world's population will observe a day, a holiday, recording the birth of one man
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:24.080]   a couple thousand years ago, and that's not even the day that was the actual birth, which
[00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:27.160]   is its own unique history.
[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:31.880]   The most likely day of the actual birth day of Jesus, of course, being late September,
[00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:32.960]   early October.
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:37.720]   So to bring that to that, my point in all that, forgive me if I went on too long, the
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:40.960]   point of all that is to say one man.
[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:47.880]   Now, of course, I would say not to diminish the deity of Christ, which I would happily
[00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:52.160]   and easily talk about, one God, but one man.
[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:56.720]   And if you look back in the story, you could see again and again, one man, one man, one
[00:28:56.720 --> 00:29:02.600]   man, one woman, one man, one person.
[00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:08.960]   And the actions of one person having an effect through human history.
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:16.160]   Now, most of the time, those individual people are never recorded.
[00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:21.560]   They never show up in a history book, and yet one person can make an impact, can make
[00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:22.760]   an effect.
[00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:25.800]   So I went long there.
[00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:29.480]   It's just such a fascinating story to me.
[00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:37.040]   And I think about it a lot at Christmas, just thinking about the impact of one man.
[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:46.200]   And at one tiny point in history, one tiny nation out of a tiny, endlessly persecuted
[00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:50.480]   group of people, and yet look at the world today.
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:55.880]   Now, to be clear, I'm not Jesus and you're not either.
[00:29:55.880 --> 00:30:01.640]   So I don't want anything to do with that kind of idea.
[00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:07.160]   Just simply that one voice matters, yours.
[00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:08.160]   Here's my commitment to you.
[00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:13.640]   This next year, I will work very diligently to give you everything I can to help you make
[00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:16.560]   an impact where you are.
[00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:18.800]   And I'll do my best to make an impact where I am.
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:22.280]   I'm not going to worry about the big problems, except to be aware of them and then try to
[00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:24.680]   help you know what you could do for yourself.
[00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:30.640]   But if you do that and I do that, and your brother, your sister, your neighbor, your
[00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:36.840]   dad, your mom, your children do that, in time, things can change.
[00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:41.840]   Things in the short term never change as much as we want them to, but in the long term,
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:45.840]   things can change far more than we would like.
[00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:49.000]   So I'll close with, I'll play you that song.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.400]   I'll close simply with that song.
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:51.400]   I hope you'll enjoy it.
[00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:52.400]   Merry Christmas to you.
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:58.060]   I'll be back with you on Monday, January 7th for an exciting new year of Radical Personal
[00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:02.060]   Finance.
[00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:13.180]   Just one voice singing in the darkness.
[00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:22.720]   All it takes is one voice singing so they hear what's on your mind.
[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:31.600]   And when you look around, you'll find there's more than one voice singing in the darkness.
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:43.560]   Singing in the darkness, joining with your one voice.
[00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:49.600]   Each and every note, another octave, hands are joined and fears unlocked.
[00:31:49.600 --> 00:32:00.040]   If only one voice would start out on its own, we need just one voice.
[00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:07.920]   Facing the unknown and then that one voice would never be alone.
[00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:15.680]   It takes that one, one voice.
[00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:26.440]   Just one voice singing in the darkness.
[00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:31.120]   All it takes is one voice.
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:39.280]   Shout it out and let it ring.
[00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:43.840]   Just one voice.
[00:32:43.840 --> 00:33:05.920]   It takes that one voice and everyone will see.
[00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:30.720]   Once I stood in the light with my head bowed low.
[00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:58.560]   I looked in the darkness as black as could be.
[00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:05.560]   Hold my hand all the way.
[00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:10.560]   Every hour, every day.
[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:21.560]   From here to the great unknown.
[00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:28.560]   Take my hand.
[00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:43.560]   Let me stand where no one stands alone.
[00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:52.560]   Like a king, I may live in a palace so tall.
[00:34:52.560 --> 00:35:02.560]   With great riches to call on my own.
[00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:13.560]   But I don't know a thing in this whole wide world.
[00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:22.560]   That's worse than being alone.
[00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:27.560]   Hold my hand all the way.
[00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:32.560]   Every hour, every day.
[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:43.560]   From here to the great unknown.
[00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:48.560]   Take my hand.
[00:35:48.560 --> 00:36:03.560]   Let me stand where no one stands alone.
[00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:08.560]   Take my hand.
[00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:34.560]   Let me stand where no one stands alone.
[00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:46.560]   [APPLAUSE]
