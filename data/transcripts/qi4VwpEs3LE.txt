[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:03.680]   where we discuss science
[00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.840]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.420]   [upbeat music]
[00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:10.440]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.520]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.480]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.000]   My guest today is Dr. Becky Kennedy.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.380]   Dr. Becky Kennedy is a clinical psychologist
[00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.240]   and one of the world's foremost experts
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.160]   in parent-child relationships.
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.200]   Now, you may or may not have children.
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.320]   If you do, today's episode is absolutely for you.
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.080]   If you don't, well, you were once a child.
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.960]   Perhaps you're even still a child.
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.360]   Today's episode also will have valuable knowledge
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.840]   and tools that you can apply to your life.
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.640]   Today, Dr. Becky Kennedy teaches us an immense number
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.920]   of extremely valuable tools for the workplace,
[00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.460]   for romantic relationships,
[00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.400]   for family relationships of all types,
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.080]   not just parent-child relationships,
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.340]   and of course, also for parent-child relationships.
[00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.880]   We discuss themes that have not been discussed previously
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.920]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast, topics such as guilt,
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.260]   which Dr. Becky Kennedy offers
[00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.940]   a completely unique perspective on,
[00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.280]   one that I've never heard before,
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.880]   and that, frankly, I don't think anyone has heard before.
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:06.920]   In fact, she distinguishes
[00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.180]   between what most people think is guilt
[00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.480]   and an entirely different set of emotions,
[00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.960]   and offers you very useful practical tools
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.720]   for when you experience guilt and how to work with guilt.
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.040]   We also extensively discuss frustration,
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.580]   or what she calls frustration tolerance.
[00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.520]   Frustration tolerance is an extremely important theme
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.960]   for everybody to understand and apply in their lives,
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.440]   because frustration tolerance,
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.040]   as Dr. Becky Kennedy so aptly points out,
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.240]   is central to the learning process of anything at every age.
[00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.840]   If you can understand this concept
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.040]   and you apply some of the very simple rules and tools
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.440]   that Dr. Kennedy explains during the podcast,
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.160]   I assure you, you can learn many more things
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.440]   much more quickly and with much greater satisfaction,
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.800]   if not during the process,
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.740]   certainly at the end when you master that learning.
[00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.160]   And those are just a few of the themes
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.660]   that we discussed during today's episode.
[00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.680]   Again, whether or not you have children,
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.320]   I assure you that today's episode
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.080]   is going to be immensely beneficial
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.160]   for all of your relationships.
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.080]   You will notice during today's episode
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.480]   that our studio backdrop is different.
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.320]   You will notice that for once,
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.840]   I was not wearing this particular style of shirt.
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.120]   The reason for that is that this episode was recorded
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.660]   during the LA fires,
[00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.360]   what was initially called the Palisades fire,
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.460]   and then spread to multiple fires throughout LA County.
[00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.280]   So we were not able to access our normal studio.
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.840]   So I want to express extreme gratitude to Rich Roll,
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.820]   our good friend in the podcasting space,
[00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.060]   who allowed us to use his podcast studio,
[00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.640]   which is where I'm seated now,
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.300]   and where I held the discussion with Dr. Becky Kennedy.
[00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.000]   First off, our entire team,
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.660]   our homes and our studio are fine.
[00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:40.680]   I can assure you of that.
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.280]   But most importantly,
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.440]   our thoughts and our prayers go out to the people
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.580]   who have lost their homes, lost pets,
[00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.840]   and sadly there have been fatalities during the LA fires.
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.480]   So our thoughts and prayers are with them
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.040]   and their families, and we hope everyone remains safe.
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.680]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.340]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.240]   It is however, part of my desire and effort
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.040]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.920]   about science and science-related tools
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.120]   to the general public.
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.320]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.760]   today's episode does include sponsors.
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.900]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Becky Kennedy.
[00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.620]   Dr. Becky Kennedy, welcome back.
[00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.400]   - I'm so happy to be here.
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.960]   Grateful to Rich Roll for lending us his studio
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.000]   under the duress of fires in Los Angeles.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.700]   I'm praying that his home is okay.
[00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.640]   It's unclear at this moment, but in any event,
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.820]   let's talk about emotions, both theory and practice.
[00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.580]   And if we can place it in the context of parenting,
[00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:40.420]   that would be great,
[00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.220]   but I'm certain that this has a broader theme
[00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.940]   that pertains to everybody.
[00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.680]   So I love the theory of emotions
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.340]   or how we would theoretically respond to something,
[00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.840]   but then there's the reality.
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.840]   So as a parent, let's say you have a stance in your home
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.800]   and in your family that it's okay to be sad.
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.480]   Like sadness is normal, it happens, it passes, et cetera.
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.700]   Let's say you're feeling particularly sad about something.
[00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.120]   Do you express that and show that in front of your kids?
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.800]   Because I've also heard that young kids in particular,
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.480]   younger than eight or nine,
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.440]   perhaps shouldn't be aware that their parents
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.480]   are experiencing say extreme sadness
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.280]   because it can be scary to them
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.380]   or they might feel like their world is destabilizing.
[00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.080]   And then we also hear a lot about kids feeling
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.840]   like they had to parent the parents
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.520]   and then this whole thing becomes pretty complicated.
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.000]   So while there's no perfect world
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.420]   where one knows what to do every single time,
[00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:44.260]   how do you look at this business of modeling emotions
[00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.440]   and also encouraging kids to be able to experience
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.240]   and express their emotions?
[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.480]   - Yeah, and I think everything I'm about to share
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.400]   applies in the workplace, right?
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.340]   Like can a boss be really upset
[00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.240]   in front of the person they manage, management, right?
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.780]   So it's all the same stuff.
[00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.580]   So I guess zooming out as a start,
[00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:08.860]   emotions are normal, emotions are unstoppable.
[00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.660]   You can't not feel sad just because you have
[00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.180]   your five-year-old in the room, right?
[00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.000]   And I think the other thing that kind of forms
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.260]   my perspective is it's really hard
[00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.900]   to not show someone that you're sad.
[00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.280]   Like you might think you're doing that well,
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.960]   but kids are extra perceptive.
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.860]   They are actually built to be more perceptive than we are
[00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.740]   because their survival depends on adults.
[00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.940]   So they have to always notice, is my adult around?
[00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:37.900]   Is my adult okay?
[00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.900]   So they really attune to what's going on for us, right?
[00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.300]   And so I think the kind of question is less,
[00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.260]   do I show my emotions to my kid or not?
[00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:53.520]   And it's more, okay, if I'm sad, my kid is gonna notice.
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.560]   What do I do then?
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.960]   And as a principal, one of the things I think about often
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.940]   is information doesn't scare kids
[00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:05.220]   as much as the absence of information scares kids.
[00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:09.240]   So let's say there's something really awful.
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.540]   I don't know, as a parent, you're a family member,
[00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:13.860]   someone died of cancer.
[00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.660]   I don't know, there's something really horrible
[00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.180]   that you just found out, right?
[00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:19.580]   There's wildfires right now.
[00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.260]   Let's say you evacuated and you found out
[00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.680]   your house burned down, you're sad.
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.120]   Your child is going to notice that
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.020]   and you want your child to notice that.
[00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:34.940]   You don't want your kid to be a teenager, an adult,
[00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:39.060]   who goes around the world unable to pick up
[00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.060]   on emotional cues from other people.
[00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:42.760]   That's not adaptive.
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:46.700]   And so the patterns we set with our kids when they're young
[00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:50.860]   inform their view of the world when they're older.
[00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.820]   And so here I am, let's say it's the situation
[00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:55.700]   of somebody dying and I'm upset.
[00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:57.860]   First of all, as a parent, tell yourself,
[00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:01.480]   it's not my kid seeing me sad
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.940]   that's going to destabilize them.
[00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:08.800]   It's seeing me sad and me making up a bogus story
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.740]   or denying it because then my kid goes,
[00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:13.020]   pretty sure my mom was upset.
[00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:13.980]   Oh, she's not?
[00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:15.780]   Oh, she's pretending like nothing happened?
[00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:19.140]   Oh, she looks sad, but she's saying she's not sad.
[00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:20.940]   That is really upsetting.
[00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:24.340]   It would be like hearing your boss say,
[00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:26.740]   oh yeah, 20% layoffs, what are we doing?
[00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:27.580]   I don't know.
[00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.780]   Oh, hi, everything's great, how are you?
[00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:31.100]   Like, what is happening?
[00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:31.940]   - Scary.
[00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:32.980]   - What you'd want is your boss say,
[00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:34.340]   you just heard something.
[00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:35.740]   You were right to hear that.
[00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:40.100]   We are about to go through a really tough time.
[00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:42.020]   I'm stressed about it, that's why I yelled.
[00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:44.760]   You might be stressed, here's what I know.
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:45.600]   This is going to be hard
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.200]   and we're going to get through it together.
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.980]   Now, all of a sudden,
[00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:52.120]   that emotional experience has a container.
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:53.360]   It has a story.
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:56.600]   Humans need stories, we like stories.
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.200]   And so often we think it's the emotions
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.840]   that dysregulate a kid.
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:03.960]   It's the lack of a story to explain it.
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:06.360]   So let's say this really did happen.
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.200]   People always say to me,
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:09.800]   okay, but Dr. Becky, like my kid is four.
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.680]   I'm going to say that their aunt died.
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.200]   They don't even know cancer, right?
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:15.640]   We don't have a better alternative.
[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.320]   I can't even tell you how many parents I've seen
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.400]   whose kids have all of these issues
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:20.800]   because of the made up stories.
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.000]   I just said she went to sleep for a while.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:23.840]   Six months later,
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.820]   my kid has a lot of trouble sleeping through the night.
[00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:27.400]   Yeah, they haven't seen their aunt
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:28.780]   who went to sleep one time.
[00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:30.880]   Creates a huge issue,
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.640]   no matter what bogus story you make up.
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:35.680]   Kids can handle the truth
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:38.920]   and they can handle the truth when it's told to them
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:40.400]   from a loving, trusted adult.
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.000]   It's kind of like me and you.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.320]   Someone can tell us a hard truth,
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.680]   but it's from someone you feel safe with
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:48.040]   and that you feel like also believes in you
[00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:49.500]   and says it honestly.
[00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:52.560]   It might be hard, but it doesn't feel awful.
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:57.560]   So it's about saying to your kid, you saw me crying.
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:00.000]   One of my favorite kind of sentences
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.240]   to say to kids around this,
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.960]   'cause I think it really builds their confidence,
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:07.760]   is just, you were right to notice that I was crying
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:08.800]   and I'm feeling sad.
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.200]   And look, you saw that.
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.440]   I'm gonna tell you why.
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.920]   Making this up.
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.600]   Aunt Sally died.
[00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:18.460]   Do you know what dying means?
[00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:22.600]   Dying is when someone's body stops working.
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:23.700]   Then I pause.
[00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:24.760]   Right, so it'll just be a monologue.
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:26.160]   I'll see how my kid responds.
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:29.840]   I might add, I'm not dying.
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:32.840]   Kids actually really need to hear that in hard times.
[00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.560]   I'm not dying.
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.840]   No one else is dying.
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:37.920]   I'm safe.
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.280]   And you know what?
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.000]   I'm sad.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.900]   And I'm still your strong mom who can take care of you.
[00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:47.980]   That sets the stage for such resilience
[00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:52.180]   and is kind of the opposite of everything's fine.
[00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:54.040]   My kid keeps seeing me crying.
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:56.160]   They keep hearing words they're not used to hearing,
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:59.520]   die, cancer, Aunt Sally, funeral, whatever it is.
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:02.880]   That situation is what makes kids feel really,
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.620]   really uncomfortable and unsafe.
[00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:10.680]   So it's the absence of information that causes the harm.
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:11.520]   Yeah.
[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.500]   And it's the lack of coherence
[00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:15.920]   between what they're observing and feeling
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:19.080]   and kind of this like open loop.
[00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:22.660]   If I kind of place it in neuroscience-y terms,
[00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:26.560]   I feel like the brain does think in terms of stories.
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:28.440]   Stories have a beginning, middle, and an end,
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:31.280]   and they kind of want to know where they are in that story.
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:32.240]   That's exactly right.
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.640]   And the terms I would use to match your terms
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:37.760]   are coherent narrative.
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:38.600]   What is therapy?
[00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:39.640]   Why does therapy help people?
[00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:40.480]   It's interesting.
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.200]   Therapy doesn't change what happened to you.
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:43.560]   Therapy doesn't change your past.
[00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:46.200]   Therapy does not take away the pain,
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:50.920]   but the pain was never the thing that really got in our way.
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:52.760]   It was the pain plus a lack
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:55.320]   of a coherent narrative and support.
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:57.960]   And so early on, when kids have painful experiences
[00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.240]   from witnessing you or something else,
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:03.240]   giving them a coherent narrative is what they need.
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.680]   And without that, the way I think about it is
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:08.780]   they have what I call unformulated experience.
[00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:11.240]   It's just affect and experience
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:15.400]   that kind of free floats in their body, unformulated,
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:18.640]   that tends to later show up as triggers, right?
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.760]   And kind of other things in adulthood.
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:21.600]   And so, yeah,
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.680]   that's what we want to try to avoid when we can.
[00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:25.860]   I'd like to take a quick break
[00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:28.160]   and thank one of our sponsors, Wealthfront.
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:29.940]   I've been using Wealthfront for my savings
[00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:31.920]   and my investing for nearly a decade,
[00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:33.700]   and I absolutely love it.
[00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:36.000]   Every January, I set new goals for the year.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.880]   And one of my goals for 2025 is to focus on saving money.
[00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:41.000]   Since I have Wealthfront,
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.640]   I'll keep that savings in my Wealthfront cash account
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:46.140]   where I'm able to earn 4% annual percentage yield
[00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:48.320]   on my deposits, and you can as well.
[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:51.520]   With Wealthfront, you can earn 4% APY on your cash
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:53.000]   from partner banks until you're ready
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.200]   to either spend that money or invest it.
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.640]   With Wealthfront, you also get free instant withdrawals
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:59.500]   to eligible accounts every day,
[00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:01.120]   even on weekends and holidays.
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:03.800]   The 4% APY is not a promotional rate.
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.840]   There's no limit to what you can deposit and earn,
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:08.680]   and you can even get protection of up to $8 million
[00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:10.620]   through FDIC insurance provided
[00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:12.280]   through Wealthfront's partner banks.
[00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.400]   Wealthfront gives you free instant withdrawals

[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:21.800]   from the cash account
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:24.120]   to any of Wealthfront's automated investment accounts
[00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:25.640]   when you're ready to invest.

[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:49.040]   This has been a paid testimonial of Wealthfront.
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:50.880]   Wealthfront brokerage isn't a bank.
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:52.480]   The APY is subject to change.
[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:55.220]   For more information, see the episode description.
[00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:58.240]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Our Place.
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:01.640]   Our Place makes my favorite pots, pans, and other cookware.
[00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:04.360]   Surprisingly, toxic compounds such as the PFASs
[00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:07.280]   or forever chemicals are still found in 80%
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:10.200]   of nonstick pans, as well as utensils, appliances,
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.060]   and countless other kitchen products.
[00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:13.800]   As I've discussed on this podcast,
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:16.640]   these PFASs or forever chemicals like Teflon
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:18.160]   have been linked to major health issues
[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:21.160]   such as endocrine disruption, gut microbiome disruption,
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:23.800]   fertility issues, and many other health problems.
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:25.900]   So it's really important to avoid them.
[00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:27.440]   This is why I've recently fallen in love
[00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:29.040]   with Our Place products,
[00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:30.520]   especially one of their cooking pans,
[00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.720]   the Titanium Always Pan Pro.
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:33.840]   Our Place products are made
[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:35.360]   with the highest quality materials
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:37.920]   and are all PFAS and toxin free.
[00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:41.000]   They're beautifully designed and function extremely well.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.760]   As I mentioned, I love the Titanium Always Pan Pro
[00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:44.800]   from Our Place.
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.400]   I cook eggs in it most mornings
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:48.480]   and the titanium pan is designed in a way
[00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:50.280]   that allows the eggs to cook perfectly
[00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:51.740]   without sticking to the pan.
[00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:53.000]   I also cook burgers on it
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.760]   and it really puts a nice sear on the burger
[00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:56.440]   without the meat sticking to the pan.
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:57.800]   It's extremely easy to clean
[00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:59.780]   and like all Our Place products,
[00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:01.280]   it's nice to look at when sitting out
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:02.640]   on the counter or stove.
[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:03.480]   For a limited time,

[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:26.120]   with zero risk.
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:29.120]   I can't help but put this neuroscience lens on this
[00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:31.680]   'cause I find it so interesting
[00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:34.160]   that what you're basically saying,
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:35.160]   if I understand correctly,
[00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:37.960]   is that until we can place things into a story,
[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:40.400]   which is really a sense of beginning, middle and end,
[00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:42.280]   a sense of time,
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:44.480]   it just reverberates in us.
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.720]   I mean, I think I can't help myself.
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:49.040]   You know, I don't wanna give the impression
[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:51.000]   we've got fires burning all around us
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:51.880]   in terms of this building,
[00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:54.040]   but with some distance between us and the fires,
[00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:54.880]   that's actually true.
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:57.940]   And I think one of the things that's so destabilizing
[00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:00.080]   for kids and adults in this kind of circumstance
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:02.800]   is that we don't know how this is gonna work out.
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:03.640]   We just don't.
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:05.880]   And of course, none of us have a crystal ball.
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:07.440]   We can't peer into the future,
[00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:08.600]   but it's the not knowing
[00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:11.400]   that really extends our brain resources.
[00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:13.200]   And I can imagine that for a kid,
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:15.680]   seeing their parent upset and then hearing,
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:18.160]   well, no, I'm okay, I'm okay,
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.560]   would create this kind of open loop
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:23.200]   where then the kid has to worry about it.
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:25.000]   Like, when will this come to an end?
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:31.120]   One question about expressing sadness in front of a child,
[00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:34.420]   and if, let's say, somebody expresses why they're sad,
[00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:38.920]   is it okay to accept consolation from the kid?
[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:42.280]   Because we hear so much that we shouldn't have to parent.
[00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:44.640]   As children, we shouldn't have to parent our parents.
[00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:45.880]   And this is a big theme,
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:48.040]   especially on social media nowadays.
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:49.960]   Were you the parent to your parent?
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:51.720]   Were you the one that took out the trash
[00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:52.800]   when someone else should have done it
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:55.300]   and therefore you took on more responsibilities?
[00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:56.140]   I don't want kids to think
[00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:56.980]   they shouldn't take out the trash,
[00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:58.400]   but you know what I mean?
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:01.640]   But if you're consoling a parent about a lost job,
[00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:03.480]   if you're the kid, rather,
[00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:05.920]   that is sort of the go-between between the parents,
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:07.160]   is sort of acting as therapist,
[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:09.760]   we hear about this a lot, a lot.
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:11.520]   And I think a lot of people peer into their past
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:14.600]   and say, yeah, I grew up way too fast.
[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:15.440]   - Right, yeah.
[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:18.120]   - So on the other hand, I think we would all agree
[00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:22.120]   that being a empathic person,
[00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:24.440]   teaching our kids that if somebody's crying,
[00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:26.520]   you can walk over to that person, perhaps,
[00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:28.880]   and just say, you know, do you want me to sit with you?
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:30.280]   Or maybe do nothing at all.
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:32.320]   Maybe offer a solution, maybe not.
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:34.560]   But at least, you know, provide some sort of support.
[00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:36.360]   That seems healthy.
[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:37.400]   But the basic question is,
[00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:41.480]   should parents accept consolation from children
[00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:43.000]   when the parent is sad
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.560]   or experiencing some other negative emotion?
[00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:47.160]   - I think this is a great question.
[00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:48.640]   There's a couple things that are coming to mind.
[00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:49.480]   So first of all,
[00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:52.840]   all of this is a matter of extent and patterning.
[00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:57.040]   Yes, we do not want our kids to feel like it is their job
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:59.280]   to take care of our emotions.
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:00.760]   It's not a good situation.
[00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:04.280]   And I think the difference here actually comes down
[00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:07.640]   to what the true definition of empathy is.
[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:10.280]   To me, empathy is noticing someone's feelings
[00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:12.520]   and caring about them.
[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:16.240]   It's not taking care of them.
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:17.320]   That's a big difference.
[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:19.960]   So let's say I'm crying and my kid comes over
[00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:22.960]   and this whole situation, maybe somebody died.
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:24.560]   And they're like, oh my goodness, mom,
[00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:25.920]   can I give you a hug?
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:29.200]   And do you want me to get you a cup of water?
[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:30.040]   Okay, I just want parents to know,
[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:31.480]   you don't have to say, no, no,
[00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:33.680]   I do not want you to be a parentified child.
[00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:37.720]   Like, be like, that is so, that is so kind.
[00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:39.040]   Yes, that would feel great.
[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:41.080]   Okay, that's totally fine.
[00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:42.960]   I think the line is, and every parent
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:44.840]   just knows this for themselves,
[00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:46.880]   where it might get to, oh, you know what?
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:50.000]   I love that you're noticing I'm sad.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.760]   And I love that you care about that.
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:53.520]   And I also want to let you know,
[00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:57.760]   those are my feelings, not yours.
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:01.680]   And I am really able to take care of them myself
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:04.400]   with whoever is a friend.
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:06.600]   And you're still really allowed to be a kid
[00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:09.760]   who can go play, who can go have fun,
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:11.480]   who can even not listen to me once in a while
[00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:13.000]   when I say it's bath time.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.760]   That's actually your job.
[00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:17.080]   So let's go do our jobs well.
[00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:19.840]   And to me, that comes down to what empathy is,
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:22.160]   the delineation of like, what is a parent's job
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.360]   and what is a kid's job?
[00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:27.400]   But also, I think all of this can get misrepresented
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:28.880]   in social media.
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:30.240]   And I don't want parents to think
[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:32.120]   that they always have to chastise their kid
[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:33.480]   for acting in a caring way.
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:36.920]   - I feel like kids are, as you said before,
[00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:39.160]   kids are so perceptive about what their parents
[00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:42.120]   are experiencing and they'll create
[00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:46.000]   or move towards all sorts of emotional gymnastics
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.240]   in order to work with that.
[00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:49.840]   Years ago, I saw, I think it was a YouTube video
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:52.200]   with Jim Carrey, who basically revealed
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:57.200]   that he became funny as a way to make his sick mom laugh,
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:59.840]   that he grew up with a very sick mom,
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:01.280]   which is chronically ill.
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:03.680]   And so he would like throw himself down the stairs
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:05.080]   and try and make her laugh or do, you know,
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:09.600]   and he was an incredible world-class physical comic,
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:12.280]   among other aspects of comedy.
[00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:13.840]   But that his whole career was born out
[00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:16.440]   of this childhood tendency to notice
[00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:18.400]   that his mom was really hurting
[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:20.720]   and try and basically make her laugh,
[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:22.600]   make her feel something good.
[00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:24.680]   And, you know, now I'm thinking about this
[00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:27.120]   because it's just incredible the way
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:28.560]   that kids can pick up on something
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:31.720]   and then try and find a solution to it.
[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:33.080]   You know, I could imagine that for kids
[00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:36.880]   who have a sick parent, it could be mental challenges
[00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:39.840]   or physical challenges that they've got to notice.
[00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:40.680]   - Yes.
[00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:42.040]   - And in the case of Jim Carrey,
[00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:43.520]   one could argue whether or not it was adaptive
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:44.360]   or not adaptive.
[00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:46.600]   He had this, you know, meteoric career,
[00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:48.760]   but eventually just left it,
[00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:50.480]   decided that wasn't what he wanted to do.
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:51.840]   - Yeah.
[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:54.800]   - But leaving that extreme example aside,
[00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:57.040]   let's say a parent is sick with the flu
[00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:00.000]   or is grieving the loss of, you know,
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.240]   God forbid, a spouse or something really major.
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:05.080]   - Yeah.
[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:09.800]   - At what point does the parent need to say,
[00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:11.680]   "Listen, I'm really hurting.
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:16.200]   This is bad and I can handle it."
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:18.960]   When that might not actually be true.
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:20.440]   So the question is, you know,
[00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:24.120]   how much information to give kids.
[00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:24.960]   - Yeah.
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:26.120]   - Because you don't want to lie to them.
[00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:27.960]   On the other hand, you don't want them
[00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:32.120]   to feel the burden of needing to worry about a circumstance.
[00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:34.320]   And I'm framing this in the context of sick parent,
[00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:38.280]   but I'm also raising this thing of financial worries.
[00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:39.120]   - Yeah.
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:42.640]   - I have a close friend who told me that growing up,
[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:47.600]   their parent was constantly dealing with, you know,
[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:48.800]   moving from one job to the next.
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:50.200]   It was like this issue of whether or not
[00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:51.840]   we're going to have enough resources
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:55.320]   to get through the next year was a constant question.
[00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:58.440]   And this person is now in their mid thirties
[00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:00.200]   and you can tell it still haunts them.
[00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:01.800]   And it's completely shaped their relationship
[00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:02.760]   to work and finances.
[00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:03.600]   - Yeah.
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:04.440]   - Yeah.
[00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:06.720]   - I mean, I think we can think about this compared to,
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:08.800]   like, what would I want for my boss?
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:10.280]   I have a boss who's, I don't know,
[00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:11.840]   going through a really hard time
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:13.680]   or having a really hard time at home.
[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:15.160]   And I kind of notice it.
[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:17.400]   I'd probably want my boss to level with me and say,
[00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:18.840]   kind of again, "You're right to notice
[00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:20.400]   I'm going through a hard time."
[00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:23.960]   But at what point would it feel like,
[00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:27.560]   "Ooh, am I safe in this organization?"
[00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:28.400]   Right?
[00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:29.920]   I think we probably all have a point there.
[00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:32.240]   And I think it's the same thing with kids.
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:37.160]   Kids really do need to feel like they have sturdy parents.
[00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:38.640]   Again, I always go back to pilots
[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:41.160]   because I think airplane examples are so powerful
[00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:43.640]   because there's very few times in adulthood
[00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:46.800]   that we actually feel like our safety is truly dependent
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:49.520]   on another adult, like a hundred percent.
[00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:51.520]   When you're a passenger in an airplane,
[00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:53.280]   you are 100% dependent.
[00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:55.280]   So it's kind of the closest dynamic.
[00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:58.240]   And you can imagine what it would be like
[00:21:58.240 --> 00:21:59.080]   if the pilot was saying,
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:00.400]   "I'm going through a really hard time.
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:02.680]   Who wants to come in and give me, you know,
[00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:05.040]   I don't know, you know, tell me a nice story."
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:06.200]   You'd be like, "Oh my goodness.
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:08.120]   Like, I get you're going through a hard time,
[00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:10.080]   but this is really not feeling great."
[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:11.280]   Right?
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:13.400]   And what that means and which is, you know,
[00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:16.280]   kind of even a larger point is if you're a pilot,
[00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:19.600]   you need to make sure you're really doing a lot of self-care
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:20.760]   more than the average person
[00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:23.840]   because of this outsized responsibility you have.
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:26.240]   This is what I think about parenting.
[00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:28.320]   And it's why from, you know,
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:31.240]   the bigger theme here is this is what gets me out of bed,
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:33.120]   you know, every morning so motivated
[00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:36.400]   is not just to help parents understand tantrums or emotions
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:38.760]   or, you know, the latest struggle in their house.
[00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:40.760]   Although I actually love that.
[00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:41.600]   It's to say, "Hold on.
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:44.920]   Like, we've been really sold an awful story
[00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:46.640]   about what it really means to be a parent
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:50.360]   and how parenting really, first and foremost,
[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:52.200]   is a journey of self-care.
[00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:54.520]   How can I be the sturdiest person possible?
[00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:58.320]   Who do I need in my life when things go poorly
[00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:01.600]   so I don't lean on my young children
[00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:05.360]   and give them a responsibility that is not theirs?"
[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:07.400]   You know, I was just saying to someone the other day
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:09.320]   that when you have kids,
[00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:12.800]   all of the unhealed parts of your childhood
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:15.440]   come right before your eyes.
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:18.320]   They are just triggered over and over and over
[00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:19.640]   with your own children.
[00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:21.520]   Like, you know, "Oh, my kid's whining.
[00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:22.640]   I can't deal with that."
[00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:25.480]   Oh, well, whining is probably triggering
[00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:28.440]   'cause it's kind of representative of helplessness.
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:30.640]   What was it like in my family if I kind of felt helpless?
[00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:31.480]   Was that allowed?
[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:33.880]   Did I grow up in a, you know,
[00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:34.800]   "If you don't stop crying,
[00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:36.880]   I'll give you something to cry about," family?
[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:38.800]   Okay, if I don't resolve that,
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:41.800]   I'm going to act that all out on my children
[00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:43.400]   and pass that along.
[00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:47.560]   So all of kind of these situations
[00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:49.840]   where parents are feeling all these different emotions
[00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:52.520]   from a trigger, from something in their life,
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:54.520]   I think it goes to what I always tell parents.
[00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:58.840]   You know, you have a first and foremost job
[00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:01.200]   of self-care and taking care of yourself.
[00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:03.160]   That doesn't mean traveling to Europe for the year
[00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:04.480]   and leaving your kids alone.
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:06.640]   It means what is going on inside you.
[00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:07.920]   What skills do you need?
[00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:10.280]   What networks of support do you need?
[00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:12.600]   What do you have around you to help you
[00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:14.240]   on the hardest journey of your life
[00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:17.240]   and the most rewarding one of being a parent
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:20.000]   so that you don't have to say to your kids,
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.360]   you know, "Oh, you know, can you kind of take care of me?"
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:27.000]   - Paul Conti, who came on this podcast
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.600]   to do a series about mental health,
[00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:32.680]   not just mental challenges, but also mental health,
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:35.120]   which is an interesting concept in its own right,
[00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:38.440]   has been quoted as saying that, you know,
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:41.400]   that if you were to list out the 100 most important things
[00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:43.320]   for romantic relationships,
[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:48.400]   it would be self-care and communication repeated 50 times.
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:50.160]   And I'm thinking about that now
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:52.120]   because it sounds like a pretty good model
[00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:54.240]   for pretty much every relationship.
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:55.080]   - Yes.
[00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:56.120]   - Self-care, communication.
[00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:57.920]   And I must say, the first time I heard him say that,
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:01.520]   it wasn't on my podcast, it was on a different podcast,
[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:02.360]   sort of surprised.
[00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:04.360]   I thought, self-care first?
[00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:06.600]   But the way you're framing it,
[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:09.320]   it seems to me that if self-care comes first,
[00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:12.800]   or at least very high on the list of what parents should do,
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:16.240]   it frees up the kids to live and experience life
[00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:18.400]   with a lot more ease.
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:19.240]   - Yeah.
[00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:20.200]   - A lot more peace.
[00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:21.040]   - Yeah.
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:25.480]   - And to basically unburden them of about 50,000 jobs.
[00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:26.320]   - That's exactly right.
[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:31.160]   And I think self-care has gotten, you know, misrepresented.
[00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:33.080]   It doesn't mean getting a manicure every week.
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:34.920]   It could, if that does it for you.
[00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:36.000]   But when I think about self-care,
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.920]   and I really think about the work we do with parents
[00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:40.480]   at Good Inside, we always say Good Inside,
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:43.040]   and like our app, it's not parenting.
[00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:44.280]   It's for parents.
[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:46.440]   It's for the journey of what it means to be a parent.
[00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:47.400]   It's for your own stuff.
[00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:48.840]   It's for your triggers.
[00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:51.360]   It's for finally learning how to set boundaries.
[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:53.440]   It's about finally learning
[00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:55.280]   that it's okay to get your needs met,
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:57.240]   even when they inconvenience others.
[00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:00.080]   It's learning that your relationships are strong enough,
[00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:02.840]   that they can get through hard moments
[00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:05.040]   where people are upset with you, right?
[00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:07.760]   It's about finally saying to,
[00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:09.240]   if you need to, your mother-in-law,
[00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:11.400]   we can't have any visitors on Saturday.
[00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:13.400]   And the reason I'm finally able to do that
[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:15.480]   is 'cause I understand my self-value
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:17.400]   and all this stuff that has nothing to do
[00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:19.680]   with the fact that your kid isn't sleeping at night.
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:23.160]   But that is the foundation for intervening
[00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:24.520]   in the way you're proud of
[00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:26.880]   when your kid is waking you up at two in the morning.
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:28.360]   Right, so that is the self-care.
[00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:30.400]   It's really like a, not just self-care,
[00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:32.000]   it's self-establishment.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.720]   It's self-growth, really.
[00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:37.280]   - I don't know the psychology literature
[00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:38.840]   or clinical literature around this,
[00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:43.400]   but I'm thinking about speed of emotional shifts.
[00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:46.120]   In my own experience of life,
[00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:48.600]   I've known moody people,
[00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:52.600]   and I've known not as moody people.
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:56.120]   I define moody as people whose moods fluctuate quickly
[00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:57.920]   and sometimes spontaneously.
[00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:01.760]   But this idea that some people are steady as a rock
[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:03.680]   is a great concept,
[00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:06.120]   but we also know that we need to feel our emotions,
[00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:08.160]   express them to some extent.
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:11.040]   And yet there are people where if we were to plot this,
[00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:12.800]   it would look like a high-frequency wave
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:14.160]   where some people are really upset,
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:15.240]   then they're feeling better again.
[00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:16.480]   They're upset, then they're feeling better again.
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:18.640]   I'm not talking about extreme pathology here.
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:22.160]   I'm talking about someone cuts them off in traffic
[00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:24.280]   and they're pissed, but then they're fine.
[00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:26.320]   They're very, very happy about something they see,
[00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:28.080]   so it doesn't always have to be negative.
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:29.560]   But then they're kind of like flat affect,
[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:31.320]   and then they're into something negative.
[00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:34.960]   I think that experience of emotions
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:36.760]   is so far and away different
[00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:40.120]   from the experience of emotions emitted from somebody
[00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:43.240]   who you can kind of see the emotion coming.
[00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:44.680]   It's like a slow swell.
[00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:48.640]   It's like a expansion and then a contraction again
[00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:50.560]   that you have time.
[00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:51.800]   And I feel like I keep coming back
[00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:53.480]   to this theme of time perception,
[00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:55.000]   but anytime we have time
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.200]   or we hear about like in all the Buddhist traditions,
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:59.800]   like space, like you're trying to create mental space
[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:02.240]   and this gap between stimulus and response,
[00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:04.560]   it all sounds great, but with some people,
[00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:06.320]   you have to really be on your toes
[00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:09.200]   or perhaps you disengage.
[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:11.960]   And so I've never heard a satisfying answer to this,
[00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:14.240]   probably 'cause I've never asked it out loud.
[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:17.840]   If you're a kid or if you're a parent
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:20.320]   and somebody is experiencing something,
[00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:22.680]   let's say they're really angry or really happy,
[00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:26.760]   you can imagine riding that wave in with them.
[00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:28.760]   You could also imagine sitting back from it.
[00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:31.400]   And some of this is probably what we'd call temperament,
[00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:34.360]   but maybe you could talk about this a little bit
[00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:36.200]   in the context of having one or both parents
[00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:38.800]   that's kind of like a high frequency shifts
[00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:41.560]   between emotions versus kind of a slow expansion
[00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:44.240]   and then settling of emotions.
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:46.960]   'Cause I feel like those are two completely different
[00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:48.320]   experiences of life.
[00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:49.240]   - Yeah.
[00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:52.240]   I mean, I think you're speaking to how differently
[00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:53.400]   we feel emotions.
[00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:55.480]   I mean, I think about one of my kids
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:57.960]   who I call a deeply feeling kid, right?
[00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:01.400]   So my image is always, she's just more porous to the world.
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:04.040]   And so if you think about someone who's more porous,
[00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:06.280]   that their pores are literally wider,
[00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:08.320]   a lot more is gonna come in.
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:09.400]   And guess what?
[00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:11.640]   A lot more is gonna come out, right?
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:15.520]   And she's a kid who, by the way,
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:17.520]   you're in a certain area in New York City.
[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:19.760]   She's like, "I can't be here, the smell."
[00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:22.120]   For me, I'm wired differently.
[00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:24.400]   I was like, "I literally don't smell anything different."
[00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:25.840]   Now, does that mean she's wrong?
[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:29.320]   No, I actually bet knowing her, she smells things.
[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:31.400]   And then she lets me know how awful it is
[00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:33.120]   and she can't stand on that corner.
[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:35.000]   And for me, in that moment, at least,
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.640]   'cause we're probably all volatile in different ways,
[00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:40.400]   I look steady as a rock, right?
[00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:44.600]   I have another kid who, yeah, is pretty steady
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:49.080]   until he feels like his authority and power is threatened
[00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:51.720]   and then he better watch out, you know?
[00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:54.080]   And so in one moment, someone might see him as,
[00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:55.600]   "Oh, wow, that kid's really volatile."
[00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:58.840]   But in probably 90% of other moments,
[00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:00.680]   he's kind of cool as a cucumber.
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:03.800]   So I also think it's important to categorize kids
[00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:06.200]   not as always one way or another,
[00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:08.600]   but we all feel emotions differently.
[00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:10.240]   None of them is wrong or right.
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:15.240]   To me, the goal is to not be locked into any one thing.
[00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:19.760]   That, to me, rigidity is always the enemy.
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:21.760]   That's what holds us back in adulthood.
[00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:23.640]   If we're always one way.
[00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:26.520]   I can never handle someone cutting me off in traffic
[00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:28.800]   because the emotion takes me over and I have road rage.
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:29.640]   Yeah, that's not good.
[00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:32.320]   That's a very rigid, limited way of living life.
[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:34.760]   But it's probably also limiting to say,
[00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:36.760]   "I've never really gotten riled up about anything."
[00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:37.600]   Forget road rage,
[00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:40.120]   but it's kind of amazing to get riled up once in a while
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:42.000]   and to feel really passionately about something
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.320]   and to feel something enough
[00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:45.520]   that you wanna go do something about it, right?
[00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:47.800]   So there's no morality on it.
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:48.800]   I think what's tricky,
[00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:51.720]   I can even say as a parent of three kids,
[00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:54.840]   is each of my kids, I always kind of imagine this,
[00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:56.760]   if I have all these different parts of me,
[00:30:56.760 --> 00:31:01.040]   they each need a different part of me to kind of lead.
[00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:04.240]   Like they almost need different lead parents, right?
[00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:07.200]   So my kid who is my deeply feeling kid,
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:10.960]   I know what's so important is that I believe her experience
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:13.040]   and I better be ready with certain boundaries
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:15.600]   because she feels things so intensely,
[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:16.600]   especially when she was younger.
[00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:17.560]   I have to step in more often.
[00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:19.880]   There's more difficult behavior, right?
[00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:22.960]   My kid who's really, really steady,
[00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:25.800]   I try to sometimes, even though it's convenient
[00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:27.200]   'cause he's so easy,
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:28.760]   there's definitely a lot going on in there.
[00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:30.840]   And sometimes I wonder,
[00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:32.840]   does he almost feel like all the emotional space
[00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:35.240]   is taken up by his siblings
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:38.280]   and the only thing left for him is kind of steady as a rock?
[00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:40.720]   And that can lead to rigidity later in life, right?
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:43.320]   So I think these are like moving systems.
[00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:47.560]   So much of how we experience emotions growing up
[00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:49.560]   is also dictated by the system
[00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:52.120]   and kind of the roles our siblings play.
[00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:56.160]   - And so I don't know if that kind of gives you
[00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:58.160]   enough of an answer, but I think-
[00:31:58.160 --> 00:31:59.440]   - That's informative.
[00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:01.280]   - Yeah, I think the thing I'd really want parents to know
[00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:03.120]   is I think we place a lot of morality on it.
[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:04.400]   And if we're honest with ourselves,
[00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:07.040]   we're probably just comparing our kid to how we do things.
[00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:09.360]   So if you're someone who's pretty steady,
[00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:10.640]   you're like, my kid is crazy.
[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:12.000]   They're dramatic, right?
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.920]   If you're someone who's a little more out there,
[00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:15.600]   you're not as bothered by that kid.
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:16.440]   And then you have another kid,
[00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:18.040]   you're like, that kid's kind of boring, right?
[00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:19.160]   'Cause they're so flat.
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:21.640]   And so, I mean, I think this is true in couples too.
[00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:23.160]   Whenever we're fighting, we're probably just saying,
[00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:24.520]   why can't you be more like me?
[00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:25.880]   When we're triggered by our kid, we're like,
[00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:27.480]   why can't you be more like me, right?
[00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:29.160]   That's probably what we're always saying to each other,
[00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:30.800]   going back to communication.
[00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:33.480]   But if you take a little different perspective of,
[00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:34.320]   hold on a second,
[00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:37.480]   there's no wrong or right way to feel emotions.
[00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:39.280]   Some behaviors are not allowed,
[00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:41.680]   but all the emotions have information.
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:45.800]   And what might my kid need right now instead of,
[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:47.560]   oh my goodness, is my kid messed up?
[00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:50.560]   Or why is my kid not just a little bit more like me?
[00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:54.280]   - How useful is it to talk to kids about emotions
[00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:56.200]   when they're not happening?
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:58.520]   - I mean, to me, this is something like,
[00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:01.680]   I always just say, I always phrase it as emotion talk, right?
[00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:06.680]   Just knowing that emotions live within you,
[00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:08.920]   knowing that there's names for them,
[00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:12.120]   that they're normal, that they make sense.
[00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:14.880]   To me, it's like the ultimate leg up in life.
[00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:17.840]   It's like, it gives your kids such resilience
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:21.720]   because we can't beat our emotions.
[00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:24.280]   I feel like we've been trying that for generations.
[00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:26.640]   Like if I just only didn't feel so angry
[00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:29.440]   or so jealous or so sad,
[00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:32.080]   our emotions are so primal in our body.
[00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:35.400]   And I really do believe emotions, they're information.
[00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:37.160]   That's what they are.
[00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:40.480]   Why would we ever want to not get the information
[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:42.240]   our body is giving us?
[00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:44.680]   And sometimes it's almost dramatic what happens
[00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:46.000]   in an amazing way.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:47.800]   So many people, I think about so many times
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:50.600]   I have people in a room for therapy, they start crying.
[00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:51.440]   I'm so sorry.
[00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:55.040]   You're feeling something so intensely
[00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:58.120]   that your body is producing water from your eyes
[00:33:58.120 --> 00:33:59.160]   to get your attention.
[00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:03.080]   Like that must be really important information.
[00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:04.440]   Why are we saying sorry?
[00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:07.800]   - And as far as we know, a uniquely human thing,
[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:09.000]   I could be wrong about this,
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.200]   but a colleague of mine at Stanford and psychiatrist
[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:15.440]   Karl Deisseroth talked about this,
[00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:20.280]   that humans are the only species that we are aware of
[00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:23.320]   that sheds tears for sake of emotion.
[00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:24.160]   - Yeah.
[00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:25.760]   - Other animals, they have lacrimal glands,
[00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:28.720]   they produce water, so to speak, salty water
[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:30.680]   that comes out of their eye region,
[00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:32.960]   but not as it relates to emotions.
[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:34.600]   At least we don't think so.
[00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:36.120]   - So that's a great example.
[00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:37.360]   Like I even think about a conversation
[00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:38.520]   I have had with my kids,
[00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:41.080]   and I like to just have these moments here and there.
[00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:43.120]   Whenever I talk about good conversations with my kids,
[00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:45.440]   I think people think I have these 45 minute,
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:47.280]   no, they're usually 10 seconds.
[00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:49.680]   I say one thing, my kids say, "Can I have a snack now?"
[00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:51.080]   And I think that's a great conversation
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:52.560]   'cause I know it gets in there.
[00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:57.400]   Do you know that tears have really important information
[00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:58.240]   for us?
[00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:00.040]   I can be like, "What, what'd you say?"
[00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:02.160]   I'm just thinking, so many people think tears are bad.
[00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:03.480]   Tears are kind of amazing.
[00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:05.280]   It's like our body is trying to stop us,
[00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:07.880]   and it's like asking us to pay attention
[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:10.120]   to something really powerful.
[00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:13.520]   I just think it's kind of an amazing thing our body does.
[00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:15.440]   And my kid goes, "Can I have pretzels?"
[00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:17.240]   "Oh, sure, I'll get you pretzels."
[00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:18.240]   That to me is a win.
[00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:20.960]   I just want to tell everyone, that is a 10 out of 10.
[00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:22.720]   I'm bragging to people about that.
[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:25.600]   I'm like, "I had the best conversation."
[00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:29.920]   Because I know this is seeping in.
[00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:32.960]   Because in the moment my kid is crying,
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:34.120]   you think it's going to be helpful
[00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:35.720]   when my seven-year-old is crying,
[00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:37.200]   "Tears are amazing."
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:39.000]   Or like, "F you, Mom."
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.080]   No one wants to hear that.
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:42.600]   - My reflex would be to tell them the biology of tears.
[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:44.120]   Noma Sobel, who was on the podcast,
[00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:45.560]   told us that tears contain hormones
[00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:48.080]   that signal to other people, pheromones, excuse me,
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:50.800]   that literally change the biology of the people around you.
[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:52.320]   We can actually smell tears.
[00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:53.640]   We don't realize we're doing it.
[00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:54.480]   See, here I go.
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:57.240]   So I realize I spend enough time with kids
[00:35:57.240 --> 00:36:00.120]   that if you tell them that, they're like, "Whatever."
[00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:02.360]   - But you know when that's a great conversation?
[00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:03.200]   Around the dinner table.
[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:04.960]   And again, your kids will roll their eyes.
[00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:06.040]   Kids roll their eyes about everything.
[00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:08.240]   I always think rolling their eyes or stop
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:10.400]   is kind of a kid's way of saying,
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:12.920]   "There's a lot coming at me on my own person.
[00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:15.440]   "I just need to push it away a little
[00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:19.280]   "so that on my own time and under my own control,
[00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:20.480]   "I can take it in."
[00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:23.000]   And we take eye rolls or whatever it is so personally
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.360]   that then we end up getting into a power struggle,
[00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:25.480]   "Why are you rolling my eyes?"
[00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:27.000]   And we miss this opportunity.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.080]   If we just say nothing then,
[00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:29.760]   our kid is going to take in what we just said.
[00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:30.800]   Just walk away.
[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:32.400]   Let the whole process happen.
[00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:34.360]   You know, it's kind of like if your boss comes in
[00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:35.840]   and says something like,
[00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:38.320]   "Oh, look, that project really wasn't as good as it,
[00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:39.160]   "you know, could have been.
[00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:41.000]   "And I really need these things done."
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.560]   And you're like, "Oh."
[00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:44.240]   And then imagine, "You're rolling your eyes at me?"
[00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:46.200]   If your boss just leaves the room,
[00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:47.760]   you probably think,
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:50.680]   "Oh, I didn't do that as well as I could.
[00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:51.760]   "I'm going to go work on it."
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:52.600]   Right?
[00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:54.520]   So I feel like not taking the bait
[00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:56.400]   is a very important parenting tool.
[00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:58.120]   But I think those moments with our kids
[00:36:58.120 --> 00:37:02.200]   to talk about emotions and to talk about our own,
[00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:05.160]   especially when it comes to struggle, right?
[00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:07.800]   One of the things I think a lot about,
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:09.680]   I try to be intentional with my kids,
[00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:10.680]   especially when they're younger.
[00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:15.680]   I just think kids are flooded by their parents' capability.
[00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:19.960]   And it is so hard to learn in environments
[00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:24.960]   where someone's capability is so far beyond your own.
[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:26.360]   Like, I'm not a good cook,
[00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:29.680]   but if I was really learning to cook,
[00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:31.960]   I would want to learn from someone from here or there,
[00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:35.440]   you know, burn some garlic or messed up the broccoli.
[00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:36.280]   And then it was like,
[00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:38.040]   "Okay, well, I guess I could do this next time."
[00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:39.000]   I'd be like, "Okay."
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.360]   But if I'm learning to cook
[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:44.880]   from someone who is whatever celebrity chef,
[00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:45.720]   I don't get it.
[00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:47.560]   Like, that person's like way too far from me.
[00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:49.440]   And I almost feel shame.
[00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:50.920]   So I think about this with our kids
[00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:52.400]   and how this relates to emotions,
[00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:54.160]   where when your kids are younger,
[00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:55.200]   especially if you just think about
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:57.520]   the first 10 minutes of their day,
[00:37:57.520 --> 00:37:58.520]   like they're trying to figure out
[00:37:58.520 --> 00:37:59.560]   maybe how to brush their teeth,
[00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:00.520]   how to go to the bathroom,
[00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:01.440]   how to turn on the sink,
[00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:02.320]   how to wash their hands.
[00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:04.440]   They always put their shirt on the wrong way.
[00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:05.680]   They can't get on their socks.
[00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:06.640]   There's so many things.
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:08.880]   And you come out, dress perfectly.
[00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:10.320]   And then they're like, "I can't get on my socks."
[00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:11.160]   And you go like this.
[00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:12.200]   Okay, one, two.
[00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:14.320]   And kind of in those moments,
[00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:16.440]   I always think that I'm just kind of saying to my kid,
[00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:17.680]   "I can do everything easily."
[00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:19.720]   And they don't know our history.
[00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:21.160]   They don't know.
[00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:23.680]   We struggled to put on socks for five years too.
[00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:26.040]   I put on my shirt backward, you know, until college.
[00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:27.280]   They don't know that.
[00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:29.600]   And so I think again, in these calm moments,
[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:33.320]   you have this opportunity to say something like,
[00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:37.240]   "I cannot finish this crossword puzzle."
[00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:39.560]   Or like, I love New York Times games, right?
[00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:42.360]   And it's so fun with my kids now that they're older,
[00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:44.720]   but my connections was really hard today.
[00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:46.240]   I just, I really struggled with it.
[00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:47.600]   And then I was like, "Oh, I can't do it.
[00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:48.440]   I can't do it."
[00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:51.880]   And then I took a deep breath and I tried it a little more.
[00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:53.760]   And, you know, maybe I said, "And I did it."
[00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:54.600]   Or, "I didn't do it."
[00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:56.000]   Whatever it is.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.400]   And it gives my kid, first of all,
[00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:59.720]   it gives my kid an opportunity to just notice
[00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:01.160]   that I struggled too.
[00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:04.600]   It gives my kid, again, kind of an arc and a story of,
[00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:06.800]   "Oh, someone I admire so much."
[00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:08.600]   Every kid admires their parents.
[00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:09.720]   They've had hard times.
[00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:11.200]   They still have hard times.
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:12.280]   They work through things.
[00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:13.320]   They burn garlic.
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:16.480]   They can kind of talk themselves through it.
[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:19.760]   That is such a more powerful kind of lesson
[00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:21.360]   in emotion regulation
[00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:25.560]   than teaching your kid kind of directly.
[00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:28.360]   - It also seems that here,
[00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:29.880]   we're not defining the age of the kids,
[00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:33.480]   but that if one presents themselves as perfect
[00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:35.640]   or close to it in any kind of relationship,
[00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:39.200]   work, romantic, parenting, et cetera,
[00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:42.200]   sooner or later, you're going to fall from grace
[00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:45.480]   because they're either going to be looking for the mistake
[00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:46.480]   or the moment you make a mistake,
[00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:48.280]   it's going to be this fracture in the picture
[00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:50.320]   that people had of you.
[00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:52.520]   And I have to say,
[00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:54.560]   and I think some people might get irritated
[00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:57.240]   or even dare I say triggered
[00:39:57.240 --> 00:39:58.800]   by the language I'm about to use,
[00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:03.800]   but I feel like the real like ninja move in all of this
[00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:07.600]   is to acknowledge that there are power dynamics
[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:08.800]   between parent and child,
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:11.520]   but then to try and dissolve the power dynamics.
[00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:12.720]   And I say this in the context
[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:14.080]   of having run a lab for a long time,
[00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:15.920]   which is very different than raising small children,
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:18.520]   but you have people who are coming into your laboratory,
[00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:21.360]   they are, if they're your graduate student or postdoc,
[00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:22.800]   they're staking their whole career
[00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:25.560]   on your ability to teach and mentor.
[00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:26.720]   And a lot is at stake.
[00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:27.760]   Nothing is for certain.
[00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:28.800]   They might not get a job,
[00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:30.880]   their papers might not work out,
[00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:33.760]   and so there's just so much tension around it.
[00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:37.480]   And so as a PI, as a principal investigator in our lab,
[00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:39.320]   I remember feeling that pressure of like,
[00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:40.760]   it's got to work out.
[00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:43.960]   And one of the best things that ever happened to me
[00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:45.920]   as a graduate student was that my first paper
[00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:48.400]   took forever to get accepted.
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:50.440]   And we almost got in and then I didn't get in,
[00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:51.640]   and then finally it got in,
[00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:55.040]   such that every paper after that felt like a breeze
[00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:57.240]   because it took so damn long the first time.
[00:40:57.240 --> 00:40:58.960]   And I got to see that my advisor
[00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:02.640]   couldn't like make magic happen.
[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:05.160]   And fortunately, that's the way the scientific process
[00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:06.240]   is supposed to work.
[00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:08.280]   And I think about this in the context of parenting,
[00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:11.120]   like if you're seen as invincible,
[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:11.960]   you know, we hear about this,
[00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:14.280]   like people say, I thought my dad was Superman.
[00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:16.880]   I thought my mom was Superwoman, you know,
[00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:20.480]   and then, but you can imagine how disappointing it must be
[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:23.680]   when they discover anything about a lack of capacity
[00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:27.440]   or a break in emotional stability, et cetera.
[00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:29.360]   So how does one present themselves
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:33.200]   as both powerful in the positive sense of the word,
[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:34.840]   such a thorny word,
[00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:36.840]   but powerful in the positive sense of the word,
[00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:40.680]   but human and vulnerable to making mistakes
[00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:44.600]   in a way that you don't give up the essential,
[00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:45.880]   let's just call it what it is,
[00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:47.120]   a power dynamic with your kids
[00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:49.480]   so that the kid then doesn't feel they have to parent you.
[00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:51.800]   - I love this topic because it's so interesting.
[00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:54.840]   Right now, it's kind of review season at Good Inside
[00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:56.840]   'cause I also am the CEO of a company.
[00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:59.840]   And to me, the things I talk about with parenting
[00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:03.440]   and my kids, and for other people parenting their kids,
[00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:08.240]   they are the exact same principles, exact as leading a team.
[00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:10.560]   And so when I think about review season
[00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:12.640]   and the way we get feedback and the, right,
[00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:15.640]   and back and forth, it brings us all together
[00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:16.480]   and I'll explain.
[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:19.280]   The other day, I said to my kids,
[00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:21.720]   I love resolutions.
[00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:23.640]   I actually do love resolutions, right?
[00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:26.080]   'Cause I love just the opportunity to say,
[00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:27.720]   what is one small thing?
[00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:29.600]   I'm like, I value,
[00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:31.920]   and I'm gonna hold myself accountable to do.
[00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:34.080]   What I said to my kids was,
[00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:36.960]   I want you to come up with one thing,
[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:38.280]   just one thing for now.
[00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:41.760]   And it has to be something like manageable and real
[00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:45.480]   that I could do that would really make me a better mom to you
[00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:47.320]   - You asked your kids this.
[00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:48.160]   - I asked my kids this.
[00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:50.560]   I actually asked my kids this relatively frequently.
[00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:52.160]   It's like a review, right?
[00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:54.600]   Because it's something I do at work all the time.
[00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:56.120]   And what I say at work is,
[00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:58.600]   'cause often my direct reports say nothing.
[00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:00.800]   I said, I just wanna tell you something.
[00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:03.480]   I need one thing from you by the end of the day.
[00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:05.560]   I need it.
[00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:09.000]   Because like, I know, I know I can get hot.
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.080]   I know I can get a little reactive, right?
[00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:13.880]   I know I'm always go, go, go.
[00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:15.680]   And there probably is a moment that, you know,
[00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:16.680]   I need to pause.
[00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:18.840]   I know, I know I have a lot of issues.
[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:20.520]   So if you don't tell me one thing,
[00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:22.440]   I don't trust you as much.
[00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:23.640]   So here's what happened with my kids.
[00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:25.080]   At that point, it was only two of them.
[00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:26.560]   It just happened the other day.
[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:29.500]   My son says, my seven-year-old son,
[00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:34.080]   sometimes when you're trying to get some work done at home,
[00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:35.920]   and I wanna get your attention for something,
[00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:37.920]   this is what you do, mom.
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:41.040]   One minute, one minute, one minute,
[00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:42.680]   and then you still don't give me attention.
[00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:44.560]   - He's clocking, he's clocking.
[00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:47.800]   - I'd rather you tell me five minutes
[00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:49.800]   and then give me your full attention.
[00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:53.360]   That's literally what, and I was just like,
[00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:55.720]   that is a really good suggestion.
[00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:57.360]   And I really needed to hear that.
[00:43:57.360 --> 00:43:59.400]   I can do that.
[00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:01.840]   This was a couple of days ago.
[00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:05.400]   Okay, I have to admit, two days ago,
[00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:08.920]   he was trying to show me something.
[00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:11.120]   And he just goes, you're doing it.
[00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:13.480]   You're not really giving me your attention.
[00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:14.920]   And I said, you're right.
[00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:15.920]   Thank you.
[00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:17.320]   Change is hard.
[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:20.080]   I actually do need about two minutes.
[00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:20.920]   Is that okay?
[00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:22.480]   And then I'll put my computer down
[00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:23.400]   'cause I'll sometimes look at him
[00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:24.600]   and like kind of look at, you know?
[00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:25.720]   And he goes, okay.
[00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:27.720]   It was kind of, it was so beautiful.
[00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:32.040]   My daughter said, at night, she goes,
[00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:33.960]   it's so interesting when you give people this opportunity,
[00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:36.000]   how generous they can be with you.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:37.560]   I think it's been true at work and home.
[00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:40.520]   My daughter goes, I know when it's my bedtime at night,
[00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:42.400]   I always want to do one or two extra things.
[00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:43.320]   I know.
[00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:44.920]   I always have to get my water.
[00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:46.360]   Mom, it's just how I am.
[00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:47.640]   That's what she said.
[00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:51.280]   And you get this rushing voice and you go, come on,
[00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:52.200]   it's bedtime.
[00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:56.440]   And that's like the last voice I hear before bed.
[00:44:56.440 --> 00:44:58.520]   And I really don't like that voice.
[00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:01.120]   And so can you just know that I always need to do those one
[00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:03.560]   or two extra things and not use that voice?
[00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:07.800]   And again, I said, you know what?
[00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:10.240]   I wouldn't want to hear that as the last voice.
[00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:11.600]   You know, and I think at night, especially,
[00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:13.200]   it's a little digression.
[00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:16.080]   I always feel like I'm in a rush.
[00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:18.520]   I don't know, an extra two minutes with my kids.
[00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:19.640]   Like, my kids are getting older.
[00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:21.640]   They're not even in my house for that much longer.
[00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:23.640]   I just have to remind myself, I'm not in a rush.
[00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:25.160]   Like, this is the best use of my time.
[00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:27.880]   So I said, and that one I've been really good at.
[00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:32.360]   And so how do we show our kids that we're fallible?
[00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:36.640]   One way is actually like asking for feedback,
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:38.320]   especially when you have older kids.
[00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:42.160]   When you have a teenager, this is the number one thing
[00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:43.720]   that can change things around.
[00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:45.720]   You know what I'm thinking about?
[00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:47.440]   It's hard to be a teen.
[00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:51.080]   And I'm definitely not a perfect parent of a teen.
[00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:53.480]   I'm sure you have a long list.
[00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:58.240]   But for right now, can you name one thing that I could do
[00:45:58.240 --> 00:46:00.080]   that would make me a better parent to you?
[00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:01.040]   And I want to follow this through,
[00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:02.080]   'cause what a lot of teens will do,
[00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:03.120]   or parents will say,
[00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:06.960]   my teenager tells me something ridiculous.
[00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:09.680]   They'll say, well, you know how you make me
[00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:12.800]   charge my phone at nine or 10 p.m. out of the room?
[00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:14.200]   You could let me sleep with my phone,
[00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:15.880]   which may be apparent, like, I'm just not gonna do that.
[00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:17.600]   Or they'll say, you know what you could do?
[00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:20.840]   You could give me $1,000 every week for an allowance, right?
[00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:23.200]   And so parents will say, my kid doesn't take it seriously.
[00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:24.400]   This is where, like to me,
[00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:26.480]   one of the most important life skills,
[00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:29.520]   parenting, management, friendships, it doesn't matter,
[00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:33.640]   is differentiating someone's words on the surface
[00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:37.080]   from their needs or their feelings or their fears,
[00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:39.120]   whatever it is, underneath,
[00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:41.280]   and not responding to the words,
[00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:43.280]   but kind of cutting under them.
[00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:45.680]   Let's even say I can said the phone thing.
[00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:49.400]   What would be so great about having your phone?
[00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:50.600]   Just help me understand it.
[00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:52.120]   I know in my head I'm never gonna do it,
[00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:54.040]   but we don't realize,
[00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:56.120]   just 'cause we're not gonna do something someone asks,
[00:46:56.120 --> 00:46:58.400]   it doesn't mean we don't owe that person the right
[00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:01.280]   to try to understand why they want it, right?
[00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:02.440]   So I might just ask questions.
[00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:03.640]   I might probably end with, look,
[00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:04.720]   I actually hear what you're saying.
[00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:07.800]   All of your friends are on Instagram until midnight.
[00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:09.880]   It sounds like you legitimately do miss out
[00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:11.680]   on conversations by the time you get to school.
[00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:12.600]   You feel out of them.
[00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:14.240]   Like, I'm not even joking.
[00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:15.280]   I feel like if I was your age,
[00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:17.000]   I'd be like, that's like basically the worst thing ever.
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:17.840]   I believe you.
[00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:20.520]   Having your phone after X time,
[00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:22.600]   it's just one of my non-negotiables.
[00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:24.400]   It's actually just 'cause I love you so much
[00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:26.720]   that I feel like my job is to protect you.
[00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:28.240]   I wonder if there is some other way
[00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:29.440]   that we can figure that out.
[00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:31.600]   Or my kid says $1,000, I might say,
[00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:33.080]   what would you do with $1,000?
[00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:34.720]   Oh, you'd go, oh, you wanna go to more concerts.
[00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:36.120]   Oh, your friends all get more allowance.
[00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:36.960]   Tell me more.
[00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:39.480]   No matter what your kid says to you, there's information.
[00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:42.200]   So I think feedback is one.
[00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:45.000]   I think repair is another way.
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   Repair is the most important relationship strategy
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:49.400]   to get good at.
[00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:52.360]   And I just hope everyone hears the duality in that
[00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:53.880]   and realizes what that means,
[00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:57.280]   because if you're gonna get good at repair,
[00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:59.000]   you have to mess up.
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:02.160]   The only way to repair is to mess up.
[00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:05.040]   And so if I'm telling you, get good at repair,
[00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:07.960]   I am telling you, you have to accomplish step one,
[00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:09.800]   which is yelling at your kid.
[00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:11.640]   You have to, and you're gonna do it anyway.
[00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:12.680]   I do it.
[00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:14.440]   But if you then tell yourself, wait,
[00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:15.760]   I'm getting good at repair.
[00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:17.680]   Step one is messing up.
[00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:18.520]   I crushed it.
[00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:20.000]   Amazing, I'm half the way there.
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.720]   Then when you repair, which is when you take ownership,
[00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:26.760]   hey, I'm sorry I yelled, just like you.
[00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:28.120]   I'm managing my emotions.
[00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:29.880]   Emotions are really tricky.
[00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:31.400]   Emotions are really hard.
[00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:32.960]   And do you know what?
[00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:34.880]   Even though you're gonna have a leg up on this
[00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:36.600]   compared to most people when they're adults,
[00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:38.600]   'cause you're learning how to regulate emotions,
[00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:41.560]   you're still gonna be practicing that when you're my age.
[00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:43.840]   That is my responsibility to work on.
[00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:45.480]   It's not your fault.
[00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:46.920]   And I love you.
[00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:48.000]   So powerful.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.600]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:53.240]   and acknowledge our sponsor, AG1.
[00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:55.840]   AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:58.960]   that also includes prebiotics and adaptogens.
[00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:00.400]   AG1 is designed to cover
[00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:02.480]   all of your foundational nutritional needs,
[00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:03.640]   and it tastes great.
[00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:06.400]   Now, I've been drinking AG1 since 2012.
[00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:07.800]   And I started doing that at a time
[00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:10.320]   when my budget for supplements was really limited.
[00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:12.160]   In fact, I only had enough money back then
[00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:13.480]   to purchase one supplement.
[00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:16.520]   And I'm so glad that I made that supplement AG1.
[00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:18.960]   The reason for that is even though I strive to eat
[00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:20.640]   most of my foods from whole foods
[00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:22.440]   and minimally processed foods,
[00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:24.440]   it's very difficult for me to get enough fruits,
[00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:26.200]   vegetables, vitamins, and minerals,
[00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:29.360]   micronutrients, and adaptogens from food alone.
[00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:31.280]   And I need to do that in order to ensure
[00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:33.080]   that I have enough energy throughout the day,
[00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:36.520]   I sleep well at night, and keep my immune system strong.
[00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:38.040]   But when I take AG1 daily,
[00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:39.680]   I find that all aspects of my health,
[00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:42.280]   my physical health, my mental health, and my performance,
[00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:44.480]   both cognitive and physical, are better.
[00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:46.060]   I know that because I've had lapses
[00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:49.160]   when I didn't take AG1, and I certainly felt the difference.
[00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:51.180]   I also noticed, and this makes perfect sense
[00:49:51.180 --> 00:49:53.240]   given the relationship between the gut microbiome
[00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:55.760]   and the brain, that when I regularly take AG1,
[00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:58.160]   which for me means a serving in the morning or mid-morning,
[00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:00.320]   and again, later in the afternoon or evening,
[00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:03.420]   that I have more mental clarity and more mental energy.
[00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:04.920]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:08.280]   you can go to drinkag1.com/huberman

[00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:17.720]   and a year supply of vitamin D3 K2.
[00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:21.000]   Again, go to drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:22.560]   to claim the 10 free travel packs
[00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:25.200]   and a year supply of vitamin D3 K2.
[00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:28.160]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Juve.
[00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:31.160]   Juve makes medical-grade red light therapy devices.
[00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:32.000]   Now, if there's one thing
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:34.560]   that I have consistently emphasized on this podcast,
[00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:36.880]   it's the incredible impact that light can have
[00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:38.200]   on our biology.
[00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:39.560]   Now, in addition to sunlight,
[00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:41.200]   red light and near-infrared light
[00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:42.960]   have been shown to have positive effects
[00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:45.920]   on improving numerous aspects of cellular and organ health,
[00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:47.640]   including faster muscle recovery,
[00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:49.700]   improved skin health and wound healing,
[00:50:49.700 --> 00:50:52.480]   improvements in acne, meaning reductions in acne,
[00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:53.900]   reduced pain and inflammation,
[00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:55.240]   improved mitochondrial function,
[00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:57.880]   and even improving visual function itself.
[00:50:57.880 --> 00:50:59.200]   What sets Juve lights apart
[00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:01.400]   and why they're my preferred red light therapy device
[00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:03.620]   is that they use clinically proven wavelengths,
[00:51:03.620 --> 00:51:05.960]   meaning specific wavelengths of red light
[00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:08.400]   and near-infrared light in specific combinations
[00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:11.080]   to trigger the optimal cellular adaptations.
[00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:12.960]   Personally, I use the Juve whole body panel
[00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:14.600]   about three to four times per week,
[00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:17.000]   typically in the morning, but sometimes in the afternoon,
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:18.880]   and I use the Juve handheld light
[00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:20.900]   both at home and when I travel.
[00:51:20.900 --> 00:51:22.040]   If you'd like to try Juve,
[00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:26.320]   you can go to juve, spelled J-O-O-V-V.com/huberman.
[00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:28.240]   Juve is offering an exclusive discount
[00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:29.540]   to all Huberman Lab listeners
[00:51:29.540 --> 00:51:32.640]   with up to $400 off select Juve products.
[00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:36.640]   Again, that's juve, J-O-O-V-V.com/huberman
[00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:38.640]   to get up to $400 off.
[00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:44.680]   I love, love, love this thing about asking for a request.
[00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:47.120]   It's different than asking for feedback,
[00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:49.680]   which could quickly lead to a list of all the things
[00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:52.140]   that one does wrong as opposed to a request
[00:51:52.140 --> 00:51:53.760]   for how one could do better.
[00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:55.760]   So I think there's an important distinction there.
[00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:58.360]   And then it seems that the question that the parent
[00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:00.600]   or who knows, the boss or whatever,
[00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:02.160]   maybe it's with a romantic partner,
[00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:03.860]   needs to ask themselves is,
[00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:08.520]   what is this request really about?
[00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:10.220]   Like what's underneath it?
[00:52:10.220 --> 00:52:12.920]   I'm just paraphrasing essentially what you said.
[00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:13.880]   And what's it really about?
[00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:16.740]   Is it a request for more autonomy,
[00:52:16.740 --> 00:52:18.680]   for more social connection with other people?
[00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:20.680]   And then when it starts to realize it,
[00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:23.480]   certainly in this example that you gave
[00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:26.400]   of a child asking for more time with their phone
[00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:27.240]   late at night,
[00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:28.680]   is that it actually has nothing to do
[00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:30.040]   with your relationship to them.
[00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:31.920]   It's really about their relationship to their friends.
[00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:32.760]   - Yeah, could be.
[00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:34.160]   - And the fact that they might feel
[00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:35.480]   as if they're missing out.
[00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:36.320]   - Yeah.
[00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:38.600]   - And that leads me to another question,
[00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:43.440]   which is what if you as the parent, partner, boss, et cetera,
[00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:47.220]   keep your phone close to you until midnight?
[00:52:47.220 --> 00:52:48.260]   And they know that.
[00:52:48.260 --> 00:52:49.100]   - Yeah.
[00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:51.980]   - So one of the worst things that I believe anyone can say
[00:52:51.980 --> 00:52:54.060]   is do as I say, not as I do.
[00:52:54.060 --> 00:52:57.700]   It's just such a blatantly arrogant stance
[00:52:57.700 --> 00:53:01.660]   of you're supposed to do what I say because I say so,
[00:53:01.660 --> 00:53:04.340]   but I'm not gonna do it because I don't want to.
[00:53:04.340 --> 00:53:07.140]   And yet there are times like in parent-child relationships
[00:53:07.140 --> 00:53:09.020]   or boss-employee relationships
[00:53:09.020 --> 00:53:11.860]   where you're telling somebody to do something
[00:53:11.860 --> 00:53:13.900]   and you yourself are not going to do it
[00:53:13.900 --> 00:53:15.880]   or no longer do it or choose not to do it.
[00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:19.040]   And in reality, you don't have to.
[00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:19.880]   - Yeah.
[00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:21.080]   - And maybe there's a good reason why you don't
[00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:21.920]   or don't have to.
[00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:22.760]   - Yeah.
[00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:25.520]   - That's the nature of, that's why I use these words,
[00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:26.360]   power dynamics.
[00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:27.180]   - Power, yes.
[00:53:27.180 --> 00:53:29.120]   - Which everyone hears and goes, oh boy, here we go.
[00:53:29.120 --> 00:53:30.920]   But it is an issue of power dynamics.
[00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:33.560]   You have more power than the kid.
[00:53:33.560 --> 00:53:34.400]   - Yes.
[00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:36.080]   - So what you're doing is you're giving the kid power
[00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:39.040]   to express where they want more agency.
[00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:41.160]   I like the word maybe agency more than power.
[00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:42.000]   - Yeah.
[00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:46.820]   - Did you grant your son the right to use his phone
[00:53:46.820 --> 00:53:47.720]   later into the evening?
[00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:48.560]   - My son, my son has--
[00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:49.840]   - Not to pry into your personal--
[00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:50.680]   - My son did not ask me that.
[00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:51.500]   - Oh, okay, sorry.
[00:53:51.500 --> 00:53:53.400]   - And he knows that our phone rules are non-negotiable.
[00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:55.540]   - No, I didn't mean to pry into your family dynamics, but--
[00:53:55.540 --> 00:53:57.160]   - No, but that kid, if that's a rule,
[00:53:57.160 --> 00:53:58.440]   you would never give it to them.
[00:53:58.440 --> 00:54:01.340]   But I think so many times, and then I'll go back to power,
[00:54:01.340 --> 00:54:05.920]   we shouldn't be afraid to learn more.
[00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:08.100]   I actually just think that's what it is.
[00:54:08.100 --> 00:54:10.280]   Our kid says, oh, my friends get this.
[00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:11.120]   That's not true.
[00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:11.940]   Why don't you just learn more?
[00:54:11.940 --> 00:54:16.640]   They do, it's like learning more about what someone says
[00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:19.560]   doesn't mean you ever have to change your boundary.
[00:54:19.560 --> 00:54:22.240]   Most of conflict is about a lack of understanding anyway.
[00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:25.360]   When you learn more, you're trying to understand.
[00:54:25.360 --> 00:54:28.680]   You understand your kid, understand someone wants to raise
[00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:29.840]   and you think it's ridiculous.
[00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:31.560]   You can learn more.
[00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:32.560]   Tell me what's been going on.
[00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:34.320]   What have you been doing?
[00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:36.480]   Learning more about someone's position
[00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:39.040]   does not weaken your position.
[00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:40.720]   And I think that's really, really important
[00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:42.980]   in any form of leadership.
[00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:45.620]   Now, in terms of the power dynamics,
[00:54:45.620 --> 00:54:47.540]   there is something about the word power that like, you know.
[00:54:47.540 --> 00:54:48.380]   - Is that weird?
[00:54:48.380 --> 00:54:51.100]   - Yeah, I mean, I think the way I think about it
[00:54:51.100 --> 00:54:52.340]   and what we do at Good Insight a lot
[00:54:52.340 --> 00:54:54.660]   in terms of our leadership and parenting style,
[00:54:54.660 --> 00:54:56.240]   I don't use the word power,
[00:54:56.240 --> 00:54:59.580]   but I think it's about embodying your authority.
[00:54:59.580 --> 00:55:01.460]   Parents have authority.
[00:55:01.460 --> 00:55:03.820]   Pilots have authority.
[00:55:03.820 --> 00:55:06.300]   Bosses have authority because they're the ones
[00:55:06.300 --> 00:55:09.740]   kind of who have the job of setting up the whole system
[00:55:09.740 --> 00:55:10.800]   for success.
[00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:12.920]   That's their job, right?
[00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:15.240]   My job isn't to make my kid happy.
[00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:19.000]   My job is to help create the conditions for my kid
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:22.280]   to be like a real functioning, confident adult.
[00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:23.440]   That's what I believe, right?
[00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:25.880]   A pilot's job is definitely not to keep passengers happy.
[00:55:25.880 --> 00:55:28.040]   It's to get everyone safely on the ground.
[00:55:28.040 --> 00:55:30.440]   A boss's job is not to keep everyone happy.
[00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:32.640]   It's to set up the conditions for health and success
[00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:34.120]   of the business, right?
[00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:35.080]   Now, if you know that's your job,
[00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:37.260]   it's no one else's job but the CEO.
[00:55:37.260 --> 00:55:38.600]   I mean, to some degree, all the management,
[00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:40.460]   but that is their job.
[00:55:40.460 --> 00:55:43.660]   And so there's a difference where if the CEO believes
[00:55:43.660 --> 00:55:46.380]   a job needs to be done a certain way,
[00:55:46.380 --> 00:55:47.860]   it's not that they have power.
[00:55:47.860 --> 00:55:51.260]   It's just their role involves having that authority.
[00:55:51.260 --> 00:55:52.700]   And if someone else disagrees,
[00:55:52.700 --> 00:55:54.900]   it's up to them to say you can keep the job or not.
[00:55:54.900 --> 00:55:57.780]   It's just you have different roles.
[00:55:57.780 --> 00:56:00.900]   So, and I actually think owning that very outright,
[00:56:00.900 --> 00:56:03.780]   it's actually something I recently said at work
[00:56:03.780 --> 00:56:06.700]   in a review around something I really wanted
[00:56:06.700 --> 00:56:09.940]   and kind of owned, like in my role as a CEO,
[00:56:09.940 --> 00:56:15.040]   like that is under my role to decide this is important.
[00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:16.120]   And now we have to figure it out.
[00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:17.600]   Let's see, I would love some input
[00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:19.160]   on how we're gonna get this done.
[00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:20.820]   Same thing for a kid.
[00:56:20.820 --> 00:56:25.560]   One of the lines I said over and over and over
[00:56:25.560 --> 00:56:27.120]   to my kid when they were younger,
[00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:28.920]   and I see so many good inside parents
[00:56:28.920 --> 00:56:31.400]   tell me that their kids reflect this back to them later,
[00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:33.560]   is my number one job is to keep you safe.
[00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:35.540]   So what does that mean?
[00:56:35.540 --> 00:56:36.860]   It kind of relates to power.
[00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:40.920]   It can mean, why am I not letting my kid,
[00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:43.780]   I don't know, jump up and down on our kitchen counter?
[00:56:43.780 --> 00:56:46.300]   It's not 'cause I'm pissed that my kid isn't listening.
[00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:48.220]   I'm not letting them jump up and down
[00:56:48.220 --> 00:56:49.580]   on my kitchen counter where there's a light
[00:56:49.580 --> 00:56:51.180]   above their head because my number one job
[00:56:51.180 --> 00:56:54.860]   is to keep my kid safe.
[00:56:54.860 --> 00:56:55.700]   Is that power?
[00:56:55.700 --> 00:56:57.020]   I mean, I guess, I think it's authority.
[00:56:57.020 --> 00:56:58.600]   How would I embody that authority?
[00:56:58.600 --> 00:57:00.780]   I would say, it looks hard for you to get down.
[00:57:00.780 --> 00:57:03.500]   I'm about to pick you up and put you on the floor
[00:57:03.500 --> 00:57:06.960]   because I have authority, right?
[00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:09.580]   We get to this phone discussion, let's say,
[00:57:09.580 --> 00:57:11.740]   and I really do believe that the phone
[00:57:11.740 --> 00:57:14.380]   has to be charged out of the room at a certain time.
[00:57:14.380 --> 00:57:15.740]   I'm gonna understand, I'm gonna understand,
[00:57:15.740 --> 00:57:18.220]   I'm gonna listen, hopefully I'm connected to my kid
[00:57:18.220 --> 00:57:20.420]   and they feel respected by me in a million ways,
[00:57:20.420 --> 00:57:22.140]   and it might lead to me saying,
[00:57:22.140 --> 00:57:26.220]   look, my number one job still is to keep you safe,
[00:57:26.220 --> 00:57:27.620]   and that really means making decisions
[00:57:27.620 --> 00:57:29.660]   that I really believe are good for you,
[00:57:29.660 --> 00:57:32.640]   short-term and long-term, even if you're upset with me.
[00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:35.060]   This is one of those times.
[00:57:35.060 --> 00:57:38.540]   And so, I love you, this might be a point of conflict,
[00:57:38.540 --> 00:57:40.480]   I know we're gonna get through this,
[00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:43.480]   and that is my role as a parent,
[00:57:43.480 --> 00:57:46.520]   and it comes from a place of wanting to protect you.
[00:57:46.520 --> 00:57:50.220]   And I think when you embody your authority in that way,
[00:57:50.220 --> 00:57:53.580]   kids never say thank you, and they will roll their eyes,
[00:57:53.580 --> 00:57:56.780]   and kids always feel loved and protected.
[00:57:56.780 --> 00:57:57.700]   They really do.
[00:57:57.700 --> 00:57:59.100]   I hear it from my kids.
[00:57:59.100 --> 00:58:02.240]   Maybe this is so true.
[00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:03.460]   Sometimes things happen with my kids,
[00:58:03.460 --> 00:58:04.840]   and I'm like, no one's gonna even believe this,
[00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:07.820]   but I was walking with my seven-year-old the other day,
[00:58:07.820 --> 00:58:10.580]   and I said, what does it mean to be a good parent?
[00:58:10.580 --> 00:58:11.420]   What does it really mean?
[00:58:11.420 --> 00:58:12.380]   I'm curious.
[00:58:12.380 --> 00:58:17.380]   He really thought it means you're kind of strict,
[00:58:17.380 --> 00:58:21.020]   and I said, what do you mean strict?
[00:58:21.020 --> 00:58:26.020]   He goes, you have certain rules that you think matter.
[00:58:26.020 --> 00:58:29.720]   And he goes, but it also means
[00:58:29.720 --> 00:58:31.460]   you also have to be loving and fun.
[00:58:32.360 --> 00:58:35.600]   And my heart hurts hearing myself say this
[00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:37.400]   in a good way hurting.
[00:58:37.400 --> 00:58:38.280]   They know.
[00:58:38.280 --> 00:58:39.800]   I think kids know, and maybe he says that
[00:58:39.800 --> 00:58:41.600]   'cause that's what we are, but I think kids know,
[00:58:41.600 --> 00:58:45.000]   and I can't even tell you how many kids I used to work with,
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:49.640]   and teens especially, the pain of their parents
[00:58:49.640 --> 00:58:54.520]   not embodying their authority was so clear.
[00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:58.760]   They knew that they shouldn't be out at a certain time.
[00:58:58.760 --> 00:59:00.600]   They knew that they were hanging out with kids
[00:59:00.600 --> 00:59:03.700]   who were like bad news, and their parents had no idea,
[00:59:03.700 --> 00:59:06.100]   and they felt unanchored.
[00:59:06.100 --> 00:59:07.740]   Like they really, really knew,
[00:59:07.740 --> 00:59:09.660]   not that their parents weren't exerting power.
[00:59:09.660 --> 00:59:11.580]   That word isn't, their parents weren't embodying
[00:59:11.580 --> 00:59:15.100]   their appropriate authority to protect their kids.
[00:59:15.100 --> 00:59:17.060]   - I had something come to mind,
[00:59:17.060 --> 00:59:19.820]   which is not a phrase that I've ever used before
[00:59:19.820 --> 00:59:23.100]   or heard before, but what comes to mind
[00:59:23.100 --> 00:59:26.740]   is kind of statements of stance.
[00:59:26.740 --> 00:59:27.580]   - Yes.
[00:59:27.580 --> 00:59:29.600]   - And I feel like statements of stance
[00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:32.640]   in parent-child relationships, families, workplace,
[00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:34.080]   romantic relationships, et cetera,
[00:59:34.080 --> 00:59:36.680]   are great when they're about actions
[00:59:36.680 --> 00:59:39.180]   or about sort of overriding themes.
[00:59:39.180 --> 00:59:43.000]   Like no matter what, I'm trying to keep you safe.
[00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:44.400]   I might not get everything right,
[00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:47.760]   but like that is like non-negotiable internally,
[00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:50.520]   and I'm gonna try and make it non-negotiable externally.
[00:59:50.520 --> 00:59:53.560]   Like it's a statement of stance about actions.
[00:59:53.560 --> 00:59:56.580]   Or, you know, keeping you healthy and safe
[00:59:56.580 --> 00:59:58.060]   is my number one priority.
[00:59:58.060 --> 00:59:58.940]   Those are facts.
[00:59:58.940 --> 01:00:01.180]   Those are things that one can really say and believe,
[01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:03.700]   and you know, until the end of time,
[01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:06.900]   be trying to incorporate into one's behavior.
[01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:08.540]   But I feel like statements of stance
[01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:11.180]   about emotions are very dangerous.
[01:00:11.180 --> 01:00:14.900]   Like we don't yell in this house.
[01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:20.220]   You know, it's okay to cry, right?
[01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:21.380]   There's always a caveat.
[01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:23.460]   Of course it's okay to cry, right?
[01:00:23.460 --> 01:00:25.460]   But there are times when crying is less appropriate.
[01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:29.920]   There's times when yelling might be appropriate.
[01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:33.080]   There's times when emotions need to be expressed
[01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:35.500]   or not expressed in a particular way,
[01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:39.200]   because look, I don't think I'm alone in thinking that,
[01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:43.680]   you know, the kid tantruming in a public environment
[01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:45.800]   is an embarrassing thing for them,
[01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:47.360]   for their parent, for people around,
[01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:48.860]   and it's not the end of the world, right?
[01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:50.840]   That's a tantrum, for goodness sake, right?
[01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:52.780]   Like people will survive.
[01:00:52.780 --> 01:00:55.800]   But I feel like statements of stance about emotions
[01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:57.180]   kind of hold us to this standard
[01:00:57.180 --> 01:00:59.080]   that we'll never be able to meet.
[01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:01.360]   But that statements of stance about action
[01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:07.100]   are, you know, until we fail and, you know, hope we don't,
[01:01:07.100 --> 01:01:11.000]   we can say things like, you know,
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.640]   my job is always to keep you safe.
[01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:14.920]   I'm always going to try and make the best decision
[01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:18.200]   for you and for your sister, for instance.
[01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:20.220]   But I think that many people,
[01:01:20.220 --> 01:01:21.780]   I'm not just speaking from my own experience,
[01:01:21.780 --> 01:01:24.580]   but in talking to friends and others
[01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:25.840]   that they grew up in homes
[01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:27.420]   where like there were these philosophies,
[01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:29.380]   these like statements of stance.
[01:01:29.380 --> 01:01:30.900]   And the moment that things didn't match
[01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:32.460]   that statement of stance,
[01:01:32.460 --> 01:01:35.240]   like the whole concept of what parents and children
[01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:36.080]   are supposed to be about
[01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:38.300]   just kind of started to dissolve.
[01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:39.980]   And it creates that underlying fear,
[01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:42.660]   like, do they even really know what they're doing?
[01:01:42.660 --> 01:01:45.100]   Or maybe they don't know what they're doing,
[01:01:45.100 --> 01:01:46.220]   but maybe they're trying.
[01:01:46.220 --> 01:01:48.460]   So in any case, it's just something
[01:01:48.460 --> 01:01:50.820]   that maybe we could talk about for a moment.
[01:01:50.820 --> 01:01:51.880]   - I have some reactions to that.
[01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:52.720]   I think, I mean,
[01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:55.500]   I kind of think you're talking about values and principles.
[01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:56.340]   Right?
[01:01:56.340 --> 01:01:59.660]   And so I think there are, in my house, to be honest,
[01:01:59.660 --> 01:02:01.060]   it's not like we have some wall of like,
[01:02:01.060 --> 01:02:02.260]   these are our family values.
[01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:03.100]   That's, I mean-
[01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:03.940]   - I've seen those in people's homes.
[01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:05.380]   - Yeah, that's not-
[01:02:05.380 --> 01:02:06.220]   - Yeah, on the refrigerator.
[01:02:06.220 --> 01:02:08.140]   - Not organized enough to do that.
[01:02:08.140 --> 01:02:10.780]   But if I thought about a couple that come to mind,
[01:02:10.780 --> 01:02:13.060]   like my job is to keep my kids safe.
[01:02:13.060 --> 01:02:15.180]   By the way, safe does not mean
[01:02:15.180 --> 01:02:17.980]   they're never in a situation without risk.
[01:02:17.980 --> 01:02:19.180]   That's not what I mean, you know,
[01:02:19.180 --> 01:02:20.020]   but in general-
[01:02:20.020 --> 01:02:21.340]   - That's its own form of danger.
[01:02:21.340 --> 01:02:22.180]   - Exactly.
[01:02:22.180 --> 01:02:25.300]   The minimization of risk is also not safe, right?
[01:02:25.300 --> 01:02:27.060]   So, but in general, my job is to keep you safe.
[01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:29.300]   I'm not gonna let you do things that, you know,
[01:02:29.300 --> 01:02:30.660]   endanger yourself or others.
[01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:31.980]   So that's one.
[01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:33.840]   Another principle I think about is,
[01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:37.140]   I will always tell you the truth,
[01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:38.980]   even if it's uncomfortable.
[01:02:38.980 --> 01:02:40.900]   Like you can always count on me for that.
[01:02:40.900 --> 01:02:41.860]   We call that kind of,
[01:02:41.860 --> 01:02:44.020]   I call that truth over comfort, right?
[01:02:44.020 --> 01:02:45.340]   So if my kid says to me,
[01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:46.500]   "How are babies made?"
[01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:48.660]   That value is useful, right?
[01:02:49.660 --> 01:02:53.460]   Another thing is like all feelings are allowed.
[01:02:53.460 --> 01:02:55.420]   Not all behaviors are okay, right?
[01:02:55.420 --> 01:02:56.260]   Stuff like that.
[01:02:56.260 --> 01:02:58.300]   - What about we don't swear in this house?
[01:02:58.300 --> 01:02:59.140]   - So what I was about to say-
[01:02:59.140 --> 01:03:01.300]   - And then you're on the phone and then you screw up
[01:03:01.300 --> 01:03:02.900]   and then the kid goes, "You swore."
[01:03:02.900 --> 01:03:05.060]   - To me, what's very different
[01:03:05.060 --> 01:03:09.060]   is these kind of rigidities around behavior.
[01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:09.900]   We don't swear.
[01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:11.020]   Swearing is a behavior.
[01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:12.340]   We don't cry in public.
[01:03:12.340 --> 01:03:13.180]   Behavior.
[01:03:13.180 --> 01:03:14.020]   We don't tantrum here.
[01:03:14.020 --> 01:03:15.100]   That's a behavior.
[01:03:15.100 --> 01:03:18.700]   Behaviors all the time are a manifestation
[01:03:18.700 --> 01:03:22.340]   of feelings that overpower skills.
[01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:24.380]   So saying we don't do certain behaviors,
[01:03:24.380 --> 01:03:26.300]   to me, it doesn't even make logical sense.
[01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:28.060]   Well, what if I'm in a situation
[01:03:28.060 --> 01:03:29.820]   where I have a really intense emotion
[01:03:29.820 --> 01:03:31.540]   and don't have the skill to manage it?
[01:03:31.540 --> 01:03:34.000]   We don't, the behavior's gonna happen.
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.300]   And then I feel like a bad person.
[01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:39.300]   That's very different than values around intention.
[01:03:39.300 --> 01:03:41.860]   I want to be truthful with my kids,
[01:03:41.860 --> 01:03:43.540]   even if things are uncomfortable.
[01:03:43.540 --> 01:03:46.180]   I might fumble around with the words, right?
[01:03:46.180 --> 01:03:47.460]   I might even sometimes lie
[01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:49.540]   because I didn't do that value in action.
[01:03:49.540 --> 01:03:50.540]   But what I can come back to is,
[01:03:50.540 --> 01:03:54.980]   okay, nobody lives their values 100% of the time.
[01:03:54.980 --> 01:03:57.900]   So I think we're talking about actually something core
[01:03:57.900 --> 01:03:59.260]   to what we think about a good inside,
[01:03:59.260 --> 01:04:02.940]   which is I'm a good person with values
[01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:04.980]   who is totally imperfect
[01:04:04.980 --> 01:04:07.500]   and sometimes acts in ways I'm not proud of.
[01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:08.420]   Both are true.
[01:04:08.420 --> 01:04:12.060]   When families have values that are very behavior-based,
[01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:13.420]   what ends up happening in the kids
[01:04:13.420 --> 01:04:17.540]   is they start to equate certain behaviors with morality.
[01:04:17.540 --> 01:04:21.220]   These are good behaviors that make me loved in my family.
[01:04:21.220 --> 01:04:23.300]   And these are bad behaviors
[01:04:23.300 --> 01:04:24.300]   that kind of make me feel like
[01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:26.280]   I'm not the right part of my family.
[01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:28.980]   And they even make me wonder, am I lovable?
[01:04:28.980 --> 01:04:31.140]   Am I good inside after all, right?
[01:04:31.140 --> 01:04:32.380]   Am I worthy?
[01:04:32.380 --> 01:04:33.420]   That's not good.
[01:04:33.420 --> 01:04:37.760]   Because whenever we tie behavior to identity, that's shame.
[01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:40.540]   And we've tried to motivate kids
[01:04:40.540 --> 01:04:43.100]   with shame for hundreds and hundreds of years,
[01:04:43.100 --> 01:04:46.180]   and it does not work and causes a lot of problems.
[01:04:46.180 --> 01:04:47.460]   I think another one, which is interesting,
[01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:48.540]   especially as my kids get older,
[01:04:48.540 --> 01:04:50.580]   I said this to my teen recently,
[01:04:50.580 --> 01:04:52.700]   is that this is really tricky.
[01:04:52.700 --> 01:04:54.540]   One of my jobs, as always,
[01:04:54.540 --> 01:04:58.180]   has been to create guidelines and rules with you.
[01:04:58.180 --> 01:04:59.620]   It's always gonna be kind of collaborative.
[01:04:59.620 --> 01:05:01.980]   Some, because of my authority, will be directive
[01:05:01.980 --> 01:05:04.300]   that I believe are gonna keep you safe.
[01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:05.540]   And I think this really relates to a phone.
[01:05:05.540 --> 01:05:07.140]   I wanna tell you another part of my job
[01:05:07.140 --> 01:05:09.260]   that might sound contradictory,
[01:05:09.260 --> 01:05:11.580]   but I actually think we just need to hold them both at once.
[01:05:11.580 --> 01:05:14.720]   Another part of my job is to be there for you
[01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:18.080]   when you inevitably go against those guidelines.
[01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:20.620]   And I want you to know that.
[01:05:20.620 --> 01:05:23.740]   We have rules around what can and cannot be done online.
[01:05:23.740 --> 01:05:25.380]   And, and I'll say this here,
[01:05:25.380 --> 01:05:29.100]   and if you do kind of become part
[01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:32.180]   of a really inappropriate text conversation,
[01:05:32.180 --> 01:05:33.780]   if there is bullying,
[01:05:33.780 --> 01:05:36.100]   if you do come across some images online
[01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:37.500]   that make you feel really uncomfortable
[01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:39.740]   and you're like, "I shouldn't have seen that,"
[01:05:39.740 --> 01:05:41.260]   you're not getting in trouble with me.
[01:05:41.260 --> 01:05:43.580]   I'm not gonna throw you a party.
[01:05:43.580 --> 01:05:46.340]   I will be there for you to help you through those moments.
[01:05:46.340 --> 01:05:47.940]   Those things sound contradictory,
[01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:50.340]   and in our family, we know two things can be true,
[01:05:50.340 --> 01:05:51.900]   and those are both true, right?
[01:05:51.900 --> 01:05:54.860]   To me, that's a really important thing
[01:05:54.860 --> 01:05:56.020]   for a teenager to know.
[01:05:56.020 --> 01:05:58.920]   - Let's talk about guilt and shame.
[01:05:58.920 --> 01:05:59.760]   - Yes.
[01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:01.540]   - I've heard some kind of catchphrase-y stuff,
[01:06:01.540 --> 01:06:02.660]   not from you, but like,
[01:06:02.660 --> 01:06:05.300]   "Oh, you know, guilt is about the thing you did,
[01:06:05.300 --> 01:06:07.400]   and shame is a feeling about who we are,
[01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:09.980]   and, you know, while I'm not against
[01:06:09.980 --> 01:06:14.980]   those sort of 1990s, early 2000s kind of psychology-isms,
[01:06:14.980 --> 01:06:17.780]   I feel like they're not very useful,
[01:06:17.780 --> 01:06:20.180]   in the same way that hearing that there's a gap
[01:06:20.180 --> 01:06:21.660]   between stimulus and response,
[01:06:21.660 --> 01:06:23.660]   and if you identify that gap, well, then, goodness,
[01:06:23.660 --> 01:06:24.740]   you're gonna be the kind of person
[01:06:24.740 --> 01:06:27.020]   that can feel stressed but not be reactive.
[01:06:27.020 --> 01:06:29.100]   You're gonna be responsive, not reactive.
[01:06:29.100 --> 01:06:32.020]   That's just a bunch of words that doesn't,
[01:06:32.020 --> 01:06:33.460]   here, I'm a biologist, so I'll just say,
[01:06:33.460 --> 01:06:34.740]   doesn't take into account the fact
[01:06:34.740 --> 01:06:39.060]   that the biology of stress changes your perception of time,
[01:06:39.060 --> 01:06:40.180]   and a whole bunch of other things
[01:06:40.180 --> 01:06:43.580]   that basically make that gap between stimulus and response
[01:06:43.580 --> 01:06:47.020]   much, much smaller, and I think once people understand that,
[01:06:47.020 --> 01:06:51.220]   they go, "Oh, so like the kitchen refrigerator magnet,
[01:06:51.220 --> 01:06:53.180]   or the poster on the wall that says, you know,
[01:06:53.180 --> 01:06:55.580]   like there's a gap between stimulus and response,
[01:06:55.580 --> 01:06:57.100]   it was supposed to save me, but it didn't?"
[01:06:57.100 --> 01:06:58.140]   Of course not.
[01:06:58.140 --> 01:06:59.880]   Like, we're just in different states of mind
[01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:00.720]   at different times. - Yes.
[01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:04.880]   - So, how do you define, no pressure here,
[01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:08.920]   but how do you define guilt versus shame?
[01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:09.760]   - Great.
[01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:12.960]   - And what about guilt and shame?
[01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:14.340]   - Great, two of my favorite topics.
[01:07:14.340 --> 01:07:16.320]   I have a couple different ways of defining things.
[01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:19.720]   I'm like you, to me, I like defining things
[01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:22.980]   in ways that are very concrete and very usable, that's all,
[01:07:22.980 --> 01:07:25.000]   and if there's multiple ways of doing that, that's great.
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.040]   So, the way I think about guilt,
[01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:28.600]   and this will probably set us off in a direction
[01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:30.920]   about what is not guilt also,
[01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:33.080]   is guilt is a feeling I have
[01:07:33.080 --> 01:07:37.040]   when I act out of alignment with my values.
[01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:41.800]   And in that way, guilt is a really useful feeling,
[01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:45.120]   real useful, because it makes me reflect on,
[01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:49.400]   "Wait, I didn't act in line with my values, I wonder why?
[01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:50.720]   What would I have had to do differently?
[01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:52.160]   What got in my way?
[01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:54.480]   Wow, I'm so glad I have that information from my body
[01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:56.740]   to have this deeply uncomfortable feeling
[01:07:56.740 --> 01:07:58.280]   to set in that process," right?
[01:07:58.280 --> 01:08:02.680]   So, if I yell at my kid, I'm gonna feel guilty, right?
[01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:05.240]   I think about a time when my kid told me,
[01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:07.280]   "You know, I lied to you.
[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:10.000]   I did take that eraser from that kid in school,
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000]   and I feel really guilty," and I said,
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.480]   "First of all, I'm so glad you told me that.
[01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:16.960]   I'm so glad you're feeling guilty.
[01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:18.800]   That's the right way to feel.
[01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:20.720]   Now, there must have been something so hard
[01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:24.060]   about seeing something so shiny and fun that you don't have.
[01:08:24.060 --> 01:08:26.720]   I totally get that," and you're right.
[01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:28.640]   That's not in your values to take it.
[01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:30.280]   So, that's a useful feeling.
[01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:32.640]   That feeling's gonna help you not do something like that.
[01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:34.740]   Again, let's figure out what you can do,
[01:08:34.740 --> 01:08:37.200]   not just to say, "Sorry, this is what parents miss."
[01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:39.160]   You know what's gonna happen another time?
[01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:41.280]   They're gonna see something else pretty cool.
[01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:44.800]   Someone's cubby, and you know what most people think?
[01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:45.620]   "I'm gonna take that."
[01:08:45.620 --> 01:08:46.720]   You're gonna have the thought again.
[01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:47.920]   I would, too.
[01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:49.960]   What can you do the next time you have that thought, right?
[01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:53.080]   All of this comes because of guilt, useful feeling.
[01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:54.960]   Guilt is a feeling you have
[01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:57.120]   when you act out of alignment with your values.
[01:08:57.120 --> 01:09:01.400]   Now, to me, guilt is one of the most misunderstood feelings
[01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:03.300]   because what you hear all the time,
[01:09:03.300 --> 01:09:05.420]   and you'll hear how much it kind of conflicts
[01:09:05.420 --> 01:09:07.680]   with this definition, is something like this.
[01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:11.800]   "I haven't seen my friends in years.
[01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:13.880]   There's finally a dinner,
[01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:18.280]   but it would require me not to put my kid down to sleep."
[01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:20.920]   You know, and I'm talking to someone, I'd say,
[01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:23.400]   "Okay, well, I'm guessing you're not leaving your kid alone."
[01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:25.320]   You know, again, my husband or my mom,
[01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:27.080]   someone who's a totally safe adult.
[01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:32.560]   "But, Becky, I told my kid, and she was clinging to me,
[01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:34.840]   like, 'No, Mommy, I needed to be you, I needed to be you,
[01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:37.560]   and so I'm not going to dinner.'"
[01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:38.400]   Do you know what I'm gonna say, Andrew?
[01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:41.960]   "Because I feel so guilty."
[01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:44.440]   This is, right, "Ugh, someone asked me
[01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:46.860]   to be in the PTA meeting, and I'm so busy.
[01:09:46.860 --> 01:09:51.640]   I can't, but I can't do it because I feel so guilty."
[01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:55.760]   Okay, again, I'm just curious.
[01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:57.400]   I say, "Well, it sounds like you really want
[01:09:57.400 --> 01:09:59.200]   to go to dinner with your friends."
[01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:00.360]   She's like, "Oh, I do.
[01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:01.640]   All I do is parent these days.
[01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:03.000]   I literally haven't seen these friends in years.
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:03.840]   They're in town."
[01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:05.200]   And I said, "Tell me about your friendships.
[01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:06.680]   That's when you value my..."
[01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:10.880]   Yes, I know that I'm kind of more than just someone
[01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:12.800]   who puts down my kid for bed, and I love doing that,
[01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:13.840]   but this matters, too.
[01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:15.040]   So I said, "This is really interesting.
[01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:17.680]   You really value your friendships.
[01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:21.320]   Your life right now feels out of balance
[01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:22.800]   in that your friendships,
[01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:25.160]   that part of your burner of your stove is really low.
[01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:27.800]   Okay, and you're not going because you feel guilty.
[01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:28.680]   I just want to share an idea.
[01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:30.720]   Guilt is a feeling you have when you act out of alignment
[01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:31.880]   with your values.
[01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:35.440]   It seems like going to dinner would be in line
[01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:36.400]   with your values."
[01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:37.920]   And almost, it's like, "Yeah, that's true."
[01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:39.760]   So what is this feeling?
[01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:42.760]   And here's what I think the feeling is.
[01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:45.240]   I call it not guilt just 'cause I haven't figured out
[01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:46.300]   a more sophisticated term,
[01:10:46.300 --> 01:10:48.120]   but here's what I think is happening.
[01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:51.440]   A lot of us, especially women,
[01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:53.320]   when we were growing up,
[01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:57.920]   we learned to notice everyone's feelings around us,
[01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:01.720]   and we learned that our value, really,
[01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:02.920]   and our worth, really,
[01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:07.320]   and we were kind of best and good girls
[01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:11.760]   when we took care of everyone else's feelings
[01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:12.720]   except for our own.
[01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:16.200]   I think so many young girls, especially,
[01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:21.200]   become expert at what people need of them
[01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:25.640]   by becoming distant from what they need for themselves.
[01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:27.040]   The picture I get in my mind is sort of like
[01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:30.280]   having antennae cast in every direction,
[01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:34.000]   except perhaps at the exclusion of paying attention
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.600]   to the antennae that are inward.
[01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:37.440]   Exactly.
[01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:40.440]   And we are, you know, attentional resources are finite.
[01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:42.640]   I mean, we just don't have the capacity to,
[01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:45.680]   like, respond to other people's emotions
[01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:47.580]   and feel at the same time to the same degree
[01:11:47.580 --> 01:11:49.040]   that we would if we just concentrated
[01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:49.880]   on theirs or our emotions.
[01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:51.760]   I mean, that's just a fact of how humans work.
[01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:53.740]   Yeah, and kids are oriented by attachment.
[01:11:53.740 --> 01:11:55.560]   They have to learn with their families,
[01:11:55.560 --> 01:11:58.840]   how do I become the most lovable, safest version of myself?
[01:11:58.840 --> 01:12:01.560]   So I have a friend who, it's true, I remember her.
[01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:03.900]   Even in middle school, I can't come.
[01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:06.280]   My dad's traveling, and my mom really needs me
[01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:08.400]   to stay home and watch a movie with her, right?
[01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:09.640]   And I know this mom well.
[01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:12.000]   It's like, "Oh, you don't love me, you don't," right?
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.520]   I mean, this was, so she became expert
[01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:18.240]   at always noticing other people's emotions,
[01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:22.560]   and not only noticing them, taking the emotions from them,
[01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:25.240]   kind of like taking them into their body
[01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:28.360]   and almost metabolizing them for them.
[01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:31.360]   That's not guilt.
[01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:35.780]   That is taking someone else's emotions
[01:12:35.780 --> 01:12:37.320]   and taking them into your body
[01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:41.400]   at the expense of taking care of your own needs.
[01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:42.580]   And so I have a visual for this,
[01:12:42.580 --> 01:12:43.760]   'cause I think it's really powerful,
[01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:46.640]   where let's say it's the situation where a mom is saying,
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:49.000]   "I really wanna go out to dinner, but I feel so guilty."
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.360]   First thing's just powerful to say, "That is not guilt.
[01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:53.400]   "It is something else, and it is real, and it is powerful,
[01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:54.880]   "but it is not guilt."
[01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:57.160]   What is happening?
[01:12:57.160 --> 01:12:59.800]   I'm on one side of a tennis court, like me and you, Andrew,
[01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:01.080]   but let's say it's a tennis court,
[01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:02.840]   and you're on the other side, or even,
[01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:06.440]   and in between, instead of a net, it's like a glass table.
[01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:11.280]   Over here, I am here in my desire to go out with my friends
[01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:12.960]   because I do value my friendships.
[01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:17.040]   Okay, over there is you're upset about it.
[01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:18.640]   And let's say instead you're my daughter.
[01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:21.300]   You're like, "No, no, don't go.
[01:13:21.300 --> 01:13:22.720]   "No one else can put me to bed."
[01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:24.000]   That is definitely hard to deal with,
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.960]   but that is your daughter's feelings.
[01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:28.060]   Those are not your feelings.
[01:13:28.060 --> 01:13:29.280]   Those are your daughter's feelings.
[01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:32.960]   And some of us/a lot of us have developed this tendency
[01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:34.800]   where we're on this court, and all of a sudden,
[01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:36.680]   all those feelings from your side
[01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:38.520]   somehow go through that wall,
[01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:41.680]   and they come to your side, and you call it guilt.
[01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:43.440]   It is not guilt.
[01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:45.280]   And to me, one of the most liberating things,
[01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:48.920]   and this actually relates to empathy, as I always say,
[01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:51.460]   is to give that feeling back to its rightful owner.
[01:13:51.460 --> 01:13:55.000]   Because what that means is if I really give it back,
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.400]   now I have a boundary.
[01:13:57.400 --> 01:13:58.840]   That's my kid's feeling.
[01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:00.520]   That's not mine.
[01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:03.160]   And I can now actually empathize.
[01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:04.400]   People said, "No, I was empathizing.
[01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:05.600]   "I wasn't going out."
[01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:06.920]   No, no, no, no, no.
[01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:08.360]   That's not empathy.
[01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:09.840]   You weren't going out with your friends
[01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:12.000]   because you couldn't handle the distress in your body.
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.360]   You just made your daughter's feelings your own.
[01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:16.460]   You just engaged in something almost selfish.
[01:14:16.460 --> 01:14:18.160]   This has nothing to do with your daughter.
[01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:19.040]   In those situations,
[01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:21.000]   that's why we say weird things to our four-year-old.
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.160]   Like, "Don't you want mommy to have friends?"
[01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:24.000]   I feel like four-year-old's like,
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:25.840]   "Why are you asking me that question?"
[01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:26.680]   It's like a pilot being like,
[01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:28.860]   "Don't you want me to make an emergency landing?"
[01:14:28.860 --> 01:14:31.680]   Like, if you need to make an emergency landing,
[01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:33.840]   don't ask me for permission.
[01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:36.320]   Because once I give it back to my daughter, I can do this.
[01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:39.540]   I can say, "You really wish I would put you to bed tonight.
[01:14:39.540 --> 01:14:42.500]   "You're right, it feels so different when grandma does it.
[01:14:42.500 --> 01:14:44.200]   "Oh, it does.
[01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:45.580]   "I'm going out.
[01:14:45.580 --> 01:14:48.000]   "It's okay if you're upset.
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:49.840]   "I'll be back and I'll kiss you
[01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:51.600]   "and I'll see you in the morning."
[01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:53.380]   And then this next part's so important.
[01:14:53.380 --> 01:14:54.220]   When you walk out,
[01:14:54.220 --> 01:14:57.240]   I don't want any person having any illusion
[01:14:57.240 --> 01:14:58.900]   that the daughter's gonna be like,
[01:14:58.900 --> 01:15:01.860]   "Yes, you go, girl.
[01:15:01.860 --> 01:15:04.700]   "No, she is going to scream.
[01:15:04.700 --> 01:15:05.680]   "That's okay."
[01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:07.600]   Going back to the boundary.
[01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:10.400]   You're allowed to take care of your needs
[01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:14.940]   and other people are allowed to be inconvenienced
[01:15:14.940 --> 01:15:16.560]   and upset by it.
[01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:19.440]   It doesn't mean your needs are wrong.
[01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:21.560]   It doesn't mean their feelings are wrong
[01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:24.660]   and it definitely doesn't mean you feel guilty.
[01:15:24.660 --> 01:15:27.760]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:30.420]   and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Element.
[01:15:30.420 --> 01:15:31.880]   Element is an electrolyte drink
[01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:34.400]   that has everything you need, but nothing you don't.
[01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:36.560]   That means the electrolytes, sodium, magnesium,
[01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:39.720]   and potassium, all in the correct ratios, but no sugar.
[01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:41.040]   Proper hydration is critical
[01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:43.160]   for optimal brain and body function.
[01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:44.800]   Even a slight degree of dehydration
[01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:47.460]   can diminish cognitive and physical performance.
[01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:49.720]   It's also important that you get adequate electrolytes.
[01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:52.420]   The electrolytes, sodium, magnesium, and potassium
[01:15:52.420 --> 01:15:53.520]   are vital for the functioning
[01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:54.960]   of all the cells in your body,
[01:15:54.960 --> 01:15:57.200]   especially your neurons or your nerve cells.
[01:15:57.200 --> 01:15:58.600]   Drinking Element dissolved in water
[01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:00.080]   makes it extremely easy to ensure
[01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:01.920]   that you're getting adequate hydration
[01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:03.520]   and adequate electrolytes.
[01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:05.100]   To make sure that I'm getting proper amounts
[01:16:05.100 --> 01:16:06.800]   of hydration and electrolytes,
[01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:08.280]   I dissolve one packet of Element
[01:16:08.280 --> 01:16:10.320]   in about 16 to 32 ounces of water
[01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:11.320]   when I wake up in the morning,
[01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:13.840]   and I drink that basically first thing in the morning.
[01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:15.540]   I also drink Element dissolved in water
[01:16:15.540 --> 01:16:18.200]   during any kind of physical exercise that I'm doing,
[01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:20.280]   especially on hot days when I'm sweating a lot
[01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:23.160]   and therefore losing a lot of water and electrolytes.
[01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:24.000]   They have a bunch of different
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:25.860]   great tasting flavors of Element.
[01:16:25.860 --> 01:16:27.940]   They have watermelon, citrus, et cetera.
[01:16:27.940 --> 01:16:29.200]   Frankly, I love them all.
[01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:30.500]   And now that we're in the winter months
[01:16:30.500 --> 01:16:31.920]   in the Northern Hemisphere,
[01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:34.880]   Element has their chocolate medley flavors back in stock.
[01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:36.200]   I really like the chocolate flavors,
[01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:38.120]   especially the chocolate mint when it's heated up.
[01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:39.560]   So you put it in hot water,
[01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:42.320]   and that's a great way to replenish electrolytes and hydrate,
[01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:44.640]   especially when it's cold and dry outside,
[01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:46.680]   when hydration is especially critical.
[01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:48.040]   If you'd like to try Element,
[01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:51.440]   you can go to drinkelement.com/hubermanlab

[01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:55.560]   with the purchase of any Element drink mix.

[01:16:58.760 --> 01:17:00.400]   to claim a free sample pack.
[01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:03.160]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep.
[01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:04.720]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:07.400]   with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
[01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:09.440]   Now I've spoken many times before on this podcast
[01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:11.560]   about the critical need for us to get adequate amounts
[01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:13.160]   of quality sleep each night.
[01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:15.280]   That's truly the foundation of all mental health,
[01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:16.840]   physical health, and performance.
[01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:18.080]   And one of the best ways to ensure
[01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:19.400]   that you get a great night's sleep
[01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:21.920]   is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment.
[01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:24.680]   And that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep,
[01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:26.460]   your body temperature actually has to drop
[01:17:26.460 --> 01:17:28.000]   by about one to three degrees.
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.480]   And in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized,
[01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:32.440]   your body temperature actually has to increase
[01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:34.000]   about one to three degrees.
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:35.600]   Eight Sleep makes it incredibly easy
[01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:37.800]   to control the temperature of your sleeping environment
[01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:39.400]   by allowing you to control the temperature
[01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:41.000]   of your mattress cover at the beginning,
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:42.640]   middle, and end of the night.
[01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:44.300]   I've been sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover
[01:17:44.300 --> 01:17:45.560]   for nearly four years now,
[01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:47.400]   and it has completely transformed
[01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:48.980]   and improved the quality of my sleep.
[01:17:48.980 --> 01:17:51.120]   Eight Sleep has now launched their newest generation
[01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:53.760]   of the pod cover, the Pod 4 Ultra.
[01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:56.920]   The Pod 4 Ultra has improved cooling and heating capacity,
[01:17:56.920 --> 01:17:59.120]   higher fidelity sleep tracking technology,
[01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:00.580]   and even has snoring detection
[01:18:00.580 --> 01:18:02.880]   that will automatically lift your head a few degrees
[01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:05.260]   to improve your airflow and stop your snoring.
[01:18:05.260 --> 01:18:07.400]   If you'd like to try an Eight Sleep mattress cover,
[01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:09.800]   go to eightsleep.com/huberman
[01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:13.360]   to save up to $350 off their Pod 4 Ultra.
[01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:15.920]   Eight Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, UK,
[01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:18.460]   select countries in the EU, and Australia.
[01:18:18.460 --> 01:18:21.540]   Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman.
[01:18:21.540 --> 01:18:24.100]   - Wow.
[01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:27.380]   I say wow because I think the lens
[01:18:27.380 --> 01:18:28.780]   that you're looking at guilt through
[01:18:28.780 --> 01:18:31.060]   and the way you're defining it is so very different
[01:18:31.060 --> 01:18:32.760]   than the way it's been discussed ever.
[01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:36.260]   And I think this is a super, super important topic.
[01:18:36.260 --> 01:18:39.160]   So I'd like to lathe into it a little bit more.
[01:18:39.160 --> 01:18:44.820]   In some ways, the way that I think
[01:18:44.820 --> 01:18:46.900]   many people experience guilt,
[01:18:46.900 --> 01:18:48.060]   at least according to your definition,
[01:18:48.060 --> 01:18:50.540]   which, by the way, I love,
[01:18:50.540 --> 01:18:53.220]   it's when we act out of alignment with our values.
[01:18:54.060 --> 01:18:56.420]   Versus feeling pressure.
[01:18:56.420 --> 01:18:59.180]   Like, I think about, you know, I mean,
[01:18:59.180 --> 01:19:00.780]   Lord knows I don't have the best reputation
[01:19:00.780 --> 01:19:04.340]   as having a short text response latency.
[01:19:04.340 --> 01:19:06.320]   It's variable.
[01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:07.660]   Sometimes I'm quick on the draw,
[01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:09.200]   and other times I'm like, oh goodness,
[01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:10.220]   it'll be days or weeks.
[01:19:10.220 --> 01:19:11.940]   I mean, over the holidays, I was spooling through it.
[01:19:11.940 --> 01:19:14.400]   I would respond to people like a week later.
[01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:17.180]   And, you know, I do my best,
[01:19:17.180 --> 01:19:22.180]   but I do often feel quote-unquote guilty
[01:19:22.500 --> 01:19:25.820]   about not being as responsive in text to a number of people,
[01:19:25.820 --> 01:19:27.380]   because I care about them.
[01:19:27.380 --> 01:19:29.060]   I value them.
[01:19:29.060 --> 01:19:31.980]   But I get overwhelmed by text messaging very easily,
[01:19:31.980 --> 01:19:34.180]   to the point where I have to put my phones out of the room
[01:19:34.180 --> 01:19:36.260]   when I work, et cetera.
[01:19:36.260 --> 01:19:40.660]   So the way I experience a bunch of text messages coming in
[01:19:40.660 --> 01:19:44.220]   is as pressure, that then I feel guilty.
[01:19:44.220 --> 01:19:45.540]   I'm not trying to make this about me, but--
[01:19:45.540 --> 01:19:46.380]   - No, I want to.
[01:19:46.380 --> 01:19:47.200]   Let's go into this.
[01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:48.040]   I have a lot to say.
[01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:50.260]   - I feel quote-unquote guilty, but do I really feel,
[01:19:50.260 --> 01:19:51.580]   but what's interesting is, you know,
[01:19:51.580 --> 01:19:53.220]   I believe in cognitive dissonance.
[01:19:53.220 --> 01:19:54.820]   And then what I notice is that
[01:19:54.820 --> 01:19:57.220]   then my brain tries to bridge that gap.
[01:19:57.220 --> 01:19:59.660]   I come up with these like justifications with like,
[01:19:59.660 --> 01:20:00.780]   well, when I text people
[01:20:00.780 --> 01:20:02.020]   and they don't respond for like two weeks,
[01:20:02.020 --> 01:20:03.420]   I don't get upset, which is true,
[01:20:03.420 --> 01:20:06.480]   unless it's in a particular sort of category of circumstances.
[01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:09.940]   So how come the way they view this whole dynamic
[01:20:09.940 --> 01:20:11.820]   is not the same as the way I view this dynamic?
[01:20:11.820 --> 01:20:13.740]   Okay, maybe this is a more male-centric view
[01:20:13.740 --> 01:20:15.300]   as opposed to feeling porous,
[01:20:15.300 --> 01:20:17.420]   like I feel they're upset.
[01:20:17.420 --> 01:20:20.740]   But I will say, you know, in fairness to all the chromosomes
[01:20:20.740 --> 01:20:23.760]   in their arrangements, I do feel bad.
[01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:24.600]   - Yeah.
[01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:25.420]   - Like it sucks.
[01:20:25.420 --> 01:20:27.300]   Like I love these people and they're reaching out
[01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:29.580]   to say whatever, happy new year or something.
[01:20:29.580 --> 01:20:33.940]   And I'm feeling pressure as opposed to feeling
[01:20:33.940 --> 01:20:35.620]   how wonderful it is to have people in my life.
[01:20:35.620 --> 01:20:37.940]   - So here, this is such a beautiful example
[01:20:37.940 --> 01:20:40.460]   where I'd ask myself, or I'd ask you to ask yourself,
[01:20:40.460 --> 01:20:43.980]   okay, you already named one of your values,
[01:20:43.980 --> 01:20:45.180]   which is interesting.
[01:20:45.180 --> 01:20:46.620]   I really value my relationships.
[01:20:46.620 --> 01:20:47.460]   You said that.
[01:20:47.460 --> 01:20:49.580]   Okay, that's one value.
[01:20:49.580 --> 01:20:51.380]   And I think this is, I'm gonna ask this question.
[01:20:51.380 --> 01:20:56.180]   Do you value quick responses all the time
[01:20:56.180 --> 01:20:57.780]   from you on text message?
[01:20:57.780 --> 01:20:59.020]   Is that a value of yours?
[01:20:59.020 --> 01:21:00.340]   - From me or to me?
[01:21:00.340 --> 01:21:01.180]   - From you.
[01:21:01.180 --> 01:21:04.700]   Do I value always responding to people on text right away?
[01:21:04.700 --> 01:21:07.180]   - The truth is, if I'm really honest,
[01:21:07.180 --> 01:21:11.700]   I hate shallow exchange of any kind,
[01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:14.100]   except maybe a fist bump to somebody
[01:21:14.100 --> 01:21:15.980]   you just kind of feel some kinship with on the street
[01:21:15.980 --> 01:21:16.820]   and you have that connect
[01:21:16.820 --> 01:21:19.220]   and you just give them the fist bump, great.
[01:21:19.220 --> 01:21:22.700]   But I like more in-depth, lengthy connection.
[01:21:22.700 --> 01:21:24.060]   - Like three-hour long conversations?
[01:21:24.060 --> 01:21:26.620]   - Three-hour long conversations or drop,
[01:21:26.620 --> 01:21:29.180]   a friend came by the other day for New Year's.
[01:21:29.180 --> 01:21:30.540]   He was on my list of people that,
[01:21:30.540 --> 01:21:32.700]   and yes, I made a list of people that I want to
[01:21:32.700 --> 01:21:34.860]   deepen my friendship with in the new year.
[01:21:34.860 --> 01:21:37.300]   He came by, we had a two-hour lunch.
[01:21:37.300 --> 01:21:41.220]   We chatted and I feel like it was awesome
[01:21:41.220 --> 01:21:44.180]   and worth a million single line text messages.
[01:21:44.180 --> 01:21:45.820]   And I'm also the kind of person where like,
[01:21:45.820 --> 01:21:47.940]   I'm good to not see him for a while,
[01:21:47.940 --> 01:21:49.100]   not because I'm tired of him,
[01:21:49.100 --> 01:21:51.820]   but because I also have other friends and things to do.
[01:21:51.820 --> 01:21:54.820]   So I'm more of a depth, not breadth kind of guy.
[01:21:54.820 --> 01:21:57.140]   - This is, to me, this is such a powerful process.
[01:21:57.140 --> 01:21:58.740]   And then after this, I kind of want to link it back
[01:21:58.740 --> 01:22:00.940]   to how I've actually told my kids
[01:22:00.940 --> 01:22:05.060]   about why I do go out to dinner with friends, right?
[01:22:05.060 --> 01:22:06.940]   So I value deep relationships.
[01:22:06.940 --> 01:22:07.780]   I value relationships.
[01:22:07.780 --> 01:22:09.220]   I value deep relationship.
[01:22:09.220 --> 01:22:11.540]   And if I'm honest with myself,
[01:22:11.540 --> 01:22:12.940]   responding to someone right away,
[01:22:12.940 --> 01:22:14.260]   that's actually not my value.
[01:22:14.260 --> 01:22:16.060]   But again, we can hold multiple things at once.
[01:22:16.060 --> 01:22:18.020]   That doesn't mean I don't care about those people.
[01:22:18.020 --> 01:22:20.580]   And I just laid out all my values.
[01:22:20.580 --> 01:22:24.940]   What I think is so powerful as a not guilt diffuser
[01:22:24.940 --> 01:22:27.980]   is naming this directly to the people.
[01:22:27.980 --> 01:22:29.620]   So it doesn't have to be on text,
[01:22:29.620 --> 01:22:30.980]   but you're seeing person X and you know,
[01:22:30.980 --> 01:22:32.020]   I'm never that good.
[01:22:32.020 --> 01:22:34.780]   I just want to tell you, I really value our friendship.
[01:22:34.780 --> 01:22:37.380]   I really value these times we have together.
[01:22:37.380 --> 01:22:39.020]   Something I just also want to get off my chest
[01:22:39.020 --> 01:22:42.020]   is going back and forth quickly on text.
[01:22:42.020 --> 01:22:46.060]   That's not something that's easy for me that I do very often.
[01:22:46.060 --> 01:22:49.220]   And so you might text me and it might take me a while.
[01:22:49.220 --> 01:22:51.740]   And I just wanted to name that to you, right?
[01:22:51.740 --> 01:22:54.460]   Now look, someone else always has the right to say,
[01:22:54.460 --> 01:22:55.340]   well, that's interesting.
[01:22:55.340 --> 01:22:56.180]   That doesn't work for me.
[01:22:56.180 --> 01:22:58.220]   One of my top values with friends
[01:22:58.220 --> 01:23:00.780]   is someone who's always getting back and forth.
[01:23:00.780 --> 01:23:02.020]   To me, that's actually great, great.
[01:23:02.020 --> 01:23:03.580]   Now we know, okay, what are we going to do about that?
[01:23:03.580 --> 01:23:04.420]   That's fine.
[01:23:04.420 --> 01:23:05.540]   You know where someone stands.
[01:23:05.540 --> 01:23:08.140]   And the reason I relate this to the situation
[01:23:08.140 --> 01:23:11.900]   with going to dinner is I remember early on
[01:23:11.900 --> 01:23:12.860]   when my daughter said,
[01:23:12.860 --> 01:23:14.300]   why do you have to go to dinner with friends?
[01:23:14.380 --> 01:23:16.420]   Or why do you and dad, this is it.
[01:23:16.420 --> 01:23:18.300]   Why do you and dad go to dinner without us?
[01:23:18.300 --> 01:23:19.980]   I know the couple you're going out with,
[01:23:19.980 --> 01:23:20.900]   you both have kids.
[01:23:20.900 --> 01:23:22.700]   Why can't you bring us, right?
[01:23:22.700 --> 01:23:25.620]   And this is where we say we feel guilt, but we don't.
[01:23:25.620 --> 01:23:27.300]   'Cause I'm like, time out.
[01:23:27.300 --> 01:23:30.580]   She's feeling this feeling, not me.
[01:23:30.580 --> 01:23:33.940]   And also I don't need her permission or approval.
[01:23:33.940 --> 01:23:35.580]   That's the real parentified thing.
[01:23:35.580 --> 01:23:37.100]   We like go to our seven-year-old and we're like,
[01:23:37.100 --> 01:23:39.780]   don't you want me to have adult conversations?
[01:23:39.780 --> 01:23:40.620]   Again, not-
[01:23:40.620 --> 01:23:42.020]   - It's not an atypical response.
[01:23:42.020 --> 01:23:42.980]   I've heard parents do that.
[01:23:42.980 --> 01:23:43.820]   - Say that.
[01:23:43.820 --> 01:23:45.180]   - Don't you want me to have a social life?
[01:23:45.180 --> 01:23:46.500]   - But you know what it is?
[01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:50.660]   Is asking your kid to do your job for you.
[01:23:50.660 --> 01:23:53.420]   Again, can you imagine a pilot say,
[01:23:53.420 --> 01:23:55.940]   do you think we should make an emergency landing?
[01:23:55.940 --> 01:23:58.900]   You'd be, that's how a kid feels when they're asked that.
[01:23:58.900 --> 01:24:01.660]   They're like, why are you asking me that?
[01:24:01.660 --> 01:24:03.820]   Here's what I said to my daughter in that situation.
[01:24:03.820 --> 01:24:04.900]   I really did.
[01:24:04.900 --> 01:24:06.740]   I want to tell you something.
[01:24:06.740 --> 01:24:07.900]   I love being your mom.
[01:24:07.900 --> 01:24:08.940]   I really do.
[01:24:08.940 --> 01:24:11.380]   It's one of the most important things in my life.
[01:24:12.380 --> 01:24:16.220]   I also really like being married to dad.
[01:24:16.220 --> 01:24:18.340]   And I really like the times we have
[01:24:18.340 --> 01:24:20.620]   when it's just us and other adults.
[01:24:20.620 --> 01:24:22.100]   That's really important.
[01:24:22.100 --> 01:24:22.940]   I remember saying this,
[01:24:22.940 --> 01:24:24.540]   maybe I was really trying to double down.
[01:24:24.540 --> 01:24:28.620]   We actually, we had that before you guys were here.
[01:24:28.620 --> 01:24:29.460]   - And they're like, what?
[01:24:29.460 --> 01:24:31.060]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:24:31.060 --> 01:24:34.140]   And so one of the reasons, I want to be honest with you.
[01:24:34.140 --> 01:24:36.620]   Why do we go to dinner without you?
[01:24:36.620 --> 01:24:37.940]   It's not so much we go to dinner without you.
[01:24:37.940 --> 01:24:40.700]   We think of it as going to dinner with each other
[01:24:40.700 --> 01:24:41.700]   and just adults.
[01:24:41.700 --> 01:24:43.500]   Is that something we really enjoy?
[01:24:43.500 --> 01:24:45.020]   It's really important to us.
[01:24:45.020 --> 01:24:47.260]   It's a really important part of us.
[01:24:47.260 --> 01:24:52.260]   And that's why, like being really vocal about your values,
[01:24:52.260 --> 01:24:58.780]   as opposed to looking to your child unconsciously
[01:24:58.780 --> 01:25:01.540]   to give you permission to have those values.
[01:25:01.540 --> 01:25:05.260]   If you want to use power, that's a power move.
[01:25:05.260 --> 01:25:06.380]   And it's amazing.
[01:25:06.380 --> 01:25:08.660]   This is true in any time in life.
[01:25:08.660 --> 01:25:11.340]   The more you can locate someone,
[01:25:11.340 --> 01:25:13.540]   the more you respect their boundaries.
[01:25:13.540 --> 01:25:14.620]   I use that word a lot.
[01:25:14.620 --> 01:25:16.260]   I know it's like locate.
[01:25:16.260 --> 01:25:17.580]   I'm sure you know people in your life,
[01:25:17.580 --> 01:25:18.700]   like, can I locate them?
[01:25:18.700 --> 01:25:19.620]   You kind of know who they are.
[01:25:19.620 --> 01:25:24.340]   You know what they value and you respect them, right?
[01:25:24.340 --> 01:25:26.180]   When you can't locate someone,
[01:25:26.180 --> 01:25:29.380]   you feel very uneasy around them.
[01:25:29.380 --> 01:25:30.460]   You're kind of like, where are you?
[01:25:30.460 --> 01:25:31.300]   Who are you?
[01:25:31.300 --> 01:25:32.140]   What do you stand for?
[01:25:32.140 --> 01:25:34.140]   And as you can see with my daughter,
[01:25:34.140 --> 01:25:36.620]   I wasn't saying something mean.
[01:25:36.620 --> 01:25:38.660]   I was saying something true.
[01:25:38.660 --> 01:25:40.140]   And so I think with the friendships
[01:25:40.140 --> 01:25:41.580]   and when you say, is this guilty?
[01:25:41.580 --> 01:25:44.300]   It's like, well, maybe my step and my action
[01:25:44.300 --> 01:25:46.780]   is just actually being honest with this person.
[01:25:46.780 --> 01:25:48.420]   I'm not very good at responding right away.
[01:25:48.420 --> 01:25:49.260]   I want to let you know,
[01:25:49.260 --> 01:25:51.460]   I deeply care about our friendship.
[01:25:51.460 --> 01:25:53.020]   I'm not very good at responding
[01:25:53.020 --> 01:25:55.940]   to kind of small talk over text.
[01:25:55.940 --> 01:25:57.380]   And I just wanted to let you know that
[01:25:57.380 --> 01:25:58.660]   so you didn't misinterpret it.
[01:25:58.660 --> 01:25:59.860]   Like, I wonder what would happen.
[01:25:59.860 --> 01:26:03.180]   I wonder if people would kind of respond really positively.
[01:26:03.180 --> 01:26:05.140]   - I love it.
[01:26:05.140 --> 01:26:07.460]   And I can't help but recall when I was a kid,
[01:26:08.940 --> 01:26:12.740]   after dinner, my dad would sometimes take a walk by himself.
[01:26:12.740 --> 01:26:14.500]   Now, granted he's a physicist
[01:26:14.500 --> 01:26:16.420]   and he's a theoretical physicist.
[01:26:16.420 --> 01:26:18.220]   So he's like, all his experiments were in his head
[01:26:18.220 --> 01:26:19.660]   and he did work on paper too.
[01:26:19.660 --> 01:26:22.340]   But so he would take these walks
[01:26:22.340 --> 01:26:24.460]   and occasionally I'd see him coming back from these walks
[01:26:24.460 --> 01:26:26.300]   and he'd be smoking a cigar,
[01:26:26.300 --> 01:26:28.420]   something he doesn't do anymore, fortunately.
[01:26:28.420 --> 01:26:30.020]   I'm grateful that he's very robust.
[01:26:30.020 --> 01:26:32.100]   He was actually a guest on the podcast recently,
[01:26:32.100 --> 01:26:35.180]   talked about science and life, et cetera.
[01:26:35.180 --> 01:26:38.100]   And one of the things that I remember thinking
[01:26:38.100 --> 01:26:40.420]   and still to this day think and feel
[01:26:40.420 --> 01:26:43.500]   is it's kind of awesome how he takes this walk
[01:26:43.500 --> 01:26:45.580]   and he looked like so happy
[01:26:45.580 --> 01:26:48.140]   with the cigar and his thoughts and he'd walk.
[01:26:48.140 --> 01:26:50.140]   And I wanted to be on those walks with him.
[01:26:50.140 --> 01:26:51.260]   He was very, very busy.
[01:26:51.260 --> 01:26:53.860]   In fact, I wanted a lot more time from him than I got.
[01:26:53.860 --> 01:26:55.900]   It's kind of interesting 'cause now it's oftentimes
[01:26:55.900 --> 01:26:59.620]   that I'm the busier one, the table's turned, kids.
[01:26:59.620 --> 01:27:03.460]   But in all seriousness, I didn't think of it as self-care,
[01:27:03.460 --> 01:27:06.260]   but it was so clear that that was his time.
[01:27:06.260 --> 01:27:08.540]   That was absolutely his time.
[01:27:08.540 --> 01:27:13.540]   And I knew when I could and should join for things
[01:27:13.540 --> 01:27:14.380]   and when I didn't.
[01:27:14.380 --> 01:27:16.980]   And so when you say the more you can locate someone,
[01:27:16.980 --> 01:27:18.860]   the more you respect their values,
[01:27:18.860 --> 01:27:20.980]   I feel like bells go off.
[01:27:20.980 --> 01:27:22.140]   - Yeah. - It's like exactly that.
[01:27:22.140 --> 01:27:24.020]   And there are other examples of my mom, et cetera.
[01:27:24.020 --> 01:27:27.740]   But it's kind of interesting when we see somebody,
[01:27:27.740 --> 01:27:30.900]   adult or child, like really in their element
[01:27:30.900 --> 01:27:32.780]   of their thing. - Yes.
[01:27:32.820 --> 01:27:36.820]   - It's almost like we love them for it and through it.
[01:27:36.820 --> 01:27:40.620]   And it fills us, I think, with a healthy sense of safety.
[01:27:40.620 --> 01:27:41.820]   Like they're right there.
[01:27:41.820 --> 01:27:43.460]   Kind of like the pilot flying the plane really well.
[01:27:43.460 --> 01:27:44.300]   - Yeah, that's right. - We're like,
[01:27:44.300 --> 01:27:45.980]   "Actually, we don't really wanna know about the pilot.
[01:27:45.980 --> 01:27:47.420]   "I wanna hear the thing at the beginning.
[01:27:47.420 --> 01:27:48.940]   "We're about ready to take off."
[01:27:48.940 --> 01:27:50.300]   I actually don't like it when we're landing
[01:27:50.300 --> 01:27:52.620]   and they say, "We'll be on the ground in just a few moments."
[01:27:52.620 --> 01:27:53.780]   I'm like, "We're at 10,000 feet.
[01:27:53.780 --> 01:27:55.740]   "Can we make it a little bit longer than that?"
[01:27:55.740 --> 01:27:57.900]   But you get the point,
[01:27:57.900 --> 01:28:00.700]   which is that I don't wanna hear from the pilot.
[01:28:00.700 --> 01:28:02.460]   I just want the pilot to fly the plane.
[01:28:02.460 --> 01:28:04.620]   You want the pilot to do their job.
[01:28:04.620 --> 01:28:07.580]   And again, I think I have so many pilot metaphors
[01:28:07.580 --> 01:28:08.620]   around sturdy leadership.
[01:28:08.620 --> 01:28:09.940]   And I think it really is such a metaphor
[01:28:09.940 --> 01:28:13.820]   for how we teach people the skills they need to parent.
[01:28:13.820 --> 01:28:16.740]   Because again, no one becomes a pilot overnight.
[01:28:16.740 --> 01:28:19.120]   No one becomes a CEO overnight. - Sure hope not.
[01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:20.380]   - No one becomes a lawyer overnight
[01:28:20.380 --> 01:28:22.500]   or a professional basketball player.
[01:28:22.500 --> 01:28:25.620]   I think we actually laud CEOs these days who say,
[01:28:25.620 --> 01:28:27.600]   "I don't know how to do leadership as well as I'd want to.
[01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:29.160]   "I'm getting executive coach."
[01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:31.820]   You all wanna work for that person, right?
[01:28:31.820 --> 01:28:35.700]   The amazing athletes in the world get amazing coaches
[01:28:35.700 --> 01:28:37.300]   and they go to amazing training camps
[01:28:37.300 --> 01:28:38.620]   because they're amazing, right?
[01:28:38.620 --> 01:28:42.100]   And so I just, somehow with parenting,
[01:28:42.100 --> 01:28:44.060]   it's like the last area where people think
[01:28:44.060 --> 01:28:46.060]   I should become an amazing parent overnight.
[01:28:46.060 --> 01:28:49.180]   I shouldn't have to invest in skills or education.
[01:28:49.180 --> 01:28:50.860]   Even people who invest in skills and education
[01:28:50.860 --> 01:28:52.220]   for every other area of their life
[01:28:52.220 --> 01:28:53.500]   that they probably care about less.
[01:28:53.500 --> 01:28:55.700]   There's so much shame we've internalized
[01:28:55.700 --> 01:28:57.980]   that we should be able to do it naturally.
[01:28:57.980 --> 01:28:59.740]   - And you do become a parent overnight.
[01:28:59.740 --> 01:29:01.700]   - You become a parent overnight, you do.
[01:29:01.700 --> 01:29:02.540]   - Yes.
[01:29:02.540 --> 01:29:03.940]   - I'll remember my graduate advisor who had two kids
[01:29:03.940 --> 01:29:06.100]   while I was working in the lab saying
[01:29:06.100 --> 01:29:10.220]   that there were all these books back then about pregnancy.
[01:29:10.220 --> 01:29:11.140]   And she was like, "It's wild.
[01:29:11.140 --> 01:29:12.420]   "There are all these things of what you should eat
[01:29:12.420 --> 01:29:13.660]   "and shouldn't eat and how you should,
[01:29:13.660 --> 01:29:15.140]   "you and your partner and how you should prepare
[01:29:15.140 --> 01:29:16.380]   "for the birth and all this."
[01:29:16.380 --> 01:29:18.980]   And then at the hospital, they're like, "Here."
[01:29:18.980 --> 01:29:20.580]   And you're like, "Ah."
[01:29:20.580 --> 01:29:22.740]   Now granted that was in the early 2000s.
[01:29:22.740 --> 01:29:23.780]   - That's still what it is.
[01:29:23.780 --> 01:29:24.700]   And they're like, "What do you need?"
[01:29:24.700 --> 01:29:26.540]   And they go, "You need a car seat to leave the hospital."
[01:29:26.540 --> 01:29:30.220]   Which by the way, you definitely need, that's all?
[01:29:30.220 --> 01:29:31.500]   Just a car seat?
[01:29:31.500 --> 01:29:32.980]   How am I supposed to manage this?
[01:29:32.980 --> 01:29:35.180]   Because the thing I want parents to know,
[01:29:35.180 --> 01:29:36.740]   'cause again, there's just so much shame
[01:29:36.740 --> 01:29:38.860]   and maybe we should talk about shame, right?
[01:29:38.860 --> 01:29:42.380]   Is the only thing that comes naturally
[01:29:42.380 --> 01:29:45.820]   when it comes to parenting is how you were parented.
[01:29:45.820 --> 01:29:47.620]   That comes naturally, that lives in your bones,
[01:29:47.620 --> 01:29:49.060]   that lives in your circuits.
[01:29:49.060 --> 01:29:51.620]   And there might be some people who say,
[01:29:51.620 --> 01:29:53.700]   "Amazing, I have the greatest privilege in the world
[01:29:53.700 --> 01:29:57.000]   "then what will come naturally is exactly what I value
[01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:58.540]   "and what I wanna do."
[01:29:58.540 --> 01:30:01.300]   I would say more often, people would say some version
[01:30:01.300 --> 01:30:03.020]   of definitely not what I wanna do
[01:30:03.020 --> 01:30:06.780]   or parts I'll take, parts I wanna do differently.
[01:30:06.780 --> 01:30:07.740]   And to me, it's kind of like
[01:30:07.740 --> 01:30:10.220]   if you were brought up speaking English
[01:30:10.220 --> 01:30:11.980]   and you really wanna speak Mandarin
[01:30:11.980 --> 01:30:14.300]   or you wanna speak Mandarin half the time to your kid
[01:30:14.300 --> 01:30:17.260]   and someone said, "Are you gonna learn Mandarin naturally?"
[01:30:17.260 --> 01:30:18.740]   I feel like someone would say like,
[01:30:18.740 --> 01:30:20.980]   "How does one learn Mandarin naturally?"
[01:30:20.980 --> 01:30:23.580]   You would, I don't know, you'd probably sign up
[01:30:23.580 --> 01:30:27.700]   for Duolingo, you'd find an app or something or a course
[01:30:27.700 --> 01:30:29.980]   and you'd then practice and practice
[01:30:29.980 --> 01:30:33.300]   and you'd be able to make progress
[01:30:33.300 --> 01:30:36.620]   because you actually learned something new.
[01:30:36.620 --> 01:30:39.300]   And so I just think big picture,
[01:30:39.300 --> 01:30:42.860]   like parents are, they're so under-equipped
[01:30:42.860 --> 01:30:47.020]   and set up to feel, and this is I think has to do with shame,
[01:30:47.020 --> 01:30:50.740]   that when my kids are struggling or when I'm yelling a lot,
[01:30:50.740 --> 01:30:52.580]   it means something is wrong with me
[01:30:52.580 --> 01:30:54.300]   or something is wrong with my kid.
[01:30:54.300 --> 01:30:57.620]   I feel like these days in almost every area,
[01:30:57.620 --> 01:31:01.500]   if a CEO is saying, "I feel like I'm struggling,
[01:31:01.500 --> 01:31:04.140]   "is it my fault or my employee's fault?"
[01:31:04.140 --> 01:31:06.100]   They probably say, "I don't know,
[01:31:06.100 --> 01:31:06.980]   "there's probably people around.
[01:31:06.980 --> 01:31:07.820]   "Who can help me?
[01:31:07.820 --> 01:31:08.660]   "Who can teach me?
[01:31:08.660 --> 01:31:09.940]   "Why do I keep yelling?"
[01:31:09.940 --> 01:31:12.540]   And same thing with almost every other field.
[01:31:12.540 --> 01:31:15.820]   And to me more than like if there's any legacy
[01:31:15.820 --> 01:31:17.500]   I get to leave in this world,
[01:31:17.500 --> 01:31:19.340]   it's not even the approach itself,
[01:31:19.340 --> 01:31:20.860]   even though I think our approach to parenting
[01:31:20.860 --> 01:31:24.260]   is very different, I just want parents to know
[01:31:24.260 --> 01:31:28.020]   like there is no shame in investing in learning
[01:31:28.020 --> 01:31:30.860]   and growing in parenting.
[01:31:30.860 --> 01:31:31.700]   And to look at that,
[01:31:31.700 --> 01:31:34.700]   like they probably look at every other area of their life.
[01:31:34.700 --> 01:31:38.500]   - I assure you that your legacy extends far beyond that,
[01:31:38.500 --> 01:31:39.620]   but includes it as well.
[01:31:39.620 --> 01:31:41.700]   You've had a tremendous impact and continue to.
[01:31:41.700 --> 01:31:46.260]   I mean, it wasn't long ago that the power dynamics
[01:31:46.260 --> 01:31:48.900]   of parent-child relationships where you do what I say
[01:31:48.900 --> 01:31:50.060]   and I'm the parent, you're the kid
[01:31:50.060 --> 01:31:51.100]   and like that kind of thing.
[01:31:51.100 --> 01:31:53.060]   And I grew up in a different era, I'm 49 now,
[01:31:53.060 --> 01:31:54.860]   and I've been wanting to say I'm 49 now
[01:31:54.860 --> 01:31:56.300]   so that I can actually say something
[01:31:56.300 --> 01:31:58.140]   with having had some experience
[01:31:58.140 --> 01:31:59.940]   when things were truly very different.
[01:31:59.940 --> 01:32:01.060]   They were just so different.
[01:32:01.060 --> 01:32:01.900]   - Yeah.
[01:32:01.900 --> 01:32:03.620]   - It was like you took what you got and you worked with it
[01:32:03.620 --> 01:32:08.020]   and things are so different thanks to your part
[01:32:08.020 --> 01:32:08.860]   in all of this.
[01:32:08.860 --> 01:32:11.540]   And one thing I do wanna return to
[01:32:11.540 --> 01:32:15.540]   because I realized I took us off track with it
[01:32:15.540 --> 01:32:20.540]   is this idea of kids, but perhaps adults as well feeling
[01:32:22.300 --> 01:32:24.300]   or thinking they feel someone else's feelings,
[01:32:24.300 --> 01:32:28.220]   taking that on, this difference between real guilt
[01:32:28.220 --> 01:32:30.900]   and gosh, it's really hard to come up with a word for it.
[01:32:30.900 --> 01:32:32.660]   At one moment I thought, well, maybe it's faux guilt,
[01:32:32.660 --> 01:32:33.780]   but no, you're not pretending,
[01:32:33.780 --> 01:32:37.620]   you're actually feeling something which feels like guilt,
[01:32:37.620 --> 01:32:38.460]   smells like guilt, tastes like guilt.
[01:32:38.460 --> 01:32:40.260]   - Someone said codependence.
[01:32:40.260 --> 01:32:41.900]   I don't know that much about that word,
[01:32:41.900 --> 01:32:43.020]   but something like that.
[01:32:43.020 --> 01:32:45.380]   - Well, it's a whole landscape.
[01:32:45.380 --> 01:32:46.380]   - Yes, exactly.
[01:32:46.380 --> 01:32:48.140]   - It's a whole landscape.
[01:32:48.140 --> 01:32:52.140]   But one practice that I'm familiar with
[01:32:52.140 --> 01:32:55.020]   that I know exists in a couple of different realms
[01:32:55.020 --> 01:32:57.860]   of let's call it modern psychology tools
[01:32:57.860 --> 01:33:01.060]   is this idea of creating a frame separation.
[01:33:01.060 --> 01:33:03.060]   So like after you come together with somebody
[01:33:03.060 --> 01:33:06.140]   to say to like do therapy or something,
[01:33:06.140 --> 01:33:10.460]   or you've had sort of an emotional bind or entanglement,
[01:33:10.460 --> 01:33:12.260]   doesn't have to be negative,
[01:33:12.260 --> 01:33:15.740]   that one way that you can learn over time
[01:33:15.740 --> 01:33:18.620]   to differentiate their needs and wants
[01:33:18.620 --> 01:33:22.140]   from your needs and wants is this idea of in your head,
[01:33:22.140 --> 01:33:23.140]   I know it sounds kind of corny,
[01:33:23.140 --> 01:33:25.260]   but there's a clear neuroscientific basis for this,
[01:33:25.260 --> 01:33:27.220]   at least to my understanding,
[01:33:27.220 --> 01:33:28.540]   of in your head you say, for instance,
[01:33:28.540 --> 01:33:29.380]   like if we had just done this,
[01:33:29.380 --> 01:33:30.660]   like we had some resonance around something,
[01:33:30.660 --> 01:33:32.020]   maybe an argument, okay?
[01:33:32.020 --> 01:33:34.460]   Like Dr. Becky and I got into a fight
[01:33:34.460 --> 01:33:37.140]   that in order to really be able to move away from that
[01:33:37.140 --> 01:33:39.020]   and see it clearly, how much of that was yours?
[01:33:39.020 --> 01:33:40.500]   How much of that was mine?
[01:33:40.500 --> 01:33:42.740]   There's this idea that you tell yourself, okay,
[01:33:42.740 --> 01:33:44.060]   what are five ways in which you and I
[01:33:44.060 --> 01:33:46.380]   are clearly distinct entities?
[01:33:46.380 --> 01:33:48.540]   So you say, and I know this folks might chuckle at this
[01:33:48.540 --> 01:33:50.740]   but you say like, okay, I'm a man, you're a woman.
[01:33:50.740 --> 01:33:52.500]   I live in California.
[01:33:52.500 --> 01:33:54.020]   Dr. Becky lives in New York.
[01:33:54.020 --> 01:33:56.460]   Could even make it like first person,
[01:33:56.460 --> 01:33:57.860]   you say like a third person rather,
[01:33:57.860 --> 01:33:58.980]   you could say I, Andrew Huberman,
[01:33:58.980 --> 01:34:02.660]   am wearing a black shirt and a black over shirt
[01:34:02.660 --> 01:34:05.340]   and Dr. Becky is wearing black and white.
[01:34:05.340 --> 01:34:07.740]   Okay, so some people might think like,
[01:34:07.740 --> 01:34:08.820]   what's the use of that?
[01:34:08.820 --> 01:34:10.540]   But to me as a neuroscientist,
[01:34:10.540 --> 01:34:12.580]   whoever came up with that and it wasn't me
[01:34:12.580 --> 01:34:14.420]   is nothing short of brilliant
[01:34:14.420 --> 01:34:16.700]   because the brain organizes emotions
[01:34:16.700 --> 01:34:19.140]   in these broader schemas of physical objects
[01:34:19.140 --> 01:34:22.380]   and physical distance and distance in time.
[01:34:22.380 --> 01:34:24.020]   And that's the way that we can differentiate
[01:34:24.020 --> 01:34:25.740]   between ourselves and everything around us.
[01:34:25.740 --> 01:34:27.420]   And there's a whole discussion to be had about this.
[01:34:27.420 --> 01:34:31.300]   But so it's something that I've been playing
[01:34:31.300 --> 01:34:33.620]   with a little bit because I don't claim
[01:34:33.620 --> 01:34:37.580]   to be this ultra empath or anything,
[01:34:37.580 --> 01:34:42.580]   but I think it's clear that sometimes
[01:34:42.580 --> 01:34:46.460]   we take in our thoughts and feelings
[01:34:46.460 --> 01:34:47.580]   about what other people are feeling,
[01:34:47.580 --> 01:34:48.900]   sometimes accurate, sometimes not.
[01:34:48.900 --> 01:34:51.140]   And it can become very difficult.
[01:34:51.140 --> 01:34:53.260]   Whether or not someone's a, one of these,
[01:34:53.260 --> 01:34:55.300]   I guess you call it deeply feeling,
[01:34:55.300 --> 01:34:58.740]   deeply feeling kids or not.
[01:34:58.740 --> 01:35:00.900]   I mean, anytime you get into an emotional resonance,
[01:35:00.900 --> 01:35:04.940]   good or bad, I think it's we're porous.
[01:35:04.940 --> 01:35:06.100]   We're porous and that's part of
[01:35:06.100 --> 01:35:07.460]   what makes humans so beautiful.
[01:35:07.460 --> 01:35:10.740]   But I've found that practice to be very useful.
[01:35:10.740 --> 01:35:11.940]   Even if it's just in my own head,
[01:35:11.940 --> 01:35:14.340]   like they're over there and I'm over here,
[01:35:14.340 --> 01:35:16.660]   but not even necessarily pushing off them,
[01:35:16.660 --> 01:35:19.660]   but thinking like, oh, like I'm me and you're you.
[01:35:19.660 --> 01:35:21.140]   And there are a bunch of ways
[01:35:21.140 --> 01:35:22.860]   in which we differ in time and space.
[01:35:22.860 --> 01:35:27.260]   And I think the nervous system comes to understand that
[01:35:27.260 --> 01:35:30.980]   as a felt thing, as opposed to just a statement,
[01:35:30.980 --> 01:35:33.540]   like, hey, like you own your emotions, I'll own mine.
[01:35:33.540 --> 01:35:34.780]   That's just a statement.
[01:35:34.780 --> 01:35:36.780]   Is this any of this?
[01:35:36.780 --> 01:35:38.060]   - I've never heard of that, but I love that.
[01:35:38.060 --> 01:35:40.380]   And it is in parallel, I think,
[01:35:40.380 --> 01:35:42.300]   with so many of the things I teach parents.
[01:35:42.300 --> 01:35:45.140]   So even the idea of locating someone,
[01:35:45.140 --> 01:35:47.620]   to me, like my version of people in my life
[01:35:47.620 --> 01:35:48.500]   that I know and love,
[01:35:48.500 --> 01:35:50.620]   even if I don't agree with anything they say
[01:35:50.620 --> 01:35:51.940]   that I can locate.
[01:35:51.940 --> 01:35:54.940]   They're like an egg with a shell.
[01:35:54.940 --> 01:35:56.140]   They have a shell.
[01:35:56.140 --> 01:35:57.540]   There's like a, there's a boundary.
[01:35:57.540 --> 01:36:00.060]   We're really talking about boundaries.
[01:36:00.060 --> 01:36:02.420]   We all have different levels of porousness
[01:36:02.420 --> 01:36:04.180]   to the external world.
[01:36:04.180 --> 01:36:05.460]   And I think if you know,
[01:36:05.460 --> 01:36:07.180]   and there's pros and cons of both,
[01:36:07.180 --> 01:36:08.740]   like I really mean this,
[01:36:08.740 --> 01:36:12.940]   I am not terribly porous to other people's experiences.
[01:36:12.940 --> 01:36:14.980]   I really have solid boundaries.
[01:36:14.980 --> 01:36:17.340]   There are definitely moments in my closest relationships
[01:36:17.340 --> 01:36:19.260]   because where people will say to me,
[01:36:19.260 --> 01:36:22.140]   okay, like, I know these are my feelings and not yours.
[01:36:22.140 --> 01:36:23.820]   Like, we're in a close relationship.
[01:36:23.820 --> 01:36:26.060]   Like, can you be here a little bit more with me?
[01:36:26.060 --> 01:36:26.940]   And that is true.
[01:36:26.940 --> 01:36:29.860]   Like, that is what I want to do, right?
[01:36:29.860 --> 01:36:32.540]   And sometimes it can be a little distancing, right?
[01:36:32.540 --> 01:36:33.980]   And a little separate.
[01:36:33.980 --> 01:36:37.220]   People on the other end of that spectrum,
[01:36:37.220 --> 01:36:39.580]   if they know I'm very porous, I tend to,
[01:36:39.580 --> 01:36:41.260]   to me, one of the ways of also thinking about it,
[01:36:41.260 --> 01:36:44.580]   I think I gaze in before I gaze out.
[01:36:44.580 --> 01:36:48.260]   And I think a lot of people gaze out before they gaze in.
[01:36:48.260 --> 01:36:50.780]   Right, they spend a lot of time in other people's brains
[01:36:50.780 --> 01:36:52.540]   and less time in their own, right?
[01:36:52.540 --> 01:36:53.380]   What do they think of me?
[01:36:53.380 --> 01:36:55.220]   What do they think, right?
[01:36:55.220 --> 01:36:58.100]   If that's what's going on for you,
[01:36:58.100 --> 01:37:03.100]   then the shell to your egg isn't always intact.
[01:37:03.100 --> 01:37:04.660]   And so there's a spillover.
[01:37:04.660 --> 01:37:06.460]   It's like, whose feelings are whose?
[01:37:06.460 --> 01:37:08.100]   Whose thoughts are whose?
[01:37:08.100 --> 01:37:09.900]   I'm spending so much time worried
[01:37:09.900 --> 01:37:11.500]   about what that person thinks of me.
[01:37:11.500 --> 01:37:13.860]   I almost like, what am I, what do I, what do I think?
[01:37:13.860 --> 01:37:14.700]   Right?
[01:37:14.700 --> 01:37:16.900]   And so the exercise you're naming
[01:37:16.900 --> 01:37:19.860]   is actually just a resetting of a boundary, right?
[01:37:19.860 --> 01:37:23.700]   Is, and things that are absurdly concrete
[01:37:23.700 --> 01:37:27.220]   are necessary for the most primal parts of our brain
[01:37:27.220 --> 01:37:28.820]   to actually understand.
[01:37:28.820 --> 01:37:31.380]   My name is Becky Kennedy.
[01:37:31.380 --> 01:37:32.740]   To me, what I say, I don't usually say that.
[01:37:32.740 --> 01:37:36.340]   I'll say, my feet are on the ground.
[01:37:36.340 --> 01:37:39.620]   When I do a grounding exercise,
[01:37:39.620 --> 01:37:41.700]   everyone in our community knows this,
[01:37:41.700 --> 01:37:43.340]   my hand is always on my heart.
[01:37:43.340 --> 01:37:45.260]   I think there's some amount of having contact
[01:37:45.260 --> 01:37:46.220]   with your body.
[01:37:46.220 --> 01:37:48.260]   My hand is on my heart.
[01:37:48.260 --> 01:37:51.380]   Sometimes I used to do this with clients,
[01:37:51.380 --> 01:37:52.900]   especially after an emotional experience,
[01:37:52.900 --> 01:37:55.620]   going like this, name five things in the room
[01:37:55.620 --> 01:37:56.940]   is probably another way.
[01:37:56.940 --> 01:37:58.340]   There's a red clock.
[01:37:58.340 --> 01:38:00.060]   I'm wearing a white shirt.
[01:38:00.060 --> 01:38:02.940]   They're very, very, very basic
[01:38:02.940 --> 01:38:06.820]   as a way of kind of coming back into your body.
[01:38:06.820 --> 01:38:10.420]   Two mantras that I find help parents a lot
[01:38:10.420 --> 01:38:13.020]   actually make me think about this exercise.
[01:38:13.020 --> 01:38:16.140]   One is, I am the pilot, not the turbulence.
[01:38:16.140 --> 01:38:19.100]   In our kids' turbulent moments,
[01:38:19.100 --> 01:38:20.700]   when they are that turbulence,
[01:38:20.700 --> 01:38:25.460]   what so easily happens is we merge into that with them.
[01:38:25.460 --> 01:38:29.860]   And then it's no wonder our kids can't calm down
[01:38:29.860 --> 01:38:31.180]   and our episodes last forever
[01:38:31.180 --> 01:38:34.100]   'cause we're just turbulence and turbulence together.
[01:38:34.100 --> 01:38:35.740]   So I'm the pilot, not the turbulence.
[01:38:35.740 --> 01:38:38.340]   Also, one day I'm gonna do a partnership
[01:38:38.340 --> 01:38:42.140]   with some airplane company
[01:38:42.140 --> 01:38:44.380]   'cause I feel like airplanes are just so beautiful
[01:38:44.380 --> 01:38:46.660]   because the pilot gets a cockpit.
[01:38:46.660 --> 01:38:47.820]   They get a boundary.
[01:38:47.820 --> 01:38:50.620]   That's what parents need.
[01:38:50.620 --> 01:38:51.460]   So that's one.
[01:38:51.460 --> 01:38:53.460]   And the other one, when your kids are upset
[01:38:53.460 --> 01:38:55.060]   or after there's an argument,
[01:38:55.060 --> 01:38:56.700]   some people get very dysregulated
[01:38:56.700 --> 01:38:58.580]   just knowing someone's upset with them,
[01:38:58.580 --> 01:39:01.580]   which is, again, kind of whose feelings are whose.
[01:39:01.580 --> 01:39:03.260]   I find one of the most effective mantras,
[01:39:03.260 --> 01:39:06.580]   and again, these sound cheesy, is just, I'm safe.
[01:39:06.580 --> 01:39:09.740]   This isn't an emergency.
[01:39:09.740 --> 01:39:10.940]   I can cope with this.
[01:39:10.940 --> 01:39:13.780]   Because our body, if you tend to be porous,
[01:39:13.780 --> 01:39:17.660]   you get activated just by other people being activated,
[01:39:17.660 --> 01:39:20.060]   even though it wasn't your feeling in the first place.
[01:39:20.060 --> 01:39:22.700]   And your body actually needs the reminder
[01:39:22.700 --> 01:39:27.260]   that you're safe to not kind of add to that turbulence.
[01:39:28.300 --> 01:39:29.140]   - Love it.
[01:39:29.140 --> 01:39:33.020]   Can we talk about projection for a second?
[01:39:33.020 --> 01:39:37.100]   One of the things that drives me insane,
[01:39:37.100 --> 01:39:39.020]   people close to me know this,
[01:39:39.020 --> 01:39:43.540]   because of this issue of porousness versus non-porousness
[01:39:43.540 --> 01:39:46.340]   is when people tell me how I feel.
[01:39:46.340 --> 01:39:47.980]   And so I've talked to a few
[01:39:47.980 --> 01:39:49.780]   very qualified psychiatrists about this,
[01:39:49.780 --> 01:39:51.380]   and it's called projection.
[01:39:51.380 --> 01:39:54.180]   Sometimes it's, if in anger, it's evacuative projection.
[01:39:54.180 --> 01:39:56.020]   Like, you think I'm crazy.
[01:39:56.020 --> 01:39:58.020]   Someone will say, like, you think I'm crazy.
[01:39:58.020 --> 01:40:01.460]   Or you're upset with me or something like that.
[01:40:01.460 --> 01:40:06.460]   I feel like projection is one of the kind of litmus tests
[01:40:06.460 --> 01:40:08.460]   of how porous we are.
[01:40:08.460 --> 01:40:11.300]   Because in theory, somebody should be able to tell us
[01:40:11.300 --> 01:40:13.460]   that we feel whatever.
[01:40:13.460 --> 01:40:15.940]   And if we first look inside,
[01:40:15.940 --> 01:40:17.500]   and by the way, I love this concept of,
[01:40:17.500 --> 01:40:19.980]   do you first look inside or outside?
[01:40:19.980 --> 01:40:22.420]   Do you listen to what's inside or outside first
[01:40:22.420 --> 01:40:26.860]   when something kind of arises emotionally outside you?
[01:40:26.860 --> 01:40:27.860]   Love, love, love that.
[01:40:27.860 --> 01:40:29.700]   It's something I'll have to explore.
[01:40:29.700 --> 01:40:34.700]   But if we don't do that,
[01:40:34.700 --> 01:40:37.660]   then you could see how projection would be very effective.
[01:40:37.660 --> 01:40:39.620]   And I'm not accusing anyone of using this
[01:40:39.620 --> 01:40:40.900]   in any kind of diabolical way.
[01:40:40.900 --> 01:40:42.340]   I think people just do it 'cause it worked
[01:40:42.340 --> 01:40:44.900]   and they're doing it 'cause they've always done it.
[01:40:44.900 --> 01:40:46.140]   But if somebody says, you know,
[01:40:46.140 --> 01:40:48.300]   like, you don't care about me as a friend,
[01:40:48.300 --> 01:40:51.980]   or, you know, telling someone how they feel
[01:40:51.980 --> 01:40:56.380]   is so very different than telling someone how we feel, duh.
[01:40:56.380 --> 01:40:57.300]   All right, it's kind of an obvious.
[01:40:57.300 --> 01:40:59.580]   And yet, once you start watching for projection,
[01:40:59.580 --> 01:41:00.820]   you see it all the time.
[01:41:00.820 --> 01:41:01.660]   - Yeah.
[01:41:01.660 --> 01:41:04.780]   - But not just at you, but like in between people.
[01:41:04.780 --> 01:41:05.620]   - Right.
[01:41:05.620 --> 01:41:07.020]   - Like, you know, like I know this stresses you out,
[01:41:07.020 --> 01:41:09.020]   but, you know, people start doing it all the time.
[01:41:09.020 --> 01:41:10.420]   And it's very interesting to see how people
[01:41:10.420 --> 01:41:12.540]   kind of divide into a couple of different groups on this,
[01:41:12.540 --> 01:41:15.740]   maybe two or more groups in terms of whether or not
[01:41:15.740 --> 01:41:17.780]   it affects them and if it gets in their head,
[01:41:17.780 --> 01:41:20.580]   or somehow they're like, no, no, it's ridiculous.
[01:41:20.580 --> 01:41:21.780]   I don't feel that way.
[01:41:21.780 --> 01:41:23.940]   And for me, it's very context specific.
[01:41:23.980 --> 01:41:27.860]   But I'd love your thoughts on projection,
[01:41:27.860 --> 01:41:31.820]   both towards kids and from kids.
[01:41:31.820 --> 01:41:34.820]   - So, all right, I'm gonna respond to that.
[01:41:34.820 --> 01:41:35.740]   And you just cut me off.
[01:41:35.740 --> 01:41:36.940]   You're like, Becky, that's not the direction
[01:41:36.940 --> 01:41:37.780]   I want you to go in.
[01:41:37.780 --> 01:41:40.860]   Because I guess MGI,
[01:41:40.860 --> 01:41:43.780]   which is I call most generous interpretation,
[01:41:43.780 --> 01:41:47.300]   is to me the embodiment of not what I do all the time.
[01:41:47.300 --> 01:41:49.140]   Definitely not, 'cause I'm imperfect.
[01:41:49.140 --> 01:41:51.100]   But what I think is just a useful framework
[01:41:51.100 --> 01:41:53.260]   to try to employ as much as possible.
[01:41:53.260 --> 01:41:57.060]   Because the idea of what is the most generous interpretation
[01:41:57.060 --> 01:41:59.460]   of someone's behavior, like projection,
[01:41:59.460 --> 01:42:01.940]   counteracts our very natural human tendency,
[01:42:01.940 --> 01:42:05.060]   which is just what is the least generous interpretation.
[01:42:05.060 --> 01:42:07.660]   Right, we all come up with the least generous interpretation
[01:42:07.660 --> 01:42:09.540]   of people's behavior all the time.
[01:42:09.540 --> 01:42:11.220]   And it's just quick, it's easy.
[01:42:11.220 --> 01:42:12.380]   And I think it's 'cause in our brain,
[01:42:12.380 --> 01:42:13.900]   if we see something bad or annoying,
[01:42:13.900 --> 01:42:16.780]   it's just easy to think that that's the whole, right?
[01:42:16.780 --> 01:42:18.180]   So I can't even tell you how many times
[01:42:18.180 --> 01:42:21.380]   every parent I know will say, my kid doesn't listen.
[01:42:21.380 --> 01:42:22.900]   They hit all the elevator buttons.
[01:42:22.900 --> 01:42:24.420]   They hit other people.
[01:42:24.420 --> 01:42:25.700]   And then I said, and I know what you're thinking,
[01:42:25.700 --> 01:42:26.540]   they're a sociopath.
[01:42:26.540 --> 01:42:27.860]   They're like, that's literally what I'm thinking.
[01:42:27.860 --> 01:42:29.180]   I was like, I know, I have that thought too.
[01:42:29.180 --> 01:42:30.020]   - You know, when I was a kid,
[01:42:30.020 --> 01:42:32.380]   I used to put every button in the elevator.
[01:42:32.380 --> 01:42:33.220]   - Right.
[01:42:33.220 --> 01:42:34.380]   - Does that mean I'm a sociopath?
[01:42:34.380 --> 01:42:36.460]   - No, it means you are a good kid
[01:42:36.460 --> 01:42:40.500]   who has not yet learned the skills to regulate urges.
[01:42:40.500 --> 01:42:41.340]   That's all it means.
[01:42:41.340 --> 01:42:43.340]   That would be the most generous interpretation.
[01:42:43.340 --> 01:42:44.740]   - They're there, you just wanna, no, I'm kidding.
[01:42:44.740 --> 01:42:45.740]   You just wanna push 'em.
[01:42:45.740 --> 01:42:46.580]   I'm joking. - You do.
[01:42:46.580 --> 01:42:47.420]   - I'm joking.
[01:42:47.420 --> 01:42:48.260]   - I have a kid like that too.
[01:42:48.260 --> 01:42:49.580]   He wants things for himself
[01:42:49.580 --> 01:42:52.060]   and he derives a lot of joy from things.
[01:42:52.060 --> 01:42:53.420]   Those types of kids are gonna do things.
[01:42:53.420 --> 01:42:56.260]   Okay, that's my resilient revel.
[01:42:56.260 --> 01:42:58.820]   Okay, but projection.
[01:42:58.820 --> 01:42:59.900]   Why am I bringing that up?
[01:42:59.900 --> 01:43:02.820]   So what's my most generous interpretation
[01:43:02.820 --> 01:43:05.260]   of why this projection would happen?
[01:43:05.260 --> 01:43:07.900]   Why would a kid say, you're mad at me?
[01:43:07.900 --> 01:43:10.740]   Or, you know, I can see how mad you are at me.
[01:43:10.740 --> 01:43:13.740]   Or why would someone even say in adulthood,
[01:43:13.740 --> 01:43:16.220]   you seem really, really stressed out, right?
[01:43:16.220 --> 01:43:19.140]   Again, the gazing in versus gazing out.
[01:43:19.140 --> 01:43:21.740]   I think it comes back to, in our childhoods,
[01:43:21.740 --> 01:43:24.540]   I mean, that's what often a lot comes back to,
[01:43:24.540 --> 01:43:30.060]   were we taught that we have an emotional life
[01:43:30.060 --> 01:43:32.700]   that lives inside of us?
[01:43:32.700 --> 01:43:36.700]   Then were we taught how to understand that emotional life?
[01:43:36.700 --> 01:43:38.980]   Then were we taught how to manage
[01:43:38.980 --> 01:43:41.420]   and cope with that whole emotional life?
[01:43:41.420 --> 01:43:43.020]   Most people were not.
[01:43:43.020 --> 01:43:47.060]   So it becomes this very, very complicated conundrum.
[01:43:47.060 --> 01:43:48.740]   The emotional life is happening inside me.
[01:43:48.740 --> 01:43:50.100]   Again, like you can't beat it.
[01:43:50.100 --> 01:43:53.140]   It's happening, our feelings, we can't get rid of them.
[01:43:53.140 --> 01:43:55.780]   And they're very powerful, they're sensations.
[01:43:55.780 --> 01:43:58.660]   But if your framework was always, you're getting punished,
[01:43:58.660 --> 01:44:00.820]   you're getting ridiculed, you're being a baby,
[01:44:00.820 --> 01:44:03.420]   then you develop a very conflictual relationship
[01:44:03.420 --> 01:44:04.260]   with your feelings.
[01:44:04.260 --> 01:44:05.860]   Like, they can't be real.
[01:44:05.860 --> 01:44:07.860]   They almost can't be mine.
[01:44:07.860 --> 01:44:10.540]   That's really what, they can't be mine.
[01:44:10.540 --> 01:44:13.900]   People like this often blame other people a lot
[01:44:13.900 --> 01:44:15.340]   for things they never did
[01:44:15.340 --> 01:44:17.020]   when they're really frustrated and upset.
[01:44:17.020 --> 01:44:18.860]   'Cause it's almost like, this can't be mine,
[01:44:18.860 --> 01:44:23.500]   so like, who did this feeling to me?
[01:44:23.500 --> 01:44:24.340]   You know?
[01:44:24.340 --> 01:44:25.500]   There's a lot of that in the world.
[01:44:25.500 --> 01:44:26.740]   A lot of that in the world.
[01:44:26.740 --> 01:44:28.820]   Who did this feeling to me?
[01:44:28.820 --> 01:44:31.140]   Who put this in me?
[01:44:31.140 --> 01:44:32.300]   Right?
[01:44:32.300 --> 01:44:36.380]   It's so fragile and so sad almost.
[01:44:36.380 --> 01:44:38.940]   And so, you know, toxic.
[01:44:38.940 --> 01:44:42.980]   But projection, in a way, is the only way
[01:44:42.980 --> 01:44:45.580]   that I can understand my emotional life.
[01:44:46.420 --> 01:44:51.220]   Is by imagining you having an emotional life.
[01:44:51.220 --> 01:44:53.020]   I don't know.
[01:44:53.020 --> 01:44:55.220]   Like, a lot of these things, I hear myself say this,
[01:44:55.220 --> 01:44:57.620]   I like, Mel, I was like, oh, that's,
[01:44:57.620 --> 01:44:59.180]   what a vulnerable way to go about the world.
[01:44:59.180 --> 01:45:01.780]   What an awful way to live in your body.
[01:45:01.780 --> 01:45:04.020]   That you're so overwhelmed
[01:45:04.020 --> 01:45:10.100]   and almost so self-abandoning
[01:45:10.100 --> 01:45:13.420]   of the information in your body
[01:45:13.420 --> 01:45:16.180]   that it must be someone else's.
[01:45:16.180 --> 01:45:17.020]   You know?
[01:45:17.020 --> 01:45:20.140]   So, that's what projection is, right?
[01:45:20.140 --> 01:45:23.700]   So, what do we do when we see it, right?
[01:45:23.700 --> 01:45:24.980]   I don't know, what's an example, right?
[01:45:24.980 --> 01:45:26.700]   Like, you're so stressed out.
[01:45:26.700 --> 01:45:29.140]   You've been so stressed and you're thinking,
[01:45:29.140 --> 01:45:30.140]   maybe you're thinking of partnership,
[01:45:30.140 --> 01:45:34.220]   like, I feel like you're the one who's stressed, right?
[01:45:34.220 --> 01:45:37.100]   Never helps in the heat of the moment to be right.
[01:45:37.100 --> 01:45:38.700]   I've tried it a million times.
[01:45:38.700 --> 01:45:39.540]   I don't know about you.
[01:45:39.540 --> 01:45:40.980]   - To be right in an argument?
[01:45:40.980 --> 01:45:42.340]   - To be right in a heated moment
[01:45:42.340 --> 01:45:44.220]   when you're like, I'm gonna be right.
[01:45:44.220 --> 01:45:46.700]   Not if you want an effective outcome, no.
[01:45:46.700 --> 01:45:49.340]   - No, but it's a very hard urge to resist.
[01:45:49.340 --> 01:45:50.780]   - It took me many years to learn,
[01:45:50.780 --> 01:45:54.740]   but someone taught it to me in one hour.
[01:45:54.740 --> 01:45:57.020]   I feel very grateful that she taught me this,
[01:45:57.020 --> 01:45:58.740]   that she didn't tell me to do it,
[01:45:58.740 --> 01:46:01.540]   but I just realized if you just, like,
[01:46:01.540 --> 01:46:04.620]   I don't have any word other than just, like, soften.
[01:46:04.620 --> 01:46:06.180]   If you just kind of, like,
[01:46:06.180 --> 01:46:10.980]   imagine becoming more like a noodle
[01:46:11.060 --> 01:46:14.740]   than, like, a rigid bar of iron.
[01:46:14.740 --> 01:46:16.380]   I just, like, go.
[01:46:16.380 --> 01:46:20.260]   And I actually, I think of the way that, like, my,
[01:46:20.260 --> 01:46:21.340]   he always comes up, but my,
[01:46:21.340 --> 01:46:22.860]   I had this bulldog mastiff, Costello,
[01:46:22.860 --> 01:46:23.780]   and he was, like, super lazy.
[01:46:23.780 --> 01:46:25.580]   The contract with him was he would protect me
[01:46:25.580 --> 01:46:29.540]   with his entire life, but if my life wasn't on the line,
[01:46:29.540 --> 01:46:31.140]   noodle.
[01:46:31.140 --> 01:46:34.860]   And I remember just thinking, like, if I just go there,
[01:46:34.860 --> 01:46:37.940]   then the basic contract of, like, I care about you,
[01:46:37.940 --> 01:46:40.100]   I'll protect you with my life is still there.
[01:46:40.100 --> 01:46:41.620]   So I guess I learned it from my bulldog,
[01:46:41.620 --> 01:46:43.980]   but it sort of played out in a romantic relationship.
[01:46:43.980 --> 01:46:45.020]   And it was just really beautiful.
[01:46:45.020 --> 01:46:47.020]   It was one of the best things I learned
[01:46:47.020 --> 01:46:49.180]   from the two of them.
[01:46:49.180 --> 01:46:50.700]   - Yeah.
[01:46:50.700 --> 01:46:54.060]   - Is how I just, like, literally, like, physically soften.
[01:46:54.060 --> 01:46:56.140]   Then, like, everything becomes apparent.
[01:46:56.140 --> 01:46:57.380]   Somehow, for me, it allows me
[01:46:57.380 --> 01:46:59.940]   to get back into my own eggshell.
[01:46:59.940 --> 01:47:00.780]   - Yep.
[01:47:00.780 --> 01:47:02.100]   - But still have optics out.
[01:47:02.100 --> 01:47:02.940]   Now, that's me.
[01:47:02.940 --> 01:47:03.860]   I realize it's, you know,
[01:47:03.860 --> 01:47:05.380]   and that doesn't mean in the heat of the moment,
[01:47:05.380 --> 01:47:07.580]   I'm not, like, feeling like I want to be reactive.
[01:47:07.580 --> 01:47:08.420]   - Right.
[01:47:08.420 --> 01:47:11.300]   - The physical change to my body.
[01:47:11.300 --> 01:47:12.140]   - Yeah.
[01:47:12.140 --> 01:47:13.780]   - Self-directed physical change to my body
[01:47:13.780 --> 01:47:16.340]   is what just kind of, like, changed everything.
[01:47:16.340 --> 01:47:18.460]   - Yeah, and I think, you know, this is so true
[01:47:18.460 --> 01:47:20.300]   in relationships, definitely at work,
[01:47:20.300 --> 01:47:22.380]   and definitely in parenting,
[01:47:22.380 --> 01:47:27.380]   is you don't have to represent everything you believe in
[01:47:27.380 --> 01:47:29.940]   in, like, a given moment.
[01:47:29.940 --> 01:47:32.180]   Like, we're not so fragile, like, to be like,
[01:47:32.180 --> 01:47:34.860]   no, and you're projecting, like, I have time.
[01:47:34.860 --> 01:47:37.260]   Like, this is a heated moment.
[01:47:37.260 --> 01:47:38.900]   I can kind of chill out.
[01:47:38.900 --> 01:47:40.380]   You're so stressed, and I think I'm not.
[01:47:40.380 --> 01:47:41.220]   I think there's projection.
[01:47:41.220 --> 01:47:43.980]   I might say, like, oh, I am?
[01:47:43.980 --> 01:47:46.140]   Well, who cares?
[01:47:46.140 --> 01:47:47.860]   Just, like, get through the moment, right?
[01:47:47.860 --> 01:47:49.780]   And then maybe after, if it feels important,
[01:47:49.780 --> 01:47:51.860]   I say, I feel like this thing happens sometimes
[01:47:51.860 --> 01:47:53.580]   where when you're stressed, you say, I'm stressed.
[01:47:53.580 --> 01:47:54.420]   I don't know.
[01:47:54.420 --> 01:47:56.020]   Like, let's talk about this.
[01:47:56.020 --> 01:47:57.940]   That's when that happens.
[01:47:57.940 --> 01:48:01.980]   I think this is really true with kids, too, right?
[01:48:01.980 --> 01:48:03.260]   This happened the other day.
[01:48:03.260 --> 01:48:05.300]   And in some ways, it's the same strategy,
[01:48:05.300 --> 01:48:08.380]   which I jokingly on Instagram called do nothing
[01:48:08.380 --> 01:48:10.620]   with a capital D and a capital N,
[01:48:10.620 --> 01:48:12.660]   because so many times in hard situations,
[01:48:12.660 --> 01:48:14.300]   especially when you're accused of something
[01:48:14.300 --> 01:48:16.900]   that's not true, people will say to parents,
[01:48:16.900 --> 01:48:19.620]   oh, so you're just gonna do nothing?
[01:48:19.620 --> 01:48:21.820]   Well, I'm like, take away the just.
[01:48:21.820 --> 01:48:23.940]   Like, doing nothing in a heated moment
[01:48:23.940 --> 01:48:26.460]   is a very sophisticated technique,
[01:48:26.460 --> 01:48:27.580]   because really what you're saying
[01:48:27.580 --> 01:48:29.700]   is you're doing nothing on the outside,
[01:48:29.700 --> 01:48:31.820]   and you're being an adult
[01:48:31.820 --> 01:48:34.180]   and managing your feelings on the inside.
[01:48:34.180 --> 01:48:35.020]   - Amen to that.
[01:48:35.020 --> 01:48:39.060]   - Versus doing nothing on the inside
[01:48:39.060 --> 01:48:41.700]   and just yelling or reacting on the outside.
[01:48:41.700 --> 01:48:44.100]   So the other day, my son came to me
[01:48:44.100 --> 01:48:45.180]   before school, my youngest,
[01:48:45.180 --> 01:48:47.380]   and he goes, my sweatshirt's still dirty.
[01:48:47.380 --> 01:48:49.100]   And I was like, oh, man.
[01:48:49.100 --> 01:48:51.140]   He goes, you promised me
[01:48:51.140 --> 01:48:53.300]   you would wash my sweatshirt before school.
[01:48:53.300 --> 01:48:57.540]   Between us, he never asked me that, okay?
[01:48:57.540 --> 01:48:59.780]   And here's my fork in the road.
[01:48:59.780 --> 01:49:02.380]   It's like, we all know what it would be easier.
[01:49:02.380 --> 01:49:05.060]   What I, by the way, I wanted to say back to him,
[01:49:05.060 --> 01:49:10.060]   99% of me was about to go, you never asked me.
[01:49:10.060 --> 01:49:11.580]   And then he's like, I did.
[01:49:11.580 --> 01:49:12.420]   No, you didn't.
[01:49:12.420 --> 01:49:13.620]   And now you're lying to me.
[01:49:13.620 --> 01:49:15.460]   And all of a sudden, it's like, okay.
[01:49:15.460 --> 01:49:17.380]   You know what he was saying to me?
[01:49:17.380 --> 01:49:20.700]   I wish my sweatshirt was clean.
[01:49:20.700 --> 01:49:22.020]   That's what he was saying.
[01:49:22.020 --> 01:49:23.540]   That's what we're all saying.
[01:49:23.540 --> 01:49:25.820]   And I'm so upset about it.
[01:49:25.820 --> 01:49:29.140]   The feeling is so big that it's like too overwhelming
[01:49:29.140 --> 01:49:32.060]   in this moment as a seven-year-old to be mine.
[01:49:32.060 --> 01:49:35.180]   So, like, I kind of have to make it your fault
[01:49:35.180 --> 01:49:37.260]   to try to make sense of it.
[01:49:37.260 --> 01:49:38.940]   So what did I do in the moment?
[01:49:38.940 --> 01:49:41.100]   I literally did nothing.
[01:49:41.100 --> 01:49:42.180]   What'd I do?
[01:49:42.180 --> 01:49:44.540]   You promised me you'd wash my sweatshirt.
[01:49:44.540 --> 01:49:45.580]   And I went like this.
[01:49:45.580 --> 01:49:49.660]   I kind of was just like looking at him
[01:49:49.660 --> 01:49:51.340]   like I knew what it was like to want something
[01:49:51.340 --> 01:49:53.260]   and not be able to have it.
[01:49:53.260 --> 01:49:55.100]   And he's like, you did.
[01:49:55.100 --> 01:49:56.940]   In the moment, I go, I did.
[01:49:56.940 --> 01:50:01.460]   Oh, that sweatshirt is dirty.
[01:50:01.460 --> 01:50:03.220]   You really wanted it to be clean.
[01:50:03.220 --> 01:50:06.700]   Just kind of, and he's like, I really did.
[01:50:06.700 --> 01:50:08.340]   I was like, oh, that's the worst.
[01:50:08.340 --> 01:50:10.220]   Not joking.
[01:50:10.220 --> 01:50:12.780]   And then he, at the end, like five minutes later,
[01:50:12.780 --> 01:50:13.780]   I didn't say anything.
[01:50:13.780 --> 01:50:14.820]   He got another sweatshirt.
[01:50:14.820 --> 01:50:15.660]   We moved on.
[01:50:15.660 --> 01:50:17.900]   I didn't say, I wasn't going to like ruin the moment
[01:50:17.900 --> 01:50:21.220]   by being like, see, you could cope or you never asked me.
[01:50:21.220 --> 01:50:23.580]   But I think in both these moments,
[01:50:23.580 --> 01:50:25.020]   whether someone's saying you're stressed
[01:50:25.020 --> 01:50:27.340]   or my kid's accusing me,
[01:50:27.340 --> 01:50:29.380]   I think about this a lot in parenting.
[01:50:29.380 --> 01:50:32.340]   I don't have to prove my parenting in a moment.
[01:50:32.340 --> 01:50:33.860]   I don't have to prove it to my kid.
[01:50:33.860 --> 01:50:34.700]   I don't have to prove it
[01:50:34.700 --> 01:50:36.060]   'cause my mother-in-law is watching.
[01:50:36.060 --> 01:50:41.060]   Like I trust myself way more than I trust one single moment
[01:50:41.060 --> 01:50:44.140]   to represent everything about me.
[01:50:44.140 --> 01:50:47.060]   And I think when we can gain a little bit of that confidence
[01:50:47.060 --> 01:50:49.660]   we have a lot more freedom to just be effective
[01:50:49.660 --> 01:50:54.100]   and to also know there's a moment to do nothing.
[01:50:54.100 --> 01:50:55.460]   And then if something's a chronic issue,
[01:50:55.460 --> 01:50:57.700]   if my son's chronically blaming me,
[01:50:57.700 --> 01:51:00.260]   when things are less heated, I'm going to say to him,
[01:51:00.260 --> 01:51:03.060]   you know, something and, you know, a calm moment.
[01:51:03.060 --> 01:51:06.700]   - Those are super important and novel approaches
[01:51:06.700 --> 01:51:10.500]   to things that I think everybody deals with,
[01:51:10.500 --> 01:51:11.980]   kids in the picture or not.
[01:51:11.980 --> 01:51:16.140]   My audience sometimes gets angry with me
[01:51:16.140 --> 01:51:19.520]   when I ask very long extended questions,
[01:51:19.520 --> 01:51:22.300]   but could I just share with you
[01:51:22.300 --> 01:51:24.860]   something I learned about an experiment?
[01:51:24.860 --> 01:51:28.140]   'Cause I think it blew my mind.
[01:51:28.140 --> 01:51:29.040]   I won't take long.
[01:51:29.040 --> 01:51:32.540]   There's a imaging experiment.
[01:51:32.540 --> 01:51:35.140]   So you put people in a scanner, they image their brain,
[01:51:35.140 --> 01:51:37.180]   see which areas are active, fMRI.
[01:51:37.180 --> 01:51:39.940]   There's a really wild experiment
[01:51:39.940 --> 01:51:41.780]   where they bring people in for the scan.
[01:51:41.780 --> 01:51:43.700]   They don't tell them why they're there
[01:51:43.700 --> 01:51:45.980]   and they tell them they're going to be paid $30
[01:51:45.980 --> 01:51:48.940]   and they set out three $10 bills.
[01:51:48.940 --> 01:51:50.900]   Maybe you know this experiment, I don't know.
[01:51:50.900 --> 01:51:53.740]   Then they go into the scanner and then they come out
[01:51:53.740 --> 01:51:54.900]   and then the researcher leaves
[01:51:54.900 --> 01:51:56.500]   and there's a discussion, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:51:56.500 --> 01:51:58.620]   And at some point, one of the $10 bills
[01:51:58.620 --> 01:52:00.940]   is removed by the researcher.
[01:52:00.940 --> 01:52:04.220]   And people are told at the end of the experiment,
[01:52:04.220 --> 01:52:07.860]   you took one of the $10 bills.
[01:52:07.860 --> 01:52:11.580]   And they're like, no, I didn't because they didn't.
[01:52:11.580 --> 01:52:13.780]   Nobody says you're right.
[01:52:13.780 --> 01:52:18.540]   But then they re-image them
[01:52:18.540 --> 01:52:21.740]   and they compare that to a condition in other subjects
[01:52:21.740 --> 01:52:24.420]   where people actually did a little sneaky steal
[01:52:24.420 --> 01:52:25.860]   during a money game.
[01:52:25.860 --> 01:52:28.660]   And the same areas of the brain light up
[01:52:28.660 --> 01:52:33.420]   that we think are associated with guilt.
[01:52:33.420 --> 01:52:37.300]   In other words, if somebody is told that they did something,
[01:52:37.300 --> 01:52:39.100]   even if they know they didn't,
[01:52:39.100 --> 01:52:41.900]   there are aspects of brain circuitry
[01:52:41.900 --> 01:52:45.060]   that reflect a "feeling of guilt."
[01:52:45.060 --> 01:52:47.740]   It's like it introduces this question about reality.
[01:52:47.740 --> 01:52:50.020]   And so they can know with 100% certainty,
[01:52:50.020 --> 01:52:51.860]   you can know with 100% certainty
[01:52:51.860 --> 01:52:53.820]   that you did not do something.
[01:52:53.820 --> 01:52:55.700]   And yet it starts to introduce these questions
[01:52:55.700 --> 01:52:57.980]   about how you gauge reality.
[01:52:57.980 --> 01:53:00.620]   Simply because somebody you just met a few minutes earlier,
[01:53:00.620 --> 01:53:02.580]   yes, in a position of authority,
[01:53:02.580 --> 01:53:05.420]   they're the researcher, you're the subject, et cetera,
[01:53:05.420 --> 01:53:06.940]   told you that you did it.
[01:53:06.940 --> 01:53:09.100]   I think this has huge implications
[01:53:09.100 --> 01:53:10.580]   for parent-child relationships,
[01:53:10.580 --> 01:53:12.740]   for romantic relationships, workplace relationships,
[01:53:12.740 --> 01:53:15.900]   for real bias in the outside world.
[01:53:15.900 --> 01:53:17.460]   You can imagine if you're told your whole life
[01:53:17.460 --> 01:53:18.620]   that you're a piece of garbage
[01:53:18.620 --> 01:53:21.100]   or that you're part of a bad group or something like this.
[01:53:21.100 --> 01:53:22.500]   I'm not trying to get political here.
[01:53:22.500 --> 01:53:24.180]   You could come to believe that
[01:53:24.180 --> 01:53:26.340]   at a level that is biological,
[01:53:26.340 --> 01:53:29.220]   even if cognitively doesn't make sense.
[01:53:29.220 --> 01:53:34.140]   So this is where I think about this challenging boundary
[01:53:34.140 --> 01:53:36.980]   between knowing what we know, being a container,
[01:53:36.980 --> 01:53:38.260]   staying in our frame,
[01:53:38.260 --> 01:53:40.340]   pick your favorite lingo around this,
[01:53:40.340 --> 01:53:44.980]   and the fact that words and the emotions of other people
[01:53:44.980 --> 01:53:49.980]   really do have the capacity to rewire us on the inside.
[01:53:49.980 --> 01:53:53.620]   - You know, a question I'd have about that study,
[01:53:53.620 --> 01:53:57.900]   I'd be really curious if there was variation among subjects
[01:53:57.900 --> 01:54:00.780]   where some people that guilt part lit up a lot more.
[01:54:00.780 --> 01:54:03.460]   - Okay, so you reminded me, so this is the wild part.
[01:54:03.460 --> 01:54:08.220]   The distribution of kind of like people who have this,
[01:54:08.220 --> 01:54:10.220]   by the way, folks,
[01:54:10.220 --> 01:54:11.940]   there aren't single brain areas for whole emotions,
[01:54:11.940 --> 01:54:14.700]   but let's just, for sake of simplicity here,
[01:54:14.700 --> 01:54:16.860]   that have the guilt area activated
[01:54:16.860 --> 01:54:18.700]   even when they didn't take the money.
[01:54:18.700 --> 01:54:20.220]   The entire population of subjects
[01:54:20.220 --> 01:54:21.700]   doesn't experience that to the same degree.
[01:54:21.700 --> 01:54:24.020]   You have these people for whom
[01:54:24.020 --> 01:54:27.140]   it's very high amplitude response and others who aren't.
[01:54:27.140 --> 01:54:28.140]   Now I don't recall,
[01:54:28.140 --> 01:54:29.500]   and I need to go back and look at the study,
[01:54:29.500 --> 01:54:31.660]   if it divided according to male, female,
[01:54:31.660 --> 01:54:34.300]   because earlier you said that this tendency-
[01:54:34.300 --> 01:54:36.500]   - I would bet a million dollars
[01:54:36.500 --> 01:54:37.860]   that if I got to know those people,
[01:54:37.860 --> 01:54:40.660]   the people who really light up
[01:54:40.660 --> 01:54:43.100]   have a lot of focus on gazing out
[01:54:43.100 --> 01:54:44.820]   and determining their inner reality
[01:54:44.820 --> 01:54:46.980]   by what other people think about them.
[01:54:46.980 --> 01:54:49.340]   And the people who did not light up as much
[01:54:49.340 --> 01:54:50.820]   are the people who gaze in
[01:54:50.820 --> 01:54:54.140]   and have a deep sense of themselves,
[01:54:54.140 --> 01:54:58.380]   even in the face of kind of a lack of validation
[01:54:58.380 --> 01:55:00.060]   or even in the face of criticism.
[01:55:00.060 --> 01:55:03.500]   I would bet my money on that psychological kind of,
[01:55:03.500 --> 01:55:05.180]   is that a moderator or a mediator?
[01:55:05.180 --> 01:55:06.380]   I don't know, you tell me.
[01:55:06.380 --> 01:55:08.060]   So I'd be very curious about that.
[01:55:08.060 --> 01:55:09.980]   - Great, well, I have no skin in the game.
[01:55:09.980 --> 01:55:12.140]   Like I didn't run this study and I'll go back
[01:55:12.140 --> 01:55:12.980]   and check it out. - I want to know.
[01:55:12.980 --> 01:55:14.460]   - And it's a collection of studies.
[01:55:14.460 --> 01:55:15.700]   And I hadn't known about this.
[01:55:15.700 --> 01:55:17.620]   I mean, I read the neuroscience literature,
[01:55:17.620 --> 01:55:18.460]   but I hadn't known about this.
[01:55:18.460 --> 01:55:23.460]   I find it like a complete yes, of course, on the one hand,
[01:55:23.460 --> 01:55:25.900]   and also super surprising on the other.
[01:55:25.900 --> 01:55:27.660]   - Yeah. - And just oh, so cool.
[01:55:27.660 --> 01:55:28.500]   - Yeah.
[01:55:28.500 --> 01:55:30.180]   - In the sense that it's informative.
[01:55:30.180 --> 01:55:32.740]   And it's making me think that some people
[01:55:32.740 --> 01:55:35.100]   really need to do the work of paying more attention
[01:55:35.100 --> 01:55:36.620]   to other people's emotions
[01:55:36.620 --> 01:55:38.100]   and feeling them a little bit more.
[01:55:38.100 --> 01:55:41.380]   And other people probably need to do the exact opposite.
[01:55:41.380 --> 01:55:42.620]   - That's exactly right.
[01:55:42.620 --> 01:55:45.740]   And to me, like I always, I say this to people I manage,
[01:55:45.740 --> 01:55:48.420]   I say like, I think about this in general with adults.
[01:55:48.420 --> 01:55:52.380]   I think such an empowering thing as an adult
[01:55:52.380 --> 01:55:55.940]   is just to know where you are in any given scale.
[01:55:55.940 --> 01:55:58.660]   So for me, as a leader, I'm always gas.
[01:55:58.660 --> 01:55:59.620]   I'm like, go, go, go.
[01:55:59.620 --> 01:56:01.100]   We can do this, we can get this accomplished.
[01:56:01.100 --> 01:56:03.980]   I'm probably like pretty far in that.
[01:56:03.980 --> 01:56:06.820]   And given that, I know it's really important for me
[01:56:06.820 --> 01:56:09.060]   to have people around me who sometimes say like,
[01:56:09.060 --> 01:56:11.100]   whoa, let's look at this first, right?
[01:56:11.100 --> 01:56:16.380]   I also know that sometimes if I do have a like,
[01:56:16.380 --> 01:56:17.700]   maybe I should slow this down.
[01:56:17.700 --> 01:56:19.220]   I should like really listen to that
[01:56:19.220 --> 01:56:20.660]   'cause that's like not, right?
[01:56:20.660 --> 01:56:23.940]   But knowing where I am on a scale is important.
[01:56:23.940 --> 01:56:26.380]   I talk about someone that I manage
[01:56:26.380 --> 01:56:28.180]   who she really needs to be more direct
[01:56:28.180 --> 01:56:29.180]   with the people she manages.
[01:56:29.180 --> 01:56:31.660]   Just like, you know, like sometimes ask questions
[01:56:31.660 --> 01:56:33.020]   when she really wants statements
[01:56:33.020 --> 01:56:35.580]   and can have a little higher standard.
[01:56:35.580 --> 01:56:38.460]   And I think it's helpful to know where she is in that scale
[01:56:38.460 --> 01:56:39.940]   because I remember saying like,
[01:56:39.940 --> 01:56:42.180]   I want you to go as far as you can toward the other direction
[01:56:42.180 --> 01:56:43.460]   without being disrespectful
[01:56:43.460 --> 01:56:47.020]   because it's almost impossible to do that, right?
[01:56:47.020 --> 01:56:49.220]   And so I think for adults to know,
[01:56:49.220 --> 01:56:51.460]   let's say I gaze in or I more gaze out,
[01:56:51.460 --> 01:56:53.260]   neither is better or worse.
[01:56:53.260 --> 01:56:56.300]   Probably again, mental health and resilience
[01:56:56.300 --> 01:56:58.860]   is about having just a lack of rigidity.
[01:56:58.860 --> 01:57:00.860]   And so to say, what is my starting point?
[01:57:00.860 --> 01:57:02.820]   Like anyone listening, what is my starting point?
[01:57:02.820 --> 01:57:04.140]   There's no morality.
[01:57:04.140 --> 01:57:06.420]   It's literally not better or worse.
[01:57:06.420 --> 01:57:08.020]   It just gives me information
[01:57:08.020 --> 01:57:11.380]   about which direction to experiment with.
[01:57:11.380 --> 01:57:14.060]   And I like to make this a concrete experiment, right?
[01:57:14.060 --> 01:57:16.700]   So let's say you are someone
[01:57:16.700 --> 01:57:19.060]   who tends to gaze out before you gaze in.
[01:57:19.060 --> 01:57:21.500]   And you're always like, I can't do this thing I want to do
[01:57:21.500 --> 01:57:23.100]   because it would inconvenience someone.
[01:57:23.100 --> 01:57:24.820]   I told this story the other day on my Instagram
[01:57:24.820 --> 01:57:27.100]   and people went bananas about it.
[01:57:27.100 --> 01:57:29.580]   I was at the airport
[01:57:29.580 --> 01:57:32.060]   and I got a cup of coffee in the morning.
[01:57:32.060 --> 01:57:33.340]   And I like my coffee with just like
[01:57:33.340 --> 01:57:35.100]   a really little bit of milk, right?
[01:57:35.100 --> 01:57:37.900]   And I know to specify it if I'm asking someone else.
[01:57:37.900 --> 01:57:38.940]   So I went to the counter and I said,
[01:57:38.940 --> 01:57:40.980]   hey, can I get a medium coffee?
[01:57:40.980 --> 01:57:43.180]   Not black, just a little, little bit of milk,
[01:57:43.180 --> 01:57:44.060]   pretty close to black.
[01:57:44.060 --> 01:57:45.100]   Sure, no problem.
[01:57:45.100 --> 01:57:47.060]   I go, I wait in line, then it's on the counter.
[01:57:47.060 --> 01:57:51.020]   I pick it up, Becky, and it's like light as can be.
[01:57:51.020 --> 01:57:56.340]   I got back on line.
[01:57:56.340 --> 01:57:57.860]   I brought the coffee.
[01:57:57.860 --> 01:57:59.900]   And I said, hey, I asked for this.
[01:57:59.900 --> 01:58:02.020]   I know there's a lot of people probably got lost.
[01:58:02.020 --> 01:58:03.740]   I asked for this, you know, darker.
[01:58:03.740 --> 01:58:05.500]   Could you pour out a good amount of this
[01:58:05.500 --> 01:58:07.300]   and then refill it with coffee?
[01:58:07.300 --> 01:58:09.460]   The person, you know, who knows if it could have gone
[01:58:09.460 --> 01:58:12.220]   differently a different day, should, oh, right, no problem.
[01:58:12.220 --> 01:58:13.060]   Here you go.
[01:58:13.060 --> 01:58:16.780]   This happens with things that are so much bigger than coffee,
[01:58:16.780 --> 01:58:19.100]   but the coffee example is such a good one
[01:58:19.100 --> 01:58:22.780]   because what I'm doing in that moment is I'm saying,
[01:58:22.780 --> 01:58:25.900]   I'm allowed to have my coffee the way I wanted it
[01:58:25.900 --> 01:58:29.940]   and asked for it, even if it's awkward
[01:58:29.940 --> 01:58:32.820]   or inconveniences the other person.
[01:58:32.820 --> 01:58:35.060]   Now, can people be on the opposite extreme?
[01:58:35.060 --> 01:58:37.140]   And can someone hear this and be like,
[01:58:37.140 --> 01:58:41.580]   I probably need to do a little bit less of my own needs.
[01:58:41.580 --> 01:58:42.420]   That's what I'm saying.
[01:58:42.420 --> 01:58:43.300]   You have to know who you are.
[01:58:43.300 --> 01:58:46.380]   But what I have found at least with moms
[01:58:46.380 --> 01:58:52.420]   is the idea of, ooh, you know, I asked for almond milk
[01:58:52.420 --> 01:58:54.420]   and this is whole milk.
[01:58:54.420 --> 01:58:57.220]   Or I used to give my clients this experiment
[01:58:57.220 --> 01:58:58.140]   who had this struggle.
[01:58:58.140 --> 01:59:00.500]   I said, I want you at the grocery store.
[01:59:01.980 --> 01:59:04.340]   After you're basically done checking out,
[01:59:04.340 --> 01:59:06.860]   to say, oh, you know what?
[01:59:06.860 --> 01:59:08.900]   I actually don't need those paper towels.
[01:59:08.900 --> 01:59:10.180]   I can't even tell you.
[01:59:10.180 --> 01:59:11.620]   People are like, I can't do that.
[01:59:11.620 --> 01:59:12.700]   I can't like return it.
[01:59:12.700 --> 01:59:14.100]   Like, oh my goodness.
[01:59:14.100 --> 01:59:15.140]   It was like a panic attack.
[01:59:15.140 --> 01:59:18.580]   And the panic, the panic feeling is
[01:59:18.580 --> 01:59:20.580]   that would be a completely new circuit.
[01:59:20.580 --> 01:59:24.060]   That would be me saying, I'm willing to do something
[01:59:24.060 --> 01:59:25.060]   to meet my own needs.
[01:59:25.060 --> 01:59:27.080]   I actually don't need that paper towel.
[01:59:28.020 --> 01:59:31.580]   Even though it could get an eye roll
[01:59:31.580 --> 01:59:35.540]   or inconvenience temporarily someone else.
[01:59:35.540 --> 01:59:36.980]   Those little experiments.
[01:59:36.980 --> 01:59:38.340]   And it might be the opposite.
[01:59:38.340 --> 01:59:41.660]   It might be saying to my partner tonight, you know what?
[01:59:41.660 --> 01:59:44.020]   We always sit down and talk about my work.
[01:59:44.020 --> 01:59:46.820]   And I actually did have a stressful day, but you know what?
[01:59:46.820 --> 01:59:49.180]   I wanna hear about your day.
[01:59:49.180 --> 01:59:50.020]   You go first.
[01:59:50.020 --> 01:59:51.060]   That's also an experiment.
[01:59:51.060 --> 01:59:53.100]   And for someone who's on that extreme,
[01:59:53.100 --> 01:59:54.420]   they're gonna also have a panic attack.
[01:59:54.420 --> 01:59:56.860]   They're gonna be like, this is deeply uncomfortable.
[01:59:56.860 --> 01:59:58.900]   But just knowing where you are in the spectrum
[01:59:58.900 --> 02:00:01.020]   gives you the information you need
[02:00:01.020 --> 02:00:02.580]   to get a little bit of balance.
[02:00:02.580 --> 02:00:05.220]   - Yeah, I think there's clearly a distribution
[02:00:05.220 --> 02:00:08.740]   and whether or not it's a binary distribution
[02:00:08.740 --> 02:00:11.540]   or it's kind of like a normal distribution, I don't know.
[02:00:11.540 --> 02:00:13.660]   But there's clearly variance here
[02:00:13.660 --> 02:00:14.860]   from one person to the next.
[02:00:14.860 --> 02:00:17.740]   And probably even depending on how well rested we are
[02:00:17.740 --> 02:00:18.580]   and all the rest.
[02:00:18.580 --> 02:00:21.520]   But I do think that we do kind of fall into phenotypes
[02:00:21.520 --> 02:00:25.620]   of prone to reacting to other people's emotions
[02:00:25.620 --> 02:00:28.140]   without hearing and listening to
[02:00:28.140 --> 02:00:31.740]   and responding to ours first, like truly ours first
[02:00:31.740 --> 02:00:34.540]   versus people who are just really out there.
[02:00:34.540 --> 02:00:36.220]   I realize it's very different
[02:00:36.220 --> 02:00:37.460]   than any other kind of relationship.
[02:00:37.460 --> 02:00:39.220]   But when I first went from being a postdoc
[02:00:39.220 --> 02:00:40.660]   to having my own laboratory,
[02:00:40.660 --> 02:00:41.700]   the chair in my department,
[02:00:41.700 --> 02:00:43.980]   my chairman in one department anyway, he said,
[02:00:43.980 --> 02:00:46.020]   you know, you should get a great big desk
[02:00:46.020 --> 02:00:47.900]   that's like really thick.
[02:00:47.900 --> 02:00:50.140]   I was like, yeah, like why?
[02:00:50.140 --> 02:00:50.960]   I mean, I get it.
[02:00:50.960 --> 02:00:52.060]   You don't wanna be sitting like right next
[02:00:52.060 --> 02:00:54.100]   to your employees or something, but like why?
[02:00:54.100 --> 02:00:56.180]   So that, and he goes, so that when they cry,
[02:00:56.180 --> 02:00:59.260]   you won't feel like you need to cry or take care of them.
[02:00:59.260 --> 02:01:02.620]   You'll just slide the Kleenex across the desk.
[02:01:02.620 --> 02:01:04.540]   And I was like, are you kidding?
[02:01:04.540 --> 02:01:05.380]   And he's like, no.
[02:01:05.380 --> 02:01:10.380]   And then years later, I looked back and I realized,
[02:01:10.380 --> 02:01:12.020]   I understood what he was saying.
[02:01:12.020 --> 02:01:13.120]   I mean, he didn't know me at all,
[02:01:13.120 --> 02:01:15.120]   but he was just saying probably something about himself,
[02:01:15.120 --> 02:01:17.820]   which is people are gonna come into your office.
[02:01:17.820 --> 02:01:19.140]   They're gonna cry.
[02:01:19.140 --> 02:01:20.380]   It does happen.
[02:01:20.380 --> 02:01:23.620]   And you're going to need to be the boss,
[02:01:23.620 --> 02:01:26.180]   which is to be supportive and empathic,
[02:01:26.180 --> 02:01:27.500]   but like you can't get pulled into it
[02:01:27.500 --> 02:01:29.460]   because they might be crying about something
[02:01:29.460 --> 02:01:30.700]   they don't like about the lab
[02:01:30.700 --> 02:01:32.740]   or about something not happening the way they want it.
[02:01:32.740 --> 02:01:35.340]   I mean, who could imagine any other reason to cry
[02:01:35.340 --> 02:01:37.860]   in your boss's office, but maybe they have a family issue
[02:01:37.860 --> 02:01:41.140]   and, you know, so you have to remember you're the boss.
[02:01:41.140 --> 02:01:43.900]   And I thought, oh, that's interesting.
[02:01:43.900 --> 02:01:46.940]   I ended up with a desk that was kind of medium in width,
[02:01:46.940 --> 02:01:49.180]   but I think that nowadays there's a lot more
[02:01:50.660 --> 02:01:52.300]   kind of bleeding of roles.
[02:01:52.300 --> 02:01:56.140]   And, you know, it used to be that everyone
[02:01:56.140 --> 02:01:57.820]   got really dressed up for work.
[02:01:57.820 --> 02:02:01.220]   Now dressing down is like common in certain circumstances
[02:02:01.220 --> 02:02:02.060]   and not others.
[02:02:02.060 --> 02:02:05.800]   I think that there's a lot of kind of lack of clarity
[02:02:05.800 --> 02:02:10.800]   about, here we go again, you know, power and authority,
[02:02:10.800 --> 02:02:13.980]   but also kind of staying in our own frame
[02:02:13.980 --> 02:02:15.740]   versus taking on someone else's frame.
[02:02:15.740 --> 02:02:16.580]   - Yeah.
[02:02:16.580 --> 02:02:18.720]   - You know, I have a friend who runs a pretty large business
[02:02:18.720 --> 02:02:20.420]   and he did the same experiment that you did
[02:02:20.420 --> 02:02:23.580]   of asking people, you know, how he could do better.
[02:02:23.580 --> 02:02:26.540]   But first he unfortunately made the mistake
[02:02:26.540 --> 02:02:29.260]   of asking people how they felt about being there.
[02:02:29.260 --> 02:02:32.000]   And they ended up making one of these emotion clouds
[02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:33.900]   where they took, everyone filled out a thing
[02:02:33.900 --> 02:02:36.160]   and wrote what the most dominant emotions were.
[02:02:36.160 --> 02:02:39.300]   And then he told this story, like, call me late at night.
[02:02:39.300 --> 02:02:42.060]   He sits down and they're gonna present this as data
[02:02:42.060 --> 02:02:43.380]   in front of everybody.
[02:02:43.380 --> 02:02:45.100]   And this emotion cloud comes up
[02:02:45.100 --> 02:02:49.060]   and the biggest bubble in the middle just says stress.
[02:02:49.060 --> 02:02:51.380]   And he was mortified, right?
[02:02:51.380 --> 02:02:52.700]   But he learned that they all feel
[02:02:52.700 --> 02:02:54.400]   really, really, really stressed.
[02:02:54.400 --> 02:02:58.620]   That sort of exercise would never have happened
[02:02:58.620 --> 02:03:00.160]   10, 15 years ago.
[02:03:00.160 --> 02:03:01.000]   - Yeah.
[02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.260]   - It's like, yeah, like I won't say what profession
[02:03:03.260 --> 02:03:04.860]   he's in for sake of privacy, but like,
[02:03:04.860 --> 02:03:08.180]   it's a profession where stress is part of the process
[02:03:08.180 --> 02:03:10.900]   and you don't kind of get the certificate at the end,
[02:03:10.900 --> 02:03:12.900]   so to speak, if you don't experience stress.
[02:03:12.900 --> 02:03:14.460]   - But this actually relates to what we started with
[02:03:14.460 --> 02:03:17.560]   in a way, I'm gonna circle it back there, which is,
[02:03:18.380 --> 02:03:20.580]   and 'cause I hear this a lot, you know,
[02:03:20.580 --> 02:03:23.140]   ugh, kind of some kids these days,
[02:03:23.140 --> 02:03:26.340]   they don't know how to tolerate stress
[02:03:26.340 --> 02:03:28.020]   or they're always overwhelmed.
[02:03:28.020 --> 02:03:31.000]   But part of it is, again, maybe this is my MGI,
[02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:32.500]   maybe they haven't been told the right story
[02:03:32.500 --> 02:03:35.860]   about stress or anxiety.
[02:03:35.860 --> 02:03:37.980]   This came up with my kids the other day.
[02:03:37.980 --> 02:03:41.380]   My older son had his first basketball game of the season
[02:03:41.380 --> 02:03:42.860]   and he goes, oh, I'm really nervous,
[02:03:42.860 --> 02:03:43.980]   feeling a little anxious.
[02:03:43.980 --> 02:03:45.300]   And it's just so interesting, like,
[02:03:45.300 --> 02:03:47.740]   the way we respond in little ways to our kids
[02:03:47.740 --> 02:03:50.660]   in these moments form, like,
[02:03:50.660 --> 02:03:53.600]   the way they end up thinking about those feelings later on.
[02:03:53.600 --> 02:03:55.780]   I said, well, of course you're nervous.
[02:03:55.780 --> 02:03:57.080]   Being nervous means you care.
[02:03:57.080 --> 02:03:59.580]   You really care about basketball, right?
[02:03:59.580 --> 02:04:00.960]   And obviously we've had many conversations
[02:04:00.960 --> 02:04:02.900]   about what feelings mean, but it was so interesting.
[02:04:02.900 --> 02:04:06.180]   I watch him go, yeah, I do care.
[02:04:06.180 --> 02:04:08.300]   Kind of in that little sentence,
[02:04:08.300 --> 02:04:10.780]   being nervous means you care.
[02:04:10.780 --> 02:04:12.040]   I mean, think about it, you're never nervous
[02:04:12.040 --> 02:04:14.980]   about anything you don't care about, right?
[02:04:14.980 --> 02:04:17.900]   If being nervous means I care,
[02:04:17.900 --> 02:04:20.100]   I have a story to understand it.
[02:04:20.100 --> 02:04:22.780]   I now inherently feel like the feeling is normal.
[02:04:22.780 --> 02:04:25.540]   I'm almost, I'm almost like proud, you know?
[02:04:25.540 --> 02:04:27.220]   Like, yeah, I do care, right?
[02:04:27.220 --> 02:04:30.000]   My relationship with that feeling
[02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.420]   is going to be so different than if my parents are like,
[02:04:32.420 --> 02:04:33.260]   why are you nervous?
[02:04:33.260 --> 02:04:34.220]   There's nothing to be nervous about.
[02:04:34.220 --> 02:04:35.500]   Or, oh, you're nervous?
[02:04:35.500 --> 02:04:36.860]   Oh, does that mean you're not gonna play well?
[02:04:36.860 --> 02:04:38.380]   Oh my goodness, are you gonna miss your foul shots?
[02:04:38.380 --> 02:04:40.700]   Like, I mean, so in the first, right,
[02:04:40.700 --> 02:04:42.860]   my kid feels like being nervous is wrong.
[02:04:42.860 --> 02:04:45.080]   So I just set them up to feel like
[02:04:45.080 --> 02:04:46.420]   they're feeling the wrong feeling
[02:04:46.420 --> 02:04:47.980]   when they're feeling nervous going on.
[02:04:47.980 --> 02:04:50.220]   In the second, I'm lingering on my anxiety
[02:04:50.220 --> 02:04:52.740]   to their nervousness, not a great combo.
[02:04:52.740 --> 02:04:54.460]   But the stories we tell matter.
[02:04:54.460 --> 02:04:56.060]   So in the workplace, you're stressed.
[02:04:56.060 --> 02:04:58.120]   Yeah, you know, actually this makes me think,
[02:04:58.120 --> 02:05:00.660]   maybe not right now, we need more time.
[02:05:00.660 --> 02:05:03.860]   It'd be really helpful to talk about what is stress?
[02:05:03.860 --> 02:05:05.940]   Why do we feel stress?
[02:05:05.940 --> 02:05:08.180]   How do we talk to ourselves when we feel stressed?
[02:05:08.180 --> 02:05:11.220]   Does anyone here know the way you talk to yourself
[02:05:11.220 --> 02:05:12.860]   when you're stressed?
[02:05:12.860 --> 02:05:16.940]   Has the power to make stress feel a little smaller
[02:05:16.940 --> 02:05:18.620]   or a little bigger?
[02:05:18.620 --> 02:05:19.820]   That's really interesting.
[02:05:19.820 --> 02:05:21.740]   I wonder, does anyone here use a session?
[02:05:21.740 --> 02:05:23.180]   Should we do something in the workplace
[02:05:23.180 --> 02:05:24.860]   about how to deal with stress?
[02:05:24.860 --> 02:05:28.940]   Because you're right, this is a stressful job.
[02:05:28.940 --> 02:05:32.020]   And this is where I don't think about power, but authority.
[02:05:32.020 --> 02:05:34.620]   And I wanna own that and let you know that.
[02:05:34.620 --> 02:05:37.540]   Stress comes along with this type of job.
[02:05:37.540 --> 02:05:38.380]   I'm making this up.
[02:05:38.380 --> 02:05:40.620]   And this is why you get paid pretty well.
[02:05:40.620 --> 02:05:43.420]   And this is why, you know, whatever else could be true.
[02:05:43.420 --> 02:05:45.980]   But one of my jobs is not just being honest,
[02:05:45.980 --> 02:05:48.460]   but actually helping everyone develop the best skills
[02:05:48.460 --> 02:05:51.060]   that maybe no one ever taught them before to manage stress.
[02:05:51.060 --> 02:05:52.460]   Let me know if that's of interest.
[02:05:52.460 --> 02:05:55.180]   I just think about the whole mood just changed.
[02:05:55.180 --> 02:05:59.540]   You kind of own your authority and you own the story.
[02:05:59.540 --> 02:06:01.420]   And I think whether you're talking about being a CEO
[02:06:01.420 --> 02:06:04.380]   or being a parent, it's actually all the same.
[02:06:04.380 --> 02:06:06.860]   That makes sense.
[02:06:06.860 --> 02:06:08.940]   I have a rule, which is if my pulse rate
[02:06:08.940 --> 02:06:12.260]   goes above a certain limit, my thumbs stop working.
[02:06:12.260 --> 02:06:14.620]   Meaning I won't allow myself to text.
[02:06:14.620 --> 02:06:16.740]   I don't talk on the phone.
[02:06:16.740 --> 02:06:18.740]   I'll just, I'll go in the bathroom
[02:06:18.740 --> 02:06:20.060]   and just sit for a second if I have to.
[02:06:20.060 --> 02:06:20.900]   But that's rare.
[02:06:20.900 --> 02:06:22.420]   Typically I just, I'm like, I have a rule.
[02:06:22.420 --> 02:06:24.700]   My heart rate goes up, my thumbs don't work.
[02:06:24.700 --> 02:06:25.780]   What do you do?
[02:06:25.780 --> 02:06:26.860]   I just do nothing.
[02:06:26.860 --> 02:06:28.100]   I follow the do nothing thing.
[02:06:28.100 --> 02:06:28.980]   I just wait.
[02:06:28.980 --> 02:06:30.180]   I mean, I also have a rule,
[02:06:30.180 --> 02:06:31.580]   which is unless somebody's hemorrhaging
[02:06:31.580 --> 02:06:34.940]   right in front of me, it usually can wait.
[02:06:34.940 --> 02:06:37.940]   Drives people crazy, but they thank me later.
[02:06:37.940 --> 02:06:39.580]   Like unless somebody is literally hemorrhaging,
[02:06:39.580 --> 02:06:41.180]   like I can pause my response.
[02:06:41.180 --> 02:06:45.740]   Because I'm a kind of like move fast,
[02:06:45.740 --> 02:06:48.500]   get things done kind of person.
[02:06:48.500 --> 02:06:51.540]   And actually it was taught to me by a chairman
[02:06:51.540 --> 02:06:54.580]   of a major university in your home city of New York City.
[02:06:54.580 --> 02:06:56.940]   He said, there's always more time.
[02:06:56.940 --> 02:06:57.820]   And I said, that's ridiculous.
[02:06:57.820 --> 02:06:59.100]   He said, unless somebody is hemorrhaging
[02:06:59.100 --> 02:07:01.340]   right in front of you, there's always more time.
[02:07:01.340 --> 02:07:03.180]   Going back to my daughter, it's one of the mantras
[02:07:03.180 --> 02:07:05.340]   that's been really helpful for me as someone who, again,
[02:07:05.340 --> 02:07:08.900]   just knowing myself, I always like to go, go, go.
[02:07:08.900 --> 02:07:12.980]   I get so much pleasure, probably identity value
[02:07:12.980 --> 02:07:14.540]   from doing things.
[02:07:14.540 --> 02:07:16.900]   And so a by-product of that
[02:07:16.900 --> 02:07:18.500]   is I always kind of feel like I'm in a rush
[02:07:18.500 --> 02:07:22.660]   because my body craves movement and checking things off.
[02:07:22.660 --> 02:07:26.180]   But being in a rush is never terribly helpful
[02:07:26.180 --> 02:07:27.580]   in close relationships.
[02:07:27.580 --> 02:07:28.700]   No one likes to feel like,
[02:07:28.700 --> 02:07:31.460]   Mike, you get to the end of the story or it's not good.
[02:07:31.460 --> 02:07:33.940]   - So sometimes I think efficiency
[02:07:33.940 --> 02:07:37.020]   and relationship building are like antithetical.
[02:07:37.020 --> 02:07:40.180]   - I, amen, a thousand times over.
[02:07:40.180 --> 02:07:44.140]   No, I don't think we can be efficient in relationships.
[02:07:44.140 --> 02:07:47.420]   It's like efficiency in other things is beautiful.
[02:07:47.420 --> 02:07:50.060]   - Well, it's a unitary experience being efficient
[02:07:50.060 --> 02:07:50.900]   in relation.
[02:07:50.900 --> 02:07:54.220]   And so like when I can be in efficiency mode a lot,
[02:07:54.220 --> 02:07:56.380]   and it's something that I have to really think
[02:07:56.380 --> 02:07:58.620]   when I'm going home to my closest relationships.
[02:07:58.620 --> 02:07:59.780]   And it's interesting now that I work
[02:07:59.780 --> 02:08:01.340]   so much more than I used to,
[02:08:01.340 --> 02:08:03.860]   it's almost reinforcing the efficiency mode.
[02:08:03.860 --> 02:08:06.020]   So I really know I have to, you know,
[02:08:06.020 --> 02:08:07.740]   my own therapy, like really work on,
[02:08:07.740 --> 02:08:11.140]   like that's not a value of mine all the time.
[02:08:11.140 --> 02:08:12.740]   At work, maybe sometimes, even there,
[02:08:12.740 --> 02:08:13.740]   sometimes you gotta get out of it
[02:08:13.740 --> 02:08:15.860]   to connect to people, right?
[02:08:15.860 --> 02:08:19.100]   And so that is something again,
[02:08:19.100 --> 02:08:22.660]   where like knowing where I am on that scale,
[02:08:22.660 --> 02:08:24.700]   asking people to call me out.
[02:08:24.700 --> 02:08:26.540]   Oh, mom, you're rushing me at night.
[02:08:26.540 --> 02:08:28.660]   Becky, I wanna tell you the whole story.
[02:08:28.660 --> 02:08:30.980]   I'm not just trying to give you the TLDR.
[02:08:30.980 --> 02:08:33.260]   I want the experience of telling the story.
[02:08:33.260 --> 02:08:35.260]   I'm like, right, I'm doing that thing.
[02:08:35.260 --> 02:08:38.980]   - Yeah, slowing down is rarely a mistake.
[02:08:38.980 --> 02:08:42.140]   I guess occasionally, but rarely a mistake.
[02:08:42.140 --> 02:08:42.980]   - Really true.
[02:08:42.980 --> 02:08:46.260]   - I'd like to talk a little bit about technology.
[02:08:46.260 --> 02:08:48.860]   I know this is a growing interest of yours.
[02:08:48.860 --> 02:08:50.420]   I've been thinking a little bit
[02:08:50.420 --> 02:08:53.620]   based on our earlier discussion
[02:08:53.620 --> 02:08:55.900]   about sort of people who are in their own container
[02:08:55.900 --> 02:08:57.900]   or sensing what's going on inside them
[02:08:57.900 --> 02:09:00.180]   prior to paying attention to
[02:09:00.180 --> 02:09:01.620]   and sensing what's going on in other people,
[02:09:01.620 --> 02:09:03.900]   because clearly both are important.
[02:09:03.900 --> 02:09:06.660]   I don't like this idea that it's like one or the other.
[02:09:06.660 --> 02:09:10.580]   But with the advent of text messaging,
[02:09:10.580 --> 02:09:12.540]   so here I'm not gonna talk about social media.
[02:09:12.540 --> 02:09:14.540]   This is not about social media.
[02:09:14.540 --> 02:09:17.340]   With text messaging, first of all,
[02:09:17.340 --> 02:09:18.740]   this is the first time in human evolution
[02:09:18.740 --> 02:09:21.460]   that humans have written with their thumbs.
[02:09:21.460 --> 02:09:24.380]   That's weird, been kind of quirky reflection.
[02:09:24.380 --> 02:09:26.180]   But the other one is this is the first time
[02:09:26.180 --> 02:09:28.060]   in human evolution, meaning very recently,
[02:09:28.060 --> 02:09:30.420]   that we are aware of what's going on
[02:09:30.420 --> 02:09:31.500]   with so many other people
[02:09:31.500 --> 02:09:34.540]   and we're expected to at least know it
[02:09:34.540 --> 02:09:36.100]   and perhaps even respond to it.
[02:09:36.100 --> 02:09:39.860]   I mean, it's just, I know people younger than 30
[02:09:39.860 --> 02:09:41.580]   are probably going, wait, no, it's always been this way,
[02:09:41.580 --> 02:09:42.820]   but it wasn't always this way.
[02:09:42.820 --> 02:09:45.300]   Clearly our brain has adapted to this new format,
[02:09:45.300 --> 02:09:47.980]   but it did not evolve in this format,
[02:09:47.980 --> 02:09:51.260]   whereby you're getting on a plane and you look at your phone
[02:09:51.260 --> 02:09:54.300]   and you are aware of the movements and requests
[02:09:54.300 --> 02:09:58.140]   and maybe kind statements, et cetera, from other people.
[02:09:58.140 --> 02:10:01.020]   We are tethered in so many ways,
[02:10:01.020 --> 02:10:03.660]   and that means that our brain is really tethered
[02:10:03.660 --> 02:10:06.820]   to the states of others, their emotional states,
[02:10:06.820 --> 02:10:08.460]   their physical states, where they are.
[02:10:08.460 --> 02:10:09.980]   You said, and I'll keep repeating it
[02:10:09.980 --> 02:10:10.820]   'cause I love it so much,
[02:10:10.820 --> 02:10:12.420]   the more you can locate somebody,
[02:10:12.420 --> 02:10:15.020]   the more it reflects their values.
[02:10:15.020 --> 02:10:17.740]   So being able to locate somebody in space and time
[02:10:17.740 --> 02:10:19.380]   and understand how bounded they are
[02:10:19.380 --> 02:10:22.560]   or not to their own emotions or yours is fantastic,
[02:10:22.560 --> 02:10:24.820]   but the fact that you have 10 people in your phone
[02:10:24.820 --> 02:10:27.140]   that you're aware of,
[02:10:27.140 --> 02:10:29.540]   you're not even supposed to be aware of 10 people at once,
[02:10:29.540 --> 02:10:31.060]   except the 10 people perhaps around you
[02:10:31.060 --> 02:10:33.180]   on the, you know, boarding a plane.
[02:10:33.180 --> 02:10:34.120]   - Yeah.
[02:10:34.120 --> 02:10:37.620]   - So we're being forced to navigate a new landscape
[02:10:37.620 --> 02:10:38.460]   with all this.
[02:10:38.460 --> 02:10:39.700]   - Yes.
[02:10:39.700 --> 02:10:42.840]   - After this conversation folds, we'll look at our phones.
[02:10:42.840 --> 02:10:45.940]   You couldn't have that many, I guarantee you one thing,
[02:10:45.940 --> 02:10:47.240]   no matter how many text messages
[02:10:47.240 --> 02:10:48.900]   or few text messages you have,
[02:10:48.900 --> 02:10:51.940]   it's far more conversations, if you will,
[02:10:51.940 --> 02:10:54.740]   than you could possibly have by phone at once.
[02:10:54.740 --> 02:10:55.580]   - Yep.
[02:10:55.580 --> 02:10:58.020]   - So in the old days, you left messages
[02:10:58.020 --> 02:11:00.020]   and you'd get on the phone when you could.
[02:11:00.020 --> 02:11:01.220]   Not saying we go back to that,
[02:11:01.220 --> 02:11:04.320]   but I think we might be asking ourselves to do something
[02:11:04.320 --> 02:11:09.320]   that is impossibly hard and maybe even bad for us.
[02:11:09.320 --> 02:11:14.640]   - Yeah, I don't know how apocalyptic
[02:11:14.640 --> 02:11:16.420]   you want me to get about this,
[02:11:16.420 --> 02:11:18.580]   but I think I actually,
[02:11:18.580 --> 02:11:20.780]   you know, my husband and I were talking about phones
[02:11:20.780 --> 02:11:25.120]   and text and social media and AI.
[02:11:25.120 --> 02:11:27.260]   And I brought up something to him,
[02:11:27.260 --> 02:11:28.100]   he's like, "I don't think I,
[02:11:28.100 --> 02:11:29.820]   "in all the arguments I've heard, I haven't heard that."
[02:11:29.820 --> 02:11:34.820]   Where I feel like we're changing in a dramatic way
[02:11:34.820 --> 02:11:39.300]   our basic evolutionary drive around attachment
[02:11:39.300 --> 02:11:43.540]   in a way where attachment has always been
[02:11:43.540 --> 02:11:46.540]   the primary evolutionary drive of humans.
[02:11:46.540 --> 02:11:49.460]   And with all the different technological shifts
[02:11:49.460 --> 02:11:50.740]   there have been, 'cause people always say,
[02:11:50.740 --> 02:11:53.020]   "Oh, there's been this, there's been this."
[02:11:53.020 --> 02:11:57.580]   What's never been shifted is kind of the nature really
[02:11:57.580 --> 02:12:00.360]   of one-to-one human attachment.
[02:12:00.360 --> 02:12:04.500]   We're entering into something really new
[02:12:04.500 --> 02:12:07.780]   where let's even say text messages, 20 at once, 10 at once.
[02:12:07.780 --> 02:12:13.980]   Our bodies will always crave what's immediately gratifying
[02:12:13.980 --> 02:12:16.140]   over what is long-term good for us.
[02:12:16.140 --> 02:12:19.140]   It's just, another way I think about it is
[02:12:19.140 --> 02:12:21.420]   our bodies will always choose convenience
[02:12:21.420 --> 02:12:22.740]   and ease and gratification
[02:12:22.740 --> 02:12:24.540]   over what's good for us long-term.
[02:12:24.540 --> 02:12:26.420]   So you think about all these pings coming in.
[02:12:26.420 --> 02:12:28.460]   It's a lot of information, this text, that text,
[02:12:28.460 --> 02:12:29.900]   this text, this text.
[02:12:29.900 --> 02:12:32.180]   And what you're doing in your circuitry
[02:12:32.180 --> 02:12:33.660]   and over time evolutionarily
[02:12:33.660 --> 02:12:36.160]   is getting used to the multiplicity of relationships,
[02:12:36.160 --> 02:12:37.740]   the multiplicity of information.
[02:12:37.740 --> 02:12:41.100]   It's just more gratifying than one-on-one
[02:12:41.100 --> 02:12:43.980]   to the point that one-on-one conversation
[02:12:43.980 --> 02:12:45.620]   over text or even in person
[02:12:47.460 --> 02:12:49.380]   is gonna have so much more of a gap
[02:12:49.380 --> 02:12:53.780]   than it ever has been in terms of how slow,
[02:12:53.780 --> 02:12:58.780]   how low stim and how boring and awkward it is
[02:12:58.780 --> 02:13:03.440]   compared to, especially for kids who get this early,
[02:13:03.440 --> 02:13:05.320]   the constant information flow
[02:13:05.320 --> 02:13:08.060]   and gratification and stimulation.
[02:13:08.060 --> 02:13:10.260]   I think that's gonna have a profound impact,
[02:13:10.260 --> 02:13:12.380]   not right away, but over time.
[02:13:12.380 --> 02:13:15.340]   And if you add in social media and then if you add in AI,
[02:13:15.340 --> 02:13:19.180]   I mean, on the way humans just are even able
[02:13:19.180 --> 02:13:20.700]   to relate to each other.
[02:13:20.700 --> 02:13:25.500]   So yes, I think like this advancement in technology
[02:13:25.500 --> 02:13:27.100]   and what's happening,
[02:13:27.100 --> 02:13:29.500]   I think there's always been a trade-off, always,
[02:13:29.500 --> 02:13:32.180]   between how short-term gratifying something is
[02:13:32.180 --> 02:13:34.380]   and how long-term good something is for us.
[02:13:34.380 --> 02:13:35.960]   Because the things that are really good
[02:13:35.960 --> 02:13:37.340]   for humans long-term
[02:13:37.340 --> 02:13:40.580]   are the things that involve humans to tolerate frustration.
[02:13:40.580 --> 02:13:41.980]   I would say that is the most important skill,
[02:13:41.980 --> 02:13:44.100]   I think, for kids to learn.
[02:13:44.100 --> 02:13:48.420]   But the world more than ever is built now
[02:13:48.420 --> 02:13:50.500]   with insanely low frustration tolerance
[02:13:50.500 --> 02:13:52.940]   'cause we're built for so much information,
[02:13:52.940 --> 02:13:55.800]   so much consumption and so much media gratification.
[02:13:55.800 --> 02:13:56.640]   This is actually, I think,
[02:13:56.640 --> 02:13:58.140]   the thing that isn't talked about with technology.
[02:13:58.140 --> 02:13:59.300]   It's why parenting has changed.
[02:13:59.300 --> 02:14:01.860]   It's why so much of parenting is about making kids happy
[02:14:01.860 --> 02:14:03.120]   and their lives easy
[02:14:03.120 --> 02:14:05.700]   because there's never been a generation of parents
[02:14:05.700 --> 02:14:09.980]   like my generation where our lives are just so much easier.
[02:14:09.980 --> 02:14:13.700]   We have so much less tolerance for our kids' tantrums
[02:14:13.700 --> 02:14:16.580]   because we're on our phones wanting our life to be easier.
[02:14:16.580 --> 02:14:18.060]   So we stop the tantrum.
[02:14:18.060 --> 02:14:19.140]   We make their life easier.
[02:14:19.140 --> 02:14:19.980]   We make them anxious.
[02:14:19.980 --> 02:14:21.220]   We make them fragile
[02:14:21.220 --> 02:14:23.540]   'cause of our lowered frustration tolerance.
[02:14:23.540 --> 02:14:25.700]   So I don't know where we're landing here,
[02:14:25.700 --> 02:14:28.100]   but, and by the way, I text.
[02:14:28.100 --> 02:14:29.700]   Like, I'm not like a purist here.
[02:14:29.700 --> 02:14:30.960]   You know, I am a realist.
[02:14:30.960 --> 02:14:32.600]   I live in the world, you know?
[02:14:32.600 --> 02:14:37.220]   But I think it's profound how it's changing,
[02:14:37.220 --> 02:14:40.860]   human interaction and expectations and gratification.
[02:14:40.860 --> 02:14:44.460]   And my colleague, Anna Lembke, who wrote "Dopamine Nation,"
[02:14:44.460 --> 02:14:48.420]   cited some data that humans have more free time now
[02:14:48.420 --> 02:14:50.980]   across socioeconomic groups,
[02:14:50.980 --> 02:14:54.420]   more free time for everybody than ever before,
[02:14:54.420 --> 02:14:57.560]   more expectation of immediate gratification.
[02:14:57.560 --> 02:15:00.440]   And it's not just the texts that we're getting.
[02:15:00.440 --> 02:15:03.380]   It's, for some people, the texts that they're not getting.
[02:15:03.380 --> 02:15:04.360]   They're thinking about the people
[02:15:04.360 --> 02:15:05.900]   that they haven't heard back from, et cetera.
[02:15:05.900 --> 02:15:08.660]   I mean, the number of tethers, right, exactly.
[02:15:08.660 --> 02:15:13.360]   Like, the number of tethers is just astonishing.
[02:15:13.360 --> 02:15:17.020]   I had a conversation with somebody recently
[02:15:17.020 --> 02:15:20.100]   that popped to mind where it was a little bit,
[02:15:20.100 --> 02:15:21.980]   it was like a low friction one
[02:15:21.980 --> 02:15:24.620]   that ended in a really good place where I said,
[02:15:24.620 --> 02:15:27.820]   you know, the problem is, you know, I was talking about,
[02:15:27.820 --> 02:15:28.860]   there's a little bit of an age gap.
[02:15:28.860 --> 02:15:31.860]   And I said, you know, the problem is you think slow is low.
[02:15:31.860 --> 02:15:34.800]   Like, what I was saying was I like to just chill.
[02:15:34.800 --> 02:15:36.620]   This is something I haven't done enough of in my life
[02:15:36.620 --> 02:15:39.300]   'cause I'm pretty ambitious person and always have been
[02:15:39.300 --> 02:15:42.340]   since I was little about everything.
[02:15:42.340 --> 02:15:46.180]   But I've learned that like slow isn't low.
[02:15:46.180 --> 02:15:47.860]   Like I love just like sitting down
[02:15:47.860 --> 02:15:50.220]   and like hanging out with the dog
[02:15:50.220 --> 02:15:53.940]   or just like slowing down.
[02:15:53.940 --> 02:15:56.260]   And it used to feel like slow was low.
[02:15:56.260 --> 02:15:57.860]   It used to feel like, oh, nothing's happening
[02:15:57.860 --> 02:16:00.740]   or this is depressing or it's boring.
[02:16:00.740 --> 02:16:02.260]   And I think in recent years
[02:16:02.260 --> 02:16:03.700]   that became more and more the case
[02:16:03.700 --> 02:16:06.060]   as I got more and more pulled into technology.
[02:16:06.060 --> 02:16:07.060]   And then I did a little bit
[02:16:07.060 --> 02:16:09.820]   of a technology distancing experiment, if you will.
[02:16:09.820 --> 02:16:11.540]   I have this wooden box that someone made for me
[02:16:11.540 --> 02:16:12.820]   and I put my phones in there.
[02:16:12.820 --> 02:16:15.380]   And it's so amazing how once you put the phone
[02:16:15.380 --> 02:16:17.340]   in a different container,
[02:16:17.340 --> 02:16:19.460]   it like completely changes the relationship to it.
[02:16:19.460 --> 02:16:21.420]   I don't get it, but anyway, again,
[02:16:21.420 --> 02:16:24.060]   physical barriers to take emotional steps,
[02:16:24.060 --> 02:16:25.060]   always a good idea.
[02:16:25.060 --> 02:16:29.660]   And I just realized like slow isn't low,
[02:16:29.660 --> 02:16:31.060]   like slow is awesome.
[02:16:31.060 --> 02:16:33.840]   So I totally agree that the circuits of our brain
[02:16:33.840 --> 02:16:36.540]   have now adapted to expect immediate gratification.
[02:16:36.540 --> 02:16:40.540]   I like to think, and maybe this is a false wish,
[02:16:40.540 --> 02:16:44.540]   but I like to think that there are components
[02:16:44.540 --> 02:16:46.420]   of our brain that are hardwired enough
[02:16:46.420 --> 02:16:50.260]   through tens or hundreds of thousands of years of evolution
[02:16:50.260 --> 02:16:52.820]   that might be able to recognize
[02:16:52.820 --> 02:16:54.820]   and appreciate the slow moments
[02:16:54.820 --> 02:16:56.860]   and not feel like slow is low,
[02:16:56.860 --> 02:16:58.220]   meaning slow is depressing.
[02:16:58.220 --> 02:17:02.540]   But I do think that if one is weaned in,
[02:17:02.540 --> 02:17:06.060]   raised in an environment where you expect things quickly,
[02:17:06.060 --> 02:17:09.180]   well then, it's gonna feel like the horse and cart
[02:17:09.180 --> 02:17:11.660]   compared to the car at some level.
[02:17:11.660 --> 02:17:12.720]   I do, I agree. - I think that's right.
[02:17:12.720 --> 02:17:15.740]   And I think for parents who have young kids,
[02:17:15.740 --> 02:17:19.220]   I think these are such powerful and empowering things
[02:17:19.220 --> 02:17:20.620]   to think about when your kids are young,
[02:17:20.620 --> 02:17:22.420]   because I think it's easy to think,
[02:17:22.420 --> 02:17:25.220]   oh, okay, so I'll deal with this when my kid gets a phone.
[02:17:25.220 --> 02:17:29.100]   It's the circuits around
[02:17:29.100 --> 02:17:30.660]   even how your kid will use the phone,
[02:17:30.660 --> 02:17:32.460]   how much you're gonna be able to set boundaries
[02:17:32.460 --> 02:17:34.300]   with your kid when they get a phone,
[02:17:34.300 --> 02:17:37.060]   all these have to do with the patterns early on, right?
[02:17:37.060 --> 02:17:41.300]   So if we go back to slow is good,
[02:17:41.300 --> 02:17:44.060]   frustration and frustration tolerance
[02:17:44.060 --> 02:17:45.260]   is the name of the game.
[02:17:45.260 --> 02:17:49.180]   It requires a lot of inconvenient moments
[02:17:49.180 --> 02:17:54.180]   that matter so much for how not only your kid learns
[02:17:54.180 --> 02:17:57.180]   to tolerate the frustration inherent in life,
[02:17:57.180 --> 02:17:58.640]   but I think this is really important,
[02:17:58.640 --> 02:18:01.680]   how your kid learns to feel capable.
[02:18:01.680 --> 02:18:04.520]   Kids only develop capability
[02:18:04.520 --> 02:18:07.220]   from watching themselves get through hard things.
[02:18:07.220 --> 02:18:09.940]   They don't develop capability by being successful ever.
[02:18:09.940 --> 02:18:13.340]   In some ways, it builds up this pressure and a fragility
[02:18:13.340 --> 02:18:15.500]   if that's been the only thing they have.
[02:18:15.500 --> 02:18:17.380]   And when we think about this whole generation
[02:18:17.380 --> 02:18:20.140]   who's so anxious, kind of so fragile,
[02:18:20.140 --> 02:18:24.460]   I really believe the antidote to anxiety is capability.
[02:18:24.460 --> 02:18:26.540]   And we, I'll give an example,
[02:18:26.540 --> 02:18:28.980]   like we steal our kids' capability
[02:18:28.980 --> 02:18:30.860]   all the time when they're young
[02:18:30.860 --> 02:18:33.640]   in the name of short-term convenience for everyone.
[02:18:33.640 --> 02:18:36.100]   So here's an example, like I remember this day,
[02:18:36.100 --> 02:18:38.460]   my oldest who's now 13, he was like three
[02:18:38.460 --> 02:18:41.060]   and he was really into puzzles when he was three.
[02:18:41.060 --> 02:18:43.620]   But puzzles are like really hard, right?
[02:18:43.620 --> 02:18:46.900]   He was working on it, something like I can't do it,
[02:18:46.900 --> 02:18:48.660]   you know, the classic whine,
[02:18:48.660 --> 02:18:49.780]   which I just want everyone to know,
[02:18:49.780 --> 02:18:52.620]   like no part of me is like, I love that sound.
[02:18:52.620 --> 02:18:55.420]   No, like nobody likes whining, okay?
[02:18:57.340 --> 02:19:01.220]   But to me, those are our like bang for our buck moments.
[02:19:01.220 --> 02:19:02.500]   You know, they're not our easy moments,
[02:19:02.500 --> 02:19:03.420]   they're our bang for our buck.
[02:19:03.420 --> 02:19:04.740]   My kid is gonna learn something
[02:19:04.740 --> 02:19:07.300]   about how to deal with situations
[02:19:07.300 --> 02:19:10.300]   they don't think they're capable of completing.
[02:19:10.300 --> 02:19:13.380]   That is such an important lesson.
[02:19:13.380 --> 02:19:14.420]   And I have a fork in the road,
[02:19:14.420 --> 02:19:16.500]   I can either do the puzzle for him,
[02:19:16.500 --> 02:19:20.060]   which gives me short-term convenience, stops the meltdown.
[02:19:20.060 --> 02:19:23.820]   But beyond frustration tolerance,
[02:19:23.820 --> 02:19:25.500]   like one of the things I really remember thinking
[02:19:25.500 --> 02:19:29.340]   when my kid was young is, if I do it for him,
[02:19:29.340 --> 02:19:33.180]   I'm stealing his capability.
[02:19:33.180 --> 02:19:37.140]   Because if he can get through this
[02:19:37.140 --> 02:19:39.460]   and kind of get to the point where he says,
[02:19:39.460 --> 02:19:43.700]   I did a puzzle I didn't think I could do, that's incredible.
[02:19:43.700 --> 02:19:48.660]   So I remember this 'cause it felt so, he's still whining,
[02:19:48.660 --> 02:19:50.100]   but there are these moments as a parent,
[02:19:50.100 --> 02:19:51.900]   and this is what I like to help parents with,
[02:19:51.900 --> 02:19:54.340]   our wins are not based on our kids' reactions.
[02:19:54.340 --> 02:19:56.140]   Our wins happen when you just know
[02:19:56.140 --> 02:19:58.460]   there's this amazing feeling you have as a parent,
[02:19:58.460 --> 02:20:01.060]   I know that was important, I know it.
[02:20:01.060 --> 02:20:04.140]   And I remember saying to him with this puzzle situation,
[02:20:04.140 --> 02:20:06.980]   sweetie, I'm not gonna do the puzzle for you.
[02:20:06.980 --> 02:20:08.300]   And I wanna tell you why.
[02:20:08.300 --> 02:20:14.500]   The feeling you get when you think you can't do something,
[02:20:14.500 --> 02:20:17.220]   kind of take a deep breath, maybe take a break,
[02:20:17.220 --> 02:20:22.180]   maybe even the next day, watch yourself do that thing
[02:20:22.180 --> 02:20:24.660]   is literally the best feeling in the world.
[02:20:24.660 --> 02:20:27.340]   It is the best feeling, it becomes addictive,
[02:20:27.340 --> 02:20:31.260]   and I will not take that feeling away from you
[02:20:31.260 --> 02:20:33.380]   because I believe you're gonna get it.
[02:20:33.380 --> 02:20:34.220]   I could cry.
[02:20:34.220 --> 02:20:38.300]   And one of the things, I feel like people hear the story,
[02:20:38.300 --> 02:20:40.380]   like, "Riley, Riley, okay, Becky, great."
[02:20:40.380 --> 02:20:41.380]   I do not do that all the time.
[02:20:41.380 --> 02:20:43.100]   Sometimes I finish the puzzle.
[02:20:43.100 --> 02:20:44.940]   But when we think about what we want
[02:20:44.940 --> 02:20:47.260]   for our kids later in life,
[02:20:47.260 --> 02:20:49.580]   it might be, no, I'm not getting you a phone yet.
[02:20:49.580 --> 02:20:52.340]   How a kid reacts to that situation,
[02:20:52.340 --> 02:20:54.140]   it's not just about a phone.
[02:20:54.140 --> 02:20:54.980]   It's kind of, well,
[02:20:54.980 --> 02:20:57.100]   have you always just done the thing for me?
[02:20:57.100 --> 02:20:59.020]   Have you always just given me what I want?
[02:20:59.020 --> 02:21:02.340]   Do I have any ability to feel like I can tolerate
[02:21:02.340 --> 02:21:05.700]   frustration and wait and figure things out?
[02:21:05.700 --> 02:21:10.060]   That all layers into how kids react to not getting a phone,
[02:21:10.060 --> 02:21:12.340]   how kids approach hard math problems,
[02:21:12.340 --> 02:21:15.500]   how kids do or do not sit down to start their English essay.
[02:21:15.500 --> 02:21:17.340]   That is difficult to do.
[02:21:17.340 --> 02:21:20.420]   And all that stuff, you can start building those skills
[02:21:20.420 --> 02:21:22.540]   in the teenage years, don't get me wrong.
[02:21:22.540 --> 02:21:26.060]   But the leg up your kid has at 14,
[02:21:26.060 --> 02:21:28.500]   when they've been basically building those life
[02:21:28.500 --> 02:21:30.220]   and academic skills from the start,
[02:21:30.220 --> 02:21:33.980]   and they've built their identity around capability,
[02:21:33.980 --> 02:21:37.260]   like, that's what I wanna give every parent
[02:21:37.260 --> 02:21:39.420]   and every kid in the world.
[02:21:39.420 --> 02:21:40.820]   - Yeah, it's awesome.
[02:21:40.820 --> 02:21:42.900]   I said it last time we spoke, I'll say it again.
[02:21:42.900 --> 02:21:44.260]   If you're thinking of adopting,
[02:21:44.260 --> 02:21:46.940]   I'd be happy to put myself up for adoption.
[02:21:46.940 --> 02:21:50.500]   It's such a beautiful philosophy and stance to take
[02:21:50.500 --> 02:21:51.900]   around effort and frustration.
[02:21:51.900 --> 02:21:54.060]   I mean, again, this isn't about my life,
[02:21:54.060 --> 02:21:56.580]   but I feel so blessed that came up in science
[02:21:56.580 --> 02:21:58.420]   where things take forever.
[02:21:58.420 --> 02:21:59.980]   You can work two years on a project
[02:21:59.980 --> 02:22:02.380]   and then discover you do the right control experiment,
[02:22:02.380 --> 02:22:04.660]   and you're like, we got nothing.
[02:22:04.660 --> 02:22:06.020]   Like, literally, we have nothing.
[02:22:06.020 --> 02:22:07.540]   - Yeah.
[02:22:07.540 --> 02:22:09.740]   - There wasn't, and there still isn't a tendency
[02:22:09.740 --> 02:22:11.340]   to publish what are called negative results,
[02:22:11.340 --> 02:22:12.300]   which aren't bad results,
[02:22:12.300 --> 02:22:13.700]   but where you basically got nothing.
[02:22:13.700 --> 02:22:16.140]   You can find a flaw in the reagents you're using,
[02:22:16.140 --> 02:22:18.060]   you get nothing, you're starting again.
[02:22:18.060 --> 02:22:21.140]   And to have that a few times,
[02:22:21.140 --> 02:22:23.940]   and to have some papers take two, three, four years
[02:22:23.940 --> 02:22:25.620]   to get accepted, other papers, six months.
[02:22:25.620 --> 02:22:27.940]   I'll tell you, the six months feels really short.
[02:22:27.940 --> 02:22:31.700]   These days we get so much immediate gratification.
[02:22:31.700 --> 02:22:33.020]   The other day I was staying at a hotel
[02:22:33.020 --> 02:22:36.460]   and I ordered food in.
[02:22:36.460 --> 02:22:37.900]   I don't do it that often.
[02:22:37.900 --> 02:22:40.140]   I was like, I really want like a poke bowl.
[02:22:40.140 --> 02:22:41.060]   There's that poke bowl place.
[02:22:41.060 --> 02:22:43.660]   I ordered, it was there in 11 minutes.
[02:22:43.660 --> 02:22:45.820]   I was like, whoa, like, this is so wild.
[02:22:45.820 --> 02:22:47.420]   I was like, I gotta be careful.
[02:22:47.420 --> 02:22:48.900]   Not 'cause I'll overeat poke bowls,
[02:22:48.900 --> 02:22:50.700]   you can only have so many poke bowls,
[02:22:50.700 --> 02:22:53.620]   but it's like, you just, it's there.
[02:22:53.620 --> 02:22:54.460]   - Convenience.
[02:22:54.460 --> 02:22:55.300]   - Yeah.
[02:22:55.300 --> 02:22:56.140]   - It's so, you know.
[02:22:56.140 --> 02:22:56.980]   - It's incredible.
[02:22:56.980 --> 02:22:57.820]   - I remember.
[02:22:57.820 --> 02:23:00.700]   - And sad and scary and exciting and all the things,
[02:23:00.700 --> 02:23:04.380]   you know, so I think having variable durations
[02:23:04.380 --> 02:23:08.140]   of effort reward in one's life
[02:23:08.140 --> 02:23:11.220]   and being able to see where like the latency is very short.
[02:23:11.220 --> 02:23:13.980]   Yes, social media, but you know, other things
[02:23:13.980 --> 02:23:15.860]   that where you have longer duration effort
[02:23:15.860 --> 02:23:17.620]   to reward contingencies.
[02:23:17.620 --> 02:23:19.220]   I'm sounding kind of, this is like nerd speak,
[02:23:19.220 --> 02:23:20.820]   but I've gone on record saying before,
[02:23:20.820 --> 02:23:21.660]   and I'll say again that, you know,
[02:23:21.660 --> 02:23:25.420]   dopamine that is achieved without effort preceding it
[02:23:25.420 --> 02:23:27.700]   is just be really careful.
[02:23:27.700 --> 02:23:30.100]   It doesn't matter if it's amphetamine, cocaine,
[02:23:30.100 --> 02:23:32.600]   social media, or anything else.
[02:23:32.600 --> 02:23:36.460]   You get used to the schedule.
[02:23:36.460 --> 02:23:37.300]   - That's right.
[02:23:37.300 --> 02:23:40.300]   - And I think we need to be able to tolerate and enjoy
[02:23:40.300 --> 02:23:43.820]   and lean into and savor variable schedules
[02:23:43.820 --> 02:23:45.340]   of effort and reward.
[02:23:45.340 --> 02:23:46.500]   - It's so interesting you say that.
[02:23:46.500 --> 02:23:47.580]   I have two thoughts that, number one,
[02:23:47.580 --> 02:23:49.660]   when I think about the puzzle situation,
[02:23:49.660 --> 02:23:52.900]   that's like effort, 'cause effort, effort, effort,
[02:23:52.900 --> 02:23:55.420]   struggle, deep breath, effort, effort, nope,
[02:23:55.420 --> 02:23:56.500]   that's not it, effort, effort,
[02:23:56.500 --> 02:23:57.940]   and then you get the dopamine.
[02:23:57.940 --> 02:24:00.140]   That circuit, I just always think,
[02:24:00.140 --> 02:24:04.580]   that is such a benefit to my kid later in life.
[02:24:04.580 --> 02:24:06.660]   It's kind of the opposite of, you know,
[02:24:06.660 --> 02:24:10.180]   which we all do sometimes, but if it's the only circuit,
[02:24:10.180 --> 02:24:12.500]   being on your iPad all the time as a little kid
[02:24:12.500 --> 02:24:15.020]   and the no effort, all the dopamine.
[02:24:15.020 --> 02:24:16.620]   - Well, I think about it as a friend
[02:24:16.620 --> 02:24:18.340]   used to call it years ago, birthday money.
[02:24:18.340 --> 02:24:19.780]   There's one time each year,
[02:24:19.780 --> 02:24:21.660]   okay, maybe a couple because of the holidays,
[02:24:21.660 --> 02:24:24.960]   when you're supposed to get presents just for being you.
[02:24:24.960 --> 02:24:27.300]   It's called your birthday, right?
[02:24:27.300 --> 02:24:29.180]   Or if you're a kid, you know, or whatever,
[02:24:29.180 --> 02:24:31.760]   holidays are where we celebrate kids by giving presents
[02:24:31.760 --> 02:24:32.600]   or we celebrate each other.
[02:24:32.600 --> 02:24:35.340]   But every other day, you're not supposed to get rewards
[02:24:35.340 --> 02:24:37.960]   necessarily just because, not just for being you.
[02:24:37.960 --> 02:24:40.360]   The rewards are out there in life and appreciating things.
[02:24:40.360 --> 02:24:42.220]   I'm not trying to be too stoic here,
[02:24:42.220 --> 02:24:44.060]   but there's only one day each year
[02:24:44.060 --> 02:24:46.820]   where you get literally presents just for being you.
[02:24:46.820 --> 02:24:49.100]   The other stuff is supposed to require effort.
[02:24:49.100 --> 02:24:50.380]   - Yeah, and struggle.
[02:24:50.380 --> 02:24:52.180]   I think, you know, it's really interesting.
[02:24:52.180 --> 02:24:56.540]   My second had a lot of speech issues when she was younger
[02:24:56.540 --> 02:24:58.380]   and I kind of noticed it, like at a certain age,
[02:24:58.380 --> 02:25:00.180]   you're supposed to be building sounds and words
[02:25:00.180 --> 02:25:02.900]   and she was replacing, like as soon as she had a new sound,
[02:25:02.900 --> 02:25:05.420]   she lost one and had a sense something was going on.
[02:25:05.420 --> 02:25:07.940]   She had a pretty serious speech apraxia.
[02:25:07.940 --> 02:25:11.360]   She had to go to speech therapy three days a week, right?
[02:25:11.360 --> 02:25:12.440]   For probably a year.
[02:25:12.440 --> 02:25:14.240]   She now, you wouldn't know.
[02:25:14.240 --> 02:25:15.820]   But it was interesting, I remember at that time,
[02:25:15.820 --> 02:25:17.500]   my older one, probably five,
[02:25:17.500 --> 02:25:19.500]   maybe she was two or three and six.
[02:25:19.500 --> 02:25:21.660]   And I remember someone saying to me like,
[02:25:21.660 --> 02:25:23.820]   oh, about my daughter, like, oh, poor her kind of,
[02:25:23.820 --> 02:25:25.260]   you know, it's like a lot.
[02:25:25.260 --> 02:25:28.540]   And I don't think I said this, but it's so interesting.
[02:25:28.540 --> 02:25:32.300]   I remember thinking, she's way better off than my son.
[02:25:32.300 --> 02:25:33.980]   If I'm gonna worry about one of my kids right now,
[02:25:33.980 --> 02:25:37.020]   which I'm not worried about either, I'd worry about my son.
[02:25:37.780 --> 02:25:42.480]   His early years were so linear, so without struggle.
[02:25:42.480 --> 02:25:44.660]   Like she's gonna have an early experience
[02:25:44.660 --> 02:25:48.220]   of struggling, working hard.
[02:25:48.220 --> 02:25:50.380]   She won't remember it with her words,
[02:25:50.380 --> 02:25:53.080]   but that circuitry, which are important memories,
[02:25:53.080 --> 02:25:54.700]   ones we don't remember with our words,
[02:25:54.700 --> 02:25:56.420]   ones that our bodies remember,
[02:25:56.420 --> 02:25:58.860]   she has such an early experience
[02:25:58.860 --> 02:26:02.160]   with watching herself struggle and get to the other side.
[02:26:02.160 --> 02:26:05.860]   Like I would wish that for every child.
[02:26:05.860 --> 02:26:08.900]   And so I also think, I wanna also share that story
[02:26:08.900 --> 02:26:10.460]   because I think parents who have kids
[02:26:10.460 --> 02:26:13.460]   who have those early issues, it's so easy.
[02:26:13.460 --> 02:26:15.620]   Oh, I actually think it's really empowering
[02:26:15.620 --> 02:26:17.620]   to do a complete 180, to be like, wait,
[02:26:17.620 --> 02:26:19.260]   I'm not gonna fix this right away.
[02:26:19.260 --> 02:26:20.380]   I'm gonna support my child.
[02:26:20.380 --> 02:26:22.220]   I'm gonna let them know I believe in them.
[02:26:22.220 --> 02:26:23.900]   I'm gonna let them know I see a version of them
[02:26:23.900 --> 02:26:24.880]   that's gonna get through this.
[02:26:24.880 --> 02:26:26.180]   They're gonna still struggle.
[02:26:26.180 --> 02:26:29.340]   And that is actually gonna be like the best foundation
[02:26:29.340 --> 02:26:31.420]   and almost like the best leg up.
[02:26:31.420 --> 02:26:34.820]   - Now, I have a friend, very, very successful,
[02:26:34.820 --> 02:26:38.500]   who told me that he wasn't until he was in his forties,
[02:26:38.500 --> 02:26:42.540]   that he had like kind of a major difficult life,
[02:26:42.540 --> 02:26:45.980]   a major business disappointment, and it almost crushed him.
[02:26:45.980 --> 02:26:49.340]   But he had never had that before.
[02:26:49.340 --> 02:26:52.300]   He had been so successful over and over again.
[02:26:52.300 --> 02:26:55.660]   It was fun for me to talk to my dad recently on the podcast
[02:26:55.660 --> 02:26:59.060]   because we haven't had a conversation like that ever.
[02:26:59.060 --> 02:27:01.540]   And we were talking about sort of mistakes that one makes
[02:27:01.540 --> 02:27:05.180]   and in the context of work and et cetera.
[02:27:05.180 --> 02:27:07.260]   And he said, it's still ringing in my ears.
[02:27:07.260 --> 02:27:08.100]   He said, well, you know,
[02:27:08.100 --> 02:27:10.380]   those humiliations are actually good for us.
[02:27:10.380 --> 02:27:12.380]   He called them humiliations.
[02:27:12.380 --> 02:27:13.220]   I was like, really?
[02:27:13.220 --> 02:27:15.300]   And he was like, yeah, you know, they humble us
[02:27:15.300 --> 02:27:18.340]   and they keep us thoughtful about what we're doing next.
[02:27:18.340 --> 02:27:21.420]   And I was like, yeah, but it was kind of wild to hear that.
[02:27:21.420 --> 02:27:23.120]   I don't know why I need to hear it externally
[02:27:23.120 --> 02:27:24.060]   because I know it's true.
[02:27:24.060 --> 02:27:27.580]   I knew it was true, but yeah, it's not just making mistakes.
[02:27:27.580 --> 02:27:31.340]   Like sometimes, listen, I'm fully against bullying
[02:27:31.340 --> 02:27:34.020]   where I understand how that can be very destructive,
[02:27:34.020 --> 02:27:35.740]   but like there are gonna be times
[02:27:35.740 --> 02:27:38.180]   when we're gonna feel humiliated.
[02:27:38.180 --> 02:27:42.180]   And to be able to bounce back from that is pretty awesome.
[02:27:42.180 --> 02:27:45.460]   I actually think that builds character strength, I do.
[02:27:45.460 --> 02:27:46.580]   - Yeah, and I think, you know,
[02:27:46.580 --> 02:27:49.160]   this is like a great lead into parenting.
[02:27:49.160 --> 02:27:51.620]   I hear this all the time where someone will say,
[02:27:51.620 --> 02:27:52.920]   I don't know if my kid's being bullied,
[02:27:52.920 --> 02:27:55.620]   but like they're, you know, they were told,
[02:27:55.620 --> 02:27:56.860]   you can't play basketball with us.
[02:27:56.860 --> 02:27:58.580]   You're the worst basketball player in the grade,
[02:27:58.580 --> 02:28:00.220]   something like that, right?
[02:28:00.220 --> 02:28:02.460]   Where the way I work with parents, right,
[02:28:02.460 --> 02:28:05.700]   is again, assuming this isn't chronic,
[02:28:05.700 --> 02:28:07.780]   I don't think step one is calling the school.
[02:28:07.780 --> 02:28:11.400]   I don't think step one is calling the other parent, right?
[02:28:11.400 --> 02:28:12.740]   If you zoom out, you're right.
[02:28:12.740 --> 02:28:14.340]   Like, I don't think a kid's gonna be called
[02:28:14.340 --> 02:28:16.300]   the worst basketball player, you know,
[02:28:16.300 --> 02:28:18.600]   over and over in the course of the next couple of decades,
[02:28:18.600 --> 02:28:21.800]   but they will be called something, they'll be left out.
[02:28:21.800 --> 02:28:24.180]   Or even if nothing happens, you know what's gonna happen?
[02:28:24.180 --> 02:28:26.260]   They're gonna feel less than in a group,
[02:28:26.260 --> 02:28:29.880]   like probably a million times, I do, right, still.
[02:28:29.880 --> 02:28:32.580]   So we have this almost opportunity of like, okay,
[02:28:32.580 --> 02:28:36.740]   well, what skills would be useful when my kid is 18 and 30?
[02:28:36.740 --> 02:28:40.300]   And actually the struggle, again, is my opportunity.
[02:28:40.300 --> 02:28:43.860]   I was thinking, my kids are in my home for 18 years.
[02:28:43.860 --> 02:28:45.740]   I, this sounds like sick,
[02:28:45.740 --> 02:28:47.260]   and I don't know if I really mean this,
[02:28:47.260 --> 02:28:48.180]   but I'm gonna say it.
[02:28:48.180 --> 02:28:51.140]   I almost hope they have all the variations
[02:28:51.140 --> 02:28:54.140]   of struggles they're gonna have later on.
[02:28:54.140 --> 02:28:57.860]   'Cause then at least I can kind of get in it with them
[02:28:57.860 --> 02:28:59.620]   and like build some skills
[02:28:59.620 --> 02:29:02.360]   and help them see that they can manage.
[02:29:02.360 --> 02:29:04.940]   And then I feel like those bumps are gonna happen, right?
[02:29:04.940 --> 02:29:06.940]   I guess it's like pilots, don't they?
[02:29:06.940 --> 02:29:08.400]   When they have simulations,
[02:29:08.400 --> 02:29:10.920]   there's no way they simulate perfect flights
[02:29:10.920 --> 02:29:12.760]   and say, you're ready to fly.
[02:29:12.760 --> 02:29:15.320]   They simulate all the issues
[02:29:15.320 --> 02:29:18.980]   so that a pilot can learn the right controls,
[02:29:18.980 --> 02:29:20.240]   and then they're really prepared.
[02:29:20.240 --> 02:29:22.480]   They don't take away the issues.
[02:29:22.480 --> 02:29:23.320]   - Right.
[02:29:23.320 --> 02:29:25.480]   No, I love the analogy of flying.
[02:29:25.480 --> 02:29:28.700]   'Cause I'll never forget driving in really thick fog
[02:29:28.700 --> 02:29:29.540]   for the first time.
[02:29:29.540 --> 02:29:31.640]   This happens if you grow up in the Bay Area.
[02:29:31.640 --> 02:29:33.480]   Just being able to see one reflector at a time
[02:29:33.480 --> 02:29:34.700]   and being terrified.
[02:29:34.700 --> 02:29:38.660]   Now, like driving in fog never feels great,
[02:29:38.660 --> 02:29:39.760]   but I've been there.
[02:29:39.760 --> 02:29:41.800]   It's like, it's a familiar feeling.
[02:29:41.800 --> 02:29:44.460]   And yeah, I've been thinking a lot these days
[02:29:44.460 --> 02:29:46.620]   about this whole thing about proficiency
[02:29:46.620 --> 02:29:50.920]   and our expectation of kids nowadays,
[02:29:50.920 --> 02:29:53.500]   that we have been told for a long time
[02:29:53.500 --> 02:29:55.740]   that we need to guard against kids
[02:29:55.740 --> 02:29:57.460]   feeling terrible about themselves.
[02:29:57.460 --> 02:29:59.700]   On the other hand, we want them to be proficient.
[02:29:59.700 --> 02:30:00.780]   And what you're really talking about here,
[02:30:00.780 --> 02:30:04.380]   if I understand correctly, is proficiency at being human,
[02:30:04.380 --> 02:30:05.620]   at being really good at certain things,
[02:30:05.620 --> 02:30:07.060]   less good at others.
[02:30:07.060 --> 02:30:10.260]   I can also tell any kid, 'cause I was this kid,
[02:30:10.260 --> 02:30:12.860]   like in a group of musicians, I'm the least proficient.
[02:30:12.860 --> 02:30:14.260]   I mean, you really just don't.
[02:30:14.260 --> 02:30:16.160]   Talk about wanting someone to do nothing.
[02:30:16.160 --> 02:30:18.540]   I'm best off not even playing the triangle, okay?
[02:30:18.540 --> 02:30:20.380]   Like just doing nothing would be the best thing
[02:30:20.380 --> 02:30:22.700]   I could do to any musical effort.
[02:30:22.700 --> 02:30:25.220]   It's just, but I realized that at some point,
[02:30:25.220 --> 02:30:28.460]   even though every kid in my school played an instrument
[02:30:28.460 --> 02:30:29.700]   and they had like the youth symphony
[02:30:29.700 --> 02:30:31.420]   and all that kind of stuff,
[02:30:31.420 --> 02:30:34.260]   because it was also a time when I could just kind of relax.
[02:30:34.260 --> 02:30:38.580]   Like you don't have to be, certainly best at everything,
[02:30:38.580 --> 02:30:40.500]   but I also believe that in order to really find
[02:30:40.500 --> 02:30:42.660]   what you're kind of quote unquote meant for,
[02:30:42.660 --> 02:30:43.900]   you have to try a bunch of things
[02:30:43.900 --> 02:30:47.740]   and find out what you're never going to even approach
[02:30:47.740 --> 02:30:50.180]   partially skilled at, but you still have to try.
[02:30:50.180 --> 02:30:51.020]   I guess that's the point.
[02:30:51.020 --> 02:30:53.180]   So on the one hand, I guess I'm saying do nothing.
[02:30:53.180 --> 02:30:54.540]   On the other hand, I'm saying you still have to try.
[02:30:54.540 --> 02:30:55.640]   I guess you have to try to find out
[02:30:55.640 --> 02:30:58.100]   that you're really as bad at music as I found out I am.
[02:30:58.100 --> 02:30:58.940]   - Maybe, or I think we're also talking--
[02:30:58.940 --> 02:31:00.580]   - I'm good with it, I'm good with it.
[02:31:00.580 --> 02:31:02.260]   I love music, but I don't need to play it.
[02:31:02.260 --> 02:31:03.300]   - But I think then what you're saying
[02:31:03.300 --> 02:31:08.020]   is you're able to separate your identity from any behavior.
[02:31:08.020 --> 02:31:10.740]   Being bad at music doesn't mean you're a bad person.
[02:31:10.740 --> 02:31:12.900]   And I think anyone hears that and they're like, obviously,
[02:31:12.900 --> 02:31:17.900]   but we conflate those two things 90% of the time, right?
[02:31:17.900 --> 02:31:20.940]   That's why we really care about winning at Scrabble
[02:31:20.940 --> 02:31:23.100]   is like to some degree, we think it means we're smart
[02:31:23.100 --> 02:31:24.540]   and everyone's like, you know,
[02:31:24.540 --> 02:31:27.040]   versus I'm probably the same level of smart
[02:31:27.040 --> 02:31:29.540]   whether I win at Scrabble or lose at Scrabble, right?
[02:31:29.540 --> 02:31:31.300]   And to me, that's what confidence is.
[02:31:31.300 --> 02:31:33.900]   It's not feeling like you're the best at something.
[02:31:33.900 --> 02:31:36.380]   It's feeling like it's okay to be you
[02:31:36.380 --> 02:31:38.660]   when you're not the best at something, right?
[02:31:38.660 --> 02:31:40.660]   It's feeling at home with yourself.
[02:31:40.660 --> 02:31:43.980]   And to me, feeling at home with yourself is,
[02:31:43.980 --> 02:31:45.820]   first of all, it's an amazing internal motivator
[02:31:45.820 --> 02:31:46.660]   'cause you get to also figure out
[02:31:46.660 --> 02:31:48.820]   what you're really passionate about, right?
[02:31:49.900 --> 02:31:52.900]   And yeah, learning to participate in things
[02:31:52.900 --> 02:31:55.620]   and even have joy in things that you're not great at.
[02:31:55.620 --> 02:31:58.380]   Again, these are things I think our kids really can learn,
[02:31:58.380 --> 02:32:01.520]   not from lessons, not from a textbook,
[02:32:01.520 --> 02:32:02.940]   not really from a teacher.
[02:32:02.940 --> 02:32:04.500]   They learn it from what we model.
[02:32:04.500 --> 02:32:05.320]   It's actually interesting.
[02:32:05.320 --> 02:32:07.340]   We play a ton of board games, my family.
[02:32:07.340 --> 02:32:09.380]   And I'm just, I think they're like the antidote
[02:32:09.380 --> 02:32:10.700]   to everything on a screen.
[02:32:10.700 --> 02:32:12.340]   So we have a million board games.
[02:32:12.340 --> 02:32:13.180]   I'm the resident.
[02:32:13.180 --> 02:32:14.820]   If anyone ever needs a recommendation
[02:32:14.820 --> 02:32:15.660]   for a good board game. - What's your favorite
[02:32:15.660 --> 02:32:17.180]   board game to play as a family?
[02:32:17.180 --> 02:32:19.700]   - Okay, I love Sushi Go.
[02:32:19.700 --> 02:32:20.540]   I don't know it, but I'll check it out.
[02:32:20.540 --> 02:32:22.220]   - Sushi Go Party is the better version.
[02:32:22.220 --> 02:32:23.700]   It's actually a really great adult game too.
[02:32:23.700 --> 02:32:24.780]   It's very strategic.
[02:32:24.780 --> 02:32:26.820]   We play code names.
[02:32:26.820 --> 02:32:28.100]   We play a lot of board games.
[02:32:28.100 --> 02:32:28.980]   We play Boggle.
[02:32:28.980 --> 02:32:29.820]   We play Ghost.
[02:32:29.820 --> 02:32:31.700]   We play Scrabble.
[02:32:31.700 --> 02:32:33.820]   We play Rummikub.
[02:32:33.820 --> 02:32:36.300]   But the game I was gonna say that we also play a lot of
[02:32:36.300 --> 02:32:38.740]   that I love is Scattergories, okay?
[02:32:38.740 --> 02:32:39.580]   So have you ever played that?
[02:32:39.580 --> 02:32:41.420]   - Yeah, that's a fun game.
[02:32:41.420 --> 02:32:43.820]   - Whatever part of the brain is good at generating
[02:32:43.820 --> 02:32:45.780]   a lot of different things from a single letter
[02:32:45.780 --> 02:32:47.260]   must be very small in my brain.
[02:32:47.260 --> 02:32:50.020]   I am so bad at Scattergories.
[02:32:50.020 --> 02:32:51.740]   I mean, my kids are all pretty quick.
[02:32:51.740 --> 02:32:53.780]   I lose to everyone, my seven-year-old included.
[02:32:53.780 --> 02:32:54.620]   I'm horrible.
[02:32:54.620 --> 02:32:57.060]   It actually is a game I suggest often.
[02:32:57.060 --> 02:32:59.220]   I'm like, let's play Scattergories.
[02:32:59.220 --> 02:33:03.820]   And I think that's actually so powerful for our kids.
[02:33:03.820 --> 02:33:06.260]   I mean, I think a lot of us, if we look back,
[02:33:06.260 --> 02:33:07.980]   we think like, it's one of the reasons my parents
[02:33:07.980 --> 02:33:10.020]   didn't really play with me or do things.
[02:33:10.020 --> 02:33:11.500]   They felt like they weren't good at it.
[02:33:11.500 --> 02:33:13.860]   You know, like probably, right?
[02:33:13.860 --> 02:33:16.980]   To demonstrate to your kid, I can choose something.
[02:33:16.980 --> 02:33:18.780]   I can have joy in something.
[02:33:18.780 --> 02:33:22.980]   I can want to do something that I'm not good at.
[02:33:22.980 --> 02:33:25.260]   That is, again, gonna be more powerful to your kid
[02:33:25.260 --> 02:33:27.140]   than sitting down and saying,
[02:33:27.140 --> 02:33:28.460]   this is what we think is gonna help kids.
[02:33:28.460 --> 02:33:31.020]   It's okay to do things that you're not good at.
[02:33:31.020 --> 02:33:34.140]   You and I know, that's like logical words in the brain.
[02:33:34.140 --> 02:33:37.740]   That's not an experience they're building or internalizing.
[02:33:37.740 --> 02:33:40.700]   Kids learn from stories, from experiences.
[02:33:40.700 --> 02:33:44.260]   And so I think that's one way in terms of
[02:33:44.260 --> 02:33:46.300]   how do I help my kids be confident,
[02:33:46.300 --> 02:33:48.740]   but also just be at home with themselves
[02:33:48.740 --> 02:33:50.900]   and do things they're not best at.
[02:33:50.900 --> 02:33:52.780]   Probably the best way to do that
[02:33:52.780 --> 02:33:55.940]   is to model it over and over to your kids.
[02:33:55.940 --> 02:33:56.780]   - I love it.
[02:33:56.780 --> 02:33:58.700]   We're back to theory versus practice.
[02:33:58.700 --> 02:34:01.980]   - Yes, I'm big on practice, maybe on both.
[02:34:01.980 --> 02:34:04.980]   - I feel like as long as there are kids and adults
[02:34:04.980 --> 02:34:09.740]   that seem, I want to emphasize seem, to do everything well,
[02:34:09.740 --> 02:34:13.940]   you know, the athlete, academic, you know, musician,
[02:34:15.020 --> 02:34:18.420]   you know, good dancer, like as long as, you know,
[02:34:18.420 --> 02:34:19.580]   charming with other people,
[02:34:19.580 --> 02:34:22.980]   as long as those people exist or seem to exist,
[02:34:22.980 --> 02:34:27.660]   we're going to have to all overcome our sense that,
[02:34:27.660 --> 02:34:30.100]   you know, we should be at least partially good
[02:34:30.100 --> 02:34:34.140]   at a wide variety of things, maybe not everything.
[02:34:34.140 --> 02:34:35.460]   - Do you think those people exist?
[02:34:35.460 --> 02:34:36.680]   - No, I know they don't exist.
[02:34:36.680 --> 02:34:40.140]   I know that there are people that apparently are like that.
[02:34:40.140 --> 02:34:41.220]   - They're fakers.
[02:34:41.220 --> 02:34:44.540]   - Well, I don't know, you know, I will say that,
[02:34:44.540 --> 02:34:48.100]   you know, and this is, I don't get paid to say
[02:34:48.100 --> 02:34:52.340]   positive things about the university I work for or not,
[02:34:52.340 --> 02:34:56.140]   but the, I will say occasionally I'll meet a student
[02:34:56.140 --> 02:35:00.100]   from Stanford and I'm like, goodness gracious,
[02:35:00.100 --> 02:35:04.460]   like these, this kid, right, can apparently do everything.
[02:35:04.460 --> 02:35:06.260]   Like they're an athlete and they're a musician.
[02:35:06.260 --> 02:35:09.700]   They have all these things that there are those people.
[02:35:09.700 --> 02:35:13.740]   And I will say, but this is important,
[02:35:13.740 --> 02:35:17.220]   the pressure that the perception of those people
[02:35:17.220 --> 02:35:23.100]   creates on them without fail brings them to immense
[02:35:23.100 --> 02:35:26.380]   challenge in their life, if not then later.
[02:35:26.380 --> 02:35:27.740]   I've seen it every single time.
[02:35:27.740 --> 02:35:29.900]   I know because I grew up in the town
[02:35:29.900 --> 02:35:32.420]   where I'm now a professor and I went to school
[02:35:32.420 --> 02:35:34.980]   with many people who ended up there or, you know,
[02:35:34.980 --> 02:35:36.660]   other places like that.
[02:35:36.660 --> 02:35:37.920]   And of course there are people like that
[02:35:37.920 --> 02:35:39.260]   in every environment.
[02:35:39.260 --> 02:35:40.340]   They are outliers.
[02:35:40.340 --> 02:35:41.980]   They tend to be very salient.
[02:35:41.980 --> 02:35:46.780]   We tend to notice them and they create this, you know,
[02:35:46.780 --> 02:35:48.860]   false internal pressure.
[02:35:48.860 --> 02:35:49.940]   This is the reason I raise it.
[02:35:49.940 --> 02:35:52.820]   And I want to say it's not like they eventually, you know,
[02:35:52.820 --> 02:35:54.900]   fail and dissolve into a puddle of their own tears.
[02:35:54.900 --> 02:35:56.700]   Like hopefully they're resilient
[02:35:56.700 --> 02:35:57.820]   and they push forward in life.
[02:35:57.820 --> 02:35:59.260]   And some of them do amazing things
[02:35:59.260 --> 02:36:01.380]   and some of them do less amazing things.
[02:36:01.380 --> 02:36:04.420]   But the point is that there are people among our species
[02:36:04.420 --> 02:36:07.260]   that seem to do many, many things very, very well.
[02:36:07.260 --> 02:36:09.860]   And I think when we hold ourselves to that standard,
[02:36:10.900 --> 02:36:14.780]   we suffer and we hold ourselves back.
[02:36:14.780 --> 02:36:17.220]   I think that, I believe, I just have a central belief
[02:36:17.220 --> 02:36:19.360]   that we all do have some unique gifts
[02:36:19.360 --> 02:36:22.340]   that we're meant to bring to our life and to the world.
[02:36:22.340 --> 02:36:23.820]   And it shows up in different forms.
[02:36:23.820 --> 02:36:25.620]   And one of the worst things we can do
[02:36:25.620 --> 02:36:27.580]   in trying to find that and express it
[02:36:27.580 --> 02:36:29.660]   is trying to be really good at everything.
[02:36:29.660 --> 02:36:34.340]   I just think that's the most poisonous idea
[02:36:34.340 --> 02:36:36.580]   in the American mindset
[02:36:36.580 --> 02:36:38.140]   that we're supposed to be really good at everything.
[02:36:38.140 --> 02:36:40.120]   On the other end, I personally believe
[02:36:40.120 --> 02:36:42.460]   that we should try a variety of things
[02:36:42.460 --> 02:36:44.780]   so that we experience frustration and fail
[02:36:44.780 --> 02:36:45.980]   and eventually find what it is
[02:36:45.980 --> 02:36:49.140]   that is we're "meant to do."
[02:36:49.140 --> 02:36:51.260]   I do, but I feel also very fortunate
[02:36:51.260 --> 02:36:52.540]   that I was never really pushed
[02:36:52.540 --> 02:36:54.100]   to be excellent at everything.
[02:36:54.100 --> 02:36:56.100]   I have terrible hand-eye coordination,
[02:36:56.100 --> 02:36:57.460]   but I'm pretty good at sports with my feet.
[02:36:57.460 --> 02:37:00.140]   But when I say pretty good, I mean passable.
[02:37:00.140 --> 02:37:01.140]   So I gave up on the idea
[02:37:01.140 --> 02:37:03.740]   of becoming a professional athlete very, very young.
[02:37:03.740 --> 02:37:05.460]   So I think we have to know that we have to play games
[02:37:05.460 --> 02:37:08.260]   with our hands and our feet in order to figure that out.
[02:37:08.260 --> 02:37:11.320]   - Yeah, and I guess, you know,
[02:37:11.320 --> 02:37:13.280]   we were talking about this maybe before we started,
[02:37:13.280 --> 02:37:15.920]   but I don't know, I'm trying to think why this is,
[02:37:15.920 --> 02:37:20.260]   but I tend not to put anyone on a pedestal.
[02:37:20.260 --> 02:37:22.920]   I feel like, and maybe part of it is,
[02:37:22.920 --> 02:37:25.160]   in part of my private practice for years,
[02:37:25.160 --> 02:37:27.720]   I saw, maybe I saw the Stanford grads
[02:37:27.720 --> 02:37:29.040]   who were then living in New York.
[02:37:29.040 --> 02:37:32.520]   And they weren't literally from Stanford,
[02:37:32.520 --> 02:37:35.040]   but I'd have all these late 20-year-olds
[02:37:35.040 --> 02:37:37.920]   and their pedigree all looked the same.
[02:37:37.920 --> 02:37:40.560]   Top of their class, Ivy League,
[02:37:40.560 --> 02:37:43.480]   Goldman Sachs, this, MBA.
[02:37:43.480 --> 02:37:47.920]   And so many of them had the same
[02:37:47.920 --> 02:37:52.600]   insane anxiety and emptiness.
[02:37:52.600 --> 02:37:54.000]   I still remember the way one of them
[02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:55.120]   described how they felt,
[02:37:55.120 --> 02:37:57.600]   and she was brilliant with her words.
[02:37:57.600 --> 02:38:01.360]   And she said, "I walk around and it's like,
[02:38:01.360 --> 02:38:03.840]   "when I'm with people and doing things and at work,
[02:38:03.840 --> 02:38:05.680]   "it's like there's a ton of color.
[02:38:05.680 --> 02:38:08.600]   "When I'm alone, I feel like I am
[02:38:08.600 --> 02:38:10.840]   "an empty room with white walls."
[02:38:10.840 --> 02:38:13.000]   - Oh goodness, that's very sad.
[02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:14.280]   - Very sad. - Very sad.
[02:38:14.280 --> 02:38:15.800]   - It actually has a happy ending,
[02:38:15.800 --> 02:38:18.400]   which is really, or has a nuanced ending,
[02:38:18.400 --> 02:38:19.560]   but a happy ending where
[02:38:19.560 --> 02:38:25.760]   she feel like, it's actually,
[02:38:25.760 --> 02:38:27.000]   I was actually saying this to a friend,
[02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:28.380]   'cause it actually relates to my own childhood.
[02:38:28.380 --> 02:38:32.780]   I feel like I've grown a lot, had my therapy,
[02:38:32.780 --> 02:38:35.320]   and I feel like when I was younger,
[02:38:35.320 --> 02:38:38.200]   I was really hard-driving
[02:38:38.200 --> 02:38:41.960]   and really somewhat people-pleasing.
[02:38:41.960 --> 02:38:44.920]   And me and my friend who are both like that,
[02:38:44.920 --> 02:38:47.800]   were like that, have kids who aren't really like that,
[02:38:47.800 --> 02:38:50.120]   and they're amazing kids, and they do so well,
[02:38:50.120 --> 02:38:51.360]   and they have this internal confidence.
[02:38:51.360 --> 02:38:53.640]   But sometimes we joke, we're like,
[02:38:53.640 --> 02:38:55.900]   but there's nothing that will drive you
[02:38:55.900 --> 02:38:57.900]   like feeling not good enough.
[02:38:57.900 --> 02:38:59.120]   There's nothing that drives you
[02:38:59.120 --> 02:39:04.120]   like feeling like every test score defines yourself more.
[02:39:04.120 --> 02:39:06.000]   And it's so sick, right?
[02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:07.860]   Because we're almost like conflicted with our kids,
[02:39:07.860 --> 02:39:10.800]   like they're all great kids, they're responsible,
[02:39:10.800 --> 02:39:13.840]   but they almost have a little bit more inner contentment.
[02:39:13.840 --> 02:39:19.020]   But I think about that young woman I saw
[02:39:19.020 --> 02:39:23.580]   and how at work she felt amazing until,
[02:39:23.580 --> 02:39:27.180]   didn't happen until she was 28.
[02:39:27.180 --> 02:39:28.300]   She didn't get the promotion
[02:39:28.300 --> 02:39:30.020]   she thought she was getting.
[02:39:30.020 --> 02:39:32.260]   And then, I mean.
[02:39:32.260 --> 02:39:34.740]   - She never failed before.
[02:39:34.740 --> 02:39:36.780]   - And it's not only the never failure,
[02:39:36.780 --> 02:39:41.780]   when your internal sense of self is built outside in,
[02:39:41.780 --> 02:39:44.400]   which you actually can do
[02:39:44.400 --> 02:39:46.660]   if you have a lot of accomplishments.
[02:39:46.660 --> 02:39:48.780]   It works for a while.
[02:39:48.780 --> 02:39:51.940]   But as soon as that stops working,
[02:39:51.940 --> 02:39:54.600]   if you have nothing,
[02:39:54.600 --> 02:39:58.460]   you feel like in an empty room with white walls.
[02:39:58.460 --> 02:40:01.280]   What's really compelling about the therapy
[02:40:01.280 --> 02:40:04.560]   over the course of a number of years is I still remember
[02:40:04.560 --> 02:40:06.800]   over COVID, we were then Zooming
[02:40:06.800 --> 02:40:09.080]   and she'd had her own place
[02:40:09.080 --> 02:40:11.520]   and she actually went through this process
[02:40:11.520 --> 02:40:14.460]   and she was very artistic of painting the walls
[02:40:14.460 --> 02:40:15.520]   in her actual room,
[02:40:15.520 --> 02:40:17.820]   talking about making something concrete.
[02:40:17.820 --> 02:40:19.820]   And like kind of in the way that she was feeling
[02:40:19.820 --> 02:40:24.040]   a lot more lit up inside out instead of outside in.
[02:40:24.040 --> 02:40:25.200]   - That's great.
[02:40:25.200 --> 02:40:26.480]   - But I just think,
[02:40:26.480 --> 02:40:27.680]   I guess I know myself too.
[02:40:27.680 --> 02:40:28.960]   And maybe this is part of why I try
[02:40:28.960 --> 02:40:30.400]   not to put people on a pedestal.
[02:40:30.400 --> 02:40:31.440]   Maybe it's as I'm talking,
[02:40:31.440 --> 02:40:33.200]   people are like, oh, Becky gets it right with her kids
[02:40:33.200 --> 02:40:34.040]   and she's doing this.
[02:40:34.040 --> 02:40:36.280]   And like, whatever I can share,
[02:40:36.280 --> 02:40:38.480]   like that is part of my story.
[02:40:38.480 --> 02:40:39.840]   I also yell at my kids.
[02:40:39.840 --> 02:40:42.000]   I also feel like sometimes I'm on my phone too much.
[02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:44.020]   I feel like my life is out of balance.
[02:40:44.020 --> 02:40:46.080]   I don't get to see my friends nearly the way I used to.
[02:40:46.080 --> 02:40:48.040]   They probably often are like, where's Becky?
[02:40:48.040 --> 02:40:50.160]   Why is she not, you know, not only responding to texts
[02:40:50.160 --> 02:40:52.960]   but remembering my birthday or whatever I forget.
[02:40:52.960 --> 02:40:54.160]   And that doesn't feel good to me
[02:40:54.160 --> 02:40:55.880]   because I used to do more of that.
[02:40:55.880 --> 02:40:59.360]   And so no one has it all figured out.
[02:40:59.360 --> 02:41:02.940]   Like humans, I think it's a remarkably complicated,
[02:41:02.940 --> 02:41:04.280]   remarkably imperfect.
[02:41:04.280 --> 02:41:07.120]   We all have parts of us that feel really good.
[02:41:07.120 --> 02:41:09.520]   And we, maybe some of us play up those parts
[02:41:09.520 --> 02:41:10.840]   more than others.
[02:41:10.840 --> 02:41:15.840]   And we all have parts of us that feel confusing,
[02:41:15.840 --> 02:41:19.320]   maybe have some shame, feel, you know,
[02:41:20.600 --> 02:41:23.440]   I don't know, just more complicated.
[02:41:23.440 --> 02:41:27.400]   And so at least want to get that out there about myself.
[02:41:27.400 --> 02:41:29.040]   - Oh, I really appreciate you sharing.
[02:41:29.040 --> 02:41:32.640]   And I want to be clear if I was at all unclear
[02:41:32.640 --> 02:41:36.920]   that I certainly don't hold up these ultra performers
[02:41:36.920 --> 02:41:38.280]   in all domains on a pedestal.
[02:41:38.280 --> 02:41:41.040]   I think they're in a very precarious place
[02:41:41.040 --> 02:41:42.440]   inside and outside.
[02:41:42.440 --> 02:41:44.760]   They've essentially given up all their power and agency
[02:41:44.760 --> 02:41:46.880]   to one incoming failure.
[02:41:46.880 --> 02:41:48.160]   And maybe they never experienced it
[02:41:48.160 --> 02:41:49.400]   and they get to the end without having done,
[02:41:49.400 --> 02:41:51.560]   but what a terrible way to live anyway.
[02:41:51.560 --> 02:41:53.600]   I've always looked up since I was little
[02:41:53.600 --> 02:41:56.760]   to people that really took a unique path.
[02:41:56.760 --> 02:42:00.040]   I've always found that they, yes,
[02:42:00.040 --> 02:42:03.620]   accomplished tremendous things and they have interesting,
[02:42:03.620 --> 02:42:04.920]   sometimes painful flaws.
[02:42:04.920 --> 02:42:08.040]   Like I'm a huge fan of the late neurologist
[02:42:08.040 --> 02:42:09.280]   and writer Oliver Sacks.
[02:42:09.280 --> 02:42:11.920]   Very, very incredible man, very complicated life.
[02:42:11.920 --> 02:42:12.760]   - Incredible.
[02:42:12.760 --> 02:42:14.680]   - You know, if you read his books, his autobiography,
[02:42:14.680 --> 02:42:17.400]   which I highly recommend everybody do
[02:42:17.400 --> 02:42:20.900]   if you're interested in science and just animals
[02:42:20.900 --> 02:42:23.800]   and a life uniquely lived.
[02:42:23.800 --> 02:42:24.640]   He's a really good example.
[02:42:24.640 --> 02:42:25.640]   And there are a bunch of other examples
[02:42:25.640 --> 02:42:27.240]   that are meaningful to me.
[02:42:27.240 --> 02:42:28.720]   Certainly not somebody who, you know,
[02:42:28.720 --> 02:42:31.100]   he couldn't do an experiment to save his life.
[02:42:31.100 --> 02:42:34.720]   He was moved out of multiple universities and places,
[02:42:34.720 --> 02:42:37.520]   you know, a very, very complicated character.
[02:42:37.520 --> 02:42:39.100]   Had a methamphetamine addiction,
[02:42:39.100 --> 02:42:42.400]   was a closet homosexual, came out later in life
[02:42:42.400 --> 02:42:45.160]   and was then at long periods of time on his own.
[02:42:45.160 --> 02:42:49.160]   And anyway, I've had a great relationship later in life.
[02:42:49.160 --> 02:42:51.880]   Very interesting person.
[02:42:51.880 --> 02:42:55.380]   Became that way and found his passion
[02:42:55.380 --> 02:42:58.620]   by realizing how terrible he was at certain things,
[02:42:58.620 --> 02:43:00.840]   including certain branches of medicine.
[02:43:00.840 --> 02:43:03.040]   So I think that trying many things
[02:43:03.040 --> 02:43:06.040]   and being really realistic about whether or not
[02:43:06.040 --> 02:43:09.000]   something's for us or not is the key.
[02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:11.000]   But then I guess the question becomes,
[02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:13.000]   and this must be so hard from the perspective of parenting,
[02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:14.680]   but also just in terms of guiding ourselves
[02:43:14.680 --> 02:43:16.200]   through life is, you know,
[02:43:16.200 --> 02:43:18.320]   how much friction do we experience before we say,
[02:43:18.320 --> 02:43:19.160]   you know what?
[02:43:19.160 --> 02:43:22.340]   Like, I'm not a musician and I'm cool with that.
[02:43:22.340 --> 02:43:25.080]   I love music, but I'm going to put my efforts
[02:43:25.080 --> 02:43:25.960]   into these other things.
[02:43:25.960 --> 02:43:28.080]   And, you know, this thing comes more easily for me.
[02:43:28.080 --> 02:43:29.360]   There, you know, I do think we have a lot
[02:43:29.360 --> 02:43:30.840]   of natural tendencies and I feel like,
[02:43:30.840 --> 02:43:32.040]   especially in the United States,
[02:43:32.040 --> 02:43:34.120]   there's been this complicated relationship
[02:43:34.120 --> 02:43:35.500]   with parenting and education,
[02:43:35.500 --> 02:43:39.360]   whereby we don't want to push people to their own,
[02:43:39.360 --> 02:43:41.320]   you know, like suffering and demise,
[02:43:41.320 --> 02:43:43.560]   but we also have to avoid not pushing them
[02:43:43.560 --> 02:43:45.440]   because then they don't ever find
[02:43:45.440 --> 02:43:46.960]   what they are proficient in
[02:43:46.960 --> 02:43:50.280]   and they don't learn that overcoming friction thing.
[02:43:50.280 --> 02:43:52.000]   So it's tricky.
[02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:54.200]   I do believe everyone has a unique expression
[02:43:54.200 --> 02:43:56.040]   of themselves in life, whatever that is.
[02:43:56.040 --> 02:43:57.360]   It doesn't have to be in professional life,
[02:43:57.360 --> 02:43:59.600]   but you have to try a lot of different things.
[02:43:59.600 --> 02:44:03.320]   And, you know, how, at what point you bail out.
[02:44:03.320 --> 02:44:05.400]   I mean, I've had few in my lab,
[02:44:05.400 --> 02:44:07.080]   but I've spoken to graduate students and postdocs
[02:44:07.080 --> 02:44:08.920]   where I had to say, you know what?
[02:44:08.920 --> 02:44:10.400]   I actually had this conversation with a postdoc.
[02:44:10.400 --> 02:44:11.240]   I was like, you know what?
[02:44:11.240 --> 02:44:12.520]   You're a really good scientist.
[02:44:12.520 --> 02:44:14.160]   You're never going to be a professor.
[02:44:14.160 --> 02:44:16.080]   Let's get you a job in biotech.
[02:44:16.080 --> 02:44:18.080]   And they were like, oh, they thought their whole life
[02:44:18.080 --> 02:44:18.960]   they were going to be a professor.
[02:44:18.960 --> 02:44:20.320]   I'm like, you're not.
[02:44:20.320 --> 02:44:23.280]   And the data are the following, which point to that.
[02:44:23.280 --> 02:44:24.360]   And it's kind of devastating,
[02:44:24.360 --> 02:44:26.440]   but then years later they thanked me
[02:44:26.440 --> 02:44:27.800]   or they thanked me in that case.
[02:44:27.800 --> 02:44:28.640]   - Yeah.
[02:44:28.640 --> 02:44:30.640]   - A few others probably cursed me, but.
[02:44:30.640 --> 02:44:35.040]   So how do you know when to keep pushing your kid
[02:44:35.040 --> 02:44:38.120]   to even engage in something?
[02:44:38.120 --> 02:44:40.440]   Like maybe they're the kid that always
[02:44:41.520 --> 02:44:42.640]   is picked last for the team,
[02:44:42.640 --> 02:44:44.600]   but you know, they should play sports.
[02:44:44.600 --> 02:44:47.800]   - So I guess my first reaction is I'm reacting
[02:44:47.800 --> 02:44:48.680]   to the word pushing.
[02:44:48.680 --> 02:44:50.920]   'Cause I'm not sure that's the,
[02:44:50.920 --> 02:44:54.360]   like the verb I would think about.
[02:44:54.360 --> 02:44:56.080]   Because I think the idea of pushing your kid,
[02:44:56.080 --> 02:44:57.640]   even like how much do I push?
[02:44:57.640 --> 02:45:01.520]   There's a lot about us there is like, is that my desire?
[02:45:01.520 --> 02:45:03.600]   - I guess I grew up in a town where a lot of kids got pushed.
[02:45:03.600 --> 02:45:06.120]   - Oh, I mean, I grew up in a town where every kid got pushed.
[02:45:06.120 --> 02:45:08.800]   So maybe that's why I know something about it, right?
[02:45:08.800 --> 02:45:10.080]   I mean, I think we see this all the time
[02:45:10.080 --> 02:45:12.400]   and it goes back to actually what side of the tennis court,
[02:45:12.400 --> 02:45:13.640]   like whose feelings are whose?
[02:45:13.640 --> 02:45:18.640]   Like, is this my unlived dreams as a athlete in my youth?
[02:45:18.640 --> 02:45:22.120]   Or is this actually about my kids' soccer skills?
[02:45:22.120 --> 02:45:25.520]   You know, I think parents watching their kids playing sports
[02:45:25.520 --> 02:45:30.520]   is a prime example of am I living out my unfulfilled dreams
[02:45:30.520 --> 02:45:34.400]   and projecting that onto my daughter?
[02:45:34.400 --> 02:45:36.520]   Or does my daughter like soccer?
[02:45:36.520 --> 02:45:39.240]   And like, how can I really differentiate those, right?
[02:45:40.080 --> 02:45:42.320]   I think actually though, making it back to that,
[02:45:42.320 --> 02:45:45.240]   a lot of this actually goes back to frustration tolerance
[02:45:45.240 --> 02:45:48.280]   and why it matters so much to me.
[02:45:48.280 --> 02:45:51.560]   Like my approach to teaching frustration tolerance,
[02:45:51.560 --> 02:45:54.920]   which is like a hidden gem we have here at "Couldn't Decide",
[02:45:54.920 --> 02:45:58.120]   I really want, I want it to be in every school.
[02:45:58.120 --> 02:45:59.440]   I think it needs to be in every school
[02:45:59.440 --> 02:46:02.200]   and I want to describe it to you, okay?
[02:46:02.200 --> 02:46:04.160]   So I literally have this graph, it's helpful.
[02:46:04.160 --> 02:46:05.280]   And I know you like to write things down too
[02:46:05.280 --> 02:46:06.160]   to make it concrete.
[02:46:06.200 --> 02:46:10.560]   We're like, point one is not knowing how to do something.
[02:46:10.560 --> 02:46:11.400]   Okay?
[02:46:11.400 --> 02:46:13.760]   And point two, which is very far away,
[02:46:13.760 --> 02:46:16.960]   is let's say knowing how to do it or being very proficient.
[02:46:16.960 --> 02:46:18.720]   This could be soccer.
[02:46:18.720 --> 02:46:20.800]   I think a good example is reading.
[02:46:20.800 --> 02:46:21.640]   Okay?
[02:46:21.640 --> 02:46:24.720]   Like you, everybody starts out not knowing how to read.
[02:46:24.720 --> 02:46:26.240]   And let's say not everybody,
[02:46:26.240 --> 02:46:28.840]   but a lot of people learn how to read.
[02:46:28.840 --> 02:46:34.080]   The space between not knowing and knowing,
[02:46:34.080 --> 02:46:36.640]   I call the learning space.
[02:46:36.640 --> 02:46:38.200]   It has a name and it's helpful to know
[02:46:38.200 --> 02:46:39.320]   where you are in a map.
[02:46:39.320 --> 02:46:43.160]   And the learning space has one feeling
[02:46:43.160 --> 02:46:45.800]   that you're supposed to have, frustration.
[02:46:45.800 --> 02:46:50.160]   That is the feeling you're supposed to have.
[02:46:50.160 --> 02:46:54.160]   And we have this idea that we get from not knowing
[02:46:54.160 --> 02:46:57.160]   to knowing like this.
[02:46:57.160 --> 02:46:59.560]   - It's because of those damn "Star Wars" movies.
[02:46:59.560 --> 02:47:00.760]   And, oh no, actually "Star Wars"
[02:47:00.760 --> 02:47:03.840]   incorporated some frustration, but it's because of movies.
[02:47:03.840 --> 02:47:05.640]   Boom, you're supposed to just have the skill
[02:47:05.640 --> 02:47:07.440]   'cause you picked up the rock or the sword
[02:47:07.440 --> 02:47:09.560]   or the pen or the wand.
[02:47:09.560 --> 02:47:12.400]   - And now it's because if you think about the circuitry
[02:47:12.400 --> 02:47:14.800]   that kids get used to with dopamine
[02:47:14.800 --> 02:47:19.800]   and the space between wanting and having in general is low.
[02:47:19.800 --> 02:47:23.360]   Because when you don't know something, you want to know it.
[02:47:23.360 --> 02:47:24.880]   Here, you do know it.
[02:47:24.880 --> 02:47:28.600]   Our tolerance and our kids' tolerance
[02:47:28.600 --> 02:47:32.120]   for wanting and not having is so low
[02:47:32.120 --> 02:47:35.640]   that what's so sad is the learning space
[02:47:35.640 --> 02:47:39.400]   has gotten massively compressed and people fear frustration.
[02:47:39.400 --> 02:47:41.320]   This image, when I've gone over this with kids
[02:47:41.320 --> 02:47:42.560]   and even teachers, I know teachers
[02:47:42.560 --> 02:47:43.720]   who teach this in their class.
[02:47:43.720 --> 02:47:45.560]   Okay, today we're gonna learn this new thing.
[02:47:45.560 --> 02:47:47.960]   We're gonna learn whatever it is,
[02:47:47.960 --> 02:47:49.720]   how to read a short word.
[02:47:49.720 --> 02:47:53.440]   Everybody in this class is here, not knowing.
[02:47:53.440 --> 02:47:56.640]   Everybody in this class is going to get here.
[02:47:56.640 --> 02:47:59.600]   And probably today, most of us,
[02:47:59.600 --> 02:48:00.520]   and you can actually do it in a map,
[02:48:00.520 --> 02:48:01.640]   are gonna be right here.
[02:48:01.640 --> 02:48:02.720]   What does this say?
[02:48:02.720 --> 02:48:03.760]   The learning space.
[02:48:03.760 --> 02:48:06.080]   How are we supposed to feel
[02:48:06.080 --> 02:48:07.360]   when we're in the learning space?
[02:48:07.360 --> 02:48:09.640]   The class can say, frustrated.
[02:48:09.640 --> 02:48:11.960]   Okay, here's an interesting assignment,
[02:48:11.960 --> 02:48:13.000]   different than you think.
[02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:15.040]   The goal today is not to tell me
[02:48:15.040 --> 02:48:18.200]   if you can read the letters that are in front of you.
[02:48:18.200 --> 02:48:21.640]   I want you to raise your hand when you feel frustrated,
[02:48:21.640 --> 02:48:22.480]   which feels like this.
[02:48:22.480 --> 02:48:23.720]   Oh, I can't do it.
[02:48:23.720 --> 02:48:25.040]   Because I'm gonna come up to you
[02:48:25.040 --> 02:48:26.280]   and I'm gonna give you a high five.
[02:48:26.280 --> 02:48:28.360]   And I'm gonna say, you are in the learning space.
[02:48:28.360 --> 02:48:29.280]   You are learning.
[02:48:29.280 --> 02:48:30.520]   How amazing is that?
[02:48:30.520 --> 02:48:31.640]   Like, Andrew, I really believe
[02:48:31.640 --> 02:48:34.760]   this has the power to change learning.
[02:48:34.760 --> 02:48:36.640]   Because then when we talk about proficiency,
[02:48:36.640 --> 02:48:39.240]   or when we talk about years from now,
[02:48:39.240 --> 02:48:40.680]   my kid is saying, this happens all the time.
[02:48:40.680 --> 02:48:42.520]   I get questions about this all the time.
[02:48:42.520 --> 02:48:44.760]   My kid says they want to do whatever it is.
[02:48:44.760 --> 02:48:46.520]   It could be a coding class.
[02:48:46.520 --> 02:48:48.440]   It could be a lacrosse class.
[02:48:48.440 --> 02:48:49.480]   And they do it once.
[02:48:49.480 --> 02:48:51.240]   And then they always come home and they say,
[02:48:51.240 --> 02:48:52.600]   I want to do it, I quit.
[02:48:52.600 --> 02:48:55.200]   Or maybe they're on a swim team and they want to quit.
[02:48:55.200 --> 02:48:56.520]   Do I let my kid quit?
[02:48:56.520 --> 02:48:58.080]   Right?
[02:48:58.080 --> 02:49:00.600]   To me, the question is actually like,
[02:49:00.600 --> 02:49:05.040]   most likely none of our kids are gonna be Olympic swimmers
[02:49:05.040 --> 02:49:06.520]   or like professional basketball players.
[02:49:06.520 --> 02:49:08.160]   I think about this a lot with youth sports.
[02:49:08.160 --> 02:49:11.000]   The whole goal in my mind for most people with youth sports,
[02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:12.840]   not everyone, but most,
[02:49:12.840 --> 02:49:15.160]   is learning how to deal with frustration,
[02:49:15.160 --> 02:49:17.720]   learning how to do things you thought you couldn't do,
[02:49:17.720 --> 02:49:20.880]   character, sharing, being a good teammate,
[02:49:20.880 --> 02:49:22.320]   sportsmanship, right?
[02:49:22.320 --> 02:49:23.800]   All those things are hard skills to learn.
[02:49:23.800 --> 02:49:25.840]   So the reason I'm signing my kid up for basketball
[02:49:25.840 --> 02:49:27.560]   is actually just 'cause it's like a good medium
[02:49:27.560 --> 02:49:29.120]   for all those things.
[02:49:29.120 --> 02:49:33.560]   And so I want to be sure that if my kid is quitting,
[02:49:33.560 --> 02:49:35.320]   it's not because they're escaping
[02:49:35.320 --> 02:49:38.040]   the very, very natural learning space
[02:49:38.040 --> 02:49:42.000]   that is so important to being in life.
[02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:42.840]   And this happened actually,
[02:49:42.840 --> 02:49:44.760]   my oldest wanted to quit baseball.
[02:49:44.760 --> 02:49:47.440]   He'd played for years and he wanted to quit.
[02:49:47.440 --> 02:49:51.280]   And the conversation we ended up having was,
[02:49:51.280 --> 02:49:54.240]   look, let's wait to the end of the season.
[02:49:54.240 --> 02:49:56.000]   Like, and this goes back to values.
[02:49:56.000 --> 02:49:59.440]   It's not we don't quit, but like in our family,
[02:49:59.440 --> 02:50:01.960]   we really value and try as much as we can
[02:50:01.960 --> 02:50:04.320]   to keep our commitments
[02:50:04.320 --> 02:50:06.640]   and not just to ourselves, to each other.
[02:50:06.640 --> 02:50:08.400]   And so the rest of the season,
[02:50:08.400 --> 02:50:09.840]   you might be thinking all the time,
[02:50:09.840 --> 02:50:11.080]   I don't want to be doing this.
[02:50:11.080 --> 02:50:12.920]   And again, in my head, I'm thinking,
[02:50:12.920 --> 02:50:14.600]   good, that's like a good life experience
[02:50:14.600 --> 02:50:15.640]   to watch yourself go through that
[02:50:15.640 --> 02:50:16.880]   as long as it's not toxic.
[02:50:16.880 --> 02:50:19.120]   And at the end, you know, we'll talk about it.
[02:50:19.120 --> 02:50:20.120]   Interestingly enough,
[02:50:20.120 --> 02:50:22.480]   he had the best baseball season he'd ever had.
[02:50:22.480 --> 02:50:25.200]   He had a grand slam, which no shade to baseball,
[02:50:25.200 --> 02:50:28.360]   that's as exciting as youth baseball ever gets, right?
[02:50:28.360 --> 02:50:31.880]   And still, he was like, I think I'm done.
[02:50:31.880 --> 02:50:34.640]   Like, I just want to, and I felt really good about that.
[02:50:34.640 --> 02:50:36.920]   I was like, look, you ended on like,
[02:50:36.920 --> 02:50:38.280]   you were playing really well.
[02:50:38.280 --> 02:50:40.040]   It wasn't just 'cause you got moved down
[02:50:40.040 --> 02:50:41.280]   in the batting order.
[02:50:41.280 --> 02:50:42.960]   Like, if that's the reason why
[02:50:42.960 --> 02:50:44.560]   Mike could get moved down to the batting order,
[02:50:44.560 --> 02:50:46.040]   they're not starting on basketball.
[02:50:46.040 --> 02:50:46.880]   I hear this all the time.
[02:50:46.880 --> 02:50:48.320]   Now they want to quit.
[02:50:48.320 --> 02:50:49.960]   I don't have any rigid rules,
[02:50:49.960 --> 02:50:52.840]   but if that becomes a pattern,
[02:50:52.840 --> 02:50:55.360]   that worries me, or not worries me,
[02:50:55.360 --> 02:50:58.360]   but forget youth sports.
[02:50:58.360 --> 02:51:00.640]   That's just not a great circuitry
[02:51:00.640 --> 02:51:03.760]   that would be conducive with kind of resilience
[02:51:03.760 --> 02:51:05.920]   and confidence in adulthood.
[02:51:05.920 --> 02:51:10.720]   - Look, I love, love, love this concept,
[02:51:10.720 --> 02:51:12.960]   which I believe to be entirely true
[02:51:12.960 --> 02:51:16.520]   that the learning space between unskilled and skilled,
[02:51:16.520 --> 02:51:17.600]   if you will. - Yes, that's what it is.
[02:51:17.600 --> 02:51:20.800]   - Is characterized by the feeling of frustration
[02:51:20.800 --> 02:51:22.720]   in mind and body. - Yes.
[02:51:22.720 --> 02:51:24.560]   - I don't want to rattle off another experiment,
[02:51:24.560 --> 02:51:26.840]   but there is just oh so much data.
[02:51:26.840 --> 02:51:29.280]   I'll share this with you offline.
[02:51:29.280 --> 02:51:32.560]   The papers that is showing that brain plasticity,
[02:51:32.560 --> 02:51:34.000]   changes in neural circuitry,
[02:51:34.000 --> 02:51:37.000]   only occur when the chemical milieu of the brain
[02:51:37.000 --> 02:51:38.480]   is different than it normally is.
[02:51:38.480 --> 02:51:41.200]   Otherwise, how would the brain know it should change?
[02:51:41.200 --> 02:51:44.920]   So what sets the context for massive change
[02:51:44.920 --> 02:51:46.240]   in our neural circuitry
[02:51:46.240 --> 02:51:49.000]   is when there's a lot of adrenaline in the body.
[02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:50.200]   Sorry, folks, it's true.
[02:51:50.200 --> 02:51:51.800]   Adrenaline, also called epinephrine,
[02:51:51.800 --> 02:51:53.920]   and norepinephrine released in the brain.
[02:51:53.920 --> 02:51:55.440]   Now, you don't want to be in a state of panic
[02:51:55.440 --> 02:51:58.760]   or stress to the point where you're debilitated,
[02:51:58.760 --> 02:52:02.240]   but that shift in the chemical milieu
[02:52:02.240 --> 02:52:07.120]   sets the stage for rewiring of connections between neurons.
[02:52:07.120 --> 02:52:08.840]   I mean, this is known at the molecular level,
[02:52:08.840 --> 02:52:10.000]   it's known at the cellular level,
[02:52:10.000 --> 02:52:11.000]   it's known at the circuit level,
[02:52:11.000 --> 02:52:13.000]   and I'm excited to share that literature with you
[02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:16.160]   because it just basically is a bunch of nerd speak
[02:52:16.160 --> 02:52:18.760]   and numbers to support the fact
[02:52:18.760 --> 02:52:22.080]   that you're nailing it right in the bullseye,
[02:52:22.080 --> 02:52:23.960]   which is without frustration,
[02:52:23.960 --> 02:52:26.320]   there is no rewiring of the neural circuits.
[02:52:26.320 --> 02:52:28.320]   And if you think about it, it had to be that way.
[02:52:28.320 --> 02:52:30.680]   Otherwise, why would the circuits change?
[02:52:30.680 --> 02:52:35.120]   So that the error signal is what sets plasticity in motion.
[02:52:35.120 --> 02:52:37.120]   Now, the actual rewiring occurs during sleep.
[02:52:37.120 --> 02:52:38.400]   So this is my reminder to make sure
[02:52:38.400 --> 02:52:39.400]   that your kids get enough sleep
[02:52:39.400 --> 02:52:40.360]   'cause that's when the actual,
[02:52:40.360 --> 02:52:42.280]   this is the phenomenon of not being able to do something,
[02:52:42.280 --> 02:52:43.800]   coming back a few days or weeks later,
[02:52:43.800 --> 02:52:44.760]   and you're like, "Can do it."
[02:52:44.760 --> 02:52:46.160]   Well, 'cause it happened in sleep,
[02:52:46.160 --> 02:52:47.960]   the final portion of the rewiring.
[02:52:47.960 --> 02:52:50.320]   - That's why phones shouldn't be in the bedroom for kids.
[02:52:50.320 --> 02:52:55.320]   - I think 75% of people between the age of seven and 18
[02:52:55.320 --> 02:52:58.520]   are massively sleep deprived.
[02:52:58.520 --> 02:53:01.680]   And there's the neural rewiring deficits
[02:53:01.680 --> 02:53:03.880]   associated with that are serious.
[02:53:03.880 --> 02:53:06.160]   And these are what we call sensitive periods.
[02:53:06.160 --> 02:53:08.120]   I like sensitive periods more than critical periods
[02:53:08.120 --> 02:53:10.200]   because critical periods imply an open and shut.
[02:53:10.200 --> 02:53:13.760]   Sensitive is there's a tapering, but it does taper.
[02:53:13.760 --> 02:53:17.600]   - So this unskilled to skilled
[02:53:17.600 --> 02:53:20.160]   and frustration in the learning space model,
[02:53:20.160 --> 02:53:22.000]   this is part of something that you're putting together now.
[02:53:22.000 --> 02:53:23.440]   Could you expand on that? - I already have it.
[02:53:23.440 --> 02:53:25.560]   I mean, our Frustration Tolerance Program,
[02:53:25.560 --> 02:53:29.720]   it's a workshop, it's within our membership, right?
[02:53:29.720 --> 02:53:32.600]   So it's one of 30 workshops.
[02:53:32.600 --> 02:53:36.200]   To me, it's one where, the thing is no parents say,
[02:53:36.200 --> 02:53:37.440]   "Dr. Becky, what I'm really dealing with
[02:53:37.440 --> 02:53:39.040]   "is low frustration tolerance."
[02:53:39.040 --> 02:53:41.440]   They'll say, "My kid is having tantrums,"
[02:53:41.440 --> 02:53:42.960]   or, "They won't do their homework."
[02:53:42.960 --> 02:53:44.880]   Or, "Kids with ADHD
[02:53:44.880 --> 02:53:47.040]   "tend to have low frustration tolerance," right?
[02:53:47.040 --> 02:53:50.080]   So to me, it's like one of the first things
[02:53:50.080 --> 02:53:51.960]   I recommend to new members where I say,
[02:53:51.960 --> 02:53:53.960]   "Okay, you might, like, this is the thing.
[02:53:53.960 --> 02:53:55.760]   "This is like the key thing
[02:53:55.760 --> 02:53:58.000]   "that underlies a lot of tantrums.
[02:53:58.000 --> 02:54:00.320]   "It underlies entitlement.
[02:54:00.320 --> 02:54:02.240]   "It underlies not sharing.
[02:54:02.240 --> 02:54:03.800]   "It underlies why you throw the board game
[02:54:03.800 --> 02:54:04.840]   "when you're about to lose.
[02:54:04.840 --> 02:54:06.120]   "It underlies quitting.
[02:54:06.120 --> 02:54:07.120]   "It's not homework."
[02:54:07.120 --> 02:54:10.120]   And again, the MGI, the Most Generous Interpretation
[02:54:10.120 --> 02:54:14.160]   is wait, right, the commonality in all those situations
[02:54:14.160 --> 02:54:16.360]   is my kid is frustrated.
[02:54:16.360 --> 02:54:19.520]   And if what they're learning or what they've practiced
[02:54:19.520 --> 02:54:23.560]   is when I feel frustrated, it's so intense
[02:54:23.560 --> 02:54:25.520]   that sometimes I think, like, do our kids learn
[02:54:25.520 --> 02:54:28.640]   that their emotions operate on a dimmer switch
[02:54:28.640 --> 02:54:30.240]   or an on/off switch?
[02:54:30.240 --> 02:54:32.440]   We want our kids to operate on a dimmer.
[02:54:32.440 --> 02:54:34.640]   Like you said, if you're at a 10 out of 10,
[02:54:34.640 --> 02:54:36.400]   nothing, you can't operate.
[02:54:36.400 --> 02:54:38.280]   But if every time, and I'm so interested
[02:54:38.280 --> 02:54:40.640]   in this literature you mentioned, 'cause I was thinking,
[02:54:40.640 --> 02:54:42.320]   what would happen in the first number of years
[02:54:42.320 --> 02:54:45.360]   of a kid's life if every time they're frustrated,
[02:54:45.360 --> 02:54:48.560]   well-intentioned, but again, just under-resourced parents,
[02:54:48.560 --> 02:54:49.400]   turn it off?
[02:54:49.400 --> 02:54:52.640]   Then what I think would happen, and I'm wondering,
[02:54:52.640 --> 02:54:57.080]   is then something that could be like a five out of 10,
[02:54:57.080 --> 02:54:59.800]   I feel like would feel like a 10 out of 10,
[02:54:59.800 --> 02:55:02.680]   because you never had a dimmer, right?
[02:55:02.680 --> 02:55:05.000]   Because if you only operated when a light went on
[02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:08.000]   with always going off, then even if over time,
[02:55:08.000 --> 02:55:09.960]   years later, the light was at a five,
[02:55:09.960 --> 02:55:13.360]   it still could feel blinding, right?
[02:55:13.360 --> 02:55:15.360]   And so this idea of a dimmer,
[02:55:15.360 --> 02:55:17.480]   you want your kids when they're frustrated,
[02:55:17.480 --> 02:55:20.200]   that's what frustration tolerance is.
[02:55:20.200 --> 02:55:23.120]   Nobody says, "I'm frustrated, I can't read, yay!"
[02:55:23.120 --> 02:55:24.520]   No one says that.
[02:55:24.520 --> 02:55:27.880]   But if it kind of comes up, "Oh, there's that light,"
[02:55:27.880 --> 02:55:31.160]   we want their bodies to think, "Okay, all I need to do,
[02:55:31.160 --> 02:55:34.560]   "and I have skills to get my nine out of 10 to an eight,
[02:55:34.560 --> 02:55:38.160]   "an eight to a seven, and when I'm at a seven,
[02:55:38.160 --> 02:55:40.040]   "that's where learning happens."
[02:55:40.040 --> 02:55:43.280]   That's very different than it's at a nine,
[02:55:43.280 --> 02:55:46.440]   and kind of like, "Who's gonna turn it off for me?"
[02:55:46.440 --> 02:55:48.200]   Or the reason in those situations,
[02:55:48.200 --> 02:55:49.960]   kids say, "I'm not doing my homework,"
[02:55:49.960 --> 02:55:52.400]   is they don't have the skills to bring it to a seven.
[02:55:52.400 --> 02:55:54.720]   And so their choice is to stay at a nine or 10 out of 10,
[02:55:54.720 --> 02:55:58.240]   which no human can do, or walk away and bring it to a zero.
[02:55:58.240 --> 02:55:59.080]   And so what I'm saying
[02:55:59.080 --> 02:56:00.440]   is our frustration tolerance workshop,
[02:56:00.440 --> 02:56:02.080]   which I want every parent to take,
[02:56:02.080 --> 02:56:04.080]   but I also just want to get into schools,
[02:56:04.080 --> 02:56:09.000]   is literally the thing that helps you teach your kids
[02:56:09.000 --> 02:56:12.240]   how to get frustration tolerance, how to...
[02:56:12.240 --> 02:56:13.080]   You really can do this.
[02:56:13.080 --> 02:56:15.920]   It sounds sick, but like, you can get your kids
[02:56:15.920 --> 02:56:18.080]   to like being in the learning space,
[02:56:18.080 --> 02:56:20.880]   to be like, "I'm gonna thrive here.
[02:56:20.880 --> 02:56:23.240]   "The good feeling is eventually gonna come.
[02:56:23.240 --> 02:56:25.560]   "I'm relatively comfortable here
[02:56:25.560 --> 02:56:27.560]   "because I just have watched myself
[02:56:27.560 --> 02:56:29.280]   "survive it that many times."
[02:56:29.280 --> 02:56:32.360]   And so the benefits of that workshop,
[02:56:32.360 --> 02:56:35.680]   and it just, the program is not only tantrums,
[02:56:35.680 --> 02:56:38.120]   but actually it is a lot in academics.
[02:56:38.120 --> 02:56:42.160]   'Cause that, so many times when kids have issues in school,
[02:56:42.160 --> 02:56:45.040]   I'm not, ADHD is real, dyslexia is real.
[02:56:45.040 --> 02:56:47.000]   That definitely can be a component.
[02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:49.200]   But so many times,
[02:56:49.200 --> 02:56:52.440]   it's actually an issue of frustration tolerance.
[02:56:52.440 --> 02:56:55.960]   And that's often not kind of labeled for parents.
[02:56:57.240 --> 02:57:00.200]   - I'm realizing as you're saying this,
[02:57:00.200 --> 02:57:02.840]   that the literature that I'm aware of about stress
[02:57:02.840 --> 02:57:05.280]   and trauma is actually relevant here
[02:57:05.280 --> 02:57:07.400]   in an interesting and perhaps surprising way,
[02:57:07.400 --> 02:57:09.800]   whereby, this thing I said earlier,
[02:57:09.800 --> 02:57:11.400]   the brain only changes under conditions
[02:57:11.400 --> 02:57:14.440]   where norepinephrine and epinephrine are released.
[02:57:14.440 --> 02:57:17.240]   There is such a thing as one trial learning
[02:57:17.240 --> 02:57:20.040]   and it's associated with negative experiences.
[02:57:20.040 --> 02:57:21.920]   And the reason negative experiences
[02:57:21.920 --> 02:57:24.640]   create such robust learning in only one trial
[02:57:24.640 --> 02:57:26.840]   is because there's a massive amount of epinephrine
[02:57:26.840 --> 02:57:28.880]   and norepinephrine and other neurochemicals released.
[02:57:28.880 --> 02:57:31.160]   So it's stamped into the nervous system.
[02:57:31.160 --> 02:57:33.520]   But learning of things we want to learn
[02:57:33.520 --> 02:57:36.600]   relies on the same neurochemicals.
[02:57:36.600 --> 02:57:39.480]   I mean, there's a wild and really cool literature
[02:57:39.480 --> 02:57:42.480]   from a guy named James McGaugh who showed that like,
[02:57:42.480 --> 02:57:44.440]   if you spike adrenaline before learning,
[02:57:44.440 --> 02:57:46.680]   the learning is much faster and much more durable.
[02:57:46.680 --> 02:57:49.080]   If you spike adrenaline after learning,
[02:57:49.080 --> 02:57:51.040]   turns out the learning is more durable.
[02:57:51.040 --> 02:57:54.760]   Now we can't start getting into kind of,
[02:57:54.760 --> 02:57:57.200]   biohacking experiments on kids or themselves,
[02:57:57.200 --> 02:58:00.280]   but that the adrenaline is supposed to come
[02:58:00.280 --> 02:58:02.480]   during the learning itself, which is what you're saying.
[02:58:02.480 --> 02:58:07.480]   But the problem is if we stop once we're frustrated,
[02:58:07.480 --> 02:58:10.920]   we get the increase in adrenaline and norepinephrine,
[02:58:10.920 --> 02:58:13.240]   and again, other neurochemicals as well.
[02:58:13.240 --> 02:58:15.640]   But then the perception is
[02:58:15.640 --> 02:58:17.520]   that the plasticity loop is closed there.
[02:58:17.520 --> 02:58:18.360]   So what did you learn?
[02:58:18.360 --> 02:58:20.000]   When I do hard things, I get frustrated.
[02:58:20.000 --> 02:58:23.240]   When I stop, the frustration goes away.
[02:58:23.240 --> 02:58:24.080]   That's all you learn.
[02:58:24.080 --> 02:58:25.840]   In the same way that somebody exposed to trauma,
[02:58:25.840 --> 02:58:26.880]   this underlies the basis
[02:58:26.880 --> 02:58:28.840]   of almost all modern trauma therapies.
[02:58:28.840 --> 02:58:30.640]   It's in the right setting,
[02:58:30.640 --> 02:58:34.240]   take people back through it sequentially,
[02:58:34.240 --> 02:58:37.600]   let them experience that and start to desensitize to it
[02:58:37.600 --> 02:58:39.200]   so they can complete that loop.
[02:58:39.200 --> 02:58:40.040]   - Yeah, that's exactly right.
[02:58:40.040 --> 02:58:42.480]   - And so I think it's so important
[02:58:42.480 --> 02:58:44.400]   to push through frustration.
[02:58:44.400 --> 02:58:46.360]   And I think it's so important as you,
[02:58:46.360 --> 02:58:48.840]   I'm disagreeing with you here clearly,
[02:58:48.840 --> 02:58:52.400]   but that oftentimes that frustration can last
[02:58:52.400 --> 02:58:53.840]   more than just the learning session.
[02:58:53.840 --> 02:58:56.800]   It can be weeks or months, or in some cases,
[02:58:56.800 --> 02:58:59.040]   a year of a really challenging course
[02:58:59.040 --> 02:59:01.640]   or a sports participation.
[02:59:01.640 --> 02:59:02.960]   And so that's where it gets tough
[02:59:02.960 --> 02:59:05.520]   because as empathic creatures, one hopes,
[02:59:05.520 --> 02:59:08.960]   we hate to see members of our own species suffer,
[02:59:08.960 --> 02:59:10.280]   especially our kids.
[02:59:10.280 --> 02:59:12.480]   And so it becomes this thing of like,
[02:59:12.480 --> 02:59:14.320]   do you let them opt out?
[02:59:14.320 --> 02:59:15.880]   Like, what did they learn by opting out?
[02:59:15.880 --> 02:59:17.720]   And that's where it gets really complicated
[02:59:17.720 --> 02:59:18.880]   'cause we also got a forebrain
[02:59:18.880 --> 02:59:20.400]   which can set all these different rules.
[02:59:20.640 --> 02:59:22.240]   And so-
[02:59:22.240 --> 02:59:24.640]   - But can I, I don't know about frustration for a year.
[02:59:24.640 --> 02:59:28.440]   I guess I always think how we experience a feeling
[02:59:28.440 --> 02:59:31.280]   is the feeling plus the story we tell ourselves
[02:59:31.280 --> 02:59:32.160]   about the feeling.
[02:59:32.160 --> 02:59:37.240]   And the feeling kind of is at a certain level,
[02:59:37.240 --> 02:59:39.720]   but the story we tell ourself about the feeling
[02:59:39.720 --> 02:59:41.560]   and what it means about us
[02:59:41.560 --> 02:59:44.240]   or how capable we are of coping with it,
[02:59:44.240 --> 02:59:47.600]   that can make a feeling that was here go to here.
[02:59:47.600 --> 02:59:49.160]   Something about frustration of a year,
[02:59:49.160 --> 02:59:52.880]   like it's interesting, we're talking so much about stories,
[02:59:52.880 --> 02:59:56.640]   but again, if one of the things I try as a parent
[02:59:56.640 --> 02:59:58.880]   is when my kid is saying,
[02:59:58.880 --> 03:00:00.320]   I don't know what would it be to quit?
[03:00:00.320 --> 03:00:05.320]   You know, I hate gymnastics, right?
[03:00:05.320 --> 03:00:08.480]   And you're thinking, okay, like, first of all,
[03:00:08.480 --> 03:00:10.280]   quitting is not always weak or wrong.
[03:00:10.280 --> 03:00:11.440]   Sometimes quitting is a very brave,
[03:00:11.440 --> 03:00:12.680]   awesome, great thing to do.
[03:00:12.680 --> 03:00:15.360]   - Definitely sometimes the absolute best thing to do.
[03:00:15.360 --> 03:00:16.480]   - A hundred percent.
[03:00:16.480 --> 03:00:18.120]   But as a parent sometimes, and I get this a lot,
[03:00:18.120 --> 03:00:20.160]   like I'm conflicted, like I don't know what's right.
[03:00:20.160 --> 03:00:22.120]   First of all, there's probably not a right.
[03:00:22.120 --> 03:00:25.000]   And again, our parenting never hangs on one decision.
[03:00:25.000 --> 03:00:26.600]   So just let that go.
[03:00:26.600 --> 03:00:31.200]   But I think what I would be curious to just experiment with,
[03:00:31.200 --> 03:00:33.200]   again, maybe it's because I'm so obsessed
[03:00:33.200 --> 03:00:36.600]   with frustration tolerance, especially in this world
[03:00:36.600 --> 03:00:39.480]   that is so working against frustration tolerance.
[03:00:39.480 --> 03:00:41.080]   I feel like it's like even more my duty
[03:00:41.080 --> 03:00:42.360]   as a parent to help.
[03:00:42.360 --> 03:00:44.520]   So I'm like, okay, let's just have an experiment
[03:00:44.520 --> 03:00:46.600]   where I would say, okay, talk to me about
[03:00:46.600 --> 03:00:47.800]   why you want to quit gymnastics.
[03:00:47.800 --> 03:00:49.960]   And I might know in the back of my head,
[03:00:49.960 --> 03:00:52.560]   maybe they're not as good as everyone anymore, right?
[03:00:52.560 --> 03:00:55.000]   Or maybe they just don't like it, who knows.
[03:00:55.000 --> 03:00:58.480]   But I might say, you know, look, maybe this isn't relevant.
[03:00:58.480 --> 03:01:02.200]   I'm thinking about when I did, you know,
[03:01:02.200 --> 03:01:04.000]   I'm thinking about a different sport.
[03:01:04.000 --> 03:01:06.840]   When I did track growing up.
[03:01:06.840 --> 03:01:08.840]   And there were like whole years where I was like,
[03:01:08.840 --> 03:01:11.120]   I love track, I love track.
[03:01:11.120 --> 03:01:12.480]   And I don't know if I ever told you this,
[03:01:12.480 --> 03:01:15.600]   but when I was 11, I hated track.
[03:01:15.600 --> 03:01:18.560]   I went from love to hate it.
[03:01:18.560 --> 03:01:21.560]   And part of it was, and again,
[03:01:21.560 --> 03:01:22.880]   say something kind of relevant to your kid.
[03:01:22.880 --> 03:01:24.960]   Part of it was there was a new kid at school
[03:01:24.960 --> 03:01:27.520]   and I was kind of the track star until she came in.
[03:01:27.520 --> 03:01:30.160]   And then I was like second and that just kind of stunk
[03:01:30.160 --> 03:01:32.440]   and no, I didn't tell myself it's okay.
[03:01:32.440 --> 03:01:34.400]   I kind of told myself this stinks every day.
[03:01:34.400 --> 03:01:37.160]   And part of it was all my friends were doing soccer
[03:01:37.160 --> 03:01:38.560]   and I kind of felt left out.
[03:01:38.560 --> 03:01:41.840]   But I finished the year and the next year
[03:01:41.840 --> 03:01:43.360]   something interesting happened.
[03:01:43.360 --> 03:01:44.560]   And this is what a kid will say.
[03:01:44.560 --> 03:01:47.320]   I'll go, "Oh, what, you love track again?"
[03:01:47.320 --> 03:01:49.520]   You know, and it's this amazing moment
[03:01:49.520 --> 03:01:52.360]   'cause they're always gonna say that to be like,
[03:01:52.360 --> 03:01:56.560]   no, no, I ended up deciding that next year
[03:01:56.560 --> 03:01:57.760]   was my last year at track.
[03:01:57.760 --> 03:02:00.720]   And I stopped after that, but can't explain it.
[03:02:00.720 --> 03:02:04.160]   It just, it felt like it came from like a different place.
[03:02:04.160 --> 03:02:06.160]   And almost like I felt more settled, I think after,
[03:02:06.160 --> 03:02:08.200]   like I really knew.
[03:02:08.200 --> 03:02:10.960]   And I don't know if that's relevant to gymnastics.
[03:02:10.960 --> 03:02:12.440]   I do know you've loved it for a while.
[03:02:12.440 --> 03:02:14.840]   It's kind of new to not like it.
[03:02:14.840 --> 03:02:17.320]   And sometimes when something's new and you don't like it,
[03:02:17.320 --> 03:02:18.840]   you just gotta go.
[03:02:18.840 --> 03:02:21.120]   But other times when something's new and you don't like it,
[03:02:21.120 --> 03:02:23.160]   you wanna like figure it out.
[03:02:23.160 --> 03:02:26.040]   And I don't know, I'm wondering if we should give it
[03:02:26.040 --> 03:02:28.600]   a few more weeks to try the figuring it out thing.
[03:02:28.600 --> 03:02:31.280]   And again, maybe your kid says,
[03:02:31.280 --> 03:02:32.120]   "No, I wanna quit."
[03:02:32.120 --> 03:02:33.600]   And you're like, "Fine."
[03:02:33.600 --> 03:02:35.480]   And in some ways you've already had the experience
[03:02:35.480 --> 03:02:37.360]   no matter what they do.
[03:02:37.360 --> 03:02:41.000]   But I think that's what I think about playing around with
[03:02:41.000 --> 03:02:44.520]   with kids way more than, I think what parents say is,
[03:02:44.520 --> 03:02:46.120]   "So should they quit or not?"
[03:02:46.120 --> 03:02:49.400]   It's so binary, it's so rigid.
[03:02:49.400 --> 03:02:52.000]   And I think we're missing the nuance of the story
[03:02:52.000 --> 03:02:53.920]   and the process that matters more
[03:02:53.920 --> 03:02:55.680]   than the eventual decision.
[03:02:55.680 --> 03:03:02.240]   - I love your use of story in narrative with your kids.
[03:03:02.240 --> 03:03:04.760]   It seems like you use that a lot.
[03:03:04.760 --> 03:03:05.600]   - I do.
[03:03:05.600 --> 03:03:08.680]   - Instead of saying, you know, and forgive me for,
[03:03:08.680 --> 03:03:11.040]   I'm not an analyst, but I feel like it starts
[03:03:11.040 --> 03:03:12.280]   with an observation.
[03:03:12.280 --> 03:03:14.040]   Like, okay, you're behaving this way,
[03:03:14.040 --> 03:03:16.280]   maybe what's behind the behavior or you're expressing this,
[03:03:16.280 --> 03:03:17.560]   what's maybe deeper to that.
[03:03:17.560 --> 03:03:20.960]   But when talking about your own experiences
[03:03:20.960 --> 03:03:22.800]   towards your kids as you've been doing here
[03:03:22.800 --> 03:03:24.280]   in these pseudo hypotheticals,
[03:03:24.280 --> 03:03:25.120]   I'm sure some of them is,
[03:03:25.120 --> 03:03:26.920]   this we'll interview your kids later and find out.
[03:03:26.920 --> 03:03:27.760]   No, I'm kidding.
[03:03:27.760 --> 03:03:32.200]   It's clear that you use story as a way
[03:03:32.200 --> 03:03:34.960]   to kind of share genuinely,
[03:03:34.960 --> 03:03:38.200]   but also probe for what might be going on with them.
[03:03:38.200 --> 03:03:42.480]   And I have to say, I find it really delightful
[03:03:42.480 --> 03:03:47.400]   because it raises lots of questions
[03:03:47.400 --> 03:03:49.880]   that I think anyone would have.
[03:03:49.880 --> 03:03:53.600]   And I think it's part of your gift, clearly,
[03:03:53.600 --> 03:03:58.600]   because so many people follow your advice.
[03:03:58.600 --> 03:04:01.000]   But the advice you give is also, it's interesting,
[03:04:01.000 --> 03:04:03.320]   it's like an observation, like frustration is key.
[03:04:03.320 --> 03:04:05.480]   I want to increase frustration tolerance,
[03:04:05.480 --> 03:04:07.480]   but then you're not like, okay,
[03:04:07.480 --> 03:04:09.640]   you're going to hammer down their throats,
[03:04:09.640 --> 03:04:11.400]   frustration tolerance in the following way.
[03:04:11.400 --> 03:04:12.800]   It sort of becomes a question,
[03:04:12.800 --> 03:04:14.680]   like where's their frustration in your life?
[03:04:14.680 --> 03:04:17.680]   And then you put it into your own narrative
[03:04:17.680 --> 03:04:20.680]   as opposed to necessarily asking them questions.
[03:04:20.680 --> 03:04:21.920]   I think asking kids questions
[03:04:21.920 --> 03:04:23.680]   or asking people questions generally is great.
[03:04:23.680 --> 03:04:24.880]   Like, hey, how can I do better?
[03:04:24.880 --> 03:04:26.240]   As you pointed out earlier.
[03:04:26.240 --> 03:04:29.640]   But it's really, I don't know if the word is disarming,
[03:04:29.640 --> 03:04:34.440]   but it's really in an entirely positive way,
[03:04:34.440 --> 03:04:36.280]   the way like you use your own narrative
[03:04:36.280 --> 03:04:37.920]   to allow people to start going,
[03:04:37.920 --> 03:04:40.040]   oh yeah, like, where am I experiencing frustration?
[03:04:40.040 --> 03:04:41.880]   Where can I tolerate that better?
[03:04:41.880 --> 03:04:45.880]   And so I think that there's this incredible triad of like,
[03:04:45.880 --> 03:04:50.360]   or tripartite thing of like observe,
[03:04:50.360 --> 03:04:53.280]   consider like the deeper layer,
[03:04:53.280 --> 03:04:54.760]   and then offering a narrative
[03:04:54.760 --> 03:04:56.560]   that's really a bunch of questions
[03:04:56.560 --> 03:05:00.320]   where you're speaking from your real truth.
[03:05:00.320 --> 03:05:03.440]   It's really elegant, I have to say, it's spectacular.
[03:05:03.440 --> 03:05:04.880]   I hadn't realized it until right now.
[03:05:04.880 --> 03:05:06.360]   I don't know if I realized those parts,
[03:05:06.360 --> 03:05:08.520]   but you know what is interesting
[03:05:08.520 --> 03:05:10.720]   is it brings up the word we kind of mentioned before,
[03:05:10.720 --> 03:05:11.800]   but didn't talk about,
[03:05:11.800 --> 03:05:14.880]   and maybe it'll be surprising that I say this, is shame.
[03:05:14.880 --> 03:05:19.880]   And I think shame is the biggest blocker to learning.
[03:05:19.880 --> 03:05:21.960]   And shame, I think, can be defined
[03:05:21.960 --> 03:05:24.080]   like a lot of things in many ways,
[03:05:24.080 --> 03:05:26.240]   but it's the experience of aloneness.
[03:05:26.240 --> 03:05:28.280]   I think shame is the feeling you have
[03:05:28.280 --> 03:05:31.040]   when you kind of feel like a part of you is not attachable.
[03:05:31.040 --> 03:05:33.720]   So for a kid, that's an existential threat
[03:05:33.720 --> 03:05:36.320]   to not be in attachment with someone.
[03:05:36.320 --> 03:05:38.960]   And in that way, when you're not attachable, you're alone.
[03:05:38.960 --> 03:05:40.640]   You're alone.
[03:05:40.640 --> 03:05:42.760]   And so, so many of the things that happen with our kids,
[03:05:42.760 --> 03:05:44.480]   'cause I'll model another story,
[03:05:44.480 --> 03:05:47.120]   and maybe I'll get some flack for this,
[03:05:47.120 --> 03:05:49.760]   because it's probably counterintuitive.
[03:05:49.760 --> 03:05:52.400]   But I think about like one of my kids,
[03:05:52.400 --> 03:05:53.920]   my resilient rebel,
[03:05:53.920 --> 03:05:56.320]   who was in a hitting stage when he was younger.
[03:05:56.320 --> 03:05:59.600]   Hitting, and he was in like a couple of weeks.
[03:05:59.600 --> 03:06:03.640]   He was hitting, and then there was this one,
[03:06:03.640 --> 03:06:06.000]   there was this one time where we were doing a family puzzle,
[03:06:06.000 --> 03:06:06.960]   and he was younger.
[03:06:06.960 --> 03:06:08.400]   He was probably like three.
[03:06:08.400 --> 03:06:09.480]   It was really hard.
[03:06:09.480 --> 03:06:11.160]   It was more for my older kids.
[03:06:11.160 --> 03:06:12.320]   He was kind of doing his own thing.
[03:06:12.320 --> 03:06:13.760]   I think he was playing with blocks on the side.
[03:06:13.760 --> 03:06:14.760]   We leave, we come back,
[03:06:14.760 --> 03:06:17.280]   and like a couple of the puzzle pieces
[03:06:17.280 --> 03:06:18.720]   were missing that we're in.
[03:06:18.720 --> 03:06:21.640]   And I just knew, I knew it.
[03:06:21.640 --> 03:06:22.920]   He saw it.
[03:06:22.920 --> 03:06:24.480]   I know most generous interpretation.
[03:06:24.480 --> 03:06:27.880]   He felt like, "Oh my God, I can't participate
[03:06:27.880 --> 03:06:29.760]   "in what the rest of the family is doing.
[03:06:29.760 --> 03:06:30.840]   "And so you know what I'm gonna do?
[03:06:30.840 --> 03:06:31.680]   "'Cause I'm a smart kid.
[03:06:31.680 --> 03:06:34.200]   "I'm just gonna stop them from participating.
[03:06:34.200 --> 03:06:37.600]   "And so I'm gonna take the puzzle pieces and hide them."
[03:06:37.600 --> 03:06:38.440]   I just, I knew it.
[03:06:38.440 --> 03:06:39.280]   I know him.
[03:06:39.280 --> 03:06:42.080]   So we come back and we worked really hard on this puzzle.
[03:06:42.080 --> 03:06:43.720]   Of course you're angry, but again,
[03:06:43.720 --> 03:06:45.600]   I can either do nothing on the outside
[03:06:45.600 --> 03:06:47.080]   or do nothing on the inside.
[03:06:47.080 --> 03:06:50.440]   In that moment, not always, but chose to be an adult.
[03:06:50.440 --> 03:06:52.440]   And I was just like, "I know you took the puzzle pieces.
[03:06:52.440 --> 03:06:53.400]   "I just want you to know."
[03:06:53.400 --> 03:06:54.240]   And he's like, "What are you talking?"
[03:06:54.240 --> 03:06:55.080]   "No, I didn't."
[03:06:55.080 --> 03:06:55.900]   You know, maybe he's four.
[03:06:55.900 --> 03:06:56.740]   "No, I didn't."
[03:06:56.740 --> 03:06:58.920]   And I was like, "We're working on this puzzle.
[03:06:58.920 --> 03:07:01.480]   "I get that it's probably frustrating,
[03:07:01.480 --> 03:07:02.880]   "but like, you need...
[03:07:02.880 --> 03:07:03.720]   "I'm not...
[03:07:03.720 --> 03:07:05.280]   "I didn't have the puzzle pieces."
[03:07:05.280 --> 03:07:06.380]   That was not working.
[03:07:06.380 --> 03:07:09.640]   And then this is truly going back to stories
[03:07:09.640 --> 03:07:11.520]   and going back to shame.
[03:07:11.520 --> 03:07:15.960]   If you feel like you're the bad kid who's doing bad things,
[03:07:15.960 --> 03:07:19.600]   and you're the only one who's like that,
[03:07:19.600 --> 03:07:22.440]   you are shut down from learning.
[03:07:22.440 --> 03:07:25.240]   So I went up to him on the couch
[03:07:25.240 --> 03:07:26.860]   and my husband, I remember watching me being like,
[03:07:26.860 --> 03:07:28.560]   "What are you doing?"
[03:07:28.560 --> 03:07:29.400]   And this is how I started.
[03:07:29.400 --> 03:07:32.880]   I go, "I don't know if I can tell you this."
[03:07:32.880 --> 03:07:34.380]   Which any kid's like,
[03:07:34.380 --> 03:07:36.280]   "I don't know if I can tell you this.
[03:07:36.280 --> 03:07:41.540]   "When I was probably about seven,
[03:07:41.540 --> 03:07:44.840]   "I did something really bad."
[03:07:44.840 --> 03:07:45.680]   That's what I said.
[03:07:45.680 --> 03:07:47.040]   And he was like, "I can't even tell you."
[03:07:47.040 --> 03:07:48.120]   He was like...
[03:07:48.120 --> 03:07:51.120]   He like, every part of his anger, like, diffused.
[03:07:51.120 --> 03:07:54.980]   And you can really draw a kid in by just saying to them,
[03:07:54.980 --> 03:07:55.800]   "I can't tell you.
[03:07:55.800 --> 03:07:56.640]   "I've never told anyone."
[03:07:56.640 --> 03:07:57.480]   And I go, "Okay."
[03:07:57.480 --> 03:07:59.040]   And this is true.
[03:07:59.040 --> 03:08:02.280]   I go, "My sister was two,
[03:08:02.280 --> 03:08:05.280]   "and she had these like oily stickers,
[03:08:05.280 --> 03:08:07.320]   "and I really wanted them.
[03:08:07.320 --> 03:08:08.440]   "And I asked my mom,
[03:08:08.440 --> 03:08:11.000]   "and she said, 'No, we couldn't go to the store.
[03:08:11.000 --> 03:08:14.200]   "'No, those are, you know, my sister's stickers.'
[03:08:14.200 --> 03:08:17.500]   "And you're never gonna guess what I did."
[03:08:17.500 --> 03:08:22.180]   And he was like, "I don't know.
[03:08:22.180 --> 03:08:23.340]   "You asked her for them.
[03:08:23.340 --> 03:08:24.400]   "You waited."
[03:08:24.400 --> 03:08:25.240]   You know?
[03:08:25.240 --> 03:08:28.320]   And I was like, "No, I took them."
[03:08:29.320 --> 03:08:31.760]   "But that's not the worst part."
[03:08:31.760 --> 03:08:33.520]   He's like, "What?"
[03:08:33.520 --> 03:08:36.640]   And I go, "My mom asked me if I took them.
[03:08:36.640 --> 03:08:40.520]   "I knew I did, so you know what I told her."
[03:08:40.520 --> 03:08:41.960]   And he said, "You told her yes?"
[03:08:41.960 --> 03:08:43.580]   And I go, "No.
[03:08:43.580 --> 03:08:45.820]   "I told her no."
[03:08:45.820 --> 03:08:49.920]   And he literally goes.
[03:08:49.920 --> 03:08:54.500]   - And I feel like in that moment,
[03:08:54.500 --> 03:08:57.560]   what's happening is he's saying like so many things
[03:08:57.560 --> 03:08:59.240]   that you can never say didactically.
[03:08:59.240 --> 03:09:01.280]   Like, "Mom, like, you're my mom.
[03:09:01.280 --> 03:09:02.200]   "I love you.
[03:09:02.200 --> 03:09:04.080]   "I hold you on a pedestal."
[03:09:04.080 --> 03:09:09.080]   And like, "Even you did something that wasn't so great."
[03:09:09.080 --> 03:09:12.600]   There's like so much hope and goodness.
[03:09:12.600 --> 03:09:14.680]   And then I didn't, in that moment,
[03:09:14.680 --> 03:09:17.520]   I did not say, and you cannot say in these situations,
[03:09:17.520 --> 03:09:19.200]   "So now you can tell me that."
[03:09:19.200 --> 03:09:20.980]   You just have to like trust.
[03:09:20.980 --> 03:09:25.840]   Because I think the shame of the badness,
[03:09:25.840 --> 03:09:28.800]   shame freezes you, right, as an animal defense state,
[03:09:28.800 --> 03:09:30.080]   right, shame freezes you.
[03:09:30.080 --> 03:09:34.720]   So a kid who's lying to you is always in shame.
[03:09:34.720 --> 03:09:38.320]   And you can't get a kid to unfreeze
[03:09:38.320 --> 03:09:41.240]   and move to a different place of telling you the truth
[03:09:41.240 --> 03:09:43.600]   if you're adding more shame through fear.
[03:09:43.600 --> 03:09:45.600]   Like, the math doesn't work.
[03:09:45.600 --> 03:09:47.140]   But you can through stories.
[03:09:47.140 --> 03:09:52.140]   Now, true story, he did not right after that say, you know.
[03:09:53.640 --> 03:09:56.440]   I was just like, I remember my husband who,
[03:09:56.440 --> 03:09:57.880]   okay, I won't be saying this.
[03:09:57.880 --> 03:09:58.900]   He was like, "We have to punish him.
[03:09:58.900 --> 03:10:00.480]   "We have to, you know, we have to punish him."
[03:10:00.480 --> 03:10:01.480]   I was like, "In the moment,
[03:10:01.480 --> 03:10:02.920]   "that's gonna feel very cathartic to us.
[03:10:02.920 --> 03:10:03.840]   "That's what punishment does.
[03:10:03.840 --> 03:10:05.320]   "It makes you feel very powerful.
[03:10:05.320 --> 03:10:07.240]   "It makes you feel very cathartic.
[03:10:07.240 --> 03:10:08.460]   "It doesn't work.
[03:10:08.460 --> 03:10:09.300]   "It just doesn't,
[03:10:09.300 --> 03:10:11.880]   "especially not with kids who are strong-willed."
[03:10:11.880 --> 03:10:13.920]   I was like, "Just give it a couple days."
[03:10:13.920 --> 03:10:17.600]   It was probably a good three days later.
[03:10:17.600 --> 03:10:20.480]   And he brought me the puzzle pieces in a bag.
[03:10:21.920 --> 03:10:24.820]   And he just said, "I took them."
[03:10:24.820 --> 03:10:27.720]   And he truly started crying.
[03:10:27.720 --> 03:10:30.960]   And I did not lecture him.
[03:10:30.960 --> 03:10:32.720]   I feel like the whole arc,
[03:10:32.720 --> 03:10:36.800]   the whole lesson had basically already happened.
[03:10:36.800 --> 03:10:38.960]   Honestly, like the day after or so,
[03:10:38.960 --> 03:10:40.680]   again, and this is what I think we miss as parents.
[03:10:40.680 --> 03:10:42.460]   And like, we're almost afraid
[03:10:42.460 --> 03:10:44.440]   to like just name the humanness of it.
[03:10:44.440 --> 03:10:46.560]   And I kind of gave an example earlier.
[03:10:46.560 --> 03:10:48.160]   He's gonna wanna do something bad again.
[03:10:48.160 --> 03:10:50.640]   We all want to do bad things.
[03:10:50.640 --> 03:10:51.720]   That's not a bad urge.
[03:10:51.720 --> 03:10:53.480]   It's just about having the skills
[03:10:53.480 --> 03:10:55.320]   to do something differently when you have the urge.
[03:10:55.320 --> 03:10:57.740]   So I think a couple of days later, and I do this.
[03:10:57.740 --> 03:10:59.040]   I do these little like role-plays.
[03:10:59.040 --> 03:11:00.280]   They take like 20 seconds.
[03:11:00.280 --> 03:11:01.680]   I was like, "Oh my goodness.
[03:11:01.680 --> 03:11:03.880]   "Look at the puzzle."
[03:11:03.880 --> 03:11:05.200]   'Cause we'd still been working on it.
[03:11:05.200 --> 03:11:06.440]   "What if you wanna take it again?"
[03:11:06.440 --> 03:11:07.280]   He goes, "I won't."
[03:11:07.280 --> 03:11:09.720]   I go, "I know, but I think you might want to.
[03:11:09.720 --> 03:11:12.920]   "Remember how I took the oilies."
[03:11:12.920 --> 03:11:14.680]   - So you're acknowledging that inside him,
[03:11:14.680 --> 03:11:15.520]   there might be a piece
[03:11:15.520 --> 03:11:17.560]   that still wants to do the wrong thing.
[03:11:17.560 --> 03:11:19.240]   - Feelings, and that's an urge.
[03:11:19.240 --> 03:11:20.080]   I teach my kids.
[03:11:20.080 --> 03:11:21.760]   An urge means you want to do something.
[03:11:21.760 --> 03:11:23.800]   My kids will say, "An urge is not a behavior.
[03:11:23.800 --> 03:11:25.480]   "Behavior is doing the thing."
[03:11:25.480 --> 03:11:26.720]   That's not okay.
[03:11:26.720 --> 03:11:29.600]   But the only reason your urge doesn't convert into behavior
[03:11:29.600 --> 03:11:31.880]   is 'cause you have a skill to manage the urge.
[03:11:31.880 --> 03:11:34.880]   And you can't build skills if no one teaches you them.
[03:11:34.880 --> 03:11:37.320]   So I said, "What could you do instead?
[03:11:37.320 --> 03:11:38.400]   "Could you run to me and say,
[03:11:38.400 --> 03:11:40.100]   "'I really wanna take the pieces.'
[03:11:40.100 --> 03:11:41.560]   "Could you say, 'I need time with you.'"
[03:11:41.560 --> 03:11:43.880]   Because at the end of the day, I think he felt left out.
[03:11:43.880 --> 03:11:44.720]   And we did.
[03:11:44.720 --> 03:11:46.440]   And by the way, this kid, is he like perfect now?
[03:11:46.440 --> 03:11:47.400]   No, he, you know.
[03:11:47.400 --> 03:11:52.400]   But like, it brings together so many things.
[03:11:52.400 --> 03:11:57.040]   When number one, when we trust ourself that we have time,
[03:11:57.040 --> 03:12:00.200]   when we realize shame, the fear of being the only one,
[03:12:00.200 --> 03:12:02.360]   being bad, being unlovable, being alone,
[03:12:02.360 --> 03:12:04.780]   is often the biggest blocker for kids.
[03:12:04.780 --> 03:12:06.440]   When you really realize that,
[03:12:06.440 --> 03:12:11.440]   punishment and sending your kid away makes no sense at all.
[03:12:11.440 --> 03:12:16.220]   And you can kind of give yourself freedom to tell stories.
[03:12:16.220 --> 03:12:19.360]   Right, because when we're really struggling with something,
[03:12:19.360 --> 03:12:20.760]   you don't wanna look at someone,
[03:12:20.760 --> 03:12:23.120]   especially someone who's perfect, right?
[03:12:23.120 --> 03:12:25.680]   It's like when you really have a bad experience as an adult,
[03:12:25.680 --> 03:12:27.480]   the only thing you wanna hear is your friend who had,
[03:12:27.480 --> 03:12:29.780]   like, you know, "I'm mortified.
[03:12:29.780 --> 03:12:32.400]   "I sent this email to my boss.
[03:12:32.400 --> 03:12:34.140]   "The only thing that would make me feel better
[03:12:34.140 --> 03:12:36.520]   "is someone like, 'Let me show you the email I sent.'"
[03:12:36.520 --> 03:12:37.920]   I'm like, "Oh, wow, that's worse."
[03:12:37.920 --> 03:12:39.360]   That's the only thing that makes you feel better.
[03:12:39.360 --> 03:12:41.080]   Not because I wish bad upon other people,
[03:12:41.080 --> 03:12:43.680]   but because you wanna know you're not alone.
[03:12:43.680 --> 03:12:46.980]   And other people's stories do that, like vulnerability.
[03:12:46.980 --> 03:12:52.620]   It's kind of like, it's like this magic trick.
[03:12:52.620 --> 03:12:56.060]   - I mean, is pretty far away from the parenting dynamic,
[03:12:56.060 --> 03:13:00.700]   but the understanding and actual data
[03:13:00.700 --> 03:13:04.620]   from, like, 12-step programs and group therapy generally,
[03:13:04.620 --> 03:13:09.300]   including trauma therapy that is of a group therapy nature,
[03:13:09.300 --> 03:13:12.100]   fully supports everything you said.
[03:13:12.100 --> 03:13:17.020]   Hearing the terrible and/or humiliating things
[03:13:17.020 --> 03:13:19.020]   that people have done or have done to them,
[03:13:19.020 --> 03:13:20.380]   as awful as that sounds, you know,
[03:13:20.380 --> 03:13:24.020]   is often what underlies people's willingness to recover,
[03:13:24.020 --> 03:13:27.500]   ability to recover, and then they become the teachers
[03:13:27.500 --> 03:13:28.340]   over time. - That's right.
[03:13:28.340 --> 03:13:29.820]   - Like you said, I think you said
[03:13:29.820 --> 03:13:31.380]   so many incredible things there,
[03:13:31.380 --> 03:13:33.380]   but right at the end, you said something
[03:13:33.380 --> 03:13:35.180]   that I hope everyone internalizes,
[03:13:35.180 --> 03:13:37.580]   that when you do something embarrassing,
[03:13:37.580 --> 03:13:41.260]   maybe even humiliating, the last thing you wanna hear
[03:13:41.260 --> 03:13:43.520]   is, "Look, it's all gonna be fine."
[03:13:43.520 --> 03:13:45.320]   The thing that actually helps is somebody
[03:13:45.320 --> 03:13:49.740]   who has experienced something similar and is doing fine.
[03:13:49.740 --> 03:13:51.460]   - Yeah, and I use that at management.
[03:13:51.460 --> 03:13:53.700]   Like, we had someone do a presentation at work,
[03:13:53.700 --> 03:13:56.620]   and it was for a bunch of people, and it did not go well.
[03:13:56.620 --> 03:13:59.040]   And I met with her, and she knew it kinda didn't go well.
[03:13:59.040 --> 03:14:00.500]   And honestly, the only thing I said to her,
[03:14:00.500 --> 03:14:03.060]   I don't even manage her directly, she's more junior.
[03:14:03.060 --> 03:14:04.560]   And I really mean this, we had,
[03:14:04.560 --> 03:14:06.900]   in clinical psychology grad school, it gets intense.
[03:14:06.900 --> 03:14:09.620]   You do a session when you're first doing sessions,
[03:14:09.620 --> 03:14:11.500]   and everyone's watching you.
[03:14:11.500 --> 03:14:14.420]   They're watching you do therapy, which is helpful.
[03:14:14.420 --> 03:14:16.420]   But I remember my first one,
[03:14:16.420 --> 03:14:18.080]   and I felt pretty okay about it.
[03:14:18.080 --> 03:14:19.860]   I was like, "This is my first one, I was okay."
[03:14:19.860 --> 03:14:22.460]   I got torn to shreds.
[03:14:22.460 --> 03:14:24.900]   They were like, "That was not good."
[03:14:24.900 --> 03:14:29.380]   And now, obviously, I feel good about my clinical abilities,
[03:14:29.380 --> 03:14:32.380]   but the only thing I said to her is I was like,
[03:14:32.380 --> 03:14:34.460]   "Look," and I shared it with her.
[03:14:34.460 --> 03:14:37.100]   And I said, "I've been there."
[03:14:38.460 --> 03:14:42.260]   Eventually, I look back on that, it helped me learn.
[03:14:42.260 --> 03:14:43.860]   That day, I just felt awful.
[03:14:43.860 --> 03:14:46.620]   I wasn't like, "This is my learning space moment."
[03:14:46.620 --> 03:14:47.820]   And so, if you're feeling like that,
[03:14:47.820 --> 03:14:50.900]   I just wanna let you know, I've been there, too.
[03:14:50.900 --> 03:14:53.020]   This is the starting point to getting better.
[03:14:53.020 --> 03:14:54.540]   This is gonna make you stronger.
[03:14:54.540 --> 03:14:56.380]   I know that I've lived that.
[03:14:56.380 --> 03:14:58.900]   And I think storytelling in that way
[03:14:58.900 --> 03:15:02.140]   is probably a really underutilized quote tool,
[03:15:02.140 --> 03:15:04.540]   almost dehumanizes it to call it that,
[03:15:04.540 --> 03:15:06.760]   in management, in any relationship.
[03:15:08.060 --> 03:15:11.020]   - Love it, and I feel like the story of your son
[03:15:11.020 --> 03:15:13.300]   bringing those puzzle pieces back is like,
[03:15:13.300 --> 03:15:15.580]   there's so much there.
[03:15:15.580 --> 03:15:16.420]   - So much.
[03:15:16.420 --> 03:15:17.860]   - And the fact that there was a delay,
[03:15:17.860 --> 03:15:20.980]   and then he brought it back on his own accord,
[03:15:20.980 --> 03:15:24.060]   and that you had already kinda let it go,
[03:15:24.060 --> 03:15:26.380]   that's, I feel like, a really interesting piece.
[03:15:26.380 --> 03:15:28.660]   It wasn't to appease you,
[03:15:28.660 --> 03:15:30.420]   it was really something internal for him.
[03:15:30.420 --> 03:15:33.940]   He got the lesson for him.
[03:15:33.940 --> 03:15:37.300]   It wasn't just about making mom feel okay about him.
[03:15:37.300 --> 03:15:38.860]   He clearly understood you still love him,
[03:15:38.860 --> 03:15:42.340]   but it wasn't about fixing something externally
[03:15:42.340 --> 03:15:44.340]   as much as it was about fixing something internally,
[03:15:44.340 --> 03:15:46.840]   which I think is the addressing
[03:15:46.840 --> 03:15:48.440]   and overcoming the shame piece.
[03:15:48.440 --> 03:15:50.300]   - I think that's right, and that's the thing,
[03:15:50.300 --> 03:15:52.140]   I think sometimes, it's like,
[03:15:52.140 --> 03:15:55.660]   are we teaching kids what to think or how to think?
[03:15:55.660 --> 03:15:59.160]   After they're gone from our house, it's the how to think.
[03:15:59.160 --> 03:16:00.980]   And you said questions.
[03:16:00.980 --> 03:16:04.260]   I love kind of Socratic questions for kids.
[03:16:04.260 --> 03:16:06.960]   Like, oh, if, again, a different version of a story
[03:16:06.960 --> 03:16:08.980]   would be like, oh, okay,
[03:16:08.980 --> 03:16:10.580]   I know you didn't take the puzzle pieces,
[03:16:10.580 --> 03:16:11.520]   but I'm just thinking for me,
[03:16:11.520 --> 03:16:15.740]   like, what would make me take puzzle pieces?
[03:16:15.740 --> 03:16:17.980]   Oh, I wonder if I felt left out,
[03:16:17.980 --> 03:16:20.100]   or I wonder if I was just really trying
[03:16:20.100 --> 03:16:21.460]   to get my parents' attention for a while,
[03:16:21.460 --> 03:16:22.620]   and this was the only way to do it,
[03:16:22.620 --> 03:16:26.620]   and what would I do after, and what would I need,
[03:16:26.620 --> 03:16:28.500]   now I'm gonna get emotional,
[03:16:28.500 --> 03:16:32.100]   what would I need to know about myself or from my parent
[03:16:32.100 --> 03:16:35.020]   for me to share that I did take it?
[03:16:36.260 --> 03:16:37.240]   Maybe I would need to know
[03:16:37.240 --> 03:16:40.780]   that my parents knew I was a good kid.
[03:16:40.780 --> 03:16:42.440]   Anyway, sorry, what were we talking about?
[03:16:42.440 --> 03:16:46.600]   Like, 'cause your kids eventually make good decisions.
[03:16:46.600 --> 03:16:48.520]   Adults make good decisions for themselves
[03:16:48.520 --> 03:16:50.920]   because they ask themselves the right questions.
[03:16:50.920 --> 03:16:54.200]   And not because they've heard their parents'
[03:16:54.200 --> 03:16:56.000]   specific lesson, right?
[03:16:56.000 --> 03:16:57.480]   Because they're able to say to themselves,
[03:16:57.480 --> 03:16:58.800]   like, what am I feeling right now?
[03:16:58.800 --> 03:16:59.840]   What am I really looking for?
[03:16:59.840 --> 03:17:01.040]   Why did I do that?
[03:17:01.040 --> 03:17:03.160]   So, like, asking questions, telling stories,
[03:17:03.160 --> 03:17:05.880]   asking questions without even answering them
[03:17:05.880 --> 03:17:08.580]   actually provokes a much more sophisticated
[03:17:08.580 --> 03:17:10.940]   developmental process in your kid
[03:17:10.940 --> 03:17:14.460]   than the lectures we all, me included.
[03:17:14.460 --> 03:17:15.860]   Trust me, plenty of times at my kid
[03:17:15.860 --> 03:17:17.420]   that I've just lectured them.
[03:17:17.420 --> 03:17:18.660]   But again, they're just catharsis.
[03:17:18.660 --> 03:17:21.420]   They're not actually terribly effective.
[03:17:21.420 --> 03:17:24.980]   - Yeah, if ever there was some core truths
[03:17:24.980 --> 03:17:28.820]   about brain plasticity, it's that frustration
[03:17:28.820 --> 03:17:32.660]   is associated with the chemicals that foster brain change.
[03:17:32.660 --> 03:17:33.500]   We know that.
[03:17:33.680 --> 03:17:37.240]   And that questions have a really interesting impact
[03:17:37.240 --> 03:17:39.680]   on learning, which sounds kind of like a duh.
[03:17:39.680 --> 03:17:40.520]   Well, of course they do.
[03:17:40.520 --> 03:17:41.480]   But when we ask questions,
[03:17:41.480 --> 03:17:42.920]   it creates this open loop in the brain
[03:17:42.920 --> 03:17:44.520]   that the brain wants to solve,
[03:17:44.520 --> 03:17:46.400]   as opposed to hearing a statement.
[03:17:46.400 --> 03:17:49.120]   This is why I always felt like those pictures
[03:17:49.120 --> 03:17:52.360]   on office walls, like motivation, when you blah, blah, blah.
[03:17:52.360 --> 03:17:56.080]   Like, motivational statements don't mean much
[03:17:56.080 --> 03:17:59.320]   in terms of, because they're not about verb states.
[03:17:59.320 --> 03:18:01.040]   When we ask questions, we put our brain
[03:18:01.040 --> 03:18:03.280]   into kind of a process of verb states,
[03:18:03.280 --> 03:18:06.140]   of asking what behaviors are gonna lead to which outcomes.
[03:18:06.140 --> 03:18:08.020]   There's an interesting literature about this
[03:18:08.020 --> 03:18:10.180]   that probably isn't fully relevant here,
[03:18:10.180 --> 03:18:12.820]   but it gets back to trying to learn basic motor tasks.
[03:18:12.820 --> 03:18:15.060]   And the same things are applied to basic cognitive tasks
[03:18:15.060 --> 03:18:16.540]   of like, how do I solve this?
[03:18:16.540 --> 03:18:19.480]   And a puzzle is a great example
[03:18:19.480 --> 03:18:21.460]   because it's both cognitive and motor.
[03:18:21.460 --> 03:18:23.900]   Like you're fixing these pieces in different ways.
[03:18:23.900 --> 03:18:26.260]   I have to get back to doing some puzzles, I'm realizing.
[03:18:26.260 --> 03:18:27.460]   - And emotional.
[03:18:27.460 --> 03:18:28.940]   You know, I can really embarrass myself,
[03:18:28.940 --> 03:18:30.680]   but one of my favorite things that I, again,
[03:18:30.680 --> 03:18:33.240]   I've just noticed my kids extending for puzzles,
[03:18:33.240 --> 03:18:34.780]   'cause they all did a lot of puzzles when they're young,
[03:18:34.780 --> 03:18:37.860]   is, it's so funny, I remember my kid doing like this puzzle
[03:18:37.860 --> 03:18:39.820]   and getting some frustration.
[03:18:39.820 --> 03:18:42.880]   What I did is I did a puzzle to the side of him.
[03:18:42.880 --> 03:18:46.380]   And instead of doing it perfectly, I kind of like mimicked.
[03:18:46.380 --> 03:18:48.260]   I was like, oh, this doesn't fit.
[03:18:48.260 --> 03:18:50.300]   Oh, it's not that piece, okay?
[03:18:50.300 --> 03:18:51.220]   And one of the things I noticed,
[03:18:51.220 --> 03:18:52.620]   this is when my kid was really young,
[03:18:52.620 --> 03:18:55.620]   is kids have a really hard time with puzzles,
[03:18:55.620 --> 03:18:57.500]   and it's kind of a metaphor for life,
[03:18:57.500 --> 03:19:01.500]   for when a piece doesn't fit, they keep trying it.
[03:19:01.500 --> 03:19:03.960]   When what they really need to do, it's such a metaphor,
[03:19:03.960 --> 03:19:08.960]   is put it down and pick up another piece, right?
[03:19:08.960 --> 03:19:10.720]   But I could tell my kid that, but I'm not,
[03:19:10.720 --> 03:19:12.320]   I always feel like just telling doesn't really work.
[03:19:12.320 --> 03:19:14.640]   So this is what I did, I'm not joking.
[03:19:14.640 --> 03:19:16.480]   I'm gonna sing, get ready, okay?
[03:19:16.480 --> 03:19:18.360]   So I was doing it over here, and I just go,
[03:19:18.360 --> 03:19:19.800]   oh, it's not fitting, it's not fitting here,
[03:19:19.800 --> 03:19:20.960]   it's not fitting here.
[03:19:20.960 --> 03:19:25.640]   And I go, ♪ If it doesn't fit ♪
[03:19:25.640 --> 03:19:30.640]   ♪ Put it to the side and try another piece ♪
[03:19:31.580 --> 03:19:36.220]   And then I was like, oh, right, I can put it to the side.
[03:19:36.220 --> 03:19:37.940]   Okay, I'll get this one, and I didn't make it perfect,
[03:19:37.940 --> 03:19:42.940]   I was like, oh, oh, oh, that one fits there, right?
[03:19:42.940 --> 03:19:47.900]   I have heard, not anymore, my kids are too old,
[03:19:47.900 --> 03:19:49.700]   but there was a time, I remember me and my husband
[03:19:49.700 --> 03:19:50.660]   were like outside the playroom,
[03:19:50.660 --> 03:19:55.460]   and we heard our son like singing this song.
[03:19:55.460 --> 03:19:58.900]   It's just, it's a mantra, it's self-regulation,
[03:19:58.900 --> 03:20:01.520]   because is it cognitive, is it physical?
[03:20:01.520 --> 03:20:04.800]   It's also emotional, it goes back to frustration tolerance,
[03:20:04.800 --> 03:20:07.360]   where our kids need, they need mantras, they need skills,
[03:20:07.360 --> 03:20:11.840]   they need songs to actually up-level their skills
[03:20:11.840 --> 03:20:15.520]   to regulate the emotions that get in their way
[03:20:15.520 --> 03:20:17.560]   of doing great things, right?
[03:20:17.560 --> 03:20:21.720]   And that kid is interesting, like not really anymore,
[03:20:21.720 --> 03:20:23.240]   now that I think about it, I wanna revive it.
[03:20:23.240 --> 03:20:26.280]   He makes up songs through situations,
[03:20:26.280 --> 03:20:28.680]   what an amazing skill, right?
[03:20:28.680 --> 03:20:31.820]   But the stuff can like, and if anyone's hearing this,
[03:20:31.820 --> 03:20:32.800]   they're like, oh, that's unrealistic,
[03:20:32.800 --> 03:20:36.000]   like it's amazing you do it one time, one time,
[03:20:36.000 --> 03:20:39.620]   make up a silly song, model the frustration yourself,
[03:20:39.620 --> 03:20:43.280]   make up a song, struggle again, and then get success,
[03:20:43.280 --> 03:20:45.360]   whatever it is, it could be with reading,
[03:20:45.360 --> 03:20:47.400]   with a puzzle, with putting on your sock,
[03:20:47.400 --> 03:20:50.600]   it could be, oh, it doesn't fit,
[03:20:50.600 --> 03:20:54.400]   I'm taking a deep breath and trying it again,
[03:20:54.400 --> 03:20:56.160]   it could literally be anything,
[03:20:56.160 --> 03:20:57.600]   'cause it adds a little play and joy,
[03:20:57.600 --> 03:20:59.000]   and you probably know what song does in the brain
[03:20:59.000 --> 03:21:01.300]   better than I do, but probably regulating.
[03:21:01.300 --> 03:21:05.280]   I would put money, a parent's gonna be like,
[03:21:05.280 --> 03:21:06.480]   that's so weird, Becky, you're right,
[03:21:06.480 --> 03:21:07.880]   didn't take that much time, I did it one time
[03:21:07.880 --> 03:21:09.560]   and my kids started singing the song
[03:21:09.560 --> 03:21:12.000]   and now they put their socks on by themselves.
[03:21:12.000 --> 03:21:14.320]   - I love it, you taught a process through song
[03:21:14.320 --> 03:21:17.920]   and there actually is a lot of data on music in the brain
[03:21:17.920 --> 03:21:20.560]   and how it organizes things, mostly in the form of a story
[03:21:20.560 --> 03:21:21.680]   of a beginning, middle, and end,
[03:21:21.680 --> 03:21:23.460]   and just the quickest example I can give
[03:21:23.460 --> 03:21:27.020]   is when we learn our ABCs, we learn them in song.
[03:21:27.780 --> 03:21:29.220]   - Right, it's A, B, C, D, E, F, G,
[03:21:29.220 --> 03:21:31.520]   you never forget that, right?
[03:21:31.520 --> 03:21:36.060]   It's much easier to learn things through rhythmic song,
[03:21:36.060 --> 03:21:39.740]   little motifs, than it is through a list
[03:21:39.740 --> 03:21:41.060]   of letters or numbers.
[03:21:41.060 --> 03:21:42.740]   - Does our brain encode it differently?
[03:21:42.740 --> 03:21:45.020]   - Yeah, so it fragments it into a beginning,
[03:21:45.020 --> 03:21:46.780]   middle, and end, and then there's an underlying
[03:21:46.780 --> 03:21:50.300]   repetitive sort of wave, A, B, C, D, E, F, G,
[03:21:50.300 --> 03:21:51.500]   okay, here I am now, I'm singing,
[03:21:51.500 --> 03:21:54.660]   so at risk of inducing-- - Embarrassing both of us.
[03:21:54.660 --> 03:21:58.620]   - Inducing all sorts of bad neural responses in listeners,
[03:21:58.620 --> 03:22:01.580]   but you get the point, it's a wave form
[03:22:01.580 --> 03:22:03.340]   that the brain can recognize.
[03:22:03.340 --> 03:22:05.980]   I actually have a friend who's a very accomplished musician
[03:22:05.980 --> 03:22:07.820]   and I know the lyrics to his songs very well,
[03:22:07.820 --> 03:22:09.260]   and I said, "Remember that song?"
[03:22:09.260 --> 03:22:11.860]   He goes, "Well, I have to hear the underlying melody,"
[03:22:11.860 --> 03:22:14.140]   and then he can remember all the words, he's a singer,
[03:22:14.140 --> 03:22:16.820]   he's a lead singer in a very well-known band,
[03:22:16.820 --> 03:22:18.340]   he doesn't even know the words to his own songs
[03:22:18.340 --> 03:22:21.260]   if you just ask them for 'em, but you give him the music
[03:22:21.260 --> 03:22:23.220]   and he's just out the gate, and he can do this
[03:22:23.220 --> 03:22:25.060]   in front of tens of thousands of people.
[03:22:25.060 --> 03:22:27.380]   - So then it is a cheat code for coping skills
[03:22:27.380 --> 03:22:28.460]   if you put it to song. - It is.
[03:22:28.460 --> 03:22:30.540]   It becomes a verb process.
[03:22:30.540 --> 03:22:31.700]   Sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off there.
[03:22:31.700 --> 03:22:32.540]   It's almost like saying like,
[03:22:32.540 --> 03:22:34.260]   oh, the mechanics of writing are you pick up,
[03:22:34.260 --> 03:22:39.060]   you put the pen between, there's a whole rhythm to writing,
[03:22:39.060 --> 03:22:41.380]   there's a whole sequence of, a motor sequence
[03:22:41.380 --> 03:22:44.300]   that we learn, or eating, or anything for that matter.
[03:22:44.300 --> 03:22:46.980]   No one who's an expert piano player
[03:22:46.980 --> 03:22:48.620]   thinks about playing the individual keys
[03:22:48.620 --> 03:22:49.980]   at the point where they've learned it,
[03:22:49.980 --> 03:22:52.860]   they've batched it into, it's sort of like chunking,
[03:22:52.860 --> 03:22:54.700]   but it has an underlying rhythm
[03:22:54.700 --> 03:22:56.420]   that's carried by a neural circuit
[03:22:56.420 --> 03:22:59.180]   that allows the expression of the movements of the fingers
[03:22:59.180 --> 03:23:01.220]   or the words out the mouth, or in this case,
[03:23:01.220 --> 03:23:03.060]   overcoming frustration to just kind of
[03:23:03.060 --> 03:23:04.900]   ride on top of all of it.
[03:23:04.900 --> 03:23:09.020]   So there's an unconscious genius to what you did,
[03:23:09.020 --> 03:23:12.500]   and I love it, and maybe as long as nobody hears me sing,
[03:23:12.500 --> 03:23:15.340]   I'll need to sing more to get through frustration.
[03:23:15.340 --> 03:23:22.140]   I have a question about Miss Edson.
[03:23:22.140 --> 03:23:22.980]   - Yes.
[03:23:22.980 --> 03:23:24.980]   - People are gonna be like, what?
[03:23:24.980 --> 03:23:27.780]   Before we started recording, you shared with us
[03:23:27.780 --> 03:23:29.300]   something I think is entirely appropriate
[03:23:29.300 --> 03:23:30.260]   to what we're talking about now,
[03:23:30.260 --> 03:23:33.260]   which is learning, and learning hard things,
[03:23:33.260 --> 03:23:35.100]   and frustration tolerance,
[03:23:35.100 --> 03:23:40.100]   and you've evolved these concepts in the course of your work
[03:23:40.100 --> 03:23:43.660]   and through your own parenting child relationships,
[03:23:43.660 --> 03:23:46.500]   clearly your own, and then yours with your kids.
[03:23:46.500 --> 03:23:48.220]   Who was Miss Edson, and what did she teach you?
[03:23:48.220 --> 03:23:50.060]   Because when you told me this, I was like,
[03:23:50.060 --> 03:23:53.420]   whoa, that's super valuable, we all need to know about this.
[03:23:53.420 --> 03:23:56.580]   - Yes, so Miss Edson was my second grade teacher,
[03:23:56.580 --> 03:24:00.220]   and I remember writing in her class,
[03:24:00.220 --> 03:24:02.780]   and I remember something she told us,
[03:24:02.780 --> 03:24:05.260]   and it's truly something that shapes me every day,
[03:24:05.260 --> 03:24:10.100]   and she said, "If something feels too hard to start,
[03:24:10.100 --> 03:24:14.980]   "it just means that the first step isn't small enough."
[03:24:14.980 --> 03:24:19.340]   And then she really kind of made this even more concrete,
[03:24:19.340 --> 03:24:22.100]   because what I remember in her class writing,
[03:24:22.100 --> 03:24:23.860]   and I still use this in writing today,
[03:24:23.860 --> 03:24:27.260]   is, okay, so if something feels too hard to do,
[03:24:27.260 --> 03:24:29.660]   the implication is, it doesn't mean it's my fault,
[03:24:29.660 --> 03:24:32.020]   it doesn't mean I can't, it doesn't mean I'm stupid,
[03:24:32.020 --> 03:24:34.940]   it literally just means the first step isn't small enough,
[03:24:34.940 --> 03:24:37.260]   that's very actionable.
[03:24:37.260 --> 03:24:41.020]   And so the way I play around with it now,
[03:24:41.020 --> 03:24:42.860]   even in my own writing, is,
[03:24:42.860 --> 03:24:44.420]   okay, I have to write a new article,
[03:24:44.420 --> 03:24:46.340]   and I'm like, I can't do that.
[03:24:46.340 --> 03:24:47.540]   Okay, so I'm in I can't mode.
[03:24:47.540 --> 03:24:49.700]   Okay, if something is, and I can't mode,
[03:24:49.700 --> 03:24:51.540]   if it feels too hard, I hear her voice,
[03:24:51.540 --> 03:24:53.340]   it just means the first step isn't small enough,
[03:24:53.340 --> 03:24:56.100]   so I'll make it, literally, I'll just make it smaller.
[03:24:56.100 --> 03:24:57.380]   I'm gonna write a page today,
[03:24:57.380 --> 03:24:59.300]   and then often I'm like, I can't do that.
[03:24:59.300 --> 03:25:02.620]   Okay, smaller, a paragraph, no.
[03:25:02.620 --> 03:25:05.460]   And I literally do it until, and some days it's a word,
[03:25:05.460 --> 03:25:09.540]   and I go, you know what, I can write a word.
[03:25:09.540 --> 03:25:12.380]   Okay, now I'm not, okay, right?
[03:25:12.380 --> 03:25:16.380]   And I really think Ms. Edson was ahead of her time.
[03:25:16.380 --> 03:25:17.460]   I mean, obviously now we talk a lot
[03:25:17.460 --> 03:25:19.940]   about frustration tolerance, growth mindset,
[03:25:19.940 --> 03:25:23.500]   but this really is a way of saying,
[03:25:23.500 --> 03:25:25.980]   when things are hard, it's not your fault,
[03:25:25.980 --> 03:25:27.860]   and there's something you can do
[03:25:27.860 --> 03:25:30.220]   to build the circuit of capability.
[03:25:30.220 --> 03:25:32.740]   Because I think when we're trying to do something hard,
[03:25:32.740 --> 03:25:34.020]   there are, like if you think about it,
[03:25:34.020 --> 03:25:36.820]   I don't know, you're on the top of a ski mountain,
[03:25:36.820 --> 03:25:40.060]   and on the one side is the I can't, it's too hard,
[03:25:40.060 --> 03:25:42.900]   and the other side is I can.
[03:25:42.900 --> 03:25:45.940]   We all have natural capability.
[03:25:45.940 --> 03:25:48.500]   I really believe this, every person.
[03:25:48.500 --> 03:25:51.940]   But it's just about figuring out how to get your skis,
[03:25:51.940 --> 03:25:53.740]   like to the beginning of the ski slope.
[03:25:53.740 --> 03:25:55.620]   And then maybe if we've practiced
[03:25:55.620 --> 03:25:58.420]   being on the I can't do hard things slope,
[03:25:58.420 --> 03:25:59.780]   our skis keep trying to turn,
[03:25:59.780 --> 03:26:02.300]   but we just have to keep getting them back.
[03:26:02.300 --> 03:26:04.900]   And so if we tell ourselves, I can't do this,
[03:26:04.900 --> 03:26:07.820]   and we just stay there, stagnant,
[03:26:07.820 --> 03:26:11.940]   but if you say, wait, smaller, smaller, smaller, smaller,
[03:26:11.940 --> 03:26:14.100]   like I used this with a client a while ago,
[03:26:14.100 --> 03:26:15.540]   I can't ask my boss for a raise.
[03:26:15.540 --> 03:26:16.860]   I know I deserve it.
[03:26:16.860 --> 03:26:18.100]   Cool, no problem.
[03:26:18.100 --> 03:26:19.420]   Let's make it smaller.
[03:26:19.420 --> 03:26:21.100]   Okay, what would be smaller?
[03:26:21.100 --> 03:26:22.700]   I don't know, let's get creative.
[03:26:22.700 --> 03:26:25.300]   Could you write down what you would say?
[03:26:25.300 --> 03:26:26.660]   Okay, no.
[03:26:26.660 --> 03:26:30.700]   Could you say the word to me five times out loud?
[03:26:30.700 --> 03:26:32.700]   Raise, raise, raise, raise, raise.
[03:26:32.700 --> 03:26:34.020]   I remember she laughed, she goes, I can do that.
[03:26:34.020 --> 03:26:35.140]   Cool, let's start there.
[03:26:35.140 --> 03:26:37.140]   Okay, she literally did that.
[03:26:37.140 --> 03:26:40.900]   What I think is so powerful about Ms. Edson's advice
[03:26:40.900 --> 03:26:44.300]   is as soon as we get even our skis a tiny bit
[03:26:44.300 --> 03:26:47.860]   into the I can circuit, the I can slope,
[03:26:47.860 --> 03:26:50.340]   we're actually just a lot more likely to stay there,
[03:26:50.340 --> 03:26:54.580]   or at least that becomes a bigger part of our identity.
[03:26:54.580 --> 03:26:55.420]   Right?
[03:26:55.420 --> 03:26:57.740]   So with this woman that I was working on this with,
[03:26:57.740 --> 03:26:59.340]   one of the things we were working on,
[03:26:59.340 --> 03:27:02.180]   it was just, okay, so you did that, amazing.
[03:27:02.180 --> 03:27:03.900]   The next thing, I even just had her play around things
[03:27:03.900 --> 03:27:06.340]   saying to me, can you say to me, I deserve a raise?
[03:27:06.340 --> 03:27:07.340]   It was very interesting.
[03:27:07.340 --> 03:27:09.300]   She had, I think this was one of the reasons
[03:27:09.300 --> 03:27:11.460]   she had trouble speaking up for it.
[03:27:11.460 --> 03:27:13.700]   It was really hard for her to embody that.
[03:27:13.700 --> 03:27:14.860]   We said that.
[03:27:14.860 --> 03:27:16.340]   She couldn't, I remember a week she said,
[03:27:16.340 --> 03:27:17.620]   I'm gonna write it down and bring it.
[03:27:17.620 --> 03:27:18.980]   She didn't.
[03:27:18.980 --> 03:27:20.340]   Again, I like parenting.
[03:27:20.340 --> 03:27:21.540]   I didn't punish her.
[03:27:21.540 --> 03:27:22.700]   I didn't send her to her room.
[03:27:22.700 --> 03:27:24.260]   I said, okay, that was just too big.
[03:27:24.260 --> 03:27:25.100]   Let's make it smaller.
[03:27:25.100 --> 03:27:26.260]   Let's write it together.
[03:27:26.260 --> 03:27:28.380]   Wrote some things down there, right?
[03:27:28.380 --> 03:27:32.740]   I then had her write it as an email and send it to me.
[03:27:32.740 --> 03:27:35.660]   And I then had her practice it with her best friend.
[03:27:35.660 --> 03:27:39.620]   And then she asked her boss for a raise.
[03:27:39.620 --> 03:27:40.860]   Like, I mean, like, I don't even,
[03:27:40.860 --> 03:27:42.260]   this, like, probably no one's surprised.
[03:27:42.260 --> 03:27:43.260]   Yeah, like, that makes sense.
[03:27:43.260 --> 03:27:45.060]   She'd gotten through a lot of steps,
[03:27:45.060 --> 03:27:47.700]   but it's just applicable in every area of your life.
[03:27:47.700 --> 03:27:49.180]   So even anyone listening,
[03:27:49.180 --> 03:27:51.380]   we all have something in our I can't category.
[03:27:51.380 --> 03:27:53.420]   This is too hard or I can't.
[03:27:53.420 --> 03:27:54.460]   And we just stay there.
[03:27:54.460 --> 03:27:58.180]   And if you hear Ms. Edson saying,
[03:27:58.180 --> 03:28:01.460]   wait, if something feels too hard to do,
[03:28:01.460 --> 03:28:04.460]   it only means that the first step isn't small enough.
[03:28:04.460 --> 03:28:07.100]   And if then the next smallest step feels too hard,
[03:28:07.100 --> 03:28:09.220]   no biggie, like no judgment,
[03:28:09.220 --> 03:28:12.140]   make it smaller, make it smaller, make it smaller.
[03:28:12.140 --> 03:28:15.540]   And then allow yourself to eventually build up from there.
[03:28:15.540 --> 03:28:16.380]   - Love it.
[03:28:16.380 --> 03:28:17.580]   - Love Ms. Edson.
[03:28:17.580 --> 03:28:19.900]   - I'm gonna thank you and Ms. Edson.
[03:28:19.900 --> 03:28:22.100]   Yes, thank you, Ms. Edson.
[03:28:22.100 --> 03:28:25.860]   I think the idea of lowering the stakes
[03:28:25.860 --> 03:28:28.740]   to be able to move forward is just spectacular.
[03:28:28.740 --> 03:28:29.580]   - Yeah.
[03:28:29.580 --> 03:28:31.220]   - And in everything.
[03:28:31.220 --> 03:28:33.980]   And I noticed you do that,
[03:28:33.980 --> 03:28:35.460]   by the way, I'm not like analyzing,
[03:28:35.460 --> 03:28:37.980]   I'm just saying you do that with parenting.
[03:28:37.980 --> 03:28:40.740]   I think there's so much tension around this notion
[03:28:40.740 --> 03:28:44.580]   of like creating healthy, productive, functional kids.
[03:28:44.580 --> 03:28:47.100]   And I think there is a lot of shame for parents
[03:28:47.100 --> 03:28:49.980]   when things aren't going great and people know it
[03:28:49.980 --> 03:28:51.100]   or they know it.
[03:28:51.100 --> 03:28:54.420]   And the idea of creating lower stakes
[03:28:54.420 --> 03:28:59.260]   in order to be able to make pretty big moves over time
[03:28:59.260 --> 03:29:02.180]   where they're required or just do nothing
[03:29:02.180 --> 03:29:03.940]   when sometimes that's what's required.
[03:29:03.940 --> 03:29:06.060]   - Yeah, and the similarity is so interesting.
[03:29:06.060 --> 03:29:07.580]   What I think that the powerful thing
[03:29:07.580 --> 03:29:11.140]   about Ms. Edson's advice is she's almost saying,
[03:29:11.140 --> 03:29:14.300]   make something small enough so you can get your first win.
[03:29:14.300 --> 03:29:16.540]   Having a win is really powerful.
[03:29:16.540 --> 03:29:17.460]   It's kind of addicting.
[03:29:17.460 --> 03:29:18.620]   You're like, what's my next win?
[03:29:18.620 --> 03:29:20.460]   Right, you're on the win circuit.
[03:29:20.460 --> 03:29:24.460]   You know, one of the reasons we wanna create
[03:29:24.460 --> 03:29:26.100]   so many more resources for parents
[03:29:26.100 --> 03:29:28.740]   and when parents come to us and even say,
[03:29:28.740 --> 03:29:31.100]   this is a problem, this is a problem, this is a problem,
[03:29:31.100 --> 03:29:33.820]   I often just start, I would say, okay,
[03:29:33.820 --> 03:29:35.780]   like what is the smallest thing would change
[03:29:35.780 --> 03:29:37.420]   that would make you, when you go to bed at night,
[03:29:37.420 --> 03:29:39.340]   you're like, today was a better day.
[03:29:39.340 --> 03:29:41.340]   Like, there's some bigger stuff, I hear you.
[03:29:41.340 --> 03:29:42.420]   Probably not gonna tackle that.
[03:29:42.420 --> 03:29:43.300]   We'll tackle that in time,
[03:29:43.300 --> 03:29:45.980]   but like, I wanna get you a win today.
[03:29:45.980 --> 03:29:50.340]   And then all of a sudden when a parent starts to build,
[03:29:50.340 --> 03:29:52.140]   it's kind of their own self-efficacy,
[03:29:52.140 --> 03:29:53.660]   their own like, oh, wait,
[03:29:53.660 --> 03:29:55.580]   I did feel good about that one moment.
[03:29:55.580 --> 03:29:57.100]   I did feel more connected to my kid.
[03:29:57.100 --> 03:29:59.100]   I said this one thing.
[03:29:59.100 --> 03:30:02.300]   It's, I mean, it's momentum, you know?
[03:30:02.300 --> 03:30:03.980]   And we have to give ourselves the opportunity
[03:30:03.980 --> 03:30:08.220]   to build momentum, which really usually only starts
[03:30:08.220 --> 03:30:10.780]   by taking the smallest step anyway.
[03:30:10.780 --> 03:30:14.180]   - I think it's spectacular, right?
[03:30:14.180 --> 03:30:16.980]   I was going to ask you, and I never do this,
[03:30:16.980 --> 03:30:18.140]   but I was gonna ask you, you know,
[03:30:18.140 --> 03:30:20.380]   if there were one thing that people could start
[03:30:20.380 --> 03:30:22.620]   the process of trying to be a better parent,
[03:30:22.620 --> 03:30:24.020]   better to themselves, you know,
[03:30:24.020 --> 03:30:25.020]   if it's more about, you know,
[03:30:25.020 --> 03:30:27.460]   more about emotional containment, et cetera.
[03:30:27.460 --> 03:30:29.820]   Maybe it's this thing of, you know, asking, you know,
[03:30:29.820 --> 03:30:31.980]   at the end of today, like, what would be one thing
[03:30:31.980 --> 03:30:33.860]   that would allow me to have said it was a better day?
[03:30:33.860 --> 03:30:35.100]   Would that be it?
[03:30:35.100 --> 03:30:35.940]   Certainly that's powerful.
[03:30:35.940 --> 03:30:37.140]   - I'm gonna give you two things.
[03:30:37.140 --> 03:30:39.460]   One is kind of a one small thing,
[03:30:39.460 --> 03:30:41.660]   but it's kind of a bigger theoretical thing.
[03:30:41.660 --> 03:30:44.580]   And one thing is very, very, very concrete.
[03:30:44.580 --> 03:30:47.700]   So the bigger thing.
[03:30:47.700 --> 03:30:49.860]   I really believe that the single biggest thing
[03:30:49.860 --> 03:30:53.620]   that gets in our way of feeling more empowered
[03:30:53.620 --> 03:30:57.380]   and capable as parents is that as much as we say
[03:30:57.380 --> 03:30:59.220]   we value parenting, and I think parents,
[03:30:59.220 --> 03:31:00.620]   people do, or parents are like, yeah,
[03:31:00.620 --> 03:31:02.620]   what do I care about more than parenting?
[03:31:02.620 --> 03:31:04.660]   It's kind of the lowest on our list
[03:31:04.660 --> 03:31:06.180]   in terms of what we invest in.
[03:31:06.180 --> 03:31:09.540]   You know, people invest in all types of things.
[03:31:09.540 --> 03:31:12.140]   And I wanna be clear, yes, like,
[03:31:12.140 --> 03:31:14.940]   we have an offering at Good Insight and our membership,
[03:31:14.940 --> 03:31:15.980]   but that's not what I mean.
[03:31:15.980 --> 03:31:17.500]   For someone listening, they might be like,
[03:31:17.500 --> 03:31:19.460]   there is that parent coach in my town
[03:31:19.460 --> 03:31:21.900]   who I've been like saying I'm gonna call,
[03:31:21.900 --> 03:31:22.900]   or maybe it's a therapist,
[03:31:22.900 --> 03:31:24.780]   or maybe it's a parenting group at your school,
[03:31:24.780 --> 03:31:26.580]   or maybe someone listens to me
[03:31:26.580 --> 03:31:28.260]   and they're like, no offense, Dr. Becky,
[03:31:28.260 --> 03:31:29.860]   there's someone else I follow on Instagram
[03:31:29.860 --> 03:31:32.700]   and they have a course and I like them better.
[03:31:32.700 --> 03:31:35.380]   I'd be like, do that today.
[03:31:35.380 --> 03:31:40.380]   Like align your even purchasing decisions with your values.
[03:31:40.380 --> 03:31:44.260]   Like that, and because we're not expected
[03:31:44.260 --> 03:31:46.260]   to know this naturally, we're not.
[03:31:46.260 --> 03:31:49.420]   And as long as we don't have the resources around us,
[03:31:49.420 --> 03:31:51.340]   a little kind of, someone described it to me
[03:31:51.340 --> 03:31:53.380]   as like a onesie, twosie thing.
[03:31:53.380 --> 03:31:57.220]   Like it's just not giving ourself what we deserve.
[03:31:57.220 --> 03:32:00.380]   It is like a surgeon saying they're not good at surgery
[03:32:00.380 --> 03:32:01.500]   when you find out they never went
[03:32:01.500 --> 03:32:03.420]   to medical school or residency.
[03:32:03.420 --> 03:32:06.060]   You'd be like, well, I just didn't really get resourced
[03:32:06.060 --> 03:32:08.540]   in the way you deserve for this very challenging job.
[03:32:08.540 --> 03:32:10.700]   So that would really be the thing if I'm really honest,
[03:32:10.700 --> 03:32:13.000]   'cause I'm not, as much as I'm about a quick win,
[03:32:13.000 --> 03:32:14.440]   I'm not about a quick fix.
[03:32:14.440 --> 03:32:17.160]   I think that just sets us up for more like a bandaid.
[03:32:17.160 --> 03:32:20.800]   Having said that, I love a quick thing.
[03:32:20.800 --> 03:32:23.540]   So a couple of things I think people can do with their kids.
[03:32:23.540 --> 03:32:25.500]   Telling your kid at night,
[03:32:25.500 --> 03:32:27.540]   and I'll model how I would say it.
[03:32:27.540 --> 03:32:28.780]   I think most people, it's not just me,
[03:32:28.780 --> 03:32:30.540]   when you put your kid to bed,
[03:32:30.540 --> 03:32:32.180]   it's like, oh, I just want to be on the couch,
[03:32:32.180 --> 03:32:33.220]   but it's when your kid's willing
[03:32:33.220 --> 03:32:34.940]   to spend five extra minutes with you,
[03:32:34.940 --> 03:32:36.940]   because it's the cruel irony at night.
[03:32:36.940 --> 03:32:37.980]   You want time without your kids
[03:32:37.980 --> 03:32:40.220]   and they just want a little bit more time with you.
[03:32:40.220 --> 03:32:42.260]   If you allow yourself to lean in
[03:32:42.260 --> 03:32:43.860]   and you can just say to your kid,
[03:32:43.860 --> 03:32:44.780]   almost like in a whisper,
[03:32:44.780 --> 03:32:47.020]   I think whispering to your kid
[03:32:47.020 --> 03:32:49.140]   is one of the most underutilized, simplest strategies.
[03:32:49.140 --> 03:32:50.420]   Whispers are so sacred.
[03:32:50.420 --> 03:32:51.340]   They feel sacred.
[03:32:51.340 --> 03:32:53.300]   They feel like they know they're just for you.
[03:32:53.300 --> 03:32:56.140]   Whispering to your kid, like,
[03:32:56.140 --> 03:33:00.180]   I just want to tell you there's nothing you could ever do
[03:33:00.180 --> 03:33:01.940]   that would make me stop loving you.
[03:33:01.940 --> 03:33:07.900]   Or, I just want to tell you you're a really good kid.
[03:33:07.900 --> 03:33:12.260]   We're in a hard stage, but I will never, ever,
[03:33:12.260 --> 03:33:16.900]   ever think of you as anything but a really good kid.
[03:33:16.900 --> 03:33:20.020]   Don't expect your kid to say anything.
[03:33:21.340 --> 03:33:24.700]   That takes 10 seconds.
[03:33:24.700 --> 03:33:26.340]   And if you're like, whispering feels awkward,
[03:33:26.340 --> 03:33:27.180]   don't whisper, just say it.
[03:33:27.180 --> 03:33:28.020]   It doesn't matter.
[03:33:28.020 --> 03:33:30.340]   If you're thinking, you don't know my kid,
[03:33:30.340 --> 03:33:32.540]   they're a teenager, text them.
[03:33:32.540 --> 03:33:33.780]   Text them.
[03:33:33.780 --> 03:33:35.260]   Sometimes a text to a teen can feel
[03:33:35.260 --> 03:33:38.460]   like an unexpected whisper from a parent, you know?
[03:33:38.460 --> 03:33:40.060]   And that's it.
[03:33:40.060 --> 03:33:42.780]   And that's the single thing today.
[03:33:42.780 --> 03:33:44.820]   And then maybe I'm gonna add a third.
[03:33:44.820 --> 03:33:46.060]   Just do something like that for yourself.
[03:33:46.060 --> 03:33:46.900]   Give yourself credit.
[03:33:46.900 --> 03:33:47.740]   Put your hand on your heart.
[03:33:47.740 --> 03:33:50.300]   Tell yourself, this parenting thing's really hard.
[03:33:50.300 --> 03:33:54.060]   Like, I'm doing enough.
[03:33:54.060 --> 03:33:55.540]   I'm not messing up my kid forever.
[03:33:55.540 --> 03:33:57.220]   That's not a thing.
[03:33:57.220 --> 03:33:58.620]   I'm like, and I've got this.
[03:33:58.620 --> 03:34:01.140]   - Awesome.
[03:34:01.140 --> 03:34:06.500]   Well, this whole thing that you've attempted to take on
[03:34:06.500 --> 03:34:10.020]   is also really hard, and you're doing incredible work
[03:34:10.020 --> 03:34:11.860]   educating people on how to parent.
[03:34:11.860 --> 03:34:13.180]   There's so many things that you've said today.
[03:34:13.180 --> 03:34:14.860]   I'm not gonna recap them all.
[03:34:14.860 --> 03:34:16.500]   You know, we do timestamps and all that
[03:34:16.500 --> 03:34:19.620]   so people can find them, but in no particular order.
[03:34:19.620 --> 03:34:24.020]   I mean, you know, this concept of telling a kid
[03:34:24.020 --> 03:34:27.340]   you're right to notice when they notice something important
[03:34:27.340 --> 03:34:29.620]   in you or in others or in themselves,
[03:34:29.620 --> 03:34:32.540]   that rigidity is the enemy.
[03:34:32.540 --> 03:34:37.420]   Asking, like, what's this really about
[03:34:37.420 --> 03:34:39.460]   when they're doing or saying something
[03:34:39.460 --> 03:34:41.500]   or expressing themselves in a way that feels confusing
[03:34:41.500 --> 03:34:43.660]   or maybe, especially when it's irritating.
[03:34:44.580 --> 03:34:45.420]   - Mm-hmm.
[03:34:45.420 --> 03:34:49.820]   - Encouraging frustration as a route to learning,
[03:34:49.820 --> 03:34:52.420]   like, incredible.
[03:34:52.420 --> 03:34:55.740]   And then you said the more that you can locate somebody,
[03:34:55.740 --> 03:34:58.300]   the more you respect their values,
[03:34:58.300 --> 03:35:02.020]   which I think is incredible, and on and on.
[03:35:02.020 --> 03:35:04.860]   I mean, there's just so many gems in today's conversation
[03:35:04.860 --> 03:35:08.980]   and so many actionable gems that you provide on social media
[03:35:10.260 --> 03:35:14.420]   through your courses, through conversations like this
[03:35:14.420 --> 03:35:16.780]   and others that you're holding in other podcasts.
[03:35:16.780 --> 03:35:19.380]   And I just wanna thank you so much.
[03:35:19.380 --> 03:35:23.740]   You know, you're teaching people how to parent others,
[03:35:23.740 --> 03:35:25.460]   how to think about their own parenting.
[03:35:25.460 --> 03:35:26.780]   Oh yes, that's the other one.
[03:35:26.780 --> 03:35:29.220]   You said the only kind of parenting that we do reflexively
[03:35:29.220 --> 03:35:31.660]   is the one that was done for us,
[03:35:31.660 --> 03:35:35.620]   which will evoke, you know, feelings of relaxation
[03:35:35.620 --> 03:35:38.420]   in some people and feelings of dread in others.
[03:35:38.420 --> 03:35:39.820]   But it all just speaks to the importance
[03:35:39.820 --> 03:35:42.780]   of paying attention to this thing that we call parenting.
[03:35:42.780 --> 03:35:45.860]   And I think the way that you're merging this
[03:35:45.860 --> 03:35:48.460]   with a thoughtful eye on technology,
[03:35:48.460 --> 03:35:50.460]   where it's taking us and where there are concerns,
[03:35:50.460 --> 03:35:53.460]   as well as, you know, where it can be utilized,
[03:35:53.460 --> 03:35:54.500]   it's just fantastic.
[03:35:54.500 --> 03:35:55.980]   I can't say enough good things
[03:35:55.980 --> 03:35:57.740]   about the work that you're doing,
[03:35:57.740 --> 03:36:00.300]   and I'm just so grateful that you're doing it.
[03:36:00.300 --> 03:36:02.740]   And I'm saying that on behalf of myself and everyone else.
[03:36:02.740 --> 03:36:04.700]   You're making the world a better place.
[03:36:04.700 --> 03:36:07.580]   So thank you so much for joining today
[03:36:07.580 --> 03:36:09.460]   and for sharing so much.
[03:36:09.460 --> 03:36:12.540]   We'll of course point out where people can find you,
[03:36:12.540 --> 03:36:14.220]   but just keep going.
[03:36:14.220 --> 03:36:15.180]   It's awesome.
[03:36:15.180 --> 03:36:16.020]   I've learned a ton.
[03:36:16.020 --> 03:36:17.780]   I know everyone else has as well.
[03:36:17.780 --> 03:36:18.620]   - Thank you.
[03:36:18.620 --> 03:36:20.220]   I'm honored to be back here a second time.
[03:36:20.220 --> 03:36:21.060]   I love speaking with you
[03:36:21.060 --> 03:36:22.860]   and look forward to the next time.
[03:36:22.860 --> 03:36:24.900]   - Likewise, we'll do it again.
[03:36:24.900 --> 03:36:26.660]   Thank you for listening to today's episode

[03:37:30.300 --> 03:37:32.480]   I discuss science and science-related tools,
[03:37:32.480 --> 03:37:33.940]   some of which overlaps with the content
[03:37:33.940 --> 03:37:35.260]   of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[03:37:35.260 --> 03:37:37.100]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[03:37:37.100 --> 03:37:38.460]   on the Huberman Lab podcast.
[03:37:38.460 --> 03:37:41.660]   So again, it's Huberman Lab on all social media channels.
[03:37:41.660 --> 03:37:42.860]   If you haven't already subscribed
[03:37:42.860 --> 03:37:44.340]   to our Neural Network newsletter,
[03:37:44.340 --> 03:37:45.620]   our Neural Network newsletter
[03:37:45.620 --> 03:37:47.460]   is a zero cost monthly newsletter
[03:37:47.460 --> 03:37:48.900]   that includes podcast summaries
[03:37:48.900 --> 03:37:50.900]   and what we call protocols in the form of brief
[03:37:50.900 --> 03:37:53.380]   one to three page PDFs that cover things
[03:37:53.380 --> 03:37:55.820]   like deliberate heat exposure, deliberate cold exposure,
[03:37:55.820 --> 03:37:58.980]   how to optimize your sleep, how to optimize your dopamine.
[03:37:58.980 --> 03:38:00.740]   We have a foundational fitness protocol
[03:38:00.740 --> 03:38:02.140]   that covers cardiovascular training,
[03:38:02.140 --> 03:38:03.460]   stretching and strength training.
[03:38:03.460 --> 03:38:05.820]   Again, all available at completely zero cost.
[03:38:05.820 --> 03:38:07.860]   You simply go to hubermanlab.com,
[03:38:07.860 --> 03:38:09.820]   go to the menu tab in the top right corner,
[03:38:09.820 --> 03:38:11.980]   scroll down to newsletter and sign up.
[03:38:11.980 --> 03:38:13.660]   And I should point out that we do not share
[03:38:13.660 --> 03:38:15.820]   your email with anybody.
[03:38:15.820 --> 03:38:17.020]   Thank you once again for joining me
[03:38:17.020 --> 03:38:19.340]   for today's discussion with Dr. Becky Kennedy.
[03:38:19.340 --> 03:38:21.100]   I hope you found it to be as informative
[03:38:21.100 --> 03:38:23.100]   and as actionable as I did.
[03:38:23.100 --> 03:38:25.200]   And last, but certainly not least,
[03:38:25.200 --> 03:38:27.160]   thank you for your interest in science.
[03:38:27.160 --> 03:38:29.740]   [upbeat music]
[03:38:29.740 --> 03:38:32.320]   (upbeat music)
