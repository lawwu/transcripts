[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai and in this podcast
[00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:09.840]   I want to talk about the regrets of someone selling his online business for millions of dollars
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.840]   Because I really want to highlight that money really isn't the focal point
[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.620]   for happiness and you hear it all the time money doesn't buy happiness
[00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.200]   but I seriously believe after certain amount whether it's about
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.600]   $75,000 if you're living in the heartland of America or
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:33.780]   $40,000 if you're living in an expensive coastal city once you have enough money to provide food shelter
[00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.580]   You know general living expenses entertainment some travel
[00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:45.080]   You're not gonna be that much happier if you have a lot more money. I've been tracking my money journey since
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:52.640]   2009 you know publicly but privately I've been writing about my money thoughts since 1999 when I first had a job and
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.080]   You know, I've gone from what $40,000 base salary living in New York City, which is like
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:05.760]   $24,000 a year living in Texas Dallas or Houston. It wasn't that much money and I was working
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.260]   70 80 hours a week and then I got to a point where I was making
[00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.560]   15 times that and still working about 60 hours a week, but I wasn't much happier
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.480]   In fact, I was kind of miserable
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:22.180]   Which is why I left my day job in 2012 to make no money because I wanted freedom
[00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.280]   I really wanted freedom and freedom is the X factor that
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.920]   Will allow you to feel like the richest person in the world
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:36.600]   if you got that compared to a billionaire who has to answer to thousands of shareholders and the stocks not doing well and
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.840]   He or she's constantly under stress
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.520]   so this podcast
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:49.400]   encapsulates one person's journey and thoughts and feelings on what transpired after he sold his online business for 2.8 million dollars and
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.320]   What he would have done differently and why he wished he would have held on
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.760]   For the past six months now
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.120]   I've been trying to figure out what to do with financial samurai after achieving the 10-year anniversary mark
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.480]   It takes a lot of work recording this podcast
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:09.360]   Writing posts responding to comments and emails and so forth, but it's been part of my life right for so long
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:16.200]   And I really thought about selling the site because I just want to do some new things, you know after 10 years
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.360]   I kind of have this 10 year cycle in me and then maybe I have I don't know
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.280]   Hopefully four more 10 years and I'm dead
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:29.380]   So we all got a thing about these cycles some cycles are longer than others because some of us have different endurance
[00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.480]   qualities than others
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:37.320]   So I've been searching searching for reasons why I should sell and searching for reasons why I shouldn't sell
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.640]   And this is a good practice for all of you guys to do
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.520]   Because if you decide to do something you're gonna find reasons why it's right to do that something
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.960]   So you also got to find reasons and be subjective not subjective
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:56.400]   Objective and try to find the other side so you can see all sides of the equation
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.760]   So a friend of mine sold his website for 2.8 million in
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:07.960]   2010 he started it for a thousand dollars back then and when I started financial salmon 2009
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:13.960]   It was also about a thousand dollars because I had to hire someone to set it up get the design and so forth
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:19.720]   But today you can start a site for something like 50 bucks or 100 bucks and you can do it much more quickly
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:26.560]   Which is why everybody should try to start something online at least have their own website and don't let you know
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.120]   The Facebook's and LinkedIn's and so forth get rich off you get rich off yourself
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.240]   And at least give yourself a chance
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:39.000]   But anyway enough about that. So he started the site with a thousand dollars and he sold it for 2.8 million
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.920]   So that's a twenty eight hundred X return which is better than practically every single angel investment ever out there
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.600]   better than investing in uber at the angel round or Airbnb and
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.920]   Definitely better than investing in like SoftBank and we work as we work goes the other way
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.120]   So he thought
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:05.200]   That by selling the site he would free up valuable time to take care of his young boy and it did he was 30 years old
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:12.400]   But after six months, he wasn't satisfied with only being a stay-at-home dad after working so hard on his business for so many years
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:19.520]   When his boy turned one, he decided to send him to daycare so he can go back to his old routine of building a business
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:25.840]   This is what he is passionate about building online businesses and seeing them grow and at two and a half years old
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.360]   He decided to send his boy to preschool and his wife worked a full-time job as well
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:37.600]   He also thought that by cashing out in 2010, he would feel a lot happier
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.520]   You know, there's a tremendous amount of uncertainty back in 2010
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:49.080]   I was just about a year maybe just six months after the worst of the financial crisis had passed and I remember that time quite clearly
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:56.920]   Everybody was still losing their jobs and he thought by selling at least he could just get that win because other
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.040]   Businesses that he noticed went to zero
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:04.680]   Despite the nice payout. He still wishes he would have never sold and here are the reasons why
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.560]   One he felt like he had lost a child
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.140]   Years before the birth of his son. He birthed his website
[00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:16.160]   Selling the site made him depressed that he no longer had a baby to nurture
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:23.800]   For almost seven years. He looked forward to working on his website before and after work and when he got laid off in 2009
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.720]   He spent 60 plus hours a week on the website
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.600]   Sometimes he spent way more time on his business than he did his own biological child
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:37.680]   And that's not a surprise because many working parents spend way more time at work than raising their children, too
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:45.560]   He loved his business as he would any child and when he sold he felt like the worst father ever
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:52.240]   And here's the thing selling something you love for money is a horrible horrible feeling he says
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.760]   You will only realize how much you love that something until it's gone
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:01.640]   We all know this from breakups from being far away from losing whatever it is
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:08.980]   We took for granted and the irony is you need to sell to realize whether you made the right choice or not
[00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:14.400]   If you feel nothing after you sell that is how you know, you made the right decision
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.240]   - he lost his sense of purpose
[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:23.680]   He underestimated how important it was to look forward to having something to do every single day
[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:28.600]   If you look the Maslow's hierarchy of needs on the very top is self fulfillment needs
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:34.520]   self-actualization achieving one's full potential including creative activities
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.080]   So three he lost that creative outlet
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:43.280]   Do you remember when we were kids we'd make paper mâchés and clay figurines and draw random things?
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.220]   It was fun. We got our hands dirty. We
[00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:50.160]   Expanded our minds. We just thought of crazy things to create
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:55.040]   So once he sold he tried to pick up guitar, but that didn't last very long
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:07:00.920]   He said he should have known because he had his guitar gathering dust next to his bed for the past eight years
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:06.160]   Then he tried painting but that wasn't easy. It was a little bit too messy
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:11.680]   He didn't have a big house where he could throw all his paper on the ground and just paint like crazy
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.580]   So after a couple works of art, he gave up
[00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:19.880]   All he wanted to do was go back to his website and create and build upon that foundation
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:24.960]   But he didn't have it and he couldn't for the first year because those non compete
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:29.680]   For this is a big one. He left so much money on the table
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:33.920]   It turns out in retrospect selling in 2010 was not a good idea
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:39.960]   Because it was the bottom of the stock market bottom on the real estate market and bottom of the economy
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.240]   It was a really critical error
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:48.640]   The site he said was churning out an operating profit of about six hundred thousand dollars a year
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:54.280]   So at the time he thought selling for 2.5 million plus a three hundred thousand dollar earn out was a good price
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:57.520]   But some of the sites that were smaller than his
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:04.880]   Kept on going to the point where they started making about a million dollars in operating profit by 2019 and some as early as
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:07.520]   2017 so not only that
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:13.200]   Valuations for websites went up to along with valuations of the SP 500
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:16.640]   So if he had kept his operating profits flat
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:19.200]   Let's say at six hundred thousand a year
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.280]   if he had held on for five more years
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:27.520]   He would have made another three million dollars and then he could have sold a site for more like four point two million dollars instead
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:33.480]   Of two point five million dollars plus a maybe six hundred thousand dollar earn out due to higher valuations
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:38.800]   So all in all he thinks he left about five million at least
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:43.720]   Up to about eleven million on the table if he could have just hung on until now
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:47.580]   So this is a really critical point for entrepreneurs out there
[00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:55.480]   Especially with cash flow positive businesses you want to hold on for as long as possible if you can just keep profits flat
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:59.000]   Well, that's kind of like gravy every single day
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:05.200]   Valuations stay the same and you can still sell the business if you are a worker an employee
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:10.960]   You're trading your time for money. And if you don't work, you don't get paid and
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:16.920]   There's no exit if you exit there's not a big pile of equity you can cash in on well
[00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:18.920]   Some of you will have that if you work at a startup
[00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:23.800]   You know tech company or whatever that gives you a lot of equity. So really think about
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:27.520]   How to generate wealth it's your income
[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:36.040]   Plus equity the equity component is really what makes a lot of these very wealthy people the richest it's not the income folks
[00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:41.040]   Five he wasted his time trying to recreate a successful business
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:47.920]   During his year-long non-compete. He tried to start three new businesses in different fields that all failed
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:53.420]   After his non-compete was over. He tried starting a couple other websites similar to the one he had
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.520]   But they didn't gain any traction
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:10:00.960]   so all told he wasted about three years of his life trying to get back what he lost and it
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:05.160]   Infuriated him to know that all he could have done was spent that time
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:10.760]   compounding and building on top of the already successful business he already had and
[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:14.880]   He could have saved time and made even more money
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:18.280]   Six his baby was finally killed
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:25.320]   Four years after his site was purchased the acquire redirected his site to land on some other business they owned
[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:32.400]   Essentially they killed the site and all the time he had put into it and it felt like a knife in his heart
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:37.200]   He said he just couldn't believe that after all those years
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:40.120]   He thought it was gonna last forever
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:47.640]   But the steward decided to get rid of it and that was really a really big blow as you get older
[00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:50.440]   You start thinking about leaving a legacy for your children
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:58.600]   Unfortunately, you can't if your baby got killed you want to tell your children what you did to serve your country
[00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:01.480]   to provide for your family and
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:07.560]   one of the biggest and best ways to do that is to build a business because you can see it and you can also use
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:13.160]   That business to provide for your children and maybe get them a job in their family business, but all that went away
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:21.120]   Seven he started taking shortcuts that made him feel ashamed because he was so desperate to recreate
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:25.000]   His success and glory he started cheating
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.880]   He started doing a lot of scammy link building exercises to try to game the search engines like Google
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:37.380]   He started taking ideas from many other established sites and just copying their articles with their own spin
[00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:41.060]   I've seen that happen a lot with financial samurai this one guy
[00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:47.800]   He copies literally all of my successful posts and just recreates it on his own
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:51.400]   And he pretends like it's his idea. It's pretty annoying
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:57.960]   This guy also copies the way I write my author bio with my affiliate links
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:05.620]   It's fascinating how there's so much blatant copying going on right now, and it's disappointing. But what are you gonna do?
[00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:10.280]   So he no longer was trying to create something original that he was proud of
[00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:18.600]   He just hired a bunch of freelancers to put up a bunch of crap online and that crap worked because Google can't really tell the
[00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:25.260]   Difference yet between crap and something really really authentic and he put a lot of advertising dollars behind the content
[00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:30.260]   Even though it was boring as crap because he had figured out a way to game the system
[00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.320]   eight
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:35.000]   He became irrelevant in his community
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.920]   This is a really important one and something that I felt when I left my day job in 2012
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:47.400]   After I left finance, you know suddenly I didn't hang out with the clients. I didn't hang out with my peers because I was irrelevant
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:50.000]   I wasn't providing any value and he felt the same way
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.800]   When he had his site everybody gave him the time of day
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:56.640]   Journalists would ask him for a quote
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:59.900]   He would be invited to come on podcasts and TV
[00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:05.520]   other bloggers and website owners would say nice things about him and his site and
[00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:09.960]   His offline friends would refer to him as a successful entrepreneur
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:12.600]   And once he sold all that went away
[00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:18.240]   He lost contact with all his peers who he had thought were his friends. They were outwardly
[00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:24.280]   Congratulatory. Hey, good job selling. I'm so proud of you seven years. Good job. Good job
[00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:29.960]   But behind his back they just stopped caring he could no longer help promote their work
[00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:33.280]   so they stopped giving him any love and
[00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:39.440]   The podcast and interview request stopped as well. So once you lose what makes you valuable
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:44.200]   You're gonna really truly recognize who your friends are. Oh
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:52.480]   And he admitted that he decided to buy himself back into the conversation by sponsoring various activities in the community
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:59.260]   Right buying access buying friends and he did get recognized as that's how it is
[00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.800]   It's all incestuous. It's pay-to-play in many many
[00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:09.600]   Organizations, but deep down he felt sad that he didn't have more organic friendships in the community
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:17.100]   And I think everybody can recognize that is it organic? Are you buying your way to influence power and friendship?
[00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:23.800]   Nine, he didn't fully reinvest his proceeds in 2010 if you think about back at the time
[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:25.440]   It was a dicey situation
[00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:30.200]   So if you arrive at a chunk of cash, the last thing you want to do is lose it
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:37.840]   So he fearing a double-dip recession after selling just hoarded cash for the most part and it was only until
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:45.760]   2016 did he admit he invested 50% of the proceeds so by then he had missed out on a very healthy rally that probably cost him
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:47.440]   about
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.440]   $500,000 in lost gains
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:56.040]   So talk about adding salt in the wound after already missing out on five million to eleven million in
[00:14:56.320 --> 00:15:03.000]   Gains from holding on if you had held on and then another five hundred thousand. That's a tough pill to swallow
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:09.680]   So when you're presented with a windfall, it's really hard to immediately put that money to work
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:16.160]   I felt the same way back in 2017 second half of 2017 when I sold my San Francisco rental property
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:23.280]   I sold it for two point seven four five million dollars and I walked away after fees and all that with about 1.8 million
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:27.280]   I had to pay obviously a mortgage that was like eight hundred ten thousand or something
[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:30.840]   but 1.8 million is a lot of money and
[00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:37.640]   Actually, that's a very similar amount of money to what he got after taxes. And so I was very methodical
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:41.520]   What I did was I invested about six hundred thousand in
[00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:49.120]   Municipal bonds right as safe as you can get double a triple a they're paying about three to three and a quarter percent
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:56.160]   After tax and then I bought about six hundred thousand dollars in large-cap high dividend paying stocks
[00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:00.880]   Which is my risk side and then I I think I invested no
[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:06.360]   I know I invested five hundred fifty thousand in real estate crowdfunding in a diversified portfolio of 17 different
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:10.400]   Commercial real estate properties and I held about fifty thousand dollars in cash
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:16.820]   So that's what I did and it took me about I would say four or five months to reinvest that windfall
[00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:23.600]   So it didn't take me five six years like my friend did but you know, it was a really stressful process
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:26.360]   and then finally
[00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:30.320]   Taxes taxes taxes taxes taxes took so much away
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:35.680]   He sold his business for 2.5 million excluding the 300,000 earn out a year later
[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:41.240]   But he only ended up with 1.75 million after paying federal and state taxes
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:47.560]   2.75 million. Hey great amount of money, but by selling your business you're essentially
[00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:53.000]   Surrendering yourself to the government and saying take all my money when you're operating your business
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:59.440]   You can find many many ways to reduce your taxable income. You can spend more money on
[00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:06.200]   Advertisement you can buy a heavy truck or SUV, you know for to take your clients around
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:10.160]   You can go to Greece to do your business off-site
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:14.240]   Whatever it is, you can spend money to reduce your taxable income legally
[00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:17.580]   So if you think about what the effective tax rate is
[00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:21.860]   Running your business versus after you sell your business
[00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:27.400]   There's a big difference and he was saying that by running his business his effective tax rate was closer to about 20%
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:31.320]   But when he sold the business he paid a 30% effective tax rate
[00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:37.760]   So a 10% effective tax rate difference can really add up over time over a seven-year period
[00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:40.840]   It's like doubling the value right in the world of 72
[00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:45.280]   So think about taxes before you sell a business as well
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:50.980]   Because that can really get you going if you're gonna give so much to the government
[00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:54.460]   Especially if you believe that government is inefficient with your money
[00:17:54.460 --> 00:18:02.680]   So I hope you enjoyed that deep insightful feedback that I got that he has shared because we talked for hours
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:07.580]   Because I was just in a quandary on what to do and I know a lot of this is me
[00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:10.520]   Projecting myself and believing hey
[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:16.480]   This is the right thing to do by keeping financial samurai and seeing whether entrepreneurship a little bit more entrepreneurship
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:23.860]   Will do wonders. I want to try I want to try to see if I can make more money off financial samurai by tweaking the
[00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:30.860]   formula a bit from 90% fun 10% business to 70% fun 30% business and from a
[00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:37.240]   Increase of 10% to 30% that's a big jump relatively given what I've been used to for the past 10 years
[00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:41.560]   And so if you have a profitable business and you know
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:49.600]   What the path is going forward in other words if you work 10 more hours or produce this many more posts or?
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:57.160]   Produce a new product once a year and you see that path to profitability continue you want to hold on for dear life
[00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:00.960]   Think about all the massive businesses in the world
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:09.320]   Mars Inc that creates pet food and candy or coca-cola. They were founded almost a hundred more than a hundred years ago and
[00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:14.840]   They survived through the bad times because during those bad times they use their cash
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:22.200]   Their smarts their experience to iterate and get better and come up with new products and new ideas and take more market share
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:30.120]   In a low interest rate environment. It is imperative that you hold on to your cash generating assets
[00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:38.000]   Cash is so valuable when it's you know, the 10-year yield is only at one point five to one point nine percent
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.240]   It takes a lot a lot of capital to produce a certain amount of income
[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:45.600]   for example
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:50.320]   55,000 you need at a 5% interest rate 1.1 1 million to generate
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:55.440]   55,000 but when interest rates fall to 2% you now need
[00:19:56.760 --> 00:20:03.760]   2.75 million and when the interest rate falls to 1% you need 5.5 million in capital to generate that
[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:11.000]   55,000 so if you're still on the fence about starting a business, I highly encourage you to start and try
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.680]   You just never know what might happen. Thanks so much everyone if you enjoyed this podcast
[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:19.920]   I'd appreciate it positive review and I'll talk to you guys later
