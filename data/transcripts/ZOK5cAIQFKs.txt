[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:11.440]   I'm Cal Newport, and this is Deep Questions, episode 174.
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.580]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:22.080]   I'm here in my Deep Work HQ, joined by my producer, Jesse.
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.080]   Jesse, something I am supposed to do and I always forget to do,
[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.540]   so I'm going to do it today, is tell people,
[00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.400]   and I'm not saying the right things here,
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.000]   but tell people if you like the podcast,
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.360]   consider leaving a review so that people who are interested in the show can see that people like it.
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.080]   If you listen but don't subscribe, subscribe.
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.440]   Are these the right things to ask people to do?
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.880]   Yeah, people should definitely subscribe to your podcast.
[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.880]   All right, there we go. I used to tell my listeners,
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.640]   I would only do this once a month,
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.240]   and then I just forgot to do it altogether.
[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.720]   So here we go.
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.040]   This is how you know I'm not a digital media native.
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.760]   So yeah, do that. I think it's helpful.
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.160]   Might as well tell people about your YouTube channel too.
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.440]   Yeah, okay. As long as we're doing this.
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.600]   The YouTube channel has the videos of every question asked,
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.280]   it has videos of the full episodes,
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.360]   it has videos of every segment we do,
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.800]   so you can save, refer to, and share all of that.
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.320]   So go check that out.
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.720]   YouTube is something you can subscribe to too, right?
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.200]   Yeah. Okay. But what does that do?
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.200]   Does that matter?
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.560]   With the podcast, subscribing makes sense to me
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.720]   because then it means they'll see all the new episodes.
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.520]   I don't know what it means to subscribe on YouTube.
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.480]   What happens? When you subscribe on YouTube
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.760]   and you get notifications, which you'd be all about,
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.480]   getting notifications on your phone.
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.360]   That's exactly what I want people to do.
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.000]   Is there a feed?
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.600]   If you subscribe to some channels
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.240]   and you go to YouTube.com, is it like,
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.280]   "Oh, here's new videos from people you subscribe to"?
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.360]   I don't get any notifications on any of my, including YouTube,
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.400]   so, but you just, if you're at the channel,
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.440]   you can go in, you can see stuff,
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.840]   but people do get notifications.
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.520]   They get notified when a new video comes up.
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.000]   Now, does it help trick YouTube
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.040]   into telling more people about your videos
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.360]   if more people are subscribed?
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.320]   Is there some sort of stuff like that going on?
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.160]   Yeah, probably. Yeah.
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.000]   Okay.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   'Cause comments, subscribers, views, likes, all that stuff.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.560]   Yeah. All right.
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.840]   Well, do those things, don't do those things, I don't know.
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.200]   I'm terrible at this.
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.040]   Guys, here's what I do.
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.240]   I get in front of the mic and I answer your questions
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.960]   and so, subscribe to things,
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.240]   leave a review for the podcast if people know you like it,
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.440]   and I won't bother you about this again for a while.
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.280]   All right, so new segment.
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.760]   We wanna try something new.
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.040]   So back in the early days of this podcast,
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.680]   back when it was just me all by myself,
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.560]   I used to do a segment where I would give updates
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.800]   about what was going on in the life of Cal Newport.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.600]   So I'm a very private person,
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.320]   but I would, on things I was comfortable talking about,
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.320]   give a little bit of insight
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.000]   into what was going on into my life.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.080]   A little bit weird doing these segments
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.320]   because it's myself basically just talking about myself.
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.200]   But now it occurred to me, now that we have Jesse here,
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.560]   we could rejuvenate this segment,
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.240]   which I call Behind the Curtain,
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.600]   since, well, we are in a room surrounded by curtains.
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.040]   So it's like what happens outside of this room,
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.640]   a segment called Behind a Curtain,
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.720]   where Jesse will be the proxy for you, my audience,
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.880]   and Jesse will ask me some questions
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.680]   about what's going on in my life.
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.400]   I have not seen these questions ahead of time,
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.120]   so these are new to me.
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.840]   And Jesse, let me make it clear,
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.360]   if I don't like them, you're fired.
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.160]   So let's just put that on the table.
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.360]   - Take that $250,000 a month and go buy a new truck.
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.320]   - I am gonna spend that on YouTube subscriptions.
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.440]   Is that how that works?
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.800]   Can I spend money on YouTube subscriptions?
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.920]   - One thing you can do on YouTube
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.880]   is you can subscribe to YouTube Premium,
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.360]   and you don't get the ads and you get the music.
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.800]   It's actually only like $9 a month.
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.000]   I do it, it's unbelievable.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.320]   - I should probably do that too.
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.480]   - You save so much time when you don't have to watch ads
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.000]   and it just goes right to the video.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.040]   - So do YouTube Premium.
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.040]   All right, do YouTube Premium, subscribe,
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.720]   leave reviews, I don't know, smoke signals,
[00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.200]   send me encouraging telegrams so I know what's going on.
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.320]   Write to your congressman and say,
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.640]   I like what Cal Newport is doing.
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.920]   Send cards to your network executives, I don't know.
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.240]   I don't know, guys, I'm terrible at that.
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.440]   All right, Jesse, behind the curtain,
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.680]   you have some questions for me
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.760]   about what's going on in my life.
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.120]   All right, I think I'm ready for it.
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.040]   - All right, so I got a bunch of questions here.
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.000]   So I'm just gonna fire a couple off and we'll see how it goes.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.560]   Can you give any updates on your Zittelkasten experiment?
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.560]   - All right, you're fired.
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.720]   - Next, let's move on.
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.000]   The reason why I ask is 'cause I remember
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.080]   you had the interview with the fellow
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.080]   back over the summertime.
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.880]   And I was actually, I was in a cool place.
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.640]   I was on a jog in Scotland on a golf trip.
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.480]   And I was doing that jog in the morning and I heard this.
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.600]   And I was like, this sounds cool.
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.360]   And then I was in a cool place too, near the beach,
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.640]   in this nature area.
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.040]   But anyway, so I remember that.
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.400]   And then you've talked about it a few times,
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.080]   so I wanted to know what's going on with that.
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.920]   - It's a timely question
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.840]   'cause I was talking to Srini recently.
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.120]   So one of the ideas, I was talking to Srini,
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.080]   I was like, man, I should just have you call into the show.
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.720]   And we could do like a Zittelkasten back and forth,
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.720]   like just like a 10 minute, 15 minute thing.
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.040]   So I think we could technically do that, right?
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.360]   Like we could have him call in on Zoom or something,
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.200]   'cause he lives in Colorado,
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.640]   so he's not be able to get here easily.
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:38.920]   But we could have him call in on Zoom
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.800]   and like we could just do a Zittelkasten
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.600]   'cause he has a lot of thoughts.
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.280]   He has a lot of thoughts on what I've been saying.
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.640]   And he thinks like I'm missing out on some of the value.
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:48.680]   So I think that'd be cool.
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:49.760]   We could have a back and forth.
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.080]   In my own life, I haven't made any big steps forward.
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.520]   I mean, I'm still in the place where I want Roam,
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.080]   the tool Roam to be the primary place
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.480]   in which I'm capturing most notes
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.000]   that are with the exception of CS research,
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.360]   which requires math notation, it's a whole separate thing.
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.360]   Or writing ideas and book ideas
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.400]   and article ideas and all that.
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.040]   I want that all to be in Roam,
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:14.320]   roughly indexed in a Zittelkasten style
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.040]   where there's a central index,
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.360]   but then also bi-directional links.
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.560]   And I haven't really upgraded that yet
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.120]   because I've been slammed,
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.960]   which is its own issue I'm having in my life right now.
[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.840]   It's self-enforced, self-imposed,
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.600]   but pretty brutal these past months with my workload.
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.680]   And to me, that's something you do when you have some time.
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:38.120]   So I'm thinking as the spring gives way towards summer
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.640]   and my schedule opens up,
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:43.440]   I want Zittelkasten style system
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.000]   basically capturing the place where I capture
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.480]   most of my ideas, 'cause I have a lot of ideas.
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:49.320]   And so we'll see.
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.000]   And so we'll have Srinian, he can help me out.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.800]   And then you also just read that book
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.280]   back in January, right?
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.200]   Yeah, I mean, that book, "How to Take Smart Notes"
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.280]   is what really introduced me to Zittelkasten.
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.720]   And it was a cool book and I liked it.
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:03.760]   And I recommend it actually.
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.880]   And a listener sent it to me just out of the blue.
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.240]   So I'll report back, but maybe what I'll do,
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.760]   here's what I'll do is when I have time,
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:12.360]   I'll have Srinian and have him be my guru.
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.760]   Like let's just 15 minutes, walk me through.
[00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:17.520]   Let me ask you my highly technical questions
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:18.840]   about how to get this right.
[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:20.120]   And then I'll go try it out.
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.160]   So I remain intrigued by Zittelkasten.
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.680]   I have heard from a lot of people, however,
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.760]   that agree with my central complaint
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.360]   that Zittelkasten can't do thinking for you.
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:29.840]   It can't write articles for you.
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:33.240]   It's not, in almost any position,
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:36.200]   this idea that you're just going to wander
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.480]   through your Zittelkasten system
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.880]   and come out on the other side with an article
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:43.360]   or a book or an academic paper is just not how that works.
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.760]   But it's a really cool way to probably organize a lot
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:47.920]   of thoughts that aren't easily put
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:50.000]   into some sort of hierarchical categories.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   - Okay, moving on, kind of related,
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.840]   talking about lifestyle centric planning,
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:59.800]   which you discuss quite a bit.
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.040]   For your own life, do you think you're close?
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:06.840]   - I think changes are looming.
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:09.560]   I think changes are looming that would get me closer.
[00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:14.480]   So I've done extreme lifestyle centric career planning.
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:17.000]   I mean, it's why I'm a professor
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.720]   and not in tech startups or venture capital
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:20.680]   or something like this.
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:22.680]   It's why I write books.
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:28.240]   Very autonomous and interesting income stream
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.200]   and very interesting to me.
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.560]   It's why we live in Tacoma Park.
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:35.600]   That was very much a lifestyle centric career planning,
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:39.360]   very explicit planning process of where do we want to live
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.120]   and why we want to live there.
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:46.280]   Right now, I would say the main obstacle
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:49.880]   between where I am right now and the very clear lifestyle,
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.920]   and I gotta say, I have this written out very clearly
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:53.120]   in my strategic plans documents.
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:56.160]   I mean, I know the bullet points of what goes
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.800]   into the lifestyle that I'm working backwards
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:01.920]   to try to get in place.
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:04.160]   Right now, I still have too much on my plate.
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.960]   And so the old joke on the podcast is I have 17 jobs,
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:10.840]   but I need seven instead of 17.
[00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:15.840]   So that's, I think, the next evolution to come
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:19.960]   is it's to be a full-time this and a full-time that
[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:23.000]   and a full-time that, like three or four multiple things.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.800]   It's just the volume of work is too much.
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:30.480]   My ideal lifestyle is slower and way more autonomous.
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:34.720]   Less things, high stakes, like, hey, deliver a book.
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.920]   Deliver a really good New Yorker piece.
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.120]   So high stakes, but you have nothing
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.080]   on your calendar tomorrow.
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:42.920]   It's up to you.
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:43.760]   You gotta figure this out.
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:44.640]   You need to make this work done.
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.240]   So I'm working on that.
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:49.840]   There's some early stage visions we're working on
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:53.560]   right now too about community investment,
[00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:56.960]   getting a little bit more involved in Tacoma Park.
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:59.520]   Maybe we need having some more,
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:01.840]   I don't wanna get too much into it,
[00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:03.680]   but some sort of commercial presence here.
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:05.360]   Do we wanna be, so there's a lot of thoughts we have
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:08.680]   about being more integrated into what's going on
[00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:11.560]   in our town, which I think is interesting too.
[00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:14.120]   So it's an ongoing process.
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:14.960]   Right now I have too much.
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:16.920]   In the moment, I have way too much, but strategic.
[00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:20.040]   So I took on a lot of extra work
[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:21.520]   'cause it's gonna help.
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:22.480]   I think it's important.
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.040]   The thing I'm doing is short-lived
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.080]   and I think it's important.
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.600]   And I think it's also gonna maybe be important
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:28.360]   for the lifestyle I want down the line.
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.960]   But right now I'm just being crushed by it.
[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.880]   So I'm definitely in a mode right now
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:36.480]   where I'm thinking through what I wanna, wanna,
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:37.320]   wanna get there.
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:40.040]   'Cause right now I'm just being crushed with overload.
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:42.240]   Yeah, you've seen it, you've seen it.
[00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.920]   You know, I'm kind of in and out right now.
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:47.360]   Like it is, there's too much going on.
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.680]   Having too much is just not good.
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:52.760]   Now I'm doing it on purpose
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.520]   and for a temporary amount of time.
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:57.320]   It's an initiative at Georgetown I think is very important,
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:59.120]   but it brings with it a lot of work.
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:02.960]   I probably should have aggressively slowed down
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.840]   other things to compensate, but I didn't.
[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:07.040]   I added it on top of the stuff that was working just fine
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.720]   and now it doesn't add up and work just fine.
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.440]   And it's too much stuff and it's organized
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:11.720]   because I'm very organized.
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:13.120]   So it's not like I'm disorganized
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:15.960]   and I have the, technically I have the time for it.
[00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:19.240]   The issue is, and this is a core idea of slow productivity,
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:20.400]   when there's too much on your plate,
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.600]   no matter, even if you do have the time to get it done
[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:23.440]   and you're super organized,
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:24.560]   it's still short circuits everything.
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:26.960]   It stresses you out and it's not healthy.
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:29.720]   So it's a good kind of kick in the butt right now
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.480]   to be like, okay, once I finish this,
[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:33.520]   I really got to get pretty aggressive again
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:37.440]   at pursuing the lifestyle I have in mind.
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:40.000]   - Makes sense.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.120]   Kind of going with a broader question here.
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:46.080]   You've discussed the book, "4,000 Weeks"
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:48.640]   that you read recently, you told Tim Ferriss about.
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:50.720]   I haven't read it yet, but I will.
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:55.400]   And generally, do you find that time goes by very fast?
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:58.760]   - Yes.
[00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:03.680]   Yeah, I mean, it depends on what's going on.
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:06.120]   These type of seasons like winter,
[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:09.120]   where it's, there's a lot going on,
[00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.760]   it's this, then this, then this, then this,
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:13.160]   like this day's basketball and this day I teach.
[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.440]   And so you have this sort of very regular schedule
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:18.320]   that each day is different than the one before,
[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:19.760]   but it's regular each time.
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:22.080]   I always feel like time moves very fast during those seasons
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:24.680]   and then when you're in like the summer
[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:27.320]   and there's not a schedule like that
[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:29.480]   and it's much more autonomous,
[00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:30.720]   I feel like time moves much slower.
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.880]   So summer feels like a long time to me.
[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:37.200]   Usually winter feels very fast.
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.600]   Like, are we in February already?
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:39.440]   We're in mid-February already.
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:40.880]   I mean, I don't mind it because like winter's
[00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:45.880]   not the best time anyways, but yeah, winter's fast.
[00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:49.960]   - And then, so does that lead to like broader thoughts
[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:52.080]   about getting older and stuff like that
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:53.440]   and not being able to do certain things
[00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:54.280]   or not really for you?
[00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:57.080]   - Like that's the "4,000 Weeks" things.
[00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.520]   I'll tell you, I definitely started thinking about that
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:04.440]   with 40 looming, right?
[00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:08.680]   'Cause there's a lot of things,
[00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:12.000]   especially if you're looking at bigger types of achievements
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.960]   there's a lot of things where you say,
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:18.720]   if that's not happened by 40, that's not on your list.
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:21.160]   This is like a key Oliver Berkman thing.
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.320]   Like I think about this with writing.
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:24.360]   Like I've been a successful writer.
[00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:27.160]   There's writers that are a lot more successful.
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:30.440]   You would think, yeah, you're where you're gonna be.
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:31.600]   Like you've taken your swings.
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:35.120]   You've been doing this since you were 20 years old.
[00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:36.600]   You've written seven books.
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:39.400]   Like you've taken your swings and it's gone well.
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:43.080]   But if you were gonna be a absolute top
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:44.520]   of the market writer, you'd be an absolute top
[00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:45.800]   of the market writer.
[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:46.920]   Like same thing with computer science.
[00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:48.560]   Like you've done good computer science,
[00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:50.200]   but if you're gonna be like a breakout brain
[00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:51.480]   in that world, you would have been a breakout brain
[00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:52.320]   in that world.
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:53.800]   You've been doing this for a long time, you know?
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:55.440]   And I never really, in the 30s,
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:57.440]   you still feel like you're working on things.
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:02.000]   40 feels like, yeah, this is where,
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.320]   these are my levels, so how do we build a life around it?
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:06.480]   And that might be overly pessimistic,
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:09.200]   but that's kind of an Oliver Berkman point, which I like.
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:11.160]   As big as that.
[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.400]   There is one key exception to that, though.
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:16.040]   So I've gone down a Taylor Sheridan rabbit hole.
[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:17.560]   You know this guy?
[00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:18.400]   - No.
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:21.200]   - Okay, so he was an actor.
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:25.640]   And he, so he was an actor, probably best known
[00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:28.840]   for being on Sons of Anarchy on FX.
[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:30.240]   - The main character?
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.520]   - I don't know the show.
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:32.440]   - I've seen the show.
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:33.760]   I've seen the whole show.
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:36.320]   - Yeah, he's like a lantern jod.
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:37.400]   - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:38.240]   - You know what I'm saying?
[00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:39.160]   - Yeah, he's, yeah, I know.
[00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:40.720]   - Okay, so he's like a big character in that.
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:42.960]   Anyways, but he grew up on a ranch, right?
[00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:46.440]   Like he came out of, and he owns a ranch,
[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:47.800]   come up out of a ranch.
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:50.760]   In his, so after the age of 40,
[00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:52.640]   he said, "I'm gonna screenwrite."
[00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:54.840]   And he was gonna do neo-westerns,
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:57.880]   which is like the new type of western.
[00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:01.400]   I think the Coen brothers kind of helped usher this in
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:02.600]   with No Country for Old Men.
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:06.880]   So neo-westerns, they take place in our modern world.
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:09.120]   And some of the issues are not,
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:11.960]   there's like a bandit coming to town.
[00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:15.360]   It's like the economic hardships of whatever.
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:16.360]   And so he's like, "Great, I'm just gonna like
[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:17.520]   "start writing these type of things."
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:22.520]   And he wrote Sicario, Hell and High Water,
[00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:24.840]   and then Wind River, just like rattled off
[00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:28.200]   these like great movies, started writing in his 40s.
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:32.840]   His second movie was Oscar nominated for best screenplay.
[00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:34.640]   Wind River, he directed,
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:36.680]   like just kind of came out of nowhere.
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:39.160]   He just had such a clear vision.
[00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:41.400]   And then he did the show Yellowstone,
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:44.280]   which has become a huge phenomenon.
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:45.680]   So then he did the show Yellowstone,
[00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:46.760]   and then there's a spinoff,
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:48.040]   and they're doing another spinoff.
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:50.440]   And he's part of, I don't know if we talked about this
[00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:53.400]   on the show, but in Yellowstone,
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:54.840]   there's this huge ranch in Texas,
[00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:57.960]   a real ranch called the 6666, four sixes.
[00:15:57.960 --> 00:15:59.120]   And it's huge.
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:02.960]   I think it's over a hundred thousand acres.
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:05.080]   It's like six times the size of Chicago.
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:07.760]   And he's part of a group that just bought it.
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:10.120]   And they have a spinoff of the show
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:12.040]   that like takes place on that ranch.
[00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:14.200]   And he's like a horse wrangler.
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:16.360]   So like often in this show, Yellowstone,
[00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:17.880]   he's a character in the show,
[00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:20.200]   and he's always just doing crazy things on horses.
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:22.800]   And all the horses in the show are his horses.
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:25.160]   Anyways, he started all that after 40
[00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:27.000]   and just sort of redefined the genre.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.640]   So you never know.
[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:30.800]   What I'm saying is I think we need a ranch.
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:33.040]   (laughing)
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:35.640]   We should broadcast from a ranch.
[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:38.800]   Yeah, it would be episode one,
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:40.320]   but guys, I'm reporting from my ranch.
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:42.520]   Episode two, you'd be like, it would be you.
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:44.400]   He'd be like, I have sad news.
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:47.120]   - Cal's 40 miles in the other direction on a horse
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.320]   in his cabin writing some poetry.
[00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:51.880]   - No, I was gonna say more, Cal has been killed.
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:54.280]   He has been trampled by,
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:58.520]   trampled by his snake bitten body was trampled by horses
[00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:00.560]   and then dragged by cattle through barbed wire
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:01.800]   because he has no idea what he's doing.
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:03.240]   And also the ranch is on fire.
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:05.600]   That's what would happen.
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:08.080]   Yes, I worry about that stuff.
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:09.880]   I don't know if I worry about it, I think about it.
[00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:11.320]   And I never thought about that before
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:14.040]   until I realized I was gonna turn 40 this year.
[00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:14.880]   - Interesting.
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:18.240]   - Yeah, and then I was like, oh my God, I guess this is like
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:20.400]   I'm no longer like the hungry upstart thinking like,
[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:22.040]   what's the thing I'm gonna do?
[00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:23.120]   Where am I gonna break out?
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:25.280]   But also I'm pretty happy with where I am.
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:29.960]   So it's not bad, but it's definitely an adjustment.
[00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:32.840]   - You want another question?
[00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:34.240]   - Yeah, let's do one more.
[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:35.680]   - All right, final question.
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:38.560]   You talk a lot about training like an athlete.
[00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:41.160]   Are there any athletes that you closely follow
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:43.960]   that you like that resonate with you?
[00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:46.840]   Based on like their training resume
[00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:49.120]   and like what they do, what they're all about?
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:50.360]   - Well, our man Scherzer.
[00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:53.320]   You know a little bit of something
[00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:54.360]   about his training regime, right?
[00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:56.640]   But he's a beast, right?
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:58.840]   - Yeah, absolutely, obsessed.
[00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:01.920]   - Yeah, he was obsessed
[00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:04.800]   and was able to keep his career going.
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:07.360]   I mean, the deal he just signed with the Mets,
[00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:08.360]   he's old, man.
[00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:09.200]   - I know.
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:10.720]   - He's younger than us, but he's old.
[00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:13.280]   That's a big deal, that's a lot of money.
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:15.680]   Yeah, that's all training and competitive.
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:17.280]   That's competitive fire right there.
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:20.560]   Just that like lasers, yeah.
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:23.720]   So I like that, I follow him.
[00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:28.600]   I like the thing, I'm like the Max Scherzer of,
[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:30.200]   I have to go incredibly narrow here.
[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:32.680]   I'm like the Max Scherzer of podcasts
[00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:34.720]   that are in a Q&A format
[00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:36.720]   and that deal mainly with questions
[00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:38.720]   about like work and productivity
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:41.800]   and are taped in Maryland.
[00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:43.520]   I'm like the Max Scherzer of that.
[00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:47.520]   All right. - Take it.
[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:48.360]   - All right, so there we go.
[00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:49.640]   So this is a listener calls thing.
[00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:50.960]   I think, thanks for the questions, Jesse.
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:52.000]   So there you go, a little insight
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.600]   into what's going on in my life.
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:55.960]   I think it was useful.
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:57.480]   If you have questions you want Jesse to ask me,
[00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:59.760]   you can send them to jesse@calnewport.com.
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:00.880]   This is a listener calls episode.
[00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:02.120]   We have some listener calls,
[00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:05.320]   but we have to first pay the bills.
[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:08.080]   Those type of ranches that we are going to buy imminently
[00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:09.480]   don't pay for themselves.
[00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:12.320]   So let's talk about a couple of sponsors.
[00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:16.640]   I want to talk first about MyBodyTutor.
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:18.360]   All right, now Jesse,
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:20.840]   you've heard me talk about this before,
[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:23.520]   and maybe this would be a good model for us
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:25.360]   for actually like productivity tutoring or something,
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:27.040]   because like what they're doing here is pretty smart.
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:32.000]   It's fitness and health online coaching.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.240]   You get a coach, they come up with a plan for you,
[00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:37.160]   what you're eating, how you're exercising,
[00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:38.960]   and you talk to them every day.
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:40.760]   You check in, here's how it's going.
[00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:43.000]   And they get back to you every single day,
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.680]   like, "Hey, good work," or, "Focus on this,"
[00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:45.520]   or, "Worry about this."
[00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:46.480]   "Oh, you had a question about this.
[00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:47.480]   Let me give you some answers to it."
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:52.400]   So you have the consistency of a coach with the convenience
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.600]   and the economic efficiency of that coach
[00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:55.840]   being entirely online.
[00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:57.960]   I think this is a really good idea.
[00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:00.080]   And it gives you something to do.
[00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:01.200]   If you're like, "I want to get in better shape.
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:02.480]   I want to get my health together.
[00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:03.880]   I don't want to just randomly go at it."
[00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:06.880]   Sign up for MyBodyTutor, get one of these tutors.
[00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:08.920]   I mean, we could do this, Jesse.
[00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:12.600]   We should do this with MyWorkTutor
[00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:14.160]   or something like that.
[00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:17.280]   And you would check in online with me, right?
[00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:18.560]   Every day, you fill out a survey
[00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:20.360]   about all the work you would do.
[00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:22.400]   And I would leave a voice message
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:25.080]   in which I would just say, "Work deeper."
[00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:27.960]   - And you need another job.
[00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:30.320]   - The issue is I don't have enough to do.
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:31.440]   So I'm going to tell Adam Gilbert,
[00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:32.440]   who I've known for a long time,
[00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:34.160]   who runs MyBodyTutor,
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:35.240]   I'm going to tell Adam Gilbert,
[00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:38.760]   you need to add a deep work tutoring service
[00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:40.680]   that's just me saying, "Work deeper,"
[00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:43.040]   and add that to your offerings.
[00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:44.480]   So here's the deal with MyBodyTutor.
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:47.840]   If you go to mybodytutor.com,
[00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:50.760]   that's T-U-T-O-R,
[00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:53.080]   and you tell them that you came from Deep Questions,
[00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:53.920]   and you could just,
[00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:56.440]   Adam looks at every single person who comes in.
[00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:59.680]   I mean, he gives you his personal phone number,
[00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:01.040]   cell phone number when you sign up.
[00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:05.560]   So this is not some anonymous Peloton type nonsense.
[00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:06.720]   This is personal.
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:08.680]   If you tell him, "Hey, I came from Deep Questions,"
[00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:11.760]   he will give you $50 off your first month.
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:14.120]   So that's mybodytutor.com,
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:15.080]   mention Deep Questions,
[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:17.320]   and get $50 off.
[00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:19.240]   All right, so Jesse,
[00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:21.440]   as long as we are getting our listeners
[00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:22.720]   in the fantastic shape
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:25.120]   so that we can recruit them to come work on our ranch
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:27.080]   and save me from being trampled,
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:28.760]   let's talk about Athletic Greens.
[00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:31.600]   Athletic Greens is a,
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:35.480]   it's a powder that includes 75 high-quality vitamins,
[00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:38.760]   minerals, whole food source, superfoods, probiotics,
[00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:43.240]   and the thing I'm always bothering Jesse about, adaptogens.
[00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:46.560]   I'm always like, "Hey man, how's your adaptogens going?"
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:49.720]   You got all the stuff you need in a powder.
[00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:50.600]   You take it once a day,
[00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:52.280]   you put it in 12 ounces of water.
[00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:54.640]   I add two ice cubes 'cause I like it cold.
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:56.280]   Shake it up, drink it once a day.
[00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:59.280]   The reason why I take Athletic Greens
[00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:03.680]   is because it is all they do is this one product.
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:06.960]   They say we again and again relentlessly
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:08.640]   keep upgrading this one product
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:11.520]   to have the very best sourced materials in it.
[00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:14.360]   The whole point is that you don't have to worry,
[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:16.760]   am I getting the right stuff?
[00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:18.880]   Am I getting the best stuff?
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:22.400]   I've talked to Athletic Greens directly.
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:23.840]   They walk me through how this whole works.
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:24.680]   I trust them.
[00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:25.760]   I literally use it every day.
[00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:27.280]   It's a powder.
[00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:28.520]   And the only thing that's not in the powder
[00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:30.160]   is the vitamin D because it's not,
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:32.120]   again, they obsess about what's gonna work.
[00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:34.200]   Vitamin D doesn't work well in powder form.
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:36.040]   So you add a couple of drops to it for the vitamin D.
[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:37.800]   And I take it every morning
[00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:39.400]   'cause I don't wanna have to worry.
[00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:41.560]   Am I having enough of this nutrient?
[00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:43.160]   Do I have enough of this vitamin?
[00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:44.080]   Take the Athletic Greens.
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:45.160]   They also have travel packs,
[00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:46.320]   which is great when you travel.
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:47.400]   So it's one serving.
[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:50.160]   Wherever you are, you just throw it into some,
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:52.880]   you throw it into some water.
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:55.520]   So I am fans of Athletic Greens.
[00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:56.560]   They're not just a sponsor.
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:59.040]   I actually use it.
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:01.880]   Your adaptogens okay, Jesse?
[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:02.840]   I was worried about you today.
[00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:03.680]   - They're deep.
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:04.520]   - Yeah, are they deep?
[00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:05.520]   'Cause I was like,
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:07.600]   you look like you're adaptogen deprived.
[00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:09.120]   I'm not sure about this.
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:10.400]   I'm worried about it.
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:12.040]   I'm gonna bring some Athletic Greens in the studio
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:14.640]   and force you to take some before every episode
[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:16.400]   so that you're on top of your game.
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:19.040]   So let me give you a call to action here.
[00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:21.200]   Right now it's time to reclaim your health
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:24.320]   and arm your immune system with convenient daily nutrition,
[00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:28.160]   especially heading into flu and cold season.
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:30.000]   Yes, trust me, we're there.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:30.960]   I have three kids.
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:32.040]   I know all about this.
[00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:34.760]   It's just one scoop and a cup of water every day.
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:35.600]   That's it.
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:37.680]   No need for a million different pills and supplements
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:39.880]   to look out for your health.
[00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:41.160]   Jesse, I would say the reason why you need
[00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:42.440]   to take Athletic Greens, by the way,
[00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:44.280]   is that if you ever got near my family,
[00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:46.800]   I have three young kids that are just germ factories.
[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:48.360]   You're not around kids a lot.
[00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:50.240]   I think you would quite literally just die.
[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:51.240]   (Jesse laughs)
[00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:52.600]   Like if they came in here right now,
[00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:53.720]   you'd be like, "Oh, it's nice to meet you."
[00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:55.400]   And then you would just die.
[00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:57.400]   Just your immune system would be like,
[00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:58.520]   forget COVID, man.
[00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:01.320]   Like these kids are swarming in germs.
[00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:02.200]   This is why I gotta take Athletic Greens.
[00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:04.360]   I take it every single day because man,
[00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:08.640]   my immune system is at war every day in the winter.
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:09.520]   So to make it easy,
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:13.760]   Athletic Greens is going to give you free one year supply
[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:15.280]   of immune supporting vitamin D
[00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:18.600]   and five free travel packs with your first purchase.
[00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:22.840]   All you have to do is visit athleticgreens.com/deep.
[00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:28.000]   Again, that is athleticgreens.com/deep
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.520]   to take ownership over your health
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:33.720]   and pick up the ultimate daily nutritional insurance.
[00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:38.440]   All right, Jesse, let's do some calls.
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:41.900]   Who do we have on the old call docket today?
[00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:44.320]   - Okay, our first call is from Mark.
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:46.640]   He's like you, he's a professor in DC.
[00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:51.480]   And he has a question about finding the opposing views
[00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:53.840]   when you're dealing with certain topics.
[00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:57.680]   - Hi, Kel, my name is Mark
[00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:01.640]   and I'm also a professor at an R1 university in the DC area.
[00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:03.240]   My question for you is the following.
[00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:05.440]   Often on your show, you'll discuss this idea
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:08.160]   of building up the Socratic dialectic, as you call it,
[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:12.480]   or finding the best thinkers or writers or speakers
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:15.440]   from opposing viewpoints on a given topic.
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:16.880]   My question is the following.
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:19.200]   If you want to explore a given topic,
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:21.880]   but perhaps you're not as familiar with the topic
[00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:24.240]   enough to kind of know who the key thinkers
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:25.600]   are on that topic,
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:28.000]   how would you go about the specific mechanics
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.040]   of identifying who the best speakers were
[00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:32.920]   for that specific topic?
[00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:35.360]   For example, let's say I wanted to understand
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:36.920]   the causes of the Baltic War.
[00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:40.160]   It's not a topic I'm typically familiar with.
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:43.200]   How would I go about finding the two or three
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:44.880]   best thinkers or speakers on that,
[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:48.320]   given that I have no knowledge of that area?
[00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:50.640]   So this is sort of the curse of knowledge situation,
[00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:53.120]   where if I know who the best thinkers are,
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:55.320]   I'm probably already knowledgeable enough
[00:25:55.320 --> 00:26:00.160]   about the field to understand what the key points are.
[00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:02.440]   But if I'm just entering something for the first time,
[00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:06.960]   it's actually quite difficult to do what you're describing.
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:08.880]   Thank you for your time.
[00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:10.080]   - Good question, Mark.
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:13.880]   Let me start by just underlining the bigger picture method
[00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:16.560]   that Mark was talking about here.
[00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:18.560]   So it's one of the big points I've been making
[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:20.600]   on this show since the beginning,
[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:23.680]   is when it comes to having an interesting,
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:26.040]   thriving, resilient, but also authentic
[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:29.400]   and value-producing intellectual life,
[00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:31.560]   you have to be very worried about
[00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:34.640]   or wary of intellectual groupism.
[00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:36.040]   And this is where you say,
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:40.720]   I just wanna be told what I'm supposed to think
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:42.920]   about something, who the good guys are
[00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:44.920]   and who the bad guys are.
[00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:48.880]   Your mind knows that you are being subservient
[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:51.440]   when you do that, and it's not happy with yourself.
[00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:54.360]   It's not a approach to intellectual life
[00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:55.360]   that is sustainable.
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:57.120]   It makes you feel bad about yourself.
[00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:59.480]   And it brings you into weird tribal places.
[00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:01.520]   It's also, by the way, the dominant mode
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:03.520]   of intellectual discourse on social media.
[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:08.480]   So beware if you are wandering through the waters of Twitter,
[00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:10.840]   you're wandering through the waters of,
[00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:12.840]   I don't know what people use these days, Instagram.
[00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:16.040]   So my alternative, and by my, I mean this goes back
[00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:19.200]   to the very early days of systematic thinking
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:21.800]   about thinking, is the Socratic dialectic method.
[00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:24.000]   If you wanna understand something better,
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.280]   listen to really good thinkers on multiple sides of it.
[00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:28.920]   In that collision, you see what resonates,
[00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:30.960]   you get more insight, you get a more nuanced,
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:32.560]   rooted understanding of that topic,
[00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:34.600]   one that you can actually base real action on
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:36.560]   and feel good about it.
[00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:39.880]   If by contrast, you just do intellectual groupism,
[00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:42.640]   your mind often is not gonna really trust your stance
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:44.320]   because you know you're just following a crowd.
[00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:46.640]   So it's not a good foundation for action.
[00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:49.440]   You don't feel confident taking action,
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:51.400]   real action based off it.
[00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:54.440]   So then you end up just doing very little about a cause,
[00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:57.120]   maybe like tweeting about it or yelling at people,
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:59.720]   or like getting mad at your cousin or something like this,
[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:01.000]   and nothing really happened.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.480]   So there's this irony of intellectual groupism
[00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:06.920]   is that often people think this is the key
[00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:07.880]   to changing the world.
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:10.400]   If we could just get people to just be on our side
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:12.280]   and don't question it and attack the other side,
[00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:13.400]   then we'll change this issue.
[00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:15.800]   But actually what you do is you defang people's
[00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:18.560]   actual activist impulses and very little action is taken
[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:21.200]   because they don't trust the intellectual foundation
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:22.040]   of what they believe.
[00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:24.080]   They just vaguely think you're on their team
[00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:25.400]   and don't wanna get yelled at.
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:30.160]   So encounter real argument, real argument on both sides.
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:31.400]   You will not be tricked.
[00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:34.440]   Your deep moral intuitions will not be tricked
[00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:38.520]   because you read a particularly clever National Review
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:39.760]   or Mother Jones article.
[00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:40.920]   It's not gonna trick you.
[00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:43.000]   It's gonna make your belief stronger and more nuanced.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.640]   It's actually gonna make you a better advocate
[00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:46.560]   for what you believe in.
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:47.840]   So how do you find these things?
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:51.360]   Well, for really specific issues like the Baltic War,
[00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:54.080]   you know, something that's kinda niche,
[00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:56.480]   you don't have to find from scratch the best thinker.
[00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:58.320]   You just have to find someone who knows about it
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:28:59.960]   and ask them who the best thinker is.
[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:02.200]   That's almost always the right way to do it.
[00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:04.680]   Like, oh, here's a professor who wrote an article
[00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:06.000]   about the Baltic War.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.120]   That's why I'm thinking about it.
[00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:08.160]   I read this article.
[00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:09.640]   Let me talk to this person.
[00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:12.760]   Like, hey, what are like the definitive books on this?
[00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:14.040]   Who are the definitive thinkers on it?
[00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:15.200]   What are the different sides of this?
[00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:18.640]   You can do that for almost any topic.
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:22.000]   Find someone who knows about the topic
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.480]   and then ask them who they think the best thinkers are.
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:28.760]   Now, if there's already a clear tribal divide on the topic,
[00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:30.560]   just find a reasonable person
[00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:33.280]   who seems to be roughly speaking on one side.
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:34.920]   Find a reasonable person who, roughly speaking,
[00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:36.280]   seems to be on the other side.
[00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:39.520]   And say, what are the best articles or books
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:41.000]   about this topic?
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.200]   Then you're going to get those two opposing viewpoints.
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:44.880]   You read them both, let them collide.
[00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:48.360]   You are going to have the more nuanced understanding.
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:50.080]   All right, so Mark, I appreciate the question
[00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:51.640]   because it gives me a chance
[00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:54.240]   to go back to that general thinking.
[00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:58.160]   There's actually a name I heard for that approach
[00:29:58.160 --> 00:29:59.120]   to intellectual life,
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:01.600]   especially like culturally relevant intellectual life.
[00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:06.080]   It was a name that was coined by a former doctor
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:11.000]   who is now a full-time podcaster YouTuber
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.280]   who talks about medical issues.
[00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:14.840]   And he goes by,
[00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:18.200]   and this name is not going to make you feel better
[00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:19.720]   about what I'm about to tell you here,
[00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:23.880]   but he goes by the name ZDogg with two Gs, MD.
[00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:27.400]   That's how you can find him on YouTube, ZDoggMD.
[00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:30.680]   I don't know what his actual real name is.
[00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:33.000]   Really funny guy, really smart guy,
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.400]   really funny broadcaster.
[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:37.840]   But he coined this term alt-middle.
[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:40.920]   And I kind of like this terminology, right?
[00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:43.080]   So alt-middle is basically an approach
[00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:48.080]   where instead of partaking in intellectual groupism,
[00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:50.160]   where you say, where's my tribe?
[00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:51.040]   What do we believe?
[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:52.040]   Send me the memo.
[00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:54.280]   Great, who can I tweet at?
[00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:56.520]   You approach topics one by one and say,
[00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:57.360]   let me get into this,
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:59.600]   if it's interesting or relevant to me and I have the time.
[00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:02.560]   Let me look at people on both sides of it
[00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:04.840]   and come up with my own take on it.
[00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:06.280]   And then, and this is critical,
[00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:07.520]   be willing to change that take
[00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:09.640]   if I get better information down the line.
[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:12.600]   That hold that position with some empathy
[00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:14.400]   and with some contingency.
[00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:16.240]   I might not quite be right here.
[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:18.000]   This is a complicated topic.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.360]   And so I'm going to hold that with some contingency
[00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:22.000]   and I'm going to be relatively empathetic
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:22.960]   to people on other sides.
[00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:24.280]   Other people aren't evil.
[00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:26.800]   And that is what he calls the alt-middle approach.
[00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:29.640]   It really emerged because he's a doctor.
[00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:33.480]   He does a lot of sort of COVID centrist type communication.
[00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:34.760]   He's sort of a COVID centrist.
[00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:37.280]   So one of these people that's very plugged in
[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:40.560]   and mainstream on COVID and understands the science,
[00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:43.640]   but also is alarmed by both sides.
[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:45.080]   Alarmed, for example,
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:49.840]   by really extreme anti-vaccination type of discussion.
[00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:52.440]   Also alarmed by really extreme,
[00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:53.720]   we need to lock down the kids
[00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:55.040]   and put them in underwater cages
[00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:56.960]   because there's a guy who lives six states over
[00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:59.200]   who was once immunocompromised type thinking.
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:02.880]   And so through COVID centrism, he has evolved this idea,
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:05.120]   but I think it could apply to all of intellectual life.
[00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:06.080]   Alt-middle.
[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:08.160]   So ZDogg, I appreciate that terminology.
[00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:10.360]   Mark, I appreciate you bringing this up.
[00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:13.360]   Find people who seem reasonable, ask them who the best is,
[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:16.640]   read on both sides of the topic, think for yourself,
[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:19.120]   hold ideas with some contingencies,
[00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:20.920]   be empathetic to the other side
[00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:23.200]   and trust your moral intuitions.
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:26.960]   You're not going to be tricked into believing something bad.
[00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:29.600]   Your views are going to get more nuanced.
[00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:31.400]   Your beliefs are going to get stronger.
[00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:34.040]   Your ability and motivation to actually make change
[00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:36.640]   in the world, which is what actually matters,
[00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:38.760]   is actually going to be improved
[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:40.480]   when you encounter the very best thinkers
[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:43.080]   on all sides of an issue.
[00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:45.680]   All right, so thanks, Mark.
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:48.840]   Jesse, I showed you ZDogg's.
[00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:49.680]   - Yeah.
[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:50.520]   - I showed you one of his videos.
[00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:52.760]   I guess his studio looks very nice.
[00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:53.600]   I'm jealous.
[00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:55.760]   So what is it that makes it look nice?
[00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:59.560]   - It's like a lighting, but I don't know,
[00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:03.160]   it's like a big studio and it's in soft focus or something.
[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:05.040]   - Yeah, it kind of looks like a really nice yoga studio.
[00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:07.480]   - Yeah, and I don't know if he has like a nice camera.
[00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:08.320]   I mean, pretty nice cameras,
[00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:09.400]   maybe he has an even nicer camera,
[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:11.080]   but they're good looking videos.
[00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:12.600]   He's also a funny guy.
[00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:13.440]   I like him.
[00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:14.280]   ZDoggMD.
[00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:18.680]   That's such a like, the first name I came up with
[00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:20.680]   when I, I bet if we asked him, he's like,
[00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:23.000]   "I signed up for YouTube on a whim 20 years ago."
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.480]   And it was like the first name that came to mind
[00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:25.920]   and then you're stuck with it.
[00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:28.960]   It's like when you end up with like your email address
[00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:33.960]   is like nsyncfan24@aol.com.
[00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:36.180]   And you're kind of stuck with it
[00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:37.480]   because like all your family,
[00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:39.600]   that's the one they know to use.
[00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:41.640]   I wonder if that's where ZDogg came from.
[00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:44.340]   All right, what do we got next?
[00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:47.160]   - All right, the next question's from Drew.
[00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:50.040]   He's in a gap year and he has a question
[00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:52.080]   on what activities he should pursue.
[00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:55.280]   - Hey, Kyle, loving the show.
[00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:56.680]   I'm Drew from the Philippines
[00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:59.480]   and I'm currently in a gap year before college.
[00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:02.000]   I've applied to elite universities in the US
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.880]   and I'm pretty confident I'll get into at least one of them,
[00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:07.080]   hopefully, but in the meantime,
[00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:10.000]   I'm trying to make the most of my time during my gap year.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.680]   My country is still in the dying thralls of the pandemic
[00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:15.400]   so going outside is still a bit restricted.
[00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:17.400]   So I've started developing a lifelong habit
[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:19.840]   of reading books at a more frequent level,
[00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:23.120]   averaging at least one or two nonfiction books per week
[00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:26.440]   by employing your method of making it a default activity.
[00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:28.840]   And it's been working effortlessly so far.
[00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:31.880]   I have approximately 10 months before college
[00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:33.440]   and by the end of my gap year,
[00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:36.360]   I want to come out of it becoming the best possible version
[00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:39.640]   that a 19-year-old like me is capable of actualizing.
[00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:41.760]   What activities should I pursue
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:44.880]   and what kind of mindset should I employ going forward?
[00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:45.720]   Thanks, Kyle.
[00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:52.280]   - So given that you're somewhat physically stuck,
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:55.080]   that's gonna change the way we think about this gap year
[00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:59.320]   because often gap years is built around experiences.
[00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:01.560]   You go to interesting places, you meet interesting people,
[00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:02.680]   which I think is really important,
[00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:04.800]   but now you're gonna be limited there.
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:06.200]   I think what I'm gonna advise
[00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:09.560]   is that you actually develop a curriculum.
[00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:12.600]   So instead of just, which by the way is great,
[00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:15.880]   but instead of just encountering and reading a lot of books,
[00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:20.880]   let's have a curriculum that has maybe three goals
[00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:24.480]   that you're gonna make consistent effort towards.
[00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:27.960]   So you might have a curriculum for reading.
[00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:30.680]   I'm trying to get through these particular books
[00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:32.680]   and I'm gonna read these secondary sources
[00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:33.600]   about each of these books
[00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:36.680]   to try to fill in a particular subject matter
[00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:38.480]   that I wanna know a lot about.
[00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:40.800]   And I don't care about the details so much here
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:45.320]   as it is just doing some sort of consistent intellectual work
[00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:47.720]   and intellectual exploration.
[00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:51.040]   I mean, for example, I'll give you an example from my life.
[00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:54.280]   When I first came down to Washington, DC
[00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:56.160]   to take a professorship at Georgetown,
[00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:57.320]   this is before we had kids,
[00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:59.520]   so I had a lot of free time on my hand.
[00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:01.280]   My wife worked a normal person job.
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:03.360]   Professorship's not a normal job.
[00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:05.240]   So she had to actually go to work for normal hours
[00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:07.880]   and I didn't, I was a first year professor.
[00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:09.520]   I did a self-imposed curriculum.
[00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:11.000]   I had come across this book,
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:14.800]   a book of philosophy called "All Things Shining."
[00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:16.360]   By Dreyfus and Kelly.
[00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:18.440]   And it was an interesting book that was,
[00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:20.040]   went back through the classics
[00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:22.280]   and extracted ideas from the classics
[00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:25.360]   about the sacred and finding meaning in life.
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:26.880]   We actually talked about this recently
[00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:28.600]   in my appearance on the Tim Ferriss podcast.
[00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:30.120]   I guess Tim tried to read it
[00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:32.760]   and he didn't actually like it much.
[00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:34.160]   And the reason Tim didn't like it is he said,
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:35.480]   "I didn't know all the references.
[00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:36.960]   "I hadn't read Aeschylus.
[00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:38.320]   "I hadn't read Dante."
[00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:40.400]   And so what I did, I said, "Here's what I'm gonna do.
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:41.760]   "I'm gonna use 'All Things Shining'
[00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:43.240]   "'cause it's talking about all these books
[00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:44.840]   "and drawing interesting lessons about them.
[00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:46.840]   "And as it gets to each of those books
[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:50.080]   "that it references, I'm gonna stop and read that."
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:52.760]   So I'm gonna go, you know, I started with "The Odyssey"
[00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:55.200]   because they started with the classical heroic Greeks.
[00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:57.560]   And I read "The Odyssey" and then I read Aeschylus
[00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:02.000]   and then I read Dante and I read Augustine.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   And so I followed this book and I would read the things
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:08.160]   and then read them, talk about it,
[00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:09.720]   then read the next things and read what they talked about.
[00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:11.120]   And it was like an organized curriculum
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:12.520]   and it was actually really interesting
[00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:13.360]   to go through these.
[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:15.120]   And the book ended up with David Foster Wallace.
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:17.760]   So we went from Homer to David Foster Wallace.
[00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:21.280]   And there was an organized reflection here
[00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:23.000]   as the book went on.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:23.960]   So do something like that.
[00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:25.200]   Just to get in the habit of,
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:27.440]   I can on myself autonomously
[00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:30.080]   dive into an intellectual pool
[00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:32.400]   and make sense of it just because I want to.
[00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:34.760]   And there's a lot of different topics you can do this on.
[00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:35.920]   If you wanna steer this,
[00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:39.080]   you might consider subscribing to the great courses
[00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:41.120]   and let one of the great courses,
[00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:42.720]   you pick a topic from there and let that course
[00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:44.480]   actually watch the lectures and then read the books.
[00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:45.840]   Like actually follow a great course
[00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:47.720]   if you want a little bit more structure.
[00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:48.900]   So that should be part of your curriculum,
[00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:51.920]   some sort of focused intellectual exploration
[00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:53.080]   where you learn to just love doing
[00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:54.760]   focused intellectual explorations.
[00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:57.600]   The second thing in your curriculum
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:59.960]   should have you building or creating something.
[00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:03.440]   And I don't know if it's physical,
[00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:05.600]   if it's digital, if it's written, if it's code,
[00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:07.680]   but it's just you're building and honing a skill
[00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:10.920]   and creating things, making intentions manifest concretely
[00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:12.800]   in the world, just to get in the habit
[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:15.680]   while you have the time of developing a skill
[00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:18.120]   and creating things, being able to actually add new things
[00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:20.680]   into the world, I think that's quite fulfilling.
[00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:22.120]   And then the third part of the curriculum,
[00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:24.400]   I would add is something physical.
[00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:27.200]   Get in really good shape.
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:29.600]   Not that you need to be in really good shape
[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:31.360]   to go to college in America,
[00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:35.440]   but just that it's an outlet for the energy,
[00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:37.680]   it will calm intellectual anxieties
[00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:40.160]   and it's self-mastery and efficacy.
[00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:42.080]   I'm the type of guy that can structure my time
[00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:43.680]   and get after it, I'm getting in really good shape.
[00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:46.120]   It just makes you feel like you have control
[00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:48.800]   over your own life so that when you get there,
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:52.560]   when you get to college, you have all this confidence.
[00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:54.400]   I can control my life and create something here
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:56.440]   that's really interesting.
[00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:58.960]   And I'm not at just the whims of,
[00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:00.760]   oh my God, my classes and I'm stressed
[00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:01.880]   and I'm just up drinking all night.
[00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:03.160]   Like you feel like you're actually in control.
[00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:04.440]   So I would do those three things.
[00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:06.640]   That's my three-part curriculum I would suggest
[00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:10.960]   for your semi-homebound gap year.
[00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:11.800]   The fourth thing I'm gonna say,
[00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:12.800]   which is not part of the curriculum,
[00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:14.920]   but this is just a substrate.
[00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:17.240]   You need to socialize and connect as much
[00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:20.680]   as the Philippine pandemic restrictions allow.
[00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:21.840]   You need to connect to other people.
[00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:23.640]   You need to sacrifice on behalf of other people.
[00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:25.480]   You need to be a leader in your community
[00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:26.720]   and among people you know.
[00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:27.840]   That's just gonna be the foundation
[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:30.000]   that stops you from going crazy.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.080]   If you're allowed to see people outside,
[00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:32.520]   see people outside.
[00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:33.480]   You're not allowed to do that,
[00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:36.960]   then do it virtually until you can.
[00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:38.160]   But as soon as you can do that,
[00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:39.680]   like be around people, see people,
[00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:40.960]   communicate with people, help people,
[00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:42.960]   bring stuff to people who need help.
[00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:46.840]   Make the social aspect of your life really amplified.
[00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:48.760]   And this is not about your gap year.
[00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:50.560]   This is about you're going through a period
[00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:53.160]   of pandemic restrictions that we all went through before.
[00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:56.080]   And it's the thing that you have to push over the top
[00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:58.720]   to counteract the isolating negative impacts
[00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:02.040]   of pandemic restrictions.
[00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:05.280]   And so I just want you to see that as medicine.
[00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:06.760]   That is your, I don't wanna get anxious
[00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:09.800]   and depressed medicine for this very specific circumstance.
[00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:12.880]   It is, I'm gonna become more socially engaged
[00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:14.360]   and sacrifice more time and attention
[00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:16.560]   on behalf of other people than I ever have before in my life.
[00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:18.000]   And that's just your daily medicine.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.040]   All right?
[00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:24.040]   So Drew, hopefully things will calm down there soon.
[00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:26.600]   Hopefully you'll find your way to a nice school soon
[00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:27.440]   and really enjoy that.
[00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:30.920]   But in the meantime, that is my prescription.
[00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:33.840]   - It's kind of weird, Jesse, to imagine there's still,
[00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:34.680]   I mean, I guess it's true,
[00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:36.960]   but there's places where you're dealing
[00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:40.160]   with lockdown type things.
[00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:41.000]   - Yeah.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:41.840]   - Yeah.
[00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:44.440]   I mean, I think we've been done with those here for a while.
[00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:47.200]   I think the populace basically just said,
[00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:49.360]   you gotta find a better way.
[00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:50.200]   You gotta find a better way.
[00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:51.280]   Though, I don't know where we live.
[00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:53.080]   You see it every time you come here,
[00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:54.440]   compared to where you live.
[00:40:54.440 --> 00:41:00.200]   Montgomery County, Maryland is not exactly chill,
[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:02.160]   chilled out about the virus.
[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:03.000]   - Yeah.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:04.040]   I mean, I'm in Virginia,
[00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:05.920]   but it's only seven miles away.
[00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:07.280]   It's different.
[00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:08.120]   - Yeah.
[00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:10.160]   Interesting times, but hey, we can go outside.
[00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:11.920]   So feel bad for Drew.
[00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:14.720]   - When you were doing that All Things Shining project,
[00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:16.000]   how long did it take you to do all the,
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.640]   read all the books and everything?
[00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:20.560]   - I don't remember.
[00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:22.920]   Semester, maybe?
[00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:23.760]   More?
[00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:24.840]   I mean, I don't know if I read every one.
[00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:26.080]   Maybe I skipped a couple.
[00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:28.080]   But I just remember doing it
[00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:29.640]   for a lot of that academic year.
[00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:31.360]   And then I do other things,
[00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:32.760]   and I would come back to it.
[00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:34.960]   Yeah, it's vague memory,
[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:36.120]   but I have all those books still.
[00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:36.960]   And I remember, by the way,
[00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:39.640]   I remember so much from that,
[00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:41.480]   that it was very useful.
[00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:43.280]   Like I have all these references now,
[00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:44.880]   and these understandings of all these different books.
[00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:46.000]   I know these cultural references
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:47.400]   was actually a pretty cool,
[00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:48.760]   it was a pretty cool experience, actually.
[00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:50.720]   That's what I should have told Tim on the podcast.
[00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:52.320]   So Tim was saying he tried to read it,
[00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:54.480]   but found it really academic.
[00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:57.400]   Which it kind of is, if you haven't read the books.
[00:41:57.400 --> 00:41:59.200]   You're like, what the hell are they talking about?
[00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:01.320]   So I probably should have suggested to Tim,
[00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:03.520]   go back and try the book again,
[00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:07.640]   but read the books along with the writers.
[00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:11.240]   And so, longtime fans will recognize the reference,
[00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:13.840]   because I talk about it in "Deep Work."
[00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:17.920]   So that's where that original reference came back.
[00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:19.160]   All right, who do we got?
[00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:23.520]   - Next up, we have Shane McGrath.
[00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:26.040]   I'm pretty sure he's submitted a question before.
[00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:29.160]   And he's basically got a lot of jobs.
[00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:30.360]   He's doing a lot of juggling,
[00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:32.600]   and he's got a specific question about that.
[00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:37.240]   - Hi, Cal.
[00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:40.000]   My name is Shane, and I work as an operations analyst
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   in the medical device field.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.280]   I'm a big fan of your work,
[00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:45.520]   and credit the embrace of "Deep Work" principles
[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:48.280]   as a catalyst for my last two promotions.
[00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:49.480]   So I first and foremost,
[00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:52.200]   just want to express my utmost gratitude to your work,
[00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:55.240]   and I look forward to your future work as well.
[00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:57.720]   What I want to ask you is your advice and strategies
[00:42:57.720 --> 00:43:00.960]   for shifting gears between multiple domains.
[00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:03.240]   I have several interests, including writing,
[00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:06.520]   learning to code, investing, data analysis,
[00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:10.840]   cooking, and playing guitar, which I all tend to.
[00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:12.760]   They all feel rewarding in different ways,
[00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:15.040]   and I guess I just operate as a right-brained guy
[00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:17.640]   who loves to throw coals in the fire.
[00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:19.960]   Assuming I keep this juggling act going,
[00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:21.560]   do you have any tips or strategies
[00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:22.920]   that help to shift gears
[00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:25.760]   between work in different domains?
[00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:28.160]   When I write, it seems like the optimal state
[00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:30.800]   is quite different than when I'm coding in JavaScript,
[00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:31.760]   for example.
[00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:34.080]   They just seem to hit different.
[00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:36.000]   I just wonder how I could do a better job
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:39.080]   with managing this juggling act I'm in the middle of.
[00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:40.360]   Much appreciated, Cal.
[00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:41.200]   Thanks a lot.
[00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:44.680]   - Well, I mean, Shane, my advice here is
[00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:47.960]   if you're struggling juggling lots of balls,
[00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:52.320]   the best solution is to take out a bunch of the balls.
[00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:53.840]   That's much easier than trying to learn
[00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:54.840]   how do I juggle five balls.
[00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:56.200]   That's hard to do.
[00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:57.840]   Two balls is easier.
[00:43:57.840 --> 00:43:59.720]   So instead of trying to figure out how to juggle five balls,
[00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:00.720]   you could get rid of three,
[00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:03.120]   and that's what I think is the issue here.
[00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:04.240]   That's too many things.
[00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:06.520]   That's too many things.
[00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:09.240]   I think the overhead of having that many things
[00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:12.800]   is probably counterbalancing a lot of the value.
[00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:15.520]   So if we wanna see what's a more reasonable load,
[00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:16.360]   and we're talking here,
[00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:20.520]   these are all sort of out-of-work leisure-type pursuits,
[00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:21.720]   there's a few different things.
[00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:24.600]   If we're looking through the different deep life buckets,
[00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:25.680]   there's a few different things
[00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:27.880]   that are pulling at your time,
[00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:29.400]   especially outside of work.
[00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:31.000]   I mean, first of all, there's the community bucket.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.920]   I mean, serving your family, serving your friends,
[00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:35.560]   being a leader in your community,
[00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:38.280]   enjoying and savoring times with people you care about.
[00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:40.600]   Like, that actually needs a lot of time.
[00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:41.680]   That's a default.
[00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:43.880]   That's already taking up a lot of time.
[00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:45.720]   We have constitution.
[00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:47.000]   You gotta take care of your body.
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.920]   It's the best way also of keeping anxiety low,
[00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:51.240]   especially during difficult times,
[00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:53.240]   and it keeps you with more options
[00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:55.520]   for doing things with your life going forward.
[00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:56.600]   And that takes time.
[00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:59.520]   So now we don't have a ton of time left.
[00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:01.840]   Then you wanna throw in there,
[00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:03.440]   if we wanna have the celebration bucket
[00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:04.280]   or under contemplation,
[00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:06.120]   you wanna throw in there just having
[00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:08.160]   high-quality present leisure experiences,
[00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:09.520]   just really enjoying a movie,
[00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:10.760]   really enjoying a dinner,
[00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:12.800]   really enjoying a sunset while you're out for a walk,
[00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:15.560]   and that type of just present gratitude-generating moment.
[00:45:15.560 --> 00:45:16.680]   Now we're really getting down
[00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:18.800]   to a small amount of free time,
[00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:20.880]   which honestly, I think the right load there
[00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:24.080]   is there's a primary hobby that you work on over time,
[00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:25.880]   so you get the satisfaction of mastery
[00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:30.160]   and of developing a really refined taste in one area.
[00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:31.960]   So if you get really good at guitar,
[00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:34.600]   you don't just get the benefit of the mastery
[00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:35.440]   of playing your guitar well,
[00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:37.440]   you get the benefit of really being able to appreciate
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:39.280]   and understand other good guitar players.
[00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:40.880]   So it's a gift that keeps on giving.
[00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:42.520]   And then maybe have a secondary hobby
[00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:44.320]   that you're messing around with.
[00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:46.360]   I'm learning how to cook this season,
[00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:48.960]   and then I'm really busy and I'm doing no secondary thing.
[00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:50.080]   And then I'm messing around with code.
[00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:52.080]   I'm gonna make like a video game for my kids.
[00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:53.960]   And then I'm doing nothing because I'm busy.
[00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:55.480]   And you have that secondary slot.
[00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:58.280]   I honestly think that's really what people
[00:45:58.280 --> 00:45:59.520]   more or less have time for.
[00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:00.760]   And my worry is if you try to have
[00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:02.640]   five different leisure activities,
[00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:04.520]   those other core deep life areas,
[00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:06.720]   like community, like constitution,
[00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:08.080]   like just present celebration,
[00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:09.080]   they're gonna get squeezed out,
[00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:10.320]   and that's to your detriment.
[00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:12.080]   And the overhead of just switching back and forth
[00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:13.720]   between these things are gonna make you more anxious
[00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:15.440]   than you get benefit from them.
[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:17.440]   So I'm not sure if that's the answer you wanna hear,
[00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:20.040]   but that's the answer I am gonna give right now
[00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:24.040]   is if you do less, this might sound paradoxical,
[00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:26.880]   but if you do less, you're actually going to
[00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:30.600]   experience more good things in your life.
[00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:33.360]   All right, thanks Shane.
[00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:36.280]   All right, how are we doing here?
[00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:38.800]   How many total questions we're gonna try to do today?
[00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:41.400]   - We have two more questions,
[00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:42.480]   two or three more questions,
[00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:43.760]   depending on what you're feeling.
[00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:46.400]   - All right, well, let's do one more,
[00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:47.920]   and then we might check in with our sponsors
[00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:48.760]   and do another.
[00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:49.600]   - Okay.
[00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:52.840]   - So the next question is from,
[00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:55.640]   it's about lifestyle planning,
[00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:58.560]   and there's some struggles to stay disciplined.
[00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:01.800]   So we'll hear what it says.
[00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:06.760]   - Hi Cal, this is Ina, and besides being a homemaker,
[00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:08.680]   I learn languages autonomously
[00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:11.400]   and aspire to have my own language school.
[00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:14.440]   My question has to do with rituals and motivation.
[00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:17.680]   I have done life-centric career planning, as you recommend,
[00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:19.280]   and truly believe that at least
[00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:20.800]   for the current season of my life,
[00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:24.320]   I have chosen adequate goals towards the future I desire.
[00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:26.360]   Nevertheless, I find that some days
[00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:28.820]   I really do struggle to stay disciplined
[00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:31.600]   and to show up in the morning and get to work.
[00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:34.480]   Thinking back on advice you've given on this podcast,
[00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:37.120]   there are at least two ways I can approach this.
[00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:40.000]   One is to automate the process with a specific when,
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:41.600]   what, where, and how,
[00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:44.160]   so that I can let the power of habit take control,
[00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:47.660]   and the other is to seek a variety of awe-inspiring places
[00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:50.440]   to keep my brain interested and to jog my memory
[00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:53.880]   about why this work is important in the first place.
[00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:55.800]   Which of these options would you suggest
[00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:58.280]   for someone who still has to periodically
[00:47:58.280 --> 00:48:00.460]   drag herself to her desk?
[00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:02.600]   - That's a good question, Ina.
[00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:05.840]   So I think there's a few things that are relevant here,
[00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:07.520]   and you hit on some of them.
[00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:10.480]   So my answer is gonna overlap pretty strongly
[00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:12.120]   with what you were just saying.
[00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:13.520]   Automation is key,
[00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:16.000]   and automation can mean multiple different things
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:16.840]   in this context.
[00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:20.200]   So as you hinted, automation could just mean
[00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:22.580]   this is when, where, and how I do this work.
[00:48:22.580 --> 00:48:23.900]   So I don't even have to think about it.
[00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:25.580]   I get back from the gym,
[00:48:25.580 --> 00:48:28.700]   and then we have a desk put aside for bills.
[00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:33.000]   And that is when I do it, right after the gym on Wednesdays,
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:34.660]   and that's when I do the bills.
[00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:35.500]   And you know what?
[00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:37.100]   I always collect the bills from the mail
[00:48:37.100 --> 00:48:40.420]   and put them in a two-process sorter on that desk
[00:48:40.420 --> 00:48:41.660]   so I know where they are.
[00:48:41.660 --> 00:48:42.500]   And you know what?
[00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:44.460]   I have stamps there and the envelopes there,
[00:48:44.460 --> 00:48:46.080]   so it's real easy to do.
[00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:49.260]   There is an actual boost you get from organization
[00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:51.640]   where you say, "I built out a system for this."
[00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:54.580]   It's kind of fun to execute a system
[00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:56.600]   and see everything was here and it works really well,
[00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:58.340]   and then you're more likely to actually do the work.
[00:48:58.340 --> 00:49:00.140]   So you have that type of automation.
[00:49:00.140 --> 00:49:03.260]   The other type of automation is literally automating it.
[00:49:03.260 --> 00:49:05.540]   You're not gonna have someone else do this,
[00:49:05.540 --> 00:49:09.260]   especially when it comes to work, household admin work.
[00:49:09.260 --> 00:49:13.300]   I think Laura Vanderkam has a good book about this,
[00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:15.040]   "162 Hours."
[00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:16.940]   And she's a big advocate for this,
[00:49:16.940 --> 00:49:19.620]   of to the extent that you can afford it,
[00:49:19.620 --> 00:49:21.620]   this is where you should be putting a lot of your money
[00:49:21.620 --> 00:49:24.500]   is towards automating stuff in the house,
[00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:27.380]   getting household admin off of your plate.
[00:49:27.380 --> 00:49:28.740]   You have someone who does laundry,
[00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:29.940]   someone who does your yard work,
[00:49:29.940 --> 00:49:31.380]   the handyman who comes once a month,
[00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:32.580]   and you have this list that grows,
[00:49:32.580 --> 00:49:34.660]   and he just takes it and does those things around the house.
[00:49:34.660 --> 00:49:36.940]   And her point, which I think is a good one,
[00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:39.500]   is that is a super high return investment in money.
[00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:41.940]   And what happens instead is people often say,
[00:49:41.940 --> 00:49:43.620]   "Well, I technically could do these things,
[00:49:43.620 --> 00:49:46.000]   so I'd rather spend that money on, you know,
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.560]   something more fleeting or superficial."
[00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:50.200]   And it's actually what it got a lot more return
[00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:53.160]   in your life just to take those things off your plate.
[00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:56.040]   So literal automation, I think,
[00:49:56.040 --> 00:49:59.180]   is a priority to the extent that you could do it.
[00:49:59.180 --> 00:50:01.280]   The second thing to do here is reduction.
[00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:03.120]   So just taking things off your plate.
[00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:06.640]   Sometimes when you're not able to get started on things,
[00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:08.200]   it's because you're overloaded, there's too much,
[00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:11.400]   your mind is exhausted, it knows it's not sustainable.
[00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:13.200]   So I'm not gonna do this, I'm sorry,
[00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:15.760]   I'm not gonna help on that committee.
[00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:18.560]   This is a bridge too far with like my exercise routine,
[00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:20.120]   whatever it is, reduction.
[00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:24.360]   So when your load is reasonable, it's easier to execute
[00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:26.560]   because you're playing with your wiring here.
[00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:28.960]   Your brain is very good at the things important,
[00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:30.560]   let's set a plan, let's execute that plan,
[00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:32.560]   let's feel really good because we got the plan done.
[00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:34.120]   If you overload that part of your brain,
[00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:36.160]   it short circuits and you lose all of that
[00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:39.000]   evolutionarily optimized inducements
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.520]   to actually do the daily work that's important.
[00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:44.080]   We are wired to do daily stuff that's important
[00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:46.020]   for the survival of us and our families, right?
[00:50:46.020 --> 00:50:49.760]   So let's take advantage of those mechanisms,
[00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:51.520]   but you can't take advantage of those mechanisms
[00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:53.260]   if there's 75 things on your list.
[00:50:53.260 --> 00:50:56.080]   And then clarity would be my final suggestion,
[00:50:56.080 --> 00:50:58.960]   and that is something you touched on before.
[00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:01.160]   Here's my vision, lifestyle-centric career planning,
[00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:02.580]   where we wanna be in five years,
[00:51:02.580 --> 00:51:03.720]   where we wanna be in 10 years,
[00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:05.840]   where we wanna be later this year.
[00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:07.920]   This is how everything fits in.
[00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:09.580]   These type of more mundane chores,
[00:51:09.580 --> 00:51:11.160]   we've really automated and structured,
[00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:12.440]   and there's these other things I'm doing
[00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:15.160]   that's really fulfilling, and we're saving up to do this.
[00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:17.280]   And you have this vision that this is all a part of that.
[00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:18.600]   You mentioned that as being important.
[00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:20.600]   You are right that that is important.
[00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:23.260]   You are building towards a vision that you believe in
[00:51:23.260 --> 00:51:24.520]   and think is important.
[00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:26.880]   You're working backwards from that positive goal.
[00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:29.100]   It's very important to keep things moving.
[00:51:29.100 --> 00:51:32.000]   So if you have kids, for example,
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:36.600]   there's a couple natural milestones to think about.
[00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:39.280]   There's a sort of young kid period,
[00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:40.880]   which is sort of a survival mode.
[00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:42.400]   There's a steady state period
[00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:44.640]   where you have grammar school-aged kids
[00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:47.040]   and what you want life to be like there,
[00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:50.080]   time with them, the role of work, where you live,
[00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:53.320]   really thinking through what that experience is like.
[00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:54.600]   You have a really clear vision for,
[00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:56.840]   okay, when does the last kid leave the house?
[00:51:56.840 --> 00:51:59.480]   These are the changes that are happening then.
[00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:00.480]   I think it's a great time to have
[00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:02.000]   a more substantial change to your lifestyle.
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:04.320]   So you have these very clear visions
[00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:05.800]   that you're working backwards from,
[00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:10.520]   that you're working towards with your day-to-day efforts.
[00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:12.360]   And that, again, you're very right to point that out.
[00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:15.800]   So automate, reduce, clarify.
[00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:17.440]   Do those three things.
[00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:19.640]   That's what's needed to keep making progress
[00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:22.520]   in a disciplined fashion on the stuff that's annoying,
[00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:24.200]   but has to get done.
[00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:27.120]   That's how you avoid just being paralyzed
[00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:31.020]   by exhaustion and indecision and lack of motivation.
[00:52:31.020 --> 00:52:34.400]   All right, well, speaking of motivation,
[00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:35.560]   talk about a couple of sponsors
[00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:37.520]   that make this show possible.
[00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:39.800]   One thing I often lack motivation to do
[00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:44.100]   is go to a physical post office.
[00:52:44.100 --> 00:52:46.200]   We have one right down the street from us here
[00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:50.280]   in the Deep Work HQ, and it is crowded.
[00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:52.840]   You have to wait in these long lines.
[00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:54.640]   It's a little bit depressing.
[00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:59.260]   This is where stamps.com comes to the rescue.
[00:52:59.260 --> 00:53:03.720]   So with stamps.com, you can print official postage
[00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:05.360]   right from your computer.
[00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:07.060]   So you can spend less time at the post office
[00:53:07.060 --> 00:53:10.680]   and more time running your business.
[00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:12.800]   It gives you access to all the post office
[00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:15.000]   and UPS shipping services you need.
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:16.880]   You can do it right from your computer.
[00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:20.840]   You print the postage, you stick it on,
[00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:24.280]   you schedule a pickup, no going to the post office,
[00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:27.740]   no waiting in line.
[00:53:27.740 --> 00:53:30.260]   They're one of these rare business ideas
[00:53:30.260 --> 00:53:32.280]   that just simply makes sense.
[00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:34.120]   It barely even requires to be pitched
[00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:34.940]   because people get it.
[00:53:34.940 --> 00:53:36.080]   Oh, instead of going to the post office,
[00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:37.400]   I print the postage at home.
[00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:38.880]   Got it.
[00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:39.720]   What do we do?
[00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:40.920]   How do we sign up?
[00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:42.800]   Well, I'll tell you how to do that.
[00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:47.520]   You go to stamps.com and you use the promo code DEEP.
[00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:49.380]   And what you're gonna get with that is a special offer
[00:53:49.380 --> 00:53:53.520]   that includes four-week trial, free postage,
[00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:56.400]   and a digital scale with no long-term commitments
[00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:57.600]   or contracts.
[00:53:57.600 --> 00:53:59.320]   You just go to stamps.com,
[00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:00.880]   click the microphone at the top of the page
[00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:02.440]   and enter that code DEEP.
[00:54:03.560 --> 00:54:05.520]   Remember, whether you're sending invoices
[00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:07.720]   or side hustling with an Etsy shop,
[00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:10.160]   or you're a full-blown warehouse shipping out orders,
[00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:13.240]   stamps.com is gonna make your life easier.
[00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:16.280]   You're gonna join over 1 million businesses
[00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:18.160]   that have been using stamps.com for over 20 years.
[00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:22.640]   So go to stamps.com and use that promo code DEEP.
[00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:27.600]   I also wanna tell you about one of the original sponsors
[00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:32.200]   of the DEEP Questions podcast, and that is Grammarly.
[00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:38.200]   Grammarly is a software product that works
[00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:42.000]   on all of the tools in which you do daily writing
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:44.000]   and all of the types of apps or programs
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:46.240]   you use to do this daily writing.
[00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:48.720]   And it helps you make your writing better.
[00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:51.960]   This is really important.
[00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:55.680]   We are here in this winter grind where it's emails all day
[00:54:55.680 --> 00:54:58.360]   and instant messages all day, work is work,
[00:54:58.360 --> 00:55:00.760]   the summer's far away, Christmas break
[00:55:00.760 --> 00:55:01.960]   is in the rear view mirror.
[00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:04.360]   All we're doing all day, it seems like seen on our screens
[00:55:04.360 --> 00:55:05.200]   and communicating.
[00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:06.960]   You want that communication to be crystal clear
[00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:08.640]   so people will take you seriously,
[00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:12.100]   that you will be persuasive so that you will have influence
[00:55:12.100 --> 00:55:13.680]   and respect within your company.
[00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:17.420]   Grammarly is how you make sure that you are doing this.
[00:55:17.420 --> 00:55:19.980]   So I don't know, Jesse, do you remember
[00:55:19.980 --> 00:55:22.280]   the old grammar checkers from the old days
[00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:24.360]   where it would just like underline the words
[00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:26.000]   and tell you like you misspelled there
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:27.400]   or something like that? - Yeah.
[00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:29.520]   - Well, I gotta show you Grammarly Premium
[00:55:29.520 --> 00:55:32.040]   'cause I've been working with it
[00:55:32.040 --> 00:55:36.240]   and am really impressed with what it can do.
[00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:39.240]   It's not just telling you you spelled there wrong,
[00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:41.440]   it can help you rewrite an entire sentence.
[00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:44.920]   It can tell you what the tone is on your email, right?
[00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:47.040]   So you can be like, Jesse, I'm looking at this email
[00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:49.240]   that you're about to send here or something.
[00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:52.160]   And the tone here is that you sound like
[00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:56.080]   that you're coming in a van to carry away their corpse.
[00:55:56.080 --> 00:55:58.920]   So you might wanna adjust that tone
[00:55:58.920 --> 00:56:02.120]   to be a little bit more positive.
[00:56:02.120 --> 00:56:03.820]   No, that's not actually one of the tones,
[00:56:03.820 --> 00:56:05.200]   but it can tell you like this is the tone,
[00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:09.640]   like it's super official, it's super friendly, colloquial,
[00:56:09.640 --> 00:56:11.320]   because you don't always know.
[00:56:11.320 --> 00:56:12.520]   You don't always know when you're writing
[00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:13.840]   how it's coming across.
[00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:16.240]   This program can actually tell you.
[00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:17.640]   It even has clarity suggestions.
[00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:19.880]   I like this one, like it'll come in and say,
[00:56:19.880 --> 00:56:22.120]   hey, there's Steinbeck.
[00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:23.720]   This is me voicing the grammar.
[00:56:23.720 --> 00:56:24.540]   It doesn't actually say this,
[00:56:24.540 --> 00:56:27.280]   but this is what I feel like when I use this tool.
[00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:28.580]   Hey, there's Steinbeck.
[00:56:28.580 --> 00:56:34.200]   This giant adjective, great, you're smart, I love it,
[00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:35.960]   but no one's gonna know what the hell you're talking about.
[00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:38.460]   Like it'd be much clearer if you just use this word,
[00:56:38.460 --> 00:56:40.760]   which actually captures what you're trying to say better.
[00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:42.360]   Grammarly actually does that.
[00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:43.400]   So it's really powerful now.
[00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:45.920]   It's like having an editor who sits over your shoulder
[00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:48.340]   and helps you actually write clearly.
[00:56:48.340 --> 00:56:51.840]   So get through those emails and your work quicker
[00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:53.440]   by keeping it concise, confident,
[00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:54.880]   and effective with Grammarly.
[00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:58.400]   Go to grammarly.com/deep to sign up for a free account.
[00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:01.840]   And when you're ready to upgrade to Grammarly Premium,
[00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:06.200]   you will get 20% off for being a listener of my podcast.
[00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:11.200]   That's 20% off at G-R-A-M-M-A-R-L-Y.com/deep.
[00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:21.600]   Tell you, Jesse, we need something like that
[00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:24.760]   for like most academic departments.
[00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:27.640]   It's like professors, we're all weird and live in bubbles
[00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:30.360]   and we have 10 years, so like no one ever,
[00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:31.440]   our jobs aren't in jeopardy,
[00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:33.840]   and we get weird in our email communication.
[00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:36.440]   And there's always that one professor in every department
[00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:39.800]   that has to send out an incredibly like a grieve
[00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:43.080]   and upset email about everything.
[00:57:43.080 --> 00:57:46.400]   Like you can say, whatever,
[00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:49.560]   FYI, we have a new water cooler.
[00:57:49.560 --> 00:57:50.400]   'Cause the other one broke.
[00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:52.680]   And you will get this long email almost immediately
[00:57:52.680 --> 00:57:57.280]   that is like, in this day and age to have a water cooler,
[00:57:57.280 --> 00:58:00.880]   because my uncle was killed by a water cooler,
[00:58:00.880 --> 00:58:04.200]   and I don't like the way that water cooler looked at me,
[00:58:04.200 --> 00:58:07.720]   and I think it's an antisemitic water cooler,
[00:58:07.720 --> 00:58:10.360]   and also we shouldn't use the word water,
[00:58:10.360 --> 00:58:11.920]   and just mad about everything.
[00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:13.640]   We need like a grammarly.com plugin
[00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:16.080]   that it sits on every academic email server
[00:58:16.080 --> 00:58:17.080]   that just comes back and say,
[00:58:17.080 --> 00:58:19.800]   don't send this, you sound like a crazy person.
[00:58:19.800 --> 00:58:22.040]   Everyone's gonna think you're a crazy person.
[00:58:22.040 --> 00:58:25.320]   And it just flash, just crazy person detection,
[00:58:25.320 --> 00:58:27.400]   because every department has someone
[00:58:27.400 --> 00:58:29.200]   who's just been in their head too long,
[00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:31.520]   and they just are, I just imagine in a dark room
[00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:34.240]   with their, somehow it's a typewriter hooked up
[00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:35.360]   to their email, I don't know how that works.
[00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:37.600]   Just like, I'll show them.
[00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:40.240]   They need a grammarly.com detector that's like,
[00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:43.440]   people are gonna think you are literally insane.
[00:58:43.440 --> 00:58:44.560]   - That's what we need.
[00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:48.040]   - All right, what are we doing here?
[00:58:48.040 --> 00:58:49.080]   55, let's do one more call.
[00:58:49.080 --> 00:58:50.480]   I think we got time for one more call.
[00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:52.000]   - Okay, sounds good.
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:53.960]   This question is from Cameron.
[00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:54.880]   He's in college.
[00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:56.440]   He has a question about your thoughts
[00:58:56.440 --> 00:58:58.480]   on the metaverse, from Meta.
[00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:01.920]   - Hi Cal, college student here.
[00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:03.280]   What are your thoughts on the metaverse
[00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:05.840]   that Meta is currently trying to build?
[00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:08.640]   How do you think that it's going to affect society?
[00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:09.480]   Thank you.
[00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:13.320]   - Well, there's a few things going on here.
[00:59:13.320 --> 00:59:16.600]   One, why is Facebook doing this?
[00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:18.880]   And in part it's because,
[00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:21.080]   as I've been predicting for a few years now,
[00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:24.760]   the age of social media monopoly platforms
[00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:27.120]   has begun its descent.
[00:59:27.120 --> 00:59:28.120]   We just didn't realize it.
[00:59:28.120 --> 00:59:30.280]   Now we're actually starting to see it.
[00:59:30.280 --> 00:59:35.360]   Facebook posted one of their first reductions
[00:59:35.360 --> 00:59:37.040]   in active user minutes,
[00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:39.600]   and their stock lost something like $150 billion.
[00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:43.040]   The biggest in absolute value,
[00:59:43.040 --> 00:59:46.280]   single one-day drop of a company's valuation ever.
[00:59:46.280 --> 00:59:48.880]   So people are leaving Facebook.
[00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:51.200]   People are leaving Instagram.
[00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:56.200]   This era in which there's six platforms you have to use,
[00:59:56.200 --> 00:59:57.160]   or you can't communicate,
[00:59:57.160 --> 00:59:58.800]   and you're completely out of it.
[00:59:58.800 --> 01:00:00.480]   That's all dissolving into a world
[01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:01.920]   of much more niche social media.
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:03.760]   And I've talked about before why this has happened.
[01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:06.560]   I talked about this on Lex Fridman's podcast, for example.
[01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:07.920]   I went into detail on this.
[01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:10.720]   The issue is the network effect,
[01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:12.920]   the main network effect that these platforms had
[01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:15.240]   that made them monopolies
[01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:17.400]   was everyone you know is using them.
[01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:20.160]   And so when their main promise was,
[01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:22.480]   you're gonna update people on what you're up to
[01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:23.760]   and see what people you know are up to,
[01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:26.240]   that network effect dominates.
[01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:28.760]   If I need a place to go to see what people I know are up to,
[01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:30.200]   and they're all on this one platform,
[01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:31.680]   no competitor will succeed.
[01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:33.000]   I have to go to Facebook.
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:33.880]   That was the foundation
[01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:36.720]   on which they built their massive user base.
[01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:38.080]   They then got spooked
[01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:40.000]   because they saw Twitter come out of nowhere
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.040]   and have a lot of success
[01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:44.600]   with this algorithmic curated timeline feature.
[01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:47.320]   And so the main social media companies,
[01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:48.880]   namely Facebook and Instagram,
[01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:50.480]   and then Facebook eventually bought Instagram,
[01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:52.640]   said, well, what we're gonna do instead is,
[01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:54.440]   say these platforms are not about
[01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:55.560]   connecting with people you know,
[01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:57.880]   it's about distraction and entertainment.
[01:00:57.880 --> 01:01:00.080]   We will select articles and posts and things
[01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:01.440]   that are generating a lot of engagement
[01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:03.520]   and we'll put them in an infinite scroll newsfeed.
[01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:05.520]   And you could just click on that F on your phone
[01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:06.880]   when you're bored, and there'll be something there
[01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:09.520]   that's gonna press your buttons in as a good distraction.
[01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:12.360]   That was the beginning of the end for these platforms.
[01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:14.840]   Yes, when you already had 1.3 billion people
[01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:18.240]   on these platforms, they were gonna use it more
[01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:20.840]   in the short term, 'cause that's more interesting
[01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:23.200]   than seeing what your cousin's up to.
[01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:24.920]   But in the longterm, now there's no reason
[01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:26.920]   to be on Facebook if I wanna be entertained.
[01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:31.560]   Yeah, that's entertaining, but so are podcasts.
[01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:33.720]   So are shows on the streaming services.
[01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:35.640]   So are books, you know?
[01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:39.320]   So are any other number of other services
[01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:42.960]   where it could care less if my cousin uses it.
[01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:44.640]   And that's exactly what happened to Facebook,
[01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:46.240]   is like, yes, that was more entertaining
[01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:48.280]   for their existing users, but over time,
[01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:50.760]   their users were saying, I don't really wanna see
[01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:54.680]   Facebook newsfeeds, I wanna watch Yellowstone
[01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:57.800]   over on Paramount and listen to a podcast
[01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:00.680]   on some niche topic I'm really interested in.
[01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:02.320]   This is entertaining, but other things
[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:03.160]   are even more entertaining.
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:05.500]   So they're starting to lose users.
[01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:08.120]   And so what we get instead is the rise
[01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:10.640]   of much more fractured social media,
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:12.240]   where the experience is, okay,
[01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:15.840]   if we're gonna do distraction, let's just do distraction.
[01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:17.760]   And that was TikTok's play.
[01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:20.360]   TikTok said, okay, if this is just about
[01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:22.640]   scrolling things and being distracted,
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:24.760]   let's just plug that matrix cable straight
[01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:26.020]   into the back of your spine.
[01:02:26.020 --> 01:02:28.120]   Let's get rid of the whole, like, my cousin's on here
[01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:29.600]   and I have a wall and I'm connecting to people.
[01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:31.160]   Just get rid of all of that.
[01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:33.840]   And let's just hone in like a laser beam
[01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:37.440]   on just the absolute most in the moment
[01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:41.160]   dopamine hijacking, attention generating style of content.
[01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:43.200]   And don't even worry about where it comes from.
[01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:45.360]   We'll just show you things one after another.
[01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:49.600]   If that's our game here, then let's just purify that.
[01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:50.680]   And that's what TikTok is doing.
[01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:52.420]   And that's why it's sort of eating the lunch
[01:02:52.420 --> 01:02:53.860]   of the other social media platforms,
[01:02:53.860 --> 01:02:54.960]   because it's saying, forget this,
[01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:57.680]   like I wanna connect to people I know stuff.
[01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:01.880]   However, that is a world in which the obligation
[01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:04.220]   to be on these platforms completely dissolves.
[01:03:04.220 --> 01:03:06.740]   And I don't mean to rant too much about this,
[01:03:06.740 --> 01:03:08.760]   but Cameron, I think about this a lot.
[01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:11.520]   Five years ago, when I would say in public,
[01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:14.380]   I don't use social media, I don't use Facebook,
[01:03:14.380 --> 01:03:17.040]   people were aghast.
[01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:19.080]   Like, this is crazy.
[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:22.240]   How can you survive in our society without it?
[01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:23.140]   That's where everyone is.
[01:03:23.140 --> 01:03:24.080]   That's how you know what's going on.
[01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:25.340]   That's where all the cultural trends are.
[01:03:25.340 --> 01:03:26.420]   That's where all the news is.
[01:03:26.420 --> 01:03:27.620]   That's how you get business.
[01:03:27.620 --> 01:03:29.640]   In an age of TikTok, no one cares anymore
[01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:31.140]   if you're not using it.
[01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:35.040]   'Cause it's just purified dopamine distraction.
[01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:37.960]   So if you say, hey, I don't have a TikTok account.
[01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:40.080]   No one's like, how do you survive?
[01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:41.960]   Like, yeah, I know it's weird.
[01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:43.260]   You know, it's fun,
[01:03:43.260 --> 01:03:46.760]   but there's no expectation that you would use it.
[01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:48.880]   And that's actually way more healthy relationship
[01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:49.720]   with these tools.
[01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:52.520]   And so what we're gonna get is TikTok 2.0 and 3.0,
[01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:54.680]   all sorts of different services
[01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:58.020]   that directly press buttons in very specific types of ways.
[01:03:58.020 --> 01:04:00.400]   A clubhouse was like this.
[01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:01.840]   It was doing something else very specific,
[01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:02.820]   was very interesting.
[01:04:02.820 --> 01:04:04.840]   None of which have any network effect requirements.
[01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:08.080]   I don't need my cousin and my friends from high school
[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:10.120]   and my grandfather to be on TikTok
[01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:12.400]   for it to be useful in its promise to me.
[01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:13.240]   It's promised to me is like,
[01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:14.680]   we're gonna show you these videos
[01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:16.480]   and there's gonna be a cat on it
[01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:18.540]   and it's gonna be entertaining.
[01:04:18.540 --> 01:04:21.000]   And so once you got rid of the network effects,
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.440]   this whole thing is just gonna fragment
[01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:24.580]   into lots of different sources of entertainment.
[01:04:24.580 --> 01:04:27.120]   Some different than others, some much more base,
[01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:28.280]   some much more high end.
[01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:29.680]   It doesn't matter.
[01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:32.160]   And no one will be expected to use any one of these things.
[01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:33.120]   And it's not a weirdness
[01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:34.440]   if you don't use any one of these things.
[01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:36.760]   And that's actually a much better, healthier world.
[01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:39.280]   This more long tail niche social media type world
[01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:42.120]   that's less about connection and more about distraction
[01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:43.880]   is fine and that's where we're going.
[01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:46.480]   And you can't be a $700 billion a year
[01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:49.360]   social media company anymore once we get to that world.
[01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:51.000]   And that's what Facebook sees.
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.200]   And that's why they're trying to shift away from it.
[01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:56.720]   So that's the whole background for what's going on.
[01:04:56.720 --> 01:04:59.740]   I think the particular meta vision that we see now,
[01:04:59.740 --> 01:05:01.880]   which tends to be focused on social life occurring
[01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:04.120]   in virtual reality, that's a smoke screen.
[01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:07.360]   That's not the big headline.
[01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:09.140]   The big headline with these technologies
[01:05:09.140 --> 01:05:11.120]   is going to be the dissipation
[01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:14.220]   of the personal electronics industry.
[01:05:14.220 --> 01:05:17.040]   I was talking to some people in the industry about this
[01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:19.560]   when I was doing a New Yorker piece last fall
[01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:21.480]   about people who work in virtual reality.
[01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:24.680]   This Cameron is the trend that is much more powerful.
[01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:27.120]   And the trend works as follows.
[01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:30.900]   Once augmented reality glasses get to a certain level
[01:05:30.900 --> 01:05:35.900]   of quality, and once we have sufficient high-speed internet
[01:05:35.900 --> 01:05:39.740]   wherever we need to be, and we're very close to that,
[01:05:39.740 --> 01:05:42.280]   there'll be no need to own any other consumer electronics
[01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:43.340]   beyond those glasses.
[01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:46.740]   If I want to use a computer,
[01:05:46.740 --> 01:05:48.920]   I don't buy a computer from Apple.
[01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:52.880]   There is a instance in some Amazon virtualization cloud
[01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:55.860]   somewhere of my computer running in a giant server farm
[01:05:55.860 --> 01:05:58.280]   and my AR glasses will create a screen
[01:05:58.280 --> 01:06:00.360]   wherever I want in the environment in front of me.
[01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:02.320]   And there is a screen of whatever size I want.
[01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:03.520]   And there I work on my computer.
[01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:04.600]   If I need to use my phone,
[01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:07.040]   I do not need to own an iPhone or an Android phone.
[01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:08.320]   I have my glasses on.
[01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:10.040]   I can just pull my hands down
[01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:11.640]   and there is the list of my contacts
[01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:13.460]   and I can see who's texting me.
[01:06:13.460 --> 01:06:14.340]   I don't need a separate phone.
[01:06:14.340 --> 01:06:17.520]   If I want to watch TV, I do not need a 65 inch TV.
[01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:21.160]   I can make a 65 inch TV show up wherever I want in my house.
[01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:22.800]   And it can be in a position
[01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:24.320]   where I see it through my AR goggles,
[01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:25.800]   but everyone else in my house sees it
[01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:26.900]   in the exact same position.
[01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:28.540]   We can't tell the difference between that screen
[01:06:28.540 --> 01:06:31.560]   being there in real life or not.
[01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:33.760]   There's no need to actually buy or own TVs.
[01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:37.160]   That is the huge game changer that is coming.
[01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:40.520]   The virtualization of computation into the cloud
[01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:42.800]   and the replacement of interfaces
[01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:44.660]   with augmented reality goggles.
[01:06:44.660 --> 01:06:48.200]   Many companies disappear once that happens.
[01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:51.240]   What's the Foxconn plant,
[01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:53.440]   Apple's Foxconn plant gonna do
[01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:54.780]   when there's no iPhones to produce,
[01:06:54.780 --> 01:06:57.060]   there's no iMacs to produce?
[01:06:57.060 --> 01:06:58.000]   What are they gonna do?
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.120]   You know, that's gonna go out of business.
[01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:00.360]   What's Samsung gonna do
[01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:03.980]   when high-end Android phones
[01:07:03.980 --> 01:07:06.240]   and large screen TVs don't need to exist?
[01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:09.280]   It's gonna disappear.
[01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:11.120]   It's gonna be a huge change
[01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:13.140]   to the digital electronics industry.
[01:07:13.140 --> 01:07:14.440]   And guess what?
[01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:16.920]   All of the major players are investing huge amounts of money
[01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:19.240]   to make sure that they are not going to lose
[01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:20.320]   in that game of musical chairs.
[01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:22.080]   Yes, Facebook talks about Meta.
[01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:25.560]   Facebook is also caring a lot about this future
[01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:27.620]   of virtualized consumer electronics.
[01:07:27.620 --> 01:07:30.480]   They are spending a lot of money on, guess what?
[01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:33.600]   Their own pair of these augmented reality glasses.
[01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:36.080]   Apple is putting a ton of money into this as well
[01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:38.880]   because it is existential for Apple.
[01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:40.320]   Apple is a trillion dollar company
[01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:42.440]   that will disappear and no longer exist
[01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:44.980]   if they don't win the fight to be the people
[01:07:44.980 --> 01:07:47.400]   who produce the best glasses that virtualize all this,
[01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:49.040]   because you don't produce iPhones
[01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:51.000]   in a world of augmented reality.
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.120]   Amazon and Google are betting big on both.
[01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:55.480]   Google is betting big on the glasses front.
[01:07:55.480 --> 01:07:57.080]   They're doing that with Magic Leap,
[01:07:57.080 --> 01:08:00.240]   which they put well over a billion dollars into.
[01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:02.800]   Amazon is trying to be the back-end computation.
[01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:04.320]   So if we don't actually have a phone,
[01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:05.760]   if we don't actually have a computer,
[01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:07.160]   where does that computation happen?
[01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:09.200]   Amazon is saying, "We'll do it.
[01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:10.800]   "We're not just virtualizing computation.
[01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:12.260]   "We're virtualizing hardware.
[01:08:12.260 --> 01:08:14.400]   "We can make anything you want happen in our servers,
[01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:16.640]   "and we'll just beam the screen to wherever you are."
[01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:18.480]   So Cameron, that is the big trend.
[01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:19.440]   That is going to be the trend
[01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:21.800]   that's going to completely upend our industry.
[01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:25.180]   Not, as Mark Zuckerberg videos would seem to imply,
[01:08:25.180 --> 01:08:28.560]   us playing cards in virtual reality in a space station
[01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:30.280]   with some of our friends.
[01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:32.560]   That's not that interesting to me.
[01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:34.080]   The thing that's going to upend our world
[01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:36.640]   is all interfaces are virtual.
[01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:39.360]   All computation happens on Amazon servers.
[01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:41.920]   And 80% of the major digital electronics companies
[01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:44.440]   that exist today no longer exist in any way,
[01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:46.600]   anywhere like how we see them today.
[01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:49.200]   That's what I would keep my eyes on,
[01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:52.480]   not being in one of these weird virtual reality
[01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:56.740]   space stations and doing Facebook with avatars
[01:08:56.740 --> 01:08:57.920]   or something like this.
[01:08:57.920 --> 01:08:59.180]   Interesting stuff could happen there,
[01:08:59.180 --> 01:09:01.880]   but that's not where my eye is right now.
[01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:04.460]   All right, well, speaking of where my eye is right now,
[01:09:04.460 --> 01:09:05.580]   I think we've run a little long,
[01:09:05.580 --> 01:09:09.140]   so we should probably wrap up this week's episode.
[01:09:09.140 --> 01:09:10.960]   Thank you to everyone who called in.
[01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:13.720]   If you go to calnewport.com/podcast,
[01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:15.460]   you can get instructions on how you too
[01:09:15.460 --> 01:09:17.500]   can submit your own listener calls.
[01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:20.240]   Videos of this episode and every question discussed
[01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:22.660]   are available on our YouTube page.
