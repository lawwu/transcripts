[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.360]   the next tactic is mixed cabin awards this has both a pro and a con so most of the times there's
[00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:10.960]   actually no discount if part of your trip is an economy and the rest of it is in business you want
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.200]   to make sure that you're keeping an eye on this because there are some websites where they'll say
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.680]   this is a mixed cabin award and if you don't look into what that mixed cabin is so let's say you're
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.080]   going from san francisco to la to japan if that san francisco to la flights in economy and the long
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.760]   haul is in business that's great that might be totally fine for you but if the opposite is true
[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:33.120]   and it says first class but it's actually just first class to la and then economy to japan that's
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.480]   going to be a terrible redemption of points however where this can become valuable is sometimes those
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:46.880]   domestic legs are really tough to find in business class and so if you can't find san francisco to tokyo
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:52.240]   in business class because you're only looking for a hundred percent business class you might be able
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:58.400]   to find an award where you fly in coach to a connecting city in seattle or los angeles and
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.920]   then connect on in business class
