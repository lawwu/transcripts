[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab guest series,
[00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.120]   where I and an expert guest discuss science
[00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.280]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.720]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.720]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.680]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.400]   Today's episode marks the fourth
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.000]   in our six-episode series all about sleep
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.320]   with expert guest, Dr. Matthew Walker.
[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.180]   During today's episode, we discuss sleep and learning,
[00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.680]   as well as the impact of sleep
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.400]   and the specific stages of sleep on creativity and memory.
[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.520]   We talk about when and how long to sleep
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.600]   relative to different bouts of learning,
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.360]   as well as the role of naps in consolidating information
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.600]   that you are trying to learn.
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.980]   We discuss the science and protocols of sleep
[00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.640]   as it relates to both cognitive learning and motor learning,
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.400]   and the mechanism by which sleep encodes memories.
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.600]   As with the previous episodes in this series,
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.200]   today's episode includes information
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.340]   about the biology of sleep, as well as practical tools,
[00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.120]   that is protocols, in which you can use sleep
[00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.240]   to improve your learning, memory, and creativity.
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.880]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.560]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.680]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.320]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.000]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.240]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.920]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.160]   Our first sponsor is Helix Sleep.
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.000]   Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.600]   that are customized to your unique sleep needs.
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.000]   It's abundantly clear that sleep is the foundation
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.520]   of mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.200]   When we're getting enough quality sleep,
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.760]   everything in life goes so much better,
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.920]   and when we are not getting enough quality sleep,
[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.360]   everything in life is that much more challenging.
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.520]   And one of the key things to getting a great night's sleep
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.480]   is to have the appropriate mattress.
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.440]   Everyone, however, has slightly different needs
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.240]   in terms of what would be the optimal mattress for them.
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.720]   Helix understands that people have unique sleep needs,
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.000]   and they've designed a brief two-minute quiz
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.440]   that asks you questions like, do you sleep on your back,
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.400]   your side, or your stomach?
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.080]   Do you tend to run hot or cold during the night?
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.280]   Or maybe you don't know the answers to those questions.
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.160]   If you go to the Helix site and take that brief quiz,
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.640]   they'll match you to a mattress that's optimal for you.
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.560]   For me, it turned out to be the Dusk D-U-S-K mattress.
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.000]   It's not too hard, not too soft,
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.320]   and I sleep so much better on my Helix mattress
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.800]   than on any other type of mattress I've used before.
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.000]   So if you're interested in upgrading your mattress,
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.800]   go to helixsleep.com/huberman,
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.520]   take their brief two-minute sleep quiz,
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.560]   and they'll match you to a customized mattress for you,
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.800]   and you'll get up to $350 off any mattress order
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.080]   and two free pillows.
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.200]   Again, that's helixsleep.com/huberman
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.640]   to save up to $350 off and two free pillows.
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.560]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Woop.
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.080]   Woop is a fitness wearable device
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.280]   that tracks your daily activity and sleep,
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.160]   but also goes beyond that by providing real-time feedback
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.360]   on how to adjust your training and sleep schedule
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.800]   to perform better.
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:43.640]   I've been working with Woop
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.640]   on their Scientific Advisory Council
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.560]   to try and help advance Woop's mission
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.520]   of unlocking human performance.
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.580]   As a Woop user, I've experienced the health benefits
[00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.740]   of their technology firsthand for sleep tracking,
[00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.840]   for monitoring other features of my physiology,
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.800]   and for giving me a lot of feedback
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.120]   about metrics within my brain and body
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.480]   that tell me how hard I should train or not train,
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.860]   and basically point to the things that I'm doing correctly
[00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.600]   and incorrectly in my daily life
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.560]   that I can adjust using protocols,
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.240]   some of which are actually within the Woop app.
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.540]   Given that many of us have goals
[00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.320]   such as improving our sleep, building better habits,
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.600]   or just focusing more on our overall health,
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.520]   Woop is one of the tools
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.540]   that can really help you get personalized data,
[00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.640]   recommendations, and coaching toward your overall health.
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.480]   In addition to being
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.520]   one of the most accurate sleep trackers in the world,
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.060]   Woop allows you to recover more quickly and fully
[00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.360]   from physical exercise and other kinds of stress,
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.360]   and thereby to train more effectively and sleep better.
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.880]   If you're interested in trying Woop,
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.600]   you can go to join.woop.com/huberman today
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.920]   to get your first month free.
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.280]   Again, that's join.woop.com/huberman.
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.660]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Waking Up.
[00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.640]   The Waking Up app is a meditation app
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.880]   that offers hundreds of guided meditations,
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.260]   mindfulness trainings, yoga nidra sessions,
[00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:55.100]   and more.
[00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.540]   I started meditating over 30 years ago.
[00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.320]   At that time, there wasn't very much science on meditation,
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.240]   but by now we know that there's a lot of strong science
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.680]   supporting the fact that a daily meditation practice
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.560]   can improve mood, focus, and alertness,
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.720]   and can reduce stress and improve sleep and overall health.
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.560]   One thing that I and many others have noticed
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.480]   is that while meditation is excellent for buffering stress,
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.200]   it's oftentimes during periods of stress
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.440]   that we let our meditation practice go.
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.920]   The Waking Up app overcomes this
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.000]   by offering meditations of different durations.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.700]   So they have some longer ones of 30 to 60 minutes,
[00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.120]   but also some much briefer ones, 10, five,
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.560]   and even one minute meditations
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.200]   that are known to be effective.
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.920]   So no matter how busy or stressed you get,
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.200]   you always make time for your meditation practice.
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.720]   The fact that they have lots of different types
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.540]   of meditations and yoga nidra sessions
[00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.520]   and non-sleep deep rest protocols
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.040]   also make sure that your meditations
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.520]   are kept fresh and interesting.
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:46.880]   You never get bored of them.
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.320]   I personally use the Waking Up app
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.080]   to do a five to 10 minute meditation
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.200]   or a non-sleep deep rest protocol,
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.600]   which is similar to yoga nidra each and every day.
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.720]   And if I miss a day,
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.220]   I try and double up the amount of time
[00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.080]   that I do NSDR, yoga nidra, or meditation the following day.
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.400]   Yoga nidra and non-sleep deep rest protocols
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.740]   can be done essentially any time of day
[00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.100]   in order to restore mental and physical vigor.
[00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.720]   I'll sometimes do one first thing in the morning
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.400]   if I wake up and I feel I didn't get
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.260]   quite enough sleep the previous night.
[00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.400]   You can also do yoga nidra or NSDR
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.600]   in the middle of the night
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:17.920]   if you wake up and you're having trouble
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.160]   falling back asleep.
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.960]   Sometimes they will allow you to fall back asleep,
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.480]   and if they don't, you'll still feel more refreshed
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.240]   than you would have had you been tossing and turning
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.400]   and worrying about not getting sleep.
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.740]   So NSDR and yoga nidra are terrific
[00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.440]   for both restoring mental and physical vigor
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.400]   and potentially for restoring sleep
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.040]   that you otherwise would have missed.
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.520]   If you'd like to try the Waking Up app,
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.600]   you can go to wakingup.com/huberman
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.320]   to get a free 30 day trial.
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.220]   Again, that's wakingup.com/huberman.
[00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.440]   And now for my conversation with Dr. Matthew Walker.
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:49.460]   Dr. Walker.
[00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:50.760]   - Dr. Huberman.
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:51.600]   Welcome back.
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.080]   We have covered a lot of material.
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.320]   First episode of this series,
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.000]   you gave us an overview of sleep
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.900]   and some actionable items about sleep.
[00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.120]   Then in the second episode,
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.920]   you gave us far more actionable items
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.300]   of how to think about one's sleep
[00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.940]   in a way that leads to very concrete decisions
[00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.380]   about controlling light, temperature, when to sleep,
[00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:19.520]   and then some really in-depth advanced tools
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.640]   or protocols as we call them.
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.600]   And then in the third episode,
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:27.200]   we talked about caffeine and napping
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.920]   and some other things that people can do
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.280]   to really supercharge their alertness
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:35.360]   through sleep augmentation in the daytime.
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.700]   And today we're going to talk about sleep,
[00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:39.860]   learning and memory,
[00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.240]   and a topic that I know everybody
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.640]   is very interested in, creativity.
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.160]   - Indeed.
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.360]   Resplendent pleasure to be back on the show.
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:49.280]   Thank you for having me.
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:50.560]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:54.720]   So I think nowadays most people understand
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:58.280]   that there's some relationship between sleep and learning.
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.080]   But I think it would still be a good idea
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.480]   for us to zoom out a bit
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:05.240]   and establish what that relationship is.
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.920]   You know, I think most people are familiar
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:10.080]   with being exposed to some new material,
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.200]   cognitive material, physical skill material,
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.760]   and not being able to learn it right away,
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:18.580]   but then having a few days in between.
[00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:20.800]   And then all of a sudden, voila.
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:21.640]   - Yeah.
[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:25.760]   - There's a, the skill has been embedded, it seems.
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.840]   But not obvious in that scenario
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:30.400]   is that sleep is perhaps the pivotal event
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.720]   that allowed the learning process to take place.
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.800]   So how do you think about sleep
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.520]   as it relates to learning and memory?
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:42.400]   - I think I've conceptualized it in three different stages
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.420]   or three different buckets of a benefit.
[00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:49.920]   The first is that we need sleep before learning
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:54.280]   to prepare your brain to initially imprint
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:57.780]   and lay those memory traces down.
[00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:02.000]   But then you need to sleep after learning
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.120]   to take those sort of freshly minted memories
[00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:09.920]   and then save them and cement them into the brain
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.200]   so that you don't lose them.
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:16.620]   The third domain is that sleep will then take
[00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:19.140]   those new memories that you've been learning
[00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:21.620]   and it will start to collide them
[00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:24.620]   with all of this back catalog of information
[00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:27.860]   that you've already got stored in your brain.
[00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:32.860]   And it updates the iOS of your informational systems
[00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:35.940]   so that then you come back the next day
[00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:39.460]   and you have a better abled ability
[00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:42.380]   to understand how the world works.
[00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:44.220]   In other words, the difference between knowledge,
[00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:47.380]   which is learning the facts and wisdom,
[00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:51.340]   which is knowing what it all means when you put it together.
[00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:53.460]   That's the third category.
[00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:55.100]   And why is that beneficial?
[00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:58.940]   Because it provides you with creative insights.
[00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:01.340]   And so we will perhaps just double click
[00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:04.460]   on each of those three and I can expand them
[00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:08.080]   because the data behind them is utterly fascinating.
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:10.740]   As you said, I think many people subjectively have a sense
[00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:15.400]   that sleep helps me with my memory in some way,
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:17.240]   but in what way?
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:19.540]   And for people, I think one of the things that you do here
[00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:21.100]   is not just protocols,
[00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:25.020]   but you help explain the conceptual understanding
[00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:28.940]   or the conceptual mechanisms underlying the reasons
[00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:30.220]   for all of these protocols.
[00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:32.620]   And I would love to dive into detail.
[00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:34.060]   - Yeah, so let's do that.
[00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:37.860]   Let's talk about this business of sleeping before learning.
[00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:41.940]   Essentially establishing a milieu within the brain
[00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:43.540]   that is optimal for learning.
[00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:45.400]   What is that about?
[00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:48.460]   Neurochemically at the level of circuits
[00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:52.380]   and what is the evidence that providing some,
[00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:54.980]   I don't know, additional sleep or just adequate sleep
[00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:57.220]   prior to the exposure to the new material
[00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:58.940]   can be beneficial?
[00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:02.140]   - Yeah, I love that word, that optimal milieu
[00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:04.620]   and it beautifully describes what we found.
[00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:08.180]   We started off asking a very simple question
[00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:09.740]   at my sleep center.
[00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:12.820]   Is pulling the all-nighter a wise idea?
[00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:18.180]   So we took a group of perfectly healthy, smart individuals
[00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:21.120]   and we assigned them to one of two experimental groups,
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:23.680]   a sleep group and a sleep deprivation group.
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.540]   And both of those groups
[00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:28.780]   went through those two different protocols.
[00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:32.700]   And then the next day after sleep or after no sleep,
[00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:35.060]   we put them inside of a brain scanner
[00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:38.920]   and we had them try and learn a whole list of new facts
[00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:42.020]   as we were taking snapshots of brain activity.
[00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:43.540]   And then we tested them
[00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:46.540]   to see how effective that learning had been.
[00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:48.580]   When we looked at the group
[00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:50.660]   that had had a full night of sleep,
[00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:54.300]   they had incredibly efficient learning capacity.
[00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:56.340]   So in other words, they had learned
[00:10:56.340 --> 00:11:00.140]   and imprinted that information initially very well.
[00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:03.880]   When we looked at the sleep deprivation group, not so much.
[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:07.260]   In fact, there was a 40% deficit
[00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:08.900]   in the ability of the brain
[00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:12.620]   to make new memories without sleep.
[00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:14.460]   And we've used lots of different types.
[00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:15.920]   We've replicated that now.
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:17.580]   We've had visual information.
[00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:19.900]   We've had textbook-like information.
[00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:24.500]   And the range is somewhere between 20 to 40%.
[00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:26.020]   I find that, by the way, striking
[00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:27.860]   and we can come back to this
[00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:29.420]   based on what we are seeing
[00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:32.340]   in our educational systems right now.
[00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:34.420]   There is this paucity of sleep
[00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:37.540]   because of this model of early school start times.
[00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:39.540]   And I'll explain exactly what's happened there
[00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:42.500]   and what we've been doing to try to change that.
[00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:45.180]   But coming back to those two groups,
[00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:47.620]   the sleep group and the sleep deprivation group,
[00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:51.100]   what was going on, as you said, inside of the brain
[00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:54.740]   that would help us understand why they couldn't learn
[00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:57.100]   or at least couldn't learn effectively?
[00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:58.780]   And the structure that we focused on
[00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:01.780]   is one you've spoken about before called the hippocampus.
[00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:03.920]   And you have one on the left side
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:05.040]   and the right side of your brain.
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:07.540]   It looks like a long cigar that runs down
[00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:10.180]   the left and right side of your brain.
[00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:12.580]   And people listening can think of the hippocampus
[00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:15.660]   almost like the informational inbox of your brain.
[00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:18.360]   It's very good at receiving new memory files
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:20.300]   and then holding onto them.
[00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:21.780]   And when we looked at that structure
[00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:24.840]   and its activity during learning in the sleep group,
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:28.580]   they had wonderful, powerful activation of the hippocampus
[00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:31.120]   as if it was gobbling up all of that new information
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:32.360]   into the inbox.
[00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:35.580]   When we looked at the sleep deprivation group, however,
[00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:39.400]   we couldn't find any significant signal whatsoever.
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:43.100]   So it was almost as though sleep deprivation
[00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:47.460]   had shut down the memory inbox and any new incoming files,
[00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:49.180]   they were just being bounced.
[00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:53.860]   You couldn't effectively commit new experiences to memory.
[00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:56.740]   And then subsequent studies that were not done by us,
[00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:59.340]   but looking at animal models,
[00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:03.960]   they were looking at how able the synapses are
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:06.500]   in that memory structure, the hippocampus,
[00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:11.300]   how capable those synapses are for building new connections.
[00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:14.020]   And the synapses are just those connections between neurons.
[00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:17.300]   And we think that part of the way that we make memories
[00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:19.700]   is by strengthening the connection
[00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:22.500]   in the memory circuit itself.
[00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:26.280]   And what they found was that when they restricted the sleep
[00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:28.300]   of these rats or the mice,
[00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:31.940]   that part of the brain became very stubborn.
[00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:35.540]   It just wouldn't form those new synaptic connections.
[00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:38.200]   And something that we call synaptic plasticity.
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:43.500]   So we started to understand this was the bad that happened
[00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:46.020]   when you take sleep away.
[00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:47.940]   But let's come back to that control group
[00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:50.380]   that I said got a full night of sleep.
[00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:54.060]   Exactly what is it about sleep when you do get it
[00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:57.240]   that seems to support and promote your learning ability?
[00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:00.920]   So we decided to do another different study.
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:04.220]   Instead of manipulating sleep by dialing it down,
[00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:08.680]   we instead tried to dial it up by way of a daytime nap.
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:10.460]   And again, we took two groups
[00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:12.980]   and we had them initially learn, again,
[00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:15.500]   a huge amount of factual information.
[00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:18.340]   They learned it over and over and over again.
[00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:23.340]   And then we brought them back six hours later at 6 p.m.
[00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:28.140]   and now we had them learn a whole new set of information.
[00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:31.700]   And after each one of those fresh novel learning sessions,
[00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:33.620]   we tested them to see how effective
[00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:35.060]   that learning had been again.
[00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:40.140]   One of those groups spent that six hours of time awake,
[00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:42.580]   doing just relaxing activities.
[00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:46.740]   The other group was able to obtain a 90 minute nap.
[00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:48.620]   And we use that 90 minute nap to allow them
[00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:51.220]   to go through a full sort of average cycle
[00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:53.220]   to get some non-REM and to get some REM.
[00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:57.140]   What was interesting is that when we tested the group
[00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:00.260]   that remained awake later that following day,
[00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.340]   the learning capacity had declined.
[00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:06.260]   But in the nap group,
[00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:10.260]   it seemed to restore the brain's capacity to learn.
[00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.140]   And you didn't get that decline in memory.
[00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:15.140]   In fact, if anything, you got a little boost.
[00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:18.620]   And the difference between those two was about 20%.
[00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:20.340]   Just quite a nice benefit.
[00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:21.340]   - Yeah, not trivial.
[00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:23.500]   - Not trivial at all.
[00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:26.540]   And then we said, okay, well, if sleep is doing something,
[00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:28.660]   what is it about that sleep?
[00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:30.980]   So we unpacked the physiology of sleep
[00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:32.420]   and the different stages of sleep
[00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:34.740]   that we discussed in the first episode.
[00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:36.740]   And what we found was that it was
[00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:40.300]   the non-rapid eye movement sleep or the non-REM sleep.
[00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:42.300]   And particularly those sleep spindles,
[00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:44.660]   those short bursts of electrical activity
[00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:47.020]   that we have discussed before,
[00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:50.460]   that seemed to predict how restored
[00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:53.260]   and refreshed your learning ability was.
[00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:57.700]   And the best way that I've been thinking about this
[00:15:57.700 --> 00:15:59.380]   in terms of sleep restoring
[00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:02.540]   or refreshing your encoding ability,
[00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:03.780]   and it's a crass analogy,
[00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:06.540]   and I don't mean to make a direct brain-to-computer analogy,
[00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:10.980]   but think of that hippocampus almost like a USB stick.
[00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:12.500]   That's very good during the day
[00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:15.220]   at going around and grabbing new files,
[00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:18.460]   but it has a limited storage capacity.
[00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:21.020]   And what sleep was doing seemed to be
[00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:24.660]   shifting those memories from the USB stick
[00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:28.060]   of your hippocampus over up to the cortex,
[00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:29.740]   which you can think of almost like your hard drive,
[00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:31.820]   a much bigger storage capacity.
[00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:33.060]   And by way of doing that,
[00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:34.900]   when you woke up after the nap
[00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:36.980]   or after a full night of sleep,
[00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:39.220]   you had this cleared out USB stick.
[00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:40.220]   So what could you do?
[00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:41.300]   You could go around
[00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:44.380]   and start acquiring all these new files again.
[00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:48.540]   So that started to teach us a little bit about
[00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:51.300]   why sleep before learning is critical,
[00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:54.060]   but also mechanistically how sleep
[00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:58.260]   is doing this remarkable work of memory restoration.
[00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.380]   We then wanted to say,
[00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:04.260]   well, can we translate this out into the real world?
[00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:06.380]   And I think there are two regions
[00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:07.860]   that we've moved this work out into.
[00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:11.580]   One is education, one is medicine and Alzheimer's disease.
[00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:14.940]   But the education piece was very interesting.
[00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:18.220]   In the United States, I think the last time I checked,
[00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:20.500]   the average school start time
[00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:23.980]   is somewhere around 7.30, 7.45.
[00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:25.460]   - Sounds about right.
[00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:29.420]   - And if you think about that for 7.30 school start times,
[00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:32.060]   school buses will begin leaving
[00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:36.220]   around 5.30, 5.45 in the morning.
[00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:38.580]   That means that some kids are having to wake up
[00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:42.340]   at 5 a.m., maybe even earlier.
[00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:45.420]   This is lunacy when you think about it.
[00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:47.620]   And there's a great study in Edna,
[00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:49.700]   I hope I'm pronouncing that correct, Edna,
[00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:52.460]   which is a small suburb or it sits in a small suburb
[00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:55.140]   outside of Minneapolis in Minnesota.
[00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:57.420]   And they shifted their school start times
[00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:01.940]   from 7.25 to 8.30 in the morning.
[00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:05.500]   And then they wanted to ask what is the consequence of that
[00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:08.380]   on the academic performance of their students?
[00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:11.340]   And the metric that they used in these teenagers
[00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:12.340]   that they were focusing on
[00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:14.660]   was something called the SAT score,
[00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:16.260]   which is a score I had to learn
[00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:17.940]   when I first came to the United States,
[00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:20.780]   is a critical assessment test
[00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:24.180]   that will largely determine which university you go to.
[00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:27.020]   And they did an analysis which was clever.
[00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:31.540]   They focused on the top 10% performing students,
[00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:32.740]   which you could argue,
[00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:34.420]   those are the ones that are closest
[00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:36.140]   to the ceiling performance
[00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:40.060]   and the hardest to expect any benefit from sleep.
[00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:43.100]   So in the year before they made the time change,
[00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:46.700]   the average score of those top 10% performing students
[00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:51.700]   was 1,288, which turns out to be a pretty good SAT score.
[00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:56.100]   The following year after they made the time change,
[00:18:56.100 --> 00:19:01.100]   the average score for that top 10% was 1,500.
[00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:05.940]   That difference is non-trivial
[00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:10.220]   and it will change exactly where those individuals
[00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:11.660]   will go to university
[00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:13.260]   in terms of the tier of the university
[00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:16.220]   and likely change the trajectory of their lives
[00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:18.020]   as a consequence.
[00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:20.100]   Now, some people have argued that data,
[00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:23.620]   in terms of its source and its reliability
[00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:25.420]   may not have necessarily been accurate,
[00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:28.860]   but now we've got very consistent data.
[00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:32.100]   When you start school times later,
[00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:34.300]   academic grades improve,
[00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:38.100]   psychological and psychiatric problems decrease,
[00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:40.700]   truancy rates decrease.
[00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:43.500]   But something else happened in that story
[00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:46.620]   of later school start times that we didn't expect,
[00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:50.660]   which was that the life expectancy of students increased.
[00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:52.300]   And you think, well, hang on a second,
[00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:53.900]   how do you determine that?
[00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:59.820]   The number one cause of death in teenagers 16 to 18
[00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:03.980]   is actually not suicide, it turns out to be second,
[00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:06.460]   it's road traffic accidents.
[00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:09.140]   And here sleep matters enormously.
[00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:10.420]   There was another great example
[00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:13.380]   from Teton County in Wyoming,
[00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:15.500]   and they shifted their school start times
[00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:19.820]   from I think it was 7.35 in the morning to 8.55.
[00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:21.180]   And the only thing more remarkable
[00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:22.780]   than the extra one hour of sleep
[00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:26.980]   those kids reported getting was the drop in car accidents.
[00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:30.940]   That following year, there was a 70% reduction
[00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:34.620]   in car crashes in that age range of 16 to 18.
[00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:36.460]   - What time are they getting out of school?
[00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:39.300]   - Well, they will probably be ejected out of school.
[00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:41.220]   That's another interesting part, by the way,
[00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:43.540]   maybe around 4.30.
[00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:46.340]   And people have said, well, look,
[00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:50.980]   all of this idea of later school start times,
[00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:52.940]   it means that it's going to cost us more
[00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:55.220]   'cause you've got to change the school bus system.
[00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:58.100]   And they've argued pushback against that.
[00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:00.740]   And I would say probably two things.
[00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:02.860]   First, I know it's difficult,
[00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:04.860]   and I'm not saying it's an easy problem to do,
[00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:06.780]   it's a complex problem.
[00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:08.700]   And I'm sympathetic to that.
[00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:11.820]   But I think we've put people on the moon.
[00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:14.620]   And so I suspect that we can also solve the problem
[00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:16.700]   of early school start times.
[00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:20.940]   The other component of that is
[00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:25.380]   what are we doing as educators?
[00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:30.300]   If our goal as educators is truly to educate
[00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:33.380]   and not risk lives in the process,
[00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:35.340]   then we are failing our children
[00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:37.780]   in a most spectacular manner
[00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:41.700]   with this incessant model of early school start times.
[00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:44.540]   And if you look at the data, it's very clear.
[00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:48.780]   When sleep is abundant, minds flourish.
[00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:51.260]   And when it's not, they don't.
[00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:54.100]   And so that's the reason why myself
[00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:56.380]   and a whole group of sleep scientists,
[00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:58.660]   we started to try to create a movement
[00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:00.340]   for later school start times.
[00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:03.780]   And we got this bill passed firstly in California,
[00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:06.180]   and we got it on the governor's desk at the time.
[00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:07.940]   It was Governor Brown.
[00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:11.300]   And unfortunately, he didn't sign it into law.
[00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:14.700]   Then when the organization changed
[00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:17.820]   and Governor Newsom came in as governor of California,
[00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:21.380]   we got the bill back on his desk and he did sign it.
[00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:24.500]   And then the next state to go was New York.
[00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:26.900]   They started to put in legislation
[00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:28.860]   for recommendations for later school start times.
[00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:33.180]   I think Florida is about to fall as well in that regard.
[00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:36.580]   So there's gradual movement happening,
[00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:41.620]   but it's hard fought and it's problematic.
[00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:46.340]   I still think that it's impossible to deny that data.
[00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:47.940]   I mean, it was an interesting thing.
[00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:51.420]   I remember when I was a professor back at Harvard,
[00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:55.580]   we were doing this work on sleep and learning.
[00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:57.580]   And they said, and it was sort of published
[00:22:57.580 --> 00:23:00.540]   in these sort of kindly, I don't know how we did it,
[00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:01.820]   but in nice journals.
[00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:05.180]   And they said, okay, based on the media attraction,
[00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:07.420]   would you write an editorial for the Harvard newspaper,
[00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:08.700]   which was called the Harvard Crimson?
[00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:10.260]   And I said, I'd love to.
[00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:12.620]   So at first I thought I'm just going to write a straight
[00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:15.180]   piece about sleep and memory and why it's important.
[00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:17.180]   And I realized, no, there's a better opportunity
[00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:21.180]   because teaching there, and you know this as well as I do,
[00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:23.700]   there is this bizarre system where we teach
[00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:27.020]   for an entire semester and then we end load the semester
[00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:31.220]   full of exams in this stressful two week period.
[00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:33.180]   And what do you think is going to happen?
[00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:36.380]   They're not going to sleep, especially at a time
[00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:38.820]   when they're trying to cram information.
[00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:40.980]   - So especially in college where you don't actually
[00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:43.620]   have the material four weeks before.
[00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:46.620]   So there's not really the option to learn it in advance.
[00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:47.460]   - No.
[00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:49.260]   - Everything's about university to me.
[00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:51.980]   It was about getting a bunch of information
[00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:53.860]   and needing to incorporate it very quickly
[00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:55.620]   and then move to the next item.
[00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:57.020]   - Right, next item, next item.
[00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:59.980]   And then all of a sudden there's this cataclysmic moment
[00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:01.220]   at the end of the semester,
[00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:03.140]   and you are supposed to regurgitate this
[00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:05.540]   by cramming everything into your brain
[00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:08.140]   in this sleepless two week period.
[00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:10.060]   So rather than saying, look,
[00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:11.940]   the students need to change their behavior,
[00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:14.540]   they need to understand this is a problem.
[00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:16.140]   It's not their fault.
[00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:20.260]   I said, it's us as educators and administrators.
[00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:24.260]   We have created a system that forces them
[00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:26.860]   to undergo deliberate sleep deprivation,
[00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:30.620]   and we are educating them amnesic, quite literally.
[00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:35.540]   So I put this editorial out.
[00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:40.540]   It received a rather Baltic, if not Arctic response.
[00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:45.380]   And that was the last editorial I was ever invited
[00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:47.940]   to write for the newspaper.
[00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:51.340]   But you've got to say your piece.
[00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:54.300]   - Well, so, but I'm curious why there's resistance
[00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:56.300]   to shifting to later school times
[00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:59.700]   and to improving the conditions for learning
[00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:01.380]   if the goal is to learn.
[00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:03.900]   I mean, tradition dies hard.
[00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:04.820]   Maybe that's why.
[00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:06.980]   I think there's also the idea,
[00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:08.300]   certainly in the medical profession,
[00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:11.140]   that, well, when I was doing my training,
[00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:13.140]   we would pull all-nighters all the time.
[00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:16.140]   And so the idea then is that it's just part
[00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:18.540]   of the self-directed hazing process,
[00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:20.300]   that is getting a degree,
[00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:22.260]   that you're going to be doing a lot of all-nighters
[00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:24.260]   and cramming and things of that sort.
[00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:27.500]   Is that what you think motivates the resistance to change?
[00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:28.340]   - I think so.
[00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:29.180]   I think you've hit all the points.
[00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:33.660]   I think, you know, zeitgeists die one generation at a time,
[00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:37.820]   and we see that resistance certainly there too.
[00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:40.900]   I also think that when you come back
[00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:42.380]   to later school start times,
[00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:47.980]   they have suggested that there is this cost
[00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:49.340]   when they tally it up.
[00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:50.180]   But you made a point,
[00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:51.740]   which is when did they get out of school?
[00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:54.300]   And let's say it's around 4.30.
[00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:56.660]   One of the interesting analyses that was published,
[00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:58.940]   and we latched onto this,
[00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:02.660]   that is this strange bewitching hour
[00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:04.900]   when kids get out of school,
[00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:07.980]   but often their parents are not home to work.
[00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:11.580]   And if you look at the teenage crime rate,
[00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:14.180]   and you look at when those crimes are committed,
[00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:16.620]   it's usually in that bewitching hour
[00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:18.220]   after they get out of school,
[00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:21.100]   but they don't have a home or parents yet
[00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:23.220]   to go to that it's filled.
[00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:25.820]   But by pushing school start times later,
[00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:29.020]   they get out later, they go home.
[00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:31.700]   And if you were to even half that debt
[00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:34.260]   that those crimes cause,
[00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:38.420]   you would easily pay for the education system.
[00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:40.420]   So it's very interesting.
[00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:43.380]   I think that also notion of,
[00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:46.780]   well, we went through it and here I am,
[00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:48.140]   so you can go through it too,
[00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:49.860]   is very prevalent in medicine.
[00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:51.300]   This is another good example.
[00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:55.260]   We and mostly colleagues at mine,
[00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:57.180]   such as Charles Seisler at Harvard,
[00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:58.620]   have really done a great job
[00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:00.740]   at cataloging exactly why we need
[00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:03.220]   to abandon this resident program,
[00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:05.580]   which has a fascinating history, by the way,
[00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:10.620]   which is young residents should be working 30-hour shifts
[00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:13.140]   often without any sleep whatsoever.
[00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:14.620]   And when you look at that data,
[00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:17.420]   residents who are working a 30-hour shift
[00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:20.180]   are going to be almost 460% more likely
[00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:23.300]   to make diagnostic errors in the intensive care unit.
[00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:27.100]   If you have a surgeon and you're getting elective surgery
[00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:32.100]   who's had less than six hours of sleep in the previous 24,
[00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:37.180]   they are almost 70% more likely to cause a surgical error,
[00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:41.900]   which could result in non-trivial consequences.
[00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:44.700]   And then the irony is that when young residents
[00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:48.300]   after a 30-hour shift get back into their car
[00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:50.540]   at the end of the shift and drive home,
[00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:53.580]   there is 168% increased risk
[00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:55.340]   that they get into a car accident
[00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:59.460]   and then end up back in the ER from where they just came,
[00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:02.340]   but now as a patient rather than a physician.
[00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:05.340]   And you think, what are we doing?
[00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:07.780]   Charles Seisler, I think, has described,
[00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:12.140]   they provided this evidence to the council.
[00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:15.380]   And at first they just, I think the idea was,
[00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:17.460]   look, our minds are made up,
[00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:19.140]   don't confuse me with the data.
[00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:23.100]   And when you appeal on the empathetic basis,
[00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:25.940]   but it wasn't well-received.
[00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:28.020]   So then if you go back and you say,
[00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:29.900]   no, I'm going to give you a different argument.
[00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:31.940]   If you look at the cost of malpractice
[00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:34.140]   caused by insufficient sleep,
[00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:36.660]   and if you get the administrators into the room,
[00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:38.940]   all of a sudden the schedules change.
[00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:40.740]   So then based on that data,
[00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:43.380]   there was a policy that you couldn't work any longer
[00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:46.460]   than I think it was a 16 hour continuous shift.
[00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:49.940]   The problem was that they only said
[00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:52.820]   that that was apparent for the first year residents
[00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:54.460]   and not the remaining years.
[00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:56.220]   And the question was, well, why?
[00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:58.060]   I said, well, the data that you showed us,
[00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:00.940]   you only collected in first year residents.
[00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:03.380]   As if something magical was going to happen
[00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:05.220]   when you become a second year resident
[00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:08.580]   and you don this Teflon coat of immunity
[00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:09.820]   against sleep deprivation.
[00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:11.660]   - Well, if anything, it would compound and get worse.
[00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:16.660]   So it seems to me that there's like zero question
[00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:22.460]   that getting adequate sleep is good for learning,
[00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:23.620]   but when the stakes,
[00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:26.180]   when it's high risk, high consequences scenarios,
[00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:27.660]   or even high consequences scenarios,
[00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:31.460]   like a medical situation,
[00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:33.620]   just seems like it should almost come down
[00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:34.940]   to legal liability.
[00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:36.020]   - Yeah.
[00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:37.300]   - I'd like to take a brief break
[00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:39.660]   and acknowledge our sponsor, AG1.
[00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:42.180]   AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:43.820]   that also contains adaptogens
[00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:45.260]   and is designed to meet
[00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:47.460]   all of your foundational nutritional needs.
[00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:49.580]   By now, I'm sure you've all heard me say
[00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:51.780]   that I've been taking AG1 since 2012.
[00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:53.620]   And indeed that is true.
[00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:56.900]   Now, of course I do consume regular whole foods every day.
[00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:59.740]   I strive to get those foods mostly from unprocessed
[00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:01.620]   or minimally processed sources.
[00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:04.100]   However, I do find it hard to get enough servings
[00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:05.820]   of fruits and vegetables each day.
[00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:08.180]   So with AG1, I ensure that I get enough
[00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:10.540]   of the vitamins, minerals, prebiotic fiber,
[00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:12.900]   and other things typically found in fruits or vegetables.
[00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:14.260]   And of course, I still make sure
[00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:15.580]   to eat fruits and vegetables.
[00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:17.780]   And in that way, provide a sort of insurance
[00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:19.380]   that I'm getting enough of what I need.
[00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:20.740]   In addition, the adaptogens
[00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:22.900]   and other micronutrients in AG1
[00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:24.420]   really help buffer against stress
[00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:26.580]   and ensure that the cells and organs and tissues
[00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:28.980]   of my body are getting the things they need.
[00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:29.820]   People often ask me
[00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:31.740]   that if they were gonna take just one supplement,
[00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:32.980]   what that supplement should be.
[00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:35.100]   And I always answer AG1.
[00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:36.660]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:39.580]   you can go to drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:40.980]   to claim a special offer.
[00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:42.660]   You'll get five free travel packs
[00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:45.220]   plus a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:49.020]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman.
[00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:54.020]   So are the errors of sleep deprivation in these scenarios,
[00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:58.300]   both in students and medical professionals,
[00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:02.180]   are they due to errors in memory per se?
[00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:04.540]   I mean, 'cause you can imagine all sorts of errors.
[00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:06.900]   So with the surgeon, they like cut the wrong thing
[00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:07.860]   or they cut too far,
[00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:11.060]   the margin on the surgical side is too big, et cetera.
[00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:13.580]   But since we're talking about learning and memory
[00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:16.260]   and its relationship to sleep,
[00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:18.980]   is it that people are forgetting what they did?
[00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:20.500]   Are they forgetting what they didn't do?
[00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:23.940]   I mean, or is it a deficit in motor skills
[00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:25.100]   or all of the above?
[00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:27.540]   - It's all of the above plus,
[00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:29.180]   which is that learning and memory,
[00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:31.860]   your recollection of both what you did
[00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:33.460]   or what you need to do
[00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:35.380]   or what you should do based on your training
[00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:36.500]   is going to be compromised
[00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:38.260]   because your recall of that information,
[00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:40.460]   it turns out is also compromised.
[00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:42.540]   But it's also decision-making too,
[00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:44.940]   that what we know is that your frontal lobe
[00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:48.060]   is especially sensitive to a lack of sleep.
[00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:49.140]   And it's that frontal lobe
[00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:51.700]   that really takes complex situations,
[00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:53.780]   distills them down and comes up
[00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:56.860]   with the correct output scenario of decisions
[00:31:56.860 --> 00:31:58.180]   that you need to make.
[00:31:58.180 --> 00:32:00.940]   Not so much when you're sleep deprived.
[00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:05.940]   - So how should I establish the proper neural milieu
[00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:08.700]   for learning by sleeping prior?
[00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:09.980]   Should I make sure that I,
[00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:10.940]   I mean, in an ideal world,
[00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:13.300]   I get an excellent night's sleep for the,
[00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:15.380]   you know, every day of my life
[00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:17.540]   leading up to a bout of learning.
[00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:18.940]   And here I'm referring to a bout of learning
[00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:20.540]   as being exposed to new material,
[00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:24.460]   but life happens.
[00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:28.020]   So if I know that tomorrow I'm going to take a class
[00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:32.460]   in something, or I'm going to need to perform a skill
[00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:34.380]   that it's pretty nascent skill for me,
[00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:36.460]   I've only learned it recently.
[00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:38.180]   What should I do the night before?
[00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:42.620]   - I would say, think about what you can get
[00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:46.100]   in terms of your sleep under current conditions
[00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:51.100]   and understand that that is staying awake
[00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:55.580]   and foregoing sleep is not the right equation
[00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:57.020]   that you may think.
[00:32:57.020 --> 00:33:00.260]   In other words, think of sleep that night
[00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:02.740]   as an investment in tomorrow
[00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:06.780]   rather than a cost opportunity of now or today.
[00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:10.220]   That would be the message I think for learning and memory.
[00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:13.300]   Some people will say logically and rationally,
[00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:15.580]   well, but if I stay awake,
[00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:17.180]   I can at least be learning
[00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:20.180]   and going over that material for many more hours.
[00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:24.780]   So doesn't that compensate for me going to bed?
[00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:26.460]   Let's say I haven't learned it well enough.
[00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:29.180]   Well, surely I should just say,
[00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:31.780]   I should just focus and stay awake
[00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:34.140]   'cause at least then I can just go over the material
[00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:35.540]   time and time and time again.
[00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:38.540]   Doesn't that offset the deficit?
[00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:40.780]   And to a degree it does, we did that study.
[00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:43.900]   But what was really interesting is that the next day
[00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:46.860]   were you able to at least learn
[00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:49.700]   and recall some of that information to a degree?
[00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:51.220]   Yes, you were.
[00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:53.260]   And the more that you kept going over it,
[00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:55.820]   the better you performed
[00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:57.860]   even when you were not getting sufficient sleep.
[00:33:57.860 --> 00:33:59.540]   But then we did something interesting.
[00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:00.700]   We then brought them back.
[00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:02.940]   We haven't published this data, I should do.
[00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:05.780]   We brought them back a month later
[00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:08.100]   and then we tested them again.
[00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:11.340]   And what you find is that the group that slept
[00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:14.620]   was far better able to have retained
[00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:17.100]   and remember that information.
[00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:20.780]   Whereas the group that did not sleep as much,
[00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:23.980]   they performed much more similar to the group
[00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:26.660]   that got a full night of sleep the next day.
[00:34:26.660 --> 00:34:29.500]   But when you test them a month later,
[00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:32.020]   almost none of that material
[00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:33.740]   is residing in their brain anymore.
[00:34:33.740 --> 00:34:34.580]   - Got it.
[00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:36.340]   So this is the cramming effect.
[00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:37.180]   - That's right.
[00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:41.620]   - Right, and one knows this from teaching university courses
[00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:43.980]   or if they've crammed that you can learn a bunch of material
[00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:46.820]   but then you regurgitate it for the exam
[00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:47.780]   and then it's gone.
[00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:48.620]   - Yeah.
[00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:50.660]   - So it's almost like a,
[00:34:50.660 --> 00:34:52.300]   it just never passes from short-term
[00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:53.900]   to long-term memory essentially.
[00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:54.940]   - That's correct.
[00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:57.020]   And that seems to be in some ways
[00:34:57.020 --> 00:35:00.060]   that's a beautiful description of then what happens next
[00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:00.900]   in the sleep process.
[00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:03.740]   It's not just about sleep before learning.
[00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:05.860]   You then have to sleep after learning
[00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:08.740]   to do exactly what you just described.
[00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:13.060]   - So I have a class in the morning
[00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:17.260]   or I'm going to learn something new the next day afternoon.
[00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:19.300]   My goal presumably should be
[00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:22.180]   to maximize the amount of sleep I get
[00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:25.540]   and to be on the same sleep schedule.
[00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:27.220]   So this gets back to QQRT
[00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:29.580]   that was presented in the first episode,
[00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:32.900]   quantity, quality, regularity, and timing.
[00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:34.780]   And people should refer to that.
[00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:36.380]   - Nothing wrong with your memory, by the way.
[00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:37.580]   - Well, I don't know about that,
[00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:42.580]   but the QQRT formula was described in the first episode.
[00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:46.580]   Let's come up with what I think
[00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:47.860]   is a fairly common scenario.
[00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:51.260]   So I like to go to bed early between eight and 9 p.m.
[00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:52.540]   I discovered this recently,
[00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:53.700]   thanks to conversations with you.
[00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:55.180]   This is clearly what works best for me.
[00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:56.260]   I kind of always intuit it,
[00:35:56.260 --> 00:35:58.940]   but it clearly is what works best.
[00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:01.340]   If I go to bed at 10,
[00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:05.580]   I probably want to wake up sometime around 6 a.m. or 6.30.
[00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:08.860]   And if I go to bed any later than 10.30,
[00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:09.900]   I start running into problems.
[00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:11.140]   I don't feel good the next day,
[00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:13.340]   even if I get sufficient hours of sleep.
[00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:15.420]   So this is the importance of regularity and timing,
[00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:16.620]   keeping things more or less locked
[00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:19.820]   to that 8.30 to 9.30 to bedtime for me,
[00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:21.380]   4.30 to 5.30 wake up time.
[00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:24.660]   That's me, just by way of example.
[00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:26.460]   In an ideal world, therefore,
[00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:28.820]   I would stick to that schedule,
[00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:31.500]   wake up the next day and go do my learning
[00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:33.140]   or my performance of something that I'd learned.
[00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:35.060]   Someone else might have the chronotype,
[00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:36.380]   we're going to bed at 11 p.m.
[00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:40.340]   and waking up at 7.30 a.m. is their preferred schedule.
[00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:44.940]   However, often because of travel, because of courses,
[00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:46.620]   because of life circumstances,
[00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:51.460]   the night before something critical that we need to learn
[00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:55.420]   or to perform some critical task, physical or cognitive,
[00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:58.100]   the sleep the night before is disrupted in some way,
[00:36:58.100 --> 00:37:01.300]   either by virtue of timing or quantity.
[00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:03.460]   And then of course, by extension, regularity.
[00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:06.940]   So is there anything that we can do
[00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:09.260]   heading into a bout of learning,
[00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:11.740]   meaning the night preceding that bout of learning
[00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:15.780]   that can kind of provide a buffer
[00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:18.700]   or set us up for the best possible learning scenario
[00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:22.060]   if we're not able to stick to our perfect schedule?
[00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:23.620]   - I think there may be two things.
[00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:26.980]   There's been a little bit of work that's been done
[00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:30.380]   to suggest that caffeine may actually enhance
[00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:34.060]   the hippocampus, this memory encoding structure
[00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:37.020]   and boost its ability to encode.
[00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:39.980]   Now, what they haven't yet done is the study
[00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:42.260]   where you sleep deprive someone,
[00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:44.540]   then you give them caffeine the next day,
[00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:47.020]   and then you have them try to learn and ask,
[00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:50.060]   can caffeine by way of its effect on the hippocampus
[00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:52.580]   rescue and restore
[00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:55.740]   what would otherwise be an encoding deficit?
[00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:57.700]   Now, that is entirely possible.
[00:37:57.700 --> 00:37:59.460]   I think it's a fascinating question.
[00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:03.500]   By how much, we don't know.
[00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:05.700]   But if it doesn't, it's equally likely
[00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:10.260]   that the hippocampus by way of being sleep deprived
[00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:13.380]   is not receptive to the benefit of caffeine
[00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:15.300]   under conditions of sleep deprivation.
[00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:17.460]   And I told you in the rat studies,
[00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:19.380]   when those rats were deprived,
[00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:22.620]   the hippocampus once again became stubborn
[00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:25.300]   in its ability to form new synapses.
[00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:27.420]   And it may be that it's equally stubborn
[00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:30.460]   to receive the normal benefit of caffeine
[00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:32.420]   when you are sleep rested.
[00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:34.580]   But I would love to do that study.
[00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:35.780]   The second is to then say,
[00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:37.780]   well, if I have the choice
[00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:40.500]   of when I'm going to be learning during the day,
[00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:42.140]   let's say that you've had a bad night of sleep
[00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:43.700]   or you just had a short night of sleep,
[00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:46.060]   non-negotiable, couldn't do anything about it.
[00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:49.300]   And the next day I've got to cram in some information.
[00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:52.500]   I would say, think about your chronotype
[00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:54.260]   and think about when you are
[00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:56.820]   at your best operating temperature.
[00:38:56.820 --> 00:39:01.180]   So your scenario, let's say going to bed at nine,
[00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:03.340]   waking up at 4.30, five,
[00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:07.540]   your peak is probably going to be maybe 10, 11 o'clock
[00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:09.060]   in the morning where your biology
[00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:13.300]   and your circadian rhythm is on its almost crescendo peak.
[00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:18.180]   At that point, we know for circadian influences on learning,
[00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:20.700]   and this is independent of sleep influences on learning,
[00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:21.940]   that's where things are better.
[00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:23.620]   Now, for me, you actually described me,
[00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:27.300]   which is I'm a kind of an 11 to 7.30 type person.
[00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:29.060]   For me, it's probably going to be much closer
[00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:31.620]   to about midday or 1 p.m.
[00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:33.940]   where I feel at my operating peak,
[00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:37.620]   both for physical performance and also mental performance.
[00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:40.860]   So if you've got the choice and you are underslept,
[00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:42.420]   there's nothing you can do about the sleep
[00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:44.180]   that you've lost the night before,
[00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:46.620]   but at least recognize that your circadian rhythm
[00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:50.340]   is going to come to your rescue and help offset that
[00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:52.820]   as long as you time your learning
[00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:56.780]   to that known peak of your circadian rhythm.
[00:39:56.780 --> 00:39:57.860]   Does that help a little bit?
[00:39:57.860 --> 00:39:59.700]   - Yes, that makes good sense.
[00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:03.020]   So the idea gets us back to something
[00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:04.740]   you described in previous episodes,
[00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:06.660]   which is that you have this sleep pressure
[00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:08.740]   due to the buildup of the molecule adenosine,
[00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:10.580]   which the longer we're awake,
[00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:12.700]   the more adenosine in our nervous system,
[00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:14.180]   which makes us sleepy.
[00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:19.180]   But separate from that, there's this circadian circadia,
[00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:21.620]   about 24-hour rhythm, right,
[00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:26.820]   that causes fairly dramatic shifts
[00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:29.260]   in wakefulness and sleepiness,
[00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:31.180]   independent of the adenosine signal.
[00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:33.420]   Now, sometimes the two signals overlap,
[00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:35.260]   so that late in the evening, for instance,
[00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:37.060]   we have a lot of adenosine, we've been up all day,
[00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:38.380]   and our circadian rhythm is such
[00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:40.460]   that our alertness is starting to diminish,
[00:40:40.460 --> 00:40:41.300]   so they're aligned.
[00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:42.220]   And in the early part of the day,
[00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:43.540]   assuming everything is normal,
[00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:45.140]   the adenosine levels are low
[00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:46.420]   because we slept well the night before,
[00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:49.780]   and our circadian rhythm is on the upswing, so to speak,
[00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:52.380]   and we are alert.
[00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:54.460]   So if I understand correctly,
[00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:56.900]   the goal is to, of course,
[00:40:56.900 --> 00:40:59.180]   maximize the quality, quantity, regularity,
[00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:01.300]   and timing of sleep, QQRT,
[00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:04.220]   but that in the absence of the ability
[00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:07.660]   to really anchor any one of those things
[00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:11.100]   to 10 out of 10, A-plus performance,
[00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:13.940]   if one knows that, okay, typically around,
[00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:16.500]   between 10 a.m. and noon is when I'm at my sharpest,
[00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:19.060]   that would be the time to be exposed to new material,
[00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:20.380]   or ideally take an exam,
[00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:22.580]   if one can control that sort of thing.
[00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:24.340]   And then perhaps in the afternoon,
[00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:29.340]   there's another opportunity after the postprandial dip.
[00:41:29.340 --> 00:41:30.620]   - That's right.
[00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:32.740]   - But before the postprandial dip,
[00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:34.060]   sometime between one and four p.m.,
[00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:35.940]   usually lasting about an hour to 90 minutes,
[00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:37.500]   this is a natural dip in energy,
[00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:42.000]   but then after that is another opportunity to learn.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.940]   Sure, there'll be a lot of adenosine in one system
[00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:46.660]   'cause you've been up a long time,
[00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:52.540]   but the circadian system is on its sort of upswing again
[00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:55.100]   before the downswing that occurs in the evening.
[00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:55.940]   Is that right?
[00:41:55.940 --> 00:41:58.460]   - That's right, so you've got two opportunities.
[00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:00.220]   And by the way, it's strange, you were to ask,
[00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:02.380]   if you look at the circadian rhythm,
[00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:04.460]   right before sort of bedtime,
[00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:06.900]   there is this sort of strange little blip,
[00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:11.860]   this peak that folks back at Harvard have discovered.
[00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:14.660]   And you think, well, why would my circadian system,
[00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:17.220]   which needs to really ratchet down
[00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:20.120]   for us to get to sleep well,
[00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:24.260]   why would it have this little jag upwards
[00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:27.700]   in the evening hours, right before we need to sleep,
[00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:30.940]   and it then drops precipitously?
[00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:34.860]   Makes no sense until you think about evolution,
[00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:38.460]   because after foraging for food during the day,
[00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:41.860]   what you need is this final spurt
[00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:46.860]   to get you home safely to your nest or to your home.
[00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:48.500]   - To batten down the hatches.
[00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:51.640]   - Exactly, so there is this beautiful little
[00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:54.840]   built-in circadian upswing to say,
[00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:56.840]   okay, I know you're returning to home.
[00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:59.120]   This is probably a time when there's some
[00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:01.280]   maybe potential threat to you.
[00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:03.640]   I'm gonna just boost your alertness very quickly.
[00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:07.120]   So you travel home safely, good to go, great.
[00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:09.440]   And now I start my downswing.
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:11.000]   - I think this is a really important thing
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.160]   for people to know about.
[00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:16.360]   I'm familiar with the data, although just in top contour,
[00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:18.500]   but the idea here, as I understand it,
[00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:21.940]   is that many people will feel like,
[00:43:21.940 --> 00:43:24.780]   okay, around 6 p.m., 6.30, they're getting sleepy,
[00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:27.940]   7.30, 8.00 p.m., and then they wanna get to bed at 10.30,
[00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:31.520]   and suddenly, for them, based on their chronotype,
[00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:33.180]   around 9.00 p.m., they're wide awake.
[00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:34.980]   - Second wind. - Right, the second wind,
[00:43:34.980 --> 00:43:38.160]   and they're like, oh no, I need to sleep tonight.
[00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:41.320]   Now, maybe it's the case that they would be better off
[00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:44.080]   going to bed far earlier and waking up earlier
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:46.240]   the next morning, but in many cases,
[00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:50.020]   it's just that transient 45 to 60, you know,
[00:43:50.020 --> 00:43:53.980]   70-minute window of increased alertness.
[00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:56.020]   - That's right. - This kind of uptick
[00:43:56.020 --> 00:43:58.020]   in the circadian alertness system.
[00:43:58.020 --> 00:44:00.980]   - Yeah, this too shall pass, and then also,
[00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:02.780]   just set yourself up for success,
[00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:04.620]   and we discussed a little bit about the methods
[00:44:04.620 --> 00:44:08.300]   of really ratcheting things down, dimming down the lights,
[00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:09.960]   having a to-bed alarm.
[00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:13.420]   These types of things will just gradually back you off,
[00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:15.980]   and after that second wind comes,
[00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:20.440]   give you the greatest ability to decline physiologically,
[00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:23.540]   which then permits this beautiful thing called sleep
[00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:25.280]   to come in its place.
[00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:27.660]   - Well, speaking of sleep post-learning,
[00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:32.020]   what is the role of sleep that follows about learning?
[00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:33.760]   And here, again, we wanna define learning
[00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:37.240]   as the exposure to novel information
[00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:38.460]   that one is trying to encode,
[00:44:38.460 --> 00:44:40.540]   either cognitive information, motor information,
[00:44:40.540 --> 00:44:42.320]   or a combination of the two.
[00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:47.460]   And I say that because learning, a.k.a. neuroplasticity,
[00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:48.740]   has many different stages.
[00:44:48.740 --> 00:44:51.020]   It's a process, not an event.
[00:44:51.020 --> 00:44:53.400]   So, let's say that earlier in the day,
[00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:55.980]   I took a dance class, Lord knows I need one,
[00:44:55.980 --> 00:44:57.780]   or-- - You and I both.
[00:44:57.780 --> 00:44:59.020]   - Or a musical lesson,
[00:44:59.020 --> 00:45:01.280]   or was exposed to some interesting information,
[00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:03.020]   who knows, maybe on a podcast,
[00:45:03.020 --> 00:45:05.460]   and I was trying to engage in that information
[00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:10.000]   and pay attention, and then that night, I planned to sleep,
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:11.820]   or perhaps one could take a nap
[00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:13.940]   after this bout of learning.
[00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:19.660]   How close to the learning episode,
[00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:22.540]   about, as I'm calling it, does the sleep have to arrive
[00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:24.220]   in order for sleep to maximize
[00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:26.780]   the amount of learning that occurs?
[00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:28.680]   - It's a very good question, which is,
[00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:33.180]   what would happen if I were to be learning information
[00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:37.060]   and I'm listening to this odd British gentleman,
[00:45:37.060 --> 00:45:39.980]   should I then immediately dive into bed
[00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:44.180]   so that I maximize the retention of that information?
[00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:46.940]   And the answer is no, don't worry.
[00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:49.780]   I'll come back to why not to worry,
[00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:51.380]   but to your point,
[00:45:51.380 --> 00:45:53.460]   not only do you need sleep before learning,
[00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:55.300]   as we've been discussing,
[00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:59.820]   but there is something unique and equally necessary of,
[00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:02.020]   and causally necessary, I should say,
[00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:05.380]   for sleep after learning, but it does something different.
[00:46:05.380 --> 00:46:07.720]   Sleep before learning gets your brain ready
[00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:10.460]   to lay down those new memory traces.
[00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:12.660]   After you've imprinted them into the brain,
[00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:15.580]   sleep after learning then takes those
[00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:20.580]   freshly minted memories and then it strengthens them.
[00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:22.460]   Essentially, it's almost like sleep will hit
[00:46:22.460 --> 00:46:25.260]   the save button on those new memories
[00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:27.060]   so that you don't forget.
[00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:30.220]   So in other words, sleep is future-proofing
[00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:32.820]   that information within your brain
[00:46:32.820 --> 00:46:34.580]   so that you don't forget.
[00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:37.800]   And then the question, and we've been able to,
[00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:39.940]   and we and many others have replicated this,
[00:46:39.940 --> 00:46:41.640]   in fact, it's nothing new.
[00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:43.280]   If you look at the literature
[00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:46.760]   on this sleep after learning gig,
[00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:52.360]   it goes back, as best we can tell, to 1929.
[00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:55.160]   Although, I'll argue with that in a second,
[00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:57.880]   but two researchers, Jenkins and Dallenbach,
[00:46:57.880 --> 00:47:00.000]   did a landmark study.
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:01.880]   They had participants learn
[00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:04.240]   a whole bunch of nonsense syllables
[00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:07.260]   and they had them learn them over and over and over again
[00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:09.120]   and gradually they got better.
[00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:11.400]   And then they started to test them
[00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:13.200]   across an eight-hour period.
[00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:16.040]   They tested them two hours later, four hours later,
[00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:18.540]   six hours later, and eight hours later.
[00:47:18.540 --> 00:47:22.380]   The only difference is that in one of those testing sessions
[00:47:22.380 --> 00:47:25.140]   that two hours, four hours, six hours, eight hours
[00:47:25.140 --> 00:47:27.100]   was across a waking day.
[00:47:27.100 --> 00:47:30.380]   In the other, they had them learn that information
[00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:32.380]   to near perfection before sleep,
[00:47:32.380 --> 00:47:34.140]   just as they did in the waking group,
[00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:36.900]   but now they woke them up after two hours and tested them,
[00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:38.280]   after four hours and tested them,
[00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:40.260]   just six hours, and then again,
[00:47:40.260 --> 00:47:42.740]   when they woke up in the morning, eight hours later.
[00:47:42.740 --> 00:47:44.300]   And what they found is that in those people
[00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:47.180]   who stayed awake after learning,
[00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:50.720]   there was essentially just catastrophic forgetting.
[00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:53.180]   The amount of information, two hours, four hours,
[00:47:53.180 --> 00:47:57.000]   six hours, eight hours later, just declined dramatically.
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:00.140]   But when they repeated that in the same individuals
[00:48:00.140 --> 00:48:02.980]   after learning things to the same degree,
[00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:04.500]   two hours, four hours later,
[00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:06.020]   memory was starting to decline.
[00:48:06.020 --> 00:48:10.300]   But after about two and a half, three hours of being asleep,
[00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:13.940]   all of a sudden, sleep had fixated those memories
[00:48:13.940 --> 00:48:18.620]   almost like an animal that's been trapped in ember
[00:48:18.620 --> 00:48:21.020]   and set in ember like a fossil.
[00:48:21.020 --> 00:48:23.660]   And then those memories just would not decay any further
[00:48:23.660 --> 00:48:24.780]   and you retained them.
[00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:27.500]   What was stunning about that study
[00:48:27.500 --> 00:48:31.920]   is it has been replicated time and time again.
[00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:33.680]   That's not the surprising part.
[00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:35.900]   The surprising part is that in that study,
[00:48:35.900 --> 00:48:38.540]   they tested a vast number of subjects.
[00:48:38.540 --> 00:48:41.920]   In fact, a sum total of two participants.
[00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:43.940]   (laughs)
[00:48:43.940 --> 00:48:47.180]   But what's stunning is that that finding has gone
[00:48:47.180 --> 00:48:49.420]   and been replicated time and time again.
[00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:52.060]   So that demonstrated to us
[00:48:52.060 --> 00:48:54.700]   that there's something special about sleep
[00:48:54.700 --> 00:48:57.780]   that is concretizing, almost literally,
[00:48:57.780 --> 00:49:01.140]   like taking things and setting it in concrete.
[00:49:01.140 --> 00:49:05.100]   And then the question became, again, mechanistically, how?
[00:49:05.100 --> 00:49:06.100]   How is it?
[00:49:06.100 --> 00:49:07.780]   And it's important to understand mechanism
[00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:10.600]   because it has ramifications for diseases and medicine.
[00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:14.940]   How is sleep doing this fantastic saving of memories?
[00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:16.940]   And we now have at least two
[00:49:16.940 --> 00:49:19.580]   non-mutually exclusive mechanisms.
[00:49:19.580 --> 00:49:22.340]   So in other words, both seem to occur.
[00:49:22.340 --> 00:49:25.860]   The first is what we call memory translocation.
[00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:31.400]   Sleep and particularly what we found for fact-based memories.
[00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:32.440]   And I should note, by the way,
[00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:36.680]   that this story of sleep after learning is a two-part
[00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:39.500]   or it runs in two different narratives.
[00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:43.920]   One is sleep after learning for fact-based memory,
[00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:46.920]   what we describe as declarative memory.
[00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:50.280]   And you've done a fantastic previous episode
[00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:52.120]   on working memory and describe
[00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:54.560]   all of these different types of memory.
[00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:57.380]   So one story line has been sleep after learning
[00:49:57.380 --> 00:49:58.240]   for fact-based memory.
[00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:01.120]   But the other, which is equally interesting,
[00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:05.600]   is sleep for non-declarative or procedural skill memory.
[00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:08.200]   In other words, what we think of as motor memory.
[00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:10.660]   But I'll come back to motor memory in a second.
[00:50:10.660 --> 00:50:15.360]   What we then found for this sleep and textbook-like memory
[00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:16.600]   is that there are two mechanisms.
[00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:18.120]   The first, translocation.
[00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:21.720]   And here, what we found is that it's deep non-REM sleep
[00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:23.800]   for fact-based memories.
[00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:27.140]   And it's those big, slow, powerful brainwaves
[00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:29.120]   that we spoke about in the first episode,
[00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:31.240]   combined with those sleep spindles
[00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:34.080]   that ride on top of them almost like a surfer
[00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:36.360]   on a huge amplitude wave.
[00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:41.440]   And it's the combination of those two brainwaves
[00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:45.200]   that acts like a file transfer mechanism.
[00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:47.440]   And it moves and shifts memories
[00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:51.160]   from a short-term vulnerable reservoir, the hippocampus,
[00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:54.000]   to the more permanent long-term storage site,
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:55.800]   the cortex in the brain,
[00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:59.240]   and therefore protecting them and making them safe.
[00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:01.520]   So that's one mechanism,
[00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:04.320]   is the shifting of memories around the brain
[00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:06.120]   and through different storage sites
[00:51:06.120 --> 00:51:07.560]   from short-term to long-term.
[00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:11.880]   The second, I think, is perhaps even more fascinating.
[00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:15.000]   It's called memory replay.
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:18.720]   And this was discovered back in the probably 1990s.
[00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:21.400]   Bruce McNaughton at the University of Arizona
[00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:24.160]   working with a young Matt Wilson, who not,
[00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:27.240]   I'm Matt Walker, he's Matt Wilson at MIT now.
[00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:28.680]   They were looking at rats
[00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:32.000]   and they were looking at how rats learn a maze.
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.320]   And they had these electrodes
[00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:38.200]   in these hippocampal brain regions,
[00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:41.440]   these memory-related regions that we've been discussing.
[00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:45.240]   And they were listening to the individual firing patterns
[00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:47.520]   of those memory cells in the hippocampus
[00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:49.080]   as they were running around the maze.
[00:51:49.080 --> 00:51:51.400]   And sure enough, as they ran around the maze,
[00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:53.200]   statistically, you would build up
[00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:55.960]   what looked like the signature pattern of learning.
[00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:57.800]   So think about those neurons,
[00:51:57.800 --> 00:52:00.240]   that they each had a special tone to them.
[00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:02.040]   And as the rat is running around the maze,
[00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:03.840]   you can hear the signature of learning.
[00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:07.280]   Ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-bum, ba-ba-ba-bum, ba-ba-ba-bum.
[00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:09.000]   I just went over and over again.
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:10.880]   But then they did something clever.
[00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:14.360]   When the rats went to sleep after learning,
[00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:15.360]   they kept listening.
[00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:17.200]   What did they hear?
[00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:18.920]   They didn't just hear noise.
[00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:22.240]   They heard that same memory signature replayed.
[00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:27.040]   However, it wasn't replayed at the same speed.
[00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:32.040]   It was replayed somewhere between 10 to 20 times faster.
[00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:35.520]   So now, all of a sudden, instead of hearing ba-ba-ba-bum,
[00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:39.800]   ba-ba-ba-bum, you heard brum, brum, brum, brum, brum, brum,
[00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:41.720]   just going over and over again.
[00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:44.920]   And what we've learned is that this replay of memories
[00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:46.720]   for that type of information.
[00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:49.560]   Now, for rats, that their version, essentially,
[00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:52.480]   of that spatial navigation is their version
[00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:53.560]   of fact-based memory.
[00:52:53.560 --> 00:52:55.160]   And I won't go into detail, but-
[00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:58.040]   - Yeah, 'cause navigating novel environments
[00:52:58.040 --> 00:53:01.040]   is especially important for all species,
[00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:03.760]   but rodents, to know where they cached food,
[00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:05.600]   where escapes are, and things of that sort.
[00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:07.960]   - Yeah, perhaps even more so than us humans,
[00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:09.440]   that locational memory is necessary.
[00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:11.080]   - And nowadays, there's Google Maps,
[00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:12.640]   and Uber, and things of that sort.
[00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:16.000]   But in the old days, as it were, I recall,
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:18.560]   the London taxi drivers were considered
[00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:23.560]   the world heavyweight champions of memory.
[00:53:23.560 --> 00:53:27.080]   And there were some decent brain imaging studies
[00:53:27.080 --> 00:53:29.200]   of their hippocampi.
[00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:31.360]   And indeed, they have amazing spatial memory
[00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:33.200]   of the city of London.
[00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:36.200]   Now, that's probably changed because of Google Maps.
[00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:39.680]   There's no need to rely on internal memory stores
[00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:40.520]   when you have-
[00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:42.320]   - No, you still actually, there's still a...
[00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:45.440]   Now, you can drive these rideshare apps,
[00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:46.880]   but for London taxi drivers,
[00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:47.920]   they still have to go through,
[00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:49.640]   in some ways, it's almost like a hazing,
[00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:51.600]   it's called the knowledge.
[00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:54.320]   And if you are visiting London,
[00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:56.040]   you will see these strange guys
[00:53:56.040 --> 00:53:58.200]   who are going around on mopeds,
[00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:01.960]   and they just have this huge kind of map in front of them.
[00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:03.880]   And they are doing the knowledge,
[00:54:03.880 --> 00:54:06.120]   which is that they are learning exquisitely
[00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:08.560]   the entire roadmap of London.
[00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:10.520]   And what they found in those studies
[00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:13.720]   was that the size of the hippocampus,
[00:54:13.720 --> 00:54:16.280]   this memory structure related to fact-based memories
[00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:17.680]   and also spatial memories,
[00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:21.800]   was significantly larger in cab drivers
[00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:24.120]   than it was in matched controls.
[00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:24.960]   Now, you could say, well,
[00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:27.040]   this is a self-selecting process
[00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:31.320]   that people who already have large hippocampi,
[00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:32.720]   as we would say,
[00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:34.000]   they're just going to be the people
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:37.120]   who can do the knowledge well and pass, as it were.
[00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:39.920]   But what they also found was that a correlation,
[00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:42.560]   the longer that you've been doing the knowledge
[00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:44.600]   and being a taxi driver,
[00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:46.440]   the bigger and bigger your hippocampus,
[00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:48.640]   so it's time on task.
[00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:52.440]   So coming back to the rats and this spatial learning,
[00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:55.440]   it's almost as though sleep after learning
[00:54:55.440 --> 00:54:57.280]   is taking that memory trace,
[00:54:57.280 --> 00:55:00.520]   and it's like etching into a glass surface.
[00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:04.000]   You just go over that memory circuit over and over again,
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:06.680]   and you're strengthening that memory circuit.
[00:55:06.680 --> 00:55:10.400]   What was also fascinating, however,
[00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:12.760]   I'm telling you that it's during non-REM sleep
[00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:15.680]   that you do all of this memory replay.
[00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:18.280]   And certainly what we found is that for textbook memory,
[00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:19.640]   it's deep non-REM sleep.
[00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:21.720]   That's the important stage of sleep.
[00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:25.120]   But Matt Wilson published at MIT an interesting study
[00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:27.000]   looking at REM sleep.
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:30.400]   What happens to the memory trace in REM sleep?
[00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:34.480]   And REM sleep, which we know is associated with dreaming,
[00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:38.040]   that the memory replay didn't slow back down
[00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:39.800]   to normal waking speed.
[00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:44.800]   It slowed down even further to 0.5 times
[00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:46.400]   relative to waking speed.
[00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:49.840]   So the waking speed versus the dreaming speed.
[00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:52.600]   In dreaming, sort of in REM sleep, I should say,
[00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:54.200]   because we don't know if rats dream or not,
[00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:59.200]   but in REM sleep, things had slowed down by essentially 50%.
[00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:01.320]   And this comes back to our conversation
[00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:04.640]   in a previous episode that we had about time.
[00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:05.800]   And you and I were discussing
[00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:07.360]   how there's this strange phenomenon
[00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:11.320]   where you are woken up by your alarm and you're in a dream
[00:56:11.320 --> 00:56:13.560]   and you have a snooze button that lasts five minutes.
[00:56:13.560 --> 00:56:15.440]   You hit the snooze button, you go back to sleep
[00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:17.040]   and you feel as though you've been dreaming
[00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:20.440]   for 10 minutes, 15 minutes.
[00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:22.520]   But it's been five minutes in the real world,
[00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:25.480]   but time has slowed down, time has dilated.
[00:56:25.480 --> 00:56:29.000]   It's almost like a concertina that's stretched out.
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:31.160]   And all of a sudden we were finding in,
[00:56:31.160 --> 00:56:33.160]   or Matt Wilson, because we don't do animal research,
[00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:38.160]   was finding that this replay was slowed down by 50%.
[00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:42.240]   So I always wonder whether or not there is neuronal evidence
[00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:46.880]   that helps us explain why dreams seem to pack more time,
[00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:50.520]   despite being in real world time, a shorter amount.
[00:56:50.520 --> 00:56:52.600]   Absolutely fascinating.
[00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:57.200]   - Yeah, I have to imagine that rats dream
[00:56:57.200 --> 00:56:59.320]   and dogs dream and other animals dream.
[00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:00.760]   I mean, why wouldn't they?
[00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:05.160]   If all the components of REM sleep
[00:57:05.160 --> 00:57:08.320]   that are expressed in humans appear in these animals
[00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:12.040]   and vice versa, you imagine it almost has to be the case.
[00:57:12.040 --> 00:57:12.880]   - It does.
[00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:15.120]   And I think there is some interesting supportive evidence
[00:57:15.120 --> 00:57:16.200]   that you can argue.
[00:57:16.200 --> 00:57:20.440]   There is a sleep disorder that we understood in humans first
[00:57:20.440 --> 00:57:23.280]   called rapid eye movement disorder
[00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:26.320]   or REM sleep behavioral disorder.
[00:57:26.320 --> 00:57:27.880]   And in the first episode,
[00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:31.400]   we said that one of the fascinating features of REM sleep,
[00:57:31.400 --> 00:57:34.120]   which is when we principally dream,
[00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:37.520]   is that your brain and specifically your brainstem
[00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:41.640]   paralyzes your body so that your mind can dream safely.
[00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:43.280]   So you're shut down
[00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:48.280]   into this motor paralysis incarceration, rightly so.
[00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:52.560]   But what also happens is that as we get older
[00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:54.840]   and it seems to be particularly more so in men
[00:57:54.840 --> 00:57:56.840]   than in women, but it can be both.
[00:57:56.840 --> 00:57:58.200]   Once we get past our fifties,
[00:57:58.200 --> 00:57:59.960]   there's a higher likelihood
[00:57:59.960 --> 00:58:04.000]   that that mechanism starts to degrade
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:06.240]   and you can start to act out your dreams.
[00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:08.840]   Now, this is not sleep walking or sleep talking.
[00:58:08.840 --> 00:58:12.360]   That actually comes from deep non-REM sleep.
[00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:14.760]   And there, what happens is that there is a trigger,
[00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:17.320]   an awakening, either a brain response,
[00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:20.440]   almost like a stress response that wakes the brain up
[00:58:20.440 --> 00:58:22.760]   and you're in the deepest stages of sleep.
[00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:26.280]   And you are trying to get forced back up to wakefulness.
[00:58:26.280 --> 00:58:29.000]   So back to that analogy of going from the basement
[00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:30.880]   to the penthouse.
[00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:32.720]   And instead you just get locked
[00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:35.080]   into this mixed state of consciousness.
[00:58:35.080 --> 00:58:37.680]   And as a consequence,
[00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:41.280]   you start to enact very rote, basic behaviors.
[00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:43.480]   You'll go over to the refrigerator, open the door,
[00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:45.800]   close the door, pick up a glass, put it to your mouth,
[00:58:45.800 --> 00:58:47.480]   put it back down.
[00:58:47.480 --> 00:58:49.160]   And if you wake someone up,
[00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:52.840]   which you shouldn't necessarily do unless there's harm,
[00:58:52.840 --> 00:58:55.440]   and ask them, what was going through your mind
[00:58:55.440 --> 00:58:56.640]   just a few minutes ago?
[00:58:56.640 --> 00:58:58.120]   They'll say nothing.
[00:58:58.120 --> 00:59:00.560]   And the reason is because it wasn't coming from dream sleep,
[00:59:00.560 --> 00:59:02.120]   it was from deep non-REM sleep.
[00:59:02.120 --> 00:59:03.040]   - I see.
[00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:05.480]   - However, there is a very different condition
[00:59:05.480 --> 00:59:09.200]   that sometimes people will mix up as the very same thing,
[00:59:09.200 --> 00:59:10.920]   which is REM sleep behavioral disorder.
[00:59:10.920 --> 00:59:12.400]   And there you're acting out your dreams.
[00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:13.800]   It can be quite violent.
[00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:16.520]   Some people have enacted violence on their partner
[00:59:16.520 --> 00:59:19.240]   and woken up and been absolutely devastated.
[00:59:19.240 --> 00:59:21.400]   I bring this up, however,
[00:59:21.400 --> 00:59:23.880]   because human beings are not the only species
[00:59:23.880 --> 00:59:27.280]   that suffers from REM sleep behavioral disorder.
[00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:29.960]   Dogs suffer from this as well.
[00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:32.000]   And when you see it and you can understand it,
[00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:34.440]   it's very clear, you have electrodes on the head,
[00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:36.080]   they go into this REM sleep state,
[00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:39.400]   and all of a sudden they come out of the paralysis
[00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:43.200]   and they start enacting what very much looks like
[00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:45.800]   a behavior of wakefulness.
[00:59:45.800 --> 00:59:47.360]   It's quite complex.
[00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:50.920]   And at that point, you look at that and you say,
[00:59:50.920 --> 00:59:54.600]   okay, I'm sorry, but that looks very much like dreaming.
[00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:57.760]   Now we can't, of course, ask dogs,
[00:59:57.760 --> 00:59:59.840]   question what was going through your mind.
[00:59:59.840 --> 01:00:01.680]   - You can ask them, but they're not gonna answer.
[01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:03.160]   - But yeah, you can ask them,
[01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:06.440]   but it turns out that the response is less than,
[01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:08.440]   it's just a look to say, give me a treat.
[01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:11.800]   But in science, sometimes if it looks like a duck,
[01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:14.920]   talks like a duck, walks like a duck, maybe it's a duck.
[01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:18.680]   - What about this phenomenon,
[01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:22.360]   which I've experienced before of being asleep,
[01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:24.680]   presumably in rapid eye movement sleep
[01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:26.040]   and being completely paralyzed,
[01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:29.960]   but then waking up and I'm still in paralysis,
[01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:32.600]   but I'm not asleep.
[01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:37.320]   And this was a long time ago, probably the 10th grade,
[01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:41.120]   which for me, I was what, 15 years old, I'm 48 now,
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:44.760]   and was at a party that I fell asleep on the couch.
[01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:48.240]   And goodness, I don't believe in underage drinking,
[01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:49.680]   but there's a possibility
[01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:51.380]   that I might've been inebriated.
[01:00:51.380 --> 01:00:52.920]   - It's just a possibility.
[01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:57.920]   - Kids, parents, I actively dissuade young people
[01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:00.980]   from drinking and many older people from drinking,
[01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:03.760]   but yeah, I started drinking far too young.
[01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:06.520]   And, but I remember I drank the night before,
[01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:08.120]   I got drunk the night before,
[01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:11.800]   again, something I'm not suggesting or proud of.
[01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:14.920]   I woke up and I was wide awake.
[01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:16.240]   Gosh, I remember this so well.
[01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:18.240]   And I was paralyzed, I could not move.
[01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:19.880]   And it was terrifying.
[01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:23.200]   And then all of a sudden, boom, I could jolt myself awake.
[01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:24.600]   And I was like, oh my goodness.
[01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:28.380]   And it must've been an invasion of that atonia,
[01:01:28.380 --> 01:01:31.720]   that sleep induced paralysis into the waking state.
[01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:34.920]   - So I can explain this and you have,
[01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:39.440]   this is the perfect prototypical situation when we see this.
[01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:41.480]   What you're describing to me is something
[01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:43.520]   that many people listening will have experienced
[01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:46.200]   called REM sleep paralysis.
[01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:48.480]   And it's not necessarily a problem
[01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:51.400]   or a sign of a condition that you need to be worried about.
[01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:52.920]   Although if it's happening frequently,
[01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:55.240]   we can think about that.
[01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:58.000]   What normally happens when we wake up out of REM sleep
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.240]   and REM sleep, as we spoke about in the first episode,
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:02.080]   dominates the second half of the night
[01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:05.040]   and particularly the last quarter of the night.
[01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:06.880]   As you're coming out of REM sleep
[01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:08.240]   and waking up out of REM sleep,
[01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:11.000]   which you've got a 50, 50% chance perhaps,
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.160]   'cause the other state that you're in
[01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:14.360]   is stage two light non-REM.
[01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:15.960]   As you're coming out of REM sleep,
[01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:19.400]   you're regaining consciousness to the external world.
[01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:23.080]   And then normally in lockstep with that perfect lockstep,
[01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:24.680]   if not a little before,
[01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:26.760]   your brain is realizing this
[01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:28.880]   and it's releasing you from the paralysis.
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:31.400]   And we all wake up and we don't even think about it.
[01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:33.880]   I just wake up and I lean over,
[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:36.520]   I turn off the alarm and I get out of bed.
[01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:38.080]   Everything's fine.
[01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:40.040]   Every now and again, however,
[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:45.040]   the waking up and consciousness re-engaging occurs.
[01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:48.080]   However, the brain does not release you
[01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:50.120]   from the REM sleep paralysis.
[01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:51.560]   So at that point,
[01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:54.640]   it's almost like a locked in body phenomenon.
[01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:55.640]   And it's very frightening
[01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:59.120]   because you begin to be aware of your surroundings,
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:02.040]   but you cannot make any voluntary movements.
[01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:02.880]   Because I told you
[01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:05.040]   that the voluntary skeletal muscle system
[01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:07.960]   is impaired by the atonia, the absence of muscle.
[01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:10.080]   You're involuntary, you're still breathing and all that.
[01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:12.480]   But your eyelids turn out to be part
[01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:16.240]   of your voluntary muscle set.
[01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:19.160]   So you can't lift up your eyelids.
[01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:20.880]   And then normally what happens
[01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:24.360]   is that it's associated with a strong sense
[01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:27.360]   of often an intruder, it seems to be.
[01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:30.840]   If you're doing it sort of in bed by yourself at home,
[01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:33.240]   now your context was a little different.
[01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:36.120]   And it turns out that if you look
[01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:38.320]   at these descriptions of sleep paralysis
[01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:41.320]   where you can't wake up, you can't shout out,
[01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:44.000]   you can't move, you have this sense of another presence
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000]   or another being in the room,
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.200]   it adequately explains most,
[01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:51.360]   if not all alien abduction stories.
[01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:54.920]   Because when was the last time you saw a news article
[01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:57.000]   or on the news that someone said,
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:01.200]   okay, today it was very clear that Jimmy in Wisconsin
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:03.840]   in the middle of the day was abducted by aliens
[01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:05.400]   and everyone saw it.
[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:07.960]   You know, you're at the meeting table and whoosh,
[01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:09.000]   what happened?
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.720]   That was Jimmy just got whisked off by alien.
[01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:13.080]   It doesn't happen that way.
[01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:16.000]   It's normally that you're in bed at night.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.280]   It's the early morning hours just before you're waking up.
[01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:20.880]   These aliens came into the room,
[01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:24.000]   they injected something into you, they paralyzed you.
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000]   You couldn't shout, you couldn't move.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:29.120]   It's simply REM sleep paralysis.
[01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:30.800]   Now, when do we see that?
[01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:33.400]   There are ways and not ways
[01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:36.160]   because these are not protocols that we advise.
[01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:38.720]   There are circumstances where the probability
[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:39.760]   of that increases.
[01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:41.480]   And I've experienced this too.
[01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:45.840]   When you are sleep deprived or you are highly stressed,
[01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:48.120]   the likelihood that you will experience
[01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:50.200]   these REM sleep paralysis events
[01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:52.640]   upon awakening is increased.
[01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:57.640]   And for me, it was happening when I was a young PhD student
[01:04:57.640 --> 01:04:59.840]   and I was studying sleep.
[01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:02.480]   And then I would be awake all night
[01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:04.000]   'cause I'd be monitoring the patients
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:05.600]   and looking at their sleep.
[01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:07.080]   - The irony of sleep studies.
[01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:08.920]   - Exactly, that you have to deprive yourself
[01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:11.520]   of the very thing that you are trying to study.
[01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:14.760]   Which by the way, gives you some amazing insights
[01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:16.520]   for experiments that I've had as a consequence,
[01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:18.880]   not that I would advise that as the way.
[01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:21.400]   And we'll come on to why that's not wise
[01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:22.760]   when we speak about creativity.
[01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:27.360]   But we were doing these studies and then I would go home
[01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:29.880]   and then I would take a short period of sleep,
[01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:32.640]   maybe just two and a half hours of sleep.
[01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:36.440]   And then I would wake up, I didn't want to
[01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:38.640]   'cause I was ready to go deep into sleep,
[01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:41.600]   but I would wake up and then I would force myself
[01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:42.600]   to be awake throughout the day
[01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:44.760]   and try to get to bed at a reasonable time.
[01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:46.960]   Because if I slept all day, what's gonna happen?
[01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:48.680]   I'm just gonna be awake all the next night
[01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:50.800]   and I'm gonna be out of my rhythm.
[01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:53.520]   But what's interesting is that when I would wake up then,
[01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:57.000]   I would be waking up maybe at 10 a.m. in the morning, 11.
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:58.880]   And at that point, if you're sleeping there
[01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:00.240]   with someone like my face,
[01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:05.240]   you are in a very REM sleep desiring state
[01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:08.120]   that it's in those last morning hours
[01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:09.640]   and into the early morning hours
[01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:13.160]   when your brain wants to devour off the menu of sleep stages,
[01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:15.680]   this thing called REM in vast quantities.
[01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:18.840]   So I was sleep deprived, point number one.
[01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:21.800]   Second, I was going into a very REM sleep rich phase,
[01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:24.320]   in other words, higher likelihood of paralysis.
[01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:25.360]   And that occurred to me.
[01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:28.080]   Your description is also prototypical.
[01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:30.520]   You've been drinking the night before,
[01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:32.280]   went out to the party.
[01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:35.040]   We spoke about in one of our previous episodes
[01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:36.760]   that one of the problems with alcohol
[01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:39.440]   is that it's very good at blocking your REM sleep.
[01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:42.360]   So you'd been absent of REM sleep the prior night,
[01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:46.160]   you'd built up what we call a REM sleep debt.
[01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:48.440]   And when you slept, all of a sudden,
[01:06:48.440 --> 01:06:50.120]   what your brain wanted more,
[01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:51.920]   because it at least got some sleep
[01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:54.480]   and there you're going to get mostly your deep sleep.
[01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:58.280]   The debt on the sheets of your balance account for sleep
[01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:00.880]   was not so great for deep non-REM,
[01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:03.160]   but you were very much in debt with REM.
[01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:06.360]   So what happened as soon as you conked out on the couch,
[01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:09.120]   whoosh, you were probably straight into REM sleep.
[01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:10.360]   And then when you woke up,
[01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:13.160]   you had this mismatch in timing between consciousness
[01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:14.640]   and the release of paralysis.
[01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:16.000]   What did you experience?
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.560]   REM sleep paralysis.
[01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:18.560]   - Love it.
[01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:19.680]   I mean, hate it.
[01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:22.600]   I did not enjoy it, but I love your description.
[01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:24.520]   It's 'cause it makes so very clear what happened.
[01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:26.120]   And for those that have had the experience,
[01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:29.500]   it can be mildly stressful to terrifying.
[01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:34.240]   So thank you for providing the therapy that is knowledge
[01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:37.280]   and so that people don't stress it too much,
[01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:38.440]   but we still dissuade people
[01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:40.600]   from consuming alcohol prior to sleep.
[01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:41.880]   - Correct.
[01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:42.960]   - I want to take a brief break
[01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:45.360]   and acknowledge our sponsor, InsideTracker.
[01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:47.760]   InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:50.200]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:51.720]   to help you better understand your body
[01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:53.640]   and help you reach your health goals.
[01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:56.400]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:58.480]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:00.400]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:03.000]   can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.440]   The problem with a lot of blood tests out there, however,
[01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:06.840]   is that you get information back
[01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:09.080]   about metabolic factors, hormones, et cetera,
[01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:11.240]   but you don't know what to do with that information.
[01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:13.020]   With InsideTracker, they make it very easy
[01:08:13.020 --> 01:08:14.280]   to understand your results,
[01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:16.400]   and they also point you to specific directives
[01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:18.560]   that you can follow in the realm of nutrition,
[01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:21.260]   exercise, supplementation, even prescription drugs
[01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:23.340]   that can help bring the levels back into the ranges
[01:08:23.340 --> 01:08:24.640]   that are optimal for you.
[01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:27.480]   InsideTracker also offers InsideTracker Pro,
[01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:29.520]   which enables coaches and health professionals
[01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:31.760]   to provide premium and personalized services
[01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:33.680]   by leveraging InsideTracker's analysis
[01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:35.680]   and recommendations with their clients.
[01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:37.220]   If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
[01:08:37.220 --> 01:08:40.640]   you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman

[01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:49.800]   Okay, so we've been discussing complete paralysis,
[01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:53.200]   and of course that's the inability to move.
[01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:56.540]   Let's talk about the ability to move,
[01:08:56.540 --> 01:08:59.360]   meaning motor learning.
[01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:01.920]   What is the relationship between sleep
[01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:03.500]   and learning physical skills,
[01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:05.400]   either coordination of motor movement,
[01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:10.400]   or who knows, maybe increased power output or endurance?
[01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:14.100]   And if you would, could you comment on whether or not
[01:09:14.100 --> 01:09:15.660]   there are specific phases of sleep
[01:09:15.660 --> 01:09:18.680]   that are specifically linked to motor learning?
[01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:19.880]   - Yeah, great question.
[01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:22.300]   So what we've spoken about so far
[01:09:22.300 --> 01:09:24.320]   is that you need sleep after learning
[01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:26.200]   for that textbook-like memory,
[01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:28.320]   and that is one category of memory
[01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:30.320]   that resides within your brain.
[01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:32.680]   There's another type of memory that you've spoken about,
[01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:35.320]   which many of us don't realize is memory,
[01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:37.280]   and that's what we call non-declarative
[01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:39.680]   or procedural skill memory.
[01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:41.920]   So if I were to ask you,
[01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:45.440]   "Okay, Andrew, last night for dinner
[01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:46.960]   or yesterday for lunch,
[01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:51.720]   do you remember what it was that you had to eat?"
[01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:53.760]   My guess is that you could probably tell me.
[01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:57.280]   So do you recall what some of that food was?
[01:09:57.280 --> 01:09:59.000]   - My diet's pretty boring.
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.560]   In a sense, I tend to eat more or less
[01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:01.520]   the same thing every day,
[01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:03.960]   although I'm open to being flexible.
[01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:08.960]   Yesterday for lunch, I had two grass-fed hamburger patties,
[01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:11.960]   maybe a little bit of rice,
[01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:14.120]   a sliced cucumber, some tomatoes,
[01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:17.200]   and because I'm a drive-by blueberry eater,
[01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:19.180]   there were some blueberries out on the counter,
[01:10:19.180 --> 01:10:22.440]   and I had several large fistfuls of those.
[01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:24.640]   And then I washed it down with some water
[01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:28.040]   and a half mug, just like this,
[01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:32.040]   of some cold brew, sugar-free yerba mate.
[01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:34.480]   - And I can confirm, folks, I was there at the incident,
[01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:36.320]   and that's exactly what he had.
[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:39.560]   But did everyone who was watching or listening
[01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:43.440]   just realize what happened in this room today?
[01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:47.400]   Something that Einstein suggested would never be possible,
[01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:50.320]   that Andrew just traveled back in time,
[01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:55.040]   that using this incredible gift of memory,
[01:10:55.040 --> 01:11:00.040]   you folded time, almost like a concertina, compressing it,
[01:11:00.040 --> 01:11:02.300]   and you raced back, within milliseconds,
[01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:05.200]   you were shaking your head, "Yes, I know what I had,"
[01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:07.520]   and you raced back into that catalog
[01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:10.080]   of all of your previous lunches.
[01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:12.400]   You found the correct manila folder
[01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:15.960]   for that specific lunch, all of the details,
[01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:18.040]   and out it popped.
[01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:21.760]   That is a spectacularly complex computational process
[01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:24.360]   that your brain's memory system
[01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:27.240]   accomplished within milliseconds.
[01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:30.940]   It's stunning what we have as this gift of memory.
[01:11:30.940 --> 01:11:33.100]   But as I said, there's another type of memory.
[01:11:33.100 --> 01:11:38.100]   So if I were to ask you, "Okay, how do you ride a bike?"
[01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:39.860]   It's very difficult.
[01:11:39.860 --> 01:11:43.680]   There is no textbook for, "Here is how to ride a bike."
[01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:45.560]   The way that you do it when you're a child
[01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:49.480]   is that you are taught how to learn
[01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:52.000]   how to ride a bike by being on it.
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.820]   So if I were to say, "How," 'cause I'm a long-time cyclist,
[01:11:54.820 --> 01:11:59.340]   "How do I take a right turn with my bicycle?"
[01:11:59.340 --> 01:12:00.540]   The obvious suggestion would be,
[01:12:00.540 --> 01:12:02.400]   "Well, you turn the handlebars."
[01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:04.740]   If you turn the handlebars at 30 miles an hour
[01:12:04.740 --> 01:12:06.940]   trying to go around a right bend,
[01:12:06.940 --> 01:12:09.080]   you're gonna crash very quickly.
[01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:11.680]   What in fact you do is you alter the steering angle
[01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:13.820]   just a little, but you lean.
[01:12:13.820 --> 01:12:17.320]   And that is what we call non-declarative,
[01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:21.080]   meaning you can't declare to me what it is that you know.
[01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:24.120]   You just have to show me through action and behavior.
[01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:25.620]   This is skill learning.
[01:12:25.620 --> 01:12:28.240]   And we use it for things like sports,
[01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:31.280]   surgical procedures, flying planes.
[01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:35.040]   There are so many musical performance as well,
[01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:36.760]   so many aspects.
[01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:38.520]   So we wanted to then say,
[01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:40.560]   "Well, sleep is helpful after learning
[01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:42.220]   "for fact-based memory,
[01:12:42.220 --> 01:12:45.040]   "but what about this other type of memory?"
[01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:48.220]   And in truth, I didn't come up with the idea.
[01:12:48.220 --> 01:12:52.920]   It was given to me back in the, gosh, I'm aging myself.
[01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:55.080]   In the early 2000s, I was back in the UK
[01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:58.160]   and I gave a lecture for the decade of the brain,
[01:12:58.160 --> 01:12:59.720]   which it was back then.
[01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:00.880]   And at the end of the course,
[01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:02.720]   I'd spoken a little bit about sleep
[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:05.240]   and this informational processing,
[01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:07.360]   but no evidence for motor skill memory.
[01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:10.240]   And this gentleman, lovely gentleman,
[01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:12.400]   old gentleman with a sort of a white beard,
[01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:16.360]   I remember his tweed jacket, this green hue, it was beautiful
[01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:18.380]   and he came up to me at the end and he said,
[01:13:18.380 --> 01:13:21.000]   "Look, I'm a musician, I'm a pianist.
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:24.340]   "And I was fascinated by what you said about sleep.
[01:13:24.340 --> 01:13:27.720]   "Sometimes I'll sit down and I'm learning a new piece
[01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:30.240]   "and I just don't seem to be able to get it.
[01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:33.040]   "And I practice, practice and practice into the evening
[01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:35.120]   "and then I just stop."
[01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:36.720]   And then I come back the next day
[01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:40.840]   and I sit down at the piano and I can just play.
[01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:43.400]   Do you think that's sleep?
[01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:46.040]   And of course, at that moment,
[01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:49.760]   my mind starts just rolodexing with ideas
[01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:50.760]   and I'm thinking, gosh,
[01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:53.680]   there's the next 10 years of my work and grants.
[01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:55.280]   And so I sort of said,
[01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:58.080]   look, I think it's a fascinating hypothesis.
[01:13:58.080 --> 01:14:01.320]   It could also be that you're just maybe a little bit tired
[01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:04.480]   in the evening, but it's entirely possible.
[01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:07.520]   I don't know of any evidence yet that supports that.
[01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:09.640]   - I suppose the alternative hypothesis
[01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:12.200]   that there's simply a certain amount of time
[01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:15.040]   that needs to elapse after experiencing something new
[01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:16.440]   that one wants to learn.
[01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:18.080]   The trigger for learning is, I don't know,
[01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:22.680]   some biochemical slash neural signal.
[01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:23.720]   That's like a wave front
[01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:26.080]   and it takes a while for that wave to go ashore,
[01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:27.680]   which is learning.
[01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:29.960]   And that independent of how much sleep one gets
[01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:32.640]   or the quality of sleep, the learning could occur.
[01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:34.440]   I suppose that's one idea.
[01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:37.240]   - No, that's in fact precisely the central hypothesis
[01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:39.240]   that we then set out to test,
[01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:43.440]   which is that maybe it's practice,
[01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:47.120]   then some time that helps you create
[01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:49.280]   that perfect motor routine.
[01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:52.480]   That's one hypothesis, but let's split that apart.
[01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:55.480]   Maybe it's time, but time spent awake,
[01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:58.480]   or is it time, but time spent asleep?
[01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:02.400]   So we designed a study to disambiguate between those two.
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:05.600]   Both groups learned a motor skill task,
[01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:07.520]   and it's very much like learning a piano.
[01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:09.280]   And you learn a sequence of movements.
[01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:11.400]   Let's just say four, one, three, two, four.
[01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:14.040]   And we have you type that out over and over again
[01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:15.480]   for periods of 30 seconds,
[01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:16.720]   and then you rest for 30 seconds,
[01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:17.880]   and then you do it again.
[01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:19.680]   You do 12 of those trials.
[01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:24.240]   And sure enough, practice seemed to get you better.
[01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:27.240]   And you were learning and your learning curve went up.
[01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:30.800]   And then we brought those participants back 12 hours later
[01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:34.520]   and we retested them on that same motor memory.
[01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:37.040]   Half of those participants spent that 12 hours awake.
[01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:39.720]   The others had a night of sleep
[01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:41.960]   in between an eight-hour night of sleep.
[01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:45.080]   When we brought the people who had learned in the morning
[01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:47.320]   and tested in the evening without sleep,
[01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:50.120]   they had retained that memory.
[01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:53.120]   They were no worse, they were just no better.
[01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:55.960]   But in the people who had slept,
[01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:59.000]   what was stunning was that they had improved
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:02.720]   their performance output speed by 20%
[01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:07.720]   and they'd improved their accuracy by almost 37%.
[01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:10.760]   So in other words,
[01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:15.760]   it wasn't time that you needed to produce perfection.
[01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:18.640]   It was time with sleep.
[01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:21.160]   In other words, you've often heard the statement,
[01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:25.160]   practice makes perfect, but we violated that edict.
[01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:27.600]   It wasn't practice that makes perfect.
[01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:29.920]   It's practice with a night of sleep
[01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:33.360]   that makes or leads to perfection.
[01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:35.320]   In other words, after learning,
[01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:37.880]   your brain continues to improve
[01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:40.480]   in the absence of any further practice.
[01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:43.800]   However, that learning occurs exclusively
[01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:46.160]   during periods of offline sleep
[01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:50.880]   and not across equivalent time periods while you're awake.
[01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:52.560]   Now, what was interesting in the group
[01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:55.600]   that remained awake across those 12 hours,
[01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:57.240]   we then actually brought them back
[01:16:57.240 --> 01:17:00.840]   after a further 12 hours, but now after a night of sleep
[01:17:00.840 --> 01:17:04.000]   and they showed that beautiful benefit.
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:09.000]   - So the sleep that can, let's say, enhance,
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.800]   although I think what we're really talking about here
[01:17:11.800 --> 01:17:16.800]   that consolidates motor learning can arrive the night after,
[01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:20.920]   meaning one finishes, let's say, learning at 11 a.m.
[01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:24.240]   and then they sleep later that night or the following night.
[01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:27.320]   And in both instances, that sleep can enhance
[01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:30.680]   or let's say consolidate the motor learning that occurred.
[01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:31.520]   - That's right.
[01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:33.680]   So it was to your question actually that we discussed earlier
[01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:35.320]   and I recall now I didn't answer it,
[01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:39.240]   which is that the things that you learn throughout the day,
[01:17:39.240 --> 01:17:41.520]   you don't have to worry about learning them
[01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:44.880]   really close to bedtime so that they're available
[01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:47.360]   and accessible for this sleep dependent work
[01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:49.560]   of sleep after learning.
[01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:51.880]   It seems to be that the human brain,
[01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:55.400]   and we've plotted this, we've looked at how,
[01:17:55.400 --> 01:17:58.280]   at what point does the brain sort of fail
[01:17:58.280 --> 01:18:02.600]   in terms of its ability to place on hold
[01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:04.960]   sort of on the runway ready to take off
[01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:07.320]   into the consolidation phase.
[01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:10.320]   And it seems to be about 16 hours
[01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:14.200]   that you can hold on to those freshly formed memories
[01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:17.880]   for about 16 hours, and then you get the chance
[01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:19.080]   to sleep and consolidate them.
[01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:21.480]   So if you learn at 11 o'clock in the morning,
[01:18:21.480 --> 01:18:23.960]   or if you learn at 7 p.m. in the evening,
[01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:25.360]   don't worry about that.
[01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:28.360]   Those memories are still going to be gathered together
[01:18:28.360 --> 01:18:30.920]   in the beautiful receptive arms of sleep
[01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:32.840]   and then knitted up and enhanced
[01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:35.080]   when it comes to procedural memories.
[01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:36.760]   And by the way, that's a key difference
[01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:38.920]   to those two types of memory.
[01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:41.760]   Sleep will take fact-based memories
[01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:45.160]   and simply save them so that you don't forget.
[01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:47.880]   It doesn't necessarily boost them anymore.
[01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:50.080]   It just simply prevents you from forgetting,
[01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:53.920]   which is what would happen otherwise across a waking day.
[01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:54.960]   - Key point.
[01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:59.200]   It's not enhancement, it's consolidation of,
[01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:04.200]   or essentially the way I might think about it
[01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:09.360]   is the new information is put into a potential memory bank.
[01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:12.440]   And that information is either flushed or maintained
[01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:14.200]   depending on whether or not you get sleep.
[01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:15.040]   - That's right.
[01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:15.920]   - There's no enhancement.
[01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:19.480]   Enhancement would be super normal levels of memory
[01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:20.360]   if you sleep.
[01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:22.520]   - And that's the case for textbook-like memory.
[01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:24.440]   In other words, sleep comes in
[01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:27.120]   and it stems the blood flow of forgetting
[01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:29.560]   from the memory wound, as it were, to get,
[01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:30.680]   I don't know why I came up with that.
[01:19:30.680 --> 01:19:31.520]   That's a terrible analogy.
[01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:32.360]   - No, I like it.
[01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:33.680]   I guess we might say hemorrhage, right?
[01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:34.560]   Like it's- - Yes.
[01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:35.520]   - Okay.
[01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:39.240]   - But so sleep comes in and prevents that from happening.
[01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:42.600]   But with motor memories, it is enhancement.
[01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:45.120]   It's that when you're awake across the day,
[01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:46.680]   you don't get any worse,
[01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:49.800]   which is what happens with fact textbook memory.
[01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:52.280]   You hold that performance,
[01:19:52.280 --> 01:19:55.240]   but then sleep comes in and it boosts you even further.
[01:19:55.240 --> 01:19:58.880]   You get a nice benefit without doing anything further.
[01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:03.360]   So then the question became to your point,
[01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:04.720]   if sleep is doing that,
[01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:06.520]   if it's not practice that makes perfect,
[01:20:06.520 --> 01:20:09.960]   but practice with sleep, what is it about sleep?
[01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:12.280]   So we looked at the sleep physiology
[01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:15.080]   and what we found were two interesting components.
[01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:18.000]   First, it seemed to be related to that lighter form
[01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.720]   of stage two non-REM sleep.
[01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:22.600]   I told you that textbook memory
[01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:25.720]   requires deep non-REM sleep stages three and four,
[01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:27.880]   casting back to episode one.
[01:20:27.880 --> 01:20:30.360]   Motor memory, more dependent on stage two
[01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:32.720]   and those beautiful spindles
[01:20:32.720 --> 01:20:36.480]   that are the hallmark of beginning your stage two.
[01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:37.840]   The more of those that you had,
[01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:41.400]   the greater the memory benefit the next day.
[01:20:41.400 --> 01:20:42.360]   We then wanted to say,
[01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:45.680]   well, is this effect simply something to do
[01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:47.640]   with the nighttime?
[01:20:47.640 --> 01:20:49.440]   Because that's the other hypothesis.
[01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:51.240]   It's not really about sleep.
[01:20:51.240 --> 01:20:53.240]   It's just something about nighttime-ness
[01:20:53.240 --> 01:20:56.080]   because in all of the studies I've described so far,
[01:20:56.080 --> 01:20:57.560]   they're all happening at night
[01:20:57.560 --> 01:20:59.280]   and at night they were sleeping.
[01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:03.080]   So is it really nighttime or is it specifically sleep?
[01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:05.480]   So now we did a nap study with motor skill learning.
[01:21:05.480 --> 01:21:07.560]   We repeated that and sure enough,
[01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:09.880]   even though that time period was across the day,
[01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:12.520]   not during night-ness,
[01:21:12.520 --> 01:21:15.760]   they showed this beautiful motor skill benefit
[01:21:15.760 --> 01:21:18.240]   if they napped versus if they did not.
[01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:20.080]   And then in that nap study,
[01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:22.000]   I was telling you that they were learning the sequence
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.720]   with the right non-dominant hand
[01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:28.280]   and we selected all right handers to make it equal.
[01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:29.840]   And they were typing four, one, three, two, four,
[01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:31.880]   four, one, three, two, four.
[01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:34.360]   And that right hand, as well you know,
[01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:37.320]   is controlled by the left motor cortex.
[01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:40.200]   So after in the nap study, when we recorded their sleep,
[01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:42.560]   we used very high density EEG.
[01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:45.160]   So lots and lots of sensors on top of the head.
[01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:48.240]   So we could map with high fidelity resolution,
[01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:51.280]   the surface of the brain or the surface of the scalp
[01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:53.800]   and infer what's going on in the brain.
[01:21:53.800 --> 01:21:56.320]   And what was interesting is that yes, those sleep spindles,
[01:21:56.320 --> 01:21:57.880]   the more of them that you had in the nap,
[01:21:57.880 --> 01:22:00.200]   the better your motor skill learning was,
[01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:04.200]   but there seemed to be a lateralized effect
[01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:06.880]   such that the sleep spindle activity
[01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:09.040]   on the right side of the brain,
[01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:11.840]   which controls the left hand, which was not working,
[01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:14.720]   that showed no spindle increased in activity.
[01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:18.800]   However, on the right hand activity
[01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:22.360]   that invoked activation in the left motor cortex,
[01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:26.120]   that left motor cortex and specifically the hand region
[01:22:26.120 --> 01:22:30.040]   showed a local increase in spindle activity.
[01:22:30.040 --> 01:22:33.240]   And subsequent work and work prior to ours
[01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:38.240]   had demonstrated that it's not sleep physiology globally.
[01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:41.360]   It's almost as though your sleep physiology
[01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:46.040]   responds to the mapping of the memory in the brain.
[01:22:46.040 --> 01:22:49.400]   Wherever the memory is, that's where sleep,
[01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:54.120]   when you go to sleep, sort of starts massaging the cortex
[01:22:54.120 --> 01:22:55.640]   so that you get that plasticity.
[01:22:55.640 --> 01:22:57.520]   It's almost like a good masseuse.
[01:22:57.520 --> 01:22:59.280]   You know, you sort of sit down and they say,
[01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:00.480]   where are your problem points?
[01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:03.120]   And you say, it's here and here.
[01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:04.880]   And so they don't give you a general massage.
[01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:06.680]   They go to work on the regions
[01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:08.480]   that have been working hardest,
[01:23:08.480 --> 01:23:10.360]   that require greatest attention.
[01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:12.840]   Sleep does that.
[01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:14.600]   - That's amazing.
[01:23:14.600 --> 01:23:17.320]   And reminds me of some of this work that was done,
[01:23:17.320 --> 01:23:19.680]   I think in the late '90s, early 2000s,
[01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:22.560]   Richard Morris and colleagues over in,
[01:23:22.560 --> 01:23:24.360]   I think he was in Edinburgh,
[01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:28.720]   talked about synaptic tagging.
[01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:32.600]   You know, this notion that animals or humans perform
[01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:35.000]   or learn some new motor skill,
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.120]   maybe navigation of a novel environment,
[01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:41.200]   maybe a motor skill of the 41234 that you described,
[01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:43.920]   you know, keys on a piano or something like that.
[01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:47.200]   And then it was acknowledged that the changes
[01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:50.000]   in the connections between neurons don't occur immediately,
[01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.160]   which meant that there had to be some sort of tag
[01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:55.040]   or label to the synapses that marked them
[01:23:55.040 --> 01:23:57.800]   for consolidation later for plasticity,
[01:23:57.800 --> 01:24:00.080]   long-term potentiation, things of that sort.
[01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:02.080]   The names don't really matter.
[01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:06.560]   I think later it became clear based on Marcus Frank's work
[01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:09.440]   and others that indeed during sleep,
[01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:13.320]   the hard rewiring of the nervous system occurs,
[01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:15.040]   plasticity occurs.
[01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:18.040]   But what you're saying is that there's a high degree
[01:24:18.040 --> 01:24:21.960]   of specificity, meaning the specific circuits
[01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:24.760]   that were active and required for the learning
[01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:26.520]   are the specific circuits that are modified,
[01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:28.680]   which on the face of it, one could say, well, of course.
[01:24:28.680 --> 01:24:31.440]   But what that means is that during sleep,
[01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:34.880]   the brain is somehow able to,
[01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:37.280]   the neurons of the brain that is,
[01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:42.280]   are able to chemically or electrically or both signal,
[01:24:42.280 --> 01:24:46.400]   like this is where there needs to be
[01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:48.000]   some modifications done.
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:49.540]   And then like a night crew,
[01:24:49.540 --> 01:24:54.160]   the brain self-induces its own changes,
[01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:55.320]   which is remarkable.
[01:24:55.320 --> 01:24:56.160]   - It really is.
[01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:58.040]   It's almost as though there are red flags
[01:24:58.040 --> 01:25:00.560]   that are planted in the territories
[01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:04.480]   that have undergone learning dependent plasticity.
[01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:09.160]   And they are calling out almost like hungry mouths
[01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:13.880]   that are in plasticity famine for the feast relief
[01:25:13.880 --> 01:25:16.600]   that comes by way of sleep.
[01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:19.240]   - Do we know what the factors are that are released in sleep
[01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:20.400]   that allow that to occur?
[01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:22.600]   Or is it, I'm guessing there are many.
[01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:25.600]   People love to talk about brain derived nootrophic factor,
[01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:28.280]   BDNF, which is a very interesting molecule,
[01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:32.360]   but it's probably just one of a panoply of molecules
[01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:34.280]   that are important.
[01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:37.400]   - We don't know necessarily the neurochemical processes,
[01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:40.000]   although some people have manipulated plasticity
[01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:43.400]   and then blocked it with different types of NMDA,
[01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:46.080]   which is a certain type of receptor in the brain
[01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:48.160]   for excitatory activity,
[01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:52.160]   which is the underlying basis of brain plasticity.
[01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:54.080]   So that certainly is dependent.
[01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:56.440]   But what's interesting about the sleep spindles,
[01:25:56.440 --> 01:25:58.800]   I said in the first episode that they burst
[01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:01.560]   somewhere between about 12 to 15 times per second.
[01:26:01.560 --> 01:26:06.560]   If you apply that type of stimulation
[01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:10.400]   to a particular neuronal circuit within the brain,
[01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:13.800]   that seems to be one of the, and it's not the only,
[01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:18.800]   but one of the ideal sort of sweet spot tickling of neurons
[01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:21.320]   that forces them to say,
[01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:24.000]   oh, I think I should strengthen this circuit.
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.040]   So it's almost as though these sleep spindles
[01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:30.240]   are ideally designed at the frequency,
[01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:33.560]   at the sort of tickling level of neurons
[01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:36.560]   to stimulate exactly what we think is the underlying basis
[01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:38.320]   of strengthening a memory,
[01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:41.400]   which is at the level of the neurons,
[01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:44.680]   the strengthening of synapses.
[01:26:44.680 --> 01:26:47.560]   - So interesting because we hear this fire together,
[01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:50.360]   wire together, high-frequency transmission between neurons
[01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:52.200]   is what creates plasticity,
[01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:55.720]   but this is literally a replay of previously,
[01:26:55.720 --> 01:26:57.600]   meaning earlier that day or the previous day,
[01:26:57.600 --> 01:27:00.320]   as you pointed out, activity in the given circuit
[01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:03.280]   being replayed, not unlike the work
[01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:04.360]   that you talked about earlier,
[01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:07.400]   the fast replay of neurons in the hippocampus,
[01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:09.800]   but here it's not necessarily just in the hippocampus,
[01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:12.080]   it can be in the neocortex or other structures
[01:27:12.080 --> 01:27:16.800]   that then builds up the vigor
[01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:19.020]   with which that circuit can function in the daytime,
[01:27:19.020 --> 01:27:22.940]   AKA learning, it's super interesting.
[01:27:22.940 --> 01:27:26.260]   You mentioned that this is occurring largely in stage two
[01:27:26.260 --> 01:27:28.680]   of sleep, not in rapid eye movement sleep.
[01:27:28.680 --> 01:27:31.820]   Is this business of stage two being the main period of sleep
[01:27:31.820 --> 01:27:34.820]   in which motor learning occurs unique to motor learning?
[01:27:34.820 --> 01:27:36.700]   In other words, cognitive information
[01:27:36.700 --> 01:27:40.820]   surely can get wired into the brain at night,
[01:27:40.820 --> 01:27:42.820]   but is that largely associated
[01:27:42.820 --> 01:27:44.620]   just with rapid eye movement sleep?
[01:27:44.620 --> 01:27:46.700]   What this would suggest, in other words,
[01:27:46.700 --> 01:27:51.080]   is that the earlier stages of sleep, one and two,
[01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:52.900]   and heading into three and four,
[01:27:52.900 --> 01:27:54.340]   serves a specific purpose,
[01:27:54.340 --> 01:27:57.860]   which is consolidation of motor skills
[01:27:57.860 --> 01:28:01.200]   and motor learning from the previous one or two days.
[01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:02.760]   - It does seem to be that stage two.
[01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:07.760]   Stage one is, we now think of more of a transitional stage,
[01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:09.740]   but we will speak perhaps
[01:28:09.740 --> 01:28:12.380]   when we discuss the idea of creativity,
[01:28:12.380 --> 01:28:14.620]   that it also may have a memory function,
[01:28:14.620 --> 01:28:17.500]   that very light first step of sleep.
[01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:21.100]   Stage two is certainly related to motor skill.
[01:28:21.100 --> 01:28:23.180]   In fact, stage two is fascinating.
[01:28:23.180 --> 01:28:25.460]   We used to think of it as just the stage
[01:28:25.460 --> 01:28:28.020]   that you had to go into to get to deep sleep,
[01:28:28.020 --> 01:28:30.380]   and the stage that you had to go back through
[01:28:30.380 --> 01:28:32.920]   to get up to REM sleep.
[01:28:32.920 --> 01:28:35.220]   Never made any sense to me, why?
[01:28:35.220 --> 01:28:37.380]   Because stage two non-REM sleep
[01:28:37.380 --> 01:28:41.020]   is about 40 to 50% of your night.
[01:28:41.020 --> 01:28:45.220]   Why would you spend 40 to 50% of your time asleep
[01:28:45.220 --> 01:28:48.820]   when it's just simply a gate to get to something better?
[01:28:48.820 --> 01:28:49.980]   You would spend more time
[01:28:49.980 --> 01:28:53.340]   in the something that's better stages.
[01:28:53.340 --> 01:28:56.300]   So we started to find functions,
[01:28:56.300 --> 01:28:59.140]   and stage two is distributed throughout the night,
[01:28:59.140 --> 01:29:02.860]   but those sleep spindles in stage two
[01:29:02.860 --> 01:29:06.380]   are not evenly distributed throughout the night.
[01:29:06.380 --> 01:29:08.380]   You get some of them in the first quarter,
[01:29:08.380 --> 01:29:10.780]   more of them in the second quarter of sleep.
[01:29:10.780 --> 01:29:12.580]   Certainly more in the third quarter,
[01:29:12.580 --> 01:29:15.340]   but you get a lot more of those sleep spindles
[01:29:15.340 --> 01:29:17.060]   in the last quarter of the night.
[01:29:17.060 --> 01:29:19.420]   And in fact, when we looked at the overnight study,
[01:29:19.420 --> 01:29:21.580]   where we had people learn in the evening,
[01:29:21.580 --> 01:29:22.660]   tested the next day,
[01:29:22.660 --> 01:29:25.020]   we recorded their sleep in between.
[01:29:25.020 --> 01:29:27.460]   Yes, sleep spindles predicted,
[01:29:27.460 --> 01:29:29.300]   and stage two predicted how much better
[01:29:29.300 --> 01:29:30.420]   they were the next day,
[01:29:30.420 --> 01:29:32.780]   but it was especially stage two
[01:29:32.780 --> 01:29:35.060]   in the last quarter of the night.
[01:29:35.060 --> 01:29:36.420]   Let's say I'm going to bed,
[01:29:36.420 --> 01:29:38.820]   I'm just, for argument's sake, for ease,
[01:29:38.820 --> 01:29:40.740]   midnight and I'm waking up at eight.
[01:29:40.740 --> 01:29:44.500]   It's in that sort of 6 a.m. to 8 a.m. range
[01:29:44.500 --> 01:29:46.940]   when I, if I was going to sleep at that time,
[01:29:46.940 --> 01:29:48.540]   would be getting my stage two.
[01:29:48.540 --> 01:29:50.100]   And I find that interesting
[01:29:50.100 --> 01:29:53.380]   because it is the time of night
[01:29:53.380 --> 01:29:55.700]   that we all feel it's okay to cut short,
[01:29:55.700 --> 01:29:57.940]   to get a jumpstart on the day.
[01:29:57.940 --> 01:30:01.580]   It's this modern life erosion of our sleep time.
[01:30:01.580 --> 01:30:03.780]   And what these findings would suggest
[01:30:03.780 --> 01:30:06.100]   is that you are shortchanging your brain
[01:30:06.100 --> 01:30:09.140]   of some significant motor memory performance,
[01:30:09.140 --> 01:30:11.700]   especially those classic Olympic coaches
[01:30:11.700 --> 01:30:13.780]   that have the athletes training
[01:30:13.780 --> 01:30:16.180]   until eight in the evening.
[01:30:16.180 --> 01:30:19.980]   And then they're in bed by sort of 10 or 11,
[01:30:19.980 --> 01:30:22.460]   but they have them waking up at five
[01:30:22.460 --> 01:30:25.660]   back on the athletic field at six,
[01:30:25.660 --> 01:30:28.780]   but they would gain some additional motor memory benefit
[01:30:28.780 --> 01:30:31.540]   if you just let them sleep a little bit longer.
[01:30:31.540 --> 01:30:33.220]   - I recall there was a study done at Stanford,
[01:30:33.220 --> 01:30:35.180]   relatively small study,
[01:30:35.180 --> 01:30:36.380]   but interesting nonetheless,
[01:30:36.380 --> 01:30:38.540]   because I think it was the basketball team
[01:30:38.540 --> 01:30:42.500]   that was asked to spend,
[01:30:42.500 --> 01:30:45.100]   I think an additional two hours in bed.
[01:30:45.100 --> 01:30:46.820]   - It's a sleep extension study.
[01:30:46.820 --> 01:30:48.020]   - And they were even told
[01:30:48.020 --> 01:30:52.260]   that they could do other things in bed besides sleep.
[01:30:52.260 --> 01:30:54.780]   There might've been some specifications of, you know,
[01:30:54.780 --> 01:30:57.660]   things they should not do in bed during that time,
[01:30:57.660 --> 01:30:58.980]   but at least by self-report,
[01:30:58.980 --> 01:31:01.860]   some of the students said that they slept a bit more
[01:31:01.860 --> 01:31:03.460]   or they relaxed a bit more in bed.
[01:31:03.460 --> 01:31:05.820]   And indeed, when compared to the control group,
[01:31:05.820 --> 01:31:08.820]   there was a significant improvement in their,
[01:31:08.820 --> 01:31:13.380]   I forget if it was free throw percentage, excuse me,
[01:31:13.380 --> 01:31:15.580]   or other metrics of basketball performance.
[01:31:15.580 --> 01:31:17.540]   - Yeah, it was their point scoring performance.
[01:31:17.540 --> 01:31:19.620]   It was their speed up and down the court.
[01:31:19.620 --> 01:31:21.660]   And it was a great study done by Sherry Marr
[01:31:21.660 --> 01:31:23.700]   at Stanford University.
[01:31:23.700 --> 01:31:25.940]   And she's done epic work with athletes
[01:31:25.940 --> 01:31:28.580]   to sort of replicate those findings.
[01:31:28.580 --> 01:31:30.780]   And the athlete story is interesting.
[01:31:30.780 --> 01:31:31.780]   Some people may be saying,
[01:31:31.780 --> 01:31:33.940]   well, didn't you just make a hop, skip and a jump
[01:31:33.940 --> 01:31:36.060]   from, you know, four, one, three, two, four
[01:31:36.060 --> 01:31:38.740]   to inferring complex motor skill?
[01:31:38.740 --> 01:31:39.580]   I thought about that.
[01:31:39.580 --> 01:31:43.180]   So we did a new series of studies where we,
[01:31:43.180 --> 01:31:44.020]   this is control.
[01:31:44.020 --> 01:31:46.740]   That's the nice thing about the sort of typing on a sequence.
[01:31:46.740 --> 01:31:48.780]   You can really measure that performance
[01:31:48.780 --> 01:31:50.900]   with high sort of accuracy.
[01:31:50.900 --> 01:31:53.180]   But we then switched it to a bimanual task,
[01:31:53.180 --> 01:31:55.380]   much more like learning to play a piano.
[01:31:55.380 --> 01:31:56.740]   And you were learning sequences
[01:31:56.740 --> 01:31:59.660]   that were 12, 14 items in length.
[01:31:59.660 --> 01:32:01.900]   You had to learn them over and over.
[01:32:01.900 --> 01:32:03.660]   And we had a hypothesis,
[01:32:03.660 --> 01:32:07.260]   would sleep fail at the task
[01:32:07.260 --> 01:32:10.540]   when motor skill performance became much more complex
[01:32:10.540 --> 01:32:11.780]   or would it be different?
[01:32:11.780 --> 01:32:13.980]   And what we found was that the more and more complex
[01:32:13.980 --> 01:32:15.380]   the motor skill became,
[01:32:15.380 --> 01:32:18.860]   the greater and greater the benefit of sleep
[01:32:18.860 --> 01:32:21.340]   by way of that consolidation effect.
[01:32:21.340 --> 01:32:23.460]   And then I started to hear something
[01:32:23.460 --> 01:32:25.140]   'cause I would often be in the room
[01:32:25.140 --> 01:32:27.820]   as these participants were learning the sequence.
[01:32:27.820 --> 01:32:30.180]   And then as they were testing
[01:32:30.180 --> 01:32:33.060]   and my ears started to hear something
[01:32:33.060 --> 01:32:36.620]   that I couldn't quite believe to begin with.
[01:32:36.620 --> 01:32:39.860]   They would start to learn these motor sequences,
[01:32:39.860 --> 01:32:42.540]   but they would seem to have these pauses.
[01:32:42.540 --> 01:32:45.460]   And it's what we call chunking in motor skill memory.
[01:32:45.460 --> 01:32:47.500]   So instead of four, one, three, two, four,
[01:32:47.500 --> 01:32:48.540]   four, one, three, two, four,
[01:32:48.540 --> 01:32:50.860]   they would do four, one, three, two, four,
[01:32:50.860 --> 01:32:52.580]   four, one, three, two, four.
[01:32:52.580 --> 01:32:54.420]   And I would have them be using the same keyboard.
[01:32:54.420 --> 01:32:56.700]   And I got to know the sound of the keyboard.
[01:32:56.700 --> 01:32:58.660]   So I could hear it four, one, three, two, four,
[01:32:58.660 --> 01:33:00.060]   four, one, three, two, four.
[01:33:00.060 --> 01:33:02.660]   And then when they came back the next day,
[01:33:02.660 --> 01:33:04.100]   yes, they were performing faster,
[01:33:04.100 --> 01:33:06.140]   but they weren't just doing four, one, three, two, four,
[01:33:06.140 --> 01:33:07.900]   four, one, three, two, four.
[01:33:07.900 --> 01:33:09.660]   They were simply doing four, one, three, two, four,
[01:33:09.660 --> 01:33:11.020]   four, one, three, two, four, four.
[01:33:11.020 --> 01:33:13.380]   There was no gap at all.
[01:33:13.380 --> 01:33:16.140]   So we went into the individual responses,
[01:33:16.140 --> 01:33:19.140]   individual motor sort of finger responses.
[01:33:19.140 --> 01:33:21.420]   And sure enough, before sleep,
[01:33:21.420 --> 01:33:23.620]   there were these very clear problem points,
[01:33:23.620 --> 01:33:27.380]   almost these pain points in the motor memory sequence.
[01:33:27.380 --> 01:33:29.780]   But then when we came back after a night of sleep
[01:33:29.780 --> 01:33:31.100]   and looked at their data,
[01:33:31.100 --> 01:33:33.900]   it wasn't as though sleep simply grabbed
[01:33:33.900 --> 01:33:36.540]   the motor skill memory sort of profile
[01:33:36.540 --> 01:33:38.620]   and lifted everything up.
[01:33:38.620 --> 01:33:42.140]   Sleep was selectively going after those pain points
[01:33:42.140 --> 01:33:43.900]   and improving them.
[01:33:43.900 --> 01:33:45.700]   And that to me was interesting
[01:33:45.700 --> 01:33:48.900]   because that's the goal of a good athlete.
[01:33:48.900 --> 01:33:51.060]   It is automaticity.
[01:33:51.060 --> 01:33:52.900]   You don't want to be thinking about it.
[01:33:52.900 --> 01:33:55.940]   At some point, you go from a very conscious act
[01:33:55.940 --> 01:33:57.860]   of deliberately trying to remember
[01:33:57.860 --> 01:33:59.100]   what you should be doing
[01:33:59.100 --> 01:34:01.940]   to then not thinking about it at all.
[01:34:01.940 --> 01:34:05.420]   It's only automaticity that gives you that ability
[01:34:05.420 --> 01:34:06.620]   not to think,
[01:34:06.620 --> 01:34:10.540]   and it operates below the level of consciousness.
[01:34:10.540 --> 01:34:11.660]   - Super interesting.
[01:34:11.660 --> 01:34:15.260]   And here we're talking about specific changes in the brain
[01:34:15.260 --> 01:34:17.900]   in terms of neural activity, et cetera,
[01:34:17.900 --> 01:34:21.380]   that occur during sleep when we've been exposed to
[01:34:21.380 --> 01:34:26.380]   or engaged in a particular novel for us motor skill.
[01:34:26.380 --> 01:34:30.700]   And you see these spindles in stage two, et cetera.
[01:34:30.700 --> 01:34:32.340]   But does it work the other way as well?
[01:34:32.340 --> 01:34:35.740]   Meaning does the process of trying to learn
[01:34:35.740 --> 01:34:39.700]   a new motor skill enhance certain components of sleep
[01:34:39.700 --> 01:34:42.540]   or maybe even one's ability to sleep?
[01:34:42.540 --> 01:34:47.540]   Years ago, I heard that practicing unilateral leg movements
[01:34:47.700 --> 01:34:52.020]   practicing unilateral leg movements,
[01:34:52.020 --> 01:34:53.580]   this is perhaps a crazy idea,
[01:34:53.580 --> 01:34:55.460]   but it makes sense in the context
[01:34:55.460 --> 01:34:56.300]   of what we're talking about.
[01:34:56.300 --> 01:34:57.820]   Practicing unilateral leg movements,
[01:34:57.820 --> 01:35:00.140]   things like, you know, everyone's familiar with squats
[01:35:00.140 --> 01:35:01.580]   and deadlifts and things of that sort,
[01:35:01.580 --> 01:35:03.180]   but there are some one-legged movements.
[01:35:03.180 --> 01:35:04.140]   - Like a pistol squat.
[01:35:04.140 --> 01:35:06.900]   - I think a pistol squat does pretty hard.
[01:35:06.900 --> 01:35:09.340]   If one can do them, I'm always impressed.
[01:35:09.340 --> 01:35:10.860]   Bulgarian split squats, you know,
[01:35:10.860 --> 01:35:12.500]   foot up on the bench and then squatting down
[01:35:12.500 --> 01:35:14.140]   with a dumbbell, things like that.
[01:35:14.140 --> 01:35:17.540]   Or just unilateral movements that require a lot
[01:35:17.540 --> 01:35:21.220]   of mental attention to the performance of that movement.
[01:35:21.220 --> 01:35:23.480]   Could be in the gym, but it could be something else as well.
[01:35:23.480 --> 01:35:25.420]   Could make you think about a dancer trying to learn
[01:35:25.420 --> 01:35:28.860]   how to organize their steps,
[01:35:28.860 --> 01:35:30.260]   where they have to pay careful attention
[01:35:30.260 --> 01:35:31.580]   to right versus left foot, right?
[01:35:31.580 --> 01:35:33.700]   They always say, you know, like people have two right feet,
[01:35:33.700 --> 01:35:35.020]   they can't, you can't dance up,
[01:35:35.020 --> 01:35:35.860]   two right feet or two left feet.
[01:35:35.860 --> 01:35:36.820]   - By the way, for those listening,
[01:35:36.820 --> 01:35:37.980]   Andrew's looking at me right now
[01:35:37.980 --> 01:35:40.700]   when he's saying two right feet, rightfully so.
[01:35:40.700 --> 01:35:43.940]   - No, I have no knowledge of your dancing ability
[01:35:43.940 --> 01:35:45.980]   or challenges. - Absence thereof.
[01:35:45.980 --> 01:35:52.140]   - As I recall, there may have been some very preliminary data
[01:35:52.140 --> 01:35:55.940]   about changes in the amount of certain sleep stages,
[01:35:55.940 --> 01:35:58.180]   according to whether or not someone had tried
[01:35:58.180 --> 01:35:59.820]   to learn a skill, in this case,
[01:35:59.820 --> 01:36:04.820]   unilateral limb performance the previous day.
[01:36:04.820 --> 01:36:08.380]   So in other words, if one wants to improve their sleep,
[01:36:08.380 --> 01:36:11.660]   would the attempt to learn a new motor skill
[01:36:11.660 --> 01:36:14.820]   be one avenue to improve one's sleep?
[01:36:14.820 --> 01:36:15.980]   - It's interesting.
[01:36:15.980 --> 01:36:17.340]   If you look at some of the data,
[01:36:17.340 --> 01:36:20.620]   it's a little bit mixed in terms of motor skill learning,
[01:36:20.620 --> 01:36:23.340]   but there are some studies demonstrating
[01:36:23.340 --> 01:36:26.100]   that it's true for textbook-like memory.
[01:36:26.100 --> 01:36:28.220]   And there's a study, gosh, done many years ago,
[01:36:28.220 --> 01:36:31.700]   again, by the great German group of Jan Born,
[01:36:31.700 --> 01:36:34.340]   and they simply asked the question,
[01:36:34.340 --> 01:36:39.260]   if you were to just not be learning very deliberately
[01:36:39.260 --> 01:36:43.940]   and intensively through a textbook-like set of information,
[01:36:43.940 --> 01:36:46.580]   and then we just measure your sleep to get a baseline,
[01:36:46.580 --> 01:36:50.020]   and then we force you to have a very long,
[01:36:50.020 --> 01:36:53.660]   very intensive learning session of these facts,
[01:36:53.660 --> 01:36:55.620]   and then we measure your sleep again,
[01:36:55.620 --> 01:36:57.780]   is there any difference relative
[01:36:57.780 --> 01:37:00.140]   to the non-intensive learning day
[01:37:00.140 --> 01:37:02.060]   versus the intensive learning day?
[01:37:02.060 --> 01:37:04.940]   And indeed, what they found was that there was an increase
[01:37:04.940 --> 01:37:08.940]   in their deep non-REM sleep, in their deep slow-wave sleep.
[01:37:08.940 --> 01:37:11.260]   And again, we think it's almost,
[01:37:11.260 --> 01:37:14.420]   we describe it as a homeostatic response,
[01:37:14.420 --> 01:37:16.180]   which is just a fancy way of saying
[01:37:16.180 --> 01:37:20.980]   that when the brain is driven to undergo a demand,
[01:37:20.980 --> 01:37:25.900]   then sleep will respond to try to accommodate that demand.
[01:37:25.900 --> 01:37:28.980]   And so I would say that there are probably
[01:37:28.980 --> 01:37:31.540]   many other things, and we discussed this in episode two
[01:37:31.540 --> 01:37:34.020]   in terms of, A, how to optimize your sleep,
[01:37:34.020 --> 01:37:37.300]   that probably carry a bigger bang for your buck
[01:37:37.300 --> 01:37:40.900]   in terms of optimizing and enhancing your sleep,
[01:37:40.900 --> 01:37:44.580]   but is there any evidence to suggest that that's the case?
[01:37:44.580 --> 01:37:47.780]   There does seem to be some evidence in the literature, yes.
[01:37:47.780 --> 01:37:51.780]   - So interesting, I certainly know the experience
[01:37:51.780 --> 01:37:54.060]   of trying to learn a lot of information
[01:37:54.060 --> 01:37:56.500]   and then feeling like my sleep is that much deeper,
[01:37:56.500 --> 01:37:58.900]   although I've also experienced the challenges
[01:37:58.900 --> 01:38:01.300]   in, quote-unquote, turning my brain off
[01:38:01.300 --> 01:38:02.700]   when I've been trying to learn something
[01:38:02.700 --> 01:38:03.980]   and then it's late in the evening,
[01:38:03.980 --> 01:38:05.620]   forget the caffeine component,
[01:38:05.620 --> 01:38:08.940]   but just the information is spooling in my head,
[01:38:08.940 --> 01:38:13.460]   maybe some pre-test anxiety, that kind of thing.
[01:38:13.460 --> 01:38:15.460]   So I think that the tools and protocols
[01:38:15.460 --> 01:38:19.100]   that you offered so generously in episodes one, two,
[01:38:19.100 --> 01:38:22.100]   and three are especially important under those conditions,
[01:38:22.100 --> 01:38:25.180]   learning how to really taper off one's level
[01:38:25.180 --> 01:38:28.140]   of thinking and planning and arousal in the evening,
[01:38:28.140 --> 01:38:31.380]   really bring things down so that one can access that sleep.
[01:38:31.380 --> 01:38:34.380]   I mean, one only wishes that the more we did during the day,
[01:38:34.380 --> 01:38:36.100]   the easier it would be to sleep.
[01:38:36.100 --> 01:38:37.860]   And I think to some extent that's true,
[01:38:37.860 --> 01:38:42.060]   but there's some conditions in which doing more,
[01:38:42.060 --> 01:38:43.700]   thinking about more,
[01:38:43.700 --> 01:38:46.360]   and I guess that's sort of the irony, right?
[01:38:46.360 --> 01:38:47.860]   I interrupted myself, but on purpose,
[01:38:47.860 --> 01:38:51.380]   that wouldn't it be wonderful if the amount and ease
[01:38:51.380 --> 01:38:53.660]   of sleep was directly proportional
[01:38:53.660 --> 01:38:55.620]   to how much we needed to sleep?
[01:38:55.620 --> 01:38:58.380]   That's one of the tricks in this whole business.
[01:38:58.380 --> 01:38:59.580]   - Fickle system sometimes.
[01:38:59.580 --> 01:39:02.500]   - Right, like sometimes when we really need sleep,
[01:39:02.500 --> 01:39:04.620]   we're dealing with something psychologically challenging,
[01:39:04.620 --> 01:39:07.680]   or we need to learn something, we have an exam,
[01:39:07.680 --> 01:39:09.860]   that often can be when it's most difficult to sleep.
[01:39:09.860 --> 01:39:12.660]   - Gets right in the way of what we need most.
[01:39:12.660 --> 01:39:14.100]   Although coming back to your point,
[01:39:14.100 --> 01:39:17.660]   I think physical activity does seem to be
[01:39:17.660 --> 01:39:19.620]   one of those things that is very good.
[01:39:19.620 --> 01:39:23.460]   And I'm remiss to have not included it
[01:39:23.460 --> 01:39:26.740]   in the optimization or the unconventional tips.
[01:39:26.740 --> 01:39:29.220]   There is a very good robust literature now
[01:39:29.220 --> 01:39:32.140]   demonstrating that if you are physically active
[01:39:32.140 --> 01:39:35.500]   during the day, you can boost the quality of your sleep,
[01:39:35.500 --> 01:39:38.520]   particularly your deep sleep at night.
[01:39:38.520 --> 01:39:42.060]   It seems to be, there are some subtle differences
[01:39:42.060 --> 01:39:45.260]   in terms of whether you're doing aerobic versus anaerobic,
[01:39:45.260 --> 01:39:47.020]   so let's say versus, you know,
[01:39:47.020 --> 01:39:49.060]   doing a spin bike class for an hour
[01:39:49.060 --> 01:39:51.020]   versus lifting resistance,
[01:39:51.020 --> 01:39:53.220]   or doing resistance training for an hour
[01:39:53.220 --> 01:39:54.500]   or strength training.
[01:39:54.500 --> 01:39:55.780]   There's subtle differences,
[01:39:55.780 --> 01:39:58.820]   but net that overall the big picture view
[01:39:58.820 --> 01:40:01.000]   is that when you perform exercise,
[01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:04.020]   you drive a response from enhanced sleep,
[01:40:04.020 --> 01:40:05.540]   particularly deep sleep at night.
[01:40:05.540 --> 01:40:07.380]   And I think many people have had that experience.
[01:40:07.380 --> 01:40:09.060]   You've been out on a long hike,
[01:40:09.060 --> 01:40:10.980]   maybe a 10, 12 mile hike,
[01:40:10.980 --> 01:40:13.780]   or you've just been working in the garden,
[01:40:13.780 --> 01:40:15.140]   doing really, you know,
[01:40:15.140 --> 01:40:18.140]   sort of long landscaping work throughout the day,
[01:40:18.140 --> 01:40:19.700]   six or seven hours.
[01:40:19.700 --> 01:40:23.060]   And you just come in and you go to bed that night
[01:40:23.060 --> 01:40:26.300]   and you just know that this is going to be
[01:40:26.300 --> 01:40:29.180]   the most Royal night of sleep that you could.
[01:40:29.320 --> 01:40:31.120]   You know it ahead of time,
[01:40:31.120 --> 01:40:34.380]   you know, sort of ear hole to elbow.
[01:40:34.380 --> 01:40:38.400]   And that evidence is now very clear.
[01:40:38.400 --> 01:40:39.680]   The one interesting thing,
[01:40:39.680 --> 01:40:41.760]   if you dig into that data though,
[01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:45.520]   you can drive increases in deep sleep by way of exercise.
[01:40:45.520 --> 01:40:49.640]   It does seem to come at a little bit of cost to REM sleep.
[01:40:49.640 --> 01:40:53.400]   Exercise may throttle back some of your REM sleep.
[01:40:53.400 --> 01:40:55.040]   Now don't fear that.
[01:40:55.040 --> 01:40:57.320]   It may just simply be that every night,
[01:40:57.320 --> 01:40:58.740]   and we know this,
[01:40:58.740 --> 01:41:01.460]   my sleep and my stages of sleep
[01:41:01.460 --> 01:41:03.980]   are going to be much different to yours
[01:41:03.980 --> 01:41:06.800]   in how they are structured and how they play out.
[01:41:06.800 --> 01:41:10.300]   But even within me, the same individual, Matt,
[01:41:10.300 --> 01:41:14.300]   my sleep stages vary from one night to the next to the next.
[01:41:14.300 --> 01:41:16.180]   Some of that is idiosyncratic.
[01:41:16.180 --> 01:41:19.180]   Others are, or other reasons depend on
[01:41:19.180 --> 01:41:21.620]   what I've been doing during the day.
[01:41:21.620 --> 01:41:23.960]   And so it may be that we don't need to get concerned
[01:41:23.960 --> 01:41:26.060]   about that modest reduction in REM
[01:41:26.060 --> 01:41:28.880]   due to exercise enhanced non-REM,
[01:41:28.880 --> 01:41:30.960]   because it's simply that when you've gone through
[01:41:30.960 --> 01:41:34.880]   that form of activity as a human being during the day,
[01:41:34.880 --> 01:41:37.080]   what you need is that type of sleep
[01:41:37.080 --> 01:41:39.840]   more so than perhaps REM sleep.
[01:41:39.840 --> 01:41:43.320]   And therefore the next night, things calibrate back down.
[01:41:43.320 --> 01:41:44.560]   Let's say I wasn't as active.
[01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:47.740]   I just sort of went to work and I'm back to baseline again.
[01:41:47.740 --> 01:41:50.440]   So I don't get too concerned about that,
[01:41:50.440 --> 01:41:51.600]   but I just want to bring it up.
[01:41:51.600 --> 01:41:52.920]   It's there in the literature.
[01:41:52.920 --> 01:41:54.920]   - Yeah, I think it's a very interesting point.
[01:41:54.920 --> 01:41:58.260]   And one just has to trust that nature knows best
[01:41:58.260 --> 01:42:02.100]   in modifying the percentage of different sleep stages
[01:42:02.100 --> 01:42:04.140]   according to our daytime activity.
[01:42:04.140 --> 01:42:07.900]   Again, highlighting the key relationship,
[01:42:07.900 --> 01:42:10.340]   I mean, the closely tethered relationship
[01:42:10.340 --> 01:42:13.540]   between daytime activity and sleep and vice versa.
[01:42:13.540 --> 01:42:14.380]   - Correct.
[01:42:14.380 --> 01:42:17.260]   Yeah, and it's a reciprocal loop
[01:42:17.260 --> 01:42:19.900]   because what we found is that exercise during the day
[01:42:19.900 --> 01:42:21.460]   can enhance sleep at night,
[01:42:21.460 --> 01:42:24.300]   but also what we found is that sleep at night
[01:42:24.300 --> 01:42:27.180]   enhances your athletic performance the following day.
[01:42:27.180 --> 01:42:29.020]   And I'm not just talking about motor skill,
[01:42:29.020 --> 01:42:30.580]   memory upstairs in the brain.
[01:42:30.580 --> 01:42:33.100]   I'm talking about physical activity in the body.
[01:42:33.100 --> 01:42:36.500]   And if you limit sleep to let's say less than six hours,
[01:42:36.500 --> 01:42:39.720]   the data demonstrates that your peak muscle performance
[01:42:39.720 --> 01:42:40.820]   is decreased.
[01:42:40.820 --> 01:42:43.900]   Your peak vertical jump height decreases.
[01:42:43.900 --> 01:42:46.580]   Your time to exhaustion decreases.
[01:42:46.580 --> 01:42:49.020]   In some cities, it was up to 30%.
[01:42:49.020 --> 01:42:51.060]   So if you're training for a 10K marathon,
[01:42:51.060 --> 01:42:52.780]   but you don't get enough sleep the night before,
[01:42:52.780 --> 01:42:54.900]   you're done by seven.
[01:42:54.900 --> 01:42:56.660]   We also know that it decreases
[01:42:56.660 --> 01:42:59.420]   perhaps more than almost any of those.
[01:42:59.420 --> 01:43:04.420]   And it's striking the brain's motivation to exercise at all.
[01:43:04.420 --> 01:43:09.340]   So in fact, many people may be able to get close
[01:43:09.340 --> 01:43:12.660]   to their peak muscle strength when they are underslept.
[01:43:12.660 --> 01:43:14.540]   Chances are they're probably never going to get
[01:43:14.540 --> 01:43:16.300]   to the chance to express that
[01:43:16.300 --> 01:43:18.980]   because their motivation to exercise just drops off.
[01:43:18.980 --> 01:43:20.580]   And I think many people will resonate
[01:43:20.580 --> 01:43:22.060]   that you had a bad night of sleep.
[01:43:22.060 --> 01:43:24.500]   I just don't want to go to the gym the next day.
[01:43:24.500 --> 01:43:26.660]   The final part of that is injury risk.
[01:43:26.660 --> 01:43:28.940]   There is a significantly elevated injury risk.
[01:43:28.940 --> 01:43:31.420]   And if you ask most athletes,
[01:43:31.420 --> 01:43:34.020]   okay, what am I particularly concerned about?
[01:43:34.020 --> 01:43:35.620]   Is it my performance?
[01:43:35.620 --> 01:43:37.620]   Or if I had some kind of injury,
[01:43:37.620 --> 01:43:39.980]   that knocks me out for the rest of the season.
[01:43:39.980 --> 01:43:42.420]   And so I've had the fortunate chance to work
[01:43:42.420 --> 01:43:45.860]   with many professional teams of different kinds.
[01:43:45.860 --> 01:43:49.380]   And gradually they are realizing what I sort of long said,
[01:43:49.380 --> 01:43:50.500]   and it's a crass statement,
[01:43:50.500 --> 01:43:53.180]   but I think sleep is probably the greatest
[01:43:53.180 --> 01:43:55.100]   legal performance enhancing drug
[01:43:55.100 --> 01:43:58.180]   that most athletes are not abusing enough.
[01:43:58.180 --> 01:43:59.660]   - I could not agree more.
[01:43:59.660 --> 01:44:01.900]   I mean, I feel like every time I say sleep
[01:44:01.900 --> 01:44:03.220]   is the bedrock of mental health,
[01:44:03.220 --> 01:44:04.820]   physical health and performance,
[01:44:04.820 --> 01:44:09.780]   it's sometimes perceived as just kind of like,
[01:44:09.780 --> 01:44:12.060]   oh yeah, sleep, we need to sleep.
[01:44:12.060 --> 01:44:16.020]   But there's no question that the positive effects
[01:44:16.020 --> 01:44:18.980]   of getting excellent sleep on a consistent basis,
[01:44:19.860 --> 01:44:23.980]   far out way and perform any kind of supplement
[01:44:23.980 --> 01:44:25.620]   or even performance enhancing drug.
[01:44:25.620 --> 01:44:28.740]   In fact, most supplements and performance enhancing drugs
[01:44:28.740 --> 01:44:32.900]   that can indeed improve performance of various kinds
[01:44:32.900 --> 01:44:35.460]   seem to only function or function best,
[01:44:35.460 --> 01:44:38.420]   certainly on a backdrop of excellent sleep.
[01:44:38.420 --> 01:44:41.780]   And I should say that I think you've done a brilliant job
[01:44:41.780 --> 01:44:44.660]   of being very explicit about the fact
[01:44:44.660 --> 01:44:48.460]   that you need to get all of the basics in place.
[01:44:48.460 --> 01:44:50.820]   And then it's great to think about fine tweaking
[01:44:50.820 --> 01:44:53.540]   with optimization of things like supplementation
[01:44:53.540 --> 01:44:55.300]   and all these other things.
[01:44:55.300 --> 01:44:57.380]   And I think sometimes that message has been
[01:44:57.380 --> 01:45:01.500]   maybe a little bit more mixed in the social media environment
[01:45:01.500 --> 01:45:04.940]   that we often don't think about the basics
[01:45:04.940 --> 01:45:07.700]   and we go straight to supplementation where you would say,
[01:45:07.700 --> 01:45:11.180]   gosh, there's actually a log order of magnitude benefit
[01:45:11.180 --> 01:45:12.500]   that's on the table.
[01:45:12.500 --> 01:45:14.500]   If only you had to do some of the basic things
[01:45:14.500 --> 01:45:17.580]   that your grandmother would probably tell you.
[01:45:17.580 --> 01:45:20.540]   Eat right, get your stress sorted out,
[01:45:20.540 --> 01:45:21.740]   do some physical activity
[01:45:21.740 --> 01:45:23.100]   and make sure that you get some sleep.
[01:45:23.100 --> 01:45:25.380]   Do those things and you're very far along.
[01:45:25.380 --> 01:45:27.260]   Now there's more opportunity on the table
[01:45:27.260 --> 01:45:30.100]   for fine tuning as you've elegantly discussed.
[01:45:30.100 --> 01:45:31.580]   But I think I just want to acknowledge
[01:45:31.580 --> 01:45:34.060]   that I think you've done a really great job
[01:45:34.060 --> 01:45:36.420]   of being balanced in that message.
[01:45:36.420 --> 01:45:39.820]   And I hope people in the general sphere
[01:45:39.820 --> 01:45:42.580]   can appreciate how hard that is to do.
[01:45:42.580 --> 01:45:43.860]   It's not an easy thing
[01:45:43.860 --> 01:45:45.500]   when you are talking about supplementation
[01:45:45.500 --> 01:45:47.820]   because at first it sounds as though, gosh,
[01:45:47.820 --> 01:45:50.380]   all of the speak and you describe great data
[01:45:50.380 --> 01:45:55.380]   means that it is the holy grail of enhanced human beings.
[01:45:55.380 --> 01:45:59.100]   But you're always careful to say this after the foundation.
[01:45:59.100 --> 01:46:01.860]   And I can give a very good example with sleep.
[01:46:01.860 --> 01:46:03.940]   Let's say that you're trying to manage your weight
[01:46:03.940 --> 01:46:06.900]   and lose weight and you're dieting,
[01:46:06.900 --> 01:46:09.020]   but you're not getting sufficient sleep.
[01:46:09.020 --> 01:46:11.180]   What we've discovered is that yes,
[01:46:11.180 --> 01:46:14.820]   you will lose weight when you're dieting,
[01:46:14.820 --> 01:46:16.500]   even though you're not getting enough sleep.
[01:46:16.500 --> 01:46:20.820]   The problem is that almost 60% of the weight that you lose
[01:46:20.820 --> 01:46:25.460]   will come from lean muscle mass and not fat.
[01:46:25.460 --> 01:46:28.620]   In other words, when you are underslept and dieting,
[01:46:28.620 --> 01:46:31.740]   you keep what you're trying to lose, which is the fat,
[01:46:31.740 --> 01:46:35.380]   and you lose what you wish to keep, which is the muscle.
[01:46:35.380 --> 01:46:38.140]   So your body does something very interesting
[01:46:38.140 --> 01:46:43.140]   in its removal of different types of energy stores
[01:46:43.740 --> 01:46:46.580]   in your body when you are not slept.
[01:46:46.580 --> 01:46:48.780]   It becomes very stingy with fat
[01:46:48.780 --> 01:46:52.580]   and it will not give it up when you are sleep deprived,
[01:46:52.580 --> 01:46:53.420]   which is very interesting.
[01:46:53.420 --> 01:46:55.460]   Why would that be, by the way?
[01:46:55.460 --> 01:46:58.100]   - Muscle is such a metabolically demanding tissue.
[01:46:58.100 --> 01:47:00.980]   By not sleeping well, you're sending signals
[01:47:00.980 --> 01:47:02.860]   that there really isn't the capacity to take care
[01:47:02.860 --> 01:47:03.860]   of what you already have,
[01:47:03.860 --> 01:47:07.020]   much less increase the size of the engine.
[01:47:07.020 --> 01:47:07.940]   - That's exactly right.
[01:47:07.940 --> 01:47:12.300]   And then think about fat, which is in terms of its energy,
[01:47:12.300 --> 01:47:16.780]   unit benefit, it has at least perhaps twice
[01:47:16.780 --> 01:47:19.500]   the caloric value that protein does.
[01:47:19.500 --> 01:47:22.220]   So if you are underslept, that is a warning sign
[01:47:22.220 --> 01:47:26.880]   to any evolutionary species past that things are dire.
[01:47:26.880 --> 01:47:29.940]   So whatever I'm going to do, this is break glass
[01:47:29.940 --> 01:47:32.300]   in case of emergency situation.
[01:47:32.300 --> 01:47:34.740]   And if you're not getting enough calories,
[01:47:34.740 --> 01:47:36.140]   I'm gonna hold onto the thing
[01:47:36.140 --> 01:47:40.240]   that has the highest caloric value right until the end,
[01:47:40.240 --> 01:47:43.340]   which is fat, and I'm going to give away the stuff
[01:47:43.340 --> 01:47:45.780]   that doesn't have as much caloric benefit
[01:47:45.780 --> 01:47:48.900]   because I am in a caloric deficit right now.
[01:47:48.900 --> 01:47:49.940]   Now, of course, that's strange
[01:47:49.940 --> 01:47:51.700]   because the person trying to lose weight
[01:47:51.700 --> 01:47:54.400]   perhaps is rightfully trying to lose weight
[01:47:54.400 --> 01:47:57.180]   based on them being somewhat overweight.
[01:47:57.180 --> 01:48:00.040]   But that's the biology that we think explains
[01:48:00.040 --> 01:48:01.280]   why that that's the case.
[01:48:01.280 --> 01:48:03.140]   It's not just a strange phenomenon.
[01:48:03.140 --> 01:48:04.860]   It's a very logical one.
[01:48:04.860 --> 01:48:06.060]   - Yeah, it is a logical one.
[01:48:06.060 --> 01:48:10.480]   And thanks for the support around, you know,
[01:48:10.480 --> 01:48:14.480]   my constant voicing and revoicing
[01:48:14.480 --> 01:48:16.920]   of the pillars of health that you mentioned,
[01:48:16.920 --> 01:48:17.920]   you know, exercise, sleep.
[01:48:17.920 --> 01:48:20.080]   Well, I put it in the order of sleep
[01:48:20.080 --> 01:48:22.340]   as the most important pillar.
[01:48:22.340 --> 01:48:25.560]   And then one could argue about the order of the others,
[01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:30.200]   but in no specific order, light, which dovetails with sleep,
[01:48:30.200 --> 01:48:35.200]   but nutrition, movement, exercise, social connection,
[01:48:35.480 --> 01:48:37.540]   stress modulation, these kinds of things.
[01:48:37.540 --> 01:48:39.660]   - Yeah, the fact that the speed with which
[01:48:39.660 --> 01:48:41.300]   that comes out of your mouth tells you
[01:48:41.300 --> 01:48:44.060]   how many times you've said it
[01:48:44.060 --> 01:48:45.340]   and you've said it over and over.
[01:48:45.340 --> 01:48:46.300]   It's wonderful.
[01:48:46.300 --> 01:48:47.120]   - Well, thank you.
[01:48:47.120 --> 01:48:49.100]   It's interesting because they are the basics,
[01:48:49.100 --> 01:48:52.740]   but they are basics that need to be re-upped every 24 hours.
[01:48:52.740 --> 01:48:55.060]   And so often I feel like we all need
[01:48:55.060 --> 01:48:57.220]   to be reminded every 24 hours.
[01:48:57.220 --> 01:49:00.020]   I also, you know, one of the most common questions I get
[01:49:00.020 --> 01:49:01.480]   is what should I take?
[01:49:01.480 --> 01:49:02.780]   People are like, if I had a dollar
[01:49:02.780 --> 01:49:04.460]   for every time somebody said, what should I take?
[01:49:04.460 --> 01:49:08.820]   You know, I'd keep podcasting, but I'd be a gazillionaire.
[01:49:08.820 --> 01:49:10.300]   But my response is always the same,
[01:49:10.300 --> 01:49:11.980]   which is how's your sleep?
[01:49:11.980 --> 01:49:13.400]   The first question I say is how's your sleep?
[01:49:13.400 --> 01:49:15.300]   And then they think I'm going to suggest a sleep supplement,
[01:49:15.300 --> 01:49:17.680]   but I want to know whether or not people are sleeping well
[01:49:17.680 --> 01:49:18.620]   on a consistent basis.
[01:49:18.620 --> 01:49:21.400]   And that opens up a whole set of discussions.
[01:49:21.400 --> 01:49:23.540]   And then inevitably we forget
[01:49:23.540 --> 01:49:25.960]   about what one should take conversation.
[01:49:25.960 --> 01:49:29.540]   I think it's the rare individual who's sleeping very well
[01:49:29.540 --> 01:49:30.400]   every night of their life.
[01:49:30.400 --> 01:49:31.540]   There are such individuals.
[01:49:31.540 --> 01:49:34.400]   And then the what should I take conversation makes sense.
[01:49:34.400 --> 01:49:35.700]   In a certain context.
[01:49:35.700 --> 01:49:38.580]   There's something I wanted to just return to for a moment
[01:49:38.580 --> 01:49:41.380]   before I move on to the next topic,
[01:49:41.380 --> 01:49:45.860]   which is you mentioned all the significant deficits
[01:49:45.860 --> 01:49:47.860]   that occur in motor performance
[01:49:47.860 --> 01:49:50.140]   when one has not slept that well the night before.
[01:49:50.140 --> 01:49:54.020]   Grip, strength, vertical jump, motivation, et cetera.
[01:49:54.020 --> 01:49:59.540]   You know, we're not here to deliver anything
[01:49:59.540 --> 01:50:01.900]   except the facts to people.
[01:50:01.900 --> 01:50:05.440]   And we're certainly not here to soften the blow of reality.
[01:50:05.440 --> 01:50:07.320]   But there are a good number of people
[01:50:07.320 --> 01:50:09.880]   that will have say a physical performance, like a race,
[01:50:09.880 --> 01:50:11.560]   they're training for a half marathon,
[01:50:11.560 --> 01:50:14.760]   or they have a big game the next day,
[01:50:14.760 --> 01:50:18.100]   or they have some performance event the next day.
[01:50:18.100 --> 01:50:22.800]   And by virtue of butterflies, anxiety, travel,
[01:50:22.800 --> 01:50:25.240]   an alarm going off in a hotel in the middle of the night,
[01:50:25.240 --> 01:50:26.980]   I've had that experience, et cetera,
[01:50:26.980 --> 01:50:29.520]   that they may not get the best night's sleep
[01:50:29.520 --> 01:50:30.640]   the night before.
[01:50:31.500 --> 01:50:34.660]   And obviously there are going to be ramifications of that.
[01:50:34.660 --> 01:50:38.960]   But I'm reminded of a study that was done
[01:50:38.960 --> 01:50:42.060]   by Ali Crum's lab at Stanford,
[01:50:42.060 --> 01:50:45.760]   where people wear sleep trackers.
[01:50:45.760 --> 01:50:50.580]   And they actually knew how much
[01:50:50.580 --> 01:50:53.900]   and how well or poorly they slept the night before.
[01:50:53.900 --> 01:50:55.380]   I don't know how detailed the analysis was,
[01:50:55.380 --> 01:50:56.500]   but it was Stanford Sleep Center,
[01:50:56.500 --> 01:50:58.980]   so presumably it was reasonably detailed.
[01:50:58.980 --> 01:51:02.860]   And then the next day, with that knowledge in hand,
[01:51:02.860 --> 01:51:07.580]   either lied to the people or told them the truth
[01:51:07.580 --> 01:51:10.000]   about how well they had slept the night before or poorly.
[01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:11.740]   For instance, if someone had got eight hours
[01:51:11.740 --> 01:51:13.360]   of great sleep the night before,
[01:51:13.360 --> 01:51:14.560]   they might've told them,
[01:51:14.560 --> 01:51:16.460]   "Hey, you got eight hours of great sleep the night before."
[01:51:16.460 --> 01:51:18.420]   Or they might've been in a condition where they said,
[01:51:18.420 --> 01:51:19.260]   "Hey, you know what?
[01:51:19.260 --> 01:51:21.820]   Your sleep last night wasn't that great."
[01:51:21.820 --> 01:51:24.040]   Or if somebody got five hours of sleep,
[01:51:24.040 --> 01:51:25.460]   they might've said, "Hey, you know,
[01:51:25.460 --> 01:51:26.820]   you got eight hours of great sleep."
[01:51:26.820 --> 01:51:29.620]   So there was a lot of lying involved in this study.
[01:51:29.620 --> 01:51:33.780]   But basically what they observed is that performance in,
[01:51:33.780 --> 01:51:35.700]   I think it was motor skill performance,
[01:51:35.700 --> 01:51:36.700]   but it might've been cognitive,
[01:51:36.700 --> 01:51:39.040]   but that's not the issue here.
[01:51:39.040 --> 01:51:42.820]   The point is that much of our performance can be dependent
[01:51:42.820 --> 01:51:45.400]   on our subjective understanding
[01:51:45.400 --> 01:51:49.380]   of how well or poorly we slept the night before.
[01:51:49.380 --> 01:51:51.620]   In other words, there can be belief effects.
[01:51:51.620 --> 01:51:52.460]   - That's right.
[01:51:52.460 --> 01:51:53.740]   - So this is one of the concerns
[01:51:53.740 --> 01:51:57.140]   about placing too much emphasis
[01:51:57.140 --> 01:52:00.280]   on the one poor night's sleep.
[01:52:00.280 --> 01:52:02.620]   You know, and obviously people should be mindful of injury,
[01:52:02.620 --> 01:52:03.460]   as you pointed out,
[01:52:03.460 --> 01:52:06.620]   but if someone has a big race or a big event the next day
[01:52:06.620 --> 01:52:08.340]   and they just don't sleep well,
[01:52:08.340 --> 01:52:12.040]   we have to be careful that the mere knowledge
[01:52:12.040 --> 01:52:14.220]   that they're not going to perform as well,
[01:52:14.220 --> 01:52:15.820]   because that's what the data say,
[01:52:15.820 --> 01:52:21.780]   can potentially be offset by the Ali Crum study,
[01:52:21.780 --> 01:52:22.900]   which is if they believe like,
[01:52:22.900 --> 01:52:24.780]   "Hey, a lot of it is about what they believe
[01:52:24.780 --> 01:52:26.060]   "about their own sleep to be,"
[01:52:26.060 --> 01:52:29.500]   which just tells you that performance can,
[01:52:29.500 --> 01:52:31.260]   and motivation presumably,
[01:52:31.260 --> 01:52:33.620]   can override some of the physiology.
[01:52:33.620 --> 01:52:35.060]   There's, you know, and again,
[01:52:35.060 --> 01:52:37.820]   you can't rescue what you can't rescue.
[01:52:37.820 --> 01:52:39.460]   - No, and I think it's a very good point
[01:52:39.460 --> 01:52:40.900]   because it comes back to our discussion
[01:52:40.900 --> 01:52:42.700]   about the placebo effect in some ways,
[01:52:42.700 --> 01:52:45.180]   which is this is mind over matter
[01:52:45.180 --> 01:52:46.940]   and that your biological state.
[01:52:46.940 --> 01:52:48.340]   So one of the things I do
[01:52:48.340 --> 01:52:50.740]   when I'm working with professional athletes
[01:52:50.740 --> 01:52:52.260]   and we're doing sleep tracking,
[01:52:52.260 --> 01:52:54.780]   often I'm working with a coach
[01:52:54.780 --> 01:52:56.420]   and I will say during that period
[01:52:56.420 --> 01:52:59.820]   where they're on the road
[01:52:59.820 --> 01:53:03.620]   and now they've got seven games to play in the playoffs,
[01:53:03.620 --> 01:53:05.140]   let's keep tracking their sleep
[01:53:05.140 --> 01:53:06.700]   and let's you and I make sure
[01:53:06.700 --> 01:53:09.340]   that we're trying to optimize this athlete,
[01:53:09.340 --> 01:53:10.820]   because they've given consent,
[01:53:10.820 --> 01:53:13.220]   they want to have their sleep as good as possible
[01:53:13.220 --> 01:53:15.420]   and they want us to help them do that.
[01:53:15.420 --> 01:53:16.940]   But I say at that point,
[01:53:16.940 --> 01:53:19.940]   we will simply look at the data night after night
[01:53:19.940 --> 01:53:21.740]   and then we can describe the data
[01:53:21.740 --> 01:53:23.900]   that they've been having at the end of the week
[01:53:23.900 --> 01:53:26.380]   after they finished the series.
[01:53:26.380 --> 01:53:28.420]   Because for exactly that reason,
[01:53:28.420 --> 01:53:29.820]   if you start giving them feedback,
[01:53:29.820 --> 01:53:32.100]   we don't want to erode confidence.
[01:53:32.100 --> 01:53:33.300]   And with sleep trackers,
[01:53:33.300 --> 01:53:36.540]   there is such a thing called orthosomnia
[01:53:36.540 --> 01:53:39.780]   and it's now a described situation.
[01:53:39.780 --> 01:53:45.020]   Orthosomnia in medicine words mean something.
[01:53:45.020 --> 01:53:49.100]   So ortho people will be familiar with in medicine,
[01:53:49.100 --> 01:53:51.100]   orthopedics, orthodontics,
[01:53:51.100 --> 01:53:53.140]   it's about getting things straight.
[01:53:53.140 --> 01:53:56.140]   Orthopedics, getting your sort of bone straight,
[01:53:56.140 --> 01:53:58.180]   orthodontics, getting your teeth straight.
[01:53:58.180 --> 01:54:01.940]   Orthosomnia is about trying to get your sleep straight
[01:54:01.940 --> 01:54:03.620]   and being so worried about that,
[01:54:03.620 --> 01:54:05.740]   that it compromises your sleep.
[01:54:05.740 --> 01:54:08.340]   Now we don't know exactly what proportion of people,
[01:54:08.340 --> 01:54:11.460]   it may be less than 10% who use sleep trackers,
[01:54:11.460 --> 01:54:13.860]   but I would say that to anyone listening,
[01:54:13.860 --> 01:54:17.380]   if you are tracking your sleep with a tracker
[01:54:17.380 --> 01:54:19.980]   and you're experiencing the sleep related anxiety,
[01:54:19.980 --> 01:54:21.300]   do one of two things.
[01:54:21.300 --> 01:54:22.820]   First, take my recommendation,
[01:54:22.820 --> 01:54:26.220]   which is that only on let's say a Sunday afternoon,
[01:54:26.220 --> 01:54:28.580]   do you open up the app and check your data.
[01:54:28.580 --> 01:54:30.420]   So that way you can still be measuring your sleep,
[01:54:30.420 --> 01:54:32.180]   which is very helpful,
[01:54:32.180 --> 01:54:35.540]   but you don't have to get the anxiety morning after morning.
[01:54:35.540 --> 01:54:37.940]   The other is that if you are truly starting
[01:54:37.940 --> 01:54:40.060]   to get a very negative experience,
[01:54:40.060 --> 01:54:42.220]   take it off, put it in the drawer
[01:54:42.220 --> 01:54:44.940]   and just get your sleep confidence back
[01:54:44.940 --> 01:54:47.300]   using some of the suggestions that we had
[01:54:47.300 --> 01:54:48.980]   in the optimization episode.
[01:54:48.980 --> 01:54:52.420]   And only then return to using that tracker.
[01:54:52.420 --> 01:54:53.740]   What's also interesting,
[01:54:53.740 --> 01:54:55.260]   it relates to what you were saying
[01:54:55.260 --> 01:54:57.940]   about beliefs and intention.
[01:54:57.940 --> 01:54:59.820]   They did another great study
[01:54:59.820 --> 01:55:01.980]   where they looked at this cortisol rise in the morning
[01:55:01.980 --> 01:55:04.620]   that you and I have discussed on this series many times,
[01:55:04.620 --> 01:55:07.700]   which starts to happen sort of just before you're waking up
[01:55:07.700 --> 01:55:09.660]   and really rises into the morning.
[01:55:09.660 --> 01:55:13.220]   What they did was they brought participants
[01:55:13.220 --> 01:55:16.100]   into the laboratory and they had them go to sleep
[01:55:16.100 --> 01:55:18.940]   at around 11 o'clock at night.
[01:55:18.940 --> 01:55:20.180]   And then in one group, they said,
[01:55:20.180 --> 01:55:23.140]   we're going to wake you up at 7 a.m. in the morning.
[01:55:23.140 --> 01:55:23.980]   The other group, they said,
[01:55:23.980 --> 01:55:27.420]   we're going to wake you up at 5 a.m. in the morning.
[01:55:27.420 --> 01:55:30.460]   Well, it turns out that both of those groups
[01:55:30.460 --> 01:55:33.220]   were woken up at 7 a.m.
[01:55:33.220 --> 01:55:35.740]   But what was bizarre is that in the group
[01:55:35.740 --> 01:55:40.140]   that was told they were going to wake up at 5 a.m.,
[01:55:40.140 --> 01:55:45.140]   their cortisol release started to rise around 5 a.m.
[01:55:45.940 --> 01:55:49.460]   In other words, just the knowledge before sleep
[01:55:49.460 --> 01:55:52.460]   that you're going to be woken up at 5 a.m.
[01:55:52.460 --> 01:55:56.140]   changed the non-conscious brain's release
[01:55:56.140 --> 01:56:01.100]   of a stock standard prototypical hormonal release mechanism.
[01:56:01.100 --> 01:56:02.940]   And that comes right back to this idea
[01:56:02.940 --> 01:56:05.660]   that we were speaking about with time,
[01:56:05.660 --> 01:56:09.020]   that consciously we have lost time perception
[01:56:09.020 --> 01:56:11.140]   when we're sleeping, but non-consciously,
[01:56:11.140 --> 01:56:13.820]   it seems as though the brain is still knowing
[01:56:13.820 --> 01:56:16.300]   what's going on because for that early morning flight,
[01:56:16.300 --> 01:56:18.660]   you wake up two minutes before your alarm.
[01:56:18.660 --> 01:56:22.380]   Well, perhaps the reason why is that you've learned
[01:56:22.380 --> 01:56:24.260]   that you have to wake up at that time
[01:56:24.260 --> 01:56:26.820]   and you've changed your cortisol response,
[01:56:26.820 --> 01:56:28.940]   which would normally, because you don't wake up
[01:56:28.940 --> 01:56:31.020]   for an early morning flight every day,
[01:56:31.020 --> 01:56:33.020]   would normally not come for two hours,
[01:56:33.020 --> 01:56:35.020]   but it's arriving earlier.
[01:56:35.020 --> 01:56:36.380]   It just blew me away.
[01:56:36.380 --> 01:56:39.500]   I couldn't believe that the brain non-consciously
[01:56:39.500 --> 01:56:41.580]   could change a hormonal profile
[01:56:41.580 --> 01:56:43.500]   simply based on me telling you
[01:56:43.500 --> 01:56:45.980]   what time you're going to wake up the next morning.
[01:56:45.980 --> 01:56:46.940]   - Spectacular.
[01:56:46.940 --> 01:56:48.740]   And really, as you pointed out,
[01:56:48.740 --> 01:56:51.380]   really speaks to the fact that during sleep,
[01:56:51.380 --> 01:56:53.460]   there is a lot of processing going on,
[01:56:53.460 --> 01:56:57.540]   subconscious, unconscious, cognitive processing.
[01:56:57.540 --> 01:56:59.820]   And we know this in the form of dreams,
[01:56:59.820 --> 01:57:01.540]   a topic that we'll talk about
[01:57:01.540 --> 01:57:03.700]   in a subsequent episode of this series.
[01:57:03.700 --> 01:57:07.060]   But okay, so you've shared with us the clear value
[01:57:07.060 --> 01:57:09.140]   of getting the best possible night's sleep
[01:57:09.140 --> 01:57:11.500]   before what I call a bout of learning.
[01:57:11.500 --> 01:57:12.900]   - Yeah.
[01:57:12.900 --> 01:57:15.300]   - You also shared with us the clear value
[01:57:15.300 --> 01:57:17.980]   of getting sleep after being exposed
[01:57:17.980 --> 01:57:22.980]   to some new information, aka a bout of learning.
[01:57:22.980 --> 01:57:25.780]   And you've explained to us the key relationship
[01:57:25.780 --> 01:57:28.980]   between sleep and motor learning,
[01:57:28.980 --> 01:57:31.060]   learning of new motor skills.
[01:57:31.060 --> 01:57:35.020]   What are some other aspects of brain and cognition
[01:57:35.020 --> 01:57:40.020]   for which sleep exerts a significant positive effect?
[01:57:40.020 --> 01:57:43.860]   - So those for a while were the first two things
[01:57:43.860 --> 01:57:45.100]   that we really thought sleep was doing
[01:57:45.100 --> 01:57:46.660]   for learning and memory.
[01:57:46.660 --> 01:57:48.860]   Sleep before learning to make those memories,
[01:57:48.860 --> 01:57:52.060]   sleep after learning to consolidate them
[01:57:52.060 --> 01:57:53.900]   and hit the save button.
[01:57:53.900 --> 01:57:56.620]   But then data started to emerge
[01:57:56.620 --> 01:57:58.860]   and we started to look at this too,
[01:57:58.860 --> 01:58:01.340]   that sleep was much more intelligent
[01:58:01.340 --> 01:58:02.500]   than we ever imagined
[01:58:02.500 --> 01:58:04.740]   when it comes to information processing.
[01:58:04.740 --> 01:58:08.580]   Sleep doesn't simply just strengthen individual memories
[01:58:08.580 --> 01:58:12.020]   like isolate islands and connected.
[01:58:12.020 --> 01:58:14.340]   Sleep after learning
[01:58:14.340 --> 01:58:17.740]   is almost a form of informational alchemy
[01:58:17.740 --> 01:58:20.420]   that sleep will take these new memories
[01:58:20.420 --> 01:58:22.500]   and it will start to interconnect them
[01:58:22.500 --> 01:58:26.220]   and cross-link them with the new information
[01:58:26.220 --> 01:58:27.060]   that you've learned,
[01:58:27.060 --> 01:58:28.660]   because usually information that you're learning
[01:58:28.660 --> 01:58:30.820]   during the day is interconnected
[01:58:30.820 --> 01:58:32.500]   and sleep was building those connections
[01:58:32.500 --> 01:58:34.140]   between new memories,
[01:58:34.140 --> 01:58:36.980]   but also it was integrating them
[01:58:36.980 --> 01:58:38.500]   into the back catalog
[01:58:38.500 --> 01:58:42.660]   of all of your past autobiographical memory systems
[01:58:42.660 --> 01:58:44.860]   so that you woke up the next day
[01:58:44.860 --> 01:58:49.860]   and you had a revised mind wide web of associations.
[01:58:49.860 --> 01:58:51.940]   And a good example of this,
[01:58:51.940 --> 01:58:55.140]   we did a study, gosh, very early on
[01:58:55.140 --> 01:58:56.460]   where we asked the question,
[01:58:56.460 --> 01:58:58.700]   which stage of sleep then is important
[01:58:58.700 --> 01:59:00.900]   for this type of,
[01:59:00.900 --> 01:59:04.140]   I almost think of it as a strange analogy,
[01:59:04.140 --> 01:59:07.300]   but almost like group therapy for memories
[01:59:07.300 --> 01:59:09.220]   that at the end of the day,
[01:59:09.220 --> 01:59:12.340]   every new memory gets a name badge
[01:59:12.340 --> 01:59:15.300]   and sleep gathers in all of these memories
[01:59:15.300 --> 01:59:16.660]   into the same room.
[01:59:16.660 --> 01:59:18.740]   And it forces you, however,
[01:59:18.740 --> 01:59:19.660]   to speak to the people,
[01:59:19.660 --> 01:59:20.740]   not at the front of the room
[01:59:20.740 --> 01:59:23.140]   that you think you've got the most obvious connection with,
[01:59:23.140 --> 01:59:24.500]   it forces you to speak to the people
[01:59:24.500 --> 01:59:25.620]   all the way at the back of the room
[01:59:25.620 --> 01:59:26.820]   that you don't think you've got really
[01:59:26.820 --> 01:59:28.380]   any connection with at all,
[01:59:28.380 --> 01:59:31.020]   but it turns out that you do
[01:59:31.020 --> 01:59:34.180]   because sleep doesn't simply build associations
[01:59:34.180 --> 01:59:35.740]   and connections, it does.
[01:59:35.740 --> 01:59:37.100]   It seems to bias the brain
[01:59:37.100 --> 01:59:41.020]   towards building the most non-obvious distant associations.
[01:59:41.020 --> 01:59:46.100]   It's almost like a Google search gone wrong
[01:59:46.100 --> 01:59:48.940]   that during the waking day,
[01:59:48.940 --> 01:59:50.540]   our memories, which are still,
[01:59:50.540 --> 01:59:51.940]   our brains are still associative
[01:59:51.940 --> 01:59:54.820]   in how they can build links and connections.
[01:59:54.820 --> 01:59:57.220]   That's like page one of the Google search.
[01:59:57.220 --> 02:00:00.660]   So let's say that I type in, you know, Andrew Huberman
[02:00:00.660 --> 02:00:02.140]   and the first page I get,
[02:00:02.140 --> 02:00:05.180]   the first hit is the Huberman Lab website, great.
[02:00:05.180 --> 02:00:08.140]   But if I go to page 20,
[02:00:08.140 --> 02:00:11.100]   it's about a field hockey game in Utah.
[02:00:11.100 --> 02:00:13.620]   And I think, heck in a second, what's Andrew doing?
[02:00:13.620 --> 02:00:14.460]   - You didn't know?
[02:00:14.460 --> 02:00:15.620]   - But yeah, I know exactly.
[02:00:15.620 --> 02:00:16.980]   - I don't think I've ever played field hockey.
[02:00:16.980 --> 02:00:18.820]   I've been to Utah, it's a beautiful state.
[02:00:18.820 --> 02:00:20.220]   - Oh, it's beautiful.
[02:00:20.220 --> 02:00:22.540]   But if I look, I can actually see that
[02:00:22.540 --> 02:00:25.140]   there is a very distant non-obvious association.
[02:00:25.140 --> 02:00:26.980]   I can understand why it's there.
[02:00:26.980 --> 02:00:31.540]   That's what sleep seems to be over indexing for
[02:00:31.540 --> 02:00:33.340]   in this associational framework.
[02:00:33.340 --> 02:00:35.660]   So then we asked, well, what is it about sleep?
[02:00:35.660 --> 02:00:40.580]   So we had participants perform anagram solving tasks.
[02:00:40.580 --> 02:00:43.180]   And anagrams are simply these words that are,
[02:00:43.180 --> 02:00:44.540]   the letters are all jumbled up
[02:00:44.540 --> 02:00:47.140]   and you have to kind of stare at them or work through them.
[02:00:47.140 --> 02:00:51.260]   And all of a sudden you start to see which word it really is
[02:00:51.260 --> 02:00:54.700]   because at first it's all jumbled up and it makes no sense.
[02:00:54.700 --> 02:00:57.900]   But we didn't teach them it before sleep and after sleep.
[02:00:57.900 --> 02:00:59.340]   We did something different.
[02:00:59.340 --> 02:01:02.100]   We woke them up out of different stages of sleep.
[02:01:02.100 --> 02:01:03.100]   Why?
[02:01:03.100 --> 02:01:07.140]   Well, when you come out of different stages of sleep,
[02:01:07.140 --> 02:01:09.980]   there is still some degree of the biology
[02:01:09.980 --> 02:01:13.820]   of that sleep state that lingers in your brain,
[02:01:13.820 --> 02:01:16.380]   almost like vapors coming off the stage of sleep
[02:01:16.380 --> 02:01:17.980]   that you've just exited.
[02:01:17.980 --> 02:01:20.980]   And it only lasts for about two minutes or so.
[02:01:20.980 --> 02:01:23.420]   But what was nice is that this anagram test
[02:01:23.420 --> 02:01:25.540]   you could do within two minutes.
[02:01:25.540 --> 02:01:28.580]   So we would wake them up out of different stages of sleep
[02:01:28.580 --> 02:01:32.220]   and then we'd have them quickly do these anagrams.
[02:01:32.220 --> 02:01:35.540]   And I told you that for fact-based memory,
[02:01:35.540 --> 02:01:37.460]   that sleep after learning was important
[02:01:37.460 --> 02:01:40.020]   to strengthen the individual memories.
[02:01:40.020 --> 02:01:42.740]   And it was particularly non-rapid eye movement sleep
[02:01:42.740 --> 02:01:46.180]   that was doing that strengthening of the individual facts.
[02:01:46.180 --> 02:01:50.620]   Now what we found is that the association creativity benefit
[02:01:50.620 --> 02:01:52.740]   of sleep was very different.
[02:01:52.740 --> 02:01:55.060]   That cross-linking benefit came by way,
[02:01:55.060 --> 02:01:56.540]   it seemed, of REM sleep.
[02:01:56.540 --> 02:01:58.500]   Because when we woke them up out of REM sleep
[02:01:58.500 --> 02:01:59.980]   compared to non-REM sleep,
[02:01:59.980 --> 02:02:04.820]   they were 30% more capable of solving these anagrams.
[02:02:04.820 --> 02:02:07.300]   And when we looked at how they were solving them,
[02:02:07.300 --> 02:02:08.460]   it was interesting.
[02:02:08.460 --> 02:02:09.740]   Coming out of non-REM sleep,
[02:02:09.740 --> 02:02:12.540]   it was very sort of analogical.
[02:02:12.540 --> 02:02:17.140]   It was very, what we think of as very sort of convergent,
[02:02:17.140 --> 02:02:22.140]   very focused way of trying to logically solve the problem.
[02:02:22.140 --> 02:02:23.380]   But with REM sleep,
[02:02:23.380 --> 02:02:26.580]   it was much more divergent fluid intelligence.
[02:02:26.580 --> 02:02:28.900]   It was almost as if they were just standing back
[02:02:28.900 --> 02:02:30.580]   and waiting for it, and then, bop,
[02:02:30.580 --> 02:02:32.060]   it just popped out in front of them.
[02:02:32.060 --> 02:02:36.100]   All the letters kind of reorganized and clicked into place.
[02:02:36.100 --> 02:02:39.260]   And then there was a subsequent study
[02:02:39.260 --> 02:02:41.060]   that did something different.
[02:02:41.060 --> 02:02:44.580]   It looked specifically at creative insight.
[02:02:45.540 --> 02:02:47.740]   And it was a lovely study,
[02:02:47.740 --> 02:02:48.860]   and they performed something called
[02:02:48.860 --> 02:02:50.740]   the numeric number reduction test,
[02:02:50.740 --> 02:02:52.020]   which is one of those tests
[02:02:52.020 --> 02:02:53.820]   that psychologists love to administer
[02:02:53.820 --> 02:02:56.340]   and participants hate to perform.
[02:02:56.340 --> 02:02:57.580]   And here's what happens.
[02:02:57.580 --> 02:02:59.860]   You're shown a whole string of numbers,
[02:02:59.860 --> 02:03:02.500]   and you are given a certain set of rules,
[02:03:02.500 --> 02:03:04.660]   and you have to work through those number problems
[02:03:04.660 --> 02:03:07.100]   and come out with a final end answer.
[02:03:07.100 --> 02:03:09.300]   And you're told that you're going to be judged simply
[02:03:09.300 --> 02:03:12.940]   on how many correct final end answers that you get.
[02:03:12.940 --> 02:03:15.580]   And you work through hundreds of these problems.
[02:03:15.580 --> 02:03:19.740]   What they don't tell you in the instructions, however,
[02:03:19.740 --> 02:03:22.380]   is that there is a hidden rule here
[02:03:22.380 --> 02:03:25.140]   embedded in that all of those sequences,
[02:03:25.140 --> 02:03:27.140]   all of the sequences are different that you have to solve,
[02:03:27.140 --> 02:03:30.940]   but there is one common rule that binds them all together,
[02:03:30.940 --> 02:03:33.100]   which is that the second part,
[02:03:33.100 --> 02:03:35.380]   sort of the second component of the solution,
[02:03:35.380 --> 02:03:36.500]   so you're working through,
[02:03:36.500 --> 02:03:38.580]   let's say it's a 10-digit string number,
[02:03:38.580 --> 02:03:40.740]   and you have to apply these rules to the first number,
[02:03:40.740 --> 02:03:42.140]   then carry it through to the second number,
[02:03:42.140 --> 02:03:44.060]   and then to the third number.
[02:03:44.060 --> 02:03:46.620]   The second partial number that you produce
[02:03:46.620 --> 02:03:48.780]   in this string of calculations
[02:03:48.780 --> 02:03:51.140]   to get to the final end answer,
[02:03:51.140 --> 02:03:55.060]   it turns out to be always the same end answer.
[02:03:55.060 --> 02:03:58.420]   So in other words, if you clue on to this hidden rule,
[02:03:58.420 --> 02:04:00.780]   all you have to do is work up to the first,
[02:04:00.780 --> 02:04:02.540]   let's say 10% of every problem.
[02:04:02.540 --> 02:04:04.220]   You can just shortcut the rest of it,
[02:04:04.220 --> 02:04:05.460]   and you just write down the number,
[02:04:05.460 --> 02:04:08.260]   'cause you are told that the only thing
[02:04:08.260 --> 02:04:10.340]   we're going to judge you on is the end answer.
[02:04:10.340 --> 02:04:11.860]   So they trained participants
[02:04:11.860 --> 02:04:15.540]   on these sort of numeric number reduction trials,
[02:04:15.540 --> 02:04:16.580]   and then they brought them back
[02:04:16.580 --> 02:04:18.820]   after 12 hours of being awake,
[02:04:18.820 --> 02:04:22.300]   and no one seemed to have that light bulb moment
[02:04:22.300 --> 02:04:25.500]   of the sort of, "Okay, I get it."
[02:04:25.500 --> 02:04:27.180]   But then they did the same thing.
[02:04:27.180 --> 02:04:28.980]   They trained them, but now they train them in the evening.
[02:04:28.980 --> 02:04:30.740]   They gave them a full eight hours of sleep.
[02:04:30.740 --> 02:04:32.580]   They came back the next morning,
[02:04:32.580 --> 02:04:36.180]   and there was a three-fold increase
[02:04:36.180 --> 02:04:38.980]   in creative insight problem-solving ability.
[02:04:38.980 --> 02:04:40.460]   In other words, people were coming back
[02:04:40.460 --> 02:04:44.740]   with that aha moment of, "You know, the gig is up.
[02:04:44.740 --> 02:04:45.580]   "I've got it.
[02:04:45.580 --> 02:04:47.180]   "I know what you guys are trying to do,
[02:04:47.180 --> 02:04:48.580]   "and I'm going to show you."
[02:04:48.580 --> 02:04:50.700]   Then they did something clever.
[02:04:50.700 --> 02:04:53.260]   They said, "Back to our question of motor skill learning.
[02:04:53.260 --> 02:04:56.340]   "Well, is that really sleep, or is it just circadian,
[02:04:56.340 --> 02:04:58.540]   "that it's just something about going through the night
[02:04:58.540 --> 02:05:02.220]   "that gives you this kind of doolally creative benefit?"
[02:05:02.220 --> 02:05:03.180]   So they took another group.
[02:05:03.180 --> 02:05:05.700]   They taught them the information in the evening,
[02:05:05.700 --> 02:05:06.940]   and they tested them the next morning,
[02:05:06.940 --> 02:05:07.980]   just like the sleep group,
[02:05:07.980 --> 02:05:09.300]   but they kept them up all night.
[02:05:09.300 --> 02:05:12.340]   So they went through nighttime nurse for that time period,
[02:05:12.340 --> 02:05:15.940]   and they showed no benefit in the problem-solving.
[02:05:15.940 --> 02:05:17.940]   - Yeah, my experience is that sleep deprivation
[02:05:17.940 --> 02:05:19.140]   leads to all sorts of ideas
[02:05:19.140 --> 02:05:23.140]   about how one is coming up with novel ideas and solutions,
[02:05:23.140 --> 02:05:26.580]   all of which completely suck after two good nights' sleep.
[02:05:26.580 --> 02:05:29.260]   (laughing)
[02:05:29.260 --> 02:05:30.740]   But most of the time,
[02:05:30.740 --> 02:05:35.740]   it seems that sleep deprivation, intoxication of any kind,
[02:05:35.980 --> 02:05:37.580]   it gives one the impression
[02:05:37.580 --> 02:05:39.420]   that you're coming up with novel solutions,
[02:05:39.420 --> 02:05:41.380]   but really they're just novel.
[02:05:41.380 --> 02:05:44.460]   - Yeah, that data is very clear that there was this misnomer
[02:05:44.460 --> 02:05:47.220]   that if I sort of go through the night
[02:05:47.220 --> 02:05:49.340]   and work sort of through into the morning,
[02:05:49.340 --> 02:05:53.060]   I'm just much more creative when I'm sleep-deprived,
[02:05:53.060 --> 02:05:56.620]   and it's been tested, and it's just, it's the opposite,
[02:05:56.620 --> 02:05:58.940]   quite the opposite, in fact.
[02:05:58.940 --> 02:06:01.100]   What I also find interesting, though,
[02:06:01.100 --> 02:06:04.300]   about this sleep and creativity log,
[02:06:04.300 --> 02:06:06.700]   it was always there in the literature
[02:06:06.700 --> 02:06:09.180]   that there are innumerable anecdotes
[02:06:09.180 --> 02:06:12.620]   of people having sleep-inspired insight.
[02:06:12.620 --> 02:06:15.860]   It's almost as though when you wake up the next morning,
[02:06:15.860 --> 02:06:20.580]   having had that revised set of web connections in your brain,
[02:06:20.580 --> 02:06:22.900]   you can divine solutions
[02:06:22.900 --> 02:06:26.340]   to previously impenetrable problems.
[02:06:26.340 --> 02:06:29.620]   And there's a great example, I think, Dimitri Mendeleev,
[02:06:29.620 --> 02:06:33.540]   who at the time was trying to answer
[02:06:33.540 --> 02:06:36.380]   one of the most epic questions in human history.
[02:06:36.380 --> 02:06:39.700]   How do all of the known elements in the universe
[02:06:39.700 --> 02:06:43.220]   fit together in some logical order?
[02:06:43.220 --> 02:06:45.540]   And he was failing, he just could not.
[02:06:45.540 --> 02:06:47.860]   And he was so obsessed with this problem,
[02:06:47.860 --> 02:06:50.020]   he created playing cards
[02:06:50.020 --> 02:06:52.740]   with all of the different elements of the universe
[02:06:52.740 --> 02:06:55.380]   and their atomic weights and their electron,
[02:06:55.380 --> 02:06:57.860]   and he would go on these long train rides
[02:06:57.860 --> 02:06:59.460]   and he would just shuffle the cards
[02:06:59.460 --> 02:07:01.500]   and he would deal the cards on the table
[02:07:01.500 --> 02:07:03.460]   'cause he was just desperate to try to see
[02:07:03.460 --> 02:07:04.700]   what the pattern was.
[02:07:04.700 --> 02:07:06.940]   He was shuffling and shuffling and shuffling.
[02:07:06.940 --> 02:07:08.660]   And then the story goes and it's written
[02:07:08.660 --> 02:07:13.660]   that one night he fell asleep and he dreamt
[02:07:13.660 --> 02:07:17.940]   and he could start to see all of the cards
[02:07:17.940 --> 02:07:20.420]   just dancing around in front of his eyes
[02:07:20.420 --> 02:07:24.820]   and then they snapped together in this logical grid
[02:07:24.820 --> 02:07:26.060]   based on the atomic weight
[02:07:26.060 --> 02:07:28.180]   and the different electron properties.
[02:07:28.180 --> 02:07:30.420]   And he wrote it down on the back of an envelope,
[02:07:30.420 --> 02:07:32.020]   which still exists to this date.
[02:07:32.020 --> 02:07:32.860]   - Really?
[02:07:32.860 --> 02:07:34.500]   - Yeah, and you can see it.
[02:07:34.500 --> 02:07:37.020]   And that was the initial basis
[02:07:37.020 --> 02:07:40.300]   for what we call the periodic table of elements.
[02:07:40.300 --> 02:07:41.140]   - Amazing.
[02:07:41.140 --> 02:07:43.420]   - And it revolutionized human history.
[02:07:43.420 --> 02:07:44.860]   And it's not just in science.
[02:07:44.860 --> 02:07:46.420]   I mean, there's great scientific,
[02:07:46.420 --> 02:07:47.780]   people have won Nobel prizes
[02:07:47.780 --> 02:07:50.580]   for understanding neural transmission, Otto Loewy.
[02:07:50.580 --> 02:07:53.020]   - Well, and maybe it's worth rattling off
[02:07:53.020 --> 02:07:56.300]   a few brief examples because they're so spectacular.
[02:07:56.300 --> 02:07:58.060]   Einstein was known for taking naps
[02:07:58.060 --> 02:07:59.100]   in the middle of the day,
[02:07:59.100 --> 02:08:00.420]   multiple times throughout the day
[02:08:00.420 --> 02:08:03.180]   in order to come up with novel solutions.
[02:08:03.180 --> 02:08:08.180]   I think the discovery of some of the organic--
[02:08:08.180 --> 02:08:10.260]   - The benzene ring?
[02:08:10.260 --> 02:08:13.740]   - The benzene ring came to, I'm forgetting.
[02:08:13.740 --> 02:08:14.580]   - August Kekulé.
[02:08:14.580 --> 02:08:16.300]   - In a dream, thank you.
[02:08:16.300 --> 02:08:20.820]   There are numerous examples
[02:08:20.820 --> 02:08:24.140]   of fundamental scientific discoveries
[02:08:25.380 --> 02:08:28.380]   that is creative insights
[02:08:28.380 --> 02:08:31.540]   that were anchored to real world experiments
[02:08:31.540 --> 02:08:34.620]   and theory, pure theory as well,
[02:08:34.620 --> 02:08:36.780]   that came to people in their dreams.
[02:08:36.780 --> 02:08:37.940]   So what's interesting though
[02:08:37.940 --> 02:08:40.340]   is that there seems to be some sort of hydraulic pressure
[02:08:40.340 --> 02:08:44.580]   created by the waking or within wakefulness attempt
[02:08:44.580 --> 02:08:45.980]   to like figure something out.
[02:08:45.980 --> 02:08:48.980]   So all of these people, to be very clear,
[02:08:48.980 --> 02:08:51.140]   didn't just sleep to come up with solutions.
[02:08:51.140 --> 02:08:53.420]   They put a lot of kind of hydraulic pressure
[02:08:53.420 --> 02:08:54.900]   feeding a lot of information,
[02:08:54.900 --> 02:08:56.900]   thinking about a problem
[02:08:56.900 --> 02:08:58.620]   in a structured or unstructured way,
[02:08:58.620 --> 02:09:01.380]   taking walks, focusing on their other demands of the day.
[02:09:01.380 --> 02:09:02.660]   But then when they went to sleep,
[02:09:02.660 --> 02:09:05.420]   clearly that information was still being worked with
[02:09:05.420 --> 02:09:06.740]   in important ways.
[02:09:06.740 --> 02:09:09.140]   And then you were going to mention some examples
[02:09:09.140 --> 02:09:10.940]   from the arts, I think.
[02:09:10.940 --> 02:09:12.420]   - Yeah, there's some great,
[02:09:12.420 --> 02:09:16.980]   I was born and raised in Liverpool, in England,
[02:09:16.980 --> 02:09:19.300]   and of course, famous for the Beatles
[02:09:19.300 --> 02:09:22.980]   and for Liverpool Football Club and Everton as well,
[02:09:22.980 --> 02:09:24.300]   but I'm a Liverpool supporter.
[02:09:24.300 --> 02:09:27.980]   However, Paul McCartney has gone on record very clearly
[02:09:27.980 --> 02:09:31.220]   to say that two songs that were probably
[02:09:31.220 --> 02:09:34.140]   some of the most successful songs,
[02:09:34.140 --> 02:09:36.140]   "Yesterday" and "Let It Be",
[02:09:36.140 --> 02:09:39.220]   both came to him by way of dream-inspired insight.
[02:09:39.220 --> 02:09:41.660]   There's a lovely description, I think, in his biography.
[02:09:41.660 --> 02:09:44.140]   He was filming, it was either "Help"
[02:09:44.140 --> 02:09:46.980]   or "A Hard Day's Night" down in London
[02:09:46.980 --> 02:09:48.300]   with the rest of the Beatles.
[02:09:48.300 --> 02:09:51.700]   And he was staying in a rental in Wimpole Street in London.
[02:09:51.700 --> 02:09:53.220]   And he was staying on the third floor.
[02:09:53.220 --> 02:09:54.980]   And in his bedroom, fortunately,
[02:09:54.980 --> 02:09:57.860]   there was a piano on the opposite side of the room.
[02:09:57.860 --> 02:10:00.740]   And he describes how he woke up one morning
[02:10:00.740 --> 02:10:05.700]   with this beautiful melody by way of,
[02:10:05.700 --> 02:10:08.220]   it was a string quartet that was playing it.
[02:10:08.220 --> 02:10:11.860]   And it was the melody for "Yesterday".
[02:10:11.860 --> 02:10:13.700]   And he went straight over to the piano
[02:10:13.700 --> 02:10:15.500]   and he started playing it.
[02:10:15.500 --> 02:10:17.780]   And he said, it was just so sumptuous.
[02:10:17.780 --> 02:10:21.420]   And he couldn't remember where he had heard it.
[02:10:21.420 --> 02:10:23.180]   And then after a while he remembered,
[02:10:23.180 --> 02:10:25.060]   I haven't heard it anywhere before.
[02:10:25.060 --> 02:10:27.740]   It came to me by way of sleep.
[02:10:27.740 --> 02:10:31.220]   Same thing with "Let It Be".
[02:10:31.220 --> 02:10:37.100]   Obviously, Mother Mary comes to me singing songs
[02:10:37.100 --> 02:10:39.580]   or singing words of wisdom, "Let It Be".
[02:10:39.580 --> 02:10:41.180]   And there's often been a suggestion
[02:10:41.180 --> 02:10:45.100]   that that has religious overtones in terms of Mother Mary.
[02:10:45.100 --> 02:10:46.300]   It actually is not.
[02:10:46.300 --> 02:10:49.820]   It's his mother, Mary McCartney.
[02:10:51.020 --> 02:10:52.820]   And he was having a hard time struggling
[02:10:52.820 --> 02:10:55.340]   with the fame of the Beatles at that moment.
[02:10:55.340 --> 02:10:58.220]   And one night he slept and his mother, Mary,
[02:10:58.220 --> 02:11:01.900]   came to him and just said, relax, it's going to be okay.
[02:11:01.900 --> 02:11:05.820]   Stay true to yourself, continue doing what you're doing.
[02:11:05.820 --> 02:11:07.100]   Just let it be.
[02:11:07.100 --> 02:11:08.940]   And he woke up and he wrote the song.
[02:11:08.940 --> 02:11:10.380]   - I love that story.
[02:11:10.380 --> 02:11:15.260]   And there's some actionable takeaways here that if I may,
[02:11:15.260 --> 02:11:18.140]   I just wanted to mention.
[02:11:20.180 --> 02:11:21.500]   A previous guest on this episode,
[02:11:21.500 --> 02:11:23.700]   in fact, he's been on the podcast twice,
[02:11:23.700 --> 02:11:25.900]   is the great Rick Rubin.
[02:11:25.900 --> 02:11:27.260]   - Oh, I've listened to those.
[02:11:27.260 --> 02:11:30.260]   - Yeah, one of the most legendary music producers
[02:11:30.260 --> 02:11:31.100]   of all time.
[02:11:31.100 --> 02:11:33.220]   And the second episode that we did with Rick,
[02:11:33.220 --> 02:11:36.180]   he gets heavily into some of his protocols
[02:11:36.180 --> 02:11:38.060]   for lack of a better way to describe them.
[02:11:38.060 --> 02:11:40.620]   And one of the things that Rick does
[02:11:40.620 --> 02:11:42.180]   is when he wakes up in the morning,
[02:11:42.180 --> 02:11:47.180]   he makes it a point to, he takes walks, he gets sunshine,
[02:11:47.180 --> 02:11:49.340]   he hydrates, he does all of those things.
[02:11:49.340 --> 02:11:51.860]   But to try and make the transition between sleep
[02:11:51.860 --> 02:11:54.340]   and wakefulness to be rather gradual,
[02:11:54.340 --> 02:11:58.620]   almost to allow some of the components of sleep
[02:11:58.620 --> 02:12:01.700]   to kind of bleed into the morning
[02:12:01.700 --> 02:12:04.300]   and then allow wakefulness to come about.
[02:12:04.300 --> 02:12:07.500]   And in his case, he's able to push some of the more
[02:12:07.500 --> 02:12:09.980]   linear processing and procedural things
[02:12:09.980 --> 02:12:11.940]   to later in the day.
[02:12:11.940 --> 02:12:13.900]   And I've spent a lot of time with Rick.
[02:12:13.900 --> 02:12:15.580]   I'm fortunate to be close friends with Rick.
[02:12:15.580 --> 02:12:18.620]   And I can tell you that he also spends a fair amount of time
[02:12:18.620 --> 02:12:21.540]   sitting or lying down typically very still
[02:12:21.540 --> 02:12:22.540]   with his eyes closed,
[02:12:22.540 --> 02:12:24.980]   just thinking or allowing thoughts to emerge
[02:12:24.980 --> 02:12:27.900]   as part of his creative process.
[02:12:27.900 --> 02:12:30.980]   Now, he's certainly not the only one to do this,
[02:12:30.980 --> 02:12:33.200]   but he's a notable example.
[02:12:33.200 --> 02:12:34.780]   But what's the takeaway here?
[02:12:34.780 --> 02:12:37.420]   Should everyone be lying with their eyes closed
[02:12:37.420 --> 02:12:38.420]   when they first wake up?
[02:12:38.420 --> 02:12:41.180]   Perhaps, but there's some potential do's,
[02:12:41.180 --> 02:12:43.900]   but I think there's a really strong don't.
[02:12:43.900 --> 02:12:47.100]   If one subscribes to the idea that during sleep
[02:12:47.100 --> 02:12:50.340]   there is substantial reorganization of neural circuitry,
[02:12:50.340 --> 02:12:54.160]   aka learning, but also expansion of creative opportunity,
[02:12:54.160 --> 02:12:56.220]   as you've clearly pointed out,
[02:12:56.220 --> 02:12:58.540]   and there are data to support that statement,
[02:12:58.540 --> 02:13:01.940]   then it stands to reason that upon waking,
[02:13:01.940 --> 02:13:05.620]   there's a key opportunity to capture some of that
[02:13:05.620 --> 02:13:10.860]   information that is now in your mind
[02:13:10.860 --> 02:13:12.180]   that was created the night before,
[02:13:12.180 --> 02:13:16.140]   but that if you immediately look at your phone,
[02:13:16.140 --> 02:13:19.220]   that you eclipse that process
[02:13:19.220 --> 02:13:21.660]   with sensory input from somebody else's ideas
[02:13:21.660 --> 02:13:22.900]   and what's going on in the world.
[02:13:22.900 --> 02:13:24.040]   And it's not to say that looking at your phone
[02:13:24.040 --> 02:13:26.320]   first thing in the morning is a cardinal sin
[02:13:26.320 --> 02:13:29.820]   or a violation of any kind of neural circuit requirement,
[02:13:29.820 --> 02:13:32.200]   but I, in an attempt to try and capture
[02:13:32.200 --> 02:13:33.720]   some of the learning and creativity
[02:13:33.720 --> 02:13:35.260]   that occurs during sleep,
[02:13:35.260 --> 02:13:38.220]   have tried for a while now to not look at my phone
[02:13:38.220 --> 02:13:40.140]   for at least the first 30 minutes after waking.
[02:13:40.140 --> 02:13:43.420]   It's very challenging to do for most everybody,
[02:13:43.420 --> 02:13:47.940]   but rather to let some of the ideas from sleep percolate up.
[02:13:47.940 --> 02:13:50.380]   And I will often go, you know, be, you know,
[02:13:50.380 --> 02:13:52.500]   making a morning cup of tea or something,
[02:13:52.500 --> 02:13:55.660]   and then go running to my office to write something down
[02:13:55.660 --> 02:13:56.700]   that suddenly springs to mind.
[02:13:56.700 --> 02:13:58.340]   And then I'll remember that this was something
[02:13:58.340 --> 02:13:59.900]   that came to me in a dream the night before,
[02:13:59.900 --> 02:14:01.820]   none of which is significant as the benzene ring
[02:14:01.820 --> 02:14:03.620]   or the periodic table or the kind of works
[02:14:03.620 --> 02:14:05.020]   that Rick has produced.
[02:14:05.020 --> 02:14:07.740]   But I think that we need to be cautious
[02:14:07.740 --> 02:14:12.740]   about not short-circuiting these creative insights
[02:14:13.220 --> 02:14:15.260]   that no doubt can come to us in sleep.
[02:14:15.260 --> 02:14:17.820]   - I think it's very well worth just,
[02:14:17.820 --> 02:14:19.420]   even for your own mental health,
[02:14:19.420 --> 02:14:21.460]   firstly, not to just wake up
[02:14:21.460 --> 02:14:24.420]   and start your reception of the world,
[02:14:24.420 --> 02:14:26.260]   but to do some, as we've mentioned,
[02:14:26.260 --> 02:14:29.220]   reflection on what you've just experienced
[02:14:29.220 --> 02:14:30.460]   by way of sleeping.
[02:14:30.460 --> 02:14:32.060]   And it doesn't necessarily have to be
[02:14:32.060 --> 02:14:34.280]   that you're trying to recall your dreams.
[02:14:34.280 --> 02:14:36.740]   Just sit with whatever your thoughts are.
[02:14:36.740 --> 02:14:40.660]   Think about the day ahead, think about the days prior,
[02:14:40.660 --> 02:14:42.060]   and there is some benefit.
[02:14:42.060 --> 02:14:46.460]   And the creative benefit there, you mentioned Einstein.
[02:14:46.460 --> 02:14:50.140]   Another one that is often mentioned to me is Edison,
[02:14:50.140 --> 02:14:51.740]   Thomas Edison, the inventor.
[02:14:51.740 --> 02:14:54.660]   And Edison was claimed to be a short sleeper.
[02:14:54.660 --> 02:14:57.620]   People will say, well, he was a brilliant inventor,
[02:14:57.620 --> 02:15:00.940]   but you said that he didn't sleep very much.
[02:15:00.940 --> 02:15:03.740]   It turns out that Edison was a habitual napper
[02:15:03.740 --> 02:15:04.580]   during the day.
[02:15:04.580 --> 02:15:07.180]   And I've got lots of pictures of him napping
[02:15:07.180 --> 02:15:11.620]   on his workbench in his studio, him napping in the garden.
[02:15:11.620 --> 02:15:12.460]   - Oh, I love it.
[02:15:12.460 --> 02:15:14.780]   Well, I took a 45-minute nap today.
[02:15:14.780 --> 02:15:16.340]   - Yeah, and it was, he--
[02:15:16.340 --> 02:15:20.200]   - And I'm no Edison, but I subscribe to his protocols.
[02:15:20.200 --> 02:15:24.820]   - But, you know, he understood the creative brilliance
[02:15:24.820 --> 02:15:28.140]   of sleep, to your point, about writing things down,
[02:15:28.140 --> 02:15:30.260]   and he used it ruthlessly as a tool.
[02:15:30.260 --> 02:15:31.180]   And here's what he would do.
[02:15:31.180 --> 02:15:32.300]   It's genius.
[02:15:32.300 --> 02:15:35.340]   He would take a pair of steel ball bearings
[02:15:35.340 --> 02:15:38.100]   in his right hand, and he would sit in his office
[02:15:38.100 --> 02:15:41.500]   on a reclining chair with a rest for his arm.
[02:15:41.500 --> 02:15:45.060]   And then he would put a pad of paper and a pen next to him.
[02:15:45.060 --> 02:15:47.960]   And then he would gradually start to relax off.
[02:15:47.960 --> 02:15:52.060]   But what he'd done was he used a metal saucepan
[02:15:52.060 --> 02:15:53.100]   and turned it upside down
[02:15:53.100 --> 02:15:55.300]   and placed it underneath the armrest.
[02:15:55.300 --> 02:15:57.820]   And as he was drifting off into that state,
[02:15:57.820 --> 02:15:59.500]   into that sort of liminal state,
[02:15:59.500 --> 02:16:02.140]   so he didn't go too far into sleep,
[02:16:02.140 --> 02:16:03.900]   what would happen is that his muscle tone
[02:16:03.900 --> 02:16:05.140]   would gradually relax.
[02:16:05.140 --> 02:16:07.260]   He would release the steel ball bearings.
[02:16:07.260 --> 02:16:09.660]   They would crash on the saucepan, wake him up,
[02:16:09.660 --> 02:16:12.740]   and he would start to write down all of the ideas
[02:16:12.740 --> 02:16:14.540]   that he was having from that liminal state.
[02:16:14.540 --> 02:16:16.100]   - Oh, you said saucepan.
[02:16:16.100 --> 02:16:16.940]   - Saucepan, sorry.
[02:16:16.940 --> 02:16:18.380]   - That's why, no, no, that's okay.
[02:16:18.380 --> 02:16:20.420]   But you're very-- - Bad accent.
[02:16:20.420 --> 02:16:23.060]   - So it made a clanging sound.
[02:16:23.060 --> 02:16:24.300]   - A metal saucepan underneath.
[02:16:24.300 --> 02:16:25.140]   - Got it, got it.
[02:16:25.140 --> 02:16:27.180]   - Or a water pail, whatever it was.
[02:16:27.180 --> 02:16:29.300]   And it would crash there, wake him up,
[02:16:29.300 --> 02:16:30.820]   and then he would write down these ideas.
[02:16:30.820 --> 02:16:31.660]   - So interesting.
[02:16:31.660 --> 02:16:34.440]   - And in fact, if you look at his house,
[02:16:34.440 --> 02:16:37.340]   which is preserved, historical, you can walk around,
[02:16:37.340 --> 02:16:41.700]   and he had nap cots installed in his house,
[02:16:41.700 --> 02:16:43.420]   so he could go into different rooms
[02:16:43.420 --> 02:16:45.540]   and take naps in these little cots.
[02:16:45.540 --> 02:16:46.780]   - Listen, I-- - For his genius,
[02:16:46.780 --> 02:16:48.620]   but it's brilliant, isn't it?
[02:16:48.620 --> 02:16:49.460]   - It is brilliant.
[02:16:49.460 --> 02:16:50.380]   Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt,
[02:16:50.380 --> 02:16:51.940]   but it was out of enthusiasm.
[02:16:51.940 --> 02:16:56.020]   I mean, I don't want to give too much detailed information
[02:16:56.020 --> 02:16:57.700]   about Rick's working environment,
[02:16:57.700 --> 02:16:59.300]   but yeah, let's just say there are a lot of places
[02:16:59.300 --> 02:17:04.100]   to lie down and access these states of mind.
[02:17:04.100 --> 02:17:07.140]   And it looks like somebody just lying there
[02:17:07.140 --> 02:17:07.980]   with their eyes closed,
[02:17:07.980 --> 02:17:10.760]   but there's an extremely active mind in there.
[02:17:10.760 --> 02:17:14.980]   Obviously, look at the productive output of Rick's career
[02:17:14.980 --> 02:17:17.420]   is truly something to behold.
[02:17:17.420 --> 02:17:20.480]   Behold in capital, bold, underlined, highlighted letters.
[02:17:20.480 --> 02:17:26.180]   But it's so clear to me, based on all the examples you gave,
[02:17:26.180 --> 02:17:28.100]   the ones that we're kind of batting back and forth now,
[02:17:28.100 --> 02:17:29.460]   and I think there's a book,
[02:17:29.460 --> 02:17:32.980]   the title is something like Winston Churchill's Nap
[02:17:32.980 --> 02:17:34.140]   or something like that.
[02:17:34.140 --> 02:17:35.180]   Then my dad is always talking,
[02:17:35.180 --> 02:17:36.420]   my dad's a theoretical physicist,
[02:17:36.420 --> 02:17:39.180]   always talks about napping is so key
[02:17:39.180 --> 02:17:42.760]   to one's ability to come up with novel solutions.
[02:17:42.760 --> 02:17:46.300]   I guess that napping frequently throughout the day
[02:17:46.300 --> 02:17:48.420]   perhaps violates some of the tenets
[02:17:48.420 --> 02:17:52.640]   that you described in the episode
[02:17:52.640 --> 02:17:55.720]   on napping and caffeine, episode three.
[02:17:55.720 --> 02:17:58.140]   - I think you agree 'cause we put in guardrails
[02:17:58.140 --> 02:17:59.700]   and we put in the protocols to say,
[02:17:59.700 --> 02:18:02.340]   okay, naps under certain circumstances
[02:18:02.340 --> 02:18:03.540]   are no bad thing at all.
[02:18:03.540 --> 02:18:04.380]   And if you're going to do it,
[02:18:04.380 --> 02:18:06.460]   here are the suggested guidelines
[02:18:06.460 --> 02:18:10.220]   as to exactly how you optimize naps with a protocol.
[02:18:10.220 --> 02:18:13.740]   But it is, I think it's very worthwhile
[02:18:13.740 --> 02:18:17.720]   to just appreciate exactly how complex sleep is
[02:18:17.720 --> 02:18:21.300]   in terms of what it's doing for information processing.
[02:18:21.300 --> 02:18:22.140]   And if you were to ask me,
[02:18:22.140 --> 02:18:25.500]   look, what's the take home of this final section?
[02:18:25.500 --> 02:18:30.100]   I think it's, no one has ever told you,
[02:18:30.100 --> 02:18:32.960]   Andrew, you really need to stay awake on a problem.
[02:18:34.280 --> 02:18:36.060]   They've told you that you should sleep.
[02:18:36.060 --> 02:18:36.980]   - No, many times.
[02:18:36.980 --> 02:18:37.820]   - On a problem.
[02:18:37.820 --> 02:18:38.640]   - Go to sleep.
[02:18:38.640 --> 02:18:39.700]   - Yeah, sleep on a problem.
[02:18:39.700 --> 02:18:42.040]   And what's interesting is that in every language
[02:18:42.040 --> 02:18:44.180]   that I've inquired about today,
[02:18:44.180 --> 02:18:47.840]   from English to Swahili,
[02:18:47.840 --> 02:18:49.700]   that phrase, sleeping on a problem,
[02:18:49.700 --> 02:18:52.360]   or something like it, very much exists.
[02:18:52.360 --> 02:18:55.120]   I think the Spanish someone was telling me is,
[02:18:55.120 --> 02:18:58.000]   translated is, you have a conversation with your pillow,
[02:18:58.000 --> 02:18:59.540]   which I thought was lovely.
[02:18:59.540 --> 02:19:03.140]   What I also was struck by a fellow
[02:19:03.140 --> 02:19:06.900]   who was French said, you in England,
[02:19:06.900 --> 02:19:09.900]   you say you sleep on a problem.
[02:19:09.900 --> 02:19:12.020]   Well, the French translation is much closer to you
[02:19:12.020 --> 02:19:13.740]   sleep with a problem.
[02:19:13.740 --> 02:19:18.240]   And I thought that says so much about the romantic difference
[02:19:18.240 --> 02:19:21.380]   between the beautiful French and the English.
[02:19:21.380 --> 02:19:24.580]   You sleep on a problem versus you sleep with a problem.
[02:19:24.580 --> 02:19:25.420]   - Yes, I agree.
[02:19:25.420 --> 02:19:28.660]   I think not only does it have more romantic notions,
[02:19:28.660 --> 02:19:33.660]   but I like it because there's a symbiotic aspect
[02:19:33.660 --> 02:19:35.860]   to sleeping with the problem.
[02:19:35.860 --> 02:19:38.660]   There's kind of a meshing with the challenge
[02:19:38.660 --> 02:19:43.020]   in a way that isn't as combative.
[02:19:43.020 --> 02:19:44.420]   Like this thing that's weighing on you,
[02:19:44.420 --> 02:19:46.100]   you go to sleep with and you're supposed to wake up
[02:19:46.100 --> 02:19:49.180]   and feel like you've solved it, like Eureka, right?
[02:19:49.180 --> 02:19:51.460]   - Push down on it rather than it's a collaboration
[02:19:51.460 --> 02:19:54.660]   with sleep rather than a demand from it.
[02:19:54.660 --> 02:19:56.540]   But I also think it's,
[02:19:56.540 --> 02:19:59.780]   I make that notion about language translation
[02:19:59.780 --> 02:20:01.420]   and maybe a slight joke,
[02:20:01.420 --> 02:20:04.380]   but what it also tells me is this,
[02:20:04.380 --> 02:20:09.260]   that that phenomenon of sleep dependent creativity
[02:20:09.260 --> 02:20:11.220]   transcends cultural boundaries.
[02:20:11.220 --> 02:20:13.380]   It is common across the globe.
[02:20:13.380 --> 02:20:15.380]   It's a universal phenomenon.
[02:20:15.380 --> 02:20:16.300]   Why?
[02:20:16.300 --> 02:20:19.020]   Well, because sleep is a universal phenomenon,
[02:20:19.020 --> 02:20:20.860]   not just even in humans,
[02:20:20.860 --> 02:20:22.360]   but in almost every species
[02:20:22.360 --> 02:20:24.100]   that we've studied carefully today.
[02:20:25.620 --> 02:20:30.220]   - As you described the French notion
[02:20:30.220 --> 02:20:31.340]   of sleeping with a problem,
[02:20:31.340 --> 02:20:33.500]   I think one of the images that comes to mind
[02:20:33.500 --> 02:20:35.660]   is that perhaps the idea is
[02:20:35.660 --> 02:20:37.660]   if you're going to sleep with a problem
[02:20:37.660 --> 02:20:39.900]   that you should be the big spoon
[02:20:39.900 --> 02:20:41.340]   and they should be the little spoon,
[02:20:41.340 --> 02:20:44.340]   as opposed to the problem being the big spoon
[02:20:44.340 --> 02:20:46.140]   and you're kind of wrapped in the problem.
[02:20:46.140 --> 02:20:48.140]   Maybe the problem needs to mesh with you,
[02:20:48.140 --> 02:20:51.540]   but maybe I'm taking this imagery a little too far.
[02:20:51.540 --> 02:20:53.540]   Before we close out this discussion
[02:20:53.540 --> 02:20:55.580]   about sleep and creativity,
[02:20:55.580 --> 02:20:59.140]   I can't help but bring up a set of questions
[02:20:59.140 --> 02:21:03.820]   around a different non-sleep protocol
[02:21:03.820 --> 02:21:07.180]   that in many ways seems to mimic sleep
[02:21:07.180 --> 02:21:10.260]   and that for some individuals throughout history,
[02:21:10.260 --> 02:21:12.760]   in particular, the great physicist Richard Feynman,
[02:21:12.760 --> 02:21:15.740]   another habitual napper.
[02:21:15.740 --> 02:21:17.920]   - Yeah, and an absolute idol of mine.
[02:21:17.920 --> 02:21:22.860]   - Wrote about and spoke about his fondness
[02:21:22.860 --> 02:21:25.660]   for these flotation tanks
[02:21:25.660 --> 02:21:28.980]   that contain a temperature of water
[02:21:28.980 --> 02:21:30.820]   that is fairly neutral.
[02:21:30.820 --> 02:21:32.940]   So one doesn't recognize the difference
[02:21:32.940 --> 02:21:35.660]   between body temperature and the surrounding water.
[02:21:35.660 --> 02:21:39.620]   And there's a certain amount of salt salinity in the water
[02:21:39.620 --> 02:21:43.980]   that allows one to float at a kind of a depth
[02:21:43.980 --> 02:21:46.260]   within the water that one loses their sense
[02:21:46.260 --> 02:21:48.340]   of proprioceptive awareness,
[02:21:48.340 --> 02:21:51.300]   as you described earlier in the series,
[02:21:51.300 --> 02:21:53.300]   a key component of falling asleep.
[02:21:53.300 --> 02:21:56.440]   And he talked about how under those conditions
[02:21:56.440 --> 02:21:57.700]   in the flotation tank,
[02:21:57.700 --> 02:22:00.340]   there was a kind of an untethering
[02:22:00.340 --> 02:22:02.960]   of one's notions of space and time
[02:22:02.960 --> 02:22:04.140]   that were very sleep-like
[02:22:04.140 --> 02:22:09.140]   and that that was one of his go-tos for creative solutions.
[02:22:09.140 --> 02:22:11.700]   People talked about walks
[02:22:11.700 --> 02:22:15.480]   as a go-to for creative solutions.
[02:22:15.480 --> 02:22:16.460]   In the shower,
[02:22:16.460 --> 02:22:18.980]   people seem to come up with creative solutions.
[02:22:18.980 --> 02:22:22.960]   States of mind where they're in activities
[02:22:22.960 --> 02:22:27.420]   where it's only somewhat goal-directed,
[02:22:27.420 --> 02:22:30.180]   but basically the idea is to just lose track
[02:22:30.180 --> 02:22:34.180]   of one's body positioning and let the mind go, so to speak.
[02:22:34.180 --> 02:22:35.020]   And for that matter,
[02:22:35.020 --> 02:22:38.900]   psychedelics have on occasion been attributed
[02:22:38.900 --> 02:22:42.180]   as at least one of the sources of creative solutions.
[02:22:42.180 --> 02:22:43.560]   I raised these ideas,
[02:22:43.560 --> 02:22:44.980]   understanding that each one of those
[02:22:44.980 --> 02:22:47.180]   could be a podcast into itself.
[02:22:47.180 --> 02:22:50.520]   But it seems to me that sleep,
[02:22:50.520 --> 02:22:54.100]   and in particular dream sleep,
[02:22:54.100 --> 02:22:59.100]   is nature's way of creating these states of untethering,
[02:22:59.100 --> 02:23:04.580]   our rigid, linear understanding of what relates to what.
[02:23:04.580 --> 02:23:08.300]   And it provides this near magical mixing
[02:23:08.300 --> 02:23:10.300]   of things learned the day before.
[02:23:10.300 --> 02:23:12.860]   And that's the essence of creativity.
[02:23:12.860 --> 02:23:15.000]   And humans have been trying to tap into the creative process
[02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:16.740]   through all these other portals for a long time
[02:23:16.740 --> 02:23:19.580]   with expensive technologies.
[02:23:19.580 --> 02:23:21.920]   But it's becoming very clear to me
[02:23:21.920 --> 02:23:24.580]   that the technology already exists
[02:23:24.580 --> 02:23:26.900]   and that it costs absolutely nothing.
[02:23:26.900 --> 02:23:29.000]   And that it has tremendous health benefits
[02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:33.760]   in addition to its benefits for creativity.
[02:23:33.760 --> 02:23:38.760]   And that technology is this brilliant technology of sleep.
[02:23:38.760 --> 02:23:39.980]   - Yeah, and dreaming.
[02:23:39.980 --> 02:23:42.380]   It's a stunning state.
[02:23:42.380 --> 02:23:45.700]   - Matt, thank you so much for today's discussion
[02:23:45.700 --> 02:23:50.500]   about sleep, memory, learning, and creativity.
[02:23:50.500 --> 02:23:55.500]   We are now four episodes into this series on sleep.
[02:23:55.500 --> 02:23:59.420]   First episode, we discussed,
[02:23:59.420 --> 02:24:03.220]   rather, you taught us about sleep
[02:24:03.220 --> 02:24:04.720]   and the biology of sleep,
[02:24:04.720 --> 02:24:07.620]   as well as some actionable takeaways.
[02:24:07.620 --> 02:24:09.380]   So actually some, I would say,
[02:24:09.380 --> 02:24:14.380]   some important guidelines for getting one's sleep correct.
[02:24:14.840 --> 02:24:17.240]   And then in this second episode,
[02:24:17.240 --> 02:24:19.600]   you went much further into protocols,
[02:24:19.600 --> 02:24:22.440]   both basic and advanced for getting one's sleep right,
[02:24:22.440 --> 02:24:24.560]   maybe even optimized.
[02:24:24.560 --> 02:24:29.440]   And the third episode, you taught us about naps and caffeine.
[02:24:29.440 --> 02:24:33.280]   And today you've taken us on a beautiful exploration
[02:24:33.280 --> 02:24:36.680]   of the relationship between sleep and learning.
[02:24:36.680 --> 02:24:39.220]   What's more interesting than neuroplasticity and learning?
[02:24:39.220 --> 02:24:42.160]   I mean, after all, you know,
[02:24:42.160 --> 02:24:44.400]   humans are unique in our ability to learn
[02:24:44.400 --> 02:24:46.400]   so many things throughout the lifespan.
[02:24:46.400 --> 02:24:48.080]   It's one of the things that distinguishes us
[02:24:48.080 --> 02:24:49.400]   from the other species on the planet,
[02:24:49.400 --> 02:24:52.640]   the very, very long window,
[02:24:52.640 --> 02:24:55.640]   perhaps lifelong window for the opportunity to learn.
[02:24:55.640 --> 02:24:59.360]   And of course, creativity and novel solutions
[02:24:59.360 --> 02:25:00.720]   to challenging problems in the world,
[02:25:00.720 --> 02:25:05.080]   but also great works of art and music, et cetera.
[02:25:05.080 --> 02:25:06.720]   I think we can fairly say,
[02:25:06.720 --> 02:25:07.900]   based on what you've taught us today,
[02:25:07.900 --> 02:25:10.960]   that sleep has been not only the bedrock
[02:25:10.960 --> 02:25:13.080]   of mental health, physical health and performance
[02:25:13.080 --> 02:25:14.480]   since the beginning of time and still now,
[02:25:14.480 --> 02:25:17.720]   but also has been one of the fundamental drivers
[02:25:17.720 --> 02:25:19.960]   of human evolution because of all the creative insights
[02:25:19.960 --> 02:25:21.280]   that have occurred and all the learning
[02:25:21.280 --> 02:25:25.200]   that's occurred in sleep that's then been transformed
[02:25:25.200 --> 02:25:26.880]   into real world technologies.
[02:25:26.880 --> 02:25:30.800]   Indeed, it's much of the way that we have the blessing
[02:25:30.800 --> 02:25:32.560]   of being right here, right now.
[02:25:32.560 --> 02:25:34.100]   - If that's the flag that you're raising,
[02:25:34.100 --> 02:25:38.200]   I will salute it five ways till Tuesday very much, yes.
[02:25:38.200 --> 02:25:41.120]   - Well, I'll salute that flag right with you
[02:25:41.120 --> 02:25:44.580]   and also point to the exciting fact
[02:25:44.580 --> 02:25:48.320]   that the next episode, episode five in this series,
[02:25:48.320 --> 02:25:52.480]   you're going to teach us about the really tight relationship
[02:25:52.480 --> 02:25:57.400]   between sleep and emotional processing and emotionality.
[02:25:57.400 --> 02:26:00.600]   And I can't think of a more interesting topic to get into,
[02:26:00.600 --> 02:26:02.720]   especially at this point in the series.
[02:26:02.720 --> 02:26:05.080]   And I look forward to that discussion
[02:26:05.080 --> 02:26:08.040]   with emotional enthusiasm.
[02:26:08.040 --> 02:26:08.880]   I can't wait.
[02:26:08.880 --> 02:26:11.880]   If folks are interested in trying to modulate
[02:26:11.880 --> 02:26:14.960]   their mental health, I think that next discussion
[02:26:14.960 --> 02:26:17.160]   should be very helpful with regard to sleep.
[02:26:17.160 --> 02:26:18.760]   I hope so at least.
[02:26:18.760 --> 02:26:20.600]   - Thank you for joining me for today's episode

[02:26:59.040 --> 02:27:00.960]   I do read all the comments.
[02:27:00.960 --> 02:27:02.960]   On many episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:27:02.960 --> 02:27:04.440]   we discuss supplements.
[02:27:04.440 --> 02:27:06.580]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[02:27:06.580 --> 02:27:08.620]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[02:27:08.620 --> 02:27:10.000]   for things like improving sleep,
[02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:12.000]   for hormone support, and for focus.
[02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:13.120]   To learn more about the supplements
[02:27:13.120 --> 02:27:14.760]   discussed on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:27:14.760 --> 02:27:17.320]   go to livemomentous, spelled O-U-S.
[02:27:17.320 --> 02:27:20.180]   That's livemomentous.com/huberman.
[02:27:20.180 --> 02:27:22.440]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[02:27:22.440 --> 02:27:25.160]   I'm Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[02:27:25.160 --> 02:27:28.640]   So that's Instagram, X, LinkedIn, Facebook, and threads.
[02:27:28.640 --> 02:27:30.160]   And on all those platforms,
[02:27:30.160 --> 02:27:32.460]   I discuss science and science-related tools,
[02:27:32.460 --> 02:27:33.960]   some of which overlaps with the content
[02:27:33.960 --> 02:27:35.400]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:27:35.400 --> 02:27:37.240]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[02:27:37.240 --> 02:27:38.760]   covered on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[02:27:38.760 --> 02:27:42.040]   So again, it's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[02:27:42.040 --> 02:27:43.200]   If you haven't already subscribed
[02:27:43.200 --> 02:27:44.960]   to our Neural Network Newsletter,
[02:27:44.960 --> 02:27:47.840]   our Neural Network Newsletter is a zero-cost newsletter
[02:27:47.840 --> 02:27:50.680]   that provides podcast summaries as well as protocols
[02:27:50.680 --> 02:27:53.160]   in the form of brief one-to-three-page PDFs
[02:27:53.160 --> 02:27:55.800]   that cover everything from neuroplasticity and learning
[02:27:55.800 --> 02:27:57.860]   to sleep to deliberate cold exposure
[02:27:57.860 --> 02:27:59.280]   and deliberate heat exposure.
[02:27:59.280 --> 02:28:02.320]   We have a foundational fitness protocol and much more,
[02:28:02.320 --> 02:28:04.320]   all of which, again, is completely zero cost.
[02:28:04.320 --> 02:28:06.400]   You simply go to HubermanLab.com,
[02:28:06.400 --> 02:28:08.600]   go to the Menu tab, scroll down to Newsletter,
[02:28:08.600 --> 02:28:11.040]   and by supplying your email, you can subscribe.
[02:28:11.040 --> 02:28:13.220]   I want to point out that we do not share your email
[02:28:13.220 --> 02:28:14.160]   with anybody.
[02:28:14.160 --> 02:28:15.500]   Thank you once again for joining me
[02:28:15.500 --> 02:28:17.640]   for today's discussion all about sleep
[02:28:17.640 --> 02:28:19.240]   with Dr. Matthew Walker.
[02:28:19.240 --> 02:28:21.280]   And last but certainly not least,
[02:28:21.280 --> 02:28:23.240]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:28:23.240 --> 02:28:25.820]   (upbeat music)
[02:28:25.820 --> 02:28:28.400]   (upbeat music)
