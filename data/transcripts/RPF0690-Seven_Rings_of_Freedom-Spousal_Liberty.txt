It wasn't necessary, but every other piece of clothing for our children was free. The shoes that they wore, free. Now, we have not been able to continue that since leaving the United States simply because where we live now, the free market is not as abundant as it was back there. Thankfully, we have tremendous other cost savings, and so now we spend money on clothes like normal people. But when we're in the United States, it was tremendous.

[01:01:00.780 --> 01:01:09.020]   know a lot and this is especially with a lot of moms it's why one of the reasons why many moms get involved in.

And so because of those fears, I think people often suppress the desire and they often suppress the conversation about it. So if I can do nothing other than potentially stimulate a conversation in your marriage about what you and your spouse would really like and how you would really like to live, I'm happy with that. But you've got to be honest.
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:26.200]  --
[01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:35.900]   child. I,
[01:20:34.500 --> 01:20:34.500]   I, my husband, I feel far more loving towards my wife knowing that she's been willing to do that for me and I think it makes our relationship far deeper than if she were competing with me and trying to say, well, I'm going to earn more than you are and we're going to have the separate things. If I didn't feel like my wife was fully invested in our place as a family, I'd feel like I was competing with her boss, her career, and that would make me feel less loving towards her and would make me feel less loving towards her.
[01:21:30.940 --> 01:21:30.940]  obed to make more money. She's just not producing enough. Men didn't acknowledge the contributions of their wife in the household and they wanted their wife to produce more. Often that cultural sense, that fact that many women, many wives don't see a way to contribute to their household or to their marriages unless they're earning an income. Often they're just short-sighted. They haven't had it modeled. Dad and mom both went to work every day and so the way that you contribute is you go to work every day.
[01:21:30.940 --> 01:21:59.740]  , this is a different experience. But if you want something different, be honest and talk about it. It sounds dumb, it just sounds simple, but that's the key. I think starting with being honest and talking about it. In addition, I hope I've given you a few ideas to see how if you're a woman who wants to be a stay-at-home wife, you've got an opportunity to really contribute to your household and you've got a really important job.

[01:23:56.780 --> 01:23:56.780]   and at work I can multitask and I can hire things done. It's quality of time at work that makes a difference, but it's quantity of time at home that makes a difference. But because many of us haven't had much of an example of what a pleasant home environment was like, of what it was like to have a place where everyone wanted to be and everyone wanted to be together because relationships were fractured and stress and tension and fights were all around the place. We didn't see that, but that doesn't have to be you. If you're a woman

[01:25:00.900 --> 01:25:07.300]   Now, if you talk about it, you side, you know what, in our family, we would like to have a stay at home parent.
[01:25:07.300 --> 01:25:09.500]   We would like mom or dad to stay at home.
[01:25:09.500 --> 01:25:11.100]   If you're going to, how are we going to do it?
[01:25:11.100 --> 01:25:15.000]   Well, my answer is if you're going to do it, just decide and do it.
[01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:24.440]   I'm convinced that this is far more of a personal ideological decision based upon something that you see and that you want.

[01:26:25.340 --> 01:26:25.340]   You may not be able to afford it where you are right now.
[01:26:25.340 --> 01:26:25.340]   You may not be able to afford it where you are right now.
[01:26:25.340 --> 01:26:25.340]   You may not be able to afford it where you are right now.
[01:26:25.340 --> 01:26:25.340]   You may not be able to afford it where you are right now.
[01:26:25.340 --> 01:26:25.340]   You may not be able to afford it where you are right now.
[01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:55.360]   I would do it because I'm ideologically committed.
[01:26:55.360 --> 01:26:55.360]   It's a presupposition.
[01:26:55.360 --> 01:26:55.360]   It's a pre-commitment to the money.
[01:26:55.360 --> 01:26:55.360]   Now you may not be there obviously so what you need to do is look at the numbers and think about what would I be willing to do to make this happen if you see it as important you will figure out a way to do it now only a few people though are going to be in a situation where it would be a really big financial cost most couples
[01:26:55.360 --> 01:26:55.360]   Most couples
[01:26:55.360 --> 01:26:55.360]   Most couples
[01:26:55.360 --> 01:26:55.360]   Most couples
[01:26:55.400 --> 01:27:25.380]   aren't making four hundred thousand dollars a year each of them most couples have at least one income in a house that's far more modest and when you calculate the cost of working as I've talked about in separate shows and you calculate the opportunities for more financial efficiency through this type of lifestyle I think you have more opportunities if you want it you can figure out a way to do it remember that not working in a job doesn't mean that you have to be not working in a job doesn't mean that you have to be not working in a job doesn't mean that you have to be not working in a job doesn't mean that you have to be
[01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:55.400]   It's kind of interesting I for a long time in the financial independence or the retirement space the fire movement I have stated the position publicly that I'm not a fan of the fire movement because to me it's just too much of a focus on unproductivity and kind of indolence and laziness this idea that while work I was working now I'm just going to sit back and engage in doing nothing and I don't see the point I think you should be productive for health and for
[01:27:55.400 --> 01:27:55.400]   I don't see the point I think you should be productive for health and for health and for health
[01:27:55.440 --> 01:28:25.420]  ,
[01:28:25.420 --> 01:28:25.420]   and for impact and for meaning in life should be productive so everyone has many people have said Joshua you're wrong I'm pursuing financial independence because but I'm not going to be unproductive I've got all these things I want to do but ironically when I talk about the value of having a stay-at-home wife when I talk about that people often just assume it's a place of unproductivity and they can't imagine how that's a better thing for her and how she can still be productive so don't do that you know if you're gonna look at ways that you can be productive
[01:28:25.420 --> 01:28:25.420]   you know if you're gonna look at ways that you can be productive so don't do that you know if you're gonna look at ways that you can be productive
[01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:55.440]   and productivity is not exclusively

[01:32:22.080 --> 01:32:22.080]   So,
[01:32:23.640 --> 01:32:52.100]   You have the society where the people who don't benefit are the dad and the mom and the children. They don't benefit really in any way, except this kind of ethereal, mystical sense of independence and financial independence and you go grow and be an independent woman and etc. Feel free to take that if you want it. I don't see it. So I've often wondered, is this whole thing just some giant conspiracy? Now, I don't actually believe it's giant conspiracy.
[01:32:52.120 --> 01:33:22.120]  Ğ¾Ğ±Ñ‰ing conspiracy, but it would not surprise me in an instant if you told me it was and you presented some kind of compelling proof. Either way, you can look at the results of it and say, this lifestyle really stinks. It's no fun. And yet, you don't have to live it. One of the most impactful books I've read in the last few years was Anthony Esalen's book, Out of the Ashes. If you haven't read it, I commend it to you. But in this first chapter, he talks about the wrongness of the world.

Read Out of the Ashes. And one of the things that he says on page 10 of chapter one called the rubble. He says, we are incompetent in the ordinary things of life. We're incompetent in the ordinary things of life.
