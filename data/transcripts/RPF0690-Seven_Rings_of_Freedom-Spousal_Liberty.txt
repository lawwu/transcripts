[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.600]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.120]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.580]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less. Today we continue our 7 Rings
[00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:48.720]   of Freedom series. This series is intended for me to share with you some ideas that I
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:55.440]   believe will help you to live a freer life. After all, one of the major reasons why people
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.920]   are pursuing financial independence is to experience more personal freedom. And I believe
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.800]   that that is an excellent way to achieve more personal freedom. We will talk about that
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.440]   as this 7th Ring, true financial independence, the ability to live off of the income from
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:16.800]   your investments, without question, brings you more freedom and more independence. However,
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.560]   I'm convinced there are a number of things that you can do prior to financial independence
[00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:28.760]   that will help you to enjoy much more of that freedom and independence. Some of these things
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.780]   are fairly well talked about. We'll talk about living free of debt. We'll talk about entrepreneurship.
[00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.640]   But some of these things are, in my opinion, under-discussed. For example, today's topic
[00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:47.720]   about spousal liberty, family liberty. I'm sharing this series from personal experience.
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:54.080]   All of these things are things that I have done and I didn't realize how good my decisions
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.660]   would have been until I worked my way through them. And I've come to the point where, although
[00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:05.240]   I'm not yet financially independent, working on it, but not yet there, I already live a
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.400]   freer lifestyle than anybody that I know. And I live as free of a lifestyle as I can
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.840]   imagine, and in some cases, freer than I can imagine people who are truly, you know, totally
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.760]   financially independent. More opportunities, more interest, etc. Now, I'm looking forward
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.180]   to financial independence, but these are some things that I have done that have really been
[00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:33.320]   helpful to me. And so today, I'm going to talk to you about the value of having a stay
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:41.160]   at home wife. Both the financial value and the way that that has impacted my life positively
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:47.280]   for tremendous personal freedom. I'm going to try to sell you on the idea. For those
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.960]   of you who are interested, some people don't need any selling. This is just absolutely
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.520]   the way that we're going to structure our family. Some people, they're like, "Absolutely
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.080]   not. I'm never going to do that." Okay, well, tune out here. But for those of you who are
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.200]   in the middle, who've thought about this, who've considered it, I'm going to share some
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:09.120]   personal experiences as to why I believe that for a couple to make this decision is one
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:16.380]   of the most profoundly impactful and freeing decisions. Now, I didn't know what order to
[00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.240]   put these in, so I just picked my own personal order. Because we're going to talk about things
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:26.360]   like entrepreneurship down the road, which is also a very freeing decision. But this
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:35.720]   is one of the things that has improved my life in innumerable ways. What I have found
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:43.860]   is that having a wife who does not have a paid job outside of the house has been one
[00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:52.120]   of the most freeing and positive and profitable, financially profitable lifestyle decisions
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:04:01.640]   that we could have made. And it's been that way for me, and it's been that way for her.
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.960]   For both of us, it has tremendously improved our lives. Now, I'll share with you a little
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:12.320]   bit of the backstory. This isn't something that was necessarily a big deal to me when
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:17.240]   I was younger, before the time I was planning to get married. Didn't really think much about
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:23.520]   it, really at all. I was raised in a home where my mom was always home when I was younger.
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:29.400]   And then, I guess about when I was in my 10, 11, 12 years old, when I was in seventh grade,
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.240]   my mom took a job at a local private school so that our family could afford the tuition
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.840]   payments there. And so she worked at that job at the private school for a number of
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.000]   years, all the years that I was through high school. And then after we all graduated from
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.800]   high school, then she left that job and she went back home to become a stay-at-home wife
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.680]   and mother again. So, obviously, being raised in that kind of environment, I just intuited
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.520]   that lifestyle naturally. That's different than a lot of people. But I didn't think a
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.960]   lot about it. I didn't pay much attention to it. When my wife and I first married, we
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.180]   didn't have these long, drawn-out conversations of, "This is exactly what we're going to do."
[00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:08.840]   But we both had a pretty obvious and clear plan that when we had children, that she would
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.160]   be a stay-at-home mom. That was important to us for the health and well-being of our
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.480]   children. But when we first married, my wife had a job. She had the job that she had for
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:22.760]   years and I was working, had a business. She had a job. And so we continued to have those
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:27.880]   jobs for the first year of our marriage. And then we conceived our first baby. And sometime
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:34.400]   before the birth, I forget exactly the timeline, she submitted her resignation and she quit
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.960]   her job to be home to prepare for the birth of our first child.
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:50.840]   And up until that time, I did not realize how annoying it was to have two full-time
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:57.040]   jobs in the family. Now, in many ways, we had a better, freer situation than a lot of
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:04.080]   people because we lived fairly light. We were fairly young. We had minimal obligations.
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.720]   When I, prior to marriage, I withdrew from all the previous things, all the boards that
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.200]   I had been on, all the community organizations I'd volunteered with. I just wanted all that
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:16.920]   stuff out of my life when I was entering into a family life. And so we had a fairly simple
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:21.880]   life. We lived in a small apartment. It made things fairly easy and simple for us. But
[00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:26.240]   all of a sudden, my life improved immeasurably once my wife was home. Now, at that point,
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:31.040]   she was quite pregnant, as I imagine, and the baby was, of course, going to change things.
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:37.960]   But my life improved immeasurably. And I had not realized how much nicer things would be
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:45.880]   if my wife had more time. She became more relaxed. She had more energy, was able to
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:51.920]   do more interesting things. Our food became more interesting. She had time for some personal
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:57.380]   growth activities and personal entertainment and things that she'd previously ignored because
[00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:03.760]   she had time to be at home. And as a husband, it made me feel awesome to see that improvement
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:08.400]   for her. It made me feel really great to see how much more she was enjoying not having
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:13.340]   to go to work and report to a boss every day. And in time, I've came to really, really appreciate
[00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:18.520]   how much better my life was getting when I had a wife who had the time and the freedom
[00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:25.120]   to focus on me and our household and our family's needs and goals, instead of a wife who was
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:30.560]   torn in two directions, trying to produce a profit for her employer, while also trying
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:37.000]   to care for our family. Now, we came to that decision fairly quickly. It was a little over
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.320]   a year of marriage, something like that. She quit very quickly. But at this point, when
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:47.720]   I look back, if knowing what I now know, I wish she had quit faster, because our lives
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:57.800]   became much, much better. Her life and my life became much, much better. Now, interestingly,
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:05.840]   in addition to that, our financial opportunities expanded significantly. And I think one of
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:13.360]   the most under discussed components of financial productivity, especially for married couples,
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:19.960]   is just simply how hard it is for two people who are engaged in careers, especially if
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:24.280]   they have children, most importantly, of course, if they have children, let's not fool ourselves.
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:30.000]   But it's very hard to build two profitable and productive careers and to have a quality
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.320]   home life, a quality family life. Now, if a couple does not have children, and if a
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:42.280]   couple lives a very simple lifestyle, don't have a big house, it's a very simple lifestyle,
[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:46.120]   and they don't want children, and they're both going to be involved in careers, then
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:50.640]   I think that it's fairly obvious that that decision right there, they can still be extremely
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:57.280]   financially productive. If you can put a $250,000 salary on top of another $250,000 salary and
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:05.080]   have the savings of living together, having things concentrated, etc., you have a great
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:13.480]   opportunity for wealth. And I think that there's no question that if that couple continues
[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:16.720]   to work together and both continue to earn lots of money and contribute lots of money,
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:21.920]   they're going to be really wealthy. And financially, I can't make the argument with a straight
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:26.160]   face that somehow if the husband or the wife goes home and stays at home, they're going
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:31.320]   to be better off financially. I do think that the lifestyle can improve, but when you make
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:34.640]   lots and lots of money, if you have lots of money, you can buy a lot of things done and
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:40.360]   still be in good shape. But the wrinkle comes in if you desire children, and if you desire
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:48.880]   to have a quality, rewarding, fulfilling family life. I don't see how it's possible for a
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:55.880]   couple where both the husband and the wife have normal jobs, I don't see how it's possible
[00:09:55.880 --> 00:10:04.040]   for either of them to really succeed in a career without facing a major problem and
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:09.800]   having your family life really suffer. And I think it's an extremely inefficient model
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:13.840]   to pursue. In fact, it's the worst model to pursue. Time and time again, I find myself
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:19.360]   doing consultations with clients where both the husband and the wife have good professional
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:24.360]   jobs. And my answer to them all the time is basically, "Yeah, you're doing fine. You have
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:28.280]   good incomes, and that's great." They say, "Joshua, how do we lower our tax bill?" And
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:33.160]   my answer is simply, "You can't. There is nothing that you can do if both a husband
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:40.800]   and a wife earn high W-2 incomes. You are the most highly taxed possible household in
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:46.920]   existence. And what's worse is that you have the highest possible personal expenses in
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:51.960]   existence." So it's an incredibly inefficient model. And then when you bring in the demands
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:56.640]   of children, and you bring in normal, loving parents who want the best for their children
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:01.840]   and want a strong family life, it's almost impossible to do that and succeed at a career.
[00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:07.160]   If you want to really make a lot of money, if you want to really build a big business,
[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:15.440]   it will require a huge amount of time and a huge amount of energy. And if you feel like
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:20.440]   your children are being neglected because of the time and the energy required for you
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:25.480]   to build your career, you're probably not going to build that career. Now, when you
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:29.520]   think it through and you say, "Well, what's the marker of my children being neglected?"
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:36.640]   Well, usually it's just lack of time with parents. Complete lack of time with parents.
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:41.080]   I've known and worked with some very successful couples, big career for husband, big career
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:46.880]   for wife, massive income levels, massive levels of wealth, who can afford to hire the very
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:53.840]   best caretakers for their children. Live-in nanny, live-in au pair, housekeepers for everything,
[00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:58.000]   the world's best teachers, nanny to take the children back and forth from the best school
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:06.560]   in the community, etc. Can those parents make a lot of money? Yeah, they can. My experience
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:12.400]   has been the majority of the time though, they see how their lack of presence is having
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:18.160]   an impact on their children. Now, whether that comes out in the short term or the long
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:22.000]   term, don't know. And every couple has to do with the very best that they believe, what
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.040]   they believe is best for their family. But I think often it's just simply an unnecessary
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:36.520]   cost. It's an unnecessary cost to the family. And yet, if you have, for me for example,
[00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:42.960]   my business and my job can take a significant amount of time. But because I know that my
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:47.800]   wife is fully involved with the children, because I know that my children aren't with
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:52.280]   a stranger, they're not sitting in an after-school program waiting to be picked up by somebody
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:56.360]   that I send on rushed out, because I know that they have their mom there to protect
[00:12:56.360 --> 00:13:00.960]   them, to care for them, to love them, and to support them, it makes it easy for me to
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:07.120]   do the work that I need to do. If I need to work late, family dinner still happens. Now,
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:12.560]   it may happen without me, which is less than ideal, and very rarely happens, but at least
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:17.800]   I know their mother is there. At least they still have that same constant ability. And
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:22.240]   in time, if you care about building family wealth, and you care about building multi-generational
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:29.000]   wealth, you're going to have to build a strong family culture that will see your family through
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:36.280]   in time. And you cannot build a strong family culture, you cannot build rich and rewarding
[00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:44.520]   relationships with your children when they're being raised by paid professionals. Doesn't
[00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:55.080]   happen. So, from a wealth productivity perspective, I am personally convinced that there's far
[00:13:55.080 --> 00:14:05.760]   more of a compounding effect to have one very large and productive career, and to have one
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:15.240]   very solid and loving family leader, family facilitator. That way you can have the best
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:20.000]   of both worlds. You can have a very large income, you can have a very large business,
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:27.600]   and you can have a strong family culture. I don't know how to prove this, but here's
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:32.600]   in a nutshell what I'm saying. I'm personally convinced that if you have a, let's say you
[00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:38.760]   have a 30 year old mother and father. And a 30 year old mother and father both have,
[00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:43.840]   let's just say they both earn $80,000 per year. Each of them earns $80,000 per year,
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:50.400]   and they have two or three children. I'm personally convinced that because of the constraints of
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:55.720]   trying to raise children effectively, and the fact that they both be working 40 hours
[00:14:55.720 --> 00:15:01.120]   a week, rushing home to get the kids and have family dinner real quick before bed, baths
[00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:08.320]   and beds. That if you look at the career trajectory of both of them with a 40 hour work week,
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:19.480]   it's not going to be nearly as high of a growth rate as if you have one career where you can
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:27.640]   put in 60 to 70 hours a week. I'm convinced that one career will compound more based upon
[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:32.960]   more time, more freedom to invest in it. But that would be a tremendous cost to the children
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:39.360]   if you had both careers doing that. And so it's much better to have mom take care of
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:46.680]   the children, dad build the family business, and in time you have a strong family culture
[00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:51.160]   and a tremendous income. Don't know how to prove that, don't know how to even research
[00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:56.480]   it, but that's my instinct. Now what I can prove to you is you have an opportunity for
[00:15:56.480 --> 00:16:07.760]   a far more efficient financial life if you separate the income and the spending. Now
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:14.880]   I was fortunate, and I say that very sincerely, I was fortunate in the fact that my wife,
[00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:19.040]   she never had big career ambitions and she didn't make a ton of money. And so we didn't
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:23.720]   have to face that very difficult decision that some couples face where both the husband
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:27.920]   and the wife make a lot of money. Now I've done shows on the past on how to calculate
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:37.160]   the true cost of working, etc. But I'm thankful that we didn't need to do that. But the thing
[00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:42.880]   I have learned is that if you care about an efficient, productive life, it's hard to do
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:49.600]   that with two full-time incomes in a household, again, and children. The reason often comes
[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:57.840]   down to cost of goods and taxes. With taxes, the most impactful taxes are income taxes
[00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:06.400]   and sales taxes. When you have two W-2 incomes in a house, you have the highest possible
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:10.040]   tax rates in that scenario. We have a high income and you have high taxes. And because
[00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:17.880]   of the, blanking on a call, progressive, because of the progressive tax system in the United
[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:22.240]   States, the more money you make, the more you pay in taxes. And so the less and less
[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:27.520]   incentive you have to work. Now another big challenge is that when purchasing things,
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:31.960]   you pay a lot of taxes to buy things where most of us live in sales tax states. And if
[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:36.820]   you have one person who's exclusively focused on the well-being of the household and who's
[00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:44.300]   focused on getting the household efficient in its spending, and you have the other person
[00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:50.480]   who's focused on earning income, you can have a far more efficient financial life. Let me
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:57.400]   give you some examples of some things that play into account. Something as simple as,
[00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:00.240]   let's say you're a couple, and I'm going to leave children out of it at the beginning
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:05.140]   here. Let's say that you're a couple and you want to choose a house to live in. That's
[00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:10.360]   an activity that can take a very significant amount of time. It can take time to find a
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:16.440]   really great deal, whether it's on a rental house or on a house to buy. And yet if you're
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:23.040]   trying to juggle that time around your work, it can be difficult. Whereas if you have more
[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:26.280]   time, you know, my wife, you know, if I say to my wife, "Listen, we've got to find a place
[00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:30.680]   to live." And if she's just got time to go and look for a house, she can find us a great
[00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:35.300]   house to live in. She can find us a great house to buy. She has the time and the ability
[00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:41.520]   to go and look at 50 houses before we buy one, instead of us rushing around on Tuesday
[00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:45.840]   night at 7.30 PM or rushing around on Saturday morning to see four showings. And we get so
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:50.960]   tired of that, we look at 15 houses before we buy one. And those numbers of the time
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:57.680]   required to find a deal, those numbers of savings can be really, really significant.
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:02.560]   So that's an example of an activity that my wife can do because of her time freedom that
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:08.880]   I can't do if I'm busy working at a job where I've got to be there from 8 to 5 every day.
[00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:13.320]   And that's just the start of it. What about getting that house fixed up and decorating
[00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:18.080]   it, furnishing it, etc.? Well, if you're busy at a job from 8 to 5 every day and you want
[00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:21.200]   to decorate the house, you've got a little time on Saturday, a little time on Sunday
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:26.880]   afternoon to do that, but not nearly as much time as if, you know, my wife, she's got a
[00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:31.440]   full week to do it. And so maybe you don't have time to paint all that much or you're
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:35.080]   going to come home, what most of us do, and I'm not trying to be unreasonable, but I am
[00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:38.960]   trying to make a point. So I'm not saying that you would just automatically hire painters,
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:43.000]   but you know what? A lot of people do. It's hard to go to a job every day, work from 8
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.600]   to 5, and then come home and paint the house. So one of the things that my wife always enjoyed
[00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:51.680]   doing a lot of was painting. I never liked painting. Oh, and she had time to paint stuff?
[00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:56.080]   She's got time. She can do it on Tuesday morning and work from 10 o'clock to noon, turn on
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:20:01.280]   some nice music, she's relaxed, the light is good, and she can enjoy that painting process.
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:06.760]   And the savings there are really significant. The labor is really, really valuable. She
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:12.720]   has the time to go and look through the seconds or the returns at the Home Depot paint desk
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:17.760]   and get the paint for cheaper, or buy it at a garage sale, buy it on Craigslist. These
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:23.520]   savings add up. They're all little, but they add up big time. So if we hired painters or
[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:28.920]   if we paid retail price for paint, well, we wind up paying a high price for the paint
[00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:34.920]   versus getting it on Craigslist cheap. And we wind up paying sales tax on that paint
[00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:40.400]   versus no sales tax buying it on Craigslist. And we have to, if we hire painters, well,
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:46.520]   she can do the painting with no need for us to pay from out of tax income, no need for
[00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:56.440]   us to pay, you know, we lose 15% on employment taxes, lose another, say, 15 to 30% on income
[00:20:56.440 --> 00:21:02.120]   taxes. So instead of losing 70 cents on the dollar, she gets those savings for doing that
[00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:06.840]   work herself. So hiring painters can only be done with after tax dollars. What about
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:12.120]   furnishing a house? Well, if we've just got time to go and look at furniture on Saturday
[00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:17.880]   morning, we're going to be pretty constrained to just paying retail. One of the highest
[00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:25.560]   markups out there is furniture. But if my wife has time to do the planning herself,
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:29.440]   she can go online, she can look around on Craigslist, she can look around on Facebook,
[00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:33.760]   she can, has the time to put together to go and pick up some of that stuff. She can save
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:37.840]   a huge amount on the cost of furnishing. My wife finds most of our furniture on the side
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:42.660]   of the road or finds it on Craigslist. She brings it home and sands it down and then
[00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:47.200]   repaints it. And then now we've got a great looking furniture that was practically free,
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:52.160]   sometimes completely free, just the cost of paint. Decorating, getting stuff cheaply and
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:56.960]   then putting, having the time to create something rather than just to go out and buy the expensive
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:05.400]   after tax thing. Is this a big deal if you have a million dollar household income? No.
[00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:11.860]   But is it a big deal if you've got an $80,000 household income? It's huge. These savings
[00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:18.240]   add up massively. What about just simply making a home pleasant to be in? One of the single
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:26.080]   most valuable things that my wife does is to work to make our house nice. To make it
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:31.440]   a place that we want to be. And if your home is a place that you like to be, that you enjoy
[00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:36.560]   being, you're far less likely to want to run away all the time and go out and spend money
[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:42.320]   constantly. I don't know how to articulate exactly how she does it, but there's something
[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:50.680]   special about a house that is built and that is put together with love that makes it nice
[00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:56.240]   to be in. So the place that you want to be on Tuesday night is at home. The place that
[00:22:56.240 --> 00:23:02.560]   you want to be on Saturday morning is at home. What about the cost and the work of cleaning
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:08.520]   and maintaining a house? Well, you can hire a maid, you can hire a handyman, but those
[00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:14.320]   expenses are always done with after-tax money, which means there's automatically maybe 30%
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:20.240]   higher expenses because you get 70 cents on the dollar after it. But yet, if my wife has
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:24.840]   the time to do that kind of thing, to clean the house, to maintain it, to do some of the
[00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:33.360]   little jobs, it creates a tremendous cost savings. What about yard work, landscaping,
[00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:38.400]   gardening? Well, obviously, that stuff adds up. I don't have a lot of incentive if I'm
[00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:42.280]   working 50 hours a week and my wife is working 50 hours a week and the only time we have
[00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:46.860]   together is Saturday and Sunday. I don't have a lot of incentive not to go ahead and pay
[00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:51.560]   the $300 a month or $200 a month to pay a professional landscaper to come and cut the
[00:23:51.560 --> 00:24:05.120]   grass because I need that time back. But if she does it, she can do it on Tuesday morning
[00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:11.360]   when it's cool and there's savings there, financial savings and lifestyle savings. What
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:16.860]   about things like growing food, landscaping? One of the most valuable, biggest returns
[00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:23.800]   on investment is from a home garden, from home fruit trees, from home vegetables. Go
[00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:27.960]   to your grocery store, look at the cost of fruit, look at the cost of vegetables and
[00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:32.960]   look at your land and realize that you've got all the necessary elements sitting there
[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:40.360]   to create that stuff for you. But what does gardening cost? Time. Not necessarily a huge
[00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:48.600]   amount of time, but it needs consistent time, a little bit every day. So if my wife can
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:53.920]   grow a garden, she can reduce our food bill by hundreds of dollars per month. And again,
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:25:00.960]   all after tax savings. Much more efficient. A home flock of chickens, some home animals.
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:09.920]   Very very useful. Better quality, more nutrient dense and cheaper. Can also be profitable
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:15.480]   too as far as a home business. What about shopping? One of the really valuable things
[00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:20.780]   that my wife can do is she has the time to go and to shop for the needs of the household.
[00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:26.640]   So if we need clothes or we need food, we need things like that. She has the ability
[00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:31.440]   to do those things far less expensively. It's been harder since we left the United States,
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:39.960]   but when we were in the United States, we bought a total of I think four outfits for
[00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:47.360]   our children. Every other piece of clothing that our children wore was free. The four
[00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:51.520]   outfits that we bought was just simply because they were cute and we wanted them. It was
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:56.000]   just a splurge. It wasn't necessary. But every other piece of clothing for our children was
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.280]   free. The shoes that they wore, free. Now we have not been able to continue that since
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:05.600]   leaving the United States simply because where we live now, the free market is not as abundant
[00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:09.860]   as it was back there. Thankfully we have tremendous other cost savings and so now we spend money
[00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:13.800]   on clothes like normal people. But when we were in the United States, it was tremendous.
[00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:18.600]   And my wife had all of bins of clothes laid out for all the coming years of the children.
[00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:23.960]   And what did that cost? Well not money, but time. So she would make it, we would take
[00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:28.160]   all the hand-me-downs from other people whose children were growing up. We would keep our
[00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:34.320]   ears open for things that were available in the free market. My wife would watch the diaper
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:37.480]   groups, she'd watch the cloth diaper groups and take free bundles of cloth diapers and
[00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:40.560]   whatnot from other people or from people who their kids outgrew it and they were getting
[00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:44.040]   rid of their stuff. She'd watch the mother groups and go and pick the stuff up. Then
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:47.480]   she'd sort through it, get the stains out of stuff, keep the stuff she wanted and get
[00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:51.000]   rid of the other stuff. Sometimes she would buy and sell it. So she would pay some for
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.440]   cloth diapers, keep the ones she wanted, then resell the other ones on eBay and make a profit
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:27:02.040]   on some of those things. If you calculate the cost of clothing for children, it's tremendously,
[00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:07.680]   it's very expensive. You get all of it for free. You save money on the money required
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:12.880]   to buy it, right, which was all after tax money. No way to save on that. You save money
[00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:19.400]   on the purchase price, no sales tax, no expensive retail clothing. It's a tremendous, tremendous
[00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:24.720]   financial value. Other things like the needs of the food needs, etc. The ability to go
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:28.640]   and get this from this store and that from that store. When it's Saturday morning and
[00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:32.320]   all you've got is Saturday morning to do all your errands, it gets so annoying to try to
[00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:36.680]   go to eight different stores to capture the sales. But if you've got time to spread it
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:39.920]   out through the week. I always grew up with my mom, we'd go to four or five different
[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:44.120]   stores and she would get, she knew she always got her meat from this store and she shopped
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:47.120]   the sales at this store and she went to the bulk food store for this and went to the health
[00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:51.600]   food store for that and just a little bit there. That costs time, but it's a major,
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:57.800]   major savings. Major savings because of the lower cost, the after tax savings, hundreds
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:02.340]   of dollars per month. Really big deal. What about things like the work involved of doing
[00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:07.360]   things like preparing food? When you have somebody who has the time to cook, to cook
[00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:13.360]   from scratch, you can get far better, far more interesting and far healthier food at
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:18.400]   pennies on the dollar. Much, much better. When my wife and I were both working at a
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:22.680]   job, we wound up, even though we didn't even have children, we wound up eating out quite
[00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:26.760]   a lot because you'd come home, come home at 5.30, 6 o'clock, you're hungry. Maybe you
[00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:30.000]   put something in the crock pot beforehand, but then you get tired of crock pot food.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.700]   No, it's chicken and carrots and onions and potatoes again in the crock pot. You get tired
[00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:40.040]   of crock pot food. And so you wind up going out all the time. Now you add children into
[00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:43.880]   the mix and it's even more than that where you wind up going out all the time. Whereas
[00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:47.720]   if she's got time and she can make something that's interesting, that takes time, learning
[00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:53.840]   a new technique, you have better, more interesting and healthier food at pennies on the dollar.
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:29:00.520]   Huge opportunity to save money and to make a huge contribution to the household. Things
[00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:04.920]   like supervising professionals when their services are needed. Let's say that you've
[00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:11.280]   got a guy coming to fix the cable. Well, that can impact your work schedule significantly.
[00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:14.360]   Mom and dad are both working. You got a guy coming to fix the cable. He's only going to
[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:19.620]   come sometime between 9am and 6pm, right? Because that's the time slot they give you.
[00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:23.320]   So you stay home from work and you take a personal day and maybe you try to work a little
[00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:27.680]   bit from home, but you're not nearly as effective and productive as you are if you were at your
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:31.880]   office actually working during that time. But if my wife's at home, she's got to meet
[00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:36.520]   the cable guy. She's got the time to do it. Or somebody's coming to work on the house.
[00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:40.500]   She has the ability to supervise them. And perhaps that supervision enables you to get
[00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:44.800]   better results. Handyman's coming to work on the house, but she's there to watch him
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:48.480]   to make sure that things are done and that things are done well. Probably going to work
[00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:53.240]   tiny bit harder, little bit faster, etc. So supervising professionals when they're needed
[00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:59.240]   is a big, big deal. Or having the ability to assist professionals when they're needed.
[00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:03.560]   So the ability to hire somebody who's a lone guy and he comes over and says, "Okay, I'll
[00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:07.340]   come over and work on Tuesday." But one of the things I found when I've done construction
[00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:12.760]   work is that if you don't have somebody who can help you as a construction worker, you
[00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:16.680]   wind up spending all your time going to get supplies and things from the store. Really,
[00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:20.080]   really frustrating. It's very hard to work in a business like that and then also to work
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:25.920]   on a business. Well, you can hire some guy who comes over and moonlights and then my
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:29.760]   wife can go and get things from the store. My parents built a house when we were younger.
[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:33.880]   And one of the things that my mom did that was just such an incredible asset to the process
[00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:37.360]   is that she was always the gopher. My dad would be working on the house or there'd be
[00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:44.800]   other professionals and when they needed something, instead of one of the very expensive workers
[00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:48.760]   having to stop and go to Home Depot, my mom would be able to go to Home Depot for them.
[00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:53.480]   Saved them thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars on the house because you kept the
[00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:56.420]   professionals, the professional plumber, the professional electrician, the professional
[00:30:56.420 --> 00:31:02.160]   builders kept them at work. Major, major contribution to the family budget. You have the ability
[00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:07.200]   just to handle the errands and administrative items from the household. The visit to the
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:15.480]   bank, the visit to go and renew the car insurance or renew the registration, etc. When my wife,
[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:19.400]   if she's got the time to do those things during the day, those are things that I don't have
[00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:25.000]   to do at night and on the weekends. And that's a tremendous benefit to the value of the family,
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:30.560]   to the family culture. It's so much easier to do those errands and administrative items
[00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:34.760]   during business hours than it is to try to work them all in at night and on the weekends
[00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:41.120]   or take PTO to do them on a Tuesday. You have the opportunity to make better household decisions.
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:45.920]   She has time to do the financial tracking or to go and to carefully shop among the different
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:51.880]   internet providers or to shop about investment providers. How do we choose the best investments?
[00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:56.480]   Sometimes, if so inclined, your wife may have the ability to run an investment portfolio
[00:31:56.480 --> 00:32:00.400]   really effectively. We'll talk about this more in entrepreneurship. But one of the most
[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:05.920]   important things that you can do to live a tax efficient lifestyle is make sure that
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:11.360]   you don't have two W-2 incomes. And at the very least, that you have one W-2 income and
[00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:18.360]   you have one business owner and/or investor. Far more efficient to have one wage earner
[00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:26.800]   and one business owner or investor in the couple than to have two W-2 incomes. So things
[00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:33.760]   like managing rental houses, again, overseeing and supervising workers and things like that
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:37.320]   are much more effectively done when you're not simultaneously trying to hold down an
[00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:45.200]   hourly job. Very importantly, if my wife is not trying to keep a job every day and earn
[00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:52.400]   a paycheck, she has the opportunity to be a far better member of the local community.
[00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:59.440]   In my opinion, one of the major losses in US American culture, broadly speaking, one
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:05.440]   of the major losses in US American culture due to both moms and dads working full-time
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:13.160]   jobs has been the destruction of local community life. I used to be a financial advisor. When
[00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:17.400]   I was doing that, I would drive around a lot. If you drive into the vast majority of suburban
[00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:24.600]   neighborhoods during the day, during the afternoon, they're dead. There's nobody there. There's
[00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:30.840]   no vibrant community life because there's nobody there. The mom and dad are downtown
[00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:36.520]   working at a job. The children are institutionalized in a school or in an after-school program
[00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:40.720]   or somewhere out. They can't be at home because we can't have our kids at home, right? Can't
[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:47.240]   be alone, too dangerous. And so there's almost nobody in that local community. But if my
[00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:52.440]   wife can be there in the local community, she has time to take care of somebody who's
[00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:57.640]   sick or in need. Very difficult when you have mom and dad both working a job 40 hours a
[00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:03.560]   week and Aunt Lois is sick. Who's going to go and take care of Aunt Lois? Well, my wife
[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:08.840]   can do that if she's got time. Or to go and help a mother who needs help with children,
[00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:14.760]   to go and care for an elderly parent. Those things build together a community because
[00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:19.200]   now you have the opportunity to volunteer your time. You don't have to get paid. It's
[00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:25.320]   very difficult for somebody who's earning an income to keep their job and simultaneously
[00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:29.760]   fulfill their family responsibilities and still feel like they have time to volunteer.
[00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:33.960]   Some people do it. Their sleep usually suffers, which affects their health often. Some people
[00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:39.320]   do it. But it's very difficult. So it's much easier for somebody who's earning a job and
[00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:43.800]   trying to maintain their own personal and family life to send some money, to send a
[00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:49.120]   card, to make a donation, etc. to try to buy something with money. But often, although
[00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:53.200]   that's appreciated, obviously, you know, a gift card for groceries helps somebody who's
[00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:59.000]   sick who can't work, etc. But often the time and the relational support, the emotional
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:07.520]   support can make a much, much bigger impact. But in modern life, people who have jobs can't
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:16.360]   afford to commit the time for that stuff without a major cost to some other part of their life.
[00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:22.280]   So my wife has the ability to be a far better member of a local community because she doesn't
[00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:26.160]   have to work a job every day. Because she doesn't have to figure out how to keep a business
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:32.200]   profitable. She can just focus on family and community and do those things well. And that
[00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:41.880]   kind of community life has untold dividends in the long run, financially and otherwise.
[00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:46.560]   Could be as simple as having people to care for your children for you when you need to,
[00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:50.520]   when you need to work. Could be as simple as having neighbors who can come over and
[00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:55.560]   babysit for you without charging you money. Can be as simple as having a friend who loves
[00:35:55.560 --> 00:36:01.360]   you, who will listen to you so you don't have to pay a therapist to listen to all your problems.
[00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:07.720]   There are far-reaching ripple effects of having strong community members where not everybody,
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:13.280]   day and night, is thinking about making a buck.
[00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:20.160]   Now thus far I've said nothing about children. I've just talked about the value of my wife
[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:25.300]   being able to care for our family regardless of children. And the thing that I didn't expect
[00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:28.520]   when I got married is I didn't expect that there would be benefits there. I thought there
[00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:32.520]   would be benefits for children. But I didn't expect that there would be benefits without
[00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:36.960]   that. A lot of people have this idea that, okay, yes, we see that it's useful for mom
[00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:41.240]   to be at home when there are children growing. But then as soon as children are out of the
[00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:44.320]   house then mom's going to go back to a job.
[00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:49.560]   Listen, you make your own decisions. It's a free world. What I'm trying to articulate
[00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:57.280]   to you is that I don't ever want her to have to go back to a job. Because her lifestyle,
[00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:09.080]   my lifestyle, and our family lifestyle is far better. Far, far better. Even without
[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:15.280]   regard to the children. But now when you bring children in it becomes 10x in terms of the
[00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:27.240]   value. Obviously, the basic thing comes when you have babies. It is far better, more satisfying
[00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:33.360]   and easier for a mom who's able to be at home full time to be able to birth babies and care
[00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:41.840]   for them. Far, far better. Possibly you can have an easier time conceiving a child. Stress
[00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:47.080]   and tiredness and chronic sleep deprivation, those things can affect a woman's fertility.
[00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:52.640]   Many couples struggle with infertility. Perhaps that might be improved by your wife being
[00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:58.280]   more relaxed, having more time, being healthier, being able to sleep, being able to care for
[00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:05.200]   herself, eat quality food, etc. I don't know, but that might be something. Certainly, you
[00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:12.920]   have the opportunity for smoother, easier childbirth due to a lower stress lifestyle.
[00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:17.000]   Very difficult for a mother to work, work, work, work, okay it's 40 weeks and I'm going
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:21.480]   to work until I start to feel birth pains and then I'm just going to race to the hospital
[00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:27.360]   and have a baby. Decent formula right there for starting the process towards a difficult
[00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:33.440]   childbirth which ends in a very expensive medical bill for a C-section. Very C-section,
[00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:38.320]   extremely traumatic for a mother, difficult and traumatic for a baby. A lot of time to
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:44.560]   recover so now the experience of having a baby is a medical emergency, it's a trauma
[00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:50.400]   instead of something that a mom can recover from much more easily. If you can facilitate
[00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:55.080]   a lower stress, a more relaxed lifestyle, you have the opportunity for a smoother, easier
[00:38:55.080 --> 00:39:00.240]   childbirth which is good for mom. Mom can recover more quickly. Good for baby, the baby
[00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:06.640]   has less trauma at birth and a head start on growth. Really good for the lifelong bonding
[00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:10.880]   of mother and baby, especially in those first few days and then in that first year or two
[00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:17.280]   you have tremendous emotional stability of the baby due to mom's constant presence. Mom
[00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:23.920]   being there, breastfeeding, constantly involved in the life of the baby, a universal constant
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:29.440]   for that child makes an incredible impact on the child's emotional stability and also
[00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:33.640]   far healthier. Breastfeeding leads to far healthier baby, things like that. Healthier
[00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:39.480]   for baby and healthier for mom. Better hormone experience, joy, I can't remember the names
[00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:45.640]   of all the hormones but just much better experience for mom and much more opportunity to bond
[00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:52.120]   and I think less insulting. I've had friends who went back to work and they were super
[00:39:52.120 --> 00:40:01.080]   hardcore kind of crunchy people so they made sure that they were going to pump breast milk
[00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:06.680]   for their children and they did it, they do it but it just always seems kind of, I don't
[00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:11.600]   know, I really appreciate the mother's dedication and they're super dedicated to the health
[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:16.960]   of their baby but it always just seems a little bit crass to me, this idea that a mom has
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:23.800]   to be sitting on her computer with a breast pump on her breast pumping milk in her office
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:32.160]   or in some quiet corner. It just seems really insulting, really artificial. Hats off to
[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:35.840]   the moms that do it, they really work hard, it's really tough for them but it's never
[00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:39.240]   something I've wanted for my wife. I never wanted her to be in that weird circumstance.
[00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:44.760]   It's night and day different versus now, she can breastfeed a baby and sit in a quiet,
[00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:49.480]   comfortable chair, look out the window at a beautiful, tranquil scene and enjoy the
[00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:55.360]   sunshine and bond with her baby instead of trying to figure out how to be super mom.
[00:40:55.360 --> 00:41:00.760]   And then as children grow, the ability for a mom to focus fully on training children
[00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:06.280]   and investing into their self-development, I'm convinced that that constant presence
[00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:12.360]   of mom, especially in those early years, the most important time, babies and children need
[00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:19.240]   mom in those early years. They don't need dad, they need mom. They do need dad but not
[00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:23.000]   nearly as much as mom. Down the road they need dad more but in those early years they
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:28.080]   need their mom. And I'm convinced that that constant presence of a mom dramatically changes
[00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:34.720]   a child's self-confidence and sense of security. Now it's often, in my opinion, really draining
[00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:40.180]   on mom. Young children can be so draining which is why so many mothers are desperate
[00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:46.360]   to go back to work. They're really draining and they just call, "Mommy, mommy, mommy"
[00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:51.680]   all day. It really makes you feel worn down. But yet you can look at the flip side of it
[00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:57.040]   and see that constant presence, how that impacts the child where they don't even think about
[00:41:57.040 --> 00:42:01.120]   the, "Is mom not going to be there?" The reason they call mommy, mommy, mommy all the time
[00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:08.040]   is because mom's in constant universal presence. And as draining as that is, there's not a
[00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:12.040]   daycare worker in the world who's going to care more about your child than you do. There's
[00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:15.280]   not a kindergarten teacher in the world who's going to care more about your child than you
[00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:22.840]   do. What I try to encourage my wife is I say, "Listen, let's all acknowledge that children
[00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:27.400]   can be really draining. And as husbands, let's work really hard to make sure that our wives
[00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:32.420]   get the support that they need, the help that they need, the respite care that they need
[00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:38.240]   so that they can feel really good." But think about how draining it is for your children.
[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:45.120]   "Mommy, mommy, mommy." Now imagine that you, instead of having one or two or three or four
[00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:54.320]   of little ones to care for, now imagine you've got 12 of them to care for all day, every
[00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:58.520]   day. And now instead of working for the good of your family, you're working for a fairly
[00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:04.520]   mediocre paycheck and you have no biological connection to those children. Is that person
[00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:08.640]   going to do a better job managing the stress and the frustration of the "mommy, mommy,
[00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:14.560]   mommy," the constant demands on their time and their emotions? Daycare workers try really,
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:20.800]   really hard. Teachers work really, really hard to be the best they can, but they simply
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:26.480]   cannot possibly care more than you. They have no biological connection to the children.
[00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:30.880]   They're working out of their natural sense of empathy and work. That has an impact on
[00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:37.720]   a child. So I'm convinced that that constant presence of a mom dramatically changes a child's
[00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:45.740]   self-confidence, which sets them up for a lifetime of success. You have far more opportunities
[00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:51.700]   for the children to enjoy interesting experiences. I think one of the biggest costs to young
[00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:58.000]   children when they're raised by institutional professionals instead of by moms and dads
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:02.440]   is the limitation on their experiences. Now there can come a point in time at which that
[00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:07.640]   can change. For example, let's say that your child is, your 12-year-old is really interested
[00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:12.000]   in science. Well, they're going to probably be able to get a far better equipped science
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:17.240]   lab at the local high school or the local private school than they are at home. The
[00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:21.840]   science lab equipment at home is probably going to be fairly minimal. But for a young
[00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:28.560]   child, the opportunities that are available for the child in an institution are very limited.
[00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:34.840]   It's one building, one campus, one room all day every day. And maybe there are four field
[00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:39.400]   trips per year, but it's nothing like the opportunity that a mother has to take her
[00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:45.120]   child out for interesting experiences. Of course, there's lots that can be done at home.
[00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:50.640]   And here's where financial, it's nice to have the money where you can buy interesting toys,
[00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:55.040]   have interesting games, have interesting activities for the child to do at home. But just the
[00:44:55.040 --> 00:45:01.840]   ability of time to go out on out of the house adventures, library trips, park trips, zoo
[00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:07.440]   trips, excursions, field trips, those things can be done every week. Most of the time,
[00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:09.960]   you know, your mom will get together with a play group of other moms and they have the
[00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:12.320]   ability to say every week, "Hey, we're going to go to the zoo. We're going to go to the
[00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:16.800]   park. We're going to go to the beach. We're going to go to do these activities." And so
[00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:24.400]   the child has a more interesting and diverse life experience than can be accomplished in
[00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:31.520]   the local daycare. Far more time to play with other children instead of it just being, daycare
[00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:34.760]   is a little bit questionable on this claim, but you have just more time to play with other
[00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:39.040]   children. If they have siblings, hopefully, more time to play with their siblings, more
[00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:45.880]   time to have play dates with other children at the park, etc. And then if you take a little
[00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:52.680]   bit more of a global interest in your educational plan, now all of a sudden you can really open
[00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:59.640]   up the opportunities. This is not simply possible with just, you know, mom staying at home.
[00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:04.840]   We get to entrepreneurship, which we'll get to as a point of freedom, but it is possible.
[00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:11.120]   My children have been to dozens of different states with a huge diversity and variety of
[00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:16.160]   experiences in all those different states, from the beaches to the mountains, from the
[00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:21.360]   alligators to the horses and the cattle, just tremendous experiences, all kinds of different
[00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:25.200]   things. One of my favorite activities to do with our children was, I took them, last year
[00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:30.420]   we took them to the Cheyenne Frontier Days in Cheyenne, Wyoming. It's an incredible experience
[00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:35.400]   for them, seeing all these horses and seeing the rodeo, which by the way, plug for Cheyenne
[00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:40.080]   Frontier Days. If you're looking for a big midway and whatnot, and you come from a big
[00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:44.320]   city as I do, you won't be impressed by the midway. But if you want to see horses and
[00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:49.000]   carriages and all the stuff you only see in books, you want to see it in real life, the
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:54.560]   Cheyenne Frontier Days parade was just incredible to me. It was so cool to see all the stuff
[00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:59.120]   that you only ever read about working. You know, it was the first time last year, it
[00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:03.160]   was the first time in my life I've ever seen a six horse team in person. So cool to see
[00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:09.600]   that. Six horse team pulling a stagecoach, or see a milk wagon, or see a funeral hearse,
[00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:13.280]   a horse drawn funeral hearse, just really enjoyed it. And to be able to sit there and
[00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:19.360]   watch your children stare in wonder at those things is a tremendous experience. My children
[00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:24.720]   have been in multiple foreign countries in multiple languages. You can do that when you've
[00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:32.640]   got time and that leads to a much bigger horizon than just being institutionalized. I'm stealing
[00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:36.960]   my thunder from the next show, which will be on home education. So I'm going to stop
[00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:42.840]   here. But you have tremendous opportunities for your children because mom has time. Simple
[00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:48.760]   things like learning, schooling. Let's move on to schooling of children. The world's greatest
[00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:56.360]   teacher student ratio, know what it is? One to one. Schools fight to try to lower their
[00:47:56.360 --> 00:48:01.280]   teacher student ratio because the idea is that if a teacher has 30 students to care
[00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:05.120]   for, they're going to be less effective than if they have 20 students. Maybe it's true.
[00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:13.320]   I don't know. Maybe it is. But if it is true, a one to one teacher to student ratio, or
[00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:20.160]   a three to one teacher to student ratio, if you have three children, is a far better ratio
[00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:25.800]   than 20 or 30 to one, which leads to amazing opportunities for the child. You don't have
[00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:29.760]   to know anything about child development. All you got to do is read to your kids and
[00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:35.120]   they'll be reading in no time. You don't need some fancy expensive, you know, private school
[00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:41.320]   tuition, some fancy early start education program. It all happens naturally if you create
[00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:46.320]   a proper environment. And then you have the opportunity to work with the needs of your
[00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:52.120]   children. So instead of your child being lumped in with everyone else, mom can focus and say,
[00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:56.800]   well, look, you're not learning well that way, but you can learn in this other way.
[00:48:56.800 --> 00:49:04.160]   Or you know, the prescription for you, active son, is you need 30 minutes of hard running
[00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:09.920]   around and play to every 10 minutes of bookwork. It's a lot better than the child going nuts
[00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:14.480]   trying to do 30 minutes of bookwork and only getting 10 minutes of play. You have far more
[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:19.780]   interesting opportunities for learning. I'm not going to steal my thunder from the home
[00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:24.640]   education show, but time for small businesses. You know, my son's done things like building
[00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:28.960]   a little bread baking business. How else can you have a six year old be an entrepreneur
[00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:32.840]   and make money with learning to make money and save money and etc. If mom doesn't have
[00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:37.000]   time to help with that stuff. It's hard to do. Yeah, you can do it on Saturday, right?
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:42.280]   And I hope that you know my heart enough to know that every parent is going to do their
[00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:48.600]   very best. And so if you're the parent who, hey, we've got to have the two incomes, we're
[00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:52.880]   in a deep financial hole, we need the money. This is just what's best for our family. Fine.
[00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:55.160]   And so you're trying to figure out how to invest Saturday morning into your child. You
[00:49:55.160 --> 00:49:59.480]   can do it. You can help your child set up a bread baking business on Saturday morning.
[00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:04.080]   But if you're that parent, you got to admit, you'd be far more effective if you didn't
[00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:10.540]   have to simultaneously try to hold down a job while doing that. And you got to imagine
[00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:16.840]   that as good as you are as a parent with the 15 to 20 hours a week that you have available,
[00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:23.080]   you'd be a whole lot better at waking time. You'd be a whole lot better of a parent if
[00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:34.680]   you had 100 hours or 80 hours of waking time to parent your child. Then you have opportunities
[00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:40.760]   for better training. I have a strong willed child, disrespectful, rebellious, very challenging.
[00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:46.120]   I often wonder how that child would cope if it were being cared for by others. The child
[00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:53.440]   is exasperating enough. The child would drive other people completely bonkers. But yet,
[00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:58.440]   my wife and I, we have the time and the ability to work with the child, help the child to
[00:50:58.440 --> 00:51:04.000]   come under control, help the child to learn to manage their emotions. So for every challenge,
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:10.120]   it's better off if you got time and ability to focus. Imagine that you have a handicapped
[00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:17.480]   child, a legit handicap, whatever it is, difficult situation. Now, with the caveat
[00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:21.520]   of some institutions for certain handicaps have specialized equipment, which can be extremely
[00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:28.200]   valuable, you know as well as I do that you would never try to make the straight faced
[00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:37.400]   argument that somehow your handicap difficult child is better off because a paid professional
[00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:41.840]   is caring for them instead of you. I guess maybe that was too strong because again there
[00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:46.720]   are specialized equipment. But when you see moms and dads who have a handicapped child,
[00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:51.540]   it just focuses them in on saying I'm going to figure out how to get the very best results
[00:51:51.540 --> 00:51:56.840]   for this child. How do I help this child to learn in spite of their personal difficulties?
[00:51:56.840 --> 00:52:02.600]   And they pour themselves into that child. Well, if we do that for our handicapped children,
[00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:08.440]   why don't we do it for our non-handicapped children? If it would be that focusing for
[00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:14.280]   you to try to figure out how do I help my handicapped child deliver a more normal successful
[00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:20.720]   life in spite of their difficulties, then why do we not treat our so-called normal children
[00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:31.740]   with that same level of intensity and focus? Now, as I pivot to kind of my closing arguments
[00:52:31.740 --> 00:52:36.400]   and hopefully my motivational speech here, I do want to acknowledge that there's a real
[00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:42.200]   challenge with children where I gave a bunch of benefits of stay at home wife with no children,
[00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:46.680]   then children come in. Children increase the work and often increase the work beyond what
[00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:51.000]   is possible to maintain all of these things as efficiently as possible. So my wife and
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:55.640]   I, we have four children. What I have found, what we have found, as the size of our family
[00:52:55.640 --> 00:53:02.520]   has grown, we have less ability to do all those frugal things we once did. We have the
[00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:08.020]   need to start spending more money. I currently have a maid, I have a nanny. So the maid cleans
[00:53:08.020 --> 00:53:12.360]   the house, does the laundry, have a nanny, the nanny comes, plays with some of the children
[00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:20.280]   so that my wife can be freer to focus on the baby and to focus on the schooling, which
[00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:23.960]   just makes for a better lifestyle. And I'm very grateful that we have the money to do
[00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:29.200]   that. Not everybody does. So plan though, as your family grows, that you'll probably
[00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:32.640]   need to start spending more money for some of those things that perhaps your wife was
[00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:36.500]   once able to do. But then of course as your children grow, now they can take over some
[00:53:36.500 --> 00:53:42.040]   of those things. So just be careful that there are major financial costs to children and
[00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:46.440]   one of the major costs to children is that some of those other things fall away. You
[00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:52.120]   know, you wind up eating out more. If you don't have a paid cook, you wind up going
[00:53:52.120 --> 00:53:56.360]   and paying cooks at a restaurant to cook for you because you can't expect, if your wife
[00:53:56.360 --> 00:54:02.400]   is busy with children and homeschooling, etc., you can't expect her to be cooking all the
[00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:07.100]   time the same way that perhaps she could when she didn't have any children. So be very cautious
[00:54:07.100 --> 00:54:10.800]   there and be very in tune with those things and don't expect it to always be frugal. And
[00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:14.720]   in my opinion, it's one of the best things about money. Money should buy you lifestyle.
[00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:17.980]   And I'm grateful to have the money and have the ability to do that. It makes me really
[00:54:17.980 --> 00:54:23.140]   happy to see my wife with less work on her shoulders.
[00:54:23.140 --> 00:54:29.760]   My summary statements here are that you and your wife can have a far better quality of
[00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:38.560]   life and lifestyle if you're not both trying to hold down a job. My opinion, the family
[00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:45.780]   life of most modern American households sucks. Minimal time for each other, minimal time
[00:54:45.780 --> 00:54:51.780]   for children, have to work all the time to pay your taxes and to afford to be able to
[00:54:51.780 --> 00:54:57.860]   buy everything done for you. It just sucks and it's insanely expensive. And I know that
[00:54:57.860 --> 00:55:01.280]   most people don't like their jobs, they don't find satisfaction from them. And one of the
[00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:05.200]   ways that they could get a solution is what I'm talking about. That's why I'm doing this
[00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:10.840]   show about freedom. One path to freedom is what I'm talking about. If you have one spouse
[00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:16.800]   focused on the home front, the time that the family is together can be way, way better.
[00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:20.440]   All of a sudden, instead of your nights and your weekends filled with chores and activities
[00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:24.880]   and shopping, etc. Now all of a sudden, if your wife can do a lot of that stuff during
[00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:30.140]   the daytime hours, during the week, now your weekends open up. So instead of Saturday morning
[00:55:30.140 --> 00:55:34.600]   being the grocery shopping and yard work and work, work, work, work, you've got time for
[00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:39.680]   the beach, for the park, etc. Now instead of you having to come home and all of a sudden
[00:55:39.680 --> 00:55:43.320]   make dinner really quick, you can come home and play with your children. It can be an
[00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:50.880]   incredibly incredible lifestyle for dad and it can be an incredible lifestyle for mom.
[00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:55.840]   Not without problems, but I've often wondered why when you wander around the financial independence
[00:55:55.840 --> 00:56:01.600]   circles and everyone's really focused on financial independence, I've never read an essay that
[00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:09.920]   said become financially independent and stop working because you become a great wife and
[00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:16.240]   mother. My wife doesn't have an earning income. She's going to be supported for the rest of
[00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:21.200]   her life. Now there are risks there. One of the biggest things why marriage culture, divorce
[00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:27.840]   culture is so important, but she'll never have to earn an income for the rest of her
[00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:36.240]   life and yet she's got a tremendously valuable lifestyle. I've often read essays, a lot of
[00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:39.760]   times especially by women, I've often read essays by women who are pursuing financial
[00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:42.920]   independence and they talk about the things that they want to have time to do. I want
[00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:47.800]   to have time to exercise, cook healthier food, work on my art project and develop my calligraphy
[00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:55.280]   and have more time to spend with my parents, etc. My often obvious answer is why don't
[00:56:55.280 --> 00:57:01.840]   you marry a husband who would be thrilled for you to have that lifestyle. I love to
[00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:08.520]   see my wife fulfilled and have time for those things. It makes me feel really good to be
[00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:15.280]   able to provide a great lifestyle for her and I will happily work and earn income while
[00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:22.120]   we're not yet financially independent so that she can enjoy that. That's why I put this
[00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:30.520]   show next in the series, was when trying to figure out what order do I do this, I realized
[00:57:30.520 --> 00:57:33.600]   although the things I'm going to talk about later in the series are important. For example,
[00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:37.520]   I love being at home full time. You may be able to hear my children in the background
[00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:41.480]   talking in the other room. They're having their morning snack right now. I love being
[00:57:41.480 --> 00:57:45.880]   able to be home full time. My wife and I are home together with our children basically
[00:57:45.880 --> 00:57:53.000]   168 hours a week. I don't know how you get more time with your family than that. And
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:59.760]   entrepreneurship and working from home, etc. has opened that up. But knowing what I know
[00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:06.360]   now, the first thing I would do would be to make that same decision we made for my wife
[00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:11.800]   to be home full time. I would have done it sooner before children and I would have done
[00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:21.880]   it and I would have made sure of it. And if I had to choose between both of us doing something
[00:58:21.880 --> 00:58:24.720]   that was going to take us outside of the house or me going and working a job, having to give
[00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:28.560]   up business so that my wife could be at home, I would go do the job instead of a business
[00:58:28.560 --> 00:58:33.080]   so that my wife could be at home. That's how good the experience has been for me. I think
[00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:37.480]   the quality of life and the family life of most of modern American households stinks,
[00:58:37.480 --> 00:58:46.120]   but it doesn't have to. You can have a better home that's more beautiful, that's cleaner,
[00:58:46.120 --> 00:58:51.400]   that you like to be in, that's more pleasant, that's filled with love and joy. Give your
[00:58:51.400 --> 00:58:56.280]   wife the time to do that. The money to buy the things that are necessary, but the time
[00:58:56.280 --> 00:59:02.520]   to do that. You can eat better, have cheaper food, healthier, better. You can have better
[00:59:02.520 --> 00:59:07.040]   children who are more emotionally stable, they're smarter, they have better self-esteem,
[00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:12.200]   have a better vocabulary. You can have better weekends, better nights. Your nights and your
[00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:17.760]   weekends don't have to be consumed with chores all the time. You can have an easier time
[00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:24.320]   scheduling your family life. One of the biggest benefits that I love about our lifestyle is
[00:59:24.320 --> 00:59:29.520]   that it's easy for us to do family scheduling. The only schedule we have to work around is
[00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:34.480]   my work schedule. But beyond that, because the children are homeschooled, my wife is
[00:59:34.480 --> 00:59:41.400]   at home, it's easy for us to schedule. I guess I was too much there. We do have to
[00:59:41.400 --> 00:59:44.800]   deal with homeschool co-op a little bit with some of our commitments there, but those things
[00:59:44.800 --> 00:59:49.080]   are very light compared to the average scheduling constraint to the modern American family.
[00:59:49.080 --> 00:59:53.760]   So if we want to go somewhere, we just go. I pick a week and I go. I usually talk with
[00:59:53.760 --> 00:59:58.420]   my wife about it in advance, obviously, but we don't pick certain days based upon how
[00:59:58.420 --> 01:00:04.800]   much PTO she has from her job. We just go. And I pick the days based upon my work obligations.
[01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:10.360]   Even just all the other stuff. Husbands, you can have a far better sex life if you have
[01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:18.000]   a stay-at-home wife who has time, is relaxed, is energetic, has the ability to take a nap,
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:21.320]   has the ability to handle her responsibilities, isn't frustrated and stressed out about her
[01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:26.960]   boss yelling at her at work. So you have far better opportunities for a strong family life,
[01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:33.480]   for a more fulfilling personal life, and you have far better opportunities for career success
[01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:41.040]   and for big financial gains if you're freer to work on your career.
[01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:44.800]   Now I want to answer a couple of specific questions and give you some suggestions on
[01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:49.680]   practical steps of how do you achieve some of this lifestyle freedom. If this makes sense
[01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:54.080]   to you, if you see what I've experienced of lifestyle freedom, you may have the desire
[01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:57.880]   to do it. But then of course we're up against the financial constraints. So you think about
[01:00:57.880 --> 01:01:04.400]   what about working from home and home businesses? You know, and this is especially with a lot
[01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:10.560]   of moms. It's one of the reasons why many moms get involved in MLMs, they get involved
[01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:14.720]   in online things, blogging, you know, things like that. Because they're trying to figure
[01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:23.120]   out how do I stay financially productive while I'm at home? And that's not easy, right?
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:28.360]   First, there are lots of legitimate work from home things that can be done. They totally
[01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:34.800]   are. And I love working from home. I work from home, so you can too. It can be tough
[01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:39.440]   to build. It took me a lot of years to figure out how to do it, but it is possible. And
[01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:43.320]   I think that those things are really excellent opportunities, especially if there are no
[01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:48.000]   young children in the house. If you have the ability for anybody to get a job where you
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.880]   can work from home, some or all the time, or to have a business where you can work from
[01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:56.440]   home, I think it's well worth pursuing. One of the things that I observed growing up,
[01:01:56.440 --> 01:02:00.600]   my dad was a traditional engineer with a traditional office, but he often worked from home. And
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:04.480]   that gave him tremendous flexibility. This was in the days where it was just barely a
[01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:10.200]   thing. And so I think that's really, really great. I personally don't see how it's possible
[01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:14.600]   to hold down a great job or build a business and simultaneously care for young children.
[01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:18.440]   I know there are moms who do it. I know there are dads who do it. I don't know how it's
[01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:23.840]   possible. When I look at the tremendous time required and emotional energy, and I try to
[01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:28.960]   imagine myself as a stay-at-home dad with just my children to care for, and I try to
[01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:33.000]   imagine how I would do it, I couldn't do it with young children. I could do it with children
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.960]   who are old enough to sit at a desk and do their schoolwork with just minimal supervision.
[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:41.640]   That starts what, second, third grade probably. I could do it with children old enough to
[01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:46.220]   work in a family business. I couldn't do it with babies. And I think that that's a very
[01:02:46.220 --> 01:02:50.040]   difficult burden to put on your wife. If you expect her to be a good mother, don't try
[01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:56.760]   to make her be a good mother and a super businesswoman at the same time. Some people do it. I don't
[01:02:56.760 --> 01:03:02.600]   know how. I've never been able to figure out how. But if you can build a work-from-home
[01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:06.920]   business, I think that's fantastic. I think a family business can be even better, a family
[01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:11.560]   where everyone can be involved. Dad, mom, children is really, really worth building.
[01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:16.120]   And one of the benefits of having some kind of business like that is that it can be a
[01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:22.000]   good option both ways, for mom to be able to have some contact with adults, but also
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:25.720]   to still be available with children. One of the most difficult things that you've got
[01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:29.480]   to work for is it's very draining to be with young children all the day. Talk to a mom
[01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:33.200]   of young kids and she'll be grateful to be able to sit down and have coffee with an adult
[01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:37.320]   and be able to have the times. And so I think one of the biggest things that you should
[01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:42.400]   do as you're trying to lead your family is work to make that happen. Work to make it
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:48.320]   happen so that she has a break. And that can really be a big deal for her happiness, for
[01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:53.600]   her health, for her mental health, etc. So there are opportunities in working from home
[01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:57.960]   and home businesses, but I'm not going to do it too much. We'll talk a little bit in
[01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:03.120]   a section on entrepreneurship. I don't think it's necessary. I think that sometimes there's
[01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:07.420]   so many things of savings that can be done without them being as demanding as trying
[01:04:07.420 --> 01:04:11.800]   to work every day during the kid's nap time, that there's plenty of financial abilities
[01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:16.820]   for your wife to be financially productive. I personally don't ever want to be in a position
[01:04:16.820 --> 01:04:21.920]   where I had to force her and say, "You have to work from home." There are things I think
[01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:25.160]   that are better suited to the benefits of working from home. So what I would try to
[01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:29.920]   do if we needed, if I needed my wife to be more financially productive, but we wanted
[01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:35.280]   her to be able to be at home, I would try very hard to have her more in the vein of
[01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:41.680]   handling investments, renting out a home, managing our investment properties, handling
[01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:46.560]   Airbnb listings, something like that where the work is not, where you have to sit down
[01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:50.320]   for three solid hours every single day, where the work can be worked around in a few minutes
[01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:54.920]   here and there, just because I think that would be better for the home environment,
[01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:57.240]   for her ability to get the work done effectively.
[01:04:57.240 --> 01:05:05.080]   Now one of the big questions, especially that a lot of men face is, "What if your wife doesn't
[01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:10.800]   want to stay at home? What if she says, 'I find the home environment draining. I don't
[01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:16.200]   like it. I feel confined. I want to talk with adults. I want to build my career.' What do
[01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:21.800]   you do in that situation?" It's a really tough question. I personally feel like I dodged
[01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:29.760]   a bullet on this particular topic in choosing my wife. Prior to being married, prior to
[01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:33.160]   this experience, this particular thing we're talking about wasn't really all that important
[01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:36.760]   to me previously. I didn't think much about it. I was young, so you expect young people
[01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:40.600]   not to think too much about it, but I didn't think much about it. Several of the girls
[01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:45.380]   that I was interested in when I was younger, before my wife and I got together, had very
[01:05:45.380 --> 01:05:50.280]   significant career ambitions. Two of them are now doctors. I've often thought to myself,
[01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:55.880]   "What on earth would I do if I were married to a doctor?" You can imagine how difficult
[01:05:55.880 --> 01:06:04.160]   it is for those ladies. This has been their dream, both of the girls, my personal acquaintances.
[01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:09.880]   Their dream from the time they were little girls was to be a doctor. They invested years
[01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:17.360]   and years of blood, sweat, tears, and treasure into becoming a doctor, built these big careers,
[01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:22.640]   and earning lots of money. Imagine you're a woman in that situation. Let's say you go
[01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:26.800]   through college, get out of college at 22, go to medical school, get out of residency,
[01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:31.360]   and there you are in your late 20s. For the first time, you're finally able to earn some
[01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:35.160]   money. You start earning some money, but you know you want to have children. You've basically
[01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:40.480]   got a biological cap of 40 years old to have children, and yet you're finally starting
[01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:50.120]   to earn an income, finally, after years and decades of work. Are you going to walk away
[01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:56.540]   from that to be home with your children? Most can't. They just can't do that because of
[01:06:56.540 --> 01:07:01.200]   all the time that they have invested in it. Most aren't. I've often thought, "What if
[01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:05.600]   I were a husband in that situation? What would I do?" The problem is that as a husband, if
[01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:10.240]   you're a good husband, you want to support your wife in all of her ambitions and goals.
[01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:14.840]   You want her to have the richest, most fulfilling life that she can possibly imagine, and you
[01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:19.960]   want to lay down your life to help her do that. Today, one of the challenges is that
[01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:27.280]   many women have major career goals, major ambitions related to that. Here you are as
[01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:31.320]   a husband. You want to support your wife. You want her to live a rich and fulfilling
[01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:38.880]   life, and she's got these major career goals, but you also have family goals. You sit down
[01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:44.880]   and you say, "How do I make these things work?" Really, really tough. Really tough. I have
[01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:48.120]   often think, just the other night in preparing for the show, I was telling my wife, talking
[01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:51.360]   about the outline of what I was planning to talk about. We were talking about it, and
[01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:56.760]   I just said again, "I am so grateful that I never married those two girls that became
[01:07:56.760 --> 01:08:01.920]   doctors because I don't know what I would do, and it would really be difficult for me."
[01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:06.600]   Obviously, one of the simple things you can do is choose. One of the things that I have
[01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:15.000]   most come to value about my wife is that she never had big career ambitions. Her goal was
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:18.200]   not, "How can I get married as quickly as possible so that I can be a mom with children?"
[01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:23.120]   That wasn't her at all, but she just didn't have a lot of big career ambitions. For her,
[01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:31.000]   the cost of being a full-time wife and mom was not related to careers.
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:34.040]   I don't think if you're a husband, you're in this situation, I don't think you can force
[01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:40.680]   your wife into something. I think that's a recipe for disaster. It's disrespectful and
[01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:45.640]   really, really difficult in that situation. I hope that I've given some ideas that might
[01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:51.480]   possibly be able to persuade her, to help her to see something. One of the things that
[01:08:51.480 --> 01:08:56.940]   I have observed today is that many women just simply don't have a concept of what they could
[01:08:56.940 --> 01:09:01.180]   do in their family and personal life with time and flexibility. Same problem that both
[01:09:01.180 --> 01:09:05.840]   men and women face when thinking about retirement. They don't quite know what to do with it.
[01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:10.240]   If you talk to many women who've been raised with career ambitions as the first and foremost
[01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:13.480]   thing, "You go, girl. You got to build your career. You got to be independent." They have
[01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:20.280]   big career ambitions, but they don't have the ability to see what good they could do
[01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:24.680]   as a wife and a mother and what would be the benefit of that kind of lifestyle. They don't
[01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:28.400]   see all those things that I could talk about. They don't see how they could contribute to
[01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:34.320]   the family without just holding down a full-time job. Many women face this challenge. They
[01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:37.840]   want to contribute to the family and so they think, "I got to work and I got to earn an
[01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:42.080]   income." Yet, there's lots and lots of ways to contribute to a family that don't involve
[01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:48.600]   work outside the home and an income. I would try to talk about some of those things. I
[01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:53.960]   think that if you're in a situation like that, I think that there are some wives where if
[01:09:53.960 --> 01:10:01.520]   you showed them how meaningful their impact could be, they might love the opportunity
[01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:06.800]   to be a full-time wife, full-time mother. They might really appreciate that. If you
[01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:10.920]   can demonstrate that you would really value that, I think there are a lot of girls in
[01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:17.240]   the middle that would really go for that. Not all. Again, this show is never going to
[01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:22.000]   persuade somebody who's ideologically committed to, "Got to earn an income. Got to be independent.
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:25.560]   Got to make more than my husband," etc. But I think my experience has been that there
[01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:31.320]   are a lot of girls who would love the ability to have that more relaxed lifestyle, to invest
[01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:38.000]   into their home and their family and to making it awesome and beautiful and meaningful. I
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:41.320]   think that there are a lot of husbands, my experience, a lot of husbands who really love
[01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:46.200]   it. It makes them feel really good to be able to support their wife in that way.
[01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:51.840]   But if you can live a... So talk about it. Talk to your wife. At the end of the day,
[01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:57.400]   every single couple in these things has to decide what's best for them. And there's
[01:10:57.400 --> 01:11:04.140]   no place that any of us have to go into to dig into and try to control another couple.
[01:11:04.140 --> 01:11:07.660]   This is the most intimate relationship you can have. And I think it has to be worked
[01:11:07.660 --> 01:11:11.780]   out between a husband and wife. My goal is just simply to provide some ideas that can
[01:11:11.780 --> 01:11:20.020]   possibly show how much I've benefited by having a life arrangement in this particular way.
[01:11:20.020 --> 01:11:24.860]   What if you can live a great life and still both work? Well, I think you can. And I think
[01:11:24.860 --> 01:11:29.620]   that, especially if you don't have children, I think that obviously that's an opportunity.
[01:11:29.620 --> 01:11:34.300]   You take children out of the mix, and I still think there are benefits. I gave through that
[01:11:34.300 --> 01:11:39.160]   long list of benefits. But if you take children out of the mix, then I think you have the
[01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:44.160]   opportunity to both still work and to live a great life. What I would say is that what
[01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:49.500]   you should try to do there is streamline your life as much as possible and try to find some
[01:11:49.500 --> 01:11:55.580]   efficient ways to get some of those benefits. So for example, easier for you to live an
[01:11:55.580 --> 01:11:59.580]   efficient life if you live in a small apartment and still have time on the weekends. One of
[01:11:59.580 --> 01:12:03.100]   the things I didn't anticipate until I went through it was when my wife and I married,
[01:12:03.100 --> 01:12:06.900]   we lived in a little tiny studio apartment. So we had to clean the house. But we had one
[01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:12.740]   bathroom to clean, and we had the studio that we swept. So about 15 minutes, we could do
[01:12:12.740 --> 01:12:17.220]   the whole housework. I'd go and clean the bathroom. My wife would sweep, finish the
[01:12:17.220 --> 01:12:22.580]   dishes. Boom, we're done. And then we can go and do our things. So recognize that freedom
[01:12:22.580 --> 01:12:27.440]   can be achieved in many ways. So you can achieve personal freedom with things like living a
[01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:31.980]   minimalist lifestyle. So you don't have to have all those things tearing you down, those
[01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:38.420]   things holding you down and restricting your freedom. Those are choices. So nothing in
[01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:43.940]   this kind of analysis is either/or. There are many ways to achieve this kind of freedom.
[01:12:43.940 --> 01:12:50.940]   And so look for that. Now, I've thus far, I've generally used the term stay-at-home
[01:12:50.940 --> 01:12:55.660]   wife, and I've assumed that a husband would be the one generating an income and the wife
[01:12:55.660 --> 01:13:04.420]   would be at home. And in the modern world, this is a very scandalous assumption to make.
[01:13:04.420 --> 01:13:08.420]   When I conclude this show, if any listeners have gotten to this point, usually they just
[01:13:08.420 --> 01:13:12.460]   turn off and leave a review about Joshua's, you know, sexist, etc. But sometimes they
[01:13:12.460 --> 01:13:17.260]   write me an email and say, "You use just such total sexist language." I don't worry much
[01:13:17.260 --> 01:13:20.900]   about that. But I do want to answer the question, though, because there are a lot of listeners
[01:13:20.900 --> 01:13:27.020]   who are in a situation where their wife earns a much bigger income, has a much bigger career.
[01:13:27.020 --> 01:13:30.260]   And I've often thought, "Okay, what if I were married to one of those girls that became
[01:13:30.260 --> 01:13:35.900]   a doctor? What would I do? Would I be the stay-at-home husband?" I've thought a lot
[01:13:35.900 --> 01:13:44.300]   about that. And all I can do is say, is just say, "May God give you wisdom in your situation
[01:13:44.300 --> 01:13:50.260]   to do the very best things." My personality and temperament is such that in a lot of ways,
[01:13:50.260 --> 01:13:56.340]   I would love to be a full-time stay-at-home dad. Frankly, I am. I'm a full-time stay-at-home
[01:13:56.340 --> 01:14:03.020]   dad. I just also am running a business. So, I love the opportunity of doing things with
[01:14:03.020 --> 01:14:08.940]   children. I really love it. It is so fun to me to work on, you know, children's educational
[01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:13.100]   products and projects. So fun for me to think about, "Okay, where could we go this week
[01:14:13.100 --> 01:14:19.420]   and go to the museum and then the park and what could we do?" I think it's fun. I enjoy
[01:14:19.420 --> 01:14:23.580]   all of the domestic stuff. In my household, I do a lot of the cooking because I enjoy
[01:14:23.580 --> 01:14:27.820]   cooking. My wife doesn't enjoy cooking. And I think it's so fun to... I'm that guy who
[01:14:27.820 --> 01:14:34.180]   likes to learn a new recipe and make something new and whatnot. And so, I would thrive personally
[01:14:34.180 --> 01:14:41.260]   as a full-time stay-at-home dad. I'm unconvinced that that's the best solution for young children
[01:14:41.260 --> 01:14:44.980]   unless it's just clearly the solution that needs to be made. I really think that young
[01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:51.100]   children need mom. Dad is better than a daycare worker. So, if that's the only feasible financial
[01:14:51.100 --> 01:14:56.340]   solution or that's the only feasible solution based upon the unique peculiarities of a family,
[01:14:56.340 --> 01:15:02.500]   dad is better than a daycare worker. So, if we talked it through and we decided that,
[01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:09.660]   "No, this is... my wife's career is more important or due to these personal constraints or she's
[01:15:09.660 --> 01:15:17.180]   made these commitments or whatever the details are," I would do that. I would stop working
[01:15:17.180 --> 01:15:21.700]   and I would go and be with my children because I believe that I can make a far bigger impact
[01:15:21.700 --> 01:15:27.660]   with my family and with my children if I have the opportunity to build into them the way
[01:15:27.660 --> 01:15:32.940]   that I want to build into them than if I'm working in an office all the time. So, if
[01:15:32.940 --> 01:15:38.020]   it's a choice between mom or dad, I think mom is generally better. If it's a choice
[01:15:38.020 --> 01:15:44.180]   between dad or daycare worker, walk away from the money, take care of your children. You're
[01:15:44.180 --> 01:15:48.460]   going to really value that investment that you make in your children. So, may God give
[01:15:48.460 --> 01:15:52.900]   you wisdom in that situation. Now, to close, how do you make the transition? Let's say
[01:15:52.900 --> 01:15:57.060]   that you... something of what I've said has been appealing and you're like, "Yeah, Joshua
[01:15:57.060 --> 01:16:03.860]   actually would be nice. We would enjoy that family freedom in some way if we chose to
[01:16:03.860 --> 01:16:07.500]   do that." But yet, we really aren't sure about the financial planning. We're not... we're
[01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:11.740]   really not sure about how to do that. So, I'll give you just some suggestions. Number
[01:16:11.740 --> 01:16:18.660]   one, you've got to talk about it. Talk about it together and be honest with one another.
[01:16:18.660 --> 01:16:25.060]   My experience is a tremendous level of dishonesty about this subject in the world abroad. When
[01:16:25.060 --> 01:16:29.980]   I was in college, I never would have told a girl, "I want to stay at home wife," because
[01:16:29.980 --> 01:16:35.380]   I would have feared that I would be perceived as not with the times, not hip with the times,
[01:16:35.380 --> 01:16:40.100]   right? And that's a fear that a lot of people have. I think it's especially difficult on
[01:16:40.100 --> 01:16:46.100]   women because I think there are a lot of women who fear saying to somebody, "I want to be
[01:16:46.100 --> 01:16:49.860]   a stay-at-home mom. It would make me happy to be a stay-at-home mom and to care for you,
[01:16:49.860 --> 01:16:55.220]   my husband." That's not popular in today's world. That's a very difficult statement to
[01:16:55.220 --> 01:17:01.340]   make publicly. And so, because of those fears, I think people often suppress the desire and
[01:17:01.340 --> 01:17:06.980]   they often suppress the conversation about it. So, if I can do nothing other than potentially
[01:17:06.980 --> 01:17:11.380]   stimulate a conversation in your marriage about what you and your spouse would really
[01:17:11.380 --> 01:17:16.220]   like and how you would really like to live, I'm happy with that. But you've got to be
[01:17:16.220 --> 01:17:27.340]   honest. Honest for both sides. As a man, I love having a wife who's only concerned about
[01:17:27.340 --> 01:17:34.420]   me and our family. That is awesome. If I'm picky... My wife died and I had to choose
[01:17:34.420 --> 01:17:40.020]   a new wife. And I had the choice to choose between a woman who said, "Joshua, if you'll
[01:17:40.020 --> 01:17:44.140]   provide for me, if you'll meet my needs, if you'll love me, if you'll care for me and
[01:17:44.140 --> 01:17:51.060]   you'll be faithful for me, I'll just spend my time and energy focused on your well-being,
[01:17:51.060 --> 01:17:56.620]   on our family goals, on our family businesses, and we'll be totally joined in those goals
[01:17:56.620 --> 01:18:02.620]   and my goal is to support you." Versus, I'm choosing a woman who says, "Well, I love you
[01:18:02.620 --> 01:18:05.980]   and I want to be together with you and I want to be an equal partner, but I also want to
[01:18:05.980 --> 01:18:11.180]   build this independent career and go and serve an independent boss. I'll choose option one
[01:18:11.180 --> 01:18:16.700]   all the time." It is awesome to be a husband and to feel that way. And I believe it gives
[01:18:16.700 --> 01:18:23.620]   you a much greater loyalty in a relationship and a much greater sense of loyalty. You
[01:18:23.620 --> 01:18:30.860]   know, my wife has taken a tremendous personal risk to ally herself with me. When a woman
[01:18:30.860 --> 01:18:36.300]   walks away from a career, it's a tremendous personal risk, especially in the modern divorce
[01:18:36.300 --> 01:18:42.860]   culture because there are multiple costs associated with that. The first obvious cost is that,
[01:18:42.860 --> 01:18:47.100]   you know, my wife, when she stopped working, she lost a lot of her connections in the job
[01:18:47.100 --> 01:18:53.380]   force, etc. She loses her independent income, which is obviously a tremendous, you know,
[01:18:53.380 --> 01:18:57.060]   piece of vulnerability. Prior to that, she had income, she could do whatever she wanted
[01:18:57.060 --> 01:19:01.780]   with it. Well, now she's dependent on my income. That's a very vulnerable place for her to
[01:19:01.780 --> 01:19:07.460]   be in. In addition, that cost goes on down the road. So, for example, let's say that
[01:19:07.460 --> 01:19:14.460]   my wife works really hard, diligently raising our children, and then 20 years from now decides
[01:19:14.460 --> 01:19:18.980]   to go back in the workforce. The cost of her leaving the workforce has a financial cost
[01:19:18.980 --> 01:19:23.300]   for the rest of her life because it's unlikely that she'll enter the workforce at the same
[01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:28.020]   place as where a woman who stayed working in a career the whole time did. It's very
[01:19:28.020 --> 01:19:32.420]   unlikely. And so there's tremendous financial costs and it's a place of insecurity for a
[01:19:32.420 --> 01:19:40.180]   woman, which is one of the reasons why I'm very hardcore about men being responsible
[01:19:40.180 --> 01:19:44.660]   to provide for their wives and to care for their wives. I don't like, it's one of the
[01:19:44.660 --> 01:19:48.500]   reasons I don't like doing divorce planning. Not that there's not a place, there are women
[01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:52.500]   who take advantage of men, lots of them, but I believe that men have a responsibility to
[01:19:52.500 --> 01:19:58.420]   care for their wives and to provide for them for life. So there's a tremendous risk that
[01:19:58.420 --> 01:20:04.180]   your wife takes. Now, I think there are plenty of rewards that make more than make up for
[01:20:04.180 --> 01:20:12.980]   it. As a husband, I'm far more, I feel far more loving towards my wife, knowing that
[01:20:12.980 --> 01:20:18.180]   she's been willing to do that for me. And I think it makes our relationship far deeper
[01:20:18.180 --> 01:20:21.260]   than if she were competing with me and trying to say, "Well, I'm going to earn more than
[01:20:21.260 --> 01:20:25.740]   you are and we're going to have this separate things." If I didn't feel like my wife was
[01:20:25.740 --> 01:20:31.580]   fully invested in our place as a family, I'd feel like I was competing with her boss, her
[01:20:31.580 --> 01:20:36.460]   career, and that would make me feel less loving towards her and would diminish the bond that
[01:20:36.460 --> 01:20:41.900]   we have in our relationship. So it goes both ways. I guess my encouragement to you is to
[01:20:41.900 --> 01:20:46.500]   be honest. I'm doing my best to model that for you, speaking honestly from my experience,
[01:20:46.500 --> 01:20:51.700]   but my encouragement to you is to be honest. And then for women as well, if you have a
[01:20:51.700 --> 01:20:55.860]   desire to be a stay-at-home mom, be honest about it. And one of the things that I've
[01:20:55.860 --> 01:21:02.820]   observed over the years is I worked with a couple, a handful, a couple of clients where
[01:21:02.820 --> 01:21:07.660]   the man would say to me privately, "I need my wife to make more money. She's just not
[01:21:07.660 --> 01:21:13.620]   producing enough." And men didn't acknowledge the contributions of their wife in the household
[01:21:13.620 --> 01:21:18.900]   and they wanted their wife to produce more. And often that cultural sense, that fact that
[01:21:18.900 --> 01:21:22.540]   many women, many wives don't see a way to contribute to their household or to their
[01:21:22.540 --> 01:21:26.860]   marriages unless they're earning an income. Often they're just short-sighted, they haven't
[01:21:26.860 --> 01:21:30.420]   had it modeled. You know, dad and mom both went to work every day and so the way that
[01:21:30.420 --> 01:21:35.020]   you contribute is you go to work every day. This is a different experience. But if you
[01:21:35.020 --> 01:21:40.580]   want something different, be honest and talk about it. It sounds dumb, I mean it just sounds
[01:21:40.580 --> 01:21:47.860]   simple, but that's the key is I think starting with being honest and talking about it. In
[01:21:47.860 --> 01:21:51.500]   addition, I hope I've given you a few ideas to see how if you're a woman who wants to
[01:21:51.500 --> 01:21:56.820]   be a stay-at-home wife, you've got an opportunity to really contribute to your household. And
[01:21:56.820 --> 01:22:03.500]   you've got a really important job. The ability, again, the family life that most people have
[01:22:03.500 --> 01:22:07.740]   experienced, latchkey children and whatnot, you know, our parents' generation invented
[01:22:07.740 --> 01:22:13.020]   this idea of quality time. I think quality time is a complete farce. I think it's utterly
[01:22:13.020 --> 01:22:18.100]   stupid. And I think that it was invented by our parents who were going into the dual income
[01:22:18.100 --> 01:22:22.260]   kind of career world and they were trying to figure out a way to absolve their consciences
[01:22:22.260 --> 01:22:25.300]   of their guilt of the fact that they weren't seeing their children. They institutionalized
[01:22:25.300 --> 01:22:28.100]   their children and they weren't going to see them. And so they came up with this idea,
[01:22:28.100 --> 01:22:31.900]   "Well, I don't have quantity time with my children, but I have quality time." I think
[01:22:31.900 --> 01:22:36.020]   it's total bunk. My experience as a father, there's no such thing as quality time. The
[01:22:36.020 --> 01:22:42.780]   most important conversations always come at the weirdest times. You know, you're strapping
[01:22:42.780 --> 01:22:46.220]   your child into a car seat, you're late for a dinner appointment, and all of a sudden
[01:22:46.220 --> 01:22:52.420]   your child's staring at the sky and, you know, the Twitter joke. Last night, my two-year-old
[01:22:52.420 --> 01:22:56.060]   said, "Daddy, what is the meaning of life?" Well, that's the kind of stuff that happens
[01:22:56.060 --> 01:23:00.300]   all the time as a parent. You know, your child will express some deep-seated fear at the
[01:23:00.300 --> 01:23:04.500]   weirdest time. And yet, if you're not there, you don't get those chances. You don't get
[01:23:04.500 --> 01:23:08.940]   those opportunities. They'll ask a question that turns out to be a really important question,
[01:23:08.940 --> 01:23:13.980]   but if you're not there, you don't get those opportunities. Years ago, I listened to a
[01:23:13.980 --> 01:23:19.280]   Brian Tracy seminar on parenting and he said, "It's quality of time at work that counts
[01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:24.260]   and quantity of time at home." And I've always grabbed onto that. It's like, that's good.
[01:23:24.260 --> 01:23:29.340]   That's true. At work, I can be efficient and productive. And at work, I can multitask and
[01:23:29.340 --> 01:23:33.860]   I can hire things done. It's quality of time at work that makes a difference, but it's
[01:23:33.860 --> 01:23:39.660]   quantity of time at home that makes the difference. But because many of us haven't had much of
[01:23:39.660 --> 01:23:45.100]   an example of what a pleasant home environment was like, of what it was like to have a place
[01:23:45.100 --> 01:23:48.060]   where everyone wanted to be and everyone wanted to be together because relationships were
[01:23:48.060 --> 01:23:52.740]   fractured and stress and tension and fights were all around the place. We didn't see that,
[01:23:52.740 --> 01:23:57.220]   but that doesn't have to be you. If you're a woman and you're in that situation, you
[01:23:57.220 --> 01:24:02.180]   can learn how to build those things. You can learn how to build a house that your family
[01:24:02.180 --> 01:24:06.740]   wants to be in. You can learn how to build relationships of peace and harmony among your
[01:24:06.740 --> 01:24:12.620]   children. And if it costs you money in your career, I think you'll get benefits from it
[01:24:12.620 --> 01:24:19.900]   down the road. If not in financial support, at least in love and in rich relationships.
[01:24:19.900 --> 01:24:26.060]   It's very difficult for a family where everyone is institutionalized. Dad works in his institution.
[01:24:26.060 --> 01:24:30.100]   Mom works in her institution. Children are in their institutions and they're together
[01:24:30.100 --> 01:24:35.260]   for a short period of time out of convenience. It's very difficult for that family to all
[01:24:35.260 --> 01:24:40.660]   of a sudden magically 30 years later, build some kind of close family culture. What'll
[01:24:40.660 --> 01:24:45.860]   happen is dad will be institutionalized in the nursing home. Mom will be institutionalized
[01:24:45.860 --> 01:24:50.420]   in the nursing home and the children will be institutionalized in their jobs while they
[01:24:50.420 --> 01:24:54.540]   institutionalize the grandchildren and something else. So if you want a different family culture
[01:24:54.540 --> 01:24:59.540]   when you're 80, you're going to have to work differently at it when you're 30. At least
[01:24:59.540 --> 01:25:03.980]   that's what I see. Now, if you talk about it and you decide, you know what, in our family
[01:25:03.980 --> 01:25:09.060]   we would like to have a stay at home parent. We would like mom or dad to stay at home.
[01:25:09.060 --> 01:25:11.540]   If you're going to, how are we going to do it? Well, my answer is if you're going to
[01:25:11.540 --> 01:25:19.760]   do it, just decide and do it. I'm convinced that this is far more of a personal ideological
[01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:27.600]   decision based upon something that you see and that you want than it is a planning decision.
[01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:31.860]   You may not be able to afford it where you are right now. So you do need to look at the
[01:25:31.860 --> 01:25:37.100]   numbers, but if you're going to do it, just make the necessary changes to do it. I'm at
[01:25:37.100 --> 01:25:43.820]   this point ideologically committed to this lifestyle. So it's not a matter of technical
[01:25:43.820 --> 01:25:50.200]   question, et cetera. I would give up on $2 million of extra wealth at retirement in order
[01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:54.980]   to live this lifestyle. Maybe I have, I don't know. I don't think so because I'd still believe
[01:25:54.980 --> 01:25:58.660]   that I have much more opportunities to be financially productive because I have a stay
[01:25:58.660 --> 01:26:02.900]   at home wife. But if you said, Joshua, the cost is for you to have $2 million less at
[01:26:02.900 --> 01:26:07.040]   retirement age, but you can have all these benefits that you're experiencing with a stay
[01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:11.660]   at home wife and a strong family culture, et cetera, I would do it. If I had to move
[01:26:11.660 --> 01:26:16.540]   to a cheaper place, I would do it. If I had to move out of a fancy neighborhood into a
[01:26:16.540 --> 01:26:23.420]   cheap neighborhood to afford it or move from an expensive city to a rural town where there's
[01:26:23.420 --> 01:26:28.580]   far fewer opportunities for me to earn a lot of money, I would do it because I'm ideologically
[01:26:28.580 --> 01:26:35.300]   committed. It's a presupposition. It's a pre-commitment to the money. Now you may not be there, obviously.
[01:26:35.300 --> 01:26:38.900]   So what you need to do is look at the numbers and think about what would I be willing to
[01:26:38.900 --> 01:26:45.900]   do to make this happen? If you see it as important, you will figure out a way to do it. Now only
[01:26:45.900 --> 01:26:52.260]   a few people though are going to be in a situation where it would be a really big financial cost.
[01:26:52.260 --> 01:27:00.260]   Most couples aren't making $400,000 a year each of them. Most couples have at least one
[01:27:00.260 --> 01:27:04.460]   income in the house that's far more modest. And when you calculate the cost of working,
[01:27:04.460 --> 01:27:08.540]   as I've talked about in separate shows, and you calculate the opportunities for more financial
[01:27:08.540 --> 01:27:16.300]   efficiency through this type of lifestyle, I think you have more opportunities. If you
[01:27:16.300 --> 01:27:23.060]   want it, you can figure out a way to do it. Remember that not working in a job doesn't
[01:27:23.060 --> 01:27:30.220]   mean that you have to be non-productive. It's kind of interesting. I, for a long time in
[01:27:30.220 --> 01:27:36.380]   the financial independence or the retirement space, the FIRE movement, I have stated the
[01:27:36.380 --> 01:27:41.420]   position publicly that I'm not a fan of the FIRE movement because to me it's just too
[01:27:41.420 --> 01:27:46.260]   much of a focus on unproductivity and kind of indolence and laziness. This idea that
[01:27:46.260 --> 01:27:51.060]   while I was working, now I'm just going to sit back and engage in doing nothing. And
[01:27:51.060 --> 01:27:55.660]   I don't see the point. I think you should be productive for health and for impact and
[01:27:55.660 --> 01:28:01.380]   for meaning in life. You should be productive. So many people have said, "Joshua, you're
[01:28:01.380 --> 01:28:05.340]   wrong. I'm pursuing financial independence because... but I'm not going to be unproductive.
[01:28:05.340 --> 01:28:10.780]   I've got all these things I want to do." But ironically, when I talk about the value of
[01:28:10.780 --> 01:28:15.460]   having a stay-at-home wife, when I talk about that, people often just assume it's a place
[01:28:15.460 --> 01:28:19.620]   of unproductivity and they can't imagine how that's a better thing for her and how she
[01:28:19.620 --> 01:28:24.300]   can still be productive. So don't do that. If you're going to look at ways that you can
[01:28:24.300 --> 01:28:30.500]   be productive. And productivity is not exclusively related to children. Again, community involvement
[01:28:30.500 --> 01:28:36.220]   and things like that. Many moms have made a massive difference in community projects,
[01:28:36.220 --> 01:28:39.940]   etc. because they had the time and the energy to devote to those things because they weren't
[01:28:39.940 --> 01:28:47.580]   working for a paycheck all the time. So look at the costs, but just look at how you can
[01:28:47.580 --> 01:28:53.660]   make up the value on the back end. Practical tip. If you're getting married or newly married
[01:28:53.660 --> 01:28:58.260]   or you're trying to make this work just as a transition period, just commit to living
[01:28:58.260 --> 01:29:02.580]   on one income. Ideally, commit to living on one income from the very start. It's one of
[01:29:02.580 --> 01:29:06.020]   the things that my wife and I did do well, is we just, from the very beginning, we put
[01:29:06.020 --> 01:29:10.580]   her income in a separate bank account and we saved all of it. So if you already know
[01:29:10.580 --> 01:29:16.100]   that you can live as a family on one income, do it. And it'll make your decision a lot
[01:29:16.100 --> 01:29:19.220]   easier. So if you're trying to figure out, well, how do we make this transition? Maybe
[01:29:19.220 --> 01:29:23.980]   for six months from now, our goal is to make a transition six months from now. Well, commit
[01:29:23.980 --> 01:29:27.940]   to living on one income and start to learn the skills now. Just like when you're starting
[01:29:27.940 --> 01:29:31.940]   a business, you do the same kind of chicken entrepreneurship. Just do it. Live on one
[01:29:31.940 --> 01:29:42.780]   income from the very start. My closing statement. I have often wondered if the dual income lifestyle
[01:29:42.780 --> 01:29:52.220]   is a giant conspiracy. As far as I can tell, the only people who benefit from the modern
[01:29:52.220 --> 01:30:01.980]   dual income household are tax collectors and government agents. Because what happens is,
[01:30:01.980 --> 01:30:07.620]   in the modern dual income household, you have a far higher level of tax collection. Instead
[01:30:07.620 --> 01:30:13.340]   of a mom doing all these things within her own household, growing food to support her
[01:30:13.340 --> 01:30:21.420]   family, cooking meals at home, caring for children, educating children, etc. What happens
[01:30:21.420 --> 01:30:26.940]   is that mom goes to work. And so that immediately creates employment taxes and income taxes
[01:30:26.940 --> 01:30:32.300]   for the government based upon her work there. Then she has to use after tax dollars to pay
[01:30:32.300 --> 01:30:36.940]   for all those things. So then that goes in and instead of cooking a meal at home, we
[01:30:36.940 --> 01:30:43.140]   pay for food in a restaurant. Instead of growing money, growing a garden, then now we pay for
[01:30:43.140 --> 01:30:47.580]   food out. And so that creates sales taxes. And it creates more income taxes. Because
[01:30:47.580 --> 01:30:52.820]   instead of neighbors trading among neighbors, and maybe your wife grows green beans and
[01:30:52.820 --> 01:30:57.020]   the old guy next door grows tomatoes and they trade back and forth with a tax free barter
[01:30:57.020 --> 01:31:01.060]   exchange, now all of a sudden everything goes through the financial system. It creates more
[01:31:01.060 --> 01:31:06.660]   and more value, more and more tax revenue. And then when children are institutionalized,
[01:31:06.660 --> 01:31:10.180]   then they're automatically taught groupthink. They're automatically taught to all think
[01:31:10.180 --> 01:31:14.380]   the same way, to respond the same way, to stimulate. They're all taught to believe the
[01:31:14.380 --> 01:31:18.420]   same things. These are the doctrines that you need to know. And their love of learning
[01:31:18.420 --> 01:31:24.060]   is beaten out of them. And they basically are created into robots who easily move into
[01:31:24.060 --> 01:31:30.460]   factory jobs. So the children become much more easily governable, much more easily managed
[01:31:30.460 --> 01:31:36.100]   in a managerial society. They have far less of an ability to be a free thinker, to make
[01:31:36.100 --> 01:31:40.580]   decisions for themselves, to think creatively about their situations. And you create a much
[01:31:40.580 --> 01:31:45.820]   more easily governed society. I guess the third person that benefits, I forgot, so you
[01:31:45.820 --> 01:31:49.740]   got tax collectors and government agents who run a society. And then the third person that
[01:31:49.740 --> 01:31:54.820]   benefits would be corporate employers. That basically automatically, prior to the revolution
[01:31:54.820 --> 01:32:00.420]   into dual income households, in general you could have a dad who would earn enough money
[01:32:00.420 --> 01:32:05.300]   to support his family with his wife at home. Well, what do you do if you automatically
[01:32:05.300 --> 01:32:10.180]   double the supply of workers, where both mom and dad now are part of the workforce? Basically
[01:32:10.180 --> 01:32:16.620]   what you do is you halve the cost of labor. And so now the corporate business owners and
[01:32:16.620 --> 01:32:23.700]   corporate titans have basically halved the cost of labor. And so you have this society
[01:32:23.700 --> 01:32:28.380]   where the people who don't benefit are the dad and the mom and the children. They don't
[01:32:28.380 --> 01:32:34.940]   benefit really in any way, except this kind of ethereal, mystical sense of independence
[01:32:34.940 --> 01:32:41.500]   and financial independence and you go girl and be an independent woman and et cetera.
[01:32:41.500 --> 01:32:45.520]   Feel free to take that if you want it. I don't see it. So I've often wondered, is this whole
[01:32:45.520 --> 01:32:52.540]   thing just some giant conspiracy? Now, I don't actually believe it's a giant conspiracy,
[01:32:52.540 --> 01:32:56.660]   but it would not surprise me in an instant if you told me it was and you presented some
[01:32:56.660 --> 01:33:02.420]   kind of compelling proof. Either way, you can look at the results of it and say, "This
[01:33:02.420 --> 01:33:12.380]   lifestyle really stinks. It's no fun." And yet, you don't have to live it.
[01:33:12.380 --> 01:33:16.220]   One of the most impactful books I've read in the last few years was Anthony Esalen's
[01:33:16.220 --> 01:33:20.140]   book Out of the Ashes. If you haven't read it, I commend it to you. But in his first
[01:33:20.140 --> 01:33:26.180]   chapter he talks about the rubble. He talks about the rubble that is our modern society.
[01:33:26.180 --> 01:33:29.900]   I read you an extensive passage of it in a previous episode. If you haven't gotten it,
[01:33:29.900 --> 01:33:36.580]   read it. Read Out of the Ashes. And one of the things that he says on page 10 of chapter
[01:33:36.580 --> 01:33:46.780]   1 called The Rubble, he says, "We are incompetent in the ordinary things of life." We're incompetent
[01:33:46.780 --> 01:33:54.180]   in the ordinary things of life. And he starts to list a number of examples. And later in
[01:33:54.180 --> 01:33:59.460]   the paragraph he says, "We're in debt over the eyeballs. We cannot make ends meet, even
[01:33:59.460 --> 01:34:06.220]   on two incomes. And yet we hug ourselves for being liberated, looking with pity on a grandmother
[01:34:06.220 --> 01:34:11.820]   who in a single day did 50 skillful things for people she loved, rather than spending
[01:34:11.820 --> 01:34:17.740]   eight hours fielding phone calls in an office or scraping plaque off the teeth of strangers
[01:34:17.740 --> 01:34:22.420]   while wearing goggles and a face mask to guard against dreadful infections from their blood
[01:34:22.420 --> 01:34:29.100]   and spittle." And he says, "Every single pagan philosopher of the ancient world said
[01:34:29.100 --> 01:34:33.820]   that if you wanted to be free, you had to learn the hard ways of virtue, and that the
[01:34:33.820 --> 01:34:38.780]   worst form of slavery was slavery to your own appetites. That is what the founders of
[01:34:38.780 --> 01:34:43.140]   the United States also believed. That is what Christian preachers used to preach. That is
[01:34:43.140 --> 01:34:48.260]   what we have repudiated or forgotten, so that now we look to a massive central government
[01:34:48.260 --> 01:34:53.580]   for everything." Goes on and gives examples of that. And then he closes with this paragraph,
[01:34:53.580 --> 01:35:00.940]   "So we need to clear out the garbage, admit our errors, and rebuild. That requires humility,
[01:35:00.940 --> 01:35:07.500]   patience, and determination. But nothing else will do. When your only choices are repentance
[01:35:07.500 --> 01:35:12.380]   or oblivion, you repent." It is time to get to work, and that is what this book is about.
[01:35:12.380 --> 01:35:19.100]   Now, it's a great book, and he talks through some ways to do that. What I'm saying is,
[01:35:19.100 --> 01:35:23.300]   if you desire more freedom in your life, there are things that you can do short of being
[01:35:23.300 --> 01:35:30.300]   financially independent. I began this show with talking about spiritual liberty. If you
[01:35:30.300 --> 01:35:40.500]   are spiritually free and in a place of spiritual liberty, you have more freedom than you need.
[01:35:40.500 --> 01:35:45.420]   But now the next thing is some lifestyle decisions that you can make. What I have found, which
[01:35:45.420 --> 01:35:49.380]   was surprising to me because I didn't set out with this idea, but what I have found
[01:35:49.380 --> 01:35:55.900]   is that having my wife be home without the concern to try to figure out how to create
[01:35:55.900 --> 01:36:04.420]   an income has been one of the best lifestyle decisions that I could possibly make. I'm
[01:36:04.420 --> 01:36:14.620]   happier for it, she's happier for it, our children are happier for it. Consider if you,
[01:36:14.620 --> 01:36:21.660]   your spouse, and your family might be happier for it. I consider it an absolute benchmark
[01:36:21.660 --> 01:36:29.220]   of freedom and something that we don't want to give up. I hope you'll consider it. Now,
[01:36:29.220 --> 01:36:32.660]   stay with me in this series. I've got a number of other things. Some of them you'll expect,
[01:36:32.660 --> 01:36:35.780]   some of them you won't expect. We're going to talk more about financial freedom. We're
[01:36:35.780 --> 01:36:39.180]   going to talk about freedom from the state. I'm going to give you some really practical
[01:36:39.180 --> 01:36:45.220]   stuff. But these are, I think, things that anybody can do. Anybody can become spiritually
[01:36:45.220 --> 01:36:52.380]   free. Anybody who wants to can have a stay-at-home wife. All of these are achievable and all
[01:36:52.380 --> 01:36:55.820]   of them will help you in your freedom. Thank you so much for listening. I appreciate your
[01:36:55.820 --> 01:36:59.460]   help. If you need any personal help, feel free to reach out to me in a couple of ways.
[01:36:59.460 --> 01:37:04.460]   First of all, I sell a number of courses, including some courses on, I guess the most
[01:37:04.460 --> 01:37:07.620]   impactful one today would be the one that I have called "How to Borrow Money Safely
[01:37:07.620 --> 01:37:11.060]   and Never Pay Interest Using Credit Cards." We'll talk more about that in a show that
[01:37:11.060 --> 01:37:16.500]   I'll do on financial liberty. We'll talk about being debt free and having money, etc.
[01:37:16.500 --> 01:37:20.500]   But for now, feel free to check out my courses. You can go and find those at radicalpersonalfinance.com/store.
[01:37:20.500 --> 01:37:27.660]   I guess, let me plug the other more relevant one. I wasn't prepared with my ad copy. Big
[01:37:27.660 --> 01:37:34.000]   relevant one is career, my career and income planning course. One of the major reasons
[01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:39.280]   why many men can't support a stay-at-home wife is simply because they've never bothered
[01:37:39.280 --> 01:37:44.060]   to figure out how to try. They've never sat down and said, "This is expected of me, so
[01:37:44.060 --> 01:37:47.460]   I've got to build a career that actually makes money." Rather, they've just kind of randomly
[01:37:47.460 --> 01:37:53.860]   bounced into whatever random job that they're in. If that's you, stop. Figure out how to
[01:37:53.860 --> 01:37:59.620]   build a high-income career. Because although you can support a wife and family on $50,000
[01:37:59.620 --> 01:38:04.580]   a year, you can do it. And if I had to, I would do it. I'll tell you, it's a whole lot
[01:38:04.580 --> 01:38:11.840]   nicer to do it on $150,000 a year. It's just a lot better. It's better for you, better
[01:38:11.840 --> 01:38:18.060]   for your wife, etc. So sit down, be an adult, grow up and make a career plan. Go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/store
[01:38:18.060 --> 01:38:20.780]   and see if my course can help you with that. Thank you for listening. Be back with you
[01:38:20.780 --> 01:38:21.060]   soon.
