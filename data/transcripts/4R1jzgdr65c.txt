[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.600]   - Welcome back to the podcast and happy 2/22,
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.200]   today on this Wednesday.
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.200]   And that means that 2/22/22 is coming up later in the month
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.520]   and that date 2/22/22 happens to land
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.320]   on a Tuesday of all things.
[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.320]   Speaking of dates, nearly 30 years ago,
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.400]   Pastor John delivered a lecture series
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.960]   on biblical manhood and womanhood.
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.080]   The relevance of the series
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.240]   you are about to hear for yourself.
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.720]   It was 1993, he was speaking to college students
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.280]   in Dayton, Tennessee.
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.680]   I only recently listened to the series
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.480]   and today we are gonna feature a clip from part four of it
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.320]   brought to our attention by a couple named David
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.440]   and Katerina who listened to APJ in Germany.
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.480]   Katerina wrote in to say this,
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.840]   "The other week, my husband and I celebrated
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.040]   our second wedding anniversary."
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.920]   Congratulations to you both.
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.900]   "And we went away for a weekend to refocus,
[00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.360]   reflecting on the year past and planning for the year ahead
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.160]   and we wanted to listen to a sermon series
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.560]   to give us something to think about and ponder.
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.020]   And this time we picked Pastor John's lecture series
[00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.920]   called Manhood, Womanhood and God,
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.000]   a series from 1993, almost three decades ago."
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.760]   Well, thank you.
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.640]   For the prompt, Katerina drew our attention to part four,
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.360]   especially which is titled,
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.560]   "Lovers of Truth in a Politically Correct
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.860]   and Gender Leveling World."
[00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.600]   She sent this clip on political correctness
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.880]   where Pastor John gives examples of slogans in his day
[00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.000]   back in '93, Orwellian slogans
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.860]   used to sort of bias interpretation.
[00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.640]   The following audio is, it's not perfect.
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.800]   We worked with it a little bit,
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.400]   but the point is very relevant.
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.640]   It's worth a listen.
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.020]   Here's Pastor John in 1993.
[00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.080]   - Let me read you a text from the teachings of Jesus
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.260]   that is a clarion call to you this morning
[00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.700]   to be courageous in speaking unpopular things.
[00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.060]   This comes from Matthew 10, starting in verse 24.
[00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.740]   "A disciple is not above his teacher,
[00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.160]   nor a servant above his master.
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.420]   It is enough for the disciple to be like his teacher
[00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.700]   and the servant like his master.
[00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.600]   If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul,
[00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.720]   how much more will they malign those
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.760]   who are of his household?"
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.060]   In other words, expect to be maligned in the world.
[00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.240]   Don't assume that when you are called a name,
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.000]   you've suddenly made a big mistake
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.560]   and have said something inappropriate.
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.840]   Oh, I must go back and find another way to say it
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.480]   so they won't malign me.
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.500]   It says you're gonna be maligned.
[00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.280]   They spit on him.
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.280]   They crowned him with thorns.
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.880]   They called him names.
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.440]   They laughed him to scorn.
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.040]   Shall we be above our teacher?
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.840]   That's the point here.
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.760]   So have no fear of them,
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.440]   for nothing is covered that will not be revealed
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.080]   or hidden that will not be known.
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.360]   What I tell you in the dark, utter in the light.
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.880]   What you hear whispered, proclaim on the housetops.
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.460]   Do not fear those who kill the body,
[00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.800]   but cannot kill the soul.
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.800]   Rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.060]   Are not two sparrows sold for a penny?
[00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.280]   Not one of them will fall to the ground
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.400]   without your father's will,
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.920]   but even the hairs of your head are all numbered.
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.880]   Fear not, therefore, you are of more value
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.000]   than many sparrows.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.920]   Now, the point of that text is unmistakably clear
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.400]   because of the threefold repetition of the command.
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.240]   Verse 26, have no fear of them.
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.720]   Verse 28, do not fear those who kill the body.
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.860]   Verse 31, do not fear, therefore,
[00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.640]   you are of more value than many sparrows.
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.200]   Jesus does not want any of you to be afraid.
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.620]   And the issue about fear here
[00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.240]   is what comes out of your mouth.
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.360]   He is asking you to speak clearly, that is in the light,
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.460]   and forthrightly and publicly,
[00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.120]   that is on the housetops,
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.920]   things that will get you killed.
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.680]   Before your life is over,
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.220]   it is in all likelihood that you will be in jail
[00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.880]   for saying some of the things that I've said in this room
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.400]   in these past two days.
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.840]   Or if not in jail,
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.840]   you will be the victim of random violence
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.360]   from certain communities in society.
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.160]   One of our pastors was shot at
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.860]   on the way home from church last Sunday night.
[00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.940]   Just random, out of the towers
[00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.140]   across the street from the church,
[00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:53.260]   I heard the bullet go zing
[00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.060]   and hit the ground beside him.
[00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.780]   Now, we have no idea what was this.
[00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:58.880]   Why is this person doing this?
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.080]   Was it intentional?
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.380]   At least don't have anything to say about it.
[00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.380]   But I don't, that doesn't surprise me at all.
[00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.580]   Our church is known for a few controversial things.
[00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.940]   There are people who live in those towers
[00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:14.720]   who don't like what we say.
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.200]   Guns are easily available.
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.560]   Some of them are not mentally stable.
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.640]   Now, if you decide,
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.400]   oh, I'm not gonna live in a place like that.
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.740]   No way, whoa.
[00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:23.580]   What are you?
[00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.880]   Who's your master?
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.280]   What is this?
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.300]   Are you American or are you Christian?
[00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.860]   Do you choose your house for safety
[00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.860]   or do you choose your house for ministry?
[00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.900]   Jesus is real clear here.
[00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.860]   Be courageous, be fearless.
[00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.420]   So I want you to be unafraid this morning
[00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:48.260]   in spite of what it's gonna cost you
[00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.460]   to say things that are unpopular or dangerous.
[00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.020]   Now, in order to do that,
[00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:58.360]   you need to really exploit your time here at Bryan
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.860]   to become strong in the truth and strong in the word.
[00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.260]   Don't be children in your thinking.
[00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.700]   Be babes in evil in your thinking.
[00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.980]   Be mature, Paul says elsewhere.
[00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:14.900]   He wants you to use this time here at Bryan
[00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:19.140]   to grow more and more mature in your thinking,
[00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:21.500]   to send your roots deeper and deeper
[00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.620]   into the objective evidences of God's truth
[00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:26.200]   so that when you walk out of this place
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:29.060]   and scatter all over the nation and around the world,
[00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:31.380]   you go with a profound conviction
[00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:32.980]   about a few things in the world.
[00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:35.880]   You will always see through a glass darkly.
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.940]   You will never be totally comprehensive
[00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:40.020]   and have all the knowledge that God has,
[00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:41.480]   but there are a few things
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.940]   that you will know.
[00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:46.060]   Let me give you some examples now
[00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:47.760]   of the kind of thing I think you need
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.400]   to be really shrewd about.
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.820]   I call this talk "Lovers of Truth
[00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:55.780]   in a Politically Correct World
[00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:57.900]   and a Gender-Leveling World"
[00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:59.780]   because as I've lived now in Minneapolis
[00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:00.940]   in these past couple of years,
[00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:05.340]   watching the way language is so manipulated
[00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:07.220]   by politically correct people
[00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:10.820]   to get their ideas into students' minds
[00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:13.460]   by circumventing reasoned argument
[00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:15.540]   and using clever language.
[00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:17.540]   Just a few examples.
[00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:21.220]   My son goes to high school in Minneapolis
[00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:23.800]   and I go down there sometimes to see him
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.380]   or to do whatever,
[00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:27.500]   and I went down a year ago
[00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:29.620]   and saw two posters.
[00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:33.740]   They were over every doorway
[00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:36.400]   that were leading to the stairwells.
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.820]   So every student had to pass under these posters.
[00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:41.100]   They were school-sanctioned posters
[00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:43.500]   and they were politically correct
[00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:45.260]   and they were gender-leveling
[00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.380]   and homosexuality-endorsing.
[00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:50.940]   But the way they did it
[00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:55.800]   were oblique and remarkably shrewd
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:56.960]   and clever,
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:00.460]   the kind of thing that students by and large
[00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:02.020]   in the ninth through the twelfth grade
[00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:04.140]   have not been trained to discern
[00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:08.040]   and spot and unpack and make distinctions.
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:09.700]   That's why you're here,
[00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:11.700]   to learn to do that.
[00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:13.100]   Here was one of them.
[00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:14.460]   Big, beautiful poster,
[00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:17.140]   color rainbow kind of decoration.
[00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:22.140]   Quote, "One in 10 people are gay, lesbian, or bisexual.
[00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:29.540]   "They could be your brother, sister, parent, or friend."
[00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:31.340]   That's all the poster said.
[00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:33.780]   Sad.
[00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:35.820]   What's that message?
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:38.640]   It's crafted in such a way
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.720]   so that if a parent went into a principal
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:41.560]   and said, "I don't like that,"
[00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:44.200]   he'd say, "Well, what don't you like about it?
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.680]   "It doesn't teach anything."
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:49.720]   Well, there's several problems
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.680]   with that simple little quote.
[00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:55.600]   Number one, the statistic is inflated.
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.840]   10%.
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:58.680]   What's the point of that?
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.280]   The point is to create a feeling in these students,
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:05.380]   my God, every 10th person in the hall is gay.
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:09.840]   And that is the feeling they wanna create.
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.840]   Because once you feel that,
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:12.680]   you have to say,
[00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:16.160]   "It just can't be as bad as I feel it is.
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.020]   "Something must be wrong with me."
[00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:22.120]   That's the thought.
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:23.080]   Now, it's inflated.
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:25.840]   The numbers aren't 10%.
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:26.660]   No?
[00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:28.840]   The National Center for Health Statistics say three.
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:31.360]   William Simon and the Kinsey Institute say two to three.
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:36.020]   The Chicago study recently says 1%, maybe.
[00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:37.820]   Nobody knows for sure.
[00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:40.740]   10% was one of those inflated figures.
[00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:42.980]   Then here's the second thing wrong with it.
[00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:46.780]   There was no moral assessment of the behavior.
[00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:48.620]   It's an emotional appeal.
[00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:53.620]   Your parent might be gay or bisexual.
[00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:57.220]   Now, when that thought enters a ninth grader's mind,
[00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:01.140]   my daddy might be a bisexual.
[00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:03.360]   What's he supposed to do with that?
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:06.040]   No teaching, no standards,
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:08.740]   just the thought sewn in the kid's brain.
[00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:14.100]   I'll tell you what happens is that he might say,
[00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:15.680]   "Oh, it just can't be."
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.320]   But if it keeps coming back,
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:20.720]   he'll say, "Well, if it were, he's okay,
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:23.280]   "and it must be okay."
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:28.400]   And so you reduce the whole moral dimension
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:33.400]   of something being right or wrong.
[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:38.360]   This is politically correct manipulation of language
[00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:40.800]   to put ideas into minds
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:44.440]   by short-circuiting clear, critical thinking.
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:47.820]   And it happens in every newspaper almost every day
[00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:50.580]   and on almost every television advertisement
[00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:54.520]   and virtually all kinds of media efforts.
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:56.200]   Here's the other poster.
[00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:59.640]   It was even more tricky, shorter.
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:05.720]   The poster said, "Respect sees no color,
[00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:11.340]   "gender, sexual orientation, religion, disability."
[00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:14.160]   That's all it said.
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.800]   How could you complain about that?
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.640]   What do you got against respect?
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:19.720]   What are you, homophobic?
[00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:22.280]   What are you, against disabled people?
[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:25.880]   There are several problems with it.
[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:28.520]   One is it puts homosexuality
[00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:30.600]   in the same category with sexuality.
[00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:36.720]   Gender and sexual orientation are side by side.
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:39.180]   Respect sees no sexual orientation
[00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:43.440]   and respect sees no gender and no color.
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:48.640]   So once you've got sexual orientation listed beside
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:49.960]   whether you're male or female
[00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:52.160]   and whether you're black or white,
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:55.080]   then you can't feel any more strongly
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:56.320]   about this distinction
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.440]   than you can about these distinctions.
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:02.240]   Nobody feels that it's right or wrong
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:04.480]   to act black or act white.
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:06.160]   Nobody feels that it's right or wrong
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.280]   for a woman to act like a woman
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:08.360]   and a man to act like a man.
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:10.280]   And therefore, obviously, nobody should feel
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:12.120]   that it's right or wrong for a person
[00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:14.640]   who has a homosexual orientation to act that way
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.800]   and a one who has a heterosexual orientation
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:17.800]   to act that way.
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.320]   That's the message of the poster.
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.040]   As soon as you line up those things
[00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:24.160]   without any distinction,
[00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:28.360]   gender, color, religion, sexual orientation,
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:29.800]   you've told the students,
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:31.600]   treat them on the same level.
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.400]   They're not on the same level.
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.960]   To be a male or a female is a holy and good thing
[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:41.960]   created by God and endorsed by God in God's image.
[00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:44.400]   To act out a homosexual orientation
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:46.640]   and to act out a heterosexual orientation
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:50.200]   are profoundly different than that category.
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.440]   That's the first problem.
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:54.120]   The second problem is the statement,
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:58.240]   "Respect sees no."
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:00.280]   All that the public schools can do
[00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:02.880]   since they have forsaken almost all,
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:04.600]   where I live anyway, I don't know where it is,
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:05.600]   where you are down here.
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:08.160]   From what I hear, it's amazingly different.
[00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:10.920]   But it'll be here eventually in the public schools.
[00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:13.360]   The public schools have forsaken virtually all truth
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:17.760]   and all normative reality and behavior and God talk.
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:20.680]   And so they don't have any positive foundations
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:22.000]   for respect.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.280]   They can't say to a student,
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:27.160]   "Respect somebody because you see in them this."
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:30.000]   They say, "Respect sees no."
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.400]   And then lifts off things that respect doesn't see.
[00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:34.840]   So it leaves a big void underneath.
[00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:36.440]   Well, why should we respect anybody?
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:40.720]   Which is one of the reasons why there is so little respect
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:43.720]   among students for anything.
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:47.200]   The schools can't provide them with a positive foundation,
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:50.800]   the foundation for respecting black and white and male
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:53.840]   and female and people of other religions
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:58.600]   is God has created all human beings in his image.
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:00.880]   There is a way to respect a murderer.
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:02.880]   There's a way to respect a rapist.
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:04.520]   There's a way to respect somebody
[00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:05.440]   no matter what they've done
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:07.200]   because they're created in God's image.
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:08.880]   They are not snakes.
[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:10.840]   They're not frogs or horses.
[00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:13.520]   They are human beings no matter what they've done,
[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:16.000]   no matter their sexual orientation,
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.560]   no matter their sex, no matter their religion.
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:21.680]   There is a respect that one can accord them
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:23.880]   even if it might mean putting them in jail.
[00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:25.360]   You don't put snakes in jail.
[00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:28.120]   But you can't say anything like that.
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:30.800]   You can't provide a foundation for respect
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:32.680]   in the image of God.
[00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:36.360]   And so students are left with a groundless call to respect
[00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.960]   and they say, "What's the deal?
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:40.160]   "Why shouldn't I shoot him?
[00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:41.560]   "He mouthed off to me."
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:46.720]   And the third problem with that is in fact,
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:51.720]   respect does see gender and religion
[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:54.480]   and it makes a difference.
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:15:01.680]   There are courtesies and forms of respect
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:05.480]   that men owe to women that they don't owe to men.
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:09.920]   The one I could get most agreement on is
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:12.720]   you don't go in her locker room, you go in his locker room.
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:18.480]   To tell these students that respect sees no gender
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:20.920]   is terribly destructive.
[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:24.920]   It sees she's a woman and I will treat her differently
[00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:26.840]   than I treat these guys
[00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:29.560]   that I'm always treating in certain ways.
[00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:32.040]   I will offer certain courtesies,
[00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:34.200]   I will offer certain respect.
[00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:36.400]   I will acknowledge sexual differences
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:39.480]   that will mean I don't take liberties with her
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:41.760]   that I might take with him.
[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:44.520]   To tell them you don't see it is wrong.
[00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:45.880]   Same thing with religion.
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:48.800]   Respect looks at a Satanist
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:52.000]   who's involved in ritual satanic abuse
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.720]   and he looks at a Jewish person
[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:55.880]   who's trying to keep the 10 commandments,
[00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:57.720]   neither of whom know Jesus Christ
[00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:00.160]   and he will respect this Jewish person
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.880]   more than this satanic person.
[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:05.880]   I'd stand up in any group and say that.
[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:08.400]   Respect does have eyes for gender,
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:11.240]   it does have eyes for religion
[00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:15.440]   and they make a difference in the kind and form of respect
[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:17.920]   that you give to a person.
[00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:20.800]   Well, I just plead with you,
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:23.920]   take advantage of these years here at Bryan
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:26.800]   to become discerning men and women
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:29.200]   so that when you read in the paper
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:32.120]   or when you see a poster
[00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:33.800]   or when you look at a billboard
[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:35.800]   or you hear an advertisement,
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:38.440]   you are not blown about.
[00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:41.560]   They don't insinuate ideas in your mind
[00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:43.760]   that don't come through the critical filter
[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:45.880]   of biblical thinking.
[00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:48.720]   Be the kind of people who can go to a principal
[00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:52.240]   and explain to a PTA group or a principal
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:53.720]   just what I've explained to you,
[00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:57.040]   why those posters are destructive,
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:59.000]   even if they don't agree with you.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.320]   The world is dying for want of people
[00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:06.400]   to stand up and speak that kind of truth.
[00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:09.840]   Crazy relevant clip, 30 years later,
[00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:11.680]   that was from Pastor John's lecture series,
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:14.880]   "Manhood, Womanhood, and God."
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:19.880]   This here from part four, delivered September 22nd, 1993.
[00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:21.880]   You can listen to that message
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:24.920]   and the whole series at desiringgod.org.
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:27.360]   Thanks for listening to the clip.
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:30.160]   You all find some real gems in the Piper Archive.
[00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:31.280]   Man, that's incredible.
[00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:34.040]   And that's why most of our clips are crowdsourced now.
[00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:35.400]   You find them.
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:37.680]   You tell us what bits of Piper sermons impact you,
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:39.240]   stand out to you, and we share that clip
[00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:40.400]   with the APJ audience.
[00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:41.720]   If you've got one, email me.
[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:43.560]   Give me your name, hometown, the sermon title,
[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:45.880]   and the timestamp of where the clip happens in the audio,
[00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:47.640]   and tell me how it impacted you.
[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:49.880]   Put the word clip in the subject line of an email
[00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:53.440]   and send it to me at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:56.960]   That's an email address, askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:01.700]   Well, is our experience of salvation an event
[00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:03.600]   or is it a process?
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:06.480]   Are we saved in a moment or are we saved
[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:08.960]   in a series of unfolding events?
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:11.280]   It's a great and important question,
[00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:13.160]   and it's up next when we are rejoined in studio
[00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:14.840]   with Pastor John on Friday.
[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:15.680]   We'll see you then.
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:16.640]   Thanks for listening.
[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:19.220]   (upbeat music)
[00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:21.800]   (upbeat music)
[00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:31.800]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
