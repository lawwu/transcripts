[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   (silence)
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:07.840]   One of the most remarkable real-life examples
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.800]   I've ever witnessed of the power of belief in God,
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.480]   I'm just gonna say it as it occurred,
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.640]   I have a good friend who for many years struggled
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.560]   with alcohol and drug addiction of multiple kinds.
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.360]   Incredibly kind person, incredibly successful in his career,
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.800]   married, two beautiful children,
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.640]   multiple relapses, crashed his truck at seven in the morning
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.200]   after getting intoxicated at 6.30 in the morning,
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.520]   got out of that one, happened again and again,
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.600]   multiple rehab centers of the sort of standard treatment,
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.020]   et cetera, and then ultimately enough happened
[00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.680]   within that whole set of circumstances
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.280]   that his wife said, you know, this is it.
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.000]   You've got to solve this or we just can't be with you.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.200]   A very scary situation for everybody involved,
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.980]   including him, who absolutely adored his family.
[00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:05.080]   He told us, his friends, that he was going to go
[00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.920]   to a center here in Los Angeles that treats addiction
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.360]   with essentially religion, a belief in God.
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.960]   He was already fairly religious.
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.920]   Most Sundays he attended church and things of that sort.
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.000]   And you can imagine we all thought, including myself,
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.600]   like, okay, dude, like, good luck.
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.480]   I hope this works.
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.600]   But like, I would say zero minus one confidence
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.360]   in his ability to get and stay sober.
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.120]   He just had not succeeded prior to this.
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.960]   He's been sober more than four years now.
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.640]   He got out of there and never looked back.
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.560]   And I wonder now whether something,
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.120]   something must've changed in his brain
[00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.720]   by adopting what was essentially a-
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.200]   - Different incentive structure.
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.700]   - Right, different incentive structure,
[00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.360]   but fear wasn't doing it before,
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.560]   fear of extreme consequences,
[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.240]   which were on the table at that time,
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.520]   when he went in, weren't enough.
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.440]   Something about going there
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.520]   and the work that he did there allowed him to then,
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.640]   it's almost like he got another prefrontal cortex,
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.820]   a more powerful prefrontal cortex.
[00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.160]   So maybe we could talk about that.
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.520]   - Well, that's not a bad way of thinking about what it is
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.980]   that people are trying to do when they, say, pray.
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.640]   So you can invite in spirits to possess you.
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.100]   That's a good way of thinking about it.
[00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.740]   I know that's odd terminology,
[00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.980]   but that's what you do when you dwell on your rage.
[00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.420]   Right, right.
[00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.780]   Now imagine that you're doing that
[00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.100]   in the most positive possible direction.
[00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.020]   So what you're doing is you're generating a hypothesis
[00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.580]   about the mode of conduct and perception
[00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.420]   that would best typify you if you were ideal,
[00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.980]   and then establishing a relationship with that
[00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.060]   and inviting it in.
[00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.220]   That's what the evangelical Protestants are doing
[00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.160]   when they formulate a personal relationship
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.420]   with Jesus Christ.
[00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.820]   That's exactly what they're doing.
[00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.060]   Now on the addiction side,
[00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.980]   so I studied alcoholism for years.
[00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.940]   That was the target of my dissertation
[00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.420]   in the first 20 papers that I published.
[00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.540]   I knew the alcoholism literature very well,
[00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.640]   and the neurological end of it as well.
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.060]   And it was known, among alcohol researchers,
[00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.620]   it's been known for 60 years, more even,
[00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.740]   that the most reliable treatment for alcoholism
[00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:28.700]   was religious transformation.
[00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.660]   And this is well accepted among researchers in the field
[00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.260]   who have no religious affiliation whatsoever.
[00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.380]   And I do believe that a huge part of that
[00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.820]   is a consequence of incentive restructuring.
[00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.420]   So you said, for example, with your friend,
[00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.140]   that fear wouldn't work.
[00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.820]   Well, alcohol's a pretty good anxiolytic drug,
[00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.500]   but it's also, for people who are prone to alcoholism,
[00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.340]   it's a good incentive reward source, like cocaine.
[00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.060]   If you're going to, you can't get rats addicted to cocaine
[00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.620]   if they live in a natural environment.
[00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.260]   They have to be isolated in a cage
[00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.020]   before they'll bar press to their own death for cocaine.
[00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.620]   So one of the things you wanna do when you treat addiction
[00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.660]   is you wanna substitute a new incentive structure, right?
[00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.260]   Because part of the addictive process
[00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.900]   is you fall into a false incentive pattern, right?
[00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.140]   'Cause cocaine makes you feel
[00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.020]   like you're doing something useful
[00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:25.580]   in respect to an important goal, even though you're not.
[00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:26.860]   It mimics that.
[00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.020]   - Even if you know you're not.
[00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.860]   - Even if you know it's irrelevant.
[00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.220]   - And I'll just say, I've never done cocaine.
[00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.460]   I would be open about it if I had.
[00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.900]   I think I like dopaminergic states enough
[00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.060]   that I've been very scared of doing it, frankly.
[00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.100]   Also, it wasn't around much
[00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.460]   just because of when I went to college.
[00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:41.940]   It just wasn't a drug that was around much.
[00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.200]   But it's a remarkable drug in the sense
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.860]   that people who take cocaine
[00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.960]   seem to be excited about everything.
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.880]   They're in this high dopaminergic state.
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.840]   And their brain becomes exceptionally good
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.960]   at finding cocaine, even in the absence of resources,
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.740]   which is pretty remarkable if you think about it.
[00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.460]   I mean, most people can't find the thing
[00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:00.460]   or get the thing they want
[00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.600]   in the absence of the resources to get it.
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.860]   But people who take hard drugs
[00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.160]   that really spike dopamine somehow manage.
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.020]   Yeah, sure, sometimes they lie,
[00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.380]   sometimes lie, cheat, and steal.
[00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:12.220]   Lie, cheat, and steal,
[00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:13.500]   but they'll do other things too, right?
[00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.100]   They'll socialize with people that have it
[00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.620]   so they don't have to lie, cheat, and steal.
[00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.740]   It's incredible to see that drug
[00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.900]   and things like methamphetamine take over people's minds.
[00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.220]   And now I'm thinking-
[00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:28.380]   The pathway appears when the aim is firmly in mind, right?
[00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.100]   See, this is another insistence
[00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.380]   that's derived from the religious literature.
[00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:37.820]   So, because the idea there is that if your aim is upward,
[00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.940]   the pathway forward to that will make itself manifest.
[00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.060]   And that's true.
[00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:44.140]   You just pointed out that it was true
[00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:46.060]   in relationship to addiction, right?
[00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:49.780]   Is that if once you're in that realm
[00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.340]   of possessed personality,
[00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.500]   the pathway forward will show itself to you
[00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.840]   even under straitened circumstances, right?
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.620]   And it's partly because you can think
[00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.120]   of our perceptual systems and our emotional systems,
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.300]   for that matter, as navigating tools, right?
[00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.420]   So now the addiction, the addicted brain,
[00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:09.340]   what they say, the aim is possessed
[00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.300]   by the substance of addiction, right?
[00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.020]   So now the highest god is cocaine.
[00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:14.860]   Let's say.
[00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.860]   And so now all pathways in the world
[00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.340]   are pathways to cocaine.
[00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.860]   All objects in the world are markers
[00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:22.580]   on the pathway to cocaine.
[00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:26.040]   'Cause it just dominates, but it's not just an impulse.
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.900]   It dominates the perceptual landscape as well.
[00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:30.820]   That's makes it, and the emotional landscape.
[00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:33.340]   And it comes with all these rationalizations.
[00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.500]   That's all those lies, right?
[00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.820]   The whole thing, it's a whole personality.
[00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:39.820]   Yeah, brutal, brutal.
[00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:42.400]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.980]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.560]   (upbeat music)
