[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from financial samurai and in this episode
[00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:09.440]   I want to talk about the importance of protecting your wealth. That's not funny money
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:17.040]   Funny money to me is any type of wealth that you just look on the computer screen and you can't touch and there's no utility
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.360]   So in other words funny money can include stock market wealth
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.700]   Cryptocurrency wealth and other type of wealth that really has no utility
[00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:34.420]   And the reason why I want to talk about this again is because something amazing happened the world's second biggest
[00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.200]   crypto exchange
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.320]   FTX
[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.320]   Just got bought out today. Well, it's in due diligence talks to get bought out by the number one
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:49.240]   cryptocurrency exchange finance because FTX was perhaps secretly insolvent or
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:55.920]   Lending out customer deposits or investing customer deposits when it shouldn't have nobody knows for sure
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.440]   but the bottom line is that the value of FTX which was once worth maybe
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:08.920]   Twelve thirteen billion dollars is now worth only a dollar because customers have withdrawn their capital
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.720]   So things aren't working anymore
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.720]   but the interesting thing is
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:21.280]   Supposedly about seven plus billion dollars of Bankman Freed's net worth was in his crypto trading house Alameda research
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:29.800]   Which also has plummeted to a value of maybe a dollar because what it held has also sunk tremendously in value
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.220]   It's very complicated. But the bottom line is Sam Bankman Freed's net worth
[00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:42.640]   Plummeted from around fifteen point six billion to only quote only one billion dollars in a 24-hour time span
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.760]   So funny money is real folks
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:51.320]   You know all the value that we assign to our net worth to our investments that provide no real utility
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:58.640]   Is very subjective it can be anything the market wants one day and totally different the next day
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.160]   You know you see even with stocks right earnings misses of let's say five percent five percent
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.600]   Miss on the top line or three percent miss on the bottom line and these growth stocks
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.640]   Get crushed they get crushed by ten twenty plus percent in just one day
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:24.040]   Because future estimates have to be ratcheted down and so when we invest in funny money if we invest in things
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.800]   That are subjective in value then we must be prepared for that volatility
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:36.120]   But more importantly if you want to protect your wealth preserve your capital, especially after you've made a lot
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.800]   You probably want to consistently convert some of that funny money into real assets
[00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.980]   So the number one real asset most super wealthy people convert their funny money into is in real estate
[00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.820]   Because real estate is tangible it provides utility. It's less volatile and
[00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.960]   It generally generates income higher income higher
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:03.480]   Yields than other assets normally, of course real estate can also go down in value
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.520]   Especially if the market is highly over levered we saw that in 2008 in 2009
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:15.760]   But for the most part real estate is more stable and it'll probably last long after you're gone
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:24.640]   You know how sometimes you see in the news like some billionaire buys a hundred million dollar property or 50 million here or 200 million
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:31.760]   And you think yourself who the hell needs like 20,000 square foot mega mansion, right with 20 bathrooms
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.660]   And 18 bedrooms is just kind of nuts
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.360]   But the thing we must remember besides looking at these people and saying wow, you're nuts. You're greedy
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.680]   You could save the world with all your money
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:49.480]   Is that they want to try to preserve their capital because deep down they know a lot of this massive wealth that they've generated
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:55.560]   Is a lot of due to luck and a lot of it is funny money and very subjective in value
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.520]   So they can sell some of these assets convert it to their mega mansion
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:06.360]   Then at least they know that if all goes to hell right if their FTX exchange goes to zero
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.200]   They'll still have their hard assets to live off of now
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.000]   The problem is carrying costs are gonna be very expensive
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.800]   but these very wealthy folks have figured out a way to diversify their net worth and
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:25.100]   Earn income in other ways to preserve their lifestyles this strategy of converting funny money into real assets is
[00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.600]   very common for
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.680]   Foreign government officials now you would think if you're a foreign government official
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.040]   Let's say in China or I don't know a communist country or somewhere
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.040]   you wouldn't be making a lot of money, but uh,
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:47.040]   a lot of these folks make a ton of money and I won't get into the details on how they make a ton of
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.280]   money on a government salary
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:54.360]   But they do and what I've seen here in San Francisco is a lot of that foreign money
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:01.920]   Comes and buys up San Francisco real estate prime properties around the city and then they just leave them empty
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.880]   They leave them empty for years
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:10.320]   Yeah, they pay the property taxes and all that but what they've done is they've converted their funny money way of making money
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:16.300]   Into hard assets in a sovereign country like the United States where the currency is more stable
[00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:23.600]   The government is more stable. The assets are more stable and they're not going to be confiscated away by the government and I'm particularly
[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:30.680]   wary of this happening because one I live in San Francisco and before this I lived in New York City and
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.640]   Two it's because I lived overseas in
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:42.280]   Developing countries for 13 years and I worked in international equities for 13 years where I would travel back and forth
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:46.160]   to places like China India Hong Kong Taiwan
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.720]   Indonesia Malaysia and so forth from a foreigner's perspective
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:57.160]   US assets are very valuable and from an American's perspective who has never
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:03.060]   Traveled outside the country. I'm not sure how good we know we have it
[00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:08.880]   We take our freedom our stability our government for granted because this is all we know
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:13.720]   So everyone I encourage you to review your net worth asset allocation
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:20.880]   Look at what percentage of net worth is in funny money assets stuff that provides no utility or tangible value
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:28.720]   Maybe consider shifting some of that into hard assets and it doesn't have to be real estate. It can be fine art. It can be
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:35.880]   Expensive wine something that you can actually enjoy because if you accumulate all this money and you don't enjoy it
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:39.760]   You don't spend it. You know, what is the point? What is the point of everything?
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:45.960]   Well, I'll tell you the point the point is to use your money to live a better life and have more freedom to do what?
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.680]   You want now what's gonna happen to FTX the crypto exchange?
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.960]   Well, probably finance will not buy it instead
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:57.640]   finance will probably let it die because
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:01.120]   FTX was finances largest competitor
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:05.120]   So if you let your competitor die after you look at the books, you know
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:10.240]   You not only can you get inside information on what's going on with that exchange and its financials
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:16.360]   But you dominate more market share once your competitor dies. So this is a story
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:20.280]   Everybody should be following because it talks about
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.120]   treachery it talks about
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:27.720]   Competitive business dynamics it talks about huge amounts of wealth
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.280]   evaporating overnight
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:35.760]   I mean these are the reasons why maybe a lot of folks don't want to be entrepreneurs because it is a
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:42.800]   Cutthroat business folks and the bigger the stakes man the bigger the risks and the bigger the rewards and downfalls
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.920]   One final takeaway is that if you happen to be running a business
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:50.080]   You need to pay attention to your debt levels
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:55.240]   You can't have too much debt. Otherwise, you could be taken to the cleaners once revenue plummets
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:08:02.240]   Another thing is you might be tempted to do something funny with the cash on your company's balance sheet
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:09.360]   And the reason why it's considered funny is because whatever you plan to do with that cash might not be consistent
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:17.720]   With your business model, right if you run a business raising chickens, but you use your cash flow to invest in
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:23.240]   Cryptocurrency, it's not synergistic and you could get in trouble. For example
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:29.840]   Financial samurai has some cash on the balance sheet if I use the money to invest in real estate
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:32.240]   Not very synergistic
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:38.520]   It probably wouldn't sink the company because financial samurai is cash flow positive and there's no debt
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:44.680]   but you got to be careful because once you have that cash funny things start to happen in your mind and
[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:49.400]   Sometimes in CEOs minds they might want to use it to pay for their fancy
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.600]   Mansion off the books or something
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:57.720]   They might want to use it to invest in other things to try to make more money and make their company more valuable
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.240]   So, let's see how this all plays out
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:03.480]   but for cryptocurrency investors
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:10.080]   This is a blow to confidence and trust and as investors overall, you know trust is paramount
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:16.120]   You've got to trust the institution to be a caretaker of your money to do the right thing
[00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:21.480]   Otherwise, you're just gonna pull your money, which is what everybody did with FTX. Alright folks
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:26.640]   I hope you enjoyed this episode. And if you did, please leave a positive review. It is unfortunately
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:33.100]   Mass layoff season you're seeing all over the news about Elon Musk laying off about
[00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:37.120]   3,700 employees at Twitter or over 50% of its workforce
[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:41.980]   Facebook announced it will be laying off 13% of its workforce or about
[00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:48.440]   11,000 employees these companies are laying employees off because of poor share price performance
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:54.960]   Obviously a poor economic outlook and also the desire to save just on costs and not pay out RSUs
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:10:00.920]   bonuses so holiday times can be good or they can be bad and I encourage any
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:08.160]   Employee who is worried about their future at the firm or who wants to find some new opportunity and leave
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:14.800]   To plan out a severance negotiation. I wrote a book in 2012 that has helped
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:20.520]   Literally thousands of people negotiate tens of millions dollars in severance to leave a job
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:25.760]   They dislike to do something else or to retire early and the book is now in its fifth edition
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:33.140]   For 2022. So if you want to save $10 on the book use the code save 10 as a V E T E N on
[00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:38.480]   Checkout and you'll save $10 and I'll put it in the show notes. Take care everyone. Be well
