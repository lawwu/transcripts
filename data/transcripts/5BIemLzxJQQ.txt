[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440]   These men at the end of the end of history are these pathetic
[00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.040]   last men who have no desire for recognition, they just want to
[00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.880]   be comfortable. And you've made the comparison with that and
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.720]   big tech. And one of the things Fukuyama talks about in the book
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.360]   is once there is a struggle that requires the first men of
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.040]   history who can withstand adversity and can accomplish
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.800]   great things, you won't have them around by the time that
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.720]   things have gotten comfortable for a while. Are there enough
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.720]   first men left in companies like Twitter and Facebook that now
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.440]   they do face adversity, they can, you know, just like, reboot
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.280]   and go into wartime again?
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:40.280]   Yeah, I suspect they are, I think I think Tolkien gets it
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.000]   right, you know, just because someone is born a hobbit, and
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.320]   they live in Hobbiton, and they have this nice, comfortable
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.000]   life, like they still have that capacity for and yearning for
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.760]   adventure, and that in the right circumstances, they will, they
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.000]   will rise to the occasion and go ahead and do it. And this seems
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   to happen with, with a lot of countries when they face these
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.320]   great stresses.
