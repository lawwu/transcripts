[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.600]   Well, we launch into a new week with a wonderful Bible question.
[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.080]   It comes to us from Juliet in Canada.
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.640]   "Dear Pastor John, hello.
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:16.840]   In John 21-7, we read about a disciple whom Jesus loved.
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.680]   Can you tell me who this is?
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.200]   Who is this disciple whom Jesus loved?
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.200]   And why is he referenced like this?
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.360]   I assume Jesus loved all his disciples.
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.800]   Is there any takeaway for us in the love designation directed to this one disciple?
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.280]   I have always wondered about this, and I thought if I am ever going to ask, you would be the
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.960]   person to ask."
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.360]   Thank you, Juliet.
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.720]   Perhaps the first thing to observe is that whoever this disciple is, namely the one who
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:54.460]   is identified five times in this gospel as the disciple whom Jesus loved, we know he
[00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.700]   was the one who wrote the gospel.
[00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:07.800]   In the last chapter, chapter 21, it says in verse 20, "Peter turned and saw the disciple
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.760]   whom Jesus loved following them."
[00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.360]   That is, following Peter and Jesus.
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.680]   And then four verses later, it says, "This disciple," namely the one who is following
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.840]   Peter, "this disciple, the one whom Jesus loved, is the one who is bearing witness about
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.800]   these things and who has written these things."
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.040]   21-24.
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:37.920]   So there is an explicit claim in the gospel that this particular disciple, the one whom
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.000]   Jesus loved, is the author of the gospel.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.440]   Now before we move toward an identification of who it is, let's just be clear that when
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:56.840]   the author calls himself five times the one whom Jesus loved, he's not saying that Jesus
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.520]   doesn't love the others.
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:07.320]   It's this very author who says in John 11-5 that Jesus loved Mary and Martha and Lazarus.
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:15.840]   It's this very author who says in John 13-1, "Having loved his own who were in the world,
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:22.000]   he loved them to the end," sometimes translated, "to the uttermost."
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.920]   That's all of them.
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.920]   And in John 15-9, he quotes Jesus saying, "As the Father has loved me, so I have loved
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.660]   you," plural, all of you, my disciples.
[00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.640]   And in 15-12, he says, "This is my commandment, that you love one another, as I have loved
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.920]   you," all of you.
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:49.960]   In other words, this writer is not trying to claim for himself the love of Jesus while
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.440]   excluding others from it.
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.880]   Something else is going on.
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.640]   I'll come back to that in a minute.
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.800]   But back to the question of who is it?
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.320]   Who are we talking about?
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:06.040]   We know from the other gospels that Peter, James, and John were the closest associates
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.040]   of Jesus.
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:14.520]   For example, those three, Peter, James, and John, went up with Jesus on the Mount of Transfiguration.
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:24.480]   It appears from the way the gospel, this gospel presents this unnamed disciple that he had
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.560]   quite a close relationship with Peter.
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:36.040]   For example, John 13-23, at the Last Supper, it says, "One of his disciples, whom Jesus
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:45.840]   loved, was reclining at the table at Jesus' side, so Simon Peter motioned to him and asked
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.940]   Jesus who he's talking about when he mentioned that there's going to be a betrayer."
[00:03:50.940 --> 00:04:00.280]   So the unnamed disciple is close at Jesus' side, and Peter has this exchange of communication
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.280]   with him.
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:07.680]   Then on the morning of the resurrection, Mary Magdalene runs to report what she has seen,
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:14.880]   and it says, "So she ran and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one whom
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.560]   Jesus loved, and told them."
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.320]   Chapter 20, verse 2.
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:25.480]   So there they are, apparently hanging out together, this unnamed disciple and Peter.
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:33.640]   Then the author of this gospel tells us in chapter 21, verse 2, that the sons of Zebedee,
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:41.880]   which would be James and John, we know from Matthew 4-21, go fishing with Peter and four
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:42.880]   other disciples.
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.280]   They're going to go fishing after the resurrection.
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:54.480]   And when Jesus called out from the shore to them, it says in verse 7, "The disciple whom
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:05:00.040]   Jesus loved said to Peter, 'It's the Lord.'"
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:07.840]   And then finally, in chapter 21, verse 20, the disciple whom Jesus loved is seen following
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.420]   Peter and Jesus.
[00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:18.040]   So you have this repeated, close relationship between the disciple whom Jesus loved and
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.040]   Peter.
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:26.400]   And we know that Peter, James, and John had a very close relationship with each other
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.560]   and with Jesus.
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:35.340]   And we know that John, one of the sons of Zebedee, was on the boat fishing when a disciple
[00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:40.160]   is identified as the one whom Jesus loved, was there.
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:47.360]   And we know that by the time this gospel was written, James had been killed.
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.720]   That's chapter 12, verse 2.
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:57.080]   So he's not an option for who this very close relationship with Peter was, who's called
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.000]   the one whom Jesus loved.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:08.480]   That leaves us with the high probability that John, the apostle, is the disciple whom Jesus
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.180]   loved and is the author of this gospel.
[00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:21.340]   And the tradition outside the Bible has almost uniformly agreed with this conclusion ever
[00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:30.400]   since the beginning, which leads us back now to the question, why does this author, John,
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:37.460]   the apostle, call himself five times the disciple whom Jesus loved?
[00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:41.260]   And let me just give you three closing suggestions.
[00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:49.060]   First, it identifies the author as an eyewitness throughout the ministry of Jesus.
[00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:57.420]   He refers to himself in this oblique way at the Last Supper, at the cross as he receives
[00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:04.860]   Jesus' mother into his family, at the empty tomb, and in the face-to-face contact with
[00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:06.360]   Jesus after the resurrection.
[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:12.420]   He was there, and this gospel is his eyewitness account.
[00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:24.180]   Second, perhaps this is John's way of saying, "My most important identity is not my name,
[00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:27.680]   but my being loved by Jesus, the Son of God."
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:32.020]   He's not trying to rob anybody else of this privilege.
[00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:34.140]   He is simply exalting in it.
[00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:35.140]   "I'm loved.
[00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:36.140]   I'm loved.
[00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:37.140]   I'm loved.
[00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:39.100]   That's who I am.
[00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:42.660]   I'm loved by Jesus."
[00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:50.700]   And third, perhaps he was speaking like the apostle Paul when Paul said, "The love of
[00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:56.780]   Christ controls us because we have concluded this, that one has died for all, therefore
[00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:03.560]   all have died, and he died for all, that those who live might no longer live for themselves,
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:07.540]   but for him who for their sake died and was raised."
[00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:09.720]   Second Corinthians 5.14.
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:19.280]   In other words, John would be saying, "I identify myself as loved by Christ because this is
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:25.620]   the all-constraining, all-controlling reality in my life.
[00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:28.120]   This is why I am writing the gospel.
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:32.400]   This is why I minister, why I live.
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:35.760]   Christ's love for me controls me."
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.480]   Man, wow, yes.
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:40.040]   The marvel of being loved by the Savior.
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:41.480]   May that never be lost on us.
[00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:42.960]   Pastor John, thank you for answering it.
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:45.480]   Juliet, thank you for asking it.
[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:49.000]   And if you have a Bible question you've always wanted to ask John Piper, do it.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:58.400]   Message us through our homepage at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn, and we will do our best to answer it here on
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.800]   the podcast.
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:05.640]   Well the Apostle Paul uses a startling phrase in 2 Corinthians 6.10.
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.960]   "Sorrowful, yet always rejoicing."
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:11.720]   Sorrowful, yet always rejoicing.
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:17.180]   It's startling because he's talking about his own testimony of rejoicing in sorrow.
[00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:22.120]   And those two experiences run consecutively in his life.
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:25.680]   Sorrow and joy coexist in his experience at the same time.
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:30.560]   It's simply a truism of life that good things and bad things are always happening to us
[00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:33.280]   all the time, simultaneously in our lives.
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.520]   This is how it works, right?
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:38.720]   John Piper's going to explain next time how this all works.
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:39.720]   I'm your host Tony Rehnke.
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.320]   We'll see you back here on Wednesday.
