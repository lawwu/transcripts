[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.160]   Hello, everybody.
[00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:03.480]   It's Sam from Financial Samurai.
[00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.880]   In this episode, we're going to talk about the average net worth for the above average
[00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:08.880]   married couple.
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.720]   So if you're single right now, don't worry.
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.240]   I think there's someone out there for you.
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.040]   You just have to make it your mission to find someone because from a financial perspective,
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.800]   I think life is much easier with someone.
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.680]   Instead of paying the full $2,500 a month in rent, you can split it $1,250 each and
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.640]   that brings more disposable income into your pocket.
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.320]   And obviously, besides sharing more of your expenses, life is just more interesting when
[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.360]   you have someone to care about who will go through the journey together.
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.520]   So what is the definition of above average?
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.520]   Well, first of all, I don't want any of you guys to get offended if you are considered
[00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.920]   average or below average.
[00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.040]   It's just math.
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.960]   Think about the bell curve.
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.760]   And what we're trying to do is be above average because life is â€“ we only got one shot,
[00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:59.760]   right?
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.080]   So we might as well try a little bit harder and do a little bit better so we can try to
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.520]   live a better life and help our finances.
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.080]   So the above average person is loosely defined as someone who graduated from college.
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.080]   Only about 35% of the American population has a college degree.
[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:21.200]   Now if you've got a job right out of high school and you are making above average income
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.680]   for your city or state, then you're obviously above average.
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.600]   The above average person works hard, plays well with others, takes full advantage of
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.560]   their pre-tax retirement accounts, saves additional disposable income so they can generate passive
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.160]   income and they stay on top of their finances.
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.600]   The above average person is also quite reasonable.
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.320]   They don't expect anything from their parents or from the government.
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.960]   And if they were C students in school, they don't expect to live an A lifestyle.
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.120]   This is pretty important here, folks, this last line.
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.920]   If you're a C student and you expect to live an A lifestyle, you're probably going to be
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.040]   miserable.
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.120]   And this is what I see happening more and more today.
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.760]   People want to go straight to the top, straight to the corner office without putting in their
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.040]   dues.
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:18.000]   So now that we've got the definition of what above average is, let's look at the data.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.800]   The average net worth, depending on where you look, is somewhere between $150,000 to
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.800]   $250,000.
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.000]   But the median net worth in America is closer to about $80,000.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.600]   So the average is being brought up by the super wealthy in America who have benefited
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:40.040]   the most from the super boom, sonic boom, since 2009, 2010.
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:46.360]   The lesson there is you've got to own risk assets such as stocks, real estate and so
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.120]   forth because over the long term, it's probably going to do well for you.
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.560]   So now that we know the averages, let's look at what the average net worth for the above
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.200]   average person should be.
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:05.400]   I did a pretty detailed analysis in terms of years worked, average pre-tax savings,
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:12.120]   average post-tax savings, and average property equity and combine them into a chart.
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.720]   And here are some of the numbers.
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:19.840]   At 25 years old, the above average person has got about $79,000 in net worth.
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.200]   At 30, $250,000.
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.440]   At 35, about $430,000.
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.280]   At 40, $660,000.
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.880]   At 45, $914,000.
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.120]   At 50, $1.24 million.
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.300]   At 55, $1.7 million.
[00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.000]   At 60, about $2.2 million.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.640]   And at 65, about $3 million.
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:49.240]   So that's what I think the above average person should be able to accumulate in his or her
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.680]   lifetime.
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:57.480]   Steady work, steady savings, building property equity, paying off that mortgage and so forth.
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:03.720]   So how does that translate into target net worth amounts by age for the above average
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:04.720]   couple?
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:10.400]   Now, I don't want folks to get fixated by the numbers, although the numbers are important.
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:17.040]   I want to kind of talk a little bit more philosophically about how do we combine our finances and have
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.760]   targets to shoot for.
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.460]   Now everybody knows that married couples who stay together have a financial advantage over
[00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.960]   single people.
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.280]   We can again share expenses and grow things together.
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.280]   It's much easier.
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.400]   And before we get into the exercise of figuring out the net worth of the above average couple,
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.920]   let's take a moment to define an above average couple.
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:43.760]   They stay together for the long term, so they don't divorce because divorce is probably
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.960]   the biggest detriment to your finances, for couples finances that is.
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:55.360]   They discuss long term financial goals such as retirement age, retirement number, succession
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.840]   planning, like a will and trust and so forth.
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.280]   They don't keep any financial secrets from each other.
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.480]   They know their monthly budgets like the back of their hand.
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:11.020]   They make sure their net worth risk exposure is aligned with their goals.
[00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.820]   They share expenses in a fair way.
[00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.040]   They support each other's career and endeavors.
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.000]   They work together as a team to get things done.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.040]   They seek to understand the other side of the story during conflicts and always come
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.080]   to a compromise.
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:31.640]   They plan for the financial expense of children, even if they don't have any.
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:36.440]   Each spouse can financially support themselves if the relationship ends.
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:42.840]   This is a very important one to me because I do believe financial dependence is the worst.
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.520]   If you love your spouse, you want to set them free financially.
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:53.440]   You want to make them feel as they can do anything they want with their money and your
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.440]   money.
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.480]   I know this topic is up for debate and I've written a post about it and we can talk about
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:59.480]   it in a future episode.
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.400]   I'd love to get my wife on and talk about it.
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:08.440]   But freedom from each other financially is very important even though you're still together.
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:09.720]   So we'll talk later.
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:14.940]   And then finally, the above average couple only have children if they've run the numbers
[00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.480]   and know that they can afford children.
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:24.500]   Now as a parent myself, I do realize now why so many couples who are financially struggling
[00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.480]   have so many children.
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:33.920]   The answer is you don't realize how much joy children bring to you until you have children.
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:38.860]   And then you just want more of it rationally even though your budget can't afford it.
[00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:43.260]   But above average people are quite rational and they think rationally that it's better
[00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.600]   to have enough money to take care of your children.
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:51.360]   Otherwise maybe bad things will happen in terms of neglect, stress at home, and they
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:57.440]   might turn out to be, I don't know, maybe not so happy or really troubled kids or adults
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.340]   and that wouldn't be really good for society.
[00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:05.120]   So let's move on to various net worth calculation methods for couples.
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:08.140]   There are only three methods that I would like to introduce.
[00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:10.080]   One is the equality method.
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.240]   The second is the government taxation method.
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:16.540]   And the final one is the financial samurai method.
[00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:18.380]   So let's go with the equality method.
[00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:23.280]   The equality method basically states that a man and a woman are equal.
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:29.720]   Given both sexes are equal, it is only logical to conclude that both spouses study hard at
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:35.620]   school, work, save, and invest for the future before and after meeting each other.
[00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:40.280]   One simply has to double the amounts in my above average person net worth chart to get
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:43.760]   to the equality net worth figures.
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:50.840]   So in other words, by 30, the number should be about 500,000 for the total net worth.
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:53.920]   By 35, about 850,000.
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:57.480]   By 40, 1.32 million.
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:00.260]   By 45, 1.8 million.
[00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.060]   By 50, 2.5 million.
[00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:06.080]   By 55, 3.4 million.
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.280]   By 60, 4.3 million.
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:12.100]   And by 65, around 5.7 million.
[00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:16.960]   Now I can hear some of you guys grumble and complain saying those figures are just way
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:19.020]   too high.
[00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:24.040]   Now I don't know what country you're living in, but I live in America and men and women
[00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.000]   are equal.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.760]   And if men and women are not equal in your country, please leave a comment and explain
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:36.760]   what the heck is going on because it is 2019 folks, soon to be 2020.
[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:40.160]   And if people are not equal by now, then I don't know when people are ever going to be
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:41.480]   equal.
[00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:45.360]   Now some of you are probably arguing these figures are too low because there are tremendous
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:48.440]   financial synergies in a relationship.
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:52.420]   Since you can't have synergies before you actually meet, it's better to simply double
[00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:56.520]   the above average net worth per person figures to stay conservative.
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:01.240]   Alright now the next method, the government taxation method.
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:03.240]   This is quite an interesting one.
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:08.560]   Despite tremendous federal income tax improvement after Trump became president, there is still
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:10.760]   a marriage penalty tax.
[00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:15.680]   If you take a look at the tax brackets and rates for 2019, which will probably be very
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:22.080]   similar in 2020, notice how an individual pays a 37% marginal federal income tax bracket
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:26.540]   after they make $510,300.
[00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:32.720]   But if you look at a married couple's column here, a married couple starts paying a 37%
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:39.040]   marginal federal income tax above only $612,350.
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:42.400]   In other words, 1+1 does not equal 2.
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:47.120]   Instead 1+1 equals 1.21.
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:54.040]   Because if 1+1=2, married couples should pay the 37% tax rate when their income is above
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:58.340]   about $1,020,600.
[00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:00.080]   So what's going on here?
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:07.040]   Well, 1) if there are two high income earning couples each making above $510,300, they probably
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:08.280]   shouldn't get married.
[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:15.160]   2) if you're a couple making above $612,350 combined, you probably shouldn't get married
[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:19.120]   if you want to, that is, pay more taxes to an inefficient government.
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:25.280]   But 3) what is really going on is that the government believes 1+1=1.21 because it is
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:26.280]   sexist.
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:30.400]   It is holding on to old ways of thinking.
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.160]   Think about the makeup of the government.
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.800]   It's largely made up of men.
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:38.160]   And men think one way, women think another way.
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.200]   Things are changing, but it's predominantly made up of men.
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:46.040]   The president is a man, congress, senators, they're mostly men.
[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:52.320]   And therefore, they have this ideology that one spouse should stay at home and take care
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:53.400]   of the children.
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:58.040]   And that one spouse, if you look at statistics, is usually the woman.
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:01.080]   I've been a stay at home dad for 29 months now.
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:05.400]   And I will certainly say there are hardly any men out there when I take my boy to the
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:08.040]   playground or to the museum or park.
[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:10.080]   I would say the numbers look like this.
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:13.840]   This is here in San Francisco where the cost of living is high and I guess people don't
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:18.000]   really want to take care of their kids as much or they can't.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:24.800]   The percentages are about 80% of the caretakers of children that I see between Monday and
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.280]   Friday are nannies.
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:30.960]   About 20% are moms.
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:34.840]   About 8% are grandparents, maybe 9%.
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:37.340]   And then the rest are dads.
[00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:43.400]   So maybe in this land of change and equality, maybe the government is right after all.
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:48.400]   Maybe we're just not equal because I really don't see any dads staying at home taking
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:50.000]   care of their children.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:57.800]   But still, conceptually and I think philosophically, one plus one should equal two but the government
[00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.800]   has different ideas.
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:03.280]   Now of course, there are tremendous benefits of having a stay at home spouse take care
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:04.280]   of their kids, right?
[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:07.780]   You know, your children get more love from the person you trust the most.
[00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:14.020]   The nanny, I swear to goodness, they're probably 80% on their phones and not paying any attention.
[00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:20.100]   Also, okay, daycare costs a lot and there's other great benefits to having one stay at
[00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:21.540]   home spouse.
[00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:26.060]   But I still believe the ratio, the math is too low.
[00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:33.460]   The combined income of $612,350 provides only a 20% greater threshold until the top 37%
[00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:34.460]   tax rate kicks in.
[00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:35.780]   It should be higher.
[00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:38.020]   I believe it should be higher.
[00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:42.160]   But if you love the government, are very traditional and believe one spouse should probably stay
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:47.820]   at home, then you are a proponent of the government taxation net worth method.
[00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:52.960]   So finally, let me introduce, I think the best way, the financial samurai method to
[00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:58.060]   calculating an above average couple's net worth by age.
[00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:02.220]   The financial samurai net worth method provides a recognition there are financial synergies
[00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:03.820]   for being a couple.
[00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:08.860]   At the same time, the financial samurai method denounces government policies to its core
[00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:12.220]   for its sexist and discriminatory ways.
[00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:18.180]   Besides, the ludicrous 20% increased allowance for married couples, the government only provides
[00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:24.820]   child tax credits, student interest deductions, and IRA contributions to those who make below
[00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:27.940]   a certain amount.
[00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:33.700]   So why is the government deciding so much on who gets to benefit and who doesn't?
[00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:38.140]   Why are we letting the government dictate so much of our lives?
[00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:39.140]   I don't think we should.
[00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:43.900]   It's shameful to discriminate against hardworking Americans who live in a higher cost of living
[00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:44.900]   area.
[00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:48.740]   The government should treat everyone equally and not pick and choose who gets to thrive
[00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:50.900]   and who gets to suffer.
[00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:55.940]   I am also a strong believer that each spouse should save and invest as independent man
[00:13:55.940 --> 00:14:02.580]   or woman because breakups happen all the time so it is imperative we count on ourselves
[00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:05.060]   in the worst case scenario.
[00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:09.740]   At the same time, there is no need to have double the property size presumably because
[00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:14.020]   a couple is sharing a room, a kitchen, a bathroom, a living room, a dining room, a garage, and
[00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:15.420]   a backyard.
[00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:19.340]   So let's take a look at the numbers for the financial samurai method.
[00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:23.660]   At age 30, net worth target $550,000.
[00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:26.100]   35, $900,000.
[00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:27.100]   Let's call it a million.
[00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:29.660]   40, $1.35 million.
[00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:32.340]   45, $1.7 million.
[00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:34.700]   50, $2.1 million.
[00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:37.260]   55, $2.7 million.
[00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.860]   60, $3.3 million.
[00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:42.680]   65, $4.1 million.
[00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:46.800]   In other words, the financial samurai is simply a hybrid method.
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:49.180]   We all know that equality is the right thing.
[00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:51.020]   One plus one equals two.
[00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:56.660]   But we also know that the government has tons and tons of data about all of us and our habits
[00:14:56.660 --> 00:15:03.780]   and everything and that they know how to optimize their budget and so there is obviously some
[00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:05.980]   credence to their method as well.
[00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:10.860]   So the financial samurai, we combine them and boom, we got these numbers here.
[00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:16.860]   And I think it's logical to look at these numbers and think, okay, that makes sense.
[00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:22.440]   Please remember that the above average couple net worth targets are based upon my assumptions
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:25.480]   for the above average person.
[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:30.200]   Not the average American who wakes up 10 years later hating his or her job because he or
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:34.380]   she forgot to save and invest all during this time.
[00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:39.220]   The average American who cannot come up with $1,000 to pay for an emergency is not the
[00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:42.240]   example you want to follow.
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:47.200]   If you haven't achieved my suggested net worth figures yet, don't worry.
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:51.860]   Just the fact that you're listening to this podcast means you're serious about supercharging
[00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:54.220]   your finances for a better life.
[00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:57.540]   Now you will have some clear financial goals as a couple.
[00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:01.080]   Give your savings and investments some time to compound.
[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:06.680]   Not only do couples have roughly a 70% higher combined net worth than single folks, life
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:10.360]   is also more enjoyable when spent with someone you love.
[00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:11.880]   Thanks so much everyone.
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:15.440]   And if you liked this podcast, please leave a positive review and share your thoughts
