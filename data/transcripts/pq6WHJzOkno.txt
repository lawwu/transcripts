[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.260]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.000]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.940]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.380]   Today, we are going to discuss
[00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:18.460]   the use of deliberate cold exposure
[00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.500]   for health and performance.
[00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.660]   Temperature is a powerful stimulus on our nervous system
[00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.780]   and indeed on every organ and system of our body.
[00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.060]   And cold in particular can be leveraged to improve
[00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.200]   mental health, physical health, and performance,
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.300]   meaning for endurance exercise,
[00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.180]   for recovering from various forms of exercise,
[00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.440]   for actually improving strength and power,
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.900]   and for enhancing mental capacity.
[00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.920]   In order to properly leverage deliberate cold exposure
[00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.260]   for sake of mental health, physical health, and performance,
[00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.220]   you have to understand how cold impacts the brain and body.
[00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.300]   So today we are going to discuss that.
[00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.040]   We're going to talk about some of the neural circuits
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.600]   and pathways, some of the hormones involved.
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.020]   I promise to make it all clear and accessible,
[00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.140]   regardless of whether or not
[00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.500]   you have a scientific background or not.
[00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.040]   We are also going to discuss very specific protocols
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.440]   that you can apply, which leverage variables
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.020]   like temperature, how cold, how to deliver the cold.
[00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.120]   For instance, whether or not you use a cold shower,
[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.940]   cold immersion, ice bath, circulating water, or still water,
[00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.860]   whether or not you're going for walks outside in a t-shirt
[00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.460]   when it's cold, or whether or not
[00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.100]   you're purposefully using things like cryo,
[00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.340]   if you have access to that or not.
[00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.660]   One thing I can promise you is that
[00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.520]   by the end of today's episode,
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.580]   you will know a lot about the biology of thermal regulation.
[00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.960]   That is how your brain and body regulates its temperature.
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.340]   You will also have a lot of tools in your arsenal
[00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.460]   that you can use and leverage toward
[00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.620]   improving mental health, physical health,
[00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.280]   reducing inflammation in the body,
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.180]   improving athletic performance,
[00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.820]   improving mental performance.
[00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.540]   I promise to spell out all those protocols in detail
[00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.480]   as I go along and to summarize them again at the end.
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.700]   I'd like to make a point now that I'm going to make
[00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.500]   several additional times during today's episode.
[00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.080]   And that is that temperature is a very potent stimulus
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.700]   for the brain and body.
[00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.360]   That also means that it carries certain hazards
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.100]   if it's not done correctly.
[00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.340]   Now, everyone shows up to the table, meaning to protocols,
[00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.380]   with a different background of health status.
[00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.140]   And there's simply no way that I can know
[00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.760]   what your health status is.
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.260]   So anytime you are going to take on a new protocol,
[00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.680]   that means a behavioral protocol or a nutritional protocol
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.460]   or a supplementation protocol,
[00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.580]   you should absolutely consult a board certified physician
[00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.060]   before initiating that protocol.
[00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.340]   I don't just say this to protect us.
[00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.660]   I also say this to protect you.
[00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.460]   If you'd like to see our medical disclaimer,
[00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:40.840]   you can go to our show notes.
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:41.680]   It's described there.
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.900]   In fact, I encourage you to please do that.
[00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.780]   And in general, when embarking on new protocols,
[00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.200]   in particular, if they involve strong stimuli,
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.240]   like changing temperature or placing yourself
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.680]   into unusual temperatures,
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.880]   I would encourage you to progress gradually.
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.740]   I would also encourage you to not look at gradual
[00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.040]   progression as the kind of weak version of a protocol.
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.660]   In fact, today I'm going to discuss a really beautiful
[00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.880]   peer-reviewed study that involved having people
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.380]   do deliberate cold exposure.
[00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.460]   So they were immersing themselves into water
[00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:13.660]   up to about their neck.
[00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.740]   And the water was actually not that cold.
[00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.540]   It was only about 60 degrees Fahrenheit,
[00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.420]   which for most people is pretty tolerable.
[00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.060]   So nowhere near the kinds of extreme temperatures
[00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.280]   that one could use in other protocols.
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.560]   And the interesting thing is,
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.960]   despite that fairly modest cold temperature,
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.880]   by simply extending the duration of time
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.380]   that people were in that water,
[00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.480]   they experienced enormous increases in neurochemicals
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.500]   that ought to translate to improvements in focus and mood.
[00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.620]   And indeed that's what's been observed
[00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.520]   in subsequent studies.
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.640]   So again, please see our medical disclaimer
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:47.760]   in our show notes.
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.740]   Please proceed with caution always.
[00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.600]   Please also understand that the most potent stimulus
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.500]   isn't always the one that you experience
[00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.240]   as the most intense in the moment.
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.420]   In fact, I would encourage you to find the minimum threshold
[00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.640]   of stimulus that will allow you to derive
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.320]   the maximum benefit from each protocol.
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.100]   And indeed, I will point out what those thresholds
[00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:10.540]   ought to be today.
[00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.440]   I'll give you some simple formulas,
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.620]   gauges or guides that you can use in order to navigate
[00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.360]   this extremely interesting and potent tool
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.480]   that we call deliberate cold exposure.
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.340]   Before we talk about deliberate cold exposure
[00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.860]   and its many powerful applications,
[00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.160]   I'd like to highlight a study
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.800]   that I find particularly interesting
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.400]   and that I think you will find particularly interesting
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.900]   and useful.
[00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.320]   The title of this study is Brief Aerobic Exercise
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.820]   Immediately Enhances Visual Attentional Control
[00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.440]   and Perceptual Speed,
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.440]   Testing the Mediating Role of Feelings of Energy.
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.880]   Now, the reason I like this study is first of all,
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.940]   it's a fairly large size sample group.
[00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.280]   They looked at 101 students.
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.720]   These were college age students and they had two groups.
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.720]   One group did 15 minutes of jogging at moderate intensity.
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.560]   So when they did measure percent heart rates, et cetera,
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.420]   but this would be analogous to zone two cardio,
[00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.380]   which I've discussed on this podcast before.
[00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.240]   Zone two cardio is cardiovascular exercise
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.360]   that places you at a level where you can hold
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.060]   a conversation with a little bit of strain,
[00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.440]   meaning that you can get the words out,
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.400]   but every once in a while, you have to catch your breath.
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.120]   Whereas if you were to push any harder
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.980]   by any mechanism going faster or on a steeper incline,
[00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:31.440]   et cetera, that you would have a hard time
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:32.800]   carrying out a conversation.
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.800]   So zone two cardio is a common form of describing
[00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.620]   that level of intensity that they call moderate intensity.
[00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:44.280]   So one group did 15 minutes of jogging at moderate intensity,
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.780]   which I'm translating to roughly zone two cardio.
[00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:52.000]   The other group did 15 minutes of relaxation concentration
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.400]   that is somewhat akin to mindfulness meditation.
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.960]   And then they were analyzed for perceptual speed,
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.680]   visual attentional control, something called working memory,
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.440]   which is your ability to keep certain batches
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.440]   of information online.
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.880]   Just imagine someone telling you their phone number
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.760]   and you have to remember that sequence of numbers
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.920]   in your head for some period of time,
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:13.940]   that's working memory.
[00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.300]   And it depends very heavily
[00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.960]   on the so-called prefrontal cortical networks,
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.960]   which are involved in planning and action.
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.100]   And they also looked at people's feelings of energy
[00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.420]   and they measured that subjectively,
[00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:26.060]   how energetic people felt.
[00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:27.980]   Now, the major takeaways from the study
[00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.920]   that I'd like to emphasize are that the 15 minutes
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:35.280]   of jogging group experienced elevated levels of energy
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.880]   for some period of time after they ceased the exercise.
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.760]   Whereas the group that did mindfulness meditation
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.120]   actually reported feeling more calm
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.720]   and having less overall energy.
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:47.860]   Now that's very subjective.
[00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:52.040]   And indeed they used subjective measures to analyze energy.
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:55.020]   But what gets interesting is when they looked at performance
[00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:57.340]   on these various cognitive tasks.
[00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.240]   And the two tasks that they use
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.320]   were called the trail making tests.
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.840]   They have different versions of this, version A, version B.
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.680]   I don't want to go into too much detail,
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:09.920]   but version A essentially involves having a page of numbers
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.860]   that are distributed somewhat randomly.
[00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:13.200]   So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.920]   and so on, but distributed randomly across the page.
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.540]   And people have to use visual search
[00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:19.480]   to circle those numbers in sequence.
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.120]   So this involves visual attention.
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.480]   It involves some motor skills.
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:24.380]   It involves a number of things
[00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:27.200]   that certainly require energy and focus.
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.280]   The second test was the trail making test part B,
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.200]   as I mentioned earlier.
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:34.000]   And this involved also circling numbers in sequence,
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.480]   but intersperse between those numbers were letters.
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:39.760]   So rather than just having to circle off numbers in sequence,
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:42.760]   they actually had to connect one, then the letter A,
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.360]   then two, then the letter B, et cetera.
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.400]   And remember these are randomly distributed across a page.
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:48.800]   The major takeaway from the study
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.760]   is that the group that did the 15 minutes
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:55.220]   of moderate exercise prior to these two tests
[00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:58.720]   showed significant decreases in the amount of time required
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.360]   to complete these tests accurately.
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:05.280]   That is interesting and indeed surprising, at least to me,
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.280]   because there have been many studies
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.200]   looking at the effects of mindfulness meditation
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.160]   on the ability to focus.
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.960]   The key variable in the study turned out to be energy,
[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:17.560]   this feeling, subjectively measured feeling, I should say,
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:20.820]   of having more energy and thereby the ability to focus,
[00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:23.720]   especially in these high cognitive demand tasks.
[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:25.440]   Now, the takeaway from this study for all of us,
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.280]   I think is pretty straightforward.
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:30.120]   If you are going to sit down to do some work
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.520]   that requires focus and working memory
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:33.600]   and cognitive attention,
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:36.800]   and especially if it's some visual spatial control,
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:38.420]   meaning you have to search for things on a page,
[00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:39.820]   you have to organize things on a page,
[00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:41.420]   so this would be writing, arithmetic,
[00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:44.640]   basically cognitive work of any kind,
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:49.540]   15 minutes of moderate exercise done prior to that workout
[00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:51.560]   could be very beneficial for you.
[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:53.900]   This does not mean that mindfulness meditation
[00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:55.400]   would not be of benefit to you.
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:57.200]   I wouldn't want you to conclude that,
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.900]   but if you had to choose between doing
[00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:00.840]   15 minutes of mindfulness meditation
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.800]   and doing 15 minutes of moderate exercise
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.640]   prior to a cognitive workout,
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.500]   I would say the 15 minutes of moderate exercise
[00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:09.920]   would be more valuable,
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:12.240]   at least based on the data in this paper.
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:14.360]   In many previous podcasts,
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:16.960]   I've talked about the powerful effects
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:19.700]   of doing things like mindfulness meditation
[00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:22.960]   and other forms of NSDR, non-sleep deep breaths,
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:24.460]   so these could be 20 minute naps
[00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:26.660]   or just lying there quietly with your eyes closed,
[00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:31.460]   or yoga nidra, or NSDR scripts are available on YouTube
[00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:34.620]   and various other places free of cost of any kind,
[00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:35.460]   you can just go to YouTube,
[00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:37.640]   put in NSDR, non-sleep deep rest.
[00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:41.500]   Those protocols have been shown to be very beneficial
[00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:43.860]   for enhancing neuroplasticity,
[00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:47.080]   the changes in the brain and body that encode
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:51.660]   or shift the neural circuits that allow for memory to change
[00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:55.720]   that allow for learning to occur after a learning bout.
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.460]   What I'm referring to today in this particular study
[00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:00.800]   is the use of moderate exercise
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.920]   in order to increase one's focus and attention
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:06.760]   in order to trigger that neuroplasticity.
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:11.200]   So the simple sequence here is get energetic and alert,
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:14.160]   do that prior to the learning bout,
[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.320]   engage in the cognitive work or learning bout,
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:18.840]   and then mindfulness meditation, NSDR,
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:20.660]   and so forth should follow.
[00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:23.120]   And if you would like to access this paper
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:25.540]   and like to look more at the details in the paper,
[00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:27.240]   we'll be sure to put a link in the show notes.
[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:29.180]   The first author is Legrand.
[00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:30.580]   And again, the title of this paper is
[00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:32.620]   "Brief Aerobic Exercise Immediately Enhances
[00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:34.940]   Visual Potential Control and Perceptual Speed,
[00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:37.480]   Testing the Mediating Role of Feelings of Energy."
[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:40.060]   And I also just want to emphasize immediately,
[00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:42.100]   I think most people out there are interested in tools
[00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:43.860]   and protocols that work the first time
[00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:44.980]   and that work every time.
[00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:47.720]   And indeed, I think this protocol fits that bill.
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:49.220]   I'm pleased to announce that I'm hosting
[00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:51.380]   two live events this May.
[00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:52.900]   The first live event will be hosted
[00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:55.580]   in Seattle, Washington on May 17th.
[00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:57.200]   The second live event will be hosted
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.580]   in Portland, Oregon on May 18th.
[00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:01.520]   Both are part of a lecture series entitled
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:03.180]   "The Brain-Body Contract,"
[00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:04.900]   during which I will discuss science
[00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:07.060]   and science-based tools for mental health,
[00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:08.860]   physical health, and performance.
[00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:11.300]   And I should point out that while some of the material
[00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:13.960]   I'll cover will overlap with information covered here
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:15.580]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:17.420]   and on various social media posts,
[00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:20.580]   most of the information I will cover is going to be distinct
[00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:23.460]   from information covered on the podcast or elsewhere.
[00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:25.980]   So once again, it's Seattle on May 17th,
[00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:27.340]   Portland on May 18th.
[00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:31.460]   You can access tickets by going to HubermanLab.com/tour,
[00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:32.900]   and I hope to see you there.
[00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:35.460]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:38.280]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:40.380]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:43.100]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:45.780]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:46.940]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:49.700]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:53.620]   Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens, also called AG1.
[00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:56.540]   I started taking AG1 way back in 2012,
[00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:58.980]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:00.660]   The reason I started taking AG1
[00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:03.700]   and the reason I still take AG1 once or twice a day
[00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:06.380]   is that it covers my foundational vitamin, mineral,
[00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:07.820]   and probiotic needs.
[00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:10.260]   It also has adaptogens and things like zinc
[00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:11.980]   for immune system function,
[00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:14.740]   but the probiotics are one of the key features in there.
[00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:17.060]   I've done several podcasts on the gut microbiome,
[00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:18.900]   which are these trillions of microbiota
[00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:20.340]   that live in our digestive tract
[00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:22.360]   and that are crucial for our immune system,
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:23.780]   brain function, and so on.
[00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:26.940]   One way to enhance our gut microbiome
[00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:28.180]   to ensure that it's healthy
[00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:31.100]   is to make sure that we get the correct probiotics.
[00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:33.620]   And Athletic Greens has the correct prebiotics
[00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:36.920]   and probiotics that ensure a healthy gut microbiome.
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:38.380]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:41.180]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:42.500]   to claim a special offer.
[00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:44.020]   They'll give you five free travel packs
[00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:46.080]   that make it very easy to mix up Athletic Greens
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:48.460]   while you're on the road, so in the car and on the plane.
[00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:50.360]   I should mention that Athletic Greens is delicious.
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:51.200]   I love the way it tastes.
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:52.260]   I mix mine with some water
[00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:53.780]   and a little bit of lemon or lime juice.
[00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:55.980]   The special offer is the five free travel packs
[00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:58.880]   plus a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:00.900]   Vitamin D3 has been shown to be important
[00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:03.380]   for a tremendous number of biological functions.
[00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:06.800]   Many of us who get sunlight get enough vitamin D3.
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:08.880]   Many of us, even if we do get sunlight,
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:10.820]   do not get enough vitamin D3.
[00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:13.820]   So the year's supply of vitamin D3 also has K2,
[00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:15.700]   which is important for cardiovascular function,
[00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:17.360]   for calcium regulation.
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:20.020]   Again, go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:21.380]   to get the five free travel packs
[00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:24.020]   and the year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:26.360]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Roca.
[00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:28.480]   Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:30.500]   that are of the absolute highest quality.
[00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:32.460]   The company was founded by two all-American swimmers
[00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:34.820]   from Stanford, and everything about their eyeglasses
[00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:38.560]   and sunglasses were designed with performance in mind.
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:40.100]   Now, the glasses were initially designed
[00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:41.140]   for athletic performance,
[00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:42.540]   meaning they were designed to be worn
[00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:43.940]   while cycling or running,
[00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:46.140]   and indeed you can wear them while cycling or running.
[00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:47.840]   If you get sweaty, they won't slip off your face.
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:48.680]   They're very lightweight.
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:50.880]   In fact, you hardly ever remember that they're on your face.
[00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:52.840]   At least I can't remember that they're on my face.
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:54.700]   I wear the sunglasses when I drive.
[00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:56.140]   I wear readers at night,
[00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:58.220]   but they're not just for athletic performance.
[00:13:58.220 --> 00:13:59.640]   They have a terrific aesthetic,
[00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:02.340]   so you could wear them to the office or to work or to school.
[00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:03.180]   They look great.
[00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:04.940]   Unlike a lot of high-performance sunglasses out there
[00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:06.160]   that make people look like cyborgs,
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.180]   these you would be happy to wear anywhere.
[00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:09.700]   If you'd like to try Roca glasses,
[00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:12.920]   you can go to roca.com, that's R-O-K-A.com,
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:16.720]   and enter the code Huberman to save 20% off your first order.
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:19.220]   Again, that's Roca, R-O-K-A.com,
[00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:21.200]   and enter the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:24.000]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.120]   Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:29.040]   that are uniquely designed to your sleep needs.
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:31.320]   Everybody knows the importance of sleep for mental health,
[00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:33.160]   physical health, and performance,
[00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.240]   but probably what everyone doesn't realize
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:37.620]   is that you have unique sleep needs.
[00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:40.100]   Your body, and indeed the way you sleep,
[00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:41.680]   need to be matched to the correct mattress
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:43.720]   in order to get the best possible sleep.
[00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:46.680]   Helix understands that, and if you go to their website,
[00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:49.220]   they have a brief two-minute quiz that anyone can take
[00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:51.520]   that will match your body type and sleep preferences
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:53.420]   to the perfect mattress for you.
[00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:55.260]   So they ask questions like, do you sleep on your side,
[00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:56.840]   your back, or your stomach, or maybe you don't know,
[00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:58.380]   do you tend to run hot or cold through the night,
[00:14:58.380 --> 00:14:59.640]   or maybe you don't know.
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:02.120]   I matched to the Dusk mattress, D-U-S-K,
[00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:04.200]   because I wanted a mattress that wasn't too firm
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:06.080]   nor too soft, and I've been sleeping on that mattress
[00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:07.320]   for over a year now.
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:09.000]   It's the best sleep I've ever had.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.740]   So if you're interested in upgrading your mattress,
[00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:13.260]   go to helixsleep.com/huberman,
[00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:14.720]   take their two-minute sleep quiz,
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:16.720]   and they'll match you to a customized mattress,
[00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:19.660]   and you'll get up to $200 off any mattress order
[00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:20.940]   and two free pillows.
[00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:22.180]   They have a 10-year warranty,
[00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:24.120]   and you get to try the mattress out
[00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:26.020]   for 100 nights risk-free.
[00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:27.580]   They'll even pick it up for you if you don't like it,
[00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:28.940]   although I think you will like it.
[00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:30.140]   I certainly love mine.
[00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:31.180]   Again, if you're interested,
[00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:33.420]   go to helixsleep.com/huberman
[00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:35.880]   to get up to $200 off your mattress order
[00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:37.260]   and two free pillows.
[00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:38.860]   Okay, let's talk about the use of cold
[00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:40.540]   for health and performance.
[00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:42.480]   I confess I love this topic
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:45.580]   because it takes me back to my undergraduate years
[00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:49.540]   when I worked in a laboratory studying cold physiology,
[00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:52.620]   its effects on the brain and its effects on the body.
[00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:53.980]   And over the years,
[00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:56.740]   I've always kept track of the literature in this area,
[00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:59.780]   and indeed there have been some tremendous discoveries,
[00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:02.780]   both in animal models, so in rodents like mice and rats,
[00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:04.540]   but also in humans.
[00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:06.080]   And today we're going to talk about
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:07.740]   both categories of studies,
[00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:09.460]   and I will be careful to point out
[00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:11.880]   when discoveries were made in animal models
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:14.140]   and when they were made in humans.
[00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:19.740]   A key point when thinking about the use of cold as a tool,
[00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:21.820]   and the key point is
[00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:25.080]   that you have a baseline level of temperature
[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:29.440]   that is varying, changing across the 24-hour cycle.
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:32.220]   So any use of deliberate cold exposure
[00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:36.120]   is going to be superimposed on that rhythm,
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:40.380]   that circadian rhythm, meaning that 24-hour rhythm.
[00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:44.700]   The basic contour of your circadian rhythm in temperature
[00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:49.520]   is that approximately two hours before the time you wake up
[00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:51.880]   is your so-called temperature minimum.
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:54.360]   So your temperature minimum is a time
[00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:56.140]   within the 24-hour cycle
[00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:59.860]   when your body temperature is at its lowest, okay?
[00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:03.200]   So if you normally wake up around 6 a.m.,
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:07.380]   your temperature minimum is probably about 4 a.m.
[00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:09.960]   If you normally wake up at about 7 a.m.,
[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:13.140]   your temperature minimum is probably about 5 a.m.
[00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:16.180]   It's not exactly two hours before your wake-up time,
[00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:19.220]   it's approximately two hours before your wake-up time.
[00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:22.660]   Now, as you go from your temperature minimum
[00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:25.060]   to the time in which you are going to awake,
[00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:27.940]   your temperature is rising slightly.
[00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:30.380]   And then at the point where you wake up,
[00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:33.280]   your temperature starts to go up more sharply
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:35.800]   and will continue to go up into the early
[00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:38.560]   and sometimes even into the late afternoon.
[00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:41.320]   And then sometime in the late afternoon and evening,
[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:44.700]   your temperature will start to decline.
[00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:46.680]   And indeed, as you approach sleep,
[00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:48.180]   your body temperature will drop
[00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:50.720]   by anywhere from one to three degrees.
[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:53.940]   And in fact, that decrease in core body temperature
[00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:55.660]   is important, if not essential,
[00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:58.940]   for getting into and staying in deep sleep, okay?
[00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:02.780]   So temperature rises with waking, that's easy to remember.
[00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:05.540]   It tends to continue to rise throughout the day.
[00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:07.260]   And in the late afternoon and evening,
[00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:09.500]   your temperature will start to go down
[00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:13.820]   and the drop in temperature actually helps you access sleep.
[00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:18.220]   That background, or what we call baseline circadian rhythm
[00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:21.140]   in core body temperature is important to remember
[00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:24.260]   because it helps us frame both the effects
[00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:26.340]   of deliberate cold exposure
[00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:29.620]   and it helps us frame when you might want
[00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:31.060]   to use deliberate cold exposure
[00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:33.540]   in order to access specific states.
[00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:36.700]   It also points to times within the 24 hour cycle
[00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:39.780]   when you might want to avoid using deliberate cold exposure
[00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:42.480]   if your primary goal is to get to sleep.
[00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:45.540]   Okay, so that's the circadian rhythm in temperature.
[00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:48.780]   Now I just briefly want to touch on thermal regulation
[00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:51.060]   at the level of the body and the brain.
[00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:54.160]   And this will be very surprising to many of you.
[00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:57.460]   Let's do what's called a Gedanken experiment,
[00:18:57.460 --> 00:18:58.920]   which is a thought experiment.
[00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:01.880]   Let's say I send you out into the desert heat
[00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:05.220]   for a jog or a run, and it's very hot outside,
[00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:08.680]   you know, 102 degrees or 103 degrees.
[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:12.220]   And you start to move, you start to sweat,
[00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:14.860]   and of course your core body temperature goes up.
[00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:18.840]   Now, then I offer you a cold towel,
[00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:21.060]   maybe a really, really cold towel,
[00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:22.820]   and this towel is saturated with water
[00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:24.700]   so you could actually squeeze the water out of that
[00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:26.320]   and cool your body off.
[00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:28.760]   And our Gedanken experiment is for me to say,
[00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:31.440]   okay, where are you going to place the towel?
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:33.780]   How are you going to cool yourself off?
[00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:35.860]   And I'm guessing that most of you would think
[00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:37.560]   that the best way to cool yourself off
[00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:39.500]   would be to drape that towel over your head,
[00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:42.000]   maybe your neck, over your torso,
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.280]   that it would feel really, really good
[00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:45.340]   and they would cool you off.
[00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:48.220]   Well, that's exactly the wrong approach
[00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:49.300]   if you want to cool off.
[00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:52.080]   And in fact, if you were to use that approach,
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:56.580]   your body temperature would continue to increase even more,
[00:19:56.580 --> 00:20:00.300]   yes, even more than had you not placed that cold towel
[00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:02.540]   on your head or your torso.
[00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:04.440]   And here is why.
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:07.380]   Thermal regulation, meaning your brain and body's ability
[00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:10.920]   to regulate your internal core temperature
[00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:12.500]   is somewhat like a thermostat,
[00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:15.140]   and that thermostat resides in your brain.
[00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:16.620]   So if you think about the thermostat
[00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:18.640]   in your home or apartment,
[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:22.540]   if it's too warm in your home or apartment,
[00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:24.820]   and you were to take a bag of ice
[00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:27.600]   and to put it on that thermostat,
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:29.060]   what would the thermostat do?
[00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:32.620]   It would register the environment as artificially cool.
[00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:34.640]   It would think that the environment
[00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:37.940]   was actually much colder than it is.
[00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:41.000]   And so as a consequence, it would trigger a mechanism
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.500]   to further increase the temperature in the room.
[00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:45.500]   And you have such a thermostat as well.
[00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:48.500]   It's called the medial preoptic area of the hypothalamus,
[00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:52.140]   the hypothalamus is a small region of brain tissue
[00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:54.060]   about over the roof of your mouth
[00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:56.180]   and a little bit in front of that.
[00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:59.500]   So it's basically right behind your nose
[00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:01.200]   and over the roof of your mouth,
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:02.620]   and it's a collection of neurons.
[00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:04.520]   Those neurons have a lot of different functions
[00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:07.500]   that include things like the control of aggression,
[00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:09.200]   the control of sex behavior,
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:11.680]   the control of temperature regulation, and so on.
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:14.960]   The medial preoptic area has connections
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:17.240]   with the rest of the brain
[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:19.060]   or areas within the brain, I should say,
[00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:21.460]   and with many areas within the body,
[00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:26.100]   it receives input from receptors in our skin
[00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:29.560]   and inside our body that register temperature,
[00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:31.280]   and it acts as a thermostat.
[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:34.540]   So if the surface of your body is made cool,
[00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:38.380]   your medial preoptic area will send signals
[00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:41.700]   by way of hormones and by way of chemicals
[00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:44.620]   that will serve to heat your body up.
[00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:47.220]   So what this means is that if you want to cool down,
[00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:48.980]   the last thing you want to do
[00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:52.780]   is to bring a cold surface of any kind,
[00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:54.560]   towel or splashing water,
[00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:57.180]   to the majority of your body surface.
[00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:59.060]   It might be very, very surprising to you,
[00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:00.880]   and you might say, wait, if I want to cool down,
[00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:02.940]   I should jump into a cold lake or something of that sort.
[00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:05.500]   That's a different thing altogether.
[00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:06.480]   What I'll tell you,
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:08.280]   and we'll get into this in more depth later,
[00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:09.900]   is that if you really want to cool down
[00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:11.320]   quickly and efficiently,
[00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:14.780]   you should leverage particular portals,
[00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:18.160]   meaning particular sites on your body
[00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:21.660]   where heat can leave your body more readily
[00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:26.100]   and where cooling can have a dramatic and fast impact
[00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:27.160]   on your core body temperature.
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:29.400]   It can even save your life if you're going hyperthermic.
[00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:31.940]   We're going to talk more about the specific protocols
[00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:34.620]   to reduce core body temperature for sake of performance
[00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:37.500]   and avoiding hyperthermia later in the episode.
[00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:40.580]   Hyperthermia, of course, is a very, very dangerous situation
[00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:43.220]   because while your body can drop in core temperature
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:45.820]   somewhat and still be safe,
[00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:48.440]   you can't really increase your body temperature that much
[00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:50.020]   before your brain starts to cook
[00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:51.400]   and other organs start to cook.
[00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:54.140]   And by cook, I mean, the cells actually start to die.
[00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:56.900]   So you have to be very, very careful with the use of heat.
[00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:58.420]   Heat stroke is no joke.
[00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:00.260]   People die from heat stroke all the time.
[00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:02.340]   You really want to avoid that.
[00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:03.740]   One way to avoid that
[00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:07.540]   is to cool the appropriate surfaces of your body.
[00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:10.020]   And the appropriate surfaces in this case
[00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:11.860]   are the upper cheeks,
[00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:14.520]   or I would say the upper half of the face,
[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:16.480]   the palms of your hands, and the bottoms of your feet.
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:18.560]   I've talked about this on the podcast before
[00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:20.900]   and in the guest episode with Dr. Craig Heller,
[00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:23.840]   my colleague in the biology department at Stanford.
[00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:26.480]   But just very briefly, these surfaces,
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:28.340]   the upper half of the face,
[00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:31.080]   the palms of the hands and the bottoms of the feet
[00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:34.940]   are what we call glabrous skin surfaces,
[00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:38.340]   G-L-A-B-R-O-U-S, glabrous.
[00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:40.980]   And those surfaces are unique
[00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:42.660]   in that just below them,
[00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:46.100]   the vasculature is different than elsewhere in the body.
[00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:47.560]   Normally, the passage of blood
[00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:50.620]   goes from arteries to capillaries to veins,
[00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:53.860]   but just beneath the glabrous skin
[00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:54.700]   on the bottoms of the feet,
[00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:56.240]   the hands and the upper half of the face,
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:59.940]   you have what are called arteriovenous astomoses.
[00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:02.220]   These are portals of blood
[00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:04.140]   that go directly from arteries to veins.
[00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:07.080]   And in doing so, allow the body
[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:10.700]   to dump heat more readily, more quickly.
[00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:13.080]   So as it turns out,
[00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:15.640]   that if you are to cool the palms of the hands,
[00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:17.440]   the bottoms of the feet and the upper half of the face,
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:20.640]   you can more efficiently reduce core body temperature
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:23.160]   for sake of offsetting hyperthermia
[00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:25.380]   and for improving athletic performance
[00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:27.280]   and maybe even cognitive performance.
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:29.120]   So we will return to the specific protocols
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:31.240]   for doing that later in the episode.
[00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:34.100]   I'll give you a lot of details about how to do that,
[00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:36.520]   how to do that without the use of any fancy
[00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:38.240]   or expensive technology.
[00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:39.360]   There are some technologies
[00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:41.400]   that are now commercially available.
[00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:43.000]   For instance, the so-called cool-mit
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.160]   that will allow you to do that with maximum efficiency,
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:48.560]   but I'll also give you some at-home methods to do this
[00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:51.640]   either in the gym or on runs or for sake of cognitive work.
[00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:54.200]   Okay, so the two key themes, again,
[00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:58.480]   are understand that baseline circadian rhythm in temperature
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:01.720]   and understand that the best way to cool the body
[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:06.720]   is going to be by making sure that something cold contacts
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:09.520]   the bottoms of your feet, the palms of your hands
[00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:10.480]   and the upper half of the face.
[00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:11.860]   Ideally all three if your goal
[00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:13.880]   is to lower core body temperature quickly.
[00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:17.120]   And again, just cooling off the back of your neck
[00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:19.360]   or the top of your head or your torso with a towel
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:21.360]   is going to be the least efficient way
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:22.920]   to lower core body temperature
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:25.780]   and might even increase body temperature
[00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:27.040]   under certain conditions.
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:28.840]   Okay, with those two points in mind,
[00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:30.080]   we can start to think about
[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:32.640]   directed deliberate cold exposure protocols.
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:34.740]   And there are a number of different reasons
[00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:36.800]   to use deliberate cold exposure.
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:38.840]   And I want to separate those out for you.
[00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:42.820]   There are cold protocols that have been tested
[00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:44.040]   in peer-reviewed studies
[00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:47.120]   that are designed to improve mental performance.
[00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:49.820]   They are designed to improve things like resilience
[00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:52.520]   or your grittiness or your ability to move through challenge
[00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:56.280]   or to regulate your mind and your internal state
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:57.800]   under conditions of stress.
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:00.280]   And we can define stress very specifically
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:03.800]   as times when adrenaline also called epinephrine
[00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:09.240]   and or norepinephrine also called noradrenaline
[00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:10.560]   are elevated in your body.
[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:13.460]   Forgive me for the noradrenaline, norepinephrine,
[00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:15.240]   adrenaline, epinephrine nomenclature.
[00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:16.480]   I didn't make that up.
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:19.040]   It turns out that every once in a while scientists disagree.
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:20.060]   Imagine that.
[00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:21.760]   And you'll get multiple scientists
[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:23.560]   naming the same molecule different things.
[00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:26.600]   Okay, so epinephrine and adrenaline are the same thing.
[00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:28.320]   I will use them interchangeably.
[00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:31.200]   Norepinephrine and noradrenaline are the same thing.
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:34.360]   I will use those terms interchangeably.
[00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:37.120]   Noradrenaline and adrenaline are often co-released
[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:38.080]   in the brain and body.
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:40.560]   So they work as kind of a pair
[00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:44.080]   to increase our level of agitation, our level of focus
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:47.400]   and our desire and our ability to move.
[00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:50.440]   They are often co-released from different sites
[00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:52.840]   in the brain and body with dopamine,
[00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:56.680]   a molecule that is commonly misunderstood
[00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:58.000]   as the molecule of pleasure,
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.320]   but is actually the molecule of motivation,
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:02.720]   reward and pursuit.
[00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:04.920]   So dopamine, norepinephrine and noradrenaline
[00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:08.180]   tend to be released together under certain conditions.
[00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:11.160]   And today you will learn how deliberate cold exposure
[00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:15.280]   can be used to cause increases in the release of several,
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:17.820]   if not all of these in ways that can improve
[00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:20.960]   your levels of attention and your mood.
[00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:25.960]   But the key point is that your mental state is shifted
[00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:29.800]   when you are exposed to certain forms of cold.
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:33.340]   And many people use deliberate cold exposure specifically
[00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:36.160]   to shift their body state as a way to train
[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:38.900]   their mental state so that they can better cope
[00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:40.440]   with stress in real life.
[00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:41.840]   And by real life, I mean,
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:43.880]   when life presents stressful events.
[00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:45.760]   And I will give you specific protocols
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:47.140]   as to how you can do that.
[00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:49.640]   In other words, how you can become more resilient
[00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:52.160]   through the use of deliberate cold exposure.
[00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:55.400]   Now, because of the ways in which deliberate cold exposure
[00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:57.800]   can increase this category of chemicals
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:58.880]   called the catecholamines,
[00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:01.680]   that includes dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine.
[00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:05.840]   It can also be used to elevate mood
[00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:07.720]   for long periods of time.
[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:10.080]   And I'm going to discuss a specific protocol
[00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:13.040]   that has been shown to increase these chemicals
[00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:18.040]   anywhere from 2.5 X, so 250% to as high as 500%
[00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:23.040]   five times over baseline.
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:26.300]   Now you might be asking whether or not it's a good thing
[00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:29.140]   to raise chemicals like norepinephrine and dopamine
[00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:31.140]   to such a great degree,
[00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:32.460]   whether or not that's healthy for us,
[00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:34.060]   whether or not they can harm us.
[00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:36.020]   But it turns out that these elevations
[00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:39.000]   in norepinephrine and dopamine are very long lasting
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.060]   in ways that people report feeling vast improvements
[00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:45.140]   in mood and vast improvements
[00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:47.660]   in levels of cognitive attention
[00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:48.720]   and energy.
[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:50.880]   So by my read of the literature,
[00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:52.980]   these seem to be healthy increases
[00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:56.520]   in our baseline levels of these chemicals
[00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:57.720]   in ways that can really support us.
[00:28:57.720 --> 00:28:59.760]   So I'll give you a protocol for that.
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:01.720]   Now, those are some of the mental effects
[00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:03.200]   of deliberate cold exposure.
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:05.460]   But deliberate cold exposure has also been studied
[00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:07.000]   in animal models and in humans
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.840]   in the context of increasing metabolism.
[00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:12.940]   Even in converting certain fat cells
[00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:14.280]   that we call white fat cells,
[00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:16.080]   which are the ones where energy is stored,
[00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:19.440]   the ones that we typically think of as kind of blubbery fat,
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:23.280]   to beige or brown fat, which is thermogenic fat,
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:25.380]   meaning that it can increase core body temperature
[00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:27.640]   and serves as kind of the furnace
[00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:31.000]   by which we increase our core metabolism.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.160]   So with a very broad stroke,
[00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:35.620]   I can say that white fat is generally the kind of fat
[00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:37.060]   that people want less of,
[00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:40.140]   and beige fat and brown fat is generally the kind of fat
[00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:42.540]   that if you're going to have fat cells
[00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:45.300]   and you certainly need fat cells that you want more of,
[00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:47.560]   they are thermogenic, they help you stay lean,
[00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:50.080]   they actually serve as a reservoir for heating your body up
[00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:52.140]   if you're ever confronted with a cold challenge.
[00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:53.920]   So we're going to talk about how to use cold
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:55.540]   for metabolism as well.
[00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:57.920]   And of course, people are using deliberate cold exposure
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:29:59.960]   to reduce inflammation post-exercise,
[00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:01.840]   to reduce inflammation generally.
[00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:06.520]   And people are also using cold to enhance performance
[00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:08.520]   in the context of strength training,
[00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:10.120]   in the context of endurance training,
[00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:12.440]   and we'll talk about those data as well.
[00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:14.920]   But where I'd like to start is with mental performance.
[00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:18.280]   And I'd like to detail what happens
[00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:21.420]   when we deliberately expose ourselves to cold.
[00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:24.600]   It's key to point out the word deliberate.
[00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:27.600]   If I don't say otherwise, then throughout this episode,
[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:30.720]   if I say cold exposure, I mean deliberate cold exposure.
[00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:32.140]   And the reason I point that out
[00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:33.680]   is that as my colleague David Spiegel
[00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:36.120]   in the Department of Psychiatry at Stanford says,
[00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:38.560]   it's not just about the state that we are in,
[00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:39.940]   it's about the state that we are in
[00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:41.720]   and whether or not we had anything to do
[00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:43.880]   with placing ourselves into that state
[00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:45.880]   and whether or not we did that on purpose or not.
[00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:48.680]   And what he really means by that statement
[00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:53.080]   is that there are important effects of what we call mindset.
[00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:56.340]   Mindset was a topic discussed in the guest episode
[00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:58.620]   with Ali Krum some weeks ago.
[00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:01.220]   If you haven't seen that episode, I highly recommend it.
[00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:03.400]   And the science of mindset tells us
[00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:06.180]   that if we are doing something deliberately
[00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:08.600]   and we believe that it's going to be good for us,
[00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:11.400]   it actually can lead to a different set
[00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:15.720]   of physiological effects than if something is happening
[00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:18.800]   to us against our will or without our control.
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:20.600]   Now, this is different than placebo effects.
[00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:23.880]   Placebo effects are distinct from mindset effects.
[00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:25.320]   If you want to learn more about the distinction,
[00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:27.240]   please see the episode with Ali Krum.
[00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:30.320]   But again, when I talk about cold exposure in this episode,
[00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:33.240]   I'm talking about deliberate cold exposure,
[00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:35.260]   meaning that you are placing yourself
[00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:37.680]   into a cold environment on purpose
[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:40.920]   in order to extract a particular set of benefits.
[00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:44.960]   When we talk about deliberate cold exposure,
[00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:48.080]   almost always that means getting uncomfortable.
[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:50.040]   And one of the most common questions I get
[00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:51.880]   when discussing the use of cold
[00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:53.440]   for sake of mental or physical performance,
[00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:57.320]   metabolism, et cetera, is how cold should it be?
[00:31:57.320 --> 00:31:58.440]   How cold should the water be?
[00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:00.900]   How cold should the environment be?
[00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:02.280]   And I just will tell you now,
[00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:03.720]   and I'm going to say this again and again
[00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:04.560]   throughout the episode,
[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:06.820]   'cause it will continue to be true throughout the episode
[00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:08.560]   and long after the episode is over,
[00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:12.820]   how cold depends on your cold tolerance,
[00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:15.920]   your core metabolism, and a number of other features
[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:20.440]   that there is simply no way I could know or have access to.
[00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:22.880]   So I would like you to use this rule of thumb.
[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:27.340]   If you are using deliberate cold exposure,
[00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:30.760]   the environment that you place yourself into
[00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:33.260]   should place your mind into a state of,
[00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:36.800]   "Whoa, I would really like to get out of this environment,
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:39.240]   but I can stay in safely."
[00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:41.220]   Okay, now that might seem a little bit arbitrary,
[00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:43.560]   but let's say you were to get into a warm shower
[00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:45.140]   and it would feel really, really nice,
[00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:47.080]   and you were to start turning down the warm
[00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:48.360]   and turning up the cold,
[00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:49.700]   there would be some threshold
[00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:52.560]   at which it would feel uncomfortable to you.
[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:53.700]   And if you were to continue
[00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:55.540]   to make a little bit colder than that,
[00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:57.600]   you would really want to get out of the shower,
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:00.120]   but you were confident that you could stay in
[00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:02.560]   without risking your health, right?
[00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:04.040]   Without risking a heart attack.
[00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:05.080]   Now that's very different
[00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:07.820]   than jumping into a very, very cold lake
[00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:10.560]   or I've seen these images of people
[00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:13.720]   that will cut holes into frozen over lakes
[00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:16.000]   and they'll get into that cold water.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.200]   If you are trained to do that
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:19.120]   and you have the right conditions, et cetera,
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:21.240]   that can be done reasonably safely,
[00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:23.740]   but that's certainly not what I would start with.
[00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:25.540]   And for many people, that will be too cold.
[00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:28.640]   And indeed, some people can go into cold shock
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:30.140]   and can die as a consequence of getting
[00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:32.200]   to that extremely cold water very quickly.
[00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:33.400]   Now that's not to scare you away
[00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:34.840]   from deliberate cold exposure.
[00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:38.260]   It's just to say that there's no simple prescriptive
[00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:39.820]   of how cold to make the environment
[00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:43.220]   in order to extract maximum benefit
[00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:46.220]   for mental or physical performance.
[00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:49.220]   So the simple rule of thumb is going to be
[00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:51.120]   place yourself into an environment
[00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:53.540]   that is uncomfortably cold,
[00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:55.260]   but that you can stay in safely, okay?
[00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:56.380]   And you'll have to experiment a bit.
[00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:57.940]   And that number,
[00:33:57.940 --> 00:34:00.180]   meaning that temperature will vary from day to day.
[00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:03.420]   It will vary across the 24 hour cycle
[00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:06.880]   because of that endogenous, meaning that internal rhythm
[00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:09.200]   in temperature that I talked about earlier.
[00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:10.620]   Low early in the day rises
[00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:12.440]   into the afternoon drops at night.
[00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:14.860]   You can actually do this experiment if you like.
[00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:17.680]   Try getting into a cold shower at 11 o'clock at night
[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:20.480]   if you want versus try doing it
[00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:21.980]   in the middle of the afternoon.
[00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:24.240]   It's quite a different experience.
[00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:25.580]   And by quite a different experience,
[00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:29.580]   I mean it requires quite a different degree of resilience
[00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:31.060]   and leaning into the practice.
[00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:35.620]   Your willpower will have to be higher, I suspect,
[00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:39.800]   late in the day as compared to early in the day.
[00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:42.700]   But that will vary, of course, between individuals as well.
[00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:43.940]   So the most common question I get
[00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:45.260]   about deliberate cold exposure
[00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:48.060]   is how cold should the water be?
[00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:50.820]   And we've answered that with uncomfortably cold
[00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:51.920]   to the point where you want to get out,
[00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:53.780]   but you can safely stay in.
[00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:55.460]   The second most common question I get
[00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:57.120]   about deliberate cold exposure
[00:34:57.120 --> 00:35:00.140]   is whether or not cold showers are as good, better,
[00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:03.420]   or worse than cold water immersion up to the neck.
[00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:05.400]   For instance, I also get a lot of questions
[00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:07.300]   about whether or not cryo chambers
[00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:10.260]   are better than all the others, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:12.700]   I'm going to make all of that very simple for you
[00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:15.580]   by saying cold water immersion up to the neck
[00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:18.220]   with your feet and hands submerged also
[00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:20.040]   is going to be the most effective.
[00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:23.700]   Second best would be cold shower.
[00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:26.020]   Third best would be to go outside
[00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:28.720]   with a minimum amount of clothing,
[00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:32.060]   but of course, clothing that is culturally appropriate
[00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:35.100]   and that would allow you to experience cold
[00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:37.040]   to the point where you would almost want to shiver
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:38.420]   or start shivering.
[00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:41.340]   Now, there are a number of different important constraints
[00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:42.800]   that are going to dictate whether or not
[00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:45.380]   you use one form of cold exposure or the other.
[00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:46.980]   For instance, some people don't have access
[00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:48.000]   to cold water immersion.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   They don't have access to ice baths or cold water tanks,
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.180]   cold ocean or cold lakes, et cetera.
[00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:58.760]   In that case, showers would be the next best solution.
[00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:01.180]   I do want to emphasize that there have been very few,
[00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:04.360]   if any, studies of cold showers.
[00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:07.200]   And you can imagine why this would be the case.
[00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:08.600]   In a laboratory, you want to control
[00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:10.960]   for as many variables as possible.
[00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:15.440]   So placing people into a cold water immersion
[00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:17.260]   or an ice bath up to the neck and insisting
[00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:19.400]   that they keep their hands and feet under
[00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:21.240]   is very easy to control.
[00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:23.580]   It means that everyone can do essentially the same thing,
[00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:27.280]   whereas with cold showers, people are different sized bodies.
[00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:28.580]   Some people are going to put their head under,
[00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:31.240]   some people are going to lean forward.
[00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:33.480]   Measuring the amount of cold water exposure
[00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:35.080]   on the body is very hard to do.
[00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:38.240]   And so there aren't a lot of studies of cold showers,
[00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:40.560]   but of course, a lot of people don't have access
[00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:43.400]   to cold water immersion, so they have to use cold showers.
[00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:45.400]   And if you don't have access to both, of course,
[00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:49.520]   then going outside on a cold day can be of benefit.
[00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:53.400]   But I will point out that the heat transfer
[00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:56.980]   from your body into water is much higher,
[00:36:56.980 --> 00:37:00.720]   four times greater, if not even greater,
[00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:02.400]   depending on the temperature of the water,
[00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:04.360]   in water as opposed to in air.
[00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:05.900]   So it's going to be much more efficient
[00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:07.760]   to do cold water immersion than anything else,
[00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:09.160]   cold showers after that,
[00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:11.680]   and put yourself into a cold environment
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:13.380]   would be the third best thing.
[00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:15.000]   I'm not going to get into cryo chambers
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.240]   because they carry quite a high degree of cost.
[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:20.620]   And again, there aren't many studies of them.
[00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:23.060]   So if you have access to cryo chambers,
[00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:24.740]   I'm sure that the cryo chamber facility
[00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:26.340]   has told you about all these incredible benefits,
[00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:29.040]   and I don't doubt that some of those benefits truly exist,
[00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:31.340]   but most people just don't have the resources
[00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:32.380]   or the access to those.
[00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:33.640]   So we're going to leave cryo chambers
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:34.940]   out of today's discussion.
[00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:37.100]   And of course, I realize there's a fourth category
[00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:38.400]   of cold exposure out there.
[00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:39.860]   People who are wearing ice vests,
[00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:40.880]   believe it or not, those exist.
[00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:43.400]   Ice underwear, yes, those exist.
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:46.760]   You can look for them on Amazon if you like.
[00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:49.340]   They are putting cold packs in their armpits
[00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:52.620]   or in their groin or elsewhere in order to stimulate
[00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:54.460]   some of the effects of cold
[00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:56.780]   on mental and physical performance.
[00:37:56.780 --> 00:37:59.940]   I'm not going to address those in too much detail today.
[00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:02.420]   They can be efficient in certain ways,
[00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:04.900]   but as you'll learn about later in the episode,
[00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:07.460]   cooling the palms, the upper face,
[00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:08.620]   and the bottoms of the feet
[00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:10.400]   is going to be far more efficient.
[00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:12.860]   And unfortunately, I think most of the people
[00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:15.340]   that are using ice packs to increase their core metabolism
[00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:18.420]   are not aware of the glabber skin cooling
[00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:20.820]   and how it can be a very, very potent stimulus.
[00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:23.100]   We'll return to that later.
[00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:25.820]   Unless I say otherwise, I'm mainly going to be focusing
[00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:28.000]   on cold water immersion and cold showers.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:29.460]   So let's talk about protocols
[00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:31.700]   for enhancing mental health and performance
[00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:33.540]   using deliberate cold exposure.
[00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:37.460]   What happens when we get into cold
[00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:41.460]   is that we experience an increase in norepinephrine,
[00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:44.500]   in noradrenaline release and in adrenaline release.
[00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:47.180]   The fact that cold exposure, deliberate or no,
[00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:50.140]   increases norepinephrine and epinephrine
[00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:51.740]   in our brain and body
[00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:54.400]   means that it is a very reliable stimulus
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:56.540]   for increasing norepinephrine and epinephrine.
[00:38:56.540 --> 00:38:58.400]   That's sort of an obvious statement,
[00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:02.020]   but that obvious statement can be leveraged
[00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:05.540]   to systematically build up what we call resilience.
[00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:08.660]   Now, when we experience a stressor in life,
[00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:10.800]   whether or not it's something bad happens
[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:14.100]   in our relationship or something bad happens in the world
[00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:16.340]   and we feel stress,
[00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:18.460]   that stress is the consequence of increases
[00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:21.980]   in norepinephrine and epinephrine in our brain and body.
[00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:23.660]   Very similar, if not identical,
[00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:24.720]   to the kinds of increases
[00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:27.180]   that come from deliberate cold exposure.
[00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:29.940]   So deliberate cold exposure is an opportunity
[00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:32.940]   to deliberately stress our body.
[00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:34.520]   And yet, because it's deliberate
[00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:36.000]   and because we can take certain steps,
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.340]   which I'll describe in a moment,
[00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:41.840]   we can learn to maintain mental clarity.
[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:44.300]   We can learn to maintain calm
[00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:47.500]   while our body is in a state of stress.
[00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:49.800]   And that can be immensely useful
[00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:53.300]   when encountering stressors in other parts of life.
[00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:55.540]   And that's what we call resilience or grit,
[00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:57.460]   our ability or mental toughness,
[00:39:57.460 --> 00:40:01.580]   our ability to lean into challenge or to tolerate challenge
[00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:04.140]   while keeping our heads straight, so to speak.
[00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:07.700]   So one simple protocol for increasing resilience
[00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:10.400]   is to pick a temperature that's uncomfortable,
[00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:12.540]   of shower or cold immersion,
[00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:15.820]   and then to get in for a certain duration of time
[00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:17.200]   and then to get out.
[00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:18.240]   Now, it's important to understand
[00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:20.160]   that people will experience different levels
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:22.320]   of norepinephrine and adrenaline release
[00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:24.140]   when getting into cold water.
[00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:27.980]   Some people, because they dread the cold so much,
[00:40:27.980 --> 00:40:29.880]   will actually experience norepinephrine
[00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:32.360]   and epinephrine increases even before they get
[00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:35.100]   into the cold water or under the cold shower.
[00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:36.240]   Now, you may have experienced this.
[00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:37.900]   I've certainly experienced this.
[00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:39.540]   I'm dreading it, I don't want to do it,
[00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:41.820]   and I have to force myself to do it.
[00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:45.580]   And indeed, epinephrine and norepinephrine and its surges
[00:40:45.580 --> 00:40:47.840]   can be thought of as sort of walls
[00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:49.920]   that we have to confront and go over.
[00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:52.020]   And I'd like you to conceptualize them that way
[00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:54.580]   because it allows us to build protocols
[00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:58.080]   that can be very objective and can allow us
[00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:01.240]   to monitor our progress in terms of building resilience.
[00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:04.140]   So one option is to simply say, okay,
[00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:06.500]   I'm going to force myself to get into the cold shower
[00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:07.700]   for one minute.
[00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:08.540]   How cold?
[00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:10.440]   Again, uncomfortably cold, but you can stay in safely.
[00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:13.680]   Or I'm going to get into the ice bath for one minute.
[00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:16.820]   Ice baths are very cold inevitably.
[00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:20.020]   And what is also inevitable is that when you get
[00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:22.360]   into the cold, you will experience a surge
[00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:24.080]   in epinephrine and norepinephrine.
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:26.680]   That's non-negotiable because it's mediated
[00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:30.060]   by cold receptors on the surface of your body and your skin
[00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:32.880]   and the way that they trigger the release of norepinephrine
[00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:35.260]   and epinephrine, not just from the adrenals,
[00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:37.220]   from the adrenal glands above your kidneys,
[00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:38.780]   but also from regions of your brain,
[00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:39.940]   like the locus coeruleus,
[00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:42.900]   which cause increases in attention and alertness,
[00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:45.280]   and from other locations in your body
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:47.120]   where epinephrine and norepinephrine are released.
[00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:51.740]   In other words, cold is a non-negotiable stimulus
[00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:55.080]   for increasing epinephrine and norepinephrine.
[00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:57.980]   Even if you are the toughest person in the world
[00:41:57.980 --> 00:42:01.780]   and you love the cold, that increase in epinephrine
[00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:04.020]   and norepinephrine is going to happen.
[00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:06.700]   So the way to think about norepinephrine and epinephrine
[00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:09.220]   in this context of building mental resilience
[00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:11.440]   is that you have two options.
[00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:15.320]   You can either try to extend the duration of time
[00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:17.440]   that you are in the deliberate cold exposure.
[00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:20.980]   So going from one minute to 75 seconds to two minutes
[00:42:20.980 --> 00:42:23.380]   and so on over a period of days,
[00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:26.120]   or one way to approach this
[00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:27.840]   and the way that I particularly favor
[00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:31.520]   is to take the context of the day and the moment
[00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:35.000]   into account, meaning we have different levels of grit
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.160]   and resilience on different days
[00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:39.740]   and depending on the landscape of our life at the time,
[00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:42.100]   even the time of day that we're doing these protocols
[00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:44.500]   and start to be able to sense
[00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:47.380]   the release of epinephrine, excuse me,
[00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:49.620]   and norepinephrine in our brain and body
[00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:52.480]   and see those as walls that we want to climb over
[00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:53.860]   in order to build resilience
[00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:57.900]   and to start counting the number of walls that we traverse
[00:42:57.900 --> 00:42:59.740]   and the distance between those walls
[00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:01.680]   as we do deliberate cold exposure.
[00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:05.260]   Let me give you an example of the timed protocol
[00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:06.840]   because that one is very straightforward,
[00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:09.560]   although I do not think it is as powerful
[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:11.000]   for building mental resilience.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:12.880]   The time protocol would be Monday,
[00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:15.320]   I do one minute of deliberate cold exposure
[00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:16.160]   at a given temperature.
[00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:18.400]   Wednesday, I extend that by 50%.
[00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:21.680]   And Friday, I do deliberate cold exposure
[00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:23.800]   for twice as long as I did on Monday.
[00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:26.200]   And if I were to continue that every week,
[00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:27.060]   Monday, Wednesday, Friday,
[00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:29.480]   I would continue to either increase the duration
[00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:34.120]   or I would lower the temperature and reduce the duration.
[00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:36.480]   This kind of thing, very much like sets and reps in the gym.
[00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:38.660]   Now that option is very objective, right?
[00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:40.280]   You could even log it in a book.
[00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:44.960]   And as you develop the ability to stay in cold temperatures,
[00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:48.160]   even progressively colder and colder temperatures
[00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:50.200]   for longer and longer periods of time,
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:52.440]   you will become more resilient.
[00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:53.600]   What do I mean by that?
[00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:55.600]   Well, my operational definition of resilience
[00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:59.120]   is that you are able to resist escape from the stressor,
[00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:02.880]   the cold, by virtue of your willpower,
[00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:05.760]   which is really your prefrontal cortex
[00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:08.800]   causing top-down control on your reflexes
[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:10.800]   and your limbic system and your hypothalamus,
[00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:11.820]   which are basically telling you
[00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:13.920]   to get out of that cold water,
[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:16.020]   get out of that cold environment.
[00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:19.000]   And in doing so, you are basically getting better
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.840]   at controlling your behavior when your brain and body
[00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:24.000]   are flooded with norepinephrine and epinephrine.
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.600]   That's a very reductionist way to explain resilience
[00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:28.080]   or grit or mental toughness,
[00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:30.500]   but it's a reductionist way of explaining it
[00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:32.320]   that is very closely tied to the biology
[00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:33.640]   and to the psychology.
[00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:37.680]   And it is a fact that norepinephrine and epinephrine
[00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:39.160]   release in the brain and body
[00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:43.500]   are the generic universal code for stressor.
[00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:45.480]   There is no unique chemical signature
[00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:46.840]   for different forms of stressors.
[00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:48.380]   That is the only one.
[00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:49.220]   Although, of course,
[00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:50.800]   there are other chemicals involved as well.
[00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:52.200]   So you could go for time
[00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:53.720]   and you could try and reduce the temperature
[00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:57.440]   and increase the time over a period of days or weeks.
[00:44:57.440 --> 00:45:00.000]   Now that's an attractive way to approach things,
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.180]   but the problem is that you don't have
[00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:06.000]   an infinite amount of room with which to lower temperature
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.100]   because eventually you will get into temperatures
[00:45:08.100 --> 00:45:10.860]   that are either so-called that they are dangerous,
[00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:13.340]   or you have to stay in cold temperatures
[00:45:13.340 --> 00:45:16.940]   for such long periods that it becomes impractical
[00:45:16.940 --> 00:45:19.300]   because presumably you also have to take care
[00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:20.440]   of other aspects of your life.
[00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:23.020]   You can't just sit all day in the ice bath.
[00:45:23.020 --> 00:45:24.220]   Now, for that reason,
[00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:27.600]   I favor a protocol in which you build mental resilience
[00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:28.760]   and mental toughness
[00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:31.060]   through two different types of protocols.
[00:45:31.060 --> 00:45:33.380]   The first one involves counting walls.
[00:45:33.380 --> 00:45:34.400]   Now, what do I mean by walls?
[00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:38.640]   I mean the sensation of, no, I don't want to do this,
[00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:42.520]   and the idea or the sensation in your brain and body
[00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:44.320]   that you actually want to leave that environment
[00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:45.520]   and go warm up.
[00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:46.680]   Now, again, for some people,
[00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:48.280]   that will be even before getting
[00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:50.080]   into the ice bath or cold shower.
[00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:52.700]   So if you are feeling very resistant
[00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:54.800]   to getting into the ice bath or cold shower
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:56.320]   and you manage to do that,
[00:45:56.320 --> 00:46:00.180]   that's going over what I would call one wall, okay?
[00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:01.640]   Then for some period of time,
[00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:05.560]   you might actually feel comfortable in the ice bath,
[00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:07.760]   cold water, or cold shower,
[00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:09.540]   and you feel like you could stay there
[00:46:09.540 --> 00:46:10.420]   for some period of time,
[00:46:10.420 --> 00:46:12.220]   that you could stay there for a minute or two minutes,
[00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:15.860]   but inevitably the next wall will arrive.
[00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:17.620]   And I would encourage you to pay attention
[00:46:17.620 --> 00:46:19.300]   to when that next wall arrives
[00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:20.960]   and actually having an awareness,
[00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:24.340]   that so-called interoceptive awareness, as we call it,
[00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:27.640]   of when that next surge in adrenaline epinephrine comes
[00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:30.360]   or whether or not it reaches a certain threshold
[00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:32.360]   in your brain and body that you feel you want to get out,
[00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:36.240]   and you're able to stay in for even just 10 seconds longer,
[00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:39.240]   that means you've traversed yet another wall.
[00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:42.140]   And if you continue to stay in that cold environment,
[00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:44.120]   you will find that the next wall will come
[00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:45.040]   and the next wall will come.
[00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:48.260]   Now, eventually, of course, you will get very, very numb,
[00:46:48.260 --> 00:46:49.360]   depending on how cold it is,
[00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:51.180]   and you could also place yourself into danger.
[00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:54.000]   So you have to maintain cognitive control,
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.260]   counting these walls, traversing these walls,
[00:46:56.260 --> 00:46:59.120]   but getting out at some point, of course.
[00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:03.880]   So my favorite protocol for building mental toughness,
[00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:07.440]   AKA grit, AKA resilience, is to take into account
[00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:10.120]   that some days just getting into the ice bath
[00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:12.640]   or cold shower represents a wall, some days it doesn't.
[00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:13.480]   Some days you get in
[00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:15.700]   and you feel like you could go 10 minutes.
[00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:16.540]   Other days you get in
[00:47:16.540 --> 00:47:18.640]   and you feel like you could only go a minute.
[00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:20.880]   And setting a designated number of walls
[00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:22.980]   before you start the protocol
[00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:24.640]   is going to be very beneficial here.
[00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:27.060]   So you say, as long as I can do it safely,
[00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:29.360]   I'm going to do three walls today.
[00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:30.480]   The first wall is getting in,
[00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:32.760]   the second wall will arrive when it arrives,
[00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:35.380]   and the third wall will arrive when it arrives,
[00:47:35.380 --> 00:47:37.100]   and I'll get over that wall and then I'll get out.
[00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:38.700]   The next day, you might do five walls.
[00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:41.920]   The next day, you might do three walls again,
[00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:43.480]   but you might lower the temperature.
[00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:45.880]   This gives you tremendous flexibility,
[00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:48.800]   and indeed, it gives you much more latitude
[00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:52.480]   to be able to use the same temperatures in different ways
[00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:54.720]   or to reduce the temperature only a little bit
[00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:56.760]   and still get a lot of stimulus,
[00:47:56.760 --> 00:48:00.140]   meaning a lot of results out of a given protocol.
[00:48:00.140 --> 00:48:02.880]   Whereas people who are just going for temperature and time
[00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:04.920]   eventually become cold adapted.
[00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:07.760]   They get very, very good at doing three minutes
[00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:10.720]   or six minutes or even 10 minutes at a given temperature.
[00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:12.880]   And so then they feel like they have to lower the temperature
[00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:14.480]   even more and even more,
[00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:16.240]   and eventually they just bottom out.
[00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:17.280]   There's nowhere else to go.
[00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:21.100]   There's nowhere to get improvements out of the protocol,
[00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:24.240]   at least not in terms of mental resilience.
[00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:26.560]   Of course, there's still the positive effects
[00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:28.520]   on inflammation and metabolism, et cetera,
[00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:30.800]   that we'll talk about in a little bit.
[00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:33.520]   But the key thing here is to design protocols
[00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:35.600]   that are going to work for you over time.
[00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:38.480]   And for you very, very hardy, very, very tough guys
[00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:41.520]   and gals out there that can get right into an ice bath
[00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:43.080]   or a very, very cold immersion,
[00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:45.480]   and you can just grind it out for six or 10 minutes,
[00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:48.680]   or you can even do that by remaining peaceful.
[00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:51.080]   Well, more points to you, but guess what?
[00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:53.240]   That's the equivalent of already having loaded up
[00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:56.320]   the barbell with 600 pounds and done your 10 reps.
[00:48:56.320 --> 00:48:58.960]   There's not a whole lot more variable space
[00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:02.300]   with which to get benefits from that stimulus.
[00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:03.400]   And in the weight room,
[00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:05.280]   people understand that you can adjust, for instance,
[00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:06.460]   the speed of the movement,
[00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:07.960]   or you can start combining that movement
[00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:09.620]   with pre-exhaustion, et cetera.
[00:49:09.620 --> 00:49:11.060]   With cold exposure,
[00:49:11.060 --> 00:49:13.580]   you don't have as much variable space to play with.
[00:49:13.580 --> 00:49:15.660]   So if your goal is to build resilience,
[00:49:15.660 --> 00:49:18.500]   either go for time as a function of temperature,
[00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:23.220]   or what I suggest is to start recognizing these walls
[00:49:23.220 --> 00:49:25.880]   as an experience of resistance in you
[00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:27.340]   and going over those walls,
[00:49:27.340 --> 00:49:28.820]   set a certain number of walls
[00:49:28.820 --> 00:49:31.260]   that you're going to go over on a given day
[00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:34.640]   and do that at a given temperature, and then to mix it up.
[00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:38.420]   And ideally, you might even throw in one more wall
[00:49:38.420 --> 00:49:41.080]   at the end if you're really feeling bold and brave,
[00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:43.420]   because that's going to build out further resilience.
[00:49:43.420 --> 00:49:45.460]   But if you want cold exposure to work for you
[00:49:45.460 --> 00:49:46.900]   for sake of building up resilience
[00:49:46.900 --> 00:49:48.460]   and mental toughness over time,
[00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:51.340]   you're going to want to vary this parameter space
[00:49:51.340 --> 00:49:52.740]   in some sort of way,
[00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:56.060]   and you don't have to be super systematic about it.
[00:49:56.060 --> 00:49:58.300]   That's the beauty of this kind of approach,
[00:49:58.300 --> 00:49:59.900]   because you're relying on the fact
[00:49:59.900 --> 00:50:02.860]   that those walls really represent times
[00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:05.360]   in which you are forcing your top-down control,
[00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:08.140]   your prefrontal cortex, to clamp down on your reflex,
[00:50:08.140 --> 00:50:10.200]   and you're learning behavioral control
[00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:12.940]   in the context of your body having elevated levels
[00:50:12.940 --> 00:50:15.500]   of these catecholamines, norepinephrine and epinephrine.
[00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:17.460]   And that translates to real life
[00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:19.860]   in a much more realistic way, I believe,
[00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:23.280]   because in real life, you're not really engaging
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:26.220]   in stressors for a given amount of time
[00:50:26.220 --> 00:50:28.000]   that you know how long it's going to last,
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:29.420]   and you know the context, no.
[00:50:29.420 --> 00:50:32.400]   Most stressors arrive in the form of surprises we don't like,
[00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:34.800]   text messages that deliver bad news,
[00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:37.500]   information about the outside world or real world
[00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:39.960]   and online interactions that send our system
[00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:42.820]   into a state of increasing norepinephrine and epinephrine.
[00:50:42.820 --> 00:50:44.620]   And if you start to think of those as walls
[00:50:44.620 --> 00:50:46.060]   that you can tolerate and climb over
[00:50:46.060 --> 00:50:48.460]   while staying calm and clear of mind,
[00:50:48.460 --> 00:50:52.140]   then you can really imagine how the ice bath
[00:50:52.140 --> 00:50:54.980]   and other forms of cold exposure are really serving
[00:50:54.980 --> 00:50:57.760]   to train you up for real life stressors.
[00:50:57.760 --> 00:50:59.620]   Okay, the next question that I always get
[00:50:59.620 --> 00:51:02.180]   is what should my mental state be
[00:51:02.180 --> 00:51:04.900]   while I'm exposing myself to this uncomfortable
[00:51:04.900 --> 00:51:07.620]   yet safe condition of cold?
[00:51:07.620 --> 00:51:09.560]   Well, you have two options,
[00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:11.580]   and there are probably other options as well.
[00:51:11.580 --> 00:51:13.980]   One is to try and calm yourself
[00:51:13.980 --> 00:51:17.640]   to remain as mentally still as possible.
[00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:21.100]   The other is to lean into that challenge
[00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:22.620]   and so to grind it out.
[00:51:22.620 --> 00:51:25.060]   And here, I have to say that this is a lot like
[00:51:25.060 --> 00:51:27.380]   teaching someone to drive on a gravel road.
[00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:29.860]   For any of you that have driven on a gravel road,
[00:51:29.860 --> 00:51:32.820]   you know that there is no optimal speed
[00:51:32.820 --> 00:51:33.960]   for all gravel roads.
[00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:36.100]   It depends on the density of the gravel, et cetera,
[00:51:36.100 --> 00:51:37.720]   and the vehicle, et cetera.
[00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:40.100]   So for instance, on some gravel roads,
[00:51:40.100 --> 00:51:42.940]   when you start to drive and the dust starts to kick up,
[00:51:42.940 --> 00:51:44.660]   your best option is to drive fast
[00:51:44.660 --> 00:51:46.700]   and put that dust cloud behind you.
[00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:49.080]   On other gravel roads, if you try and do that,
[00:51:49.080 --> 00:51:50.740]   the dust actually kicks up around the vehicle
[00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:51.980]   and it makes it hard to see.
[00:51:51.980 --> 00:51:53.920]   Sometimes you have to slow down.
[00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:55.520]   The same thing is true for getting
[00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:57.480]   through deliberate cold exposure.
[00:51:57.480 --> 00:51:59.500]   Sometimes it's easier to calm yourself.
[00:51:59.500 --> 00:52:01.700]   One way to do that is through double inhales
[00:52:01.700 --> 00:52:03.960]   through the nose and extended exhales through the mouth,
[00:52:03.960 --> 00:52:06.740]   or simply by trying to control your breathing
[00:52:06.740 --> 00:52:08.700]   and reduce the pace of your breathing
[00:52:08.700 --> 00:52:11.200]   and increase the volume of your breathing.
[00:52:12.340 --> 00:52:15.380]   I have to say that everyone experiences a shortening
[00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:18.300]   of breath when they get into uncomfortably cold water.
[00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:21.580]   That is a universal physiological response.
[00:52:21.580 --> 00:52:26.180]   Everyone also experiences a 30 to 80% decrease
[00:52:26.180 --> 00:52:29.400]   in cognitive function, in particular of the frontal cortex.
[00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:31.400]   The metabolism of your frontal cortex goes down.
[00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:34.400]   The metabolism, meaning the activity of brain areas
[00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:36.940]   associated with stress and panic goes way up.
[00:52:36.940 --> 00:52:41.380]   And so anchoring your mind in cognitive activities
[00:52:41.380 --> 00:52:44.180]   as you get into the cold can be very, very helpful
[00:52:44.180 --> 00:52:46.820]   for maintaining clarity of mind.
[00:52:46.820 --> 00:52:48.780]   In fact, one thing that I sometimes recommend
[00:52:48.780 --> 00:52:50.660]   is that people try and engage
[00:52:50.660 --> 00:52:53.680]   in some sort of cognitive exercise while in the cold,
[00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:55.580]   not as a form of distraction,
[00:52:55.580 --> 00:52:57.580]   but as a way to maintain clarity of thinking
[00:52:57.580 --> 00:52:59.840]   and to learn how to do that when the body is flooded
[00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:02.240]   with all these chemicals that make us stressed.
[00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:04.200]   So for instance, you could do math problems
[00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:06.020]   and not two plus two equals four,
[00:53:06.020 --> 00:53:08.220]   not three times three equals nine,
[00:53:08.220 --> 00:53:10.700]   but things that require a little bit more focus
[00:53:10.700 --> 00:53:13.340]   and attention, working memory and so forth.
[00:53:13.340 --> 00:53:16.440]   You could also start to have thoughts
[00:53:16.440 --> 00:53:20.540]   that you deliberately impose a full sentence structure on.
[00:53:20.540 --> 00:53:22.100]   That's actually quite tough.
[00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:25.280]   You could try and recall specific bouts of information
[00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:26.120]   that are challenging.
[00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:29.240]   This is teaching your mind how to stay online,
[00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:30.080]   or rather I should say,
[00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:32.460]   this is you teaching your prefrontal cortex
[00:53:32.460 --> 00:53:33.980]   how to stay engaged
[00:53:33.980 --> 00:53:36.840]   while you have high levels of stress in your body.
[00:53:36.840 --> 00:53:40.760]   Years ago, I had a friend who works in the neuroscience
[00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:42.440]   world, research neuroscientist,
[00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:45.680]   who was obsessed with this very bizarre sport
[00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:47.660]   that I don't necessarily recommend at all,
[00:53:47.660 --> 00:53:50.600]   which is the combination of boxing and chess.
[00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:51.800]   You may have seen this on YouTube
[00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:54.580]   where people will box around, legitimate boxing around,
[00:53:54.580 --> 00:53:56.520]   they're sparring all out often.
[00:53:56.520 --> 00:53:58.200]   And then at the end of the round,
[00:53:58.200 --> 00:53:59.280]   instead of resting in the corner,
[00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:01.000]   they actually sit down and play chess.
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:03.060]   And then they go back to boxing and back to chess.
[00:54:03.060 --> 00:54:05.540]   Again, not a support that I recommend,
[00:54:05.540 --> 00:54:07.120]   but the reason he was obsessed with this
[00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:10.280]   is because he studies the impact of stress
[00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:11.360]   on cognitive performance.
[00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:14.320]   And what that particular very bizarre sport was doing
[00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:15.600]   was toggling back and forth
[00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:17.580]   between different states of mind.
[00:54:17.580 --> 00:54:22.040]   Now it's used both to increase cognitive clarity
[00:54:22.040 --> 00:54:23.600]   for the fighter when they box,
[00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:25.420]   because staying calm and clear thinking
[00:54:25.420 --> 00:54:27.840]   is very important to winning boxing matches.
[00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:29.760]   Believe it or not, it's not an all outrage.
[00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:32.180]   It's a very calculated game of mental chess
[00:54:32.180 --> 00:54:33.020]   and physical chess.
[00:54:33.020 --> 00:54:35.440]   It's quite high stakes, as you can imagine.
[00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:40.700]   It's also used in some circles as a way to teach people
[00:54:40.700 --> 00:54:42.640]   how to engage in cognitive performance
[00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:44.360]   when their body is simply filled with stress.
[00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:46.820]   So in the boxing chess example,
[00:54:46.820 --> 00:54:49.040]   the replacement for the cold water
[00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:50.320]   is actually the boxing, right?
[00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:52.280]   It's the thing that's supposed to induce the stress
[00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:53.700]   'cause getting hit is stressful
[00:54:53.700 --> 00:54:56.960]   and the risk of getting hit is stressful for most people.
[00:54:56.960 --> 00:55:00.700]   So again, if you think about deliberate cold exposure
[00:55:00.700 --> 00:55:03.360]   as a way of just systematically and reliably
[00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:05.420]   inducing epinephrine and norepinephrine release
[00:55:05.420 --> 00:55:07.000]   and delivering stress,
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:09.720]   well, then this idea of maintaining cognitive clarity
[00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:11.600]   and actually engaging in cognitive tasks
[00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:14.240]   while in the ice bath or cold shower
[00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:15.600]   can actually be very beneficial,
[00:55:15.600 --> 00:55:16.940]   even though it might sound a little bit silly.
[00:55:16.940 --> 00:55:18.640]   You're really training up your ability
[00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:20.400]   to keep your brain working
[00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:24.160]   when the reflex is to shut down the parts of your brain
[00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:26.300]   that are involved in deliberate planning and thinking.
[00:55:26.300 --> 00:55:29.280]   Now, another important aspect of deliberate cold exposure
[00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:32.240]   that I rarely, if ever hear discussed,
[00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:34.480]   but is vitally important
[00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:37.640]   is whether or not you move around or not.
[00:55:37.640 --> 00:55:38.860]   And here's the reason.
[00:55:38.860 --> 00:55:40.580]   When you get into cold water
[00:55:40.580 --> 00:55:44.260]   and you remain there for some period of time,
[00:55:44.260 --> 00:55:46.500]   your body is generating heat
[00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:49.340]   and that heat generates what's called a thermal layer
[00:55:49.340 --> 00:55:51.240]   that surrounds your entire body.
[00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:54.360]   So if you stay still,
[00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:57.220]   you are actually warmer than if you move around.
[00:55:57.220 --> 00:55:58.420]   You can try this the next time
[00:55:58.420 --> 00:55:59.920]   you're doing your deliberate cold exposure.
[00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:01.160]   If you're submerged up to the neck,
[00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:03.660]   sit there for about 10, 30 seconds
[00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:05.480]   and be very, very still of body.
[00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:07.360]   In fact, this is the way that most people
[00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:09.080]   start to do deliberate cold exposure.
[00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:10.420]   They give this very stoic look.
[00:56:10.420 --> 00:56:11.260]   They don't blink.
[00:56:11.260 --> 00:56:12.080]   They look very peaceful.
[00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:13.780]   Some of them even look tough,
[00:56:13.780 --> 00:56:17.760]   or they make a very even, A, emotional face,
[00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:20.140]   and so it looks like they're really tough,
[00:56:20.140 --> 00:56:22.380]   but they are so still that, believe it or not,
[00:56:22.380 --> 00:56:26.520]   they're not providing the most potent stimulus.
[00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:30.660]   If they or you were to move around in that water,
[00:56:30.660 --> 00:56:32.680]   what would happen is you'd break up the thermal layer
[00:56:32.680 --> 00:56:35.960]   and that you actually experienced that as much colder.
[00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:39.100]   So if you really want to push the resilience aspect,
[00:56:39.100 --> 00:56:42.020]   or for instance, if you want to use a given temperature
[00:56:42.020 --> 00:56:43.240]   that you're comfortable in,
[00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:45.500]   but that you want to increase the stimulus
[00:56:45.500 --> 00:56:47.360]   and you want to get some more benefit
[00:56:47.360 --> 00:56:49.160]   for mental resilience training,
[00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:51.560]   well, then get into the cold water,
[00:56:51.560 --> 00:56:53.800]   move your body around continuously,
[00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:55.340]   but try and keep your mind still
[00:56:55.340 --> 00:56:57.540]   or even do some sort of cognitive task.
[00:56:57.540 --> 00:56:59.160]   So as you're starting to realize,
[00:56:59.160 --> 00:57:00.320]   there are a bunch of different variables
[00:57:00.320 --> 00:57:01.240]   that you can play with
[00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:03.720]   while maintaining the same temperature of water,
[00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:06.920]   and in doing so, really keep you in the zone
[00:57:06.920 --> 00:57:10.820]   of what should and absolutely has to be safe for you
[00:57:10.820 --> 00:57:13.120]   without having to just continually drop the temperature
[00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:15.720]   from, say, 60 degrees to 55 to 40 to 33,
[00:57:15.720 --> 00:57:16.640]   because as I mentioned before,
[00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:18.240]   eventually you're going to bottom out.
[00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:20.720]   So if you're one of those people that likes to look tough
[00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:22.880]   or really relaxed while you're in the ice bath
[00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:24.080]   or cold water immersion,
[00:57:24.080 --> 00:57:26.760]   just realize that you're actually cheating yourself
[00:57:26.760 --> 00:57:28.320]   out of part of the stimulus.
[00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:29.840]   Keep those limbs moving,
[00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:33.600]   and of course, limbs under the water, feet and hands,
[00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:35.740]   is going to be a more potent stimulus
[00:57:35.740 --> 00:57:37.640]   than hands and feet out
[00:57:37.640 --> 00:57:39.180]   for reasons that should be obvious
[00:57:39.180 --> 00:57:40.180]   based on what we talked about
[00:57:40.180 --> 00:57:42.340]   in terms of glab or skin cooling.
[00:57:42.340 --> 00:57:45.420]   So keep those submerged, move your body, pedal,
[00:57:45.420 --> 00:57:48.040]   maybe move your knees up and down, pedal your feet,
[00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:50.080]   and trust me, it's going to feel a lot colder
[00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:52.260]   than were you to remain stone still.
[00:57:52.260 --> 00:57:54.520]   Another very common question is how often
[00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:56.720]   to do deliberate cold exposure.
[00:57:56.720 --> 00:57:59.340]   It's tough to make a recommendation on that
[00:57:59.340 --> 00:58:01.740]   based on any peer-reviewed study,
[00:58:01.740 --> 00:58:03.220]   although there are a few in humans
[00:58:03.220 --> 00:58:07.520]   that point to a threshold of 11 minutes total per week,
[00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:09.400]   so that's total throughout the week,
[00:58:09.400 --> 00:58:11.600]   divided into two or four sessions
[00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:13.540]   of two or three minutes or so.
[00:58:13.540 --> 00:58:16.340]   Now, that 11-minute cutoff is not a strict threshold
[00:58:16.340 --> 00:58:20.100]   and is actually geared more towards increases in metabolism.
[00:58:20.100 --> 00:58:22.940]   We'll get into this a little bit later in the episode,
[00:58:22.940 --> 00:58:25.600]   but I think the 11-minute threshold,
[00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:28.220]   meaning 11 minutes total of deliberate cold exposure
[00:58:28.220 --> 00:58:31.420]   per week is a pretty good number to use
[00:58:31.420 --> 00:58:34.940]   if you need a number in order to keep you consistent.
[00:58:34.940 --> 00:58:36.400]   But as we talked about earlier,
[00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:39.500]   some of you are going to be in the ice bath
[00:58:39.500 --> 00:58:42.020]   or cold immersion or cold shower for one minute.
[00:58:42.020 --> 00:58:44.120]   Others of you will be in there for 10 minutes,
[00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:47.540]   depending on how frequent and how high, if you will,
[00:58:47.540 --> 00:58:50.140]   those walls of adrenaline are coming.
[00:58:50.140 --> 00:58:51.980]   So for some of you,
[00:58:51.980 --> 00:58:54.260]   getting into a cold shower for three minutes total
[00:58:54.260 --> 00:58:58.080]   for the whole week will represent a tremendous achievement
[00:58:58.080 --> 00:59:00.820]   in terms of willpower and overcoming the resistance
[00:59:00.820 --> 00:59:02.340]   to doing that, overcoming those walls.
[00:59:02.340 --> 00:59:04.980]   For others of you, three minutes is nothing.
[00:59:04.980 --> 00:59:06.880]   So what do I recommend?
[00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:11.060]   I recommend that you get at least 11 minutes total per week,
[00:59:11.060 --> 00:59:13.240]   but at the point where 11 minutes total per week
[00:59:13.240 --> 00:59:14.420]   is very easy for you,
[00:59:14.420 --> 00:59:17.180]   or is no longer representing a significant mental challenge,
[00:59:17.180 --> 00:59:19.100]   meaning you're not experiencing many of these walls,
[00:59:19.100 --> 00:59:21.740]   you're excited to get into the cold shower or immersion,
[00:59:21.740 --> 00:59:24.560]   you're going through it easily, you're cruising basically,
[00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:27.820]   then I would say either lower the temperature safely,
[00:59:27.820 --> 00:59:31.380]   of course, extend the duration safely, of course,
[00:59:31.380 --> 00:59:33.840]   or increase the frequency so that you're doing this
[00:59:33.840 --> 00:59:36.660]   perhaps every day or maybe five days a week
[00:59:36.660 --> 00:59:37.500]   or three days a week.
[00:59:37.500 --> 00:59:39.320]   I personally get tremendous benefit
[00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:42.460]   from doing deliberate cold exposure three times a week
[00:59:42.460 --> 00:59:45.560]   and using the walls method that I described earlier
[00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:47.440]   as my gauge for how long to stay in.
[00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:49.620]   And typically that means that I'm staying in
[00:59:49.620 --> 00:59:53.740]   for anywhere from two minutes to six minutes per session,
[00:59:53.740 --> 00:59:58.600]   and that averages out to about 11 to 15 minutes total
[00:59:58.600 --> 00:59:59.580]   per week.
[00:59:59.580 --> 01:00:02.860]   So again, I do not think that you need to be super strict
[01:00:02.860 --> 01:00:04.200]   about these guidelines.
[01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:06.920]   It's most important when embracing a protocol,
[01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:08.220]   A, that you do it safely,
[01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:11.340]   but secondarily that you do it consistently.
[01:00:11.340 --> 01:00:13.140]   So find what you can do consistently
[01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:15.120]   and then vary the parameters that will allow you
[01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:18.340]   to continue to do deliberate cold exposure consistently,
[01:00:18.340 --> 01:00:20.500]   regardless of whether or not you have access to a shower
[01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:22.180]   or a cold immersion, et cetera.
[01:00:22.180 --> 01:00:24.380]   Okay, so we've been talking about mental effects
[01:00:24.380 --> 01:00:26.260]   and the use of deliberate cold exposure
[01:00:26.260 --> 01:00:28.060]   for sake of building resilience,
[01:00:28.060 --> 01:00:30.620]   which I do believe can be tremendously powerful.
[01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:35.020]   Look, it's no coincidence that the screening
[01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:38.900]   and the training for Navy SEALs involves a lot of exposure
[01:00:38.900 --> 01:00:40.080]   to cold water.
[01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:41.780]   One could argue that it is deliberate
[01:00:41.780 --> 01:00:43.740]   because they elect to go to BUD/S,
[01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:46.400]   but when they get into the cold water at BUD/S
[01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:48.660]   is dictated by the instructors.
[01:00:48.660 --> 01:00:52.260]   And the reason they use cold water exposure as the stressor
[01:00:52.260 --> 01:00:55.200]   is that it does offer considerable leeway
[01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:58.000]   in terms of duration and temperature,
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.780]   in terms of how you can use it as a stressor,
[01:01:00.780 --> 01:01:03.980]   whereas things like heat don't offer much variable space,
[01:01:03.980 --> 01:01:06.640]   as we say, there isn't a lot of room
[01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:09.620]   beyond which you start injuring or even killing people
[01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:10.720]   by using heat.
[01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:12.540]   So there are a lot of forms of stressors out there,
[01:01:12.540 --> 01:01:14.540]   but cold is one that we can titrate,
[01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:16.420]   that we can adjust in ways that can allow us
[01:01:16.420 --> 01:01:21.420]   to continually build up and/or maintain mental toughness.
[01:01:21.420 --> 01:01:25.580]   Now, deliberate cold exposure also has many effects
[01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:28.760]   on chemicals other than norepinephrine and epinephrine,
[01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:32.020]   most notably the neuromodulator dopamine,
[01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:34.380]   which is involved in elevating our mood,
[01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:38.140]   making us feel energized and enhancing our ability to focus.
[01:01:38.140 --> 01:01:41.180]   And that has a lot to do with how dopamine engages us
[01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:44.560]   in motivated states, tends to narrow our thinking
[01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:46.720]   and our behavior into a particular trench
[01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:47.980]   of goal-directed behavior.
[01:01:47.980 --> 01:01:50.540]   If you want to learn more about dopamine,
[01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:52.380]   you can learn a lot about dopamine
[01:01:52.380 --> 01:01:54.140]   in our episode about dopamine.
[01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:55.300]   It's at hubermanlab.com.
[01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:56.140]   You can find it.
[01:01:56.140 --> 01:01:59.280]   It's a two and a half hour plus kind of deep dive
[01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:02.900]   into all things dopamine, focus, motivation, et cetera.
[01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:08.700]   Deliberate cold exposure has a very powerful effect
[01:02:08.700 --> 01:02:11.060]   on the release of dopamine in our brain and body.
[01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:13.000]   And this is one of the main reasons
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:16.080]   why people continue to do deliberate cold exposure.
[01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:19.160]   Basically, it makes us feel good
[01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:21.260]   and it continues to make us feel good
[01:02:21.260 --> 01:02:23.740]   even after we get out of the cold environment.
[01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:25.440]   In fact, some people would say
[01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:26.980]   they don't feel good in the cold environment.
[01:02:26.980 --> 01:02:30.140]   It's all stress for them, but afterwards they feel great.
[01:02:30.140 --> 01:02:32.260]   One of our previous guests, Dr. Anna Lempke,
[01:02:32.260 --> 01:02:33.420]   who's a medical doctor
[01:02:33.420 --> 01:02:34.940]   at Stanford University School of Medicine,
[01:02:34.940 --> 01:02:37.260]   she's a close colleague of mine,
[01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:40.400]   described the use of dopamine in her book, "Dopamine Nation,"
[01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:42.300]   an incredible book about addiction and dopamine,
[01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:43.420]   I should mention,
[01:02:43.420 --> 01:02:48.420]   and the use of dopamine elicited by cold water exposure
[01:02:48.420 --> 01:02:50.580]   by one of her patients.
[01:02:50.580 --> 01:02:53.800]   What I'm referring to is the fact that one of her patients
[01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:57.100]   helped themselves get and stay sober off drugs
[01:02:57.100 --> 01:03:01.000]   by using deliberate cold exposure to increase dopamine.
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.100]   So a healthier form of dopamine release
[01:03:03.100 --> 01:03:07.020]   than they were engaged in prior to getting sober.
[01:03:07.020 --> 01:03:10.580]   Now, the basis for dopamine release in response
[01:03:10.580 --> 01:03:12.700]   to cold exposure is that the catecholamines,
[01:03:12.700 --> 01:03:15.140]   norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine
[01:03:15.140 --> 01:03:18.660]   tend to be co-released by the same sorts of stimuli,
[01:03:18.660 --> 01:03:21.380]   but most stressors and in particular things
[01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:24.800]   that evoke stress or our feelings of stress internally
[01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:27.980]   that we don't like do not increase dopamine.
[01:03:27.980 --> 01:03:30.520]   They only increase norepinephrine and epinephrine,
[01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:32.180]   but deliberate cold exposure
[01:03:32.180 --> 01:03:36.020]   seems to cause a dramatic increase in dopamine,
[01:03:36.020 --> 01:03:37.820]   and this has actually been substantiated
[01:03:37.820 --> 01:03:39.620]   in a really beautiful study
[01:03:39.620 --> 01:03:42.520]   entitled "Human Physiological Responses to Immersion
[01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:44.620]   into Water of Different Temperatures."
[01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:46.940]   The first author is Sramek,
[01:03:46.940 --> 01:03:49.740]   I'm almost certainly pronouncing that poorly,
[01:03:49.740 --> 01:03:54.180]   if not incorrectly, S-R-A-M-E-K.
[01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:55.780]   This was published in the European Journal
[01:03:55.780 --> 01:03:58.400]   of Applied Physiology in the year 2000.
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:00.660]   Really a beautiful study, I love this study.
[01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:04.500]   They took people and they had them sit in chairs underwater,
[01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:06.140]   but their head was out and they were,
[01:04:06.140 --> 01:04:08.020]   so they were immersed up to the neck
[01:04:08.020 --> 01:04:10.020]   in either three different,
[01:04:10.020 --> 01:04:12.100]   either of three different temperatures, excuse me,
[01:04:12.100 --> 01:04:16.220]   32 degrees Celsius, which is 89 degrees Fahrenheit,
[01:04:16.220 --> 01:04:19.300]   20 degrees Celsius, which is 68 degrees Fahrenheit,
[01:04:19.300 --> 01:04:23.720]   or 14 degrees Celsius, which is 57.2 degrees Fahrenheit.
[01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:27.380]   So not super cold, but then what they did
[01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:29.980]   is they measured people's core body temperature throughout,
[01:04:29.980 --> 01:04:31.520]   they measured their metabolism,
[01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:35.020]   and they looked at serum levels of things like
[01:04:35.020 --> 01:04:37.540]   norepinephrine, epinephrine, dopamine, and cortisol,
[01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:39.360]   serum meaning within the blood.
[01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:42.240]   So a really nice and quite thorough study.
[01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:46.240]   There were not a huge number of subjects in the study,
[01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:48.460]   but nonetheless, it was a very thorough study
[01:04:48.460 --> 01:04:52.580]   in terms of the number of variables that they explored.
[01:04:52.580 --> 01:04:55.580]   So I just want to briefly highlight some of what they saw
[01:04:55.580 --> 01:04:57.700]   or what they observed in this study.
[01:04:57.700 --> 01:05:01.640]   First of all, all the groups were in the water
[01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:04.480]   of a given temperature for one hour,
[01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:06.760]   which is much longer than most of the deliberate
[01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:09.460]   cold exposure protocols that anyone is using at home.
[01:05:09.460 --> 01:05:12.200]   I mean, maybe you're taking one hour long cold showers,
[01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:14.440]   maybe you're getting into the ice bath for an hour,
[01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:15.500]   although I don't recommend that,
[01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:18.360]   I think you'd probably get badly hypothermic,
[01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:21.420]   or maybe you're getting into a cold water immersion
[01:05:21.420 --> 01:05:22.480]   for some period of time,
[01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:24.980]   but I have a hard time imagining that it would be an hour,
[01:05:24.980 --> 01:05:27.100]   and I don't suggest that if it's very cold.
[01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:28.880]   So this study focused on actually
[01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:31.800]   somewhat moderately cool temperatures,
[01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:33.960]   not what I think most people would consider
[01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:35.640]   very, very cold temperatures,
[01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:38.380]   but extended the duration for quite a while.
[01:05:38.380 --> 01:05:42.120]   So again, 32 degrees Celsius, 20 degrees Celsius,
[01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:45.700]   or 14 degrees Celsius, here's what they observed.
[01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:48.720]   The group that was immersed up to the neck
[01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:51.920]   in 32 degrees Celsius, that is 89 degrees Fahrenheit,
[01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:55.380]   water did not experience a shift in metabolism,
[01:05:55.380 --> 01:05:58.960]   nor a significant increase in dopamine, norepinephrine,
[01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:01.020]   or these other catecholamines.
[01:06:01.020 --> 01:06:03.640]   The group that was in 20 degrees Celsius,
[01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:08.120]   meaning 68 degree Fahrenheit water for an hour,
[01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:12.040]   experienced a 93% increase in metabolic rate,
[01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:15.920]   which is remarkable given that the water wasn't that cold,
[01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:18.520]   and yet an hour is a pretty long time to be in there.
[01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:21.280]   And again, it speaks to the dramatic effect
[01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:23.680]   of heat transfer that water has,
[01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:25.580]   which I mentioned earlier as opposed to being out
[01:06:25.580 --> 01:06:27.340]   in the air at 68 degrees,
[01:06:27.340 --> 01:06:29.580]   it would certainly not cause that increase
[01:06:29.580 --> 01:06:30.560]   in metabolic rate.
[01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:34.980]   The group that was at 14 degrees Celsius,
[01:06:34.980 --> 01:06:39.140]   meaning 57.2 degrees Fahrenheit water for an hour,
[01:06:39.140 --> 01:06:42.780]   experienced a 350% increase in metabolism,
[01:06:42.780 --> 01:06:45.240]   so huge increases in metabolism.
[01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:48.680]   Now, the most interesting data to me,
[01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:50.520]   at least in terms of mental effects
[01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:52.420]   of deliberate cold exposure,
[01:06:52.420 --> 01:06:56.820]   were that the plasma or serum levels
[01:06:56.820 --> 01:07:01.620]   of norepinephrine in the blood increased 530%.
[01:07:01.620 --> 01:07:04.340]   These are huge increases in norepinephrine,
[01:07:04.340 --> 01:07:07.220]   so it suggests that this is a stressful stimulus,
[01:07:07.220 --> 01:07:10.020]   at least neurochemically speaking, stressful,
[01:07:10.020 --> 01:07:12.300]   despite the fact that it's not super, super cold,
[01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:15.980]   although 57.2 degrees Fahrenheit, 14 degrees Celsius,
[01:07:15.980 --> 01:07:20.380]   is not a, you know, it's not a warm environment,
[01:07:20.380 --> 01:07:22.580]   but it's not a ultra, ultra cold environment,
[01:07:22.580 --> 01:07:24.980]   but an hour is a very long time to be in there.
[01:07:24.980 --> 01:07:31.560]   The subjects also experienced a 250% increase
[01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:34.060]   in dopamine concentrations,
[01:07:34.060 --> 01:07:38.100]   which while not 530%, as it was with norepinephrine,
[01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:40.620]   is still a very large increase
[01:07:40.620 --> 01:07:42.460]   in baseline levels of dopamine.
[01:07:42.460 --> 01:07:44.780]   And what was interesting is that those increases
[01:07:44.780 --> 01:07:47.860]   in dopamine persisted for a very long period
[01:07:47.860 --> 01:07:51.500]   of time afterwards, even out to two hours, okay?
[01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:54.400]   And they stopped the study after 120 minutes
[01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:56.740]   of getting out of the cold,
[01:07:56.740 --> 01:07:59.860]   but nonetheless, these increases in norepinephrine
[01:07:59.860 --> 01:08:01.780]   are huge and long-lasting,
[01:08:01.780 --> 01:08:03.320]   and these increases in dopamine
[01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:05.800]   are very large and long-lasting.
[01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:08.860]   And I do believe that these documented effects in humans
[01:08:08.860 --> 01:08:12.340]   explain much of the enhancement of attention
[01:08:12.340 --> 01:08:14.380]   and of feelings of wellbeing and mood
[01:08:14.380 --> 01:08:16.380]   that people typically experience
[01:08:16.380 --> 01:08:19.080]   after doing deliberate cold exposure.
[01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:22.780]   And the reason I say that is that if you were to go back
[01:08:22.780 --> 01:08:24.740]   to the episode that I did on dopamine,
[01:08:24.740 --> 01:08:27.020]   or you were to go back to the episode that I did
[01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:29.740]   with Dr. Anna Lemke on addiction and dopamine,
[01:08:29.740 --> 01:08:32.820]   what you would find is that increases in dopamine
[01:08:32.820 --> 01:08:35.840]   of the sort evoked by deliberate cold exposure
[01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:38.100]   are actually very similar to the kinds of increases
[01:08:38.100 --> 01:08:41.380]   in dopamine that are elicited by things like nicotine
[01:08:41.380 --> 01:08:44.700]   or from other behaviors that are known to be addictive
[01:08:44.700 --> 01:08:47.620]   and bad for us because they lead to other effects
[01:08:47.620 --> 01:08:50.260]   on the brain and body that we simply don't want.
[01:08:50.260 --> 01:08:53.820]   And yet deliberate cold exposure, provided it's done safely,
[01:08:53.820 --> 01:08:57.620]   can create similar, if not greater, increases in dopamine
[01:08:57.620 --> 01:09:01.460]   that are not just fleeting, that don't just occur
[01:09:01.460 --> 01:09:04.140]   during, say, the consumption of some deleterious drug
[01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:06.440]   or activity, but that are very long-lasting
[01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:09.520]   and that can be leveraged toward activities
[01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:11.820]   other than deliberate cold exposure.
[01:09:11.820 --> 01:09:13.100]   So I want to emphasize this.
[01:09:13.100 --> 01:09:15.680]   I'm not suggesting that people do deliberate cold exposure
[01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:16.820]   for an hour a day.
[01:09:16.820 --> 01:09:19.680]   And unfortunately, there are not many studies
[01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:23.780]   yet exploring how shorter colder temperature
[01:09:23.780 --> 01:09:27.060]   environment exposure, say one minute or three minutes
[01:09:27.060 --> 01:09:32.060]   or six minutes at 55 degrees or at 50 degrees,
[01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:35.300]   whether or not that leads to similar, greater,
[01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:38.780]   or reduced levels of dopamine in the brain and body.
[01:09:38.780 --> 01:09:42.580]   And yet almost everybody who does deliberate cold exposure
[01:09:42.580 --> 01:09:45.660]   will say, yeah, it was stressful, I didn't enjoy it,
[01:09:45.660 --> 01:09:47.360]   or I eventually grew to like it,
[01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:49.620]   but that I always feel better afterwards.
[01:09:49.620 --> 01:09:52.660]   And then that feeling lasts a very long period of time.
[01:09:52.660 --> 01:09:56.100]   And I think it's almost certain that those experiences
[01:09:56.100 --> 01:09:58.820]   that people report relate to these increases in dopamine
[01:09:58.820 --> 01:10:01.980]   and in concert with the increases in norepinephrine
[01:10:01.980 --> 01:10:04.480]   also explain the other effect that's commonly reported,
[01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:06.940]   which is an enhancement in mental acuity
[01:10:06.940 --> 01:10:09.140]   and the ability to focus.
[01:10:09.140 --> 01:10:11.720]   Now, here we can extrapolate to the study
[01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:14.860]   that I discussed at the early part of the episode
[01:10:14.860 --> 01:10:15.900]   where I was talking about the use
[01:10:15.900 --> 01:10:18.120]   of short 15 minute exercise,
[01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:19.740]   kind of moderate intensity exercise,
[01:10:19.740 --> 01:10:22.740]   and how that was shown to increase levels of energy
[01:10:22.740 --> 01:10:25.180]   and mental acuity in these working memory
[01:10:25.180 --> 01:10:26.300]   visual attention tasks.
[01:10:26.300 --> 01:10:29.300]   And there again, we have to assume somewhat
[01:10:29.300 --> 01:10:31.460]   because they weren't doing neurochemical measurements,
[01:10:31.460 --> 01:10:35.240]   but we can reasonably assume that those improvements
[01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:38.380]   in cognitive performance were due, at least in part,
[01:10:38.380 --> 01:10:41.220]   to the increase in catecholamines known to accompany
[01:10:41.220 --> 01:10:43.720]   moderate intensity zone to cardio.
[01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:45.780]   So what you're starting to see here is a theme.
[01:10:45.780 --> 01:10:49.240]   The theme is that virtually any stimulus
[01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:51.660]   that delivers more norepinephrine, epinephrine,
[01:10:51.660 --> 01:10:54.640]   and dopamine to our system will sharpen our mental acuity
[01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:56.380]   and elevate our mood, and will do so
[01:10:56.380 --> 01:10:58.280]   for some period of time.
[01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:00.480]   Deliberate cold exposure, it turns out,
[01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:03.460]   is a very potent way to increase these catecholamines,
[01:11:03.460 --> 01:11:06.700]   this category of chemicals, and thereby to improve mood,
[01:11:06.700 --> 01:11:09.160]   mental acuity, and levels of alertness.
[01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:13.020]   And as we'll next see, it not only has that effect,
[01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:15.060]   which can be very beneficial for many people
[01:11:15.060 --> 01:11:16.900]   in a bunch of different circumstances,
[01:11:16.900 --> 01:11:20.960]   but it also has the positive effects that many people seek
[01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:24.300]   in terms of metabolism in lowering inflammation in the body
[01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:26.580]   and other physiological effects as well.
[01:11:26.580 --> 01:11:28.820]   And forgive me, I was almost ready to move on
[01:11:28.820 --> 01:11:32.740]   to effects of deliberate cold exposure on metabolism
[01:11:32.740 --> 01:11:34.280]   and inflammation and so forth,
[01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:36.660]   but I neglected to point out one of the other
[01:11:36.660 --> 01:11:39.920]   very interesting aspects of the study
[01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:41.680]   showing deliberate cold exposure
[01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:44.160]   can increase norepinephrine and dopamine,
[01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:48.140]   which is that they observed no significant increases
[01:11:48.140 --> 01:11:50.240]   in the stress hormone cortisol.
[01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:53.640]   And that is both surprising, interesting, and important,
[01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:57.460]   because what it means is that the quality of stress
[01:11:57.460 --> 01:12:00.740]   that deliberate cold exposure is creating in the body
[01:12:00.740 --> 01:12:04.520]   is likely to be one of what we call eustress.
[01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:07.400]   Hans Selye, the great physiologist,
[01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:10.800]   won a Nobel Prize for distinguishing between distress,
[01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:13.200]   which is stress in the brain and body
[01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:16.560]   that causes the release of things like cortisol
[01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:17.960]   along with the other catecholamines
[01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:20.720]   and that we experience as negative happening to us
[01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:22.880]   and can lead to negative health outcomes.
[01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:25.400]   And he distinguished that from eustress,
[01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:27.880]   which was stress that we now understand
[01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:29.720]   is associated with increases in things
[01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:31.440]   like norepinephrine and dopamine,
[01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:34.960]   but no increases or minimal increases in cortisol
[01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:37.560]   and that can lead to positive health outcomes.
[01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:40.360]   So it appears that deliberate cold exposure
[01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:44.800]   can create what we call or what Hans Selye called eustress.
[01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:46.560]   In other words, it can create a condition
[01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:49.860]   in the brain and body in which we are stressing ourselves,
[01:12:49.860 --> 01:12:51.200]   we are training up resilience,
[01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:54.140]   and yet we are creating a neurochemical milieu
[01:12:54.140 --> 01:12:56.380]   that actually has many health benefits.
[01:12:56.380 --> 01:12:57.600]   Now I'd like to shift our attention
[01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:00.780]   to the effects of deliberate cold exposure on metabolism.
[01:13:00.780 --> 01:13:03.320]   And I'd like to start by detailing a study
[01:13:03.320 --> 01:13:05.160]   that was performed on humans
[01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:07.740]   and published just at the end of last year.
[01:13:07.740 --> 01:13:08.800]   The title of the study is
[01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:10.840]   Altered Brown Fat Thermoregulation
[01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:13.620]   and Enhanced Cold Induced Thermogenesis
[01:13:13.620 --> 01:13:15.980]   in Young Healthy Winter Swimming Men.
[01:13:15.980 --> 01:13:17.760]   And I should point out that
[01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:20.600]   while the study was only performed on male subjects,
[01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:22.300]   there's no reason to think that
[01:13:22.300 --> 01:13:25.160]   the effects that they discovered would only pertain to men.
[01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:27.120]   I would hope that they would also do a study on women
[01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:28.800]   at some point in the future,
[01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:30.840]   but the effects that they describe
[01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:34.700]   are very basic core physiological processes.
[01:13:34.700 --> 01:13:37.200]   What they did is they looked at deliberate cold exposure
[01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:38.720]   in this group of young men,
[01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:42.960]   and they used that 11 minute threshold per week.
[01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:46.780]   So in other words, they had them get into cold water
[01:13:46.780 --> 01:13:50.160]   for approximately 11 minutes per week.
[01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:53.600]   And again, that's 11 minutes total per week.
[01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:56.000]   They divided that into two sessions,
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.760]   although in speaking with the first author of the study,
[01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:00.000]   Dr. Susanna Soberg,
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.320]   I learned that it probably is not important
[01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:03.500]   that it be two sessions,
[01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:06.280]   it could be three or even four sessions,
[01:14:06.280 --> 01:14:08.940]   as long as it reaches that 11 minute threshold.
[01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:11.520]   What they discovered was that
[01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:14.820]   by going into these cold environments,
[01:14:14.820 --> 01:14:17.960]   in this case, cold water immersion up to the neck
[01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:21.240]   for 11 minutes total per week,
[01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:23.800]   that these men experienced increases
[01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:26.660]   in so-called brown fat thermogenesis,
[01:14:26.660 --> 01:14:28.720]   I'll talk more about what that is in a moment,
[01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:30.800]   and increases in core body temperature
[01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:34.920]   that translate to increases in core body metabolism.
[01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:37.820]   Now, the overall increases in core body metabolism
[01:14:37.820 --> 01:14:42.820]   that they experienced were not extremely large.
[01:14:42.820 --> 01:14:44.600]   They were statistically significant,
[01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:45.960]   but they weren't extremely large.
[01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:50.400]   However, the changes in brown fat stores
[01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:53.080]   are perhaps what's most interesting about this study,
[01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:54.420]   and I'll tell you why.
[01:14:54.420 --> 01:14:57.580]   The metabolic increases of deliberate cold exposure
[01:14:57.580 --> 01:15:00.280]   are both acute, meaning happening in the short term,
[01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:02.900]   when you get into the cold and immediately after,
[01:15:02.900 --> 01:15:06.440]   one does experience an increase in core metabolism,
[01:15:06.440 --> 01:15:08.380]   you burn some calories, in other words,
[01:15:08.380 --> 01:15:14.520]   and while those might not be very significant increases,
[01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:17.740]   or I should say they can be statistically significant,
[01:15:17.740 --> 01:15:20.720]   but they are not enormously large numbers
[01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:21.800]   of calories burned,
[01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:27.200]   the longer lasting effects of deliberate cold exposure
[01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:30.680]   on metabolism seem to take place by changes that occur
[01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:34.100]   in the types of fat that we store in our body,
[01:15:34.100 --> 01:15:36.680]   and the way that that fat impacts our metabolism
[01:15:36.680 --> 01:15:40.120]   at other times throughout the 24-hour cycle.
[01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:44.660]   This actually has a somewhat anecdotal basis,
[01:15:44.660 --> 01:15:46.880]   in particular in Scandinavia.
[01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:49.440]   I don't speak Swedish nor I speak Danish,
[01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:51.160]   nor do I speak Norwegian,
[01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:52.960]   but I do have Danish relatives,
[01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:55.400]   and they were able to help me decipher
[01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:58.020]   a common Swedish saying,
[01:15:58.020 --> 01:16:01.120]   which essentially translates to the fact that
[01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:04.300]   in preparation for the summer, they say,
[01:16:04.300 --> 01:16:09.000]   one should expose themselves to warm environments
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:12.240]   so that one is comfortable in warm environments
[01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:13.120]   in the summer.
[01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:16.460]   That's one half of this traditional Swedish
[01:16:16.460 --> 01:16:17.940]   and also Danish saying.
[01:16:17.940 --> 01:16:22.380]   The other half of this traditional Danish Swedish saying
[01:16:22.380 --> 01:16:24.780]   is that in preparation for winter,
[01:16:24.780 --> 01:16:28.760]   in order to not feel too cold in cold environments,
[01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:31.300]   one should prepare for those in the fall
[01:16:31.300 --> 01:16:34.240]   by not wearing a jacket and exposing oneself
[01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:36.200]   to cold environments.
[01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:40.120]   Now, of course, this is just anecdotal cultural lore,
[01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:42.200]   but it actually has a physiological basis,
[01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:46.380]   which is by exposing oneself to cold environments
[01:16:46.380 --> 01:16:50.040]   on a repeated basis in anticipation of exposure
[01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:52.100]   to more extreme cold environments,
[01:16:52.100 --> 01:16:53.960]   one can feel more comfortable
[01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:56.000]   in those extreme cold environments.
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.180]   And that's exactly what they observed
[01:16:58.180 --> 01:17:00.380]   in this study by Soberg et al.
[01:17:00.380 --> 01:17:03.940]   The men felt more comfortable in extreme cold
[01:17:03.940 --> 01:17:07.360]   if they had trained through deliberate cold exposure,
[01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:09.880]   which might not seem surprising at all,
[01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:12.280]   but based on what we talked about earlier,
[01:17:12.280 --> 01:17:16.040]   whereby deliberate cold exposure evokes this discomfort
[01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:18.640]   and this experience of norepinephrine release,
[01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:20.700]   at least in the short term,
[01:17:20.700 --> 01:17:21.960]   then you would say, well,
[01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:23.260]   shouldn't that deliberate cold exposure
[01:17:23.260 --> 01:17:25.240]   also make them feel uncomfortable,
[01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:26.680]   like they really want to get out?
[01:17:26.680 --> 01:17:29.600]   Well, that is true at the beginning
[01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:31.420]   of a deliberate cold exposure protocol,
[01:17:31.420 --> 01:17:33.480]   meaning in the first week or in the second week
[01:17:33.480 --> 01:17:34.320]   or the third week.
[01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:36.320]   But what one finds and what you will find
[01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:38.980]   if you do deliberate cold exposure consistently
[01:17:38.980 --> 01:17:42.400]   is that you will then become more comfortable
[01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:44.560]   at cold temperatures
[01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:46.720]   away from the deliberate cold exposure.
[01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:49.180]   So, whereas you might have previously been the person
[01:17:49.180 --> 01:17:51.160]   who was always cold in the room with air conditioning
[01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:54.000]   or always seeking a sweater, always wanting to bundle up,
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.040]   you will be more comfortable in those cold environments.
[01:17:56.040 --> 01:17:59.960]   And the reason for that is well substantiated
[01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:03.240]   from this study and from animal studies,
[01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:06.240]   whereby deliberate cold exposure
[01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:09.520]   converts one particular kind of fat cell,
[01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:11.080]   the white fat cell,
[01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:15.280]   which is a very low metabolic output cell,
[01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:17.800]   it's basically a storage site for energy in the body,
[01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:21.260]   fat cells, to a different type of fat cell,
[01:18:21.260 --> 01:18:23.660]   which is the beige fat cell,
[01:18:23.660 --> 01:18:25.820]   called beige because it's actually beige
[01:18:25.820 --> 01:18:28.100]   or slightly brown under the microscope,
[01:18:28.100 --> 01:18:30.440]   or even to brown fat cells,
[01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:32.420]   which are very dark under the microscope
[01:18:32.420 --> 01:18:35.060]   and dark because they contain mitochondria
[01:18:35.060 --> 01:18:40.500]   and are very metabolically and thermogenically active.
[01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:43.860]   In other words, white fat doesn't burn many calories.
[01:18:43.860 --> 01:18:45.520]   It's basically a storage site.
[01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:47.600]   It's a bank account for energy.
[01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:52.220]   It's filled with lipids and those lipids can be used
[01:18:52.220 --> 01:18:53.480]   if the body needs energy
[01:18:53.480 --> 01:18:55.680]   and if it goes into a caloric deficit.
[01:18:55.680 --> 01:18:59.660]   Beige fat and brown fat acts as sort of a furnace
[01:18:59.660 --> 01:19:03.400]   or the sort of fat that you would find in a candle,
[01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:06.100]   a fuel that can increase core body temperature.
[01:19:06.100 --> 01:19:08.360]   So beige fat and brown fat
[01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:11.040]   is very good at raising our metabolism
[01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:13.320]   and helps burn white fat.
[01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:15.080]   Now, of course, it does that
[01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:18.340]   only in the context of a caloric deficit,
[01:19:18.340 --> 01:19:21.960]   but it can actually help create that caloric deficit.
[01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:24.560]   Having more beige fat and brown fat
[01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:27.300]   can increase your overall core metabolism.
[01:19:27.300 --> 01:19:29.040]   In other words, the number of calories
[01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:30.320]   that you burn per day,
[01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:31.700]   and therefore the number of calories
[01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:34.700]   that you need to either maintain or to lose weight.
[01:19:34.700 --> 01:19:37.420]   The simple translation of this
[01:19:37.420 --> 01:19:40.060]   is that getting into cold water
[01:19:40.060 --> 01:19:43.040]   for a total of 11 minutes, perhaps more,
[01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:44.980]   but at least 11 minutes per week
[01:19:44.980 --> 01:19:47.720]   divided into two or four sessions
[01:19:47.720 --> 01:19:50.520]   can increase your core metabolism in part
[01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:54.200]   by increasing your beige and brown fat stores.
[01:19:54.200 --> 01:19:57.400]   And we know how that works, at least in animal models.
[01:19:57.400 --> 01:19:59.280]   And there's now reason to suspect
[01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:02.320]   that the exact same mechanisms are occurring in humans.
[01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:05.340]   The primary way in which deliberate cold exposure
[01:20:05.340 --> 01:20:08.480]   converts white fat cells into these more metabolically,
[01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:11.720]   thermogenically active metabolism-increasing
[01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:14.220]   beige and brown fat cells
[01:20:14.220 --> 01:20:19.220]   is because norepinephrine released when we get into the cold
[01:20:19.220 --> 01:20:25.000]   binds to receptors on the surface of white fat cells
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:30.000]   and activates downstream pathways such as UCP1.
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.640]   So this is an uncoupling protein one
[01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:35.500]   that acts on the mitochondrial metabolism of cells
[01:20:35.500 --> 01:20:39.060]   and increases the mitochondrial output of those cells
[01:20:39.060 --> 01:20:41.340]   and the mitochondrial density of those cells.
[01:20:41.340 --> 01:20:43.520]   In other words, it takes a cell
[01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:46.140]   that has a kind of a weak engine
[01:20:46.140 --> 01:20:48.860]   or no engine for generating energy,
[01:20:48.860 --> 01:20:51.060]   although every cell has some mitochondria,
[01:20:51.060 --> 01:20:53.620]   it takes cells that have very few mitochondria
[01:20:53.620 --> 01:20:56.320]   and increases the engine size.
[01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:59.960]   It kind of stokes the furnace of those particular cells
[01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:03.480]   and actually can change gene expression in those cells.
[01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:04.640]   So that's what's really interesting.
[01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:08.420]   Deliberate cold exposure causes increases in norepinephrine,
[01:21:08.420 --> 01:21:12.680]   which bind to receptors on the surfaces of white fat cells,
[01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:16.320]   which triggers the release of things like UCP1.
[01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:19.680]   It also causes the release of things like PPAR gamma
[01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:22.040]   and cofactor PGC1.
[01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:23.540]   I'm going to refer you to a review
[01:21:23.540 --> 01:21:25.440]   if you want to learn more about these.
[01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:26.840]   For those of you that don't want to learn more,
[01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:29.600]   all you need to know is that the downstream of all that
[01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:32.400]   are increases in mitochondria and metabolism
[01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:36.240]   and actual genetic changes in the white fat cells
[01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:39.480]   that convert them into beige and brown fat cells.
[01:21:39.480 --> 01:21:41.400]   This is especially important for adults
[01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:44.740]   because babies and young children
[01:21:44.740 --> 01:21:47.760]   actually don't have the ability to shiver
[01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:51.520]   or they have a less robust capacity to shiver.
[01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:53.440]   Very small babies really can't shiver,
[01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:56.400]   so they have a lot of brown fat in order to keep them warm.
[01:21:57.440 --> 01:22:00.340]   Young children eventually develop the ability to shiver
[01:22:00.340 --> 01:22:02.920]   and maintain these brown fat stores,
[01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:04.720]   mainly around the clavicles, the heart,
[01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:07.660]   the upper spine, and in the upper back.
[01:22:07.660 --> 01:22:10.840]   And it's no coincidence that kids can often run around
[01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:12.520]   with a minimal of clothing and be comfortable
[01:22:12.520 --> 01:22:15.240]   in environments that adults would be cold in.
[01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:21.000]   As life goes on, we tend to lose beige and brown fat,
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.680]   but this mechanism that I'm referring to
[01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:25.660]   points to the plasticity of white fat,
[01:22:25.660 --> 01:22:27.040]   meaning the ability for white fat
[01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:28.580]   to actually convert its identity
[01:22:28.580 --> 01:22:32.100]   into this metabolically thermogenically enhancing form
[01:22:32.100 --> 01:22:33.900]   of beige and brown fat.
[01:22:33.900 --> 01:22:36.520]   So deliberate cold exposure is a terrific way
[01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:38.440]   to increase your core metabolism.
[01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:39.880]   And oftentimes critics will say,
[01:22:39.880 --> 01:22:42.540]   well, the increase in metabolism isn't that significant,
[01:22:42.540 --> 01:22:44.440]   although I do want to point out again,
[01:22:44.440 --> 01:22:49.440]   the 93% and the 350% increases in metabolism
[01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:51.040]   from that previous study.
[01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:53.180]   But critics then will say,
[01:22:53.180 --> 01:22:54.920]   well, that doesn't really translate
[01:22:54.920 --> 01:22:59.000]   to that big of a caloric burn
[01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:00.960]   during the deliberate cold exposure.
[01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:02.680]   But to that, you should say, ah,
[01:23:02.680 --> 01:23:04.840]   but that's only limiting your optics
[01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:06.280]   to just a portion of the effects
[01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:07.780]   of deliberate cold exposure,
[01:23:07.780 --> 01:23:09.080]   because deliberate cold exposure
[01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:12.840]   can also convert white fat to beige fat and brown fat
[01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:17.000]   and lead to these more lasting increases in metabolism.
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.680]   So for any of you interested in increasing your metabolism
[01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:22.480]   and/or being comfortable in cold environments
[01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:25.600]   and/or being comfortable in terms of being able
[01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:27.520]   to combat stress mentally,
[01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:30.960]   deliberate cold exposure I do believe is a powerful tool.
[01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:33.560]   And there is simply no reason why you couldn't
[01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:35.800]   and shouldn't use the same protocols
[01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:38.520]   that I described earlier for building resilience
[01:23:38.520 --> 01:23:39.920]   to increase metabolism.
[01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:43.400]   Provided you're hitting that 11 minute per week threshold,
[01:23:43.400 --> 01:23:46.160]   you ought to be stimulating both mechanisms,
[01:23:46.160 --> 01:23:51.160]   increases in resilience and increases in core metabolism.
[01:23:51.800 --> 01:23:53.820]   As I mentioned earlier, most of the detailed studies
[01:23:53.820 --> 01:23:57.080]   on the conversion of white fat to beige fat and brown fat
[01:23:57.080 --> 01:23:59.520]   through the use of cold have been done in animal models,
[01:23:59.520 --> 01:24:01.480]   but the human data are starting to emerge.
[01:24:01.480 --> 01:24:04.200]   And if you'd like to do the deep dive into these mechanisms,
[01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:07.220]   things like UCP1, PPAR gamma, et cetera,
[01:24:07.220 --> 01:24:09.640]   there's a beautiful review that was published recently
[01:24:09.640 --> 01:24:10.600]   in the journal Cell,
[01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:12.120]   which is one of the three apex journals,
[01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:13.680]   Nature Science Cell.
[01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:15.680]   And the title of that paper is
[01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:18.140]   Adipose Tissue Plasticity in Health and Disease.
[01:24:18.140 --> 01:24:19.440]   I love this review.
[01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:22.760]   It has beautiful diagrams detailing all of the pathways
[01:24:22.760 --> 01:24:26.460]   from cold to norepinephrine through UCP1,
[01:24:26.460 --> 01:24:28.200]   downstream of things like cyclic AMP.
[01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:30.240]   If none of those names mean anything to you,
[01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:31.080]   don't worry about it.
[01:24:31.080 --> 01:24:32.840]   You certainly don't need to know these mechanisms
[01:24:32.840 --> 01:24:35.760]   to benefit from deliberate cold exposure protocols.
[01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:38.140]   If those names do mean something to you
[01:24:38.140 --> 01:24:41.160]   or you're interested in exploring the downstream effects
[01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:43.600]   of deliberate cold exposure and something else
[01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:45.600]   that's really nice that's covered in this paper
[01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:48.040]   is how deliberate cold exposure interacts
[01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:51.720]   with fasted states and fed states.
[01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:54.280]   I think you'll also find this review very interesting.
[01:24:54.280 --> 01:24:56.320]   I don't want to go too deeply into fasted states
[01:24:56.320 --> 01:24:58.080]   and fed states right now.
[01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:00.440]   Suffice to say that when we are fasted,
[01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:03.020]   meaning when we haven't eaten for some period of time,
[01:25:03.020 --> 01:25:07.100]   our baseline levels of norepinephrine and epinephrine
[01:25:07.100 --> 01:25:08.960]   are already elevated.
[01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:11.360]   And so cold exposure at those times
[01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:13.880]   ought to have an even greater effect
[01:25:13.880 --> 01:25:16.480]   on metabolism and resilience and so on.
[01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:20.400]   So for you fasters or your intermittent fasters out there,
[01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:21.860]   if you really want to get fancy,
[01:25:21.860 --> 01:25:25.560]   you can do your deliberate cold exposure when you are fasted.
[01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:27.120]   I certainly wouldn't recommend doing it
[01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:29.460]   with a very full stomach in any case.
[01:25:29.460 --> 01:25:32.960]   And as I mentioned before on this podcast,
[01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:36.200]   intermittent fasting is but one way,
[01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:37.520]   and certainly there are other ways
[01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:40.660]   to limit total caloric intake for sake of maintaining
[01:25:40.660 --> 01:25:43.120]   or losing weight if that's your goal.
[01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:45.480]   I know many people are using and benefit
[01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:47.400]   from intermittent fasting, however,
[01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:49.680]   and so it certainly can be combined
[01:25:49.680 --> 01:25:51.160]   with deliberate cold exposures
[01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:53.000]   in order to get even greater increases
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:54.860]   in norepinephrine and epinephrine.
[01:25:54.860 --> 01:25:57.100]   So for those of you that are primarily interested
[01:25:57.100 --> 01:25:58.560]   in using deliberate cold exposure
[01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:02.220]   to increase dopamine levels in your brain and body,
[01:26:02.220 --> 01:26:04.520]   you can also do a combined protocol
[01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:09.140]   whereby you ingest caffeine 60 to 120 minutes
[01:26:09.140 --> 01:26:11.720]   before the deliberate cold exposure.
[01:26:11.720 --> 01:26:14.660]   This is based on a study that I've talked about before
[01:26:14.660 --> 01:26:17.540]   entitled Caffeine Increases Striatal Dopamine
[01:26:17.540 --> 01:26:20.400]   D2, D3 Receptor Availability in the Human Brain.
[01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:23.760]   And as the title suggests, this study was done on humans,
[01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:27.560]   looking at the density and or efficacy
[01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:29.840]   of these dopamine receptors in an area of the brain
[01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:32.500]   called the striatum, which is involved in planning and action
[01:26:32.500 --> 01:26:34.320]   and also suppressing planning and action.
[01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:37.580]   It's involved very closely with whether or not
[01:26:37.580 --> 01:26:41.080]   we can engage in behavior and withhold behavior,
[01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:44.240]   the so-called go and no-go pathways in the brain.
[01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:45.820]   Dopamine plays a critical role in that
[01:26:45.820 --> 01:26:48.360]   and many other things as well, as you now know.
[01:26:48.360 --> 01:26:52.620]   So why would you want to ingest caffeine 60 to 120 minutes
[01:26:52.620 --> 01:26:55.020]   before deliberate cold exposure?
[01:26:55.020 --> 01:26:57.760]   Well, as I talked about earlier,
[01:26:57.760 --> 01:27:00.260]   dopamine can increase quite substantially
[01:27:00.260 --> 01:27:02.180]   in response to deliberate cold exposure,
[01:27:02.180 --> 01:27:04.000]   but dopamine on its own doesn't do anything.
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:05.980]   It has to bind to receptors.
[01:27:05.980 --> 01:27:08.680]   And this paper shows quite definitively
[01:27:08.680 --> 01:27:10.340]   that ingesting caffeine, in this case,
[01:27:10.340 --> 01:27:12.360]   it was 300 milligram dose of caffeine,
[01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:14.160]   which is about the dose of caffeine
[01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:15.440]   in two or three cups of coffee.
[01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:17.560]   It depends on the strength of the coffee, of course,
[01:27:17.560 --> 01:27:19.800]   but it's not an outrageous amount of caffeine.
[01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:23.800]   That increases the density and or efficacy
[01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:25.820]   of these receptors, which would allow that dopamine
[01:27:25.820 --> 01:27:28.820]   to have its greatest effect.
[01:27:28.820 --> 01:27:31.120]   And for those of you that want to get really, really fancy,
[01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:32.580]   I suppose you could do this fasted,
[01:27:32.580 --> 01:27:35.000]   so you get the further increase in norepinephrine,
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.200]   then you get the dopamine increase from the cold exposure,
[01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:38.880]   the binding of the dopamine.
[01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:42.120]   Although I do want to point out that at some point,
[01:27:42.120 --> 01:27:44.080]   you start layering together enough protocols
[01:27:44.080 --> 01:27:45.680]   that you would be spending your entire day
[01:27:45.680 --> 01:27:47.080]   trying to get this dopamine pulse.
[01:27:47.080 --> 01:27:49.560]   And I would hope that you would have other activities
[01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:50.780]   that you would engage in.
[01:27:50.780 --> 01:27:53.760]   But if you're getting up in the morning and you're fasted
[01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:55.040]   because you haven't eaten all night
[01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:57.360]   and you have a cup of coffee, and then 60 minutes later,
[01:27:57.360 --> 01:28:00.500]   you take your cold shower, or two hours later,
[01:28:00.500 --> 01:28:02.880]   you do your cold immersion or your cold shower,
[01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:05.840]   you would be layering together these different mechanisms
[01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:07.960]   of dopamine receptors, epinephrine, and so forth
[01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:11.240]   in a way that at least to me doesn't seem incompatible
[01:28:11.240 --> 01:28:13.280]   with having some other life, like going to school
[01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:15.040]   and having relationships, et cetera.
[01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:16.720]   And this increase in dopamine,
[01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:20.740]   particularly in the striatum, is not a trivial one.
[01:28:20.740 --> 01:28:23.160]   I do want to point out, as the authors do,
[01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:25.620]   that preclinical studies have shown that increases
[01:28:25.620 --> 01:28:29.400]   in striatal dopamine induced by things like modafinil,
[01:28:29.400 --> 01:28:33.280]   which is used to treat ADHD and treat narcolepsy,
[01:28:33.280 --> 01:28:36.120]   is necessary for their wake-promoting actions.
[01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:38.640]   What this really says is that just having elevated levels
[01:28:38.640 --> 01:28:41.200]   of dopamine from a drug or from an ice bath
[01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:43.280]   or what have you is not sufficient
[01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:44.560]   to get the effects of dopamine.
[01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:47.400]   You really need the receptors to be available,
[01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:49.040]   and you need those receptors to be available
[01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:50.440]   in the appropriate density,
[01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:52.560]   and you need those receptors to be available
[01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:55.320]   in the appropriate density in the striatum in particular.
[01:28:55.320 --> 01:28:57.500]   So I think there are a number of reasons why,
[01:28:57.500 --> 01:29:00.560]   if it's compatible with the other aspects of your health,
[01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:02.280]   'cause of course always you have to consider this
[01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:03.920]   on a background of cardiovascular health
[01:29:03.920 --> 01:29:05.160]   and blood pressure, et cetera,
[01:29:05.160 --> 01:29:07.240]   that ingesting a cup or two of coffee
[01:29:07.240 --> 01:29:11.240]   an hour before your ice bath, maybe fasted as well,
[01:29:11.240 --> 01:29:13.520]   could be quite beneficial for increasing dopamine
[01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:15.640]   over quite extended periods of time.
[01:29:15.640 --> 01:29:18.380]   A couple of key points that you'll want to pay attention to
[01:29:18.380 --> 01:29:21.280]   in thinking about deliberate cold exposure and metabolism.
[01:29:21.280 --> 01:29:25.240]   In the Soberg study, they also explored the use of sauna
[01:29:25.240 --> 01:29:27.960]   and how to use sauna, meaning deliberate heat,
[01:29:27.960 --> 01:29:30.400]   in conjunction with cold.
[01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:32.240]   We are going to do an entire episode
[01:29:32.240 --> 01:29:34.640]   about the use of heat for health and performance.
[01:29:34.640 --> 01:29:37.160]   So that is not the focus now.
[01:29:37.160 --> 01:29:40.160]   However, it does raise an important point
[01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:42.100]   that we do need to address at this moment,
[01:29:42.100 --> 01:29:44.960]   which is if you are using sauna
[01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:47.320]   or if you are taking warm showers,
[01:29:47.320 --> 01:29:50.040]   or if you're simply using deliberate cold exposure
[01:29:50.040 --> 01:29:54.000]   of any kind, should you get into the heat afterward
[01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:55.840]   or before or not at all?
[01:29:55.840 --> 01:29:58.440]   And this is where we can point
[01:29:58.440 --> 01:30:00.680]   to the so-called Soberg principle,
[01:30:00.680 --> 01:30:02.320]   at least I call it the Soberg principle.
[01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:04.240]   The Soberg principle named after first author
[01:30:04.240 --> 01:30:06.680]   of this study I referred to earlier,
[01:30:06.680 --> 01:30:08.060]   Dr. Susanna Soberg.
[01:30:08.060 --> 01:30:12.960]   In science, it is appropriate to take a key piece of data
[01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:14.480]   and call it a principle,
[01:30:14.480 --> 01:30:16.500]   if in fact it translates to something larger,
[01:30:16.500 --> 01:30:18.160]   which I believe it does.
[01:30:18.160 --> 01:30:20.040]   It is generally not appropriate
[01:30:20.040 --> 01:30:21.960]   for people to name a principle after themselves,
[01:30:21.960 --> 01:30:25.380]   although there are a few scientists that have done that.
[01:30:25.380 --> 01:30:27.000]   So I have named it the Soberg principle,
[01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:30.280]   but I did that to give it appropriate credit
[01:30:30.280 --> 01:30:33.760]   to Dr. Susanna Soberg, who discovered that
[01:30:33.760 --> 01:30:36.240]   and pointed out quite appropriately
[01:30:36.240 --> 01:30:40.380]   that to achieve the greatest increases in metabolism
[01:30:40.380 --> 01:30:42.720]   through deliberate cold exposure,
[01:30:42.720 --> 01:30:47.460]   you want to force yourself to reheat on your own
[01:30:47.460 --> 01:30:49.240]   after the deliberate cold exposure,
[01:30:49.240 --> 01:30:52.120]   meaning you wouldn't want to go from the cold shower
[01:30:52.120 --> 01:30:54.820]   to a hot shower or from the cold shower to a sauna.
[01:30:54.820 --> 01:30:57.140]   Rather, if you were going to start with a hot shower
[01:30:57.140 --> 01:30:58.720]   or you're going to start with a sauna,
[01:30:58.720 --> 01:31:01.000]   that you would end with the cold
[01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.800]   and then you would reheat naturally.
[01:31:03.800 --> 01:31:06.080]   Now, I personally take a cold shower
[01:31:06.080 --> 01:31:08.280]   a few times a week or do cold immersion.
[01:31:08.280 --> 01:31:10.720]   And because I'm not specifically focused
[01:31:10.720 --> 01:31:13.880]   on increasing metabolism, although I probably should be,
[01:31:13.880 --> 01:31:16.440]   that's not what I'm using it for now,
[01:31:16.440 --> 01:31:18.040]   I will take a hot shower afterwards.
[01:31:18.040 --> 01:31:19.880]   And in doing so, I'm short-circuiting
[01:31:19.880 --> 01:31:22.760]   some of the further metabolic increases that I would achieve
[01:31:22.760 --> 01:31:25.160]   were I to just end with the cold.
[01:31:25.160 --> 01:31:27.700]   So the Soberg principle is,
[01:31:27.700 --> 01:31:31.520]   if you want to increase your metabolism, end with cold.
[01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:34.560]   And we can take this a step further and say
[01:31:34.560 --> 01:31:36.980]   that if you want to use deliberate cold exposure
[01:31:36.980 --> 01:31:40.920]   to increase metabolism, that you should make sure
[01:31:40.920 --> 01:31:43.600]   that you get to the point where you shiver.
[01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:46.400]   And the reason for this is that there are a series of studies
[01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:48.960]   but in particular one study published in the journal Nature,
[01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:51.720]   excellent journal in the year 2018,
[01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:55.700]   showing that deliberate cold exposure
[01:31:55.700 --> 01:31:59.160]   that evokes shivering from the muscles
[01:31:59.160 --> 01:32:02.080]   causes the release of a molecule called succinate
[01:32:02.080 --> 01:32:06.160]   from the muscles, and that succinate plays a key role
[01:32:06.160 --> 01:32:08.820]   in activating brown fat thermogenesis,
[01:32:08.820 --> 01:32:10.960]   which you now have heard about and understand
[01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:13.120]   as critical to the increases in metabolism
[01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:15.840]   caused by deliberate cold exposure.
[01:32:15.840 --> 01:32:17.520]   So what this means is if you want to increase
[01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:20.280]   your metabolism, end on cold, that's the Soberg principle,
[01:32:20.280 --> 01:32:23.160]   and as best you can try and get to the point
[01:32:23.160 --> 01:32:25.940]   where you are shivering either when you are
[01:32:25.940 --> 01:32:29.240]   in the cold exposure or immediately afterwards.
[01:32:29.240 --> 01:32:32.600]   Now, one efficient way to do this is to, for instance,
[01:32:32.600 --> 01:32:36.080]   you could get into the cold shower for a minute
[01:32:36.080 --> 01:32:38.920]   or two minutes or three minutes, uncomfortably cold,
[01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:40.060]   but safe to stay in.
[01:32:40.060 --> 01:32:42.260]   Remember, that's our general rule of thumb.
[01:32:42.260 --> 01:32:45.440]   Then turn off the water and stand there.
[01:32:45.440 --> 01:32:47.800]   Make sure that you're not holding yourself
[01:32:47.800 --> 01:32:48.640]   close to your body.
[01:32:48.640 --> 01:32:50.760]   You're not hugging yourself to try and keep yourself warm,
[01:32:50.760 --> 01:32:53.920]   but rather your limbs are extended at your sides.
[01:32:53.920 --> 01:32:56.880]   And then if that fails to induce shiver,
[01:32:56.880 --> 01:32:59.660]   then to turn on the cold water again
[01:32:59.660 --> 01:33:00.920]   and then turn it off again.
[01:33:00.920 --> 01:33:03.000]   So alternating perhaps a minute to three minutes
[01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.520]   of cold exposure followed by a minute to three minutes
[01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:09.320]   of drying out in air and going back into the cold exposure,
[01:33:09.320 --> 01:33:10.620]   et cetera.
[01:33:10.620 --> 01:33:12.140]   I can tell you this from experience.
[01:33:12.140 --> 01:33:14.100]   This is a pretty brutal protocol.
[01:33:14.100 --> 01:33:18.680]   If you have never tried getting into an ice bath
[01:33:18.680 --> 01:33:21.560]   or cold water immersion or cold shower for one minute
[01:33:21.560 --> 01:33:23.340]   and then getting out and trying to stand there
[01:33:23.340 --> 01:33:26.080]   with your arms extended in cool or cold air
[01:33:26.080 --> 01:33:28.800]   for one minute and then getting back into the cold shower
[01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:32.400]   or water immersion, you are in for an experience
[01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:34.280]   because even for those of you
[01:33:34.280 --> 01:33:36.080]   that are pretty shiver resistant,
[01:33:36.080 --> 01:33:38.240]   you will find that it is much, much harder
[01:33:38.240 --> 01:33:41.880]   to get out of that cold water and stand their arms extended
[01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:43.780]   and drying off by evaporation,
[01:33:43.780 --> 01:33:46.600]   which further draws heat from the body
[01:33:46.600 --> 01:33:48.240]   than it is to wrap yourself in a towel,
[01:33:48.240 --> 01:33:50.160]   get in a warm shower or a sauna.
[01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:54.040]   So there's certainly no requirement to end on cold.
[01:33:54.040 --> 01:33:57.600]   There's certainly no requirement to induce shiver.
[01:33:57.600 --> 01:34:01.720]   But if your primary goal is to induce increases
[01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:05.120]   in metabolism, both in the short-term and in the long-term
[01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:06.660]   following the cold exposure,
[01:34:06.660 --> 01:34:07.960]   well, then you'll want to end on cold
[01:34:07.960 --> 01:34:10.520]   and you'll want to find a way to shiver
[01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:12.780]   provided that the level of cold
[01:34:12.780 --> 01:34:14.080]   that you're exposing yourself to
[01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:15.840]   is still safe for you overall.
[01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:17.080]   So up until now, I've been talking
[01:34:17.080 --> 01:34:20.000]   about deliberate cold exposure as a potent stimulus
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.820]   for the release of norepinephrine in the brain and body.
[01:34:22.820 --> 01:34:24.400]   And indeed it is.
[01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:26.680]   But the way I've been describing it
[01:34:26.680 --> 01:34:30.740]   has been in the context of circulating plasma levels
[01:34:30.740 --> 01:34:33.640]   of norepinephrine, meaning circulating within the blood.
[01:34:33.640 --> 01:34:37.680]   What I haven't mentioned, but is absolutely true,
[01:34:37.680 --> 01:34:41.700]   is that the fat cells themselves
[01:34:41.700 --> 01:34:44.700]   actually receive input from neurons.
[01:34:44.700 --> 01:34:47.500]   So there are neurons that release norepinephrine
[01:34:47.500 --> 01:34:51.060]   in response to cold directly into the fat.
[01:34:51.060 --> 01:34:53.440]   So I want to give you this picture
[01:34:53.440 --> 01:34:55.820]   of how the architecture of all this works,
[01:34:55.820 --> 01:34:57.980]   because I think it can help you navigate
[01:34:57.980 --> 01:35:01.780]   and indeed build better deliberate cold exposure protocols.
[01:35:01.780 --> 01:35:05.320]   Your adrenal glands release norepinephrine and epinephrine.
[01:35:05.320 --> 01:35:08.920]   Your brain has sites within it like the locus coeruleus
[01:35:08.920 --> 01:35:12.000]   that release norepinephrine and epinephrine.
[01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:16.160]   But there are also neurons within your skin that sense cold
[01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:19.380]   and other neurons that can directly release norepinephrine
[01:35:19.380 --> 01:35:22.640]   into the fat stores and cause those white fat cells
[01:35:22.640 --> 01:35:24.400]   to convert to beige and brown fat.
[01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:26.920]   And I think this particular aspect of our physiology
[01:35:26.920 --> 01:35:29.720]   is often overlooked in studies.
[01:35:29.720 --> 01:35:31.140]   And when people say, oh, well,
[01:35:31.140 --> 01:35:33.600]   the increases in metabolism aren't that great,
[01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:35.320]   the circulating levels of norepinephrine,
[01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:39.180]   those are very large, but they're very transient and so on,
[01:35:39.180 --> 01:35:42.960]   that fails to understand that neurons
[01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:46.840]   that actually sense cold are in a position to communicate
[01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:49.940]   via other neurons directly to the fat cells
[01:35:49.940 --> 01:35:51.860]   and release norepinephrine into those fat cells,
[01:35:51.860 --> 01:35:53.540]   which as I pointed out earlier,
[01:35:53.540 --> 01:35:56.800]   set off a huge set of immediate and long-term cascades
[01:35:56.800 --> 01:35:58.880]   of even gene expression changes.
[01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:02.040]   So the picture that I'd like you to have in your mind
[01:36:02.040 --> 01:36:04.140]   is that when you get into the cold,
[01:36:04.140 --> 01:36:07.760]   yes, of course you experience that as a experience of,
[01:36:07.760 --> 01:36:09.540]   I don't want to do this, I'm going to overcome this,
[01:36:09.540 --> 01:36:11.300]   I'm going to climb over these mental walls
[01:36:11.300 --> 01:36:14.020]   that represent adrenaline release in my brain and body,
[01:36:14.020 --> 01:36:17.940]   but also that your fat cells are receiving signals,
[01:36:17.940 --> 01:36:21.020]   norepinephrine signals that are changing those fat cells
[01:36:21.020 --> 01:36:22.860]   in the way that they metabolize energy.
[01:36:22.860 --> 01:36:24.180]   Now I'd like to shift our attention
[01:36:24.180 --> 01:36:26.240]   to the use of deliberate cold exposure
[01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:28.740]   for sake of physical performance.
[01:36:28.740 --> 01:36:30.420]   And there are a lot of opinions out there
[01:36:30.420 --> 01:36:32.440]   about the use of deliberate cold,
[01:36:32.440 --> 01:36:33.980]   whether or not it should be done, for instance,
[01:36:33.980 --> 01:36:36.160]   before or after exercise,
[01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:39.700]   whether or not if done immediately after strength training
[01:36:39.700 --> 01:36:40.800]   or hypertrophy training,
[01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:43.440]   meaning training designed to grow muscles
[01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:44.340]   or make them stronger,
[01:36:44.340 --> 01:36:46.140]   whether or not it can inhibit that process
[01:36:46.140 --> 01:36:47.600]   and so on and so forth.
[01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:50.640]   I think today in looking over the literature
[01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:52.700]   and trying to bring forward the simplest
[01:36:52.700 --> 01:36:53.600]   and most straightforward
[01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:56.000]   and yet scientifically grounded protocols,
[01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.060]   we can set up some general guidelines
[01:36:58.060 --> 01:37:00.140]   that will allow most if not all of you
[01:37:00.140 --> 01:37:03.300]   to still extract the benefits of deliberate cold exposure
[01:37:03.300 --> 01:37:05.040]   on physical performance
[01:37:05.040 --> 01:37:08.380]   without getting too neurotic about the exact timing.
[01:37:08.380 --> 01:37:10.660]   But for sake of discussion
[01:37:10.660 --> 01:37:14.860]   and because it's a prominent theme in many online communities
[01:37:14.860 --> 01:37:18.140]   let's just start with the big one out there,
[01:37:18.140 --> 01:37:21.960]   meaning the question of whether or not doing an ice bath
[01:37:21.960 --> 01:37:23.680]   or doing deliberate cold exposure
[01:37:23.680 --> 01:37:28.260]   or taking a cold shower after strength/hypertrophy training,
[01:37:28.260 --> 01:37:30.640]   meaning training designed to increase strength
[01:37:30.640 --> 01:37:34.120]   and/or I should say the size of muscles
[01:37:34.120 --> 01:37:37.800]   will somehow short circuit or diminish that process,
[01:37:37.800 --> 01:37:39.340]   whether or not it will reduce
[01:37:39.340 --> 01:37:42.100]   or eliminate those strength gains and hypertrophy gains.
[01:37:42.100 --> 01:37:45.040]   And the short answer that I was able to arrive at
[01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:47.500]   on the basis of a review article
[01:37:47.500 --> 01:37:48.980]   that I'll talk about in a moment
[01:37:48.980 --> 01:37:51.140]   and some other studies as well
[01:37:51.140 --> 01:37:56.140]   is that if your main goal is hypertrophy and strength,
[01:37:56.140 --> 01:38:00.460]   it is probably best to avoid cold water immersion
[01:38:00.460 --> 01:38:04.340]   and ice bath immersion in the four hours
[01:38:04.340 --> 01:38:06.860]   immediately following that strength
[01:38:06.860 --> 01:38:08.660]   and/or hypertrophy training.
[01:38:08.660 --> 01:38:12.860]   Again, if your main goal is to achieve hypertrophy
[01:38:12.860 --> 01:38:15.900]   or strength or some combination of those,
[01:38:15.900 --> 01:38:20.140]   probably best to avoid cold water immersion up to the neck
[01:38:20.140 --> 01:38:23.020]   or ice bath immersion up to the neck
[01:38:23.020 --> 01:38:26.100]   immediately after strength and hypertrophy training
[01:38:26.100 --> 01:38:30.100]   and extending out to about four hours after that training.
[01:38:30.100 --> 01:38:32.940]   If you're really neurotic about this,
[01:38:32.940 --> 01:38:35.480]   then perhaps you'd want to move the cold water exposure
[01:38:35.480 --> 01:38:37.140]   to a different day entirely,
[01:38:37.140 --> 01:38:39.800]   but it all depends on how neurotically attached you are
[01:38:39.800 --> 01:38:42.380]   to getting every last bit of strength and hypertrophy.
[01:38:42.380 --> 01:38:44.060]   And if that's your goal, terrific,
[01:38:44.060 --> 01:38:47.160]   well then probably moving the cold exposure
[01:38:47.160 --> 01:38:49.040]   four hours or more away from that training
[01:38:49.040 --> 01:38:50.700]   is going to be necessary for you.
[01:38:50.700 --> 01:38:53.700]   Now you'll notice I did not talk about cold showers.
[01:38:53.700 --> 01:38:55.820]   And the reason I did not talk about cold showers
[01:38:55.820 --> 01:38:59.340]   is that there simply are not very many studies
[01:38:59.340 --> 01:39:01.940]   of deliberate cold exposure through cold showers
[01:39:01.940 --> 01:39:03.040]   for the reasons I talked about
[01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:05.100]   at the beginning of the episode.
[01:39:05.100 --> 01:39:08.380]   It's hard for me to imagine that taking a brief cold shower
[01:39:08.380 --> 01:39:11.020]   after a strength or hypertrophy training session
[01:39:11.020 --> 01:39:13.240]   would completely reverse or short circuit
[01:39:13.240 --> 01:39:15.480]   the effects of that strength and hypertrophy training.
[01:39:15.480 --> 01:39:17.860]   But again, if you're neurotically attached
[01:39:17.860 --> 01:39:21.100]   to getting every last bit of strength and hypertrophy
[01:39:21.100 --> 01:39:22.580]   out of your training sessions,
[01:39:22.580 --> 01:39:24.800]   then by all means, err on the side of caution
[01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:27.460]   and wait four hours or more to do your cold shower
[01:39:27.460 --> 01:39:29.880]   just as you would wait four hours or more
[01:39:29.880 --> 01:39:31.580]   to do your cold water immersion.
[01:39:31.580 --> 01:39:33.900]   Now there are nice data pointed to the fact
[01:39:33.900 --> 01:39:37.540]   that doing cold water immersion after a hard run,
[01:39:37.540 --> 01:39:41.660]   so endurance training, or even sprint and interval training,
[01:39:41.660 --> 01:39:45.660]   or after a weight workout where your main focus
[01:39:45.660 --> 01:39:47.500]   is on performance of those movements,
[01:39:47.500 --> 01:39:49.180]   or after a skill training workout
[01:39:49.180 --> 01:39:52.260]   where your main focus on performance of those movements,
[01:39:52.260 --> 01:39:54.200]   that there's no reason to think
[01:39:54.200 --> 01:39:57.380]   that that cold water immersion or ice bath or cold shower
[01:39:57.380 --> 01:40:01.540]   would inhibit the progress or the stimulus
[01:40:01.540 --> 01:40:03.820]   that would lead to progress that occurred
[01:40:03.820 --> 01:40:05.260]   during that training session.
[01:40:05.260 --> 01:40:07.460]   In other words, I don't see any reason
[01:40:07.460 --> 01:40:10.580]   based on the literature to avoid deliberate cold exposure
[01:40:10.580 --> 01:40:12.060]   immediately after training,
[01:40:12.060 --> 01:40:15.900]   again, unless your goal is hypertrophy and strength.
[01:40:15.900 --> 01:40:17.340]   And in fact, there's a very nice review
[01:40:17.340 --> 01:40:21.580]   that was recently published on deliberate cold exposure
[01:40:21.580 --> 01:40:24.720]   and how it can impact physical performance,
[01:40:24.720 --> 01:40:27.740]   whether or not it's done before or after
[01:40:27.740 --> 01:40:30.260]   different types of training and so forth.
[01:40:30.260 --> 01:40:33.520]   The paper is entitled, "Impact of Cold Water Immersion
[01:40:33.520 --> 01:40:35.260]   Compared with Passive Recovery
[01:40:35.260 --> 01:40:37.780]   Following a Single Bout of Strenuous Exercise
[01:40:37.780 --> 01:40:41.280]   on Athletic Performance in Physically Active Participants,
[01:40:41.280 --> 01:40:45.080]   a Systematic Review with Meta-analysis and Meta-regression."
[01:40:45.080 --> 01:40:49.540]   So this is a meta-analysis of 52 studies
[01:40:49.540 --> 01:40:51.900]   that looked at a tremendous number of variables
[01:40:51.900 --> 01:40:54.300]   and contexts as you would expect
[01:40:54.300 --> 01:40:56.820]   in a meta-analysis of 52 studies.
[01:40:56.820 --> 01:40:58.640]   I'm going to read you the conclusions of the study
[01:40:58.640 --> 01:40:59.880]   and I will provide a link.
[01:40:59.880 --> 01:41:00.900]   We certainly don't have the time
[01:41:00.900 --> 01:41:02.700]   to go through all the details of the study.
[01:41:02.700 --> 01:41:05.120]   I will highlight a few specific outcomes
[01:41:05.120 --> 01:41:07.060]   that I found particularly interesting,
[01:41:07.060 --> 01:41:10.400]   but here I am paraphrasing their conclusions
[01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:13.420]   that cold water immersion,
[01:41:13.420 --> 01:41:16.440]   I want to emphasize immersion, not cold showers,
[01:41:16.440 --> 01:41:18.080]   but cold water immersion,
[01:41:18.080 --> 01:41:20.040]   they say was an effective recovery tool
[01:41:20.040 --> 01:41:22.300]   after high intensity exercise.
[01:41:22.300 --> 01:41:23.860]   They observed positive outcomes,
[01:41:23.860 --> 01:41:27.360]   meaning improvements in certain variables
[01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:30.260]   for muscular power, muscular soreness,
[01:41:30.260 --> 01:41:33.280]   meaning reduced muscular soreness, increased muscular power,
[01:41:33.280 --> 01:41:36.720]   perceived recovery after 24 hours of exercise.
[01:41:36.720 --> 01:41:39.340]   However, there were certain forms of exercise
[01:41:39.340 --> 01:41:43.320]   that were not benefited by cold water immersion,
[01:41:43.320 --> 01:41:45.800]   such as eccentric exercise,
[01:41:45.800 --> 01:41:49.220]   exercise focusing only on the lowering component
[01:41:49.220 --> 01:41:52.700]   or the so-called eccentric component of resistance exercise.
[01:41:52.700 --> 01:41:56.620]   They saw some very interesting dose-response relationships
[01:41:56.620 --> 01:41:58.400]   for things like endurance training,
[01:41:58.400 --> 01:42:01.720]   meaning the longer the cold exposure
[01:42:01.720 --> 01:42:02.780]   post-endurance training,
[01:42:02.780 --> 01:42:05.300]   the more improvement in endurance performance,
[01:42:05.300 --> 01:42:08.740]   reductions in circulating creatine kinases
[01:42:08.740 --> 01:42:11.260]   and things that relate to muscle damage
[01:42:11.260 --> 01:42:13.080]   under certain conditions.
[01:42:13.080 --> 01:42:14.240]   At some point in the future, by the way,
[01:42:14.240 --> 01:42:17.220]   we'll do an entire episode on creatine and creatine kinases,
[01:42:17.220 --> 01:42:19.700]   which are important not just for muscular function,
[01:42:19.700 --> 01:42:21.580]   but also for brain function.
[01:42:21.580 --> 01:42:25.280]   But the basic takeaway was that cold water immersion
[01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:27.700]   performed after high-intensity exercise
[01:42:27.700 --> 01:42:30.740]   was beneficial from a number of different standpoints
[01:42:30.740 --> 01:42:35.740]   and indicated that shorter duration cold exposure
[01:42:35.740 --> 01:42:38.500]   and lower temperatures can improve
[01:42:38.500 --> 01:42:40.540]   the efficacy of cold water exposure
[01:42:40.540 --> 01:42:42.940]   if used after high-intensity exercise, okay?
[01:42:42.940 --> 01:42:45.400]   There I'm directly pulling from their conclusions.
[01:42:45.400 --> 01:42:47.860]   So what this says is that it's not just those
[01:42:47.860 --> 01:42:52.420]   longer duration 30, 45-minute and 60-minute protocols
[01:42:52.420 --> 01:42:54.860]   of cold water immersion that we discussed earlier,
[01:42:54.860 --> 01:42:58.100]   but also shorter duration, one-minute, three-minute,
[01:42:58.100 --> 01:43:02.460]   five-minute exposures to lower temperatures,
[01:43:02.460 --> 01:43:04.760]   temperatures that would make you psychologically
[01:43:04.760 --> 01:43:07.700]   want to get out as soon as you possibly can,
[01:43:07.700 --> 01:43:09.980]   but again, that you can safely stay in,
[01:43:09.980 --> 01:43:12.640]   done after training really have been shown
[01:43:12.640 --> 01:43:15.940]   to improve outcomes in terms of reducing soreness
[01:43:15.940 --> 01:43:18.700]   and improving training efficacy,
[01:43:18.700 --> 01:43:22.440]   meaning your ability to get back into training more quickly
[01:43:22.440 --> 01:43:25.700]   and thereby deliver more training stimuli
[01:43:25.700 --> 01:43:29.060]   to a given muscle or in your endurance training protocol.
[01:43:29.060 --> 01:43:29.900]   Translating to English,
[01:43:29.900 --> 01:43:32.100]   what this means is that taking a cold shower
[01:43:32.100 --> 01:43:33.620]   or getting into an ice bath
[01:43:33.620 --> 01:43:35.760]   or some other form of cold water immersion
[01:43:35.760 --> 01:43:37.100]   within the immediate minutes
[01:43:37.100 --> 01:43:40.300]   or even the immediate hours following your training
[01:43:40.300 --> 01:43:41.900]   has been shown to be beneficial.
[01:43:41.900 --> 01:43:45.820]   I'm sure a number of you have questions, for instance,
[01:43:45.820 --> 01:43:49.020]   how long should you be in that cold exposure?
[01:43:49.020 --> 01:43:52.720]   Is it the same as the 11-minute threshold described earlier?
[01:43:52.720 --> 01:43:53.640]   To be honest with you,
[01:43:53.640 --> 01:43:55.720]   there are not enough studies
[01:43:55.720 --> 01:43:58.180]   to really point to the critical threshold
[01:43:58.180 --> 01:44:01.800]   for eliminating or reducing delayed onset muscle soreness
[01:44:01.800 --> 01:44:04.480]   or for getting maximal results
[01:44:04.480 --> 01:44:06.560]   from power and endurance training,
[01:44:06.560 --> 01:44:09.200]   but this study does make a couple of key points,
[01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:11.180]   and here I will just paraphrase.
[01:44:11.180 --> 01:44:13.620]   For instance, that cold water immersion
[01:44:13.620 --> 01:44:16.860]   is more likely to positively influence
[01:44:16.860 --> 01:44:18.660]   muscular power performance,
[01:44:18.660 --> 01:44:20.340]   to reduce muscle soreness,
[01:44:20.340 --> 01:44:22.700]   to reduce serum creatine kinase,
[01:44:22.700 --> 01:44:24.920]   and to improve perceived recovery
[01:44:24.920 --> 01:44:26.780]   after high-intensity exercise
[01:44:26.780 --> 01:44:29.260]   as compared with passive recovery.
[01:44:29.260 --> 01:44:32.260]   This can be translated to cold water exposure
[01:44:32.260 --> 01:44:34.000]   after training is beneficial
[01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.880]   and probably better than passive recovery
[01:44:36.880 --> 01:44:38.640]   from a number of standpoints.
[01:44:38.640 --> 01:44:42.040]   In addition, they say that dose-response relationships,
[01:44:42.040 --> 01:44:47.100]   meaning the amount and the degree of cold
[01:44:47.100 --> 01:44:48.580]   that people were exposed to,
[01:44:48.580 --> 01:44:49.980]   and how often they did that,
[01:44:49.980 --> 01:44:53.740]   in particular in lower temperature cold immersion,
[01:44:53.740 --> 01:44:57.020]   so these would be the sorts of cold immersion protocols
[01:44:57.020 --> 01:44:59.040]   that are one minute or two minutes,
[01:44:59.040 --> 01:45:00.820]   three minutes, maybe five minutes,
[01:45:00.820 --> 01:45:02.780]   but that one couldn't stay in there longer
[01:45:02.780 --> 01:45:05.580]   because it feels stressful and one wants to get out,
[01:45:05.580 --> 01:45:08.260]   may be more effective after high-intensity exercise
[01:45:08.260 --> 01:45:11.380]   for removal of serum creatine kinase.
[01:45:11.380 --> 01:45:13.420]   As well, that these shorter duration
[01:45:13.420 --> 01:45:15.180]   cold water immersion approaches
[01:45:15.180 --> 01:45:16.100]   may be more effective
[01:45:16.100 --> 01:45:19.820]   after high-intensity endurance performance as well.
[01:45:19.820 --> 01:45:22.260]   So all of this can be translated to say
[01:45:22.260 --> 01:45:27.140]   that unless your main goal is hypertrophy and strength,
[01:45:27.140 --> 01:45:31.060]   that cold exposure, ideally cold immersion
[01:45:31.060 --> 01:45:32.540]   in cold water or ice bath,
[01:45:32.540 --> 01:45:34.220]   but if you don't have access to that,
[01:45:34.220 --> 01:45:37.180]   then cold showers is likely going to be beneficial
[01:45:37.180 --> 01:45:39.100]   if done immediately after
[01:45:39.100 --> 01:45:42.460]   or in the minutes or hours after your training,
[01:45:42.460 --> 01:45:44.260]   especially high-intensity training.
[01:45:44.260 --> 01:45:46.540]   One particularly nice thing about this meta-analysis
[01:45:46.540 --> 01:45:48.180]   is that it included some studies
[01:45:48.180 --> 01:45:50.740]   that involved the use of cooling packs,
[01:45:50.740 --> 01:45:55.400]   so again, vests that can hold essentially ice packs,
[01:45:55.400 --> 01:45:59.000]   and indeed even cryotherapy chambers and so on.
[01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:00.340]   There's a nice table in the study
[01:46:00.340 --> 01:46:01.860]   if you want to get really detailed
[01:46:01.860 --> 01:46:03.780]   and go and look specifically at those studies,
[01:46:03.780 --> 01:46:04.800]   I invite you to do that.
[01:46:04.800 --> 01:46:06.460]   We'll put a link to this study
[01:46:06.460 --> 01:46:08.600]   in the caption for this episode.
[01:46:08.600 --> 01:46:10.820]   But all in all, what this study shows is that
[01:46:10.820 --> 01:46:14.100]   deliberate cold exposure can be very useful
[01:46:14.100 --> 01:46:18.140]   for recovery, likely through reductions in inflammation
[01:46:18.140 --> 01:46:20.660]   in muscle and connective tissue.
[01:46:20.660 --> 01:46:22.900]   And while this study did not look specifically
[01:46:22.900 --> 01:46:24.900]   at the mechanisms of reduced inflammation
[01:46:24.900 --> 01:46:27.860]   caused by deliberate cold exposure,
[01:46:27.860 --> 01:46:30.460]   those mechanisms are somewhat known.
[01:46:30.460 --> 01:46:32.660]   There are a number of studies that have pointed to the fact
[01:46:32.660 --> 01:46:34.840]   that deliberate cold and cold generally
[01:46:34.840 --> 01:46:37.360]   can reduce inflammatory cytokines,
[01:46:37.360 --> 01:46:39.520]   such as IL-6, interleukin-6.
[01:46:39.520 --> 01:46:43.120]   It can increase anti-inflammatory cytokines,
[01:46:43.120 --> 01:46:45.260]   such as interleukin-10 and so on.
[01:46:45.260 --> 01:46:48.000]   Without getting into all those details,
[01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.560]   I think it's sufficient to say that
[01:46:50.560 --> 01:46:52.140]   if you are somebody who experiences
[01:46:52.140 --> 01:46:54.240]   a lot of delayed onset muscle soreness,
[01:46:54.240 --> 01:46:56.020]   taking a cold shower after your training
[01:46:56.020 --> 01:46:58.340]   or getting into a cold immersion after your training,
[01:46:58.340 --> 01:47:01.020]   even if it's a few hours later, ought to help.
[01:47:01.020 --> 01:47:04.560]   And if you are doing particularly intense training,
[01:47:04.560 --> 01:47:06.660]   then you probably want to ratchet up
[01:47:06.660 --> 01:47:10.180]   the number of cold exposure sessions that you're doing,
[01:47:10.180 --> 01:47:11.460]   even if those have to be done
[01:47:11.460 --> 01:47:12.980]   on separate days from your training,
[01:47:12.980 --> 01:47:15.900]   because a lot of the inflammatory effects of training,
[01:47:15.900 --> 01:47:16.940]   endurance and strength training,
[01:47:16.940 --> 01:47:19.040]   are actually occurring some hours
[01:47:19.040 --> 01:47:20.720]   away from the training stimulus.
[01:47:20.720 --> 01:47:22.020]   So it's not just that inflammation
[01:47:22.020 --> 01:47:25.100]   goes up radically during training, which it often can,
[01:47:25.100 --> 01:47:27.260]   but that it can occur even in the days
[01:47:27.260 --> 01:47:29.580]   and even weeks afterwards, depending on how intense
[01:47:29.580 --> 01:47:31.340]   and how long duration that training is.
[01:47:31.340 --> 01:47:33.860]   So deliberate cold exposure is very powerful
[01:47:33.860 --> 01:47:36.440]   as an anti-inflammatory tool.
[01:47:36.440 --> 01:47:38.580]   Now I'd like to emphasize a topic that we touched on
[01:47:38.580 --> 01:47:40.420]   at the beginning of the episode,
[01:47:40.420 --> 01:47:43.100]   which are those glabrous skin surfaces,
[01:47:43.100 --> 01:47:45.780]   the hands, the upper face, and the bottoms of the feet,
[01:47:45.780 --> 01:47:50.420]   through which heat is especially good at leaving the body.
[01:47:50.420 --> 01:47:52.700]   And another way of putting that
[01:47:52.700 --> 01:47:56.580]   is that one can cool the body much more efficiently
[01:47:56.580 --> 01:47:58.860]   through the glabrous skin surfaces.
[01:47:58.860 --> 01:48:00.580]   Now, if you want to understand
[01:48:00.580 --> 01:48:02.620]   all of the science behind this
[01:48:02.620 --> 01:48:05.860]   and all of the various applications,
[01:48:05.860 --> 01:48:07.780]   I invite you to please listen to the episode
[01:48:07.780 --> 01:48:09.860]   that I did with Dr. Craig Heller,
[01:48:09.860 --> 01:48:12.220]   again, in the biology department at Stanford.
[01:48:12.220 --> 01:48:14.720]   For sake of this episode,
[01:48:14.720 --> 01:48:17.060]   I'm just going to detail a couple of findings
[01:48:17.060 --> 01:48:18.360]   from his laboratory.
[01:48:18.360 --> 01:48:21.380]   The first one dealing with exercise-induced hyperthermia,
[01:48:21.380 --> 01:48:22.780]   because I think this is very interesting
[01:48:22.780 --> 01:48:24.580]   and it can even save lives
[01:48:24.580 --> 01:48:26.420]   if you understand the way this works.
[01:48:26.420 --> 01:48:30.420]   There's a particular paper that focuses on this
[01:48:30.420 --> 01:48:32.300]   and we will put a link to this as well.
[01:48:32.300 --> 01:48:34.160]   The title of this paper is "Novel Application
[01:48:34.160 --> 01:48:35.540]   of Chemical Cold Packs for Treatment
[01:48:35.540 --> 01:48:37.460]   of Exercise-Induced Hyperthermia,
[01:48:37.460 --> 01:48:39.540]   a Randomized Control Trial."
[01:48:39.540 --> 01:48:42.160]   This is a pretty brutal study,
[01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:44.820]   brutal for the subjects, that is.
[01:48:44.820 --> 01:48:47.940]   What this study involved was having subjects
[01:48:47.940 --> 01:48:50.960]   walk on a treadmill at a pretty significant incline,
[01:48:50.960 --> 01:48:53.660]   anywhere from 9% to 17%,
[01:48:53.660 --> 01:48:56.260]   wearing a substantial amount of clothing
[01:48:56.260 --> 01:48:58.220]   that was not well ventilated,
[01:48:58.220 --> 01:49:00.700]   and the room was kept to 40 degrees Celsius,
[01:49:00.700 --> 01:49:03.180]   which is 104 degrees Fahrenheit.
[01:49:03.180 --> 01:49:06.680]   This is definitely not something to do at home.
[01:49:06.680 --> 01:49:09.180]   This study was designed to induce hyperthermia,
[01:49:09.180 --> 01:49:11.580]   which, as I mentioned earlier, can be quite dangerous.
[01:49:11.580 --> 01:49:14.500]   And they compared two types of cooling.
[01:49:14.500 --> 01:49:16.180]   In the first form of cooling
[01:49:16.180 --> 01:49:18.200]   that they call traditional cooling,
[01:49:18.200 --> 01:49:21.500]   they had ice packs on their neck,
[01:49:21.500 --> 01:49:23.880]   in their armpits, and in their groin.
[01:49:23.880 --> 01:49:25.500]   And in the other group,
[01:49:25.500 --> 01:49:27.840]   there was the so-called glabrous skin cooling.
[01:49:27.840 --> 01:49:29.580]   So the palms, the soles of the feet,
[01:49:29.580 --> 01:49:30.900]   which were actually,
[01:49:30.900 --> 01:49:35.440]   so they were cooling inside the boots or inside of gloves,
[01:49:35.440 --> 01:49:38.160]   and on the upper portion of the face.
[01:49:39.040 --> 01:49:41.220]   And the basic takeaway of this study
[01:49:41.220 --> 01:49:43.240]   is that by cooling the glabrous skin,
[01:49:43.240 --> 01:49:47.260]   the subjects were able to sustain this walking
[01:49:47.260 --> 01:49:50.880]   on these incline treadmills for much longer
[01:49:50.880 --> 01:49:54.180]   than were the people who received traditional cooling.
[01:49:54.180 --> 01:49:56.380]   And also, the return to baseline temperature
[01:49:56.380 --> 01:49:59.820]   was much faster in the glabrous skin cooling group.
[01:49:59.820 --> 01:50:01.840]   So how this translates to the real world
[01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:04.040]   is that if ever you are hyperthermic,
[01:50:04.040 --> 01:50:05.640]   or someone else is hyperthermic,
[01:50:05.640 --> 01:50:08.880]   one way to cool them down quickly
[01:50:08.880 --> 01:50:13.260]   is to cool these palmar glabrous,
[01:50:13.260 --> 01:50:14.500]   soles of the feet glabrous,
[01:50:14.500 --> 01:50:18.020]   and upper portion of the face glabrous portions of the body
[01:50:18.020 --> 01:50:21.080]   using cool rags, using ice packs,
[01:50:21.080 --> 01:50:24.680]   or using any number of different cold objects
[01:50:24.680 --> 01:50:25.520]   or temperatures.
[01:50:25.520 --> 01:50:30.100]   One key thing if you're going to use glabrous skin cooling
[01:50:30.100 --> 01:50:33.140]   is that whatever you use to cool those surfaces
[01:50:33.140 --> 01:50:37.060]   cannot be so cold that it causes vasoconstriction.
[01:50:37.060 --> 01:50:38.920]   Because as I mentioned earlier,
[01:50:38.920 --> 01:50:41.660]   the arteriovenous ostomoses,
[01:50:41.660 --> 01:50:43.920]   these portals of arteries directly to veins
[01:50:43.920 --> 01:50:47.780]   that exist only in these glabrous skin surfaces,
[01:50:47.780 --> 01:50:51.580]   the way that they're able to cool the body
[01:50:51.580 --> 01:50:53.900]   and essentially pass cool into the body,
[01:50:53.900 --> 01:50:55.080]   although that's not really what they're doing,
[01:50:55.080 --> 01:50:57.420]   they're actually extracting heat from the body
[01:50:57.420 --> 01:51:00.520]   to be technical, they're extracting heat from the body,
[01:51:00.520 --> 01:51:02.500]   the only way they can do that
[01:51:02.500 --> 01:51:05.100]   is if those veins don't collapse
[01:51:05.100 --> 01:51:08.780]   and veins will collapse if they are made very, very cold.
[01:51:08.780 --> 01:51:11.540]   So if you want to use glabrous skin cooling
[01:51:11.540 --> 01:51:14.420]   to offset hyperthermia or for the other forms of performance
[01:51:14.420 --> 01:51:16.180]   which we will talk about in a moment,
[01:51:16.180 --> 01:51:19.660]   you need to use a cool object or surface
[01:51:19.660 --> 01:51:22.260]   that is not so cold that it causes vasoconstriction.
[01:51:22.260 --> 01:51:24.700]   And this can be a little bit tough to dial in,
[01:51:24.700 --> 01:51:27.940]   meaning it can be tough to identify such an object.
[01:51:27.940 --> 01:51:30.340]   And for that reason, Dr. Heller and some of his colleagues
[01:51:30.340 --> 01:51:32.480]   have developed a commercial product called the CoolMitt,
[01:51:32.480 --> 01:51:34.580]   you can actually go to their website, coolmitt.com,
[01:51:34.580 --> 01:51:37.820]   I don't have any financial or other relationship to them.
[01:51:37.820 --> 01:51:39.540]   I know they've been developing this technology
[01:51:39.540 --> 01:51:40.460]   for some period of time,
[01:51:40.460 --> 01:51:43.580]   it involves a glove that you put your hand into,
[01:51:43.580 --> 01:51:46.700]   it circulates water of a given temperature
[01:51:46.700 --> 01:51:49.340]   and it does so at a temperature
[01:51:49.340 --> 01:51:53.140]   that is sure to not cause vasoconstriction of the palm.
[01:51:53.140 --> 01:51:53.980]   And you might be asking,
[01:51:53.980 --> 01:51:56.220]   how can you just put your hand into one glove
[01:51:56.220 --> 01:51:57.040]   and have this work?
[01:51:57.040 --> 01:51:59.780]   Well, that's how powerful these glabrous skin surfaces are,
[01:51:59.780 --> 01:52:02.840]   even just by cooling one palm,
[01:52:02.840 --> 01:52:06.300]   the core body temperature drops radically.
[01:52:06.300 --> 01:52:08.900]   Now that's their commercial technology.
[01:52:08.900 --> 01:52:10.660]   I know that some people out there have started
[01:52:10.660 --> 01:52:13.060]   to experiment with a home version of this,
[01:52:13.060 --> 01:52:15.580]   which would be taking a package, for instance,
[01:52:15.580 --> 01:52:18.920]   of frozen blueberries or some other cold drink
[01:52:18.920 --> 01:52:21.760]   or cold metal object and actually bringing it into the gym
[01:52:21.760 --> 01:52:23.380]   or out on a run.
[01:52:23.380 --> 01:52:25.080]   There are even people who are now developing
[01:52:25.080 --> 01:52:29.200]   cooled bicycle handles for long rides.
[01:52:29.200 --> 01:52:31.280]   This might seem a little kooky or crazy to you,
[01:52:31.280 --> 01:52:35.000]   but as you'll soon hear in the study I'm about to describe,
[01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:38.760]   the increases in endurance and in the volume
[01:52:38.760 --> 01:52:41.700]   of strength training that people can conduct
[01:52:41.700 --> 01:52:43.740]   if they appropriately cool their body
[01:52:43.740 --> 01:52:46.140]   through these glabrous skin portals
[01:52:46.140 --> 01:52:48.360]   is actually quite significant.
[01:52:48.360 --> 01:52:50.500]   So again, as it relates to hyperthermia,
[01:52:50.500 --> 01:52:52.220]   if someone is overheating,
[01:52:52.220 --> 01:52:54.220]   by all means try and get them out of that heat,
[01:52:54.220 --> 01:52:55.700]   get them to stop exercising.
[01:52:55.700 --> 01:52:57.600]   You can die from hyperthermia,
[01:52:57.600 --> 01:52:59.040]   try and cool the bottoms of the feet,
[01:52:59.040 --> 01:53:01.280]   the palms of their hands
[01:53:01.280 --> 01:53:03.200]   and the upper portion of their face.
[01:53:03.200 --> 01:53:06.420]   That does not mean that it would be a bad idea
[01:53:06.420 --> 01:53:08.160]   to put cold water on the top of their head.
[01:53:08.160 --> 01:53:10.640]   That probably would also help and perhaps on their neck.
[01:53:10.640 --> 01:53:13.400]   What is probably not going to be a good idea
[01:53:13.400 --> 01:53:15.720]   is to do the more standard thing
[01:53:15.720 --> 01:53:17.300]   of draping someone in cold towels
[01:53:17.300 --> 01:53:18.360]   on the surface of their body.
[01:53:18.360 --> 01:53:20.460]   Because as I mentioned at the beginning of the episode,
[01:53:20.460 --> 01:53:22.360]   that thermostat in the hypothalamus,
[01:53:22.360 --> 01:53:25.660]   the medial preoptic area will typically react to that
[01:53:25.660 --> 01:53:28.240]   by increasing core body temperature further.
[01:53:28.240 --> 01:53:31.540]   The effects of glabrous skin cooling on physical performance
[01:53:31.540 --> 01:53:34.200]   are truly remarkable provided the glabrous skin cooling
[01:53:34.200 --> 01:53:36.360]   is done correctly.
[01:53:36.360 --> 01:53:39.960]   And I want to point out that the main degree of effect
[01:53:39.960 --> 01:53:44.160]   is on volume or the ability to do more work.
[01:53:44.160 --> 01:53:45.400]   And I want to point this out
[01:53:45.400 --> 01:53:47.640]   because I think that many people,
[01:53:47.640 --> 01:53:49.320]   certainly in the exercise science community,
[01:53:49.320 --> 01:53:50.520]   but even in the general public,
[01:53:50.520 --> 01:53:52.420]   when they hear about some of these effects
[01:53:52.420 --> 01:53:54.600]   that are measured in the laboratory,
[01:53:54.600 --> 01:53:59.080]   they sort of look at those effects a bit askance
[01:53:59.080 --> 01:54:01.040]   and they think, well, that's not possible, right?
[01:54:01.040 --> 01:54:03.400]   Effects, for instance, that have been documented
[01:54:03.400 --> 01:54:05.860]   showing doubling or tripling of the number of dips
[01:54:05.860 --> 01:54:08.760]   that one can do in a relatively short amount of time,
[01:54:08.760 --> 01:54:11.760]   or doubling of the number of pull-ups one can do,
[01:54:11.760 --> 01:54:13.920]   or 14% increases in strength,
[01:54:13.920 --> 01:54:16.480]   or even comparable degrees in increase
[01:54:16.480 --> 01:54:18.280]   in weight training output
[01:54:18.280 --> 01:54:20.400]   to people who are on performance enhancing drugs,
[01:54:20.400 --> 01:54:22.200]   et cetera, et cetera.
[01:54:22.200 --> 01:54:25.000]   Part of the confusion is that the effects
[01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.380]   of proper Palmer cooling,
[01:54:27.380 --> 01:54:30.080]   because it almost always is done by Palmer cooling
[01:54:30.080 --> 01:54:32.400]   and less often in these experiments
[01:54:32.400 --> 01:54:34.060]   by cooling of the bottoms of the feet
[01:54:34.060 --> 01:54:35.520]   in the upper portion of the face,
[01:54:35.520 --> 01:54:39.840]   but those effects tend to be the ability
[01:54:39.840 --> 01:54:42.880]   to do more work over time.
[01:54:42.880 --> 01:54:45.160]   And just to illustrate some of the major effects
[01:54:45.160 --> 01:54:46.320]   that the Heller lab has seen
[01:54:46.320 --> 01:54:48.080]   and that are documented in this manuscript
[01:54:48.080 --> 01:54:49.920]   that I'll share with you in a moment,
[01:54:50.960 --> 01:54:53.320]   the typical protocol is to have people come in
[01:54:53.320 --> 01:54:56.200]   and do some endurance training, so running on a treadmill,
[01:54:56.200 --> 01:54:59.440]   and to have a condition where one group
[01:54:59.440 --> 01:55:00.960]   is actually doing Palmer cooling
[01:55:00.960 --> 01:55:03.600]   while they are on a bike or on a treadmill.
[01:55:03.600 --> 01:55:06.960]   And inevitably the outcome is that they can do more work.
[01:55:06.960 --> 01:55:09.920]   They can pedal further at a given speed,
[01:55:09.920 --> 01:55:12.780]   or they can run longer at a given speed
[01:55:12.780 --> 01:55:14.800]   than people who are not doing Palmer cooling
[01:55:14.800 --> 01:55:18.780]   or who are receiving cooling by way of cold compress
[01:55:18.780 --> 01:55:22.760]   to the back of the neck or ice pack to the armpits, et cetera.
[01:55:22.760 --> 01:55:25.040]   So the effects of Palmer cooling are very clear
[01:55:25.040 --> 01:55:26.720]   and very robust.
[01:55:26.720 --> 01:55:29.560]   And in the context of endurance exercise,
[01:55:29.560 --> 01:55:31.920]   almost always allow people to do more work,
[01:55:31.920 --> 01:55:34.080]   to go longer with less perceived effort
[01:55:34.080 --> 01:55:36.140]   and to quit later, so to speak.
[01:55:36.140 --> 01:55:38.780]   In terms of strength training,
[01:55:38.780 --> 01:55:42.540]   they've looked at the capacity to perform sets of dips.
[01:55:42.540 --> 01:55:44.780]   So one of the more famous examples of this
[01:55:44.780 --> 01:55:48.760]   that Dr. Heller shares in the episode that we did earlier,
[01:55:48.760 --> 01:55:50.940]   and that you can find at Hubermanlab.com,
[01:55:50.940 --> 01:55:54.100]   involves someone coming in and doing sets of dips,
[01:55:54.100 --> 01:55:55.900]   maybe 40 dips.
[01:55:55.900 --> 01:55:58.320]   This person actually could do 40 dips on their first set,
[01:55:58.320 --> 01:56:00.620]   then resting for a period of two to three minutes
[01:56:00.620 --> 01:56:02.420]   and then doing 35,
[01:56:02.420 --> 01:56:04.500]   and then resting for a period of two or three minutes
[01:56:04.500 --> 01:56:06.820]   and then doing progressively fewer and fewer and fewer
[01:56:06.820 --> 01:56:09.380]   to the point where over a period of time,
[01:56:09.380 --> 01:56:11.820]   they add up the total number of dips that they can do,
[01:56:11.820 --> 01:56:14.220]   and then they have them come back
[01:56:14.220 --> 01:56:15.620]   after a period of recovery.
[01:56:15.620 --> 01:56:18.700]   So not immediately after, but take a couple of days,
[01:56:18.700 --> 01:56:21.540]   come back and do effectively the same protocol,
[01:56:21.540 --> 01:56:22.900]   but during their rest periods,
[01:56:22.900 --> 01:56:25.880]   they're doing two minutes of Palmer cooling,
[01:56:25.880 --> 01:56:29.300]   which essentially allows heat to move out of the body,
[01:56:29.300 --> 01:56:31.500]   lowering core body temperature, in other words.
[01:56:31.500 --> 01:56:35.320]   And what they find is that they see enormous increases
[01:56:35.320 --> 01:56:37.300]   in the total number of dips that people can do,
[01:56:37.300 --> 01:56:38.600]   but that doesn't mean that the person goes
[01:56:38.600 --> 01:56:39.860]   from being able to do 40 dips
[01:56:39.860 --> 01:56:43.080]   to being able to do 50 dips or 60 dips on that first set.
[01:56:43.080 --> 01:56:46.020]   What it means is they are able to do 40 on the first set,
[01:56:46.020 --> 01:56:48.880]   then 40 on the second, then 38 on the third,
[01:56:48.880 --> 01:56:50.040]   and so on and so forth,
[01:56:50.040 --> 01:56:52.900]   so that the total duration of the workout is extended,
[01:56:52.900 --> 01:56:55.500]   and yet they're doing much more work,
[01:56:55.500 --> 01:56:57.300]   even though it takes more time.
[01:56:57.300 --> 01:56:59.380]   So that's an important point,
[01:56:59.380 --> 01:57:02.820]   and I think a point that perhaps wasn't as clear
[01:57:02.820 --> 01:57:05.380]   or as clearly made by me in the previous episodes
[01:57:05.380 --> 01:57:07.420]   that discussed this topic.
[01:57:07.420 --> 01:57:08.700]   For those of you that are interested
[01:57:08.700 --> 01:57:10.940]   in exploring Palmer cooling,
[01:57:10.940 --> 01:57:13.780]   first of all, I recommend taking a brief glance
[01:57:13.780 --> 01:57:17.060]   or even a deep dive into this study,
[01:57:17.060 --> 01:57:18.560]   which is entitled work volume
[01:57:18.560 --> 01:57:21.180]   and strength training responses to resistive exercise
[01:57:21.180 --> 01:57:24.280]   improve with periodic heat extraction from the palm.
[01:57:24.280 --> 01:57:30.360]   In this study, they describe big increases in anaerobic,
[01:57:30.360 --> 01:57:32.620]   meaning strength training output,
[01:57:32.620 --> 01:57:36.960]   things like improvement in dips, improvement in bench press,
[01:57:36.960 --> 01:57:40.820]   improvement in pull-ups, et cetera, in human subjects.
[01:57:40.820 --> 01:57:42.380]   And it's a really nice study
[01:57:42.380 --> 01:57:43.940]   and points to some of the protocols
[01:57:43.940 --> 01:57:46.780]   that you might be able to adapt in your own setup.
[01:57:46.780 --> 01:57:48.900]   For instance, over six weeks of pull-up training,
[01:57:48.900 --> 01:57:53.900]   palm cooling in between sets, improved volume by 144%,
[01:57:53.900 --> 01:57:56.460]   and this was in experienced subjects.
[01:57:56.460 --> 01:57:58.860]   So that's interesting because a lot of studies
[01:57:58.860 --> 01:58:01.340]   of strength training and improvements in hypertrophy
[01:58:01.340 --> 01:58:04.580]   and strength are done in inexperienced untrained athletes,
[01:58:04.580 --> 01:58:07.340]   which changes the picture somewhat
[01:58:07.340 --> 01:58:10.640]   compared to experienced athletes.
[01:58:10.640 --> 01:58:13.440]   They found that strength, meaning the one repetition maximum
[01:58:13.440 --> 01:58:17.100]   increased 22% over 10 weeks in bench press training.
[01:58:17.100 --> 01:58:20.000]   And they point to the particularly strong effects
[01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:23.380]   of using Palmer cooling when people reach plateaus
[01:58:23.380 --> 01:58:25.080]   in endurance and strength training.
[01:58:25.080 --> 01:58:26.660]   And there, I think it's an important point.
[01:58:26.660 --> 01:58:30.260]   I think that if you're going to explore Palmer cooling,
[01:58:30.260 --> 01:58:31.860]   it's probably not the sort of thing
[01:58:31.860 --> 01:58:34.040]   that you're going to do in every run
[01:58:34.040 --> 01:58:35.980]   or in every bout of cycling
[01:58:35.980 --> 01:58:38.600]   or in every strength training session,
[01:58:38.600 --> 01:58:42.500]   but that it might be used to vastly increase your volume
[01:58:42.500 --> 01:58:45.700]   or vastly increase your endurance in a given session
[01:58:45.700 --> 01:58:49.060]   or a set of sessions in order to push through plateaus.
[01:58:49.060 --> 01:58:51.620]   A particularly interesting point in light of that
[01:58:51.620 --> 01:58:54.660]   is Dr. Heller has observed again and again
[01:58:54.660 --> 01:58:57.620]   that Palmer cooling reduces delayed onset muscle soreness
[01:58:57.620 --> 01:58:59.460]   or can eliminate it entirely.
[01:58:59.460 --> 01:59:01.560]   And that's very interesting because it also points
[01:59:01.560 --> 01:59:03.900]   to the fact that reducing core body temperature
[01:59:03.900 --> 01:59:06.160]   may somehow be involved in short circuiting
[01:59:06.160 --> 01:59:09.620]   the normal mechanisms of delayed onset muscle soreness.
[01:59:09.620 --> 01:59:12.340]   And you might say, well, how would temperature be involved
[01:59:12.340 --> 01:59:14.320]   in delayed onset muscle soreness?
[01:59:14.320 --> 01:59:17.540]   Well, I want to refer you back to the meta analysis
[01:59:17.540 --> 01:59:20.380]   that we talked about earlier where the short duration,
[01:59:20.380 --> 01:59:23.040]   very cold temperature exposure after training
[01:59:23.040 --> 01:59:25.480]   did indeed reduce delayed onset muscle soreness
[01:59:25.480 --> 01:59:28.940]   in part through reduction, excuse me, in creatine kinase.
[01:59:28.940 --> 01:59:32.280]   So it's not inconceivable that temperature
[01:59:32.280 --> 01:59:34.980]   and delayed onset muscle soreness are related.
[01:59:34.980 --> 01:59:37.160]   And that raises perhaps the most important point,
[01:59:37.160 --> 01:59:42.160]   which is the way that Palmer cooling can improve performance
[01:59:42.160 --> 01:59:46.080]   by way of reducing core body temperature is known.
[01:59:46.080 --> 01:59:50.360]   And that is because when one engages in exercise
[01:59:50.360 --> 01:59:52.060]   or muscular output of any kind,
[01:59:52.060 --> 01:59:54.880]   strength or endurance exercise,
[01:59:54.880 --> 01:59:58.380]   the range of temperatures under which a muscle can perform
[01:59:58.380 --> 02:00:00.560]   is actually very narrow.
[02:00:00.560 --> 02:00:02.760]   There's an enzyme called pyruvate kinase,
[02:00:02.760 --> 02:00:05.600]   which is critical to muscle contractions
[02:00:05.600 --> 02:00:07.900]   and pyruvate kinase can only function
[02:00:07.900 --> 02:00:09.780]   in a very narrow range of temperatures.
[02:00:09.780 --> 02:00:11.500]   If that temperature gets too hot,
[02:00:11.500 --> 02:00:13.880]   meaning if the muscle heats up locally,
[02:00:13.880 --> 02:00:16.240]   whether or not by running or cycling or swimming
[02:00:16.240 --> 02:00:19.240]   or weightlifting, the ability for that muscle
[02:00:19.240 --> 02:00:21.500]   to continue to contract is reduced
[02:00:21.500 --> 02:00:23.880]   and eventually is short-circuited completely.
[02:00:23.880 --> 02:00:26.760]   And I think this is a much underexplored
[02:00:26.760 --> 02:00:29.380]   or at least a much under-discussed aspect
[02:00:29.380 --> 02:00:31.000]   of so-called muscular failure
[02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:35.280]   or the failure of one to continue to endure in running.
[02:00:35.280 --> 02:00:36.680]   So for instance, when you run
[02:00:36.680 --> 02:00:38.720]   as compared to a bench press or something,
[02:00:38.720 --> 02:00:39.920]   you don't stop running
[02:00:39.920 --> 02:00:42.400]   because you can't actually contract the muscles further,
[02:00:42.400 --> 02:00:46.000]   but somehow signals about the heating up
[02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.700]   of muscular tissue are conveyed to the brain.
[02:00:48.700 --> 02:00:49.720]   There's a crosstalk there.
[02:00:49.720 --> 02:00:52.360]   It's probably bi-directional and people stop.
[02:00:52.360 --> 02:00:53.320]   They quit, right?
[02:00:53.320 --> 02:00:54.840]   This is the quitting reflex.
[02:00:54.840 --> 02:00:58.160]   In strength training,
[02:00:58.160 --> 02:01:00.160]   one can no longer perform a repetition
[02:01:00.160 --> 02:01:01.720]   or set of repetitions in part
[02:01:01.720 --> 02:01:03.460]   because of heating up of the muscle locally.
[02:01:03.460 --> 02:01:05.540]   There are other mechanisms as well, of course,
[02:01:05.540 --> 02:01:06.980]   and I realize that.
[02:01:06.980 --> 02:01:09.620]   But what's very clear from the palmar cooling work
[02:01:09.620 --> 02:01:13.220]   is that by simply holding onto a cool object,
[02:01:13.220 --> 02:01:14.880]   remember, not an object so cold
[02:01:14.880 --> 02:01:17.080]   that it constricts the vessels of the palms
[02:01:17.080 --> 02:01:20.040]   or constricts the vessels on the bottoms of the feet,
[02:01:20.040 --> 02:01:22.760]   but by holding onto a relatively cool object
[02:01:22.760 --> 02:01:26.080]   in one or both hands in between sets for two minutes or so,
[02:01:26.080 --> 02:01:29.780]   you can very efficiently reduce your core body temperature.
[02:01:29.780 --> 02:01:31.160]   And in doing so,
[02:01:31.160 --> 02:01:32.880]   reduce the temperature of the muscles
[02:01:32.880 --> 02:01:34.080]   that are doing the work,
[02:01:34.080 --> 02:01:37.860]   increase the capacity for pyruvate kinase
[02:01:37.860 --> 02:01:40.760]   to continue to allow your muscles to contract
[02:01:40.760 --> 02:01:43.980]   and thereby allow you to do more volume of endurance
[02:01:43.980 --> 02:01:45.000]   and strength training.
[02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:48.180]   So a simple protocol that Dr. Heller passed to me
[02:01:48.180 --> 02:01:51.560]   is find a relatively cool object.
[02:01:51.560 --> 02:01:54.360]   So you could, for instance, fill two bottles with cold water,
[02:01:54.360 --> 02:01:56.440]   maybe put a few ice cubes in there, right?
[02:01:56.440 --> 02:01:58.400]   This is not exact because we're not talking
[02:01:58.400 --> 02:02:00.020]   about the commercial cool mint product here,
[02:02:00.020 --> 02:02:01.780]   we're talking about an at-home version,
[02:02:01.780 --> 02:02:05.280]   or use a pack of frozen blueberries or broccoli,
[02:02:05.280 --> 02:02:07.800]   the sort of pack of those as what he described,
[02:02:07.800 --> 02:02:10.380]   and then in between sets to put your hands,
[02:02:10.380 --> 02:02:12.080]   and ideally you'd put the bottoms of your feet,
[02:02:12.080 --> 02:02:13.880]   but that's not always feasible in most gyms
[02:02:13.880 --> 02:02:16.180]   where they won't let you take off your shoes and so forth,
[02:02:16.180 --> 02:02:19.120]   but to put the palms of your hands on that cool surface
[02:02:19.120 --> 02:02:22.540]   for a minute or two minutes between sets
[02:02:22.540 --> 02:02:24.880]   and then returning to your sets of work.
[02:02:24.880 --> 02:02:28.600]   Now, if you are heating up through other mechanisms,
[02:02:28.600 --> 02:02:29.900]   like you're wearing a stocking cap
[02:02:29.900 --> 02:02:31.500]   and you're in a very warm environment,
[02:02:31.500 --> 02:02:33.380]   this might not have as potent an effect
[02:02:33.380 --> 02:02:35.080]   as if you were to do this cooling
[02:02:35.080 --> 02:02:36.740]   in a more moderate environment
[02:02:36.740 --> 02:02:38.640]   wearing lighter clothing, et cetera.
[02:02:38.640 --> 02:02:41.480]   So by all means, warm up to do your exercise,
[02:02:41.480 --> 02:02:43.240]   lubricate your joints and get into a place
[02:02:43.240 --> 02:02:44.320]   where you're not going to injure yourself
[02:02:44.320 --> 02:02:46.400]   doing whatever form of exercise you do,
[02:02:46.400 --> 02:02:48.920]   but then if you'd like to explore Palmer cooling,
[02:02:48.920 --> 02:02:51.120]   I know a number of people who've written to me saying
[02:02:51.120 --> 02:02:52.220]   they heard about Palmer cooling
[02:02:52.220 --> 02:02:53.460]   on the episode with Dr. Heller,
[02:02:53.460 --> 02:02:56.620]   they've tried this and they see quite excellent results.
[02:02:56.620 --> 02:02:58.200]   It does take some discipline, right?
[02:02:58.200 --> 02:02:59.940]   It's one thing to just kind of hang out in the gym
[02:02:59.940 --> 02:03:01.240]   and play on your phone in between sets.
[02:03:01.240 --> 02:03:04.100]   It's another to do deliberate cooling with your palms
[02:03:04.100 --> 02:03:04.940]   or the bottom of your feet
[02:03:04.940 --> 02:03:06.520]   or the upper portion of your face.
[02:03:06.520 --> 02:03:07.880]   You might get some weird looks,
[02:03:07.880 --> 02:03:09.060]   but of course you'll be the one
[02:03:09.060 --> 02:03:11.040]   doing significantly more volume,
[02:03:11.040 --> 02:03:13.500]   not experiencing delayed onset muscle soreness
[02:03:13.500 --> 02:03:16.000]   and achieving better endurance and strength gains
[02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:17.500]   were you to do this properly.
[02:03:17.500 --> 02:03:19.380]   Now, as a final topic related
[02:03:19.380 --> 02:03:21.400]   to the use of deliberate cold exposure
[02:03:21.400 --> 02:03:23.740]   for improving health and performance,
[02:03:23.740 --> 02:03:27.520]   I'd like to touch on this theme that exists online
[02:03:27.520 --> 02:03:29.000]   on social media, on YouTube,
[02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.760]   and in various fitness communities
[02:03:31.760 --> 02:03:34.280]   of using deliberate cold exposure to the groin,
[02:03:34.280 --> 02:03:36.300]   in particular to the testicles,
[02:03:36.300 --> 02:03:39.260]   in order to try and increase testosterone.
[02:03:39.260 --> 02:03:41.620]   And while this might sound really kooky,
[02:03:41.620 --> 02:03:44.360]   indeed this practice exists.
[02:03:44.360 --> 02:03:47.100]   Indeed, if you were to go on the Amazon,
[02:03:47.100 --> 02:03:50.360]   there are actually ice pack underwear
[02:03:50.360 --> 02:03:52.560]   that are being marketed
[02:03:52.560 --> 02:03:54.800]   for sake of increasing testosterone.
[02:03:54.800 --> 02:03:57.800]   Now, I am not aware of any specific well-controlled studies
[02:03:57.800 --> 02:04:00.400]   that show that this indeed works.
[02:04:00.400 --> 02:04:03.720]   I can imagine based on what I know about the nervous system,
[02:04:03.720 --> 02:04:06.000]   testosterone and cold, et cetera,
[02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:07.340]   that there are a couple of mechanisms
[02:04:07.340 --> 02:04:11.000]   by which one might experience increases in testosterone
[02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.120]   as a consequence of deliberate cold exposure.
[02:04:13.120 --> 02:04:14.040]   First off, let me say,
[02:04:14.040 --> 02:04:17.960]   there is no reason why you would have to apply these ice packs
[02:04:17.960 --> 02:04:19.600]   in the way that I just described.
[02:04:20.360 --> 02:04:22.200]   One could, of course, take a cold shower.
[02:04:22.200 --> 02:04:26.280]   One could, of course, use cold immersion of various kinds,
[02:04:26.280 --> 02:04:29.720]   and you're still going to get that exposure of the groin
[02:04:29.720 --> 02:04:31.380]   and the testicles to cold.
[02:04:31.380 --> 02:04:34.680]   Now, I should point out that people do report,
[02:04:34.680 --> 02:04:38.460]   at least anecdotally, increases in testosterone
[02:04:38.460 --> 02:04:40.000]   as a consequence of this practice.
[02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:41.160]   And I have to imagine
[02:04:41.160 --> 02:04:43.040]   that they are measuring their serum testosterone,
[02:04:43.040 --> 02:04:44.040]   that they're not just guessing
[02:04:44.040 --> 02:04:46.420]   that their testosterone went up.
[02:04:46.420 --> 02:04:48.480]   If you know of a study exploring this directly,
[02:04:48.480 --> 02:04:49.720]   please let me know,
[02:04:49.720 --> 02:04:51.520]   put it in the comment section on YouTube,
[02:04:51.520 --> 02:04:53.160]   or even just email me.
[02:04:53.160 --> 02:04:57.400]   We have a email that you can find at hubermanlab.com.
[02:04:57.400 --> 02:04:58.880]   Please email me the reference.
[02:04:58.880 --> 02:05:00.600]   I wasn't able to find a reference,
[02:05:00.600 --> 02:05:04.220]   but I can imagine two reasonably plausible mechanisms
[02:05:04.220 --> 02:05:07.520]   by which deliberate cold exposure to the groin
[02:05:07.520 --> 02:05:10.720]   and particularly the testicles would increase testosterone.
[02:05:10.720 --> 02:05:13.240]   The first is somewhat direct,
[02:05:13.240 --> 02:05:17.080]   which is that anytime you cool a body surface,
[02:05:17.080 --> 02:05:18.480]   that if it's cold enough,
[02:05:18.480 --> 02:05:20.280]   you're going to get vasoconstriction.
[02:05:20.280 --> 02:05:21.280]   And then subsequently,
[02:05:21.280 --> 02:05:24.680]   you're going to get a rebound increase in vasodilation,
[02:05:24.680 --> 02:05:26.620]   meaning you're going to constrict the blood vessels
[02:05:26.620 --> 02:05:27.460]   in that area.
[02:05:27.460 --> 02:05:29.520]   And then after the cold is removed,
[02:05:29.520 --> 02:05:31.400]   there's going to be more blood flow to that area.
[02:05:31.400 --> 02:05:32.240]   And of course,
[02:05:32.240 --> 02:05:35.100]   blood flow relates to organ health and tissue health,
[02:05:35.100 --> 02:05:40.100]   generally, so perfusion of that region and the gonads,
[02:05:40.100 --> 02:05:42.880]   to be specific, with additional blood,
[02:05:42.880 --> 02:05:46.200]   you could imagine in some ways increasing testosterone.
[02:05:46.200 --> 02:05:48.300]   That's reasonably plausible.
[02:05:48.300 --> 02:05:51.020]   The other probably more likely mechanism
[02:05:51.020 --> 02:05:54.900]   relates to the dopamine increases caused by cold exposure
[02:05:54.900 --> 02:05:56.300]   that we talked about earlier.
[02:05:56.300 --> 02:05:59.640]   Again, anytime you have a somewhat stressful stimulus,
[02:05:59.640 --> 02:06:01.440]   but in particular with cold exposure,
[02:06:01.440 --> 02:06:04.480]   it seems that the catecholamines norepinephrine, epinephrine,
[02:06:04.480 --> 02:06:07.320]   and dopamine all increase.
[02:06:07.320 --> 02:06:10.800]   And dopamine is known to be in the pathway
[02:06:10.800 --> 02:06:13.060]   that can stimulate testosterone.
[02:06:13.060 --> 02:06:15.080]   And so while there isn't a direct relationship
[02:06:15.080 --> 02:06:17.260]   between dopamine stimulating testosterone,
[02:06:17.260 --> 02:06:20.220]   there is an interesting pathway whereby dopamine increases
[02:06:20.220 --> 02:06:23.320]   can trigger increases in things like luteinizing hormone,
[02:06:23.320 --> 02:06:26.080]   which can trigger increases in testosterone,
[02:06:26.080 --> 02:06:28.140]   as well as estrogen for that matter.
[02:06:28.140 --> 02:06:30.180]   So I know that there are a lot of people out there
[02:06:30.180 --> 02:06:31.960]   that are interested in the use of cold exposure
[02:06:31.960 --> 02:06:33.380]   for increasing testosterone.
[02:06:33.380 --> 02:06:35.360]   And some of those people in communities
[02:06:35.360 --> 02:06:40.240]   are indeed using cold exposure directly on the gonads,
[02:06:40.240 --> 02:06:42.440]   on the testes in order to do this.
[02:06:42.440 --> 02:06:46.360]   I'm not certain that that direct contact is necessary.
[02:06:46.360 --> 02:06:51.040]   And in some cases it might actually be quite dangerous
[02:06:51.040 --> 02:06:52.400]   or you at least should be careful
[02:06:52.400 --> 02:06:55.760]   in terms of tissues there and avoiding damage.
[02:06:55.760 --> 02:06:59.880]   But nonetheless, I think that a dopamine impact
[02:06:59.880 --> 02:07:04.040]   on testosterone is very likely given the 250% increases
[02:07:04.040 --> 02:07:06.380]   in dopamine that have been observed with cold water immersion
[02:07:06.380 --> 02:07:09.560]   and all of that points to the fact that cold water immersion
[02:07:10.680 --> 02:07:13.320]   very likely increases testosterone,
[02:07:13.320 --> 02:07:15.260]   but as a downstream consequence
[02:07:15.260 --> 02:07:18.160]   of the cold water immersion effects on dopamine
[02:07:18.160 --> 02:07:19.520]   and luteinizing hormone.
[02:07:19.520 --> 02:07:21.080]   And again, there's no reason to think
[02:07:21.080 --> 02:07:23.200]   that the increases in luteinizing hormone
[02:07:23.200 --> 02:07:25.240]   would also increase estrogen,
[02:07:25.240 --> 02:07:28.000]   probably not too dangerous
[02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:31.560]   or levels that one would want to avoid.
[02:07:31.560 --> 02:07:34.920]   But I don't think that there's anything particularly specific
[02:07:34.920 --> 02:07:38.140]   about cold for inducing testosterone and not other hormones.
[02:07:38.140 --> 02:07:39.320]   I think it's very likely to increase
[02:07:39.320 --> 02:07:41.540]   as a number of different hormones.
[02:07:41.540 --> 02:07:44.280]   I do hope that there will be a systematic study on this
[02:07:44.280 --> 02:07:45.800]   in the not too distant future.
[02:07:45.800 --> 02:07:47.720]   I also hope to not be a subject
[02:07:47.720 --> 02:07:50.360]   in the cooling of the gonads experiment.
[02:07:50.360 --> 02:07:52.540]   Now, I promise you the last topic was the last topic,
[02:07:52.540 --> 02:07:54.580]   but there's one other really important point
[02:07:54.580 --> 02:07:56.400]   that I think everyone should be aware of
[02:07:56.400 --> 02:07:59.020]   if you're going to use deliberate cold exposure.
[02:07:59.020 --> 02:08:01.920]   And that brings us back to the very first thing
[02:08:01.920 --> 02:08:03.460]   that we discussed today
[02:08:03.460 --> 02:08:05.160]   along the lines of deliberate cold exposure,
[02:08:05.160 --> 02:08:07.140]   which is that your baseline temperature
[02:08:07.140 --> 02:08:11.440]   is going to be lowest about two hours before you wake up.
[02:08:11.440 --> 02:08:15.040]   It's going to increase in the morning and as you wake up
[02:08:15.040 --> 02:08:17.240]   and increase throughout the day and afternoon,
[02:08:17.240 --> 02:08:19.200]   and then start to drop in the evening
[02:08:19.200 --> 02:08:21.440]   and come down at night as you head to sleep.
[02:08:21.440 --> 02:08:24.520]   I also want you to remember
[02:08:24.520 --> 02:08:27.980]   that if you are to cool the external portion of your body,
[02:08:27.980 --> 02:08:29.500]   in particular your torso,
[02:08:29.500 --> 02:08:31.940]   the net effect of that
[02:08:31.940 --> 02:08:35.480]   is going to be an increase in body temperature.
[02:08:35.480 --> 02:08:38.900]   So for many people, not all, but for many people,
[02:08:38.900 --> 02:08:41.960]   if you are going to do deliberate cold exposure,
[02:08:41.960 --> 02:08:45.180]   you are going to increase your core body temperature.
[02:08:45.180 --> 02:08:46.680]   And that makes sense if you think about
[02:08:46.680 --> 02:08:50.180]   how deliberate cold exposure can increase metabolism
[02:08:50.180 --> 02:08:52.400]   by increasing thermogenesis.
[02:08:52.400 --> 02:08:55.020]   What that all means is that
[02:08:55.020 --> 02:08:57.340]   if you are doing your deliberate cold exposure
[02:08:57.340 --> 02:08:58.700]   early in the day,
[02:08:58.700 --> 02:09:01.500]   you are going to get yet a further increase
[02:09:01.500 --> 02:09:03.040]   in core body temperature
[02:09:03.040 --> 02:09:05.620]   that would be associated with wakefulness,
[02:09:05.620 --> 02:09:07.460]   your ability to be alert that morning
[02:09:07.460 --> 02:09:10.260]   or throughout the day and so on.
[02:09:10.260 --> 02:09:13.880]   It also means that if you do your deliberate cold exposure
[02:09:13.880 --> 02:09:16.280]   very late in the evening or at night,
[02:09:16.280 --> 02:09:21.280]   so 6 p.m., 7 p.m., 9 p.m., and so on,
[02:09:21.280 --> 02:09:23.700]   you are going to increase your core body temperature.
[02:09:23.700 --> 02:09:25.780]   And if you recall,
[02:09:25.780 --> 02:09:29.500]   a decrease in core body temperature of one to three degrees
[02:09:29.500 --> 02:09:32.700]   is not just beneficial but is necessary
[02:09:32.700 --> 02:09:36.380]   in order to get into deep sleep and remain in deep sleep.
[02:09:36.380 --> 02:09:39.680]   So the takeaway from this is deliberate cold exposure
[02:09:39.680 --> 02:09:42.240]   done properly will increase your core body temperature
[02:09:42.240 --> 02:09:44.240]   and make you feel more alert.
[02:09:44.240 --> 02:09:46.200]   So if you're doing it early in the day,
[02:09:46.200 --> 02:09:48.160]   that's probably terrific,
[02:09:48.160 --> 02:09:50.940]   given that most of us want to be alert during the day.
[02:09:50.940 --> 02:09:53.220]   However, if you do it too late in the day,
[02:09:53.220 --> 02:09:55.880]   evening or night, it can disrupt sleep
[02:09:55.880 --> 02:09:58.780]   by way of disrupting your core body temperature.
[02:09:58.780 --> 02:10:00.900]   Now, the caveat to that is
[02:10:00.900 --> 02:10:04.400]   I myself tend to do my deliberate cold exposure
[02:10:04.400 --> 02:10:05.240]   early in the day,
[02:10:05.240 --> 02:10:07.540]   maybe not first thing in the morning, but mid-morning,
[02:10:07.540 --> 02:10:09.580]   maybe as late as three or four in the afternoon
[02:10:09.580 --> 02:10:10.420]   in some cases.
[02:10:10.420 --> 02:10:12.760]   In the longer days of summer, I might do it even later,
[02:10:12.760 --> 02:10:15.600]   5 or 6 p.m., and have no trouble sleeping.
[02:10:15.600 --> 02:10:18.940]   I have done deliberate cold exposure very late at night,
[02:10:18.940 --> 02:10:21.740]   10 p.m., 11 p.m., and so on,
[02:10:21.740 --> 02:10:23.200]   as part of a 30-day challenge
[02:10:23.200 --> 02:10:25.940]   of doing deliberate cold exposure every day for 30 days,
[02:10:25.940 --> 02:10:27.540]   and I got sloppy with my timing,
[02:10:27.540 --> 02:10:29.300]   and then in order to not miss a day,
[02:10:29.300 --> 02:10:30.940]   I would do it at 11 o'clock at night.
[02:10:30.940 --> 02:10:31.900]   And I must say,
[02:10:31.900 --> 02:10:35.340]   I found that I could still fall asleep very easily
[02:10:35.340 --> 02:10:38.060]   even doing deliberate cold exposure very late at night.
[02:10:38.060 --> 02:10:42.280]   However, on those particular days, I was particularly busy,
[02:10:42.280 --> 02:10:44.580]   and so I was particularly exhausted
[02:10:44.580 --> 02:10:46.860]   when I arrived at the deliberate cold exposure,
[02:10:46.860 --> 02:10:49.100]   and I had no trouble falling asleep
[02:10:49.100 --> 02:10:50.540]   after doing deliberate cold exposure
[02:10:50.540 --> 02:10:53.020]   and then taking a nice warm shower and then going to sleep.
[02:10:53.020 --> 02:10:54.580]   But I could imagine
[02:10:54.580 --> 02:10:56.940]   that because of the increases in core body temperature
[02:10:56.940 --> 02:10:59.340]   caused by deliberate cold exposure
[02:10:59.340 --> 02:11:02.060]   that were one to do that too late in the day,
[02:11:02.060 --> 02:11:04.860]   evening or night, that it could indeed disrupt your sleep.
[02:11:04.860 --> 02:11:07.680]   So my recommendation would be for most people,
[02:11:07.680 --> 02:11:09.220]   only do deliberate cold exposure
[02:11:09.220 --> 02:11:11.560]   if you are prepared to be fairly alert
[02:11:11.560 --> 02:11:14.820]   for the next one to four or maybe even six hours
[02:11:14.820 --> 02:11:17.000]   following that deliberate cold exposure.
[02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:18.180]   So for today's episode,
[02:11:18.180 --> 02:11:20.140]   as is the case with most episodes
[02:11:20.140 --> 02:11:23.180]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast, I covered a lot of material.
[02:11:23.180 --> 02:11:25.940]   We talked about mechanisms of catecholamines and stress
[02:11:25.940 --> 02:11:28.580]   and pulsatile release of epinephrine,
[02:11:28.580 --> 02:11:31.140]   metabolism, mental effects, performance,
[02:11:31.140 --> 02:11:33.860]   glabrous skin cooling, and on and on and on.
[02:11:33.860 --> 02:11:35.480]   And while the goal, of course,
[02:11:35.480 --> 02:11:38.500]   is to make sure that everyone arrives at specific,
[02:11:38.500 --> 02:11:41.740]   very clear mechanistic and actionable protocols,
[02:11:41.740 --> 02:11:44.780]   I do realize that it is an immense amount of information.
[02:11:44.780 --> 02:11:45.640]   And for that reason,
[02:11:45.640 --> 02:11:49.940]   I've created a list of deliberate cold exposure protocols
[02:11:49.940 --> 02:11:53.660]   aimed at improving mental toughness and resilience,
[02:11:53.660 --> 02:11:57.000]   mood, performance, metabolism,
[02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:59.440]   reducing inflammation, and so on and so forth.
[02:11:59.440 --> 02:12:02.700]   All of those have been condensed into succinct form
[02:12:02.700 --> 02:12:04.180]   and can be found
[02:12:04.180 --> 02:12:06.860]   at the Huberman Lab Neural Network Newsletter.
[02:12:06.860 --> 02:12:09.380]   This is a monthly or semi-monthly newsletter
[02:12:09.380 --> 02:12:11.540]   that we release that includes takeaways
[02:12:11.540 --> 02:12:13.660]   from the podcast and protocols.
[02:12:13.660 --> 02:12:16.460]   You can access those protocols, zero cost,
[02:12:16.460 --> 02:12:19.060]   by simply going to HubermanLab.com,

[02:12:34.660 --> 02:12:36.740]   And the protocols that I've designed
[02:12:36.740 --> 02:12:39.260]   should make it very straightforward for you to create
[02:12:39.260 --> 02:12:42.800]   a set of protocols that you could use with cold showers,
[02:12:42.800 --> 02:12:44.820]   with cold immersion, with or without ice,
[02:12:44.820 --> 02:12:46.300]   in combination with exercise,
[02:12:46.300 --> 02:12:47.940]   specifically for one goal or another,
[02:12:47.940 --> 02:12:50.580]   or to accomplish multiple goals simultaneously.

[02:13:27.620 --> 02:13:30.380]   It's patreon.com/andrewhuberman,

[02:13:32.220 --> 02:13:33.740]   at any level that you like.
[02:13:33.740 --> 02:13:36.340]   On many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:13:36.340 --> 02:13:37.820]   we talk about supplements.
[02:13:37.820 --> 02:13:39.940]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[02:13:39.940 --> 02:13:42.180]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[02:13:42.180 --> 02:13:43.940]   for things like sleep and focus
[02:13:43.940 --> 02:13:46.460]   and other aspects of health and performance.
[02:13:46.460 --> 02:13:47.960]   One issue with the supplement industry
[02:13:47.960 --> 02:13:49.580]   that's very serious, however,
[02:13:49.580 --> 02:13:51.640]   is that many supplement companies
[02:13:51.640 --> 02:13:53.820]   simply do not use high quality ingredients
[02:13:53.820 --> 02:13:57.180]   or the amounts of the ingredients they list on the packaging
[02:13:57.180 --> 02:13:59.800]   does not match what's actually contained in their products.
[02:13:59.800 --> 02:14:02.220]   For that reason, we partner with Thorne,
[02:14:02.220 --> 02:14:04.740]   T-H-O-R-N-E, because Thorne supplements
[02:14:04.740 --> 02:14:07.340]   are known to be of the very highest quality ingredients
[02:14:07.340 --> 02:14:10.100]   and the very highest degree of specificity
[02:14:10.100 --> 02:14:12.140]   in terms of the amounts of the ingredients
[02:14:12.140 --> 02:14:13.700]   that are listed on the packaging
[02:14:13.700 --> 02:14:16.620]   accurately match what's contained in their products.
[02:14:16.620 --> 02:14:18.560]   If you'd like to see the Thorne products that I take,
[02:14:18.560 --> 02:14:23.560]   you can go to Thorne, that's t-h-o-r-n-e.com/u/huberman.
[02:14:23.560 --> 02:14:26.160]   And there you can see the Thorne products that I take
[02:14:26.160 --> 02:14:28.580]   and get 20% off any of those products.
[02:14:28.580 --> 02:14:31.040]   In addition, if you navigate deeper into the Thorne site
[02:14:31.040 --> 02:14:32.380]   through that portal, Thorne,
[02:14:32.380 --> 02:14:36.360]   t-h-o-r-n-e.com/u/huberman,
[02:14:36.360 --> 02:14:38.800]   you can also get 20% off any of the other products
[02:14:38.800 --> 02:14:40.020]   that Thorne makes.
[02:14:40.020 --> 02:14:42.180]   If you're not already subscribed to Huberman Lab
[02:14:42.180 --> 02:14:44.440]   on Instagram and Twitter, please do so.
[02:14:44.440 --> 02:14:46.880]   There I cover science and science-related tools
[02:14:46.880 --> 02:14:49.600]   that sometimes overlap with the content of the podcast,
[02:14:49.600 --> 02:14:51.100]   but oftentimes is distinct
[02:14:51.100 --> 02:14:53.580]   from the information covered on this podcast.
[02:14:53.580 --> 02:14:56.400]   So thank you once again for joining me in the discussion
[02:14:56.400 --> 02:14:58.600]   about the use of deliberate cold exposure
[02:14:58.600 --> 02:14:59.940]   for health and performance.
[02:14:59.940 --> 02:15:02.220]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:15:02.220 --> 02:15:04.060]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:15:04.060 --> 02:15:06.640]   [upbeat music]
[02:15:06.640 --> 02:15:09.220]   (upbeat music)
