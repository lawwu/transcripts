[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.720]   We've long had a policy called decapitation. We long ago targeted the individual apartments
[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:14.240]   of this Russian leadership with individual warheads. I mean, in the window at high noon,
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:21.280]   because they were very accurate now. And they're totally stealthy if you're thinking about
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.800]   cruise missiles. We can put one in someone's window and it's a nuclear warhead and not just
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.560]   a high explosive. So they've known that for a long time. That doesn't give anybody time
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:38.240]   to get into the bomb shelter. I mean, this has gotten really very hairy, used to be pretty
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:45.120]   straightforward. Don't bomb us, we'll bomb you. Attack in some peripheral country and we won't
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.800]   bomb you because you might bomb us. We'll lose that little war, but we'll come in somewhere else.
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.720]   All of these things, that's complicated enough. But now we're talking about this other level.
