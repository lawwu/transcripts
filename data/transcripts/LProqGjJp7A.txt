[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.960]   You've also said that women are your vice.
[00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.440]   Do you feel like it's something that you struggle with?
[00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.280]   Or do you feel like it's like an addiction almost?
[00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:07.840]   I feel like that's every man's vice.
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.840]   There's very few men that don't struggle with liking girls.
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.080]   Like that's just what it is.
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.260]   Like since the beginning of time, the most prominent men have loved women.
[00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.120]   All the characters in the Bible, men of God, they fell because of women.
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.600]   King David with Bathsheba.
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.580]   You got King Solomon, who he was the wisest man in the world,
[00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.660]   but he had thousands of wives and concubines.
[00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.480]   So this isn't like a new story I'm saying.
[00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.700]   This is me just saying like me being honest
[00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.380]   about the struggles that a man may deal with.
