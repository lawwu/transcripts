[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   (music)
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Good Monday morning and welcome back to the podcast.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   We have talked recently about the tensions inside of a home
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   when a Christian is married to a non-Christian.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   This dynamic can happen for several reasons.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   Sometimes it's intentional.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   A Christian may sin and knowingly marry a non-Christian.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   We saw this in APJ 1560.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   Or two non-Christians marry and one of them eventually gets saved,
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   as we saw this in APJ 1029.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   Or two professing Christians get married.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   One proves their faith over the years or is genuinely converted at some point,
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   and the other falls away over time.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   We have seen this dynamic in APJs 1680, 1690, and in 1839.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   Just a couple of weeks ago we saw this.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   I don't know which category fits today.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   We have limited information, but Pastor John, six times over the years
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   we've gotten an email from a woman named Rose.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   Her emails are always the same.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   They're always brief.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   They're always one sentence.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   The same sentence.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   This one.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   "Pastor John, how do I pray for my husband to be saved?"
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   What would you say to Rose?
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   Oh, how I wish I could see into Rose's sorrowful heart
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   and pinpoint where does she feel the greatest difficulty
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   in praying for her unbelieving husband.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   Is it how often she should pray?
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   Is it how to avoid vain repetitions when you've been praying the same prayer
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   for what, years and years, hundreds of times, thousands of times?
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Is it how to keep on praying after decades of seeing no evident change?
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   Is it particular texts that she's struggling with and how to apply them?
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Is it loss of desire maybe or loss of hope or loss of love in her own heart?
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   Is it the cooling of trust in God?
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Is it practicalities like do I pray out loud or do I pray in a closet
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   or how many times a day?
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Is it whether it dishonors the husband to pray for him in groups maybe?
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   I've had women ask me that.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Is it whether to pray for him in his presence?
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Can I do that?
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Can I pray for him in his face?
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Is it whether to pray for others to reach out to him
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   or should I pray directly for his soul?
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Oh, how I wish I could see where the point is that she is asking about.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   But maybe she just--it's just a heart cry.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   "Help!"
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Anything you can say, Pastor John, that might encourage me
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   or keep me going.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   And so I don't know the details of her struggle,
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   except that it's been a long time evidently because of her repeated requests.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   And what I'd like to do is suggest a way of praying
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   for unbelieving loved ones that I have found hopeful.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   It's premised--I have to say this, it's really crucial to say--
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   it's premised on the biblical conviction that God is sovereign
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   and whenever he chooses, he can overcome all resistance
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   and save the hardest sinner.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   I do not believe that human beings have final veto power
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   over the sovereign will of God.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Some might think that this kind of absolute sovereignty
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   that I deeply believe is biblical,
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   this sovereignty over the human will,
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   would create a sense of fatalism, maybe,
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   or discouragement that God may not choose to save our loved one in the end.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   But looked at another way, it actually creates hope, this sovereign God.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   It means God really can save.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   No matter what the unbeliever does or has done, nothing can stop him.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   This means no amount of passing time, no amount of accumulated sin,
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   no degree of hardness of heart, no sneering antagonism,
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   no public mockery, no angry resistance,
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   nothing can hinder his salvation if God wills to take away the hardness and save.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   To me, that's the only hope we have, that unbelievers would be saved
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   because they're all dead in their trespasses and sins, and dead is dead.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   There's nothing I can do.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   If God doesn't do it, people perish.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   I would have perished.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   Building on this conviction of God's hope-sustaining sovereignty,
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   I love to pray the promises of God,
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   especially the new covenant promises of salvation.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   But before I mention a few of those,
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   I find it encouraging to remind myself, I must do this every week or so,
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   from time to time, from Scripture,
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   that God really does delight to answer the prayers of His children.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   I need to see that. I need to be reminded of that in His own words.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   He's not a begrudging Father.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   So, for example, I return often to Matthew 7, 9.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   "Which of you, if he has a son, who asks him for bread, would give him a stone?
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   Or if he asks for a fish, would give him a serpent?
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children,
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him?"
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   Or Luke 12, 32, "Fear not, little flock.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   It is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom."
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   Surely Jesus told us these things to encourage us to pray,
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   to remind us that we should think of Him this way,
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   a generous Father to His children.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   He loves to see us pray, a shepherd eager to bless,
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   a king eager to give to His subjects.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   And then, with that fresh reminder of God's eagerness to hear our prayers and answer them,
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   I turn to the promises of the new covenant.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   Now, remember that the new covenant, according to Jeremiah 31,
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   is different from the Mosaic covenant because it doesn't just come with demands from outside.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   It comes with enablement to do the commands from inside.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   He says, "I will cause you to walk in my statutes."
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   I'm not just giving you statutes.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   I cause you to walk in my statutes.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   That's the key of the new covenant.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   And Jesus said that this new covenant was secured by Himself, by His own blood.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   He held up the cup at the Last Supper.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   This cup is the new covenant in my blood.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   He bought it, and so it is sure.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   So, here are some of the precious new covenant promises
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   that I turn into prayers for beloved unbelievers.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   Ezekiel 1119.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   "I will give them one heart and a new spirit I will put within them.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   I will remove the heart of stone from their flesh and give them a heart of flesh
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   that they may walk in my statutes and keep my rules and obey them,
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   and they shall be my people and I will be their God."
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   So, pray like this for your husband.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   "Dear Father, I pray for my precious husband that you would, in your great mercy,
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   bought by the blood of Jesus, take out the heart of stone
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   and give him a tender, soft heart toward you.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   Put a new spirit in him.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   Give him a new disposition to love your word and keep it.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   Become his God.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   Make him your child."
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   Or here's another one.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   New covenant promise from Deuteronomy 6, verse 30.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   God looks to the day when a prophet like Moses will arise, namely Jesus,
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   and promises this for his chosen ones.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   "The Lord your God will circumcise your heart and the heart of your offspring
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   so that you will love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   that you may live."
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   So, you pray, "Oh, Father, none of us loves you first and turns your heart to love us.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   We can't love you unless you, in your great, free, gracious love,
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   first circumcise our hearts.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   You must cut away the old nature of self-exaltation and self-rule.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   You did this for me.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   I didn't deserve that any more than my husband does.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   Oh, God, I plead with you.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   Circumcise his heart so that it is set free from resistance to your truth
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   and goodness and beauty.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   Cause him, oh, Lord, to love you because of Christ."
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   Or think of the instruction and the promise in 2 Timothy 2, 24 to 26.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   It applies, I think, to all of us who in any time use the word and prayer
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   to try to lead an unbeliever out of darkness.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   It says this, "The Lord's servant," now that would be me, that would be this wife,
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   "The Lord's servant must not be quarrelsome but kind to everyone,
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   able to teach, patiently enduring evil, correcting his opponents with gentleness.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   God may perhaps grant them repentance, leading to a knowledge of the truth,
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   and they may come to their senses and escape from the snare of the devil,
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   having been captured by him to do his will."
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   So we pray, Father, even though no one deserves to be saved,
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   no one deserves the gift of repentance, no one deserves escape from the devil,
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   nevertheless, you are a God of mercy.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   I know this because I escaped when I was just as blind and snared
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   in deadness of heart as my husband.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   Here I am praying, loving you, trusting you, amazing grace in my life.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   So you are a God of mercy, and if you will, you can grant repentance
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   and liberation and faith and life.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   I know you have mercy on whom you have mercy.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   I know you are free and all wise, and as your child,
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   I am asking that for the glory of your grace,
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   you would give repentance to my husband.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   And we could go on, of course, on and on, in fact,
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   turning the promises and the works of God into prayers.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   We could turn Acts 16, 14 into, "Lord, open his heart like you did Lydia's,"
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   or we could turn 2 Corinthians 4, 6 into, "Father, shine into their hearts
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   with the light of the gospel of the glory of God in the face of Christ,"
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   or we could pray the words of Jesus in Luke 18, 27,
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   "Lord Jesus, you said of the conversion of the rich man,
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   'What is impossible with man is possible with God.'
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   So do the impossible, I pray. Convert my husband."
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   So, Rose, we are with you in this great work of wrestling in prayer
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   for your beloved unbeliever.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   Let's not forget the words of Jesus in Luke 18, 1,
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   "Always pray and do not lose heart."
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   Amen. Thank you. And thank you, Rose, for persisting in your APJ emails to us.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   I hope this was helpful to you as you persist in your prayers
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   and find fresh motivation from that great parable in Luke 18.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   Always pray and don't lose heart.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   I was just thinking of this parable too, Pastor John, as you were talking.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   It's a memorable one, and it fits this episode so well for what Rose is facing.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   And it's also a very odd parable as well.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   God is the godless, unjust judge in the story, at least it seems.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   So how on earth do we make sense of that parable?
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   We need to untangle some things to understand its implications for our prayer lives.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   In fact, let's do that. Let's do that next time.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   Let's look at Luke 18, verses 1-8 more closely.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   I'm your host, Tony Rehnke. We'll see you back here on Wednesday.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   Thanks for listening to the podcast.
