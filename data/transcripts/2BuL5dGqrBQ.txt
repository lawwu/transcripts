[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.640]   All right.
[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:12.020]   We have a question here from Career Opportunist who says,
[00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:17.840]   "Are there times where it is worthwhile to follow intimations of your career
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.080]   interest, even if you take non-trivial cuts in your career capital outside of
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.760]   the corner cases you've already mentioned in your book so good they can't ignore
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:24.960]   you?"
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.240]   Right.
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.360]   There's some elaboration here.
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.200]   So we can get some context to this question.
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.800]   So Career Opportunist clarifies that he is a back-end software engineer at a
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.760]   large, well-known internet company who has built up quite a bit of career
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.400]   capital in that role.
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:45.360]   He then goes on to say, "My core interest in college, however, were in front-end
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.480]   client-facing work as opposed to back-end software.
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.000]   I'm not tied to a particular job or passion.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.600]   I just want to experience building user-facing software as opposed to just
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.120]   behind-the-scenes code."
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.960]   So he says, "I can either choose to become a more proficient back-end engineer, but
[00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.840]   it does feel like a less interesting route for me.
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.520]   But I could do that and focus instead on the opportunities to negotiate lifestyle
[00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.000]   improvements."
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.400]   All right.
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.360]   So I don't have a definitive answer, but I'll tell you my instinct here.
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.520]   The grudging thing you put at the end, like I guess what I could do is even
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.960]   though maybe front-end stuff seems more interesting, I could get better at
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.480]   back-end engineering and focus more on lifestyle improvements.
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.360]   I actually think that's probably the right answer.
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.720]   And it might not be the answer you want to hear from me, but I think at this stage
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.680]   of your career, the right thing to do, I'm going to guess, you haven't told me, but
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.400]   I'm going to guess you're at that critical stage, this roughly quarter-life stage in
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.440]   your late 20s, early 30s, where you're no longer starting out, you have skill, you
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.400]   have talent, you begin to have some options, but you're also not at that mid-life
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.120]   stage where there's other things going on in your life.
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.400]   I would say at this stage, this is an important time to do lifestyle-centric
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.240]   career planning.
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.800]   I'll explain what that is in a second, but what I think is going on instead is
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.320]   you're feeling a bit adrift because again, you've got to that quarter-life stage
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.800]   where you found the job, you found the skill, you have some stability, you have
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.520]   some ability, and now you're thinking what's next.
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.600]   And in our culture, and especially American culture, when I say our culture,
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:26.360]   we have this instinct that the content of our job is going to be the key
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.600]   driver of our satisfaction.
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.400]   So when you feel that initial tinge of malaise, because you've reached a plateau,
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:39.000]   your culturally trained mind immediately says, well, maybe if we shifted a little
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.480]   bit, the content of our work, we would no longer be adrift, we would break through
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.960]   the malaise.
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.280]   So maybe it's back in software is the issue.
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.200]   And the reason why I'm feeling this malaise is that I really should be doing
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.040]   front-end software.
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.800]   I think if you make that shift, it would be kind of interesting, but you'd be back
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.920]   in the same place in a couple of years.
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.120]   So now is the time to do lifestyle-centric career planning, which is what I think is
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.160]   the answer to that feeling that so many standard knowledge worker types feel
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.280]   around this part in their life.
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.280]   Now I've talked about this before, but the basics of lifestyle-centric career
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:15.720]   planning is that you identify what do I want my day-to-day life to be like in all
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.080]   of its attributes, not what do I want my work to be like, what do I want my actual
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.240]   life to be like?
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.440]   And I want you to think about things like, where am I living?
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.600]   Am I in the countryside?
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.880]   Am I in a skyscraper?
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.360]   Am I in a small town?
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.040]   Am I helping my neighbors build a barn?
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:39.040]   Or is it I am having people over, commonly just shooting the breeze out on a front
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.800]   porch while people walk by?
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:48.280]   Or is it I'm at a underground bar scene where there's interesting new poetry being
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.560]   done?
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.960]   Whatever.
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:49.800]   What is my day like?
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:50.480]   What am I doing?
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.480]   Where do I live?
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.760]   How much am I working?
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.280]   Am I getting after it or is work a small part of my job?
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.360]   Am I seasonal?
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.680]   Am I spending six months a year not even working at all and doing other types of
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.200]   things and traveling around?
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.120]   These type of questions.
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.400]   What am I doing with my time?
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.680]   What about my character?
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.160]   What is my role in the community?
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.360]   What is the philosophies by which I live?
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.400]   How deep is my existential grasp of my life?
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.680]   All of these type of questions.
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.400]   You fix this lifestyle.
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.360]   You feel it and you taste it and you imagine a typical week or day and something that
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.960]   really hits those intimations of, yes, this is right.
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.520]   And then you say, great, what are the paths to get there?
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.600]   And that's where you build your plan.
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.320]   And work then fits into that plan.
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.560]   And work then becomes a mechanism by which you make progress towards this lifestyle
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.680]   that pushes all of these right buttons and really resonates.
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.640]   And that is where, as you enter this quarter-life period, your focus goes.
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:52.920]   Aiming the ship that is your life towards the port that is a lifestyle that is deeper,
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.160]   that resonates with you, whatever those answers might be.
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:00.360]   And again, I keep emphasizing different people have different answers to these
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.480]   questions. It could look very different depending on the people.
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.800]   That's where I'd want you to put your energy.
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.440]   Now, if you do this exercise eight times out of 10, you're going to find, oh, if I
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.640]   have a lot of career capital in something like back in software design, massively
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.320]   increasing that capital, because it's easy to take good capital and make it great than
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.640]   it is to go from no capital to good capital, massively increasing that capital
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.880]   quickly and using that as a lever to take control of aspects of my life and career is
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.680]   almost always going to be the right thing to do.
[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.840]   An example comes to mind from my book, So Good They Can't Ignore You, which you
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.080]   mentioned, there was a very similar character in that book, someone in a very
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.400]   similar situation to you.
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.320]   This was Lulu.
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.200]   And she was a back-end programmer.
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:47.200]   I believe she was databases, more like a database programmer designer, but similar
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.880]   idea, not front-end facing, worked for financial sectors.
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:57.520]   As she got better and better at that, she said, what did I want my life to be like?
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.000]   And she used that as a lever to build a really cool lifestyle where she did six
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.040]   months on, six months off.
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.760]   So she left the company where she was.
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:05.840]   She went to a consulting role.
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.920]   She was heavily in demand because she was great on this.
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.440]   She would do six months on.
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.400]   That's roughly enough time to do one or two engagements.
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:17.160]   She lived relatively cheaply, right?
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.600]   With her wife in Jamaica Plain.
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.000]   It was a cool, it's a cool neighborhood outside of Boston.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.040]   They had this cool old house that they were, they were renovating.
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.560]   And they weren't living lavishly.
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.040]   They weren't living in, let's go buy a really large, expensive house.
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.400]   So then you could spend the other six months doing interesting things and
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.320]   scuba diving.
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:33.560]   She got a pilot's license.
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.800]   Her family was from Thailand.
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.360]   So she would go do extended visits there.
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:41.280]   And it was just a really interesting lifestyle, but she figured out what she
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:41.800]   wanted.
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.680]   And then she said, what's the best way to get there?
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.680]   Oh, I'm a great database developer.
[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.920]   I can wield that to get where I want to get.
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:52.160]   So that is what I'm going to suggest for opportunities is do the lifestyle
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:57.520]   centric career planning, thinking and work backwards to say, how do I get there?
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.760]   And then see where that takes you.
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:05.400]   So again, it's likely it might take you, uh, we'll tell you almost certainly take
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.680]   the skill you have out for a spin and use it to build a cool life.
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:10.360]   It might tell you, however, when you do this, like you want to be running a
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.440]   small startup that's front end facing and you live kind of cheap and you're
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:14.360]   living somewhere kind of cool.
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:17.280]   So maybe it would put you to front end facing work, but it would be pushing you
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:19.360]   there for a reason.
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.960]   This is part of a big picture, not just an instinct that maybe this would make me
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:23.360]   happier.
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:28.360]   The final thing I will say, if you're interested in front end design, just as
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:34.000]   an intriguing intellectual challenge, even if this exercise has you stick with
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.240]   back end programming and using that as your main leverage, your main career
[00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:40.160]   capital lever, do some front end work as a hobby.
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:47.680]   Build a front end facing website that you do as a side hustle or a side project
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:51.720]   that you build up and build up those skills, build it around something you're
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:52.920]   really interested in.
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:58.320]   You know, like you're a, uh, some sort of like super fan of the matrix or
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:58.960]   something like this.
[00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.160]   I just watched that movie last night.
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:00.960]   That's what I'm thinking about it.
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:02.720]   Uh, Jesse's shaking his head.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.360]   Um, you're a super fan of the matrix or something like this and whatever, or
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.800]   you're, you're really into some.
[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:10.920]   I'm not good with this dungeons and dragons or something.
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.680]   I don't know, but you know what I'm saying?
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.320]   Like, okay, build it about something interesting, fun, a community that you
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.800]   get some depth out of, uh, whatever it is.
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.160]   And you could get that experience as well.
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:19.600]   All right.
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.240]   So that's a long answer to a short question, because I really wanted to get
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:23.640]   to that bigger point, which is.
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:30.040]   I'm increasingly a big believer in this idea that stage one of your career is
[00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:34.360]   figuring out how to be a adult in the world who's dependable and gets things
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:38.840]   done and starts to develop a real skill to get real career capital stage to.
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:43.280]   Deploy that capital towards a vision of the ideal lifestyle.
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:47.240]   And then stage three is actually probably going to be much less career focused.
[00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.360]   You're in this lifestyle.
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:51.160]   It's going to be much more about yourself and self-discovery.
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:55.440]   I mean, I think it sets you up for the classic midlife crisis for it, not to be
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.400]   a crisis, but to be a time of actual discovery.
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:58.880]   So that's my advice.
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:01.720]   Lifestyle-centered career planning underrated.
[00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.200]   Can't emphasize it enough.
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:10.680]   [Music]
