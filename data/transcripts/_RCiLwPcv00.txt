[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.680]   Let's do a few more questions here.
[00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:06.520]   I have one from Katie.
[00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:13.040]   Katie says, "I know thinking deep is a thought or work process of younger adults, but how
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.080]   about addressing the older population?
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.040]   Retirees like myself have lots of time on their hands.
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.480]   And really, after you've worked so long in one profession, you don't know what to do
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.840]   with so much time.
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.640]   I'd like to learn Spanish or be more productive, but who knows in what?
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.680]   And how does deep thinking become a process in our life?"
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:38.160]   Well Katie, earlier in this show, we did this question a few times.
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.000]   And what I would often come back to is for people who are later in life who are retiring
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.960]   or have retired, the deep life bucket method becomes very important.
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:57.800]   Now go watch my video on the deep life core idea, youtube.com/CalNewportMedia.
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.120]   Watch that video to get brought up to speed on what the deep life bucket method is.
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:07.400]   But there is fewer circumstances where this method is more effective than for people who
[00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.400]   are retired.
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.600]   Because what it's going to force you to do is look at the different elements of your
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.600]   life that are important.
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.880]   And then for each of those, get rid of the noise and boost the signal.
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.560]   Get rid of the junk that's not returning you much and put in place habits and endeavors
[00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.880]   that are really giving you a high return on time investment.
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.160]   And when you're retired, you have a lot more time to invest.
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.320]   So this process becomes more exciting.
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.320]   But the bucket method where you're breaking up your life into these different parts prevents
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.800]   you from having capture in just one element of your life or from getting too lost in minutia.
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.960]   It gives you some structure to this whole process.
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.200]   So I think it's one of the exciting things about retirement is you can re-engineer your
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.760]   life in this systematic way.
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:52.120]   And you have so much more levers to pull and knobs to turn than say someone who is up to
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:57.760]   their ears midlife at a peak of their career trajectory, which is eating up all their time
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.080]   and every minute that remains is wrangling kids.
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.320]   I mean, you now have the promised land, Katie, which is some some room to actually do some
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.000]   cool things with your life.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.040]   So go go listen to that.
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.040]   Watch that video.
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.660]   I'd say not listen, but watch that video on the deep life.
[00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.640]   The bucket method will help organize your efforts going forward.
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:25.640]   [MUSIC]
